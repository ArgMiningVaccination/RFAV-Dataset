It is based on cases studies of three northern European books from the twelfth century and the illustrations of surgery, anatomy, and medical authorities contained therein (Durham, Cathedral Library, Hunter 100; London, BL, Harley MS 1585; Munich, BSB, Clm 13002). Previous scholarship separated such images from their manuscript contexts and focused almost exclusively on their medical meaning and function. This study reinterprets the medical images in situ and finds other connotations and uses that relate to the theological, intellectual, and institutional concerns of the monasteries in which they were created. An iconological assessment of the imagery in these manuscripts reveals that portrayals of diseased bodies also reflect degrees of sin; peculiar features of surgical procedures represent divine intervention; and certain images of disease, suffering, and cure are associated with the rigor of monastic discipline and its goal of salvation. Furthermore, a consideration of the use and placement of the medical illustrations within the manuscripts highlights the complex visual and codicological strategies used to create additional layers of iii meaning. Juxtapositions of different kinds of illustrations, recurring textual themes, the structural practice of bookending, and repetition of colour and specific imagery create relationships that contribute to the monastic authors' larger intellectual and ideological programs. Moreover, these relationships, viewed within the spiritual and educational practice of monastic meditatio, broaden the conceptions of the body, sickness, cure, and health such that medical illustrations could expound a sophisticated Christology while at the same time support the reform or reinvigoration of \"unhealthy\" institutional \"bodies.\" In the monastic milieu of the twelfth-century, images of the human body and medical procedures did not necessarily serve the same purposes they would in the later setting of the university. As the three manuscripts treated here demonstrate, they could also serve to communicate profound theological insight; substantiate a monastery's intellectual and institutional needs; and visualize an ideal \"body\" intended as a model for salvation. iv Acknowledgements It has been ten years since I returned to school to do \"what I should have done\" many years before. These years have been a pleasure, a luxurious time for in-depth reading, research, and discovery. At the same time they have been difficult, and I would not have gotten through them without the help of many people. Foremost thanks go to my supervisor, Dr. Adam Cohen, who introduced what became my research topic and whose wise guidance, patience, and thoughtful direction got me to the finish line. Dr. Jill Caskey's insights helped to clarify many of my arguments and her support at key times kept me in the program. Dr. Faith Wallis's vast knowledge of medieval medicine and science saved me from numerous blunders and sparked new directions for my research. I would also like to thank my external readers, Dr. Cathleen Hoeniger and Dr. Cillian O'Hogan for asking tough questions and pushing the borders of my research. I am particularly grateful for Dr. O'Hogan's careful review of my transcriptions and translations. It is likely that I would not have taken on this project without the financial support of numerous entities. I thank the Vanier Canada Graduate Scholar Program, the Ontario Graduate Scholar Program, and the Department of Art History at the University of Toronto for many years of funding; the Michael Smith Foundation and the School of Graduate Studies at the University of Toronto who provided the means to pursue a long research trip; and Prof. Peter Murray Jones who generously offered to sponsor my stay in the UK. Most of all, I would also like to thank my family. My late father always encouraged intellectual curiosity and regularly prodded me to return to school and pursue a Ph.D. My mother, husband, sister, sons, and J. tolerated my early hours and sometimes intense dinner conversations and kept me laughing through the many years of classwork and writing. This v work is dedicated to my husband, Matthew, without whose love, help, and support I could not have completed it. vi Table of Contents Abstract .................................................................................................................................... ii Acknowledgements ................................................................................................................ iv Table of Contents ................................................................................................................... vi List of Tables ........................................................................................................................ viii List of Figures ......................................................................................................................... ix List of Abbreviations .......................................................................................................... xxv Introduction Chapter 1.

These modern medical illustrations typically function as explanatory devices intended to instruct, often by clarifying or reinforcing an accompanying text. They both represent and teach \"real life\" medicine: what a patient can expect from an operation, what a surgeon can expect to see when opening a body, or the step-by-step procedures to be followed by the doctor. Such reasons for including illustrations in medical books may seem obvious to us. But in twelfth-century Western Europe this was not necessarily the case. Medieval images relating to health and medicine often served very different purposes than they do today.1 Medical knowledge in Western Europe before the twelfth century was conveyed less through schools and books than through apprenticeships and personal relationships. The medical books that exist from the period are largely occasional compilations\u2014no two manuscripts are alike\u2014and most are composed of short abstracts of largely practical (as 1 In general, I consider here those illustrations that have been defined as \"medical\" by previous scholars, understanding that there is always a danger of anachronism when one uses a modern word for a historical phenomenon. Here by 'medical' and 'medicine,' I refer to those cultural practices and ideas involving physical and mental health, disease, and cure by human-made products or participation. I do not directly refer to those experiences of purely supernatural healing (healings through proximity to saintly relics, miracle, or directly by God), although, as discussed below, divine intervention in \"medicine\" is not ruled out. This dissertation partially aims to better characterize the concept of medicine during the twelfth century. 2 opposed to theoretical) medical knowledge culled from ancient authorities. They also contain only a few types of illustrations. These include depictions of plants and animals used in medications, representations of various fetal presentations, and portrayals of a few types of surgical procedures. Furthermore, these books and illustrations emerged chiefly within a religious context. It was not in the main professional practitioners of medicine who copied and used these works but monks and clerics. Not until the thirteenth century, when books began to be used in a university setting to train doctors, who by then were considered professionals, do we find the first formalized medical texts that are the forerunners of the modern scientific medical book. Medical illustrations did not become an important part of the university based pedagogical tradition until later. The twelfth century thus represents a fascinating time of transition for medical knowledge in Western Europe. During a period that has been defined as the \"long twelfth century\" (1075-1225), numerous Greek and Arabic medical works were translated into Latin at various centers culturally connected with the East (Southern Italy, Islamic Spain, and Syria) and then disseminated throughout Western Europe.2 These texts introduced a more systematic and theoretical approach to medicine along with a rational understanding of the 2 Many scholars have distinguished the period of approximately 1050-1225 as unified by different factors. One of the earliest, Charles Homer Haskins, The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1927/8), places the origins of a renaissance before 1100 and claims it ends around 1250. Others have specifically used the name \"the Long Twelfth Century.\" See, for example, John D. Cotts, Europe's Long Twelfth Century: Order, Anxiety and UK: Palgrave McMillen, 2013); and Thomas F.X. Noble and John Van Engen, eds., European Transformations: The Long Twelfth Century (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 2011). More recently, a group of scholars headed by Monica Green have been compiling a list of medical manuscripts and texts from this period, defined as between 1080-1225. Green work's singles out this century as an important time for the foundation of medical learning, pedagogy, and ultimately canonical texts. She discusses the findings in \"Medical Books,\" in The European Book in the Twelfth Century, eds. Erik Kwakkel and Rodney M. Thomson (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2018). For more on the project, see Green, \"Medical Manuscripts from the Long Twelfth Century,\" News from the Vatican Film Library 8 (2013): 11. 3 body and of healing that supplemented (but did not supplant) the more practical and religious outlook that for centuries had dominated European medicine. As the number of medical texts and manuscripts dramatically increased, so too did certain new types of medical illustrations. The earliest surviving images of full-body anatomy appear in the twelfth century (the \"Five-Picture Series\")3 as do depictions of what today we consider surgery--namely, cutting into the body with a knife.4 The twelfth century also produced the earliest medieval illustrations of bloodletting and the trepanation of the head. Images of another type of surgical remedy involving the use of cautery irons also increased, as did variations in the types of illnesses treated and the ways of depicting them. While the breadth of medical images expanded, there are still some peculiar features that distinguish the twelfth-century illustrations from those that later prevailed in the scholastic era. For example, many are highly decorated with gold borders and rich colours. Some include religious motifs. Others, including the earliest depictions of anatomy, do not appear in books containing medical texts but rather in glossaries and biblical commentaries. Another set of surgical images appears alongside prayers to an earth goddess and herbs. 3 Karl Sudhoff, Ein Beitrag Medizin (Leipzig: J.A. Barth, 1908), was the first scholar to record the series of five anatomical men, known as the \"Funfbilderserie (Five-Picture Series).\" 4 The word chirurgia indicated that which is \"performed by the hand\" and had a much broader meaning in the ancient and medieval world. In general, chirurgia referred not only to cutting into the body with a knife, but also cautery, cupping, bandaging, orthopedics, and wound care. As discussed below, there are other earlier surviving illustrations of what would have been included in the medieval conception of surgery: cautery, bandaging and orthopedics. Faith Wallis, \"Pre-Modern Surgery: Wounds, and the Paradox of 'Tradition,'\" in Palgrave MacMilllan Handbook of the History of Surgery, ed. Thomas Schlick (London: Palgrave MacMillan, 2018), 49-70, 51. 4 Perhaps understandably, there has been some scholarly wariness towards these twelfth-century medical illustrations. Indeed, the vast majority have been examined independent of their potentially problematic manuscript context. In addition, scholarship has been divided along modern disciplinary lines. Historians of science have generally studied only those images that seem to function within the scope of medical education. Any iconographical religious features have either been explained medically or as mistakes created by unlearned monastic artists. Art historians have largely classified the illustrations as secular--even though created by monks--and thereby subordinate to sacred images.5 Consequently, they have not received the same amount of attention as religious material deemed more important. Rather than treat the images and manuscripts in question as stages in the emergence of modern medicine, they deserve to be understood and interpreted from the perspective of the twelfth-century monastic milieux that produced them. Far from being ignorant of the advances taking place in the knowledge of medicine during this time, the monasteries were, in fact, long-established intellectual centers and some of the first recipients of the newly translated texts. It is naive to think that the monks who produced twelfth-century medical illustrations were ill-informed of the new knowledge or misunderstood its import. In this dissertation, I consider such illustrations and the manuscripts that contain them as constructed objects that both shape and reflect their creators and users. I also subscribe to the hypothesis that twelfth-century medical images contain multiple meanings and function in 5 The term \"secular\" art in the medieval context is problematic. For a discussion of its use in relation to \"sacred\" art, see Alicia Walker and Amanda Luyster, \"Introduction. Mapping the Heavens and Treading the Earth: Negotiating Secular and Sacred in Medieval Art,\" in Negotiating Secular and Sacred in Medieval Art: Christian, Islamic, and Buddhist, eds. Walker and Luyster (Farnham, Surrey and Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2007), 1-16. 5 many ways within their manuscript context--namely, that they can convey medical knowledge and at the same time represent the religious convictions, or even serve the political purposes, of the monastic house in which they were created. I explore these issues via three different manuscripts, each created during the twelfth century in a monastic scriptorium, two of which were considered important enough to be copied by other monasteries, and the other a likely gift for a bishop. In so doing, I delve more deeply not only into the history of medicine, but also into the history of the individual monasteries that produced the works and the ideologies and issues that affected them. Medical Images in Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages In order to get a better sense of the meaning of medical illustrations in the twelfth century, it is helpful to consider them within a broader historical context. Some of the earliest images depicting scenes related to medicine did not always function to aid medical learning. For example, depictions of medical procedures appear during antiquity on Greek vases, cups, and domestic wall paintings. A small fourth century BCE vase portrays a doctor performing bloodletting in a clinical setting (fig. 1) while an Eros hovers above (fig. 2).6 Pottery and wall paintings represent medical scenes from mythological literature: on the former, Achilles bandages Patroclus in a poignant image from the Iliad (fig. 3), and, on the latter, the doctor Iapyx treats the wound of Aeneas, the founder of Rome, while Venus and his crying child 6 Peytel Aryballos, Paris, Louvre, CA 2183 (480-470 BCE). An aryballos is a small vase, this one being 8 cm in height and 8 cm in diameter, and is used to hold oil. In addition to the bloodletting scene and the Eros, the Peytel Aryballos also depicts other waiting patients, a servant, and an additional Eros. For more on the object and others of its kind, see J. D. Beazley, \"Aryballos,\" The Annual of the British School at Athens 29 (1927/28): 187-215. 6 look on (fig. 4).7 All of these images were produced by professional lay artists and show techniques of practical medicine, but they are clearly not intended to teach medicine. Medical illustrations associated with medical texts likely have their root in the Hellenistic period when schools of medicine and libraries flourished in the Eastern Mediterranean. While no illustration from that time survives, some of the medical works written during this period, whose texts have been transmitted to us via later copies, do include references to (now lost) images associated with practical procedures and the materials required for medicines. Pliny, for example, describes the illustrations of plants in medical works by Greek authors and also casts doubt on their usefulness.8 [N]ot only is a picture misleading when the colours are so many, particularly as the aim is to copy Nature, but besides this, much imperfection arises from the manifold hazards in the accuracy of copyists. In addition, it is not enough for each plant to be painted at one period only of its life, since it alters its appearance with the fourfold changes of the year....For this reason the other writers have given verbal accounts only; some have not even given the shape of the plants, and for the most part have been content with bare names, since they thought it sufficient to point out the properties and nature of a plant to those willing to look for it. 9 According to Pliny, there were a range of methods to teach medical botany in the first century, and illustrations did not fulfill that purpose. Despite Pliny's judgement of the misleading nature of images, the practice continued. Indeed, his description of their 7 Achilles-Patroklos Cup, Berlin, Antikenmuseen, Berlin F 2278 (Etruria, 500 BCE); and wall-painting Museo Nazionale, inv.no.9009 (Pompeii, House of Siricus, first century CE).

Pliny states that the authors, Crataeus, Dionysius, and Metrodorus \"painted the likenesses of plants and then wrote under them their properties.\" 9 Ibid. 7 placement on the page mimics what is found in the earliest surviving papyrus fragments (first, second, and fourth centuries CE) (fig. 5).10 As for medical theory, which flourished among Greek thinkers during Antiquity, there are no similar references to images nor do any actual depictions exist.11 The earliest surviving illustrations are from the early medieval period with references to the theory of the four humors derived from Ancient Greece (fig. 6).12 Perhaps the closest thing we have in this regard are ancient depictions of Hippocrates, the originator of humoral theory, portrayed in the dress of a philosopher (fig. 7).13 Many more images survive from the Early Middle Ages, ca. 500 to ca. 1080 CE, which historians of medicine refer to as the \"pre-Salernitan\" period. This division is linked to the era before the rise of medical schools, the most famous being the one in Salerno, as well as the development of canonical texts for medieval medical education.14 The texts that 10 Symphyton, the Johnson Papyrus, London, Wellcome Institute Library, MS 5753, fragment recto (ca. 400 C.E.).

During this period, the dominant imagery of healing concerns Christ and his disciples and is based on scenes from biblical texts. These appear in manuscripts, on portable objects, and in churches and abbeys as wall paintings. As for those images associated with medical works, the majority of extant illustrations depict materia medica, that is, the plants and animals from which medications can be produced. One exceptional work, created in Constantinople, contains over three hundred lavishly produced illustrations (Vienna, \u00d6sterreichische Nationalbibliothek, Cod. med. gr. 1, \"Vienna Dioscorides\") (fig. 8).16 The intended recipient of the manuscript was not a doctor but the daughter of the Roman Emperor. The manuscript was dedicated to Juliana Anicia in 512 CE as a gift in response to her donation of the funds for a church in a district of Constantinople; a depiction of her between the personifications of Magnanimity and Prudence appears on folio 6v (fig. 9).17 The vast majority of surviving illustrated materia medica are, however, not so elaborately produced and were created in Western Europe rather than the East (fig. 10).18 In accordance scuola M\u00e9decine Moyen Age dans les Biblioth\u00e8ques de France (Paris: \u00c9ditions du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 1966). 16 Rosa centifolia, Vienna, \u00d6sterreichische Nationalbibliothek, Cod. med. gr. 1, fol. 282r. 17 For more on the Vienna Dioscorides, its contents, and illustrations, see Collins, Medieval Herbals, 39-50. 18 Aron, Asarum, and Affodillus, Munich, BSB, Clm 337, fol. 66v (tenth century, Italy). In the Arabic tradition, no illustrations of materia medica survive, though there is evidence of translations of 9 with the stylistic trends in Europe during this period, the figures of flora and fauna are largely abstract and not true to life--stylistic features that further limit their scientific, identificatory use. The non-naturalistic style of the images is particularly pronounced in illustrations from Northern Europe, a region that also produced more expensive volumes using finer drawing and more color than those produced in Italy.19 In addition to depictions of materia medica, there are also images of ancient medical authorities.20 The Greek manuscript given to Juliana Anicia depicts the author Dioscorides interacting with pagan personifications (fig. 11) and in discussion with other famous ancient medical writers, perhaps debating their various medical philosophies (fig. 12).21 In the Western tradition, medical authors are often depicted seated similar to illustrations of powerful kings or even the evangelists (fig. 13-14). There is even an example of an author placed in a position similar to Christ as ruler of the world (fig. 15).22 Representations of mythological beings traditionally thought to have provided herbal medical knowledge also Dioscorides's text in the eighth century by the Ummayad Caliphs, which may or may not have included images.

In general, surgery had a broad meaning in the ancient and medieval period that encompassed not only procedures using a knife but also cautery, bloodletting, bandaging, and orthopedics. While no such illustrations survive from Northern Europe, they do appear in 23 Goddess Diana conveying medical knowledge to Chiron, Florence, Laurenziana, MS Plut. 73.41, fol. 23r (ninth century, Italy); and Chiron and Aesculapius handing down medical knowledge to \"Plato,\" London, BL, Cotton MS Vitellius C.

For more on this manuscript, see Emilie Savage-Smith, \"Anatomical Illustration in Arabic Manuscripts,\" in Arab Painting: Text and Image in Illustrated Arabic Manuscripts, ed. Anna Contadini (Leiden: Brill, 2007), 145-159, 151. A schematic drawing of the eye appears in an Arabic manuscript from 1083 CE, Istanbul, S\u00fcleimaniye Mosque Library, MS Fatih 3212, vol. 1, fol. 81b. 11 manuscripts from Italy and the Eastern Mediterranean. The earliest example of an illustrated surgery comes from the ninth century, likely originating from the monastery of Monte Cassino, and depicts sixteen full-page cautery procedures (fig. 20).27 From the tenth century, one illustration of proper bandaging (fig. 21) and another of orthopedic techniques (fig. 22) survive in a single manuscript likely created in Constantinople.28 Finally, Emile Savage-Smith remarks that Arabic manuscripts from as early as the ninth century include branch diagrams (tashjr) that map the relationships between diseases.29 With the important exception of cautery images, the pre-Salernitan medical illustrations accompany related medical texts.30 The nature and content of these texts vary 27 Florence, Laurenziana, MS Plut. 73.41, fol. Collins, Medieval Herbals, 180-183 suggest that they were likely made at the monastery of Monte Cassino due to the Beneventan script. In the eleventh century, these illustrations were added to another manuscript of medical texts also created in the ninth century at Monte Cassino. 28 Florence, Laurenziana, MS 74.7, fols. 233r and 200r, tenth or eleventh century, Constantinople?). 29 Savage-Smith, \"Medicine in Medieval Islam,\" 148. 30 The largest numbers of materia medica illustrations during the pre-Salernitan period travel with a collection of texts associated with the Herbarium by ps.-Apuleius and will be discussed in more detail in chapter 2. A few illustrated manuscripts with at least part of Dioscorides's De materia medica (first century CE) survive in both Latin and Greek and some Latin texts derived from same work appear with illustrations. The fetus in utero illustrations usually accompany Muscio's Gynaecia (fifth century CE), which is itself largely a Latin translation of Soranus of Ephesus's work in Greek, On Gynecology (second century CE). Illustrations of bandaging accompany another Soranus text, De fasciis, and those showing orthopedics travel with a Greek work by Apollonius of Citium, Dislocations (first century BCE). Only cautery images maintained the unusual position of traveling independent of a textual support. Latin surgical texts, however, survive from the period. Before the eleventh century there were at least two surgical texts circulating in the West and usually in abstracted forms: the Chirurgie Eliodori (The Surgery of Heliodorus, who was known as a surgeon during the time of Trajan) is found in Paris, BnF, lat. 11219 (ninth or tenth century) along with a section from Aulus Cornelius Celsus's (d. 50 C.E.) De medicina, called Chirurgie. Both texts include cautery procedures as therapeutic options for certain kinds of disease, however neither presents an independent section on cautery. Henry lat. 7028, fols. 170r-177v (eleventh century, Italy), contains an text focused on cautery, the Liber cyrurgie Ypocratis (Hippocrates' Book on Surgery). The text opens with a definition of surgery taken from De medicina (On Medicine) by Celsus. The remaining text (not associated with Celsus) includes 12 widely depending on whether the text was written in Latin, Greek or Arabic. Ancient Greek medical texts containing both practical medicine and medical theory continued to circulate in the Eastern Roman Empire during the Early Middle Ages. While by the ninth century Islamic scholars had access to Arabic translations, by contrast, very few Greek medical texts at this time had been translated into Latin. The few Latin translations we do find are mostly limited to knowledge of a practical nature, and western scholars tended to abstract, shorten, and re-arrange these texts, often without identifying an author (or sometimes even inventing one).31 In addition, many Latin medical texts also include accretions of medical recipes using local herbs, traditional charms, and prayers, many linked to ancient Roman medical traditions.32 In terms of theory, only short extracts on the four humours appear in Latin-based medical manuscripts, likely due to their resonance with the Christian worldview. Early Christian scholars valued the numerical connections between the four humours and the tradition of the four Gospels, as well as the holistic and harmonious vision of the universe on which the descriptions of the placement of cautery irons on the body as well as specifications on the type of iron to be used. Most important, the text is arranged in such a way as to leave space for illustrations within the text column. These illustrations are, however, missing. For a transcription and translation of the text, see Daniel de Moulin, De heelkunde in de vroege middeleeuwen (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1964), 93-104. No further copies of this text exist. 31 For various accounts of the abstraction process of medical texts in the Early Middle Ages, see Florence Eliza Glaze, \"The Perforated Wall: The Ownership and Circulation of Medical Books in Medieval Europe, ca. 800-1200,\" Ph.D. Dissertation, Duke University, 1999, 15-18; Faith Wallis, \"The Experience of the Book: Manuscripts, Texts, and the Role of Epistemology in Early Medieval Medicine,\" in Knowledge and the Scholarly Medical Traditions, ed. Don Bates (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1995), 101-126; and Gerard Baader, \"Early Medieval Latin Adaptations of Byzantine Medicine in Western Europe,\" Symposium on Byzantine Medicine, Dumbarton Oaks Papers, 38 (1984): 251-259. 32 Peregrine Horden, \"What's Wrong with Medieval Medicine,\" Social History of Medicine 2003); and Daniel Amundsen, Medicine, Society and Faith in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996). 13 theory is based. Schematic representations of the four humours that do exist from this period, however, are not generally found along with medical texts (fig. 6).33 In addition to traveling with a related text, pre-Salernitan medical illustrations are usually found in manuscripts that largely comprise collections of medical works.34 There is, however, wide variation in the types of texts and images and their ordering within\u2014no two manuscripts are the same. The incipits of the texts and inscriptions in the illustrations also vary widely, as do the compositions of the page. While some of this variety is probably due to access to materials, it may also be the result of intentional scribal and artistic choices based on pedagogical or ideological needs. Any conclusions must be based on the careful analysis of particular manuscripts, their compilers, artists, scribes, and intended audiences. By and large, the compilers, artists, scribes and audiences for illustrated Western manuscripts during the pre-Salernitan period were monks.35 It was only after the thirteenth century and the increasing professionalization of doctors that the production and use of 33 Laon, Biblioth\u00e8que Municipal, Ms 423, fol. 12r. (eighth century, Laon). Here the illustration accompanies Isidore of Seville's, De natura rerum (On the Nature of Things), a book of astronomy and natural history. The manuscript in which it is found also contains religious texts. 34 The one exception is illustrated medical prognostics, which are rarely found in medical manuscripts. Liuzza, \"The Sphere of Life and Death,\" 34. The Sphere of Life and Death usually appears among computistical materials, or those materials related to the calendar. 35 There is no evidence for the production of illustrated medical manuscripts in the Early Middle Ages by laypeople, although there is brief evidence that they owned them. It is certainly possible that laymen or medical practitioners made or acted as patrons of illustrated medical treatises during this period and it is due to the more stable situations of monasteries that only their copies exist. For the transmission of medical texts via monasteries, see Glaze, \"The Perforated Wall.\" For more on early book exchange between monasteries, see Rosamund McKitterick, The Carolingians and the Written Word (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989) and \"Exchanges between the British Isles and the Continent, c.450-c.900,\" in The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, volume I, c. 400-1100, ed. Richard Gameson (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), 313-337; and Richard Gameson, \"The Circulation of Books between England and the Continent, c.871-c.1100,\" in The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, 344-372. 14 medical manuscripts became a predominantly lay enterprise. Monasteries possessed trained and experienced scribes and artists as well the materials and knowledge to create such manuscripts in their scriptoria. As early library catalogues document, the finished products were maintained in their own libraries and largely transmitted within monastic networks of exchange. At the same time, medical books were not mere shelf copies meant to preserve ancient knowledge. The influential monastic founder Cassiodorus (ca. 485- ca. 585) specifically names medical texts as important material for monastic reading--perhaps signaling a spiritual component to the understanding of medicine.36 There is also ample evidence that monks practiced as doctors and gave medical advice within their communities and beyond. The most widespread monastic rule of the early medieval period, that of St. Benedict, prescribes the monks' care for the sick as a moral imperative, for it is in them that Christ is to be found.37 Medical knowledge within the early medieval monastery therefore served two functions: it was part of the spiritual and moral formation of the individual monks as well as serving a practical need for the community and its neighbors. Monasteries in the pre-Salernitan period were thus places of care and convalescence, centers for knowledge about medicine, and the focal points for the transmission of medical texts and illustrations. 36 Institutiones divinarum et saecularium lectionum, I, 31. 37 Rule of Benedict: Chapter 36. For more on the provisions regarding medical care in the Rule of St. Benedict, see Maria A. D'Aronco \"The Benedictine Rule and the Care of the Sick: The Plan of St. Gall and Anglo-Saxon England,\" in The Medieval Hospital and Medical Practice, ed. Barbara S. Bowers (London: Routledge, 2016), 235-251. She claims that the Rule's \"attention for the sick was in fact the inspiration behind an entire series of provisions that transformed Benedictine monasteries into some of the most important centers driving progress in medical science...and the most important centers where medicine was studied and practiced.\" Ibid., 235-6. 15 Medical Illustrations in the Twelfth Century Beginning in the late eleventh century, the Western medical canon began to change. In the region of Salerno, Italy--a region already noted for the training of medical doctors in the Early Middle Ages--and more specifically in the monastery of Monte Cassino, medical texts new to the Latin West were translated from Greek and Arabic.38 These texts provided Western Europe with a more comprehensive and better organized presentation of practical medicine as well as a thorough explanation of medical theory, particularly that associated with Hippocrates and Galen.39 Evidence from monastic library catalogues documents that 38 For more on this process, see Green, \"Medical Books,\" 279-290. Green outlines a three-stage development of medical books in the long twelfth century. The earliest efforts, she argues, began in the monasteries of Monte Cassino (Italy) and St. Gall (Switzerland), and comprised the recovery and renewal of Late Antique medical texts in Latin. In the second phase, Monte Cassino became a center for the translation of Greek and Arabic medical texts and their transmission throughout Western Europe. Finally, in stage three (during the later twelfth and thirteenth centuries), these theoretically based medical books began to be used in scholastic education. 39 The theory referred to here is a more expansive and complex form of humoralism based on Hippocratic/Galenic (129-ca. 216 CE) works as mediated by Arabic authors. Beginning in ancient Greece, medical philosophers developed several theories on the nature of health, the causation of disease, and cure. By the time of Galen of Pergamum (c. 129-c. 216 CE), and with his strong promotion, only one of the ancient approaches to medicine dominated--the theory of the four humours, a philosophy that was originally associated with Hippocrates and was founded on ideas about the nature of the world. The theory of the four humours held that the universe was composed of four qualities (hot, cold, wet and dry) which pair is various combinations to form four elements: fire, air, earth, and water that were linked numerically (and later physiologically) to four biological liquids, or humours: blood, phlegm, and black and yellow bile. Each person has a unique combination of humors that determines their physical and psychological attributes and health is defined by the equilibrium of an individual's humours. An unstable imbalance in the humours was synonymous with disease and could be affected by worldly conditions. Disease (or an imbalance in the humours) was believed to be caused either by congential defects, trauma or by \"non-naturals\" such as ambient air, food and drink, exercise and rest, sleep and wakefulness, excretion and retention, and the passions of the soul. While generally discussed in ancient Greek medical literature and in Galen's works, the theory of the non-naturals becomes formalized in medieval Arabic medical treatises. The practices of medicine were to facilitate the return to humoral balance via either diet, drugs, or their manual purgation through methods including the various procedures of surgery. Faith Wallis, \"The Ghost in the Articella: A Twelfth-Century Commentary on the Constantinian Liber Graduum,\" in Herbs and Healers form the Ancient Mediterranean through the Medieval West: Essays in Honor of John M. Riddle, eds. Anne Van Arsdall and Timothy Graham (Farnham, Surry England & Burlington VT: Ashgate, 2012), 107-151, 112-113. 16 these texts were quickly transmitted to monasteries in northern Europe where, along with the older medical texts, they began to quickly proliferate.40 While monasteries were clearly interested in medical works, at the same time, new entities were beginning to form, groups of cleric/scholars that would later coalesce into universities, that took an interest in medicine and incorporated the new ideas into their own works.41 The effect of the resurgence of medicine in the West on the production of medical illustrations, however, is not so clear. Of the new translations that survive, none include illustrations of medical practice, although three do provide author portraits, possibly of Constantine the African, the major translator of Arabic works into Latin (figs. 23-25).42 At the same time, the production of medical images associated with the older Latin works increases. Not only do we find more surviving images but also more variety in the way scenes are depicted and in the contexts in which they are employed. To take some examples, the tradition of materia medica illustrations continued, but the pictures were increasingly luxurious and began to include depictions of patients and caregivers (fig. 26).43 There are also 40 For more on the transmission of medical texts during the twelfth century, see Glaze, \"The Perforated Wall,\" 187-261. 41 For example, see Italo Ronca, Influence of the Pantegni on William of Conches's Dragmaticon,\" in Constantine the African, 266-285.

Collins, Medieval Herbals, does not mention any surviving illustrated herbals in Greek or Arabic during this period. 17 more surviving images of fetuses in utero,44 and more figural images related to prognostic texts.45 More diversity appears with respect to the depiction of medical authorities in Western manuscripts; in addition to the traditional enthroned or clypeus illustrations, we now find images of medical authorities engaged in the practice of medicine (fig. 27), in teaching (fig. 28), and in debate with other doctor/scholars (fig. 29)\u2014and these authorities are not only the traditional ancient authors but contemporary ones as well.46 The earliest surviving portraits of medical authorities also appear in late twelfth-century Arabic medical manuscripts (fig. 30).47 The most striking illustrative changes, however, emerge in the areas of surgery and anatomy.48 As these illustrations feature prominently in the manuscripts discussed in the 44 Copenhagen, Kongelige Bibliothek, MS Thott 190 (late twelfth century). For more on these images, see Borland, \"Unstable Women,\" 200-238. Images of pregnant women survive from the thirteenth century. 45 See for example, The Tiberius Psalter, London, BL, Cotton MS Tiberius C VI, fol. 6v (Sphere of Life and Death, late eleventh-mid twelfth century); and London, BL, Harley MS 3667, fol. 4v (twelfth century, Peterborough Abbey). There are also depictions of the medical prognosis of Life or Death by the Caladrius bird in other manuscripts including Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 22, fol. 166 (1150-1170, N. England). If the bird looks at the patient, he or she will recover and if not, death is imminent. 46 An ancient doctor helping to prepare medicines in Berlin, Staatsbibliothek, MS lat. qu. 198, fol. 2v (1132, N. Spain or S. France, \"Berlin, MS 198\"); a seated Ypocras (Hippocrates) teaches a young doctor how to perform cautery procedures by means of codex in Galen, and an unidentified scholar in discussion in Berlin, MS 198, fol. 10v.

The earliest surgical work that appeared during the long twelfth century was part of an Arabic medical treatise that had been translated by Constantine the African in the late eleventh century, the Pantegni (The Whole Art). It is found in Book IX of the Practica section. For more on the Pantegni and Constantine the African, see the many articles in Constantine the African and 'Al Ibn al-'Abbs al-Mags: The Pantegni and Related Texts, eds. Danielle Jacquart (Leiden and New York: Brill, 1994). Constantine also translated a Galenic work, the Megategni, which included surgery. For more on this work, see Monica Green, \"Gloriosissimus Galienus: Galen and Galenic 18 chapters that follow, they bear a closer look. The earliest extant depictions of anatomy (known as the \"Five-\" or \"Nine\" Picture Series) (Table 1) survive in two Latin manuscripts, both of which contain a new text attributed to Galen.49 One set depicts the earliest extant images of the five full-body vascular systems, while the later also includes selected images of internal organs.50 As for surgical illustrations, the earliest surviving depictions of surgery Writings in the Eleventh- and Twelfth-Century Latin West,\" in Brill's Companion to the Bouras-Vallianatos and Barbara Zipser (Leiden: Brill, 2019), 319-342. The three other surgical texts were created in Italy, written in Latin, and were primarily practical. These include the Chirurgia Salernitana (The Salernitan Surgery), the earliest copy of which is found in Oxford, Corpus Christi College, MS 189, fols. 77v-78v (twelfth century, England); a surgical text now called the Bamberg Surgery from the mid-twelfth century; and Chirurgia (Surgery) by Roger Frugardi. A copy of the Roger's work was translated into Anglo-Norman and illustrated in the thirteenth century (Cambridge, Trinity College, MS O.1.20).

The ps.-Galen text that traveled with the new anatomical illustrations, the Historia incisionis, is a summary of Galen's many writings on anatomy. The other anatomical text that appears in the late eleventh century is found in Constantine's Pantegni and does not include illustrations. Note that by the ninth century, Galen's work, On Anatomical Procedures, as well as more specific anatomical texts, had been translated into Arabic; the earliest surviving anatomical illustrations are found in Mansr ibn Muhammad ibn Ilys's work on anatomy from the fifteenth century. Some thirteenth-century anatomical depictions created in southern France include certain features that appear only in the later Arabic and Persian collections. Some scholars have therefore surmised that these were copied from an earlier Arabic or Persian tradition. For a discussion and bibliography see McCall, \"Illuminating the Interior,\" 128-132. 50 One example of diagrams of the eye appears in a late twelfth century manuscript of Hunayn ibn Ishq's Ten Treatises on the Eye (Kitb al-'Ashr maqlt fi al-'ayn) described by Savage-Smith, \"Anatomical Illustration in Arabic Manuscripts,\" 151, Unfortunately, he does not provide its shelfmark. 19 using a knife are found in a Latin manuscript dating from the middle of the twelfth century.51 At the same time, the number of illustrated cautery procedures increase. While only one such series survives from the ninth century, there are seven examples to be found in the twelfth, characterized by a great deal of variability in their depictions and the selection of procedures (Table 2). Some show only patients, while others depict a doctor in every scene, and the appearances of all the figures varies by manuscript. While one series reproduces only six procedures, another depicts thirty. One set of cautery illustrations lacks identifying inscriptions, while another set not only provides specific descriptions for the placement of surgical tools but also biographies of the doctors performing the procedures.52 In addition, all of the surgical and anatomical illustrations just described appear in a diversity of manuscript contexts. Some books contain mostly medical works, but the kinds of texts and their order continue to vary widely. In other cases, almost no medical texts are included in manuscripts containing medical images. For example, one series of cautery illustrations is found in a manuscript containing mostly computus texts, another in a book of glossaries and biblical commentaries.53 At the very least, we can conclude from the surviving record that medical 51 There are no surviving surgical illustrations in the Greek tradition from the twelfth century. In the Arabic tradition, schematic drawings of surgical instruments are mentioned in the tenth-century treatise, Kitb al-tasrf 404/ (Bihar), India, Khuda Bakhsh O.P. Library, Bankipore MS 17. For more on the Arabic illustrated manuscripts of Albucasis's work, see Sami Khalaf Hamarneh, \"Drawings and Pharmacy in Al-Zahrawi's 10th-Century Surgical Treatise,\" United States National Museum Bulletin 228 (1961): 81-94, now available online via Project Gutenberg, https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26038. Gerard of Cremona translated this work in the late twelfth century as the Liber Alsaharavi de cirurgia, and by the early thirteenth century there is at least one illustrated copy, Florence, Laurenziana, MS Plut. 73.23 (1201-1210). Oddly, this manuscript also includes some figural depictions of patients receiving cautery treatments in the margins of the page. These were likely added to the manuscript by an artist familiar with Western cautery illustrations. 52 For a comparison of two of sets of cautery procedures with the most similarities, see Appendix A. 53 Durham, Durham Cathedral Library, Hunter 100; and Munich, BSB, Clm 13002, respectively. 20 illustrations were primarily a Western phenomenon during the twelfth century, there was no consistent series of medical images, and that this diversity was most evident in illustrations that showed human bodies (including depictions of medical authorities, surgery, and cautery).

Albucasis treatise on surgery, translated by Gerard of Cremona (liber cyrurgie) Scholarly Assessment Modern historians have only just begun to appreciate the diversity of twelfth-century medical illustrations. In general, those aspects of the images that align with medical texts have been considered by historians of science, while the biblical and mythological features have been discussed by other scholars in their respective fields. This separate treatment has resulted in distorted or inadequate conclusions about the nature and meaning of medieval medical images. Historians of medicine have been wary of discussing scientific illustrations as cultural products, assuming instead their unmediated ability to portray historical medical knowledge and practice.65 Art historians have amply discussed depictions of healing as they relate to religion or mythology, while illustrations of specific medical treatments have largely been ignored because of their \"secular\" status and apparently limited hermeneutic potential. A closer look at the historiography of medieval medical images draws out these points. 64 Jones, Medieval Medicine in Illuminated Manuscripts, 123. Donatella Lippi, 'Consilioque manuque:' Surgery Medicea Laurenziana (Florence: Mandragora, 2011), 64, dates the manuscript to late thirteenth early fourteenth century. 65 Sander L. Gilman, Health and Illness: Images of Difference (London: Reaktion Books, 1995) also publ. as Picturing Health and Illness: Images of Identity and Difference (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1995). Gilman summarizes and updates his argument on the (too) cautious approach of medical historians to images in \"Representing Health and Illness: Thoughts for the Twenty-First Century,\" Medical History 55 (2011): 295-300. Gilman's position is partially belied by the recent works of Monica Green. See for example, Green, \"Medical Books,\" esp. 284-286; and eadem, \"Moving from Philology to Social History: The Circulation and Uses of Albucasis's Latin Surgery in the Middle Ages,\" in Between Text and Patient: The Medical Enterprise in Medieval and Early Modern Europe, eds. Florence E. Glaze and B. Nance (Florence: SISMEL, Edizioni del Galluzzo, 2011), 331-372, esp. 350-356. 24 Interest in medieval medical illustrations began in earnest around the turn of the twentieth century within the emerging discipline of the history of medicine. The German historian Karl Sudhoff (1853-1938), regarded as a pioneer in the field, published anthologies of surgical and anatomical illustrations, while Henry Sigerist (1891-1957) focused on the materia medica traditions.66 Their scholarship and that of their students resulted in the publication of numerous lists of surviving images, transcriptions of associated texts, and descriptions and copies of many illustrations. These works were the first to document the proliferation and variety of medical images from the twelfth century. Sudhoff emphasized the importance of these illustrations for the history of medicine. He argued that rather than being mere subsidiaries of a medical text, such images provide historical evidence of actual medical knowledge and practice.67 Sudhoff also emphasized the use of medical images during the Middle Ages within a pedagogical context. He argued that they both functioned as teaching aids and served to transmit ancient medical knowledge to practitioners. He also hypothesized that medical illustrations found in medieval manuscripts were based on models that first emerged in the Hellenistic medical schools of Alexandria and that the medieval copyists closely followed these models in order to accurately preserve ancient knowledge. 66 Of particular importance are his anthologies of anatomical and surgical images. Sudhoff, Ein 1914). 67 Sudhoff's view was largely based on the currently questionable conception of artistic ability. \"The fact that great artists, even the most idealistic and unworldly, possess this divine gift of vision, of unconsciously grasping what is real under all conditions...makes him an involuntary recorder of reality in his time.... [artists] completely reproduc[ed] the objects of our scientific research in anatomy, physiology and pathology.\" Sudhoff, \"Painting and the History of Medicine,\" in Essays in the History of Medicine, ed. Fielding H. Garrison, trans. Albert Allemann (New York: Medical Life Press, 1926), 313-317, 313-314. 25 Sudhoff's approach to medical illustrations contrasts with that of a roughly contemporary English scholar and doctor, Charles Singer (1876-1960).68 Like Sudhoff, Singer argued that medieval medical illustrations offer insight into the actual knowledge and practice of medicine in the period. But for him they demonstrated \"the wilting mind of the Dark Ages,\" and were symptomatic of the \"final pathological disintegration of the great system of Greek medical thought.\"69 Singer's grand narrative of medical progress and his insistence on an overarching teleological theory prevented him from valuing medieval images within their own cultural context. This contrasts with Sudhoff, whose placement of medieval medical images within the context of \"classical\" education was likely intended to counter earlier dismissive attitudes towards medicine in the \"dark ages.\" After a lull of about thirty years, twelfth-century medical illustrations again became the object of intensive research, resulting in several large compilations of images by scholars such as Loren MacKinney (1965), Pierre Huard and Mirko Grmek (1966) Robert Herrlinger (1970), John Murdoch (1984), and Peter Murray Jones (1984; revised 1998).70 In every case, 68 Singer was also part of the movement to establish the discipline of the history of medicine and was one of the founding members of the Department of the History and Philosophy of Science at University College London in the 1920s. 69 Singer, \"The Herbal in Antiquity,\" The Journal of Hellenic Studies 47.1 (1927): 1-52, 31; and John H. G. Grattan and Singer, Anglo-Saxon Magic and Medicine (London & New York: Oxford University Press, 1952), 94. For further discussion, see Linda E. Voigts, \"Anglo-Saxon Plant Remedies and the Anglo-Saxons,\" Isis 70.2 (1979): 250-268, 252. 70 MacKinney, Medical Illustrations in Medieval Manuscripts (London: Wellcome Historical Medical Library, 1965); Huard and Antiquity to A.D. 1600 (London: Pitman, 1970); Murdoch, Album of Science: Antiquity and the Middle Ages (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1984); and Jones, Medieval Medical Miniatures (London: British Library, 1984) revised in Medieval Medicine in Illuminated Manuscripts (London: British Library and Milan: Centro Tibaldi, 1998). The MacKinney Collection of medical illustrations is presently available online through the University of North Carolina at https://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/mackinney/. 26 these studies abstract medical images from their manuscript and cultural contexts and group them according to certain themes. MacKinney, for example, divides illustrations from the ninth to the fifteenth centuries by topics such as hospitals and clinics, diagnosis and prognosis, materia medica, pharmacy, and medication, while the broad concept of medieval chirurgie is further divided into cautery, bloodletting, surgery, orthopedics, and obstetrics. Sudhoff's claim of the Alexandrian origins of the images appears to have been widely accepted by these scholars, although their transmission to Western Europe did become a subject of debate.71 As in Sudhoff's work, the interpretive range of the illustrations is limited to their medical meaning, however this medical meaning is further enhanced by more detailed study of the iconography with reference to contemporary medical texts. MacKinney, for example, interprets a previously incomprehensible round object given to a patient in a twelfth-century cautery illustration as a soporific sponge that will help to deaden the pain of the procedure.72 No reference to a sponge appears on the page nor does any text within the manuscript refer to such a palliative measure. Rather, the identification is based on references to such a practice in the ancient textual tradition that continued into the Middle Ages.73 71 McCall, \"Illuminating the Interior,\" 37-42 summarizes the various positions: either by Arabic copies, exchange with Byzantium beginning in the ninth century, or by copies made in the context of the medical schools of Ravenna. 72 MacKinney, Medical Illustrations, 53. Others have interpreted the drinking cups that appear alongside some cautery patients as references to another type of anesthetic discussed in contemporaneous medical literature. See for example, Daniel de Moulin, \"A Historical-Phenomenological Study of Bodily Pain in Western Man,\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine, 48.4 (1974): 540-570, 557-8. 73 The medieval works that reference the soporific sponge are named by Plinio rejects the suggestion of its actual medical usage during the Middle Ages. 27 MacKinney does not, however, consider contemporaneous religious texts related to suffering and pain relief. More recently, historians of science have begun to reinterpret some of the iconographic motifs within medieval medical illustrations. In an article from 2007, Jones questions the assumption that medical illustrations only transmit medical knowledge and suggests possible religious references within them.74 For Jones, the same object that MacKinney interpreted medically as a soporific sponge is better explained by reference to a biblical text and the religious imagination of the monastic artist.75 Jones's insight takes into account the monastic context in which the image was produced, yet his evaluation of the biblical reference within a medical illustration is curious. For him, the possibility of such a religious allusion excludes any other potential meaning for the object, even a medical one. Jones believes that its insertion was a mistake due to an artist who likely did not understand the intended medical referent.76 With some recent exceptions, Jones's assessment is characteristic of the general approach to twelfth-century medical illustrations within the history of medicine.77 Such 74 Jones, \"Image, Word and Medicine in the Middle Ages,\" in Visualizing Medieval Medicine and Natural History, 1200-1550, eds. Jean A. Givens, Karen Reeds, and Alain Touwaide (Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2006) 1-24, 5. Jones also wants to incorporate healing images and amulets into the discussion of medieval medicine in order to combat potential anachronistic conceptions of medieval \"medicine.\" 75 Jones, \"Image, Word and Medicine,\" 5. Jones relates the object to the hot coal placed into the mouth of the prophet Isaiah and links it to the coals that would have been required to heat the cautery irons. 76 Ibid., 22. Indeed, while Jones claims to expand the understanding of the role of images within medieval medicine, he limits the expansion to their use in medical practice (particularly in surgery and anatomy), direct healing (such as amulets), and for professional display. 77 See for example, the work of Monica Green, \"Medical Books,\" esp. 284-286; eadem, \"Moving from Philology to Social History,\" esp. 350-356; Faith Wallis, \"Albums of Science in Twelfth-Century England,\" Peritia 28 (2017): 195-224. 28 illustrations are thought to denote unmediated representations of actual medical practices and knowledge. The notion that they are cultural products of their time and circumstances that reflect the ideas and needs of the producer and intended audience only arises when the images fail to meet scholarly expectations of what correct medicine is, in which case they are deemed mistakes. Indeed, the weakness of the history of medicine approach is that it has failed to fully appreciate the implications of the monastic, and thus religious, context in which these images were made and the function they served in the monks' education and formation. Considering the vast literature on monastic art and illustration in the discipline of art history, it is surprising that here too the assessment of medieval medical images has been limited at best. Georg Swarzenski (1876-1957) was one of the first art historians to examine twelfth-century medical illustrations, albeit in a cursory fashion, and specifically only those included in certain types of materia medica manuscripts. Like Sudhoff, he places the models upon which these images were thought to be based in Late Antique Alexandria.78 Most important for later art historical work, he categorizes medical images as a type of \"secular\" art - a category ostensibly less amenable to the kind of rigorous contextual analysis given to illustrations in manuscripts of religious texts of the same period. This categorization has influenced all later assessments of twelfth-century medical illustrations. As one of the foremost scholars of manuscript illustration in the twentieth century, Kurt Weitzmann (1904-1993), also considered the medical art of the twelfth century. Following Swarzenski's model, Weitzmann specifically placed medical illustrations 29 secular category that also included mathematical, astronomical, and literary manuscript illustrations. The focus of his work, however, was not on secular art per se, but rather on reconstructing the ancient originals on which these images were based.79 Whereas Sudhoff, Swarzenski and others were content to assume Alexandrian models for medieval medical copies, Weitzmann made the pursuit of the hypothetical and lost iconographic model the focus of his art historical study. To this end, Weitzmann developed a method for ascertaining the originals based on contemporary textual analysis\u2014a stemmatic method that determines what aspects of an image accorded with an ancient original and what would have been later additions. In order to integrate this text-based method into the study of illustrations, Weitzmann made various assumptions about images. Foremost, he insisted on models for illustrations\u2014that is, no image is purely an original act of imagination--although he did allow for certain \"inconsequential\" additions and changes to the model over the years of its transmission. He also assumed that the \"purest\" (i.e., most ancient) type of illustration closely follows and is subsidiary to a referent text. For medical images, the purest type is schematic in design, without scenic or decorative additions. The earliest surgical and anatomical images, for example, would only have included the diagrammatic body of a patient--for only these depictions would provide \"increased intelligibility of the text.\"80 All 79 Weitzmann, Illustrations in Roll and Codex: A Study of the Origin and Method of Text Illustration, Studies in Manuscript Illumination 2 (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1947; 2nd ed. 1970). His approach is based on the methods of textual criticism that were flourishing in scholarly circles at the time. 80 Weitzmann, Ancient Book Illumination (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1959), 23. For example, the purest surviving illustrations of cautery, he claims, are from the thirteenth or fourteenth century and in Pisa, University Library, MS 735. No doctors appear in the illustrations and all the patients are naked with little differentiation in physiognomy. For more on the Pisan manuscript, see Carlo Maccagni, di un Sudhoff, Beitrage Churgie, 98, who argues that the appearance of a doctor in surgical illustrations means it derives from the oldest models. 30 depictions of doctors, helpers, certain tools, or indications of space such as arches and columns are thus seen as later accretions. While Weitzmann's theory offers a more sophisticated understanding of artistic creativity than that of Sudhoff and other historians of science, his valuation of images as subservient to texts along with other aspects of his method have lately been challenged. Some have argued with his specific attributions of original/accretion; others have opposed his singular focus on reconstructing the \"original;\" and many still have rejected his valuation of later additions as inconsequential corruptions rather than being important in their own right.81 While many scholars have challenged Weitzmann in this manner with regard to his method of treating sacred illustrations, fewer have addressed his method toward those images labeled secular. Since Weitzmann's early encounters with twelfth-century medical illustrations, their assessment within the discipline of art history has only sporadically arisen during the past fifty years. In the vast majority of cases, they have appeared within diachronic collections of similar types of medical illustrations82 or have been employed in collections focused on certain artistic styles or techniques.83 While these recent assessments provide more analysis of the artists and users, they still fail to offer a rigorous contextual analysis. Only rarely do 81 See for example, Grape-Albers, Sp\u00e4tntike Bilder aus der Welt des Bilder aus der Welt des Arztes. 83 Examples include Melanie Holcomb and Lisa Bessette, Pen and Parchment: Drawing in the Middle Ages (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2009); and Charles Reginald Dodwell, The Pictorial Arts of the West, 800-1200 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1993). 31 these studies consider the specific monastic circumstances of the production of medical illustrations or their context within a manuscript. Yet there are a few notable exceptions. In his analysis of the ninth-century Leofric Missal, Robert Deshman describes the medical prognostic illustrations placed within the missal as congruent with the religious nature of the liturgical manuscript itself.84 For Deshman, the depiction of the formerly secular late-antique medical image of \"Life\" takes on the iconography of Christ. Deshman highlights this point by referring to similar prognostic illustrations in the twelfth-century Tiberius Psalter. In the latter case, \"Life\" has a cross nimbus and stands upon \"Death\"--a position that likens Death to Satan. Deshman's interpretation makes sense within the monastic contexts in which these illustrations were made and the liturgical contexts in which the manuscripts were used. In another exceptional case, Elizabeth Klemm and Adam Cohen, in separate essays, reinterpret the function of surgical and anatomical illustrations within a manuscript from Pr\u00fcfening, Germany.85 Klemm focuses on their role, understood allegorically, in the spiritual formation of monks, while Cohen integrates the research of Mary Carruthers on the function of images in monastic meditatio. Carruthers describes meditatio as the cognitive process by which monks infused images with associative meaning, emphasizing the interrelationships between multiple, of Life and Death,\" 37-38, takes the argument further by claiming that the prognostic images not only have a religious meaning but also the table itself also had a religious function, that is, aiding clerics in the determination of time to give final unction. 85 Klemm, \"Die Regensburger Reichert, 1980), 1: 60-64; and Cohen, in a Medieval Miscellany,\" Gesta 48.2 (2009): 135-152. 32 sometimes conflicting ideas, and thereby generating new learning and further spiritual progress.86 In this way, Cohen links the medical illustrations to both monastic education and spirituality. While the analyses of Deshman, Klemm, and Cohen are vital for the understanding the religious use of medical images in a twelfth-century monastic context, they do not consider the potential medical meanings of the images. Other recent scholars have more explicitly addressed the convergence of secular and sacred iconography. Madeline Caviness and Bianca K\u00fchnel show how the graphical qualities of scientific illustrations were intentionally used in religious images made by monks to represent a theory of natural philosophy congruent with the harmonious Christian universe.87 More specific to the twelfth-century, other scholars have noted the complex visual strategies used in images that belie a secular/sacred binary. Faith Wallis describes how artists added \"graphic\" glosses such as columns and other decorative features to computational texts in order to produce a transcendental, theological effect;88 and Walter Cahn has noted examples of monastic religious illustrations that were meant to be considered literally and mathematically rather than allegorically.89 In these ways, scholars have begun to break down 86 Mary J. Carruthers, The Craft of Thought: Meditation, Rhetoric, and the Making of Images, 400-1200 (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1998), esp. Ch. 2, 60-115. 87 Caviness, \"Images of Divine Order and the Third Mode of Seeing,\" Gesta 22.2 (1983): 99-120; and K\u00fchnel, The End of Time in the Order of Things: Science and Eschatology in Early Medieval Art (Regensburg: Schnell & Steiner, 2003). 88 Wallis, \"Visualizing Knowledge in Medieval Calendar Science: A Twelfth-Century Family of 'Graphic Glosses' on Bede's De temporum ratione\" in The Visualization of Knowledge in Medieval and Early Modern Europe, eds.

Chajes (Turnhout: Brepols, 2020), 291-326. 89 Not only was there a new interest in approaching religious texts from the historical, ad litteram (by the letter), perspective but the same approach also appears in illustrations. See for example, Robert of St. Victor's (d. 1173) illustrations of Ezekiel's vision of the heavenly temple. Walter Cahn, \"Architecture and Exegesis: Richard of St.-Victor's Ezekiel Commentary and its Illustrations,\" The 33 the binary categories of secular and sacred iconography and to expand and diversify the educational accomplishments of twelfth-century monasteries. While there is still much to be gained from the literal approach to medical images with their medical referents, much is also lost by limiting the interpretive framework to purely medical models, whether they be empirical, iconographical, or textual. Contemporary religious iconography of disease and suffering also bears consideration. Scholars such as Cynthia Hahn have noted the marked increase during the twelfth century of portrayals of Christ incarnate, particularly of his torture on the Cross, and there are similar contemporary images of the martyrdom of the saints.90 The connections that might be made with portrayals of painful medical procedures and suffering patients are obvious. In terms of textual models, medical historians themselves have long looked to selected medical texts unconnected to any illustrations to explain the medical iconography. It is necessary, however, to look beyond texts specifically about medicine for sources of inspiration. For example, what avenues of meaning might open up by interpreting illustrations of cautery procedures in light of Isidore of Seville's (d. 636 CE) suggestion, in his influential Etymologies, that the cautery iron has the ability to cure sin?91 Moreover, the twelfth century was rife with new theological insights about the body that could have informed figural medical illustrations.92 Contemporary theologians Art Bulletin 76.1 (1994): 53-68. For the literal interpretation of religious works, see Beryl Smalley, The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1989). 90 Cynthia J. Hahn, Portrayed on the Heart: Narrative Effect in Pictorial Lives of Saints from the Tenth through the Thirteenth Century, (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001). 91 Isidore of Seville, Etymologies, XX.16.8. 92 For an overall view, see Caroline Walker Bynum, \"Why All the Fuss about the Body? A Medievalist's Perspective,\" Critical Inquiry 22.1 (1995): 1-33. 34 extensively examined the nature of Christ's bodily incarnation and his real presence in the Eucharist.93 They also further refined the belief in a full bodily resurrection at the end of times.94 Many contemporary theological texts discuss the relationship between the body and the soul, and one even incorporates ideas and terminology from the newly translated medical texts.95 Twelfth-century notions of the \"body,\" \"disease,\" and \"cure\" were resonant with a wide range of other concepts beyond what we today consider strictly medical. The body was both the vehicle to God, good health, and final salvation, as well as the path to destruction, disease, and hell. Notwithstanding the well documented resurgence of interest in the human body during the twelfth century, modern scholarship has yet to fully investigate medical illustrations in light of these trends. Finally, while there is a need to better understand the meaning and function of twelfth-century medical illustrations in their wider cultural context, likewise their significance stands to be enhanced in relation to their placement within their manuscripts. Instead of the traditional stemmatic approach to texts, which judges a particular example in 93 In the Sentences, Peter Lombard (d. 1160) discussed the three main views on the Incarnation that were extensively debated in the twelfth century.

For the Eucharistic debates, see Gary Macy, The Theologies of the Eucharist in the Early Scholastic Period: A Study of the Salvific Function of the Sacrament according to the Theologians c. 1080-c. 1120 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984). 94 For more on the twelfth-century theology of full body resurrection, see Caroline Walker Bynum, The Resurrection of the Body in Western Christianity, 200-1336 (New York, Columbia University Press, 1995). 95 See for example, William of St.-Thierry (1085-1148 CE), De natura corporis et animae, in De la Nature du Corps et Michel Lemoine (Paris: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9dition \"Les Belles Lettres,\" 1988). 35 relation to an original or ideal type, many recent scholars have begun to consider individual manuscripts as historical objects worthy of study on their own terms.96 They argue that manuscripts are \"integrated systems of communications\" and that the order and placement of texts and images, the layout of the page, and all its other features work together to create meaning.97 Conversely, the significance of each individual image and text is also formed and shaped by placement in the manuscript, on the page, and the decorative features placed alongside. The fundamental insight is that compilers are \"authors\" too and intentionally create meaning. This approach is particularly useful for the kinds of manuscripts in which most twelfth-century medical images are found, namely miscellanies. Formerly considered encyclopedic compilations of like and available materials, medical miscellanies are beginning to be approached as intentionally designed manuscripts created for specific audiences.98 Indeed, Faith Wallis has recently called for a whole reassessment of their 96 Stephen G. Nichols and Siegfried Wenzel, eds. The Whole Book: Cultural Perspectives on the Medieval Miscellany (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1996). In many ways, this approach to manuscripts is not new. Scholars such as Robert Deshman and Adam Cohen approach manuscript illustrations by considering their placement and function within the whole work. 97 Claire Richter Sherman, Imaging Aristotle: Verbal and Visual Translations in Medieval France (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995), xxi. 98 For more on miscellanies, see Patrizia in England: Eleventh-Century Codices and the Early Norman Ones,\" in Form and Content of Instruction in Anglo-Saxon England in the Light of Contemporary Manuscript Evidence: Papers Presented at the International Conference, Udine, 6-8 April as instructional texts.

Margaret R. Schleissner (New York: Routledge, 1995), 3-16. 36 function.99 To understand the potential meaning and role of twelfth-century medical images, it is thus not only important to consider them within the visual, intellectual, and religious contexts in which they were made but also to understand their function within the manuscript itself. Scope and Summary of the Present Study The present study is offered as a contribution towards a more complete understanding of twelfth-century medical illustrations from the perspective of the monastic culture that produced and made use of them. It is based on a careful review and analysis of the medical images appearing in three manuscripts produced by monastic scriptoria in northern Europe during this period. While limited in scope, this approach allows for a more thorough investigation than would be possible from surveying a broader selection of images. In addition to employing traditional art historical methods related to formal analysis and source attribution, the focus on three books will make it possible to consider these twelfth-century medical images fully within their manuscript context and with consideration for the historical circumstances in which the manuscripts and images were produced. I have approached these images with no preconceptions about their potential function and significance, although I do assume that they are capable of conveying a variety of meanings, not just limited to the obvious practical medicine they portray. None of the manuscripts studied contains any of the recently translated medical texts originating from Salerno and Monte Cassino, but each takes account of the new medical ideas in a different way. 99 Wallis, \"Between Reading and Doing: The Case of Medieval Manuscript Books of Practical Medicine,\" in The Edinburgh History of Reading: Early Readers, ed. Mary Hammond (Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press, 2020), 115-159. 37 Chapter one focuses on a manuscript created in the scriptorium of the monastery at Durham, England, and specifically on the cautery illustrations on the final folios. While the codex contains textual excerpts on practical and theoretical medicine, a large portion of the texts relate to the computus, or the calculation of time. Other visual components include images of the zodiac and constellations as well as graphical schemata associated with computus. The book is small and highly decorated, indicating that it was intended for individual reading by an important person, perhaps, as some scholars have suggested, a bishop with close ties to the monastery. I demonstrate how the cautery images contain multiple levels of meaning, not just of medical import, including the \"therapy\" of monastic reform and conversion for an institution embroiled in a conflict with their non-monastic abbot and bishop. A second manuscript, the subject of chapter two, linked to a wealthy and politically connected monastery of the Meuse Valley (possibly the abbey of Stavelot), contains images of surgery, materia medica, and figures without clear identifications. The texts are ancient in date, largely medical, and even include prayers addressed to an earth goddess and to the herbs. By all accounts, the manuscript seems to be a practical book of ancient medicine; however, a closer look at the texts and illustrations reveals Christological motifs and arguments in addition to medical theory. I identify the unnamed figures and show how the manuscript illustrates not only cures for the body but also divine therapies for the soul. The final manuscript, analyzed in chapter three, is a product of the monastery of St. George in Pr\u00fcfening, Germany. It seems to have been created in two stages, the original section of 1158 consisting of a collection of texts, and an addition dating from 1165 comprising a series of illustrations. Among the latter are the earliest extant depictions of human anatomy, twenty-two illustrations of cautery procedures, a full-bodied microcosm, an 38 illustration of the virtues and vices, and a schematic map of Jerusalem. Generally considered an encyclopedic work, I show how the images and texts work together to produce a model for the health of Pr\u00fcfening's \"monastic body.\" Seen as a whole, the medical illustrations in these manuscripts provide much more than practical medical information. Not only are they infused with religious imagery but they also address medical theory, pedagogy, and political issues; they take positions on major theological debates concerning the nature and relationship of the body and soul and integrate the Neoplatonic cosmology popular during the period. The boundaries between the secular and the sacred, between the body and the soul, between the individual body and the body politic, and between pagan and Christian converge upon one another. Finally, we might say that these illustrations and the manuscripts that contain them offer\u2014 through the paradigm of bodily health\u2014a guide to the ultimate cure of salvation, both for the individual and the monastic community as a whole. The twelfth-century monks who were the recipients of the newly disseminated medical knowledge were not ignorant or ill-equipped to deal with these ideas; they just had a much broader understanding of medicine and the uses to which illustrations of its practices and theory could be put. 39 Chapter One A Body of Knowledge: Medicine, Macrocosm, and the Computus Durham, Durham Cathedral Library, MS Hunter 100100 1.1 Introduction Sometime during the early years of the twelfth century, monks from the recently reestablished Benedictine cathedral priory of Durham compiled a small codex that today survives as Durham Cathedral Library, MS Hunter 100 (\"Hunter 100\").101 Modern scholars have treated Hunter 100 as a collection of secular/scientific materials and more specifically as a type of computus manuscript, for a large portion contains numerous texts, diagrams, and illustrations related to the computus, the science of time reckoning.102 At the same time, Hunter 100 also contains medical materials, including three folios of illustrations depicting surgical cautery. These latter illustrations have largely been ignored, both in the literature surrounding Hunter 100 as well as in collections of medical illustrations, likely because the images do not provide the medical content that would make them functional. They are not accompanied by 100 I would like to thank the members of the Durham Working Group (hereinafter, \"DWG\") for their generosity in allowing me to access their materials in progress. This chapter has greatly benefitted from these materials as well as the day-long session entitled \"Time, Science, and the Body in the Anglo-Norman World: Durham Cathedral Library, MS Hunter 100 and Its Context,\" at the 2018 International Medieval Congress, University of Leeds. Hunter 100 is available online at https://iiif.durham.ac.uk/index.html?manifest=t1m2f75r801v&canvas=t1tr207tp882. 101 The manuscript has been catalogued in a number of sources including Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts in Microfiche Facsimile, vol. 14: Manuscripts of Durham, Ripon, and York, Alger Nicolaus Doane and David Rollason, eds. (Tempe, AZ: Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2007), 111-20; N.R. Ker, Catalogue of Manuscripts Containing Anglo-Saxon (Oxford: item 110, and Roger Aubrey Baskerville Mynors, Durham Cathedral Manuscripts to the End of the Twelfth Century (Oxford University Press, 1939), no. 57. 102 The scholarship on the computus is vast. For an overview of the subject, see Faith Wallis, \"Calendars and Time,\" in Oxford Medieval Bibliographies, available online at https://www-oxfordbibliographies-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/view/document/obo-9780195396584/obo-9780195396584-0130.xml; and Leofranc Holford-Strevens, The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005). 40 explanatory texts or even inscriptions that would identify the condition or the treatment performed. These images of cautery in Hunter 100, however, are essential to the intended function of the manuscript as a whole. In this chapter I will contribute to a fuller understanding of the cautery illustrations by placing them into several wider contexts: that of the manuscript and its larger program of illustrations; that of the wider genres of computus books as well as cautery illustrations; and that of the circumstances of the Durham Cathedral monastic community at the beginning of the twelfth century where Hunter 100 was produced. Rather than being a book primarily meant for practice or instruction (whether in computus or in medicine), the cautery illustrations indicate its use primarily for intellectual and spiritual contemplation. In particular, they offered the Durham monks a reflection on the history of their monastic reform, a \"diagnosis\" of their present state, and a prescription for \"healing\" their impaired condition. 1.2 The Contents, Structure, and Arrangement of Hunter 100 Hunter 100 is a small codex, measuring 170 x 120mm, and filled with delicate and finely wrought drawings. Indeed, its size and quantity of illustrations sets it apart from other surviving computus compilations, which are usually much larger and dominated by texts and geometric schemata in the form of diagrams and tables.103 Another contemporary Durham-created work, Glasgow, University Library, MS Hunter 85 (T.4.2) (\"Glasgow 85\") measures 286 x 190mm and contains only one illustration, an author portrait of the Venerable Bede.104 Oxford, St. John's College, MS 17 (ca. 1110, Thorney Abbey, \"St John's 17\") is much 103 Ibid., 201. 104 The portrait of the Venerable Bede is placed before his work, De natura rerum (fol. 35r). 41 larger, measuring 340 x 250mm and contains five figural illustrations. These include four and one illustration of a seated and crowned king in the middle of a rota (fol. 27v).105 By contrast, Hunter 100 depicts eight cautery patients, two doctors, two medical helpers, twelve zodiac figures, twenty-five illustrations of the constellations (not including several pages that are missing), five anthropomorphized planets, an author portrait, and a scene of violence between two adult males.106 The contents of Hunter 100 can be generally divided between those relating to medicine and those pertaining to time calculation. The medical materials include texts on the body, its relationship to the universe, and the materials required for its sustenance; a Latin-Old English herbal glossary; medical recipes; and the previously mentioned cautery illustrations. The computus materials include texts and tables related to the calculation of Easter; more general texts on time calculation and music; astronomical texts and images of the constellations; a liturgical calendar illustrated with the zodiac; other diagrams, and the remaining illustrations. 105 Wallis also describes a faintly sketched depiction of Libra Calendar & the Cloister: Oxford-St. John's College MS 17, available online, https://digital.library.mcgill.ca/ms-17/apparatus.php?page=MS17_Description. 106 The only computus manuscript comparable in terms of figural representation includes parts of London, Cotton MS Tiberius C I that were originally joined to Harley MS 3667 (together the \"Peterborough Computus,\" 1120-1135). The original manuscript is difficult to assess for both segments are likely fragments of an even larger manuscript. See N.R. Ker, \"Membra Disiecta,\" The British Museum Quarterly 12.4 (1938): 130-135, 132. Not only do the extant sections contain computus tables and diagrams but also, like Hunter 100, constellation illustrations, although very different in style. In addition, the manuscript includes a figural prognostic diagram of the Sphere of Life and Death, twelve faces representing the winds in rota form, and two rota diagrams that associate biblical figures with each zodiac sign as well other elements (fols. 5r-v). 42 Recently, Faith Wallis has reconceptualized a number of computus compilations as \"scientific albums,\" a term that she argues better fits the often wide-ranging \"snapshots\" of materials (i.e., abstracts rather than full texts) and multiple arrangements found within.107 According to Wallis, the choices of materials and their arrangements were intentional and meant for the scholarly pursuits and meditatio of a clerical, intellectual elite. As such, the manuscripts offer both scientific information and underlying themes that may be revealed by the associative and exegetical methods used by medieval monks and other religious readers. Scientific albums thus required patient study and reflection not only to understand the specific scientific contents but also to uncover underlying themes suggested by the choice of materials and their arrangement in the manuscripts. As part of the same study, Wallis comprehensively analyses the textual choices and arrangements of materials within Hunter 100. She finds mirrored medical texts; a three-part arrangement of subject material that leads the reader on an experiential journey from the body to the universe and back again; and thematic strains of intellectual mistakes and corrections; medical theory and practical cures; and an overall leitmotif of harmony. My analysis is greatly indebted to her comprehensive descriptions of the materials within the manuscript and will build on her thematic ideas; however, it will focus on the medical illustrations and their relationships to the texts and other images in the manuscript. I offer a different but complementary perspective on the structure of the manuscript that explains the relationships among the illustrations and texts. Finally, I argue that the medical illustrations-as the final materials in the manuscript--act as a coda for the work's themes, bringing them down from the heights of the universe to the ground of the monastery itself: its patterns of 107 Wallis, \"Albums of Science in Twelfth-Century England,\" Peritia 28 43 discord and \"disease\" and \"cure;\" and underlying all, a constant, prayerful hope for harmony. 1.2a The Four-part Construction of Hunter 100 From a codicological perspective, Hunter 100 is divided into four independent booklets, two containing primarily computus materials and another two with extracts from medical texts (Table 3).108 The number four is important for several reasons. Twelfth-century thought perceived the material and temporal world as essentially unified and harmonious. This idea was largely based on a mathematical notion of harmony in which the fundamental aspects of creation were based on the number four.1 Four elements make up all matter; four seasons establish a yearly cycle; four directions orient the world; and four humours animate the human body. Hunter 100 mentions this idea on folio 60r and further links the number four to Christianity. Paraphrasing Bede, the (four is perfect because of the four elements, and because of the four Gospels, or because of the [number of letters in the] word/name Deus). The importance of the number four will be discussed in more detail in chapter 2 and recurs throughout this study. Although subtle and implicit, the fourfold structure of Hunter 100 contributes to the manuscript's underlying theme of the harmonious nature of a divinely created universe. 108 Richard Gameson, The Manuscripts of Early Norman England (c. 1066-1130) (Oxford: Oxford University Press for the British Academy, 2000), Nos. 278-281, 86-97, first noticed the codicological independence of the four booklets. By codicological independence he means that each booklet (containing multiple quires) contains complete texts or images, that is, no texts or images span between booklets, whereas within the booklets, texts run between quires. See also Doane, Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts in Microfiche Facsimile, 111. 44 The current ordering of the booklets in the codex places the two computus sections first and the medical ones last; however, this was not originally the case (Table 3). Initially, one medical booklet was placed at the beginning of the manuscript and the other at the end. In effect, the two medical sections \"bookended\" the computus materials.109 The cautery illustrations, today and originally, appear at the end of the manuscript. In order to understand their meaning, it is important first to examine them in the wider context of the structural and illustrative program for Hunter 100 as a whole.110 My analysis, following the way a monastic reader would have encountered the manuscript, will begin with the first medical section and continue sequentially through the book. 109 This configuration is not unprecedented in scientific albums. Oxford, St. John's College MS 17, for example, also generally follows this order--two medical segments that bookend a computus section--although some prognostic texts are included in the central section. Wallis, \"Medicine in Medieval Computus Manuscripts,\" in Manuscript Sources of Medieval Medicine, ed. Margaret Schleissner (New York: Garland, 1995), 105-143. 110 Only one scholar has considered the illustrations in Hunter 100 as a whole. Anne Lawrence-Mathers, Manuscripts in Northumbria in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries (Woodbridge, UK: Brewer, 2003), 82-88, offers an in-depth assessment of the stylistic issues within the work, linking the many scribal and at least two artistic hands to other contemporary manuscripts made in the Durham scriptorium. Lawrence-Mathers also describes the illustrations in the manuscript as a kind of encyclopedia of illustrations, using many sources for the imagery and style of figuration.110 She also notes an unusual feature--the highly active bodily movements of some of the figures. While her assessment of the human figuration highlights important elements of the illustrations, Lawrence-Mathers does not discuss the features that link them together in a meaningful way. 45 Table 3 Durham Cathedral Library Hunter 100, Original Order* Booklets Current Quire Numeration Current Folio the Hexaemeron fol. 101v Rabbanus: text on the virtues of mustard seed from Rabanus Maurus, Commentary on Luke (at least one missing folio) Booklet 2 Quire 1(10): Lacks Ysidorus dicit: Includes names of the months, seven days, and ten plagues; and a computus table addressing the months and days fols. 2r-7v Calendar with illustrations of the Zodiac Quire hours of daylight across months of the year with names of zodiac; and below, on the harmony of the four elements, qualities and seasons fols. 17r-22v [no rubrics; large initial; letter to Bonifacius and Bonus (members of the Papal staff) on the date of Easter fols. 24v-27r Epistola dionisii exigui ad intervals with the monochord Micrologus and P.-Bede, De signis caeli with illustrations of heavenly bodies (one or two folios missing after f. 60) and planetary motion; also an anonymous tract on computus. 111 These numbers do not account for the missing pages. 46 Diagrams: Planetary evagations, a table of planetary intervals and their musical values, and a diagram of the phases of the moon.

It centers on the number four: the four humours that make up the human body and determine its health in relation to other temporally-based \"fours\"--the four seasons and four phases of human life.112 As these relationships establish, the bodily humours change based on the yearly seasons and the stages of life. In this way, the body both mirrors and participates in the ever-changing yet harmonious universe. Following the text on the four humours are three excerpts from Isidore of Seville's Etymologies. The Etymologies was one of the most widely known textbooks in the Middle 112 The abstract has been linked to Vindicianus's letter to his nephew Pentadius, likely from the fourth century. Wallis, \"Albums of Science,\" 203. 47 Ages and an important source for medical knowledge.113 The first makes additional quaternary associations, connecting the four humours to the four material elements (fire, air, water, and earth) that make up the harmonious universe. It also offers an expansive definition of medicine (fol. 85r). Ad servatur To medicine belong not only things practiced by the skill of those properly called physicians but also matters of food and drink, clothing and shelter. Ultimately, it consists of every defense and fortification by means of which our body is preserved [healthy] in the face of external blows and accidents.114 In addition, the text postulates an equally expansive idea of the knowledge base required for doctors (fol. 90r). Queritur a people ask why the art of medicine is not included in the other liberal disciplines. It is for this reason: the liberal disciplines treat individual topics, but medicine treats the topics of all.115 113 For Isidore's influence in England, see M.L. Cameron, \"The Sources of Medical Knowledge in Anglo-Saxon England,\" Anglo-Saxon England 11 (1983): 135-155, 142. 114 My transcription.

The texts also present a broad definition of illness (morbis), which is described as all the sufferings of the body (omnes passiones corporis). Disease is caused by the four humours when they increase beyond their natural course (dum enim amplius extra cursum naturae creverint) (fol. 85v). Treatment between health and illness (inter sanitatem autem et morbum media est curatio), and proper treatment as that course of action that fits the disease and brings health (quae nisi abstracts that follow these texts are descriptive and definitional, naming the various types of disease (Book 4), the parts of the body (Book 11), and the plants that sustain, nourish, and cure it (Book 17).116 The next text is an excerpt from Ambrose of Milan's Hexameron, a commentary on the six days of divine creation. The passage from Ambrose's Hexameron discusses the third day of Creation on which God formed plants. As Ambrose notes, some plants have ambiguous natures, with the ability to both harm and heal the body Science,\" 205, calls them \"medicinal\" plants, but I prefer to think of them as preventative medicine, or rather those divinely created plants intended to maintain and nourish the body rather than for healing acute disease. Rubrics for the extracts include: de holeribus (on vegetables/ herbs) and De holeribus odoratis (on aromatic vegetables/ herbs). 117 The rubric introducing the passage also emphasizes this interpretation: De medicaminibus herbarum ambrosius dicit quid vel ubi proficient (On medicines made from herbs, Ambrose says what and where they are effective) operator Found growing among other plants that help sustain life are hellebore and monk's hood, which too often delude and deceive the gatherer. But would you find fault with the earth because not all men are good? What is of more consequence, you should realize that not all the angels of heaven were good...And it has not escaped our notice that the ravings of the sensual passions frequently have been stayed by hemlock and that with hellebore the prolonged suffering of a sick body has found relief. The Creator, therefore, is not liable to blame in these matters; actually, His bounty is increased thereby, inasmuch as what you believed was created to bring danger to you is designed to bring to you life-giving remedies.118 This passage is notable for at least two reasons. First, Ambrose's definition of illness--which in Isidore includes all sufferings of the body-- pointedly includes moral sickness, for hemlock is said to cure lust. Second, it emphasizes the ambiguous nature of some plants. While hemlock, the famous poison reputedly taken by Socrates on his deathbed, and hellebore are known to be fatal, they may also cure disease and alleviate pain. Ambrose goes on to state that while animals have the innate ability to discern which plants offer nourishment and healing, human beings do not. Rather, they are given reason (rationabilis) in order to discern the difference. The text continues by specifically naming medical science (ratione medicine) and doctors (medicinali) as having the requisite knowledge to employ dangerous plants in the course of a cure (fols. 118 My Translation by John J. Savage, in Saint Ambrose: Hexameron, Paradise, and Cain and Abel (New York: Fathers of the Church, 1961), 97 (Hexameron, 3.9.40). 50 The fact is that through medical science this plant [the hellebore] frequently serves to preserve the health of the human body, to which it seems to be adverse. As a consequence, what the doctor's hand converts to the preservation of our health becomes even to a greater degree, through its natural qualities, a means for providing food for others.119 Even more specifically, the text points to the agency of \"the doctor's hand\" (medicinali manu) as required to effect healing\u2014a theme that will return in the analysis of the cautery images below. The final text in the first medical booklet is an excerpt from Rabanus Maurus's Commentary on Luke, 30 (fol. 101v) and it is introduced solely by a rubric with his name.120 Due to a missing folio, his text cuts off in the middle of a sentence, but from what appears in the manuscript, it offers a remedy for the purification of the head (ad purgationem capitis). The complete sentence, as known from other sources, suggests that the treatment is for moral sickness (imbecillitatum), a weakness inherent to the nature of human beings.121 (In the passage below, the asterisks show where it has been cut off in Hunter 100 (fol. 101v); the rest is supplied from See also 110.302. Doane, Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts in Microfiche Facsimile, 119, also notes that the text could have been taken from Hrabanus' Commentarium in Matthaeum 5.17, PL 107.1003-4. 121 Wallis, \"Albums of Science,\" 205, notes that the Ambrosian text calls for hemlock to subdue lust, another moral sickness. 51 It is to be noted that a grain of the mustard seed is salubriously helpful for the purgation of the head, for if having crushed it finely and sifted it you should mix it with sweet tepid oil, and having fasted until the midday heat you should gargle it in a bath, then every [harmful] humour***, even if it was denser, is purged from the head and the danger of imminent weakness is avoided. The sentence in Rabanus's text that likely followed in the manuscript would have reinforced the moral diagnosis. Thus, undoubtedly, all faith is proven by the pestle of temptations, chastened from every superficiality of trivial thoughts by the sieve of discretion, and sweetened by the honey of perfect love; not only does [the faith of the mustard seed] draw away the filthy drain water of the vices from the heart (which is the head of our interior man), but it averts it in the future, lest they are able to be recalled.122 While it is impossible to know how much of the Rabanus text would have appeared on the following folio, there are other indications that the text referred to more than physical disease and offers a different form of curing agent. Indeed, the theological allusions of the mustard seed to the curing power of faith would have been obvious to the Durham monks. In Luke's gospel, Christ says, \"if you had faith like to a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this mulberry tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou transplanted into the sea: and it would obey you\" (17:6). The same parable in Matthew's gospel is placed in the context of an actual medical/moral cure.123 Christ ne recolligi valeant praecavet. 123 In the Gospel of Matthew, Christ says \"[f]or, amen I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove from hence hither, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.\" 52 reprimands his disciples \"of little faith\" who could not cure a \"lunatic\" who \"falleth often into the fire\" (17:14). Jesus performs the exorcism and the devil is cast out of the boy's body (17:17). It seems that faith, like the doctor's hand, holds the power to cure. In addition, other Gospel passages evoking the mustard seed provide a different gauge for determining health. In three of the Gospels, the perfection of the Kingdom of Heaven is compared to the nurtured growth of the mustard seed into a plant. \"[The Kingdom of God] is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds perched in its branches\" (Luke 13:18-19).124 The allusion to the mustard seed thus seems to suggest that the goal of a cure is more than physical health; it is also the nurturance of the Kingdom of God inside the human soul. In conclusion, the first medical section offers a theory of medical science and one that is embedded in Christian ideas of creation. The textual excerpts situate the body in the larger harmonious scheme of the divinely created universe and time; define sickness as both physical and moral suffering; and proffer two types of curing agents: the \"hand\" of a doctor who has gained universal knowledge and the \"plant\" of faith grown and nourished in the body. 1.2c The First Computus Booklet Wallis describes the science of time reckoning, known in medieval compilations as the computus, as a fundamentally Christian science. The core texts and tables found in medieval manuscripts were developed in order to calculate the date of Easter. Knowledge of its methods was both \"compulsory\" for clerics and also contained \"no pre-Christian cultural 124 See also Matthew: 13:31-32 and Mark 4:30-32. 53 baggage\" that might cause concern for a Christian elite.125 The first computus booklet in Hunter 100 contains the core tables used to determine Easter, texts that offer methods to calculate the year of the birth of Christ (annus domini), a liturgical calendar with dates for other religious celebrations, and further materials describing the harmonious physical and temporal world. Like the first medical booklet, this section expresses themes of divine creation, its complex changing harmonies, the specialized knowledge required to understand its workings, and the \"corrections\" required to get it right. Because Wallis's analysis provides a detailed review of the textual components of this section, here I will only recount those details important for the assessment of the illustrations and the overall thematic program of the manuscript. The first computus section opens with a folio containing short texts on temporal matters, including works on the names of the months, the seven days of the week, and the ten plagues named in Exodus (fols. 1r-v). Wallis suggests that these materials not only focused on the solar calendar \"with its structure of seven-day weeks\" but by referencing Exodus foreshadowed the Paschal tables and its connection to Passover.126 A twelve-folio liturgical calendar with the first figural illustrations in the manuscript follows these texts (fols. 2r-7v). The Hunter 100 calendar follows a traditional layout with one month per folio. Columns on the left contain letter and Roman numeral entries that link to later tables. Roman numerals, based on the system of kalends and placed to the left of the associated abbreviation KL, vertically list the dates of each month. Texts to the right of many of these Roman numerals name important liturgical feasts, astronomical events, and computistical dates. Other 125 Wallis, \"Albums of Science,\" 196. 126 Ibid., 208. 54 temporal matters are included in inscriptions at the top and bottom of the page. Finally, on the right side of each page at varying heights, the artists have placed an illustration of the zodiac sign related to the month.127 At present, there is no comprehensive study of illustrations in liturgical calendars.128 In general, scholars agree that the iconography of the zodiac figures in medieval calendars is comparable to that found in illustrated astronomical texts, namely that they too are based on ancient pagan illustrations.129 In Hunter 100, however, the Durham artists have chosen to present at least some of the figures with features that reflect Christian iconography and ideas. Virgo, traditionally depicted within constellation texts as a winged female holding a grain of wheat (spica, referring to the name of the bright star near her left hand) or a scale, here has iconographic features that liken her to the Virgin Mary (fig. 31).130 No wings appear and her 127 Ibid. 128 A beautifully illustrated book, but far from comprehensive is Teresa Perez Higuera, The Art of Time: Medieval Calendars and the Zodiac (London: Wiedenfeld & Nicholson, 1998). For general information on medieval liturgical calendars see Roger S. Wieck, The Medieval Calendar: Locating Time in the Middle Ages (New York: The Morgan Library & Museum in association with Scala Arts Publishers, 2017). 129 Eric Ram\u00edrez-Weaver, \"Coordinating Classical Traditions and Medieval Visions in the Star Pictures of Durham MS. Hunter 100,\" (forthcoming), 11. In another of his works, A Saving Science: Capturing the Heavens in Carolingian Manuscripts (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania University Press, 2017), Ram\u00edrez-Weaver offers an analysis of the development of Carolingian astronomical images, which became the basis of later Western illustrative traditions. 130 Ram\u00edrez-Weaver, Saving Science, 95. Some Carolingian models reinterpreted the classical tradition of a \"winged goddess of Justice\" in angelic form. For examples of the early tradition, see London, BL, Add. MS 15819, fol. 12r (fifteenth century, Germanicus text); St. Gall, Stiftsbibliothek, Cod. sang. 250, page 481 (ninth century, revised Aratus text, also holds a scale); Oxford, https://www.thesaxlproject.com/assets/Uploads/00-Virgo-Master-14-June-2019-Autosaved.pdf, only shows one other manuscript in which Virgo may represent the Virgin, Baltimore, Walters Art Gallery, Ms. W.734 (ca. 1200, Italy, France or Spain, Hyginus, Astronomica). Here she holds fleur-de-lis scepters in each hand. 55 cloak, with her head covered, is similar to earlier and contemporary depictions of Mary.131 In addition, in Hunter 100, the artist has positioned her next to a liturgical entry for the Assumption (Assumptio Sanctae Marie) and placed a fleur-de-lis scepter in her hands, perhaps reflecting her power as Queen of Heaven.132 Gemini, usually personified as male twins often in battle gear, are shown here as the female martyrs, Pudentiana and her sister Praxedes (fig. 32).133 The left hand of one points to their feast day, while the right hand of the other holds a palm leaf signifying their martyrdom.134 While Libra holds the traditional scales in his right hand, his other contains an unusually large branch (fig. 33). I have not been able 131 See for example, the Winchester Psalter, London, BL, Cotton MS Nero C. iv, fol. 8r (ca. 1150, Winchester). There is also evidence that contemporary illustrations of Virgo were often conflated with the Virgin Mary. In London, BL, Arundel MS 60, fol. 4r (fourth quarter eleventh century to the twelfth century, Winchester) Virgo appears standing, dressed in a hooded cloak, near the liturgical entry for the Assumption and directly under a small cross. I have not been able to identify the object in her left hand, but a similar object reappears in the calendar and held by the Gemini twins. The Virgo in the St. Albans Psalter, Hildesheim, Dombibliothek, MS St. Godehard 1, page 3 (twelfth century, St. Albans) bears wings and holds a sheaf of wheat, but her covered head is also surrounded by a halo. She too is placed alongside the feast day for the Assumption. It is also possible that the image may allude to Christina of Markyate, the holy woman for whom some argue the manuscript was made. For a similar image, but with Virgo holding a different object, see London, BL, Lansdowne MS 383, fol. 6v (second quarter, twelfth century, England). Others are less convincing. In London, BL, Cotton MS Julius A VI, fol. 7r (first half of the eleventh century, Canterbury?), Virgo is presented in a small roundel at the top of a calendar page. She is dressed in a similar hooded tunic, but she holds an undistinguishable plant and does not appear next to a Marian feast day. For more on the important role of Mary for English Benedictine monks during this period, see Kati Ihnat, Mother of Mercy, Bane of the Jews: Devotion to the Virgin Mary in Anglo-Norman England (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2016). 132 The Durham artists have placed a similar fleur-de-lis motif on the right shoe or sock of the zodiac Aquarius (fol. 2r). 133 For and illustration of Gemini as twin male warriors in a liturgical calendar, see the Winchester Psalter, London, BL, Cotton MS Nero C IV, fol. 42r (mid-twelfth century, Winchester). Other contemporary liturgical calendars depict them as twin males, but do not always include warrior gear. See for example, London, BL, Cotton MS Julius A VI, fol. 5v (first half of the eleventh century, Canterbury?) and London, BL, Arundel MS 60, fol. 4r (fourth quarter eleventh century to the twelfth century, Winchester). 134 \"Pudens, Pudentiana, Praexedes, Ss.\" in New Catholic Encyclopedia, 15 vols. (Detroit: Thomson Gale in association with the Catholic University of America, 2003), 11: 811. 56 to find a precedent for the branch, but it may refer to the True Cross--the liturgical entry for the Exaltis sanctae crucis, celebrating St. Helena's discovery of the Cross in Jerusalem, is placed immediately to the illustration's left. In more general terms, the animals that largely appear ferocious in other calendars and astronomical texts seem tame in Hunter 100. Most notably, the lion, Leo, usually appearing in profile running or jumping and often with his tongue out, is here facing forward and appears to kneel (fig. 34). Finally, the artist has unprecedently placed Taurus in such a way that the animal's horns point to the word \"paschalis\" as if he were to be the paschal sacrifice (fig. 35). The next folios contain the tables associated with the columns in the calendar (fols. 8r-13r) and another set of tables used to calculate Easter, those of Abbo of Fleury and the Ephemeridia (fols.13v-16r).135 Following these tables are two diagrams that reflect the harmony of the universe (fol. 16v). The first diagram shows the harmonious relationships between the zodiac signs, the solar months, and the hours of daylight in each month (fig. 36). As Wallis notes, the figures for the hours of daylight accurately account for the latitude on which Durham is located, thereby placing Durham within the originally created harmony.136 The second, a syzygia elementorum also on folio 16v, depicts the ordered correlations between the four seasons, the four elements, and the four qualities (fig. 37). An inscription below the diagram refers to the four humours and the four stages of the life cycle. Together, 135 Ibid. 208-9. Curiously, only one of the former tables is missing, the one showing position of the moon in the (here, Christianized) zodiac. Faith Wallis, \"Durham's 'Web of Science' at the Dawn of the Twelfth Century: Durham Cathedral Library MS Hunter 100 and its Context,\" (Slater Fellowship Lecture, University College, Durham University, May 1, 2015), 10. 136 Wallis, \"Durham's 'Web of Science',\" 11. 57 they join time, the universe, and the body in a harmonious union.137 Both are created using symmetrical concentric circles and regular interweaving lines that, while complex, reinforce a notion of harmony, predictability, and rationality. The second diagram also places a cross in the middle to remind the reader of God's plan that underlies and sustains these relationships in the world. Three treatises follow that involve the determination of the annus domini (the Year of the Lord, or year of Christ's birth) including a nearly contemporary tract by Bishop Robert of Hereford (d. 1095) (fols. 17r-22r).138 As Wallis observes, the fact that Durham has this text demonstrates the wealth of scientific materials available at the monastery as well as the intellectual interests of the monks. She also notes the unusual arrangement and interaction between the three texts. Hereford's work comes first and serves to \"correct\" the annus domini calculation of the second, written by Dionysius Exiguus (written in 532 C.E.) (fols. 22r-22v). The Durham monks then placed another text by Dionysius, which includes a correction of another yet earlier author (fols. 22v-26r). Rounding out these works are tables used to calculate the date of Easter based on the work of Marianus Scottus, to whom Robert of Hereford was indebted for his understanding of the \"correct\" (fols. 27v- 137 Wallis, \"Albums of elements which make up the world: fire, air, earth, and water. They harmonize with the corresponding number of ages of human life--childhood, adolescence, youth, and old age--and also with the seasons of the year--spring, summer, autumn, and winter. And with these harmonize the four humours: namely, blood, red bile, melancholy and phlegm).\" 138 Robert of Hereford was formerly from the area near Li\u00e8ge, an intellectual center known for its advances in mathematics and astronomy. He along with others from the area were transferred to England by Norman command. Robert and another cleric, Walcher of Malvern (d. 1135), helped to develop a scientific center in the Severn/Wye region in England. Wallis, \"Albums of Science,\" 202. 58 41r).139 These tables also include annals from the Durham monastery, once again inserting the local community into this section of the manuscript. The final materials in the first computus section consist of excerpts from Guido of Arezzo's Micrologus (ca. 1030, fol. 41v-42r).140 Guido's work is a pedagogical and practical text meant to explain the science of music to a practitioner by virtue of the relationship of music to the harmonious structure of the universe.141 So, in one sense, this work focuses on the divinely created harmony of the universe; yet, it also has another function that links it to the three previous treatises and to the first text in the next section. The text in Hunter 100 largely comes from Micrologus, chapter 3, on the arrangement of seven notes on the monochord.142 The final lines in Hunter 100, which are found in the middle of chapter 3, make the following statement: 139 Wallis notes that these Paschal tables did not include an annus domini and in fact contained a rubric that references the problems of the Dionysian system. Wallis, \"Durham's 'Web of Science',\" 13. 140 In Hunter 100, one part of the text is attributed to Boethius with the rubric, item alia genera secundum BOETIVM. For an edition of the Micrologus, Mensura monochordi. La division \u00c9ditions Klincksieck, 1996). 141 The general concept of the relationship between music and the harmonious mathematical structure of the universe is found in Plato's Timaeus. (44) See also Macrobius, Commentaria in Somnium Scipionis, 2,3.1, 103 for the idea that sound was produced by the orbiting planets. James Haar, \"Music of the Spheres,\" Grove Music Online, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/19447; and Andrew James Hicks, Composing the World: Harmony in the Medieval Platonic Cosmos. New York: Oxford University Press, 2017. 142 Guido's work argues for a seven-letter notation system and produces a new visual system to designate pitch in music. The Micrologus, in full or abstract form, was one of the most widely disseminated texts of musical theory during the Middle Ages. Christian Meyer, \"La tradition du Micrologus de Guy d'Arezzo. Une Contribution \u00e0 l'Histoire de du uix Of the various ways of dividing the monochord, I have set down here only one, to which [the student] may devote his whole attention instead of to many and grasp [this same] without concerns; especially since [this method] would be of such great use and understood so easily; and once understood, not easily forgotten The Durham monks have chosen to end the first computus section with this scene: a student learning about the nature of the harmonious world and an author/teacher who is able to guide the learner to knowledge. The method the Micrologus author offers, he claims, is easier and more memorable than others. Like the former authors in this section, Guido corrects others using his pen and by the same offers further knowledge of the harmonious the world. 1.2d The Second Computus Booklet Beginning in the second computus booklet, the tenor of the manuscript changes. The texts and images present a world not altogether different, but more tempestuous. While the first half of the manuscript centers on Creation and the Christian world after the Incarnation, the second half seems to reflect the period between the Fall but before the annus domini. Rather than the Christianized zodiac, the more traditional pagan constellations appear, and texts offer ways to calculate time but do not pointedly focus on the date of the birth of Christ. While textual and visual elements of harmony appear, so also does a greater emphasis on 143 Transcription by Faith Wallis, \"29 Guido d'Arezzo and 'Boethius' on the Monochord (fols. 41v-42r),\" (unpublished notes, DWG); my translation. 60 irregular movement and change; and finally, corrections occur, but they are of a different and more violent type. The booklet opens with Helperic of Grandval's (ca. 900) textbook offering a method to measure time based on planetary movement. His De computo is a more general text than those found in the first computus section and does not specifically focus on the determination of the annus domini although the last half offers text-based instruction on methods to calculate the date of Easter. It does not, however, include associated tables. The text also contains some parallels to the excerpt from Guido of Arezzo, for like it Helperic's prologue claims to provide an easier method to gain knowledge than those which came before (fol. 43v). Sed these [things] offend the ears of anyone who is knowledgeable, may he not brand me with the label of rashness, but know that I have been obedient to the command of charity, and that I have served the benefit of fraternity, to the extent that aim is possible. Therefore, I have gathered together the most common arguments of the computus (pertaining to both individual days and the year)\u2014which not even a layman, much less a cleric, has ignored without retribution\u2014and having collected them from a variety of sources, have revised them with plainer language than that used by others, adding nothing of my own. But what by others [was made] more obscure I have represented more pleasingly and more clearly in the common language; so that if anyone will have observed [it] through the whole series, as it is 144 Transcription by Faith Wallis, \"30 Helperic De computo fols. 43r-59r,\" (unpublished notes, DWG); my translation. 61 worthy to be read, more easily will he explore the loftier heights of the doctors. While Helperic does not explicitly state which authors he was using and improving, the likely author was Bede, the only author mentioned by name in the text.145 Helperic's work is also notable because it contains two figural illustrations. The first illustration is on the initial folio of the booklet (fol. 43r) within a large \"C\" that opens the prologue to Helperic of Grandval's work, De computo (fig. 38). The second, a scene of violence, appears on the following recto (fol. 44r) and forms the letter \"A\" that begins the main text (fig. 39). Both have been the source of much puzzlement among scholars for two main reasons. First, no other extant version of Helperic's work contains either image; and second, Helperic's work is one of four computus texts within Hunter 100 and yet he is the only author to receive an illustration. A more understandable author portrait in Hunter 100 would have been that of Bede (d. 735)--abstracts from Bede's (d. 735) De temporum ratione follow Helperic's Durham held his bodily remains. Indeed, the Durham scriptorium produced another computus manuscript only a decade later in which the only illustration was an author portrait of Bede (fig. 40).146 While on one level this illustration may represent an author portrait, some inconsistencies between the text and image suggest that the depiction is not Helperic as author per se but instead may represent a type of generic student, teacher, or author at 145 Faith Wallis, \"\"30 Helperic De computo fols. 43r-59r,\" (unpublished notes, DWG). Wallis also points out that Helperic's text often acts as an \"adjunct or introduction\" to Bede as well as often accompanying Bede's De temporum ratione. 146 Glasgow, University Library, Hunter 85 (T.4.2), fol. 35r (second quarter twelfth century, Durham). This manuscript also contains three full works by Bede: De temporibus, De temporum ratione, and Epistola ad Wicthedum. Helperic's work is not included. 62 work. Indeed, no inscription identifies the figure as Helperic, even though the import of the opening lines seems to emphasize his status as teacher and author.147 In addition, while the opening words of Helperic's prologue describe and highlight his status as a monk, the figure does not bear a tonsure nor does he wear monastic garb.148 Yet his dress is significant. His long tunic has a detailed band at the waist and a flared and jagged bottom similar to that found on Virgo/Virgin Mary (fig. 31).149 Indeed, he is the only male figure in Hunter 100 to wear such clothes. His depiction is also similar to that of monks in contemporary Durham-created manuscripts (figs. 40-41).150 This association gives the figure a different stature in the second half of the manuscript. This figure, placed in the middle of the manuscript and whose body touches the final page of the booklet representing creation when the manuscript is closed, exemplifies the author 147 had begun to explain to our more youthful brothers some rudiments of the art of time reckoning, using the common language by which I conferred on them something of this knowledge that (as many believe) is not to be scorned, they\u2014whom I had [already] initiated to some degree, insofar as the divine munificence assisted, into the art of grammar\u2014began to emphatically insist, by what burning desire I do not know, that I should publish in some form of writing for the future benefit of many those things that I had [earlier] spoken by word of mouth, so that if when what the human mind, given over to diverse cares, is accustomed to forget [and] should pass from memory, they might be able to recover it somehow with the aid of letters). 148 The opening words, cum fratribus adolescentioribus nostris quaedam (our more youthful brothers) are rubricated and in capital letters. 149 Note also that Virgo's missing wings appear on the dragon that surrounds the author figure and create the letter large initial letter \"C.\" 150 See for example, the author portraits of Bede in Glasgow, University Library, Hunter 85 (T.4.2), fol. 35r (second quarter twelfth century); and Oxford, Bodleian, MS. Digby 20, fol. 194r (beginning of the twelfth century, Durham). 63 who uses his pen to create, compile, and/or correct. He is seated in an orderly fashion with his legs crossed to fit within the \"C\", one hand holds a quill pen while the other steadies a parchment folio, and his eyes focus on the parchment below. The stand or the manuscript is covered by a detailed textile indicating its special status. This is a (lay)man who diligently concentrates on his work and, perhaps, exemplifies correction by the pen. The second illustration, a scene of violent physical \"correction,\" depicts what happens when scholarship is laid aside.151 In this visually arresting scene, one man leans over while another stands above. One hand of the discipliner pulls up the tunic of the beaten man to expose his bottom and the other holds a large switch with which to strike him.152 An inscription makes the nature of the discipline clear: afflictur plagis quo non vult discere gratis (blows are afflicted on him who does not want to learn freely). This inscription does not appear in any other extant version of Helperic's work and was likely created by the Durham monks for this manuscript. In the Middle Ages, violence in the context of education was not necessarily conceived as a punishment but as an inducement to pay attention. William of Conches (1090-1154) argues that a \"sluggishness of intellect (ingenium)\" can be avoided by a beating.153 Later in the twelfth century, John of Salisbury links violence to the development 151 Wallis, \"Albums of Science,\" 212. 152 As Laura Cleaver cleverly notes, the shape of these bodies, forming the large initial \"A,\" when spoken aloud creates the sound \"Ahh\" potentially emitted from the mouth of the disciplined man. \"Illuminated Manuscripts and the Status of Science in Twelfth-Century England,\" (lecture, International Medieval Congress, University of Leeds, July 4, 2018). 153 William of Conches, Glosae in Iuvenalem (1130) ed. Bradford Libraire Philosophique J. 101-102. The attribution of this text to Conches has been lately challenged. 64 of wisdom in that it helps to generate critical thinking.154 Among modern scholars, Mary Carruthers has described the ability of the rod to spur the memory,155 and more recently Irina Dumitrescu has drawn a particular connection between Anglo-Saxon educational strategies and pain, where \"the very desire for learning is depicted in painful language.\"156 In an educational context, the correction of a spanking is supposed to induce self-discipline. Indeed, the spanking scene must have resonated with the Durham monks, for they included a similar scene in a sculpted portal at the western end of the nave of their new cathedral. The episode appears on the north doorway along with other examples of sin and discipline (fig. 42).157 The bottom left and right of the archway display the theme of sin; the middle left and right depict discipline with the aforementioned spanking scene and one with wrestlers; and finally, the top of the doorway portrays salvation with an Agnus Dei (willing submission to sacrifice), a centaur (likely representing wisdom),158 and Samson (strength). 154 John of (1159), Metalogicon, ed K.S.B.

The sculpture is quite worn, but one can make out the \"teacher\" on the left raising his arm to spank the \"student\" on the right, who lays across the teacher's knees and holds his hands in supplication. According to Turnock, the sculpture was created around 1120. Because of its location, in the nave, it may not have been a scene that was often viewed by the Durham monks but instead by religious and lay visitors to the abbey. 158 The centaur can also represent the dual nature of human beings, for the lower part of his body is made up of a beast and higher of the human body. In Hunter 100, the artists have chosen to represent both Sagittarius figures as centaurs--in other contexts, Sagittarius appears as a satyr. The Sagittarius 65 Here the violence of a beating becomes a step towards self-discipline, wisdom, and the ultimate sacrifice of one's life to God. Yet the iconography in Hunter 100 is not entirely clear. Most scholars have interpreted this image as a master beating a student, based largely on the rubricated inscription that appears above. The image, however, does not clearly show an adult master beating a younger student.159 The beater is not bearded and the height of the beaten man seems to be such that if he stood up, he would be the same size. Furthermore, the inscription itself may have other shades of meaning. The Latin verb discere, which has been translated using its primary definition, \"to learn,\" can also mean to teach. According to Dumitrescu, Anglo-Saxon sources show that violent encounters in the schoolroom did not always involve a teacher against a student but also the inversion--student(s) against a teacher when he fails to instruct.160 As will be discussed below, the example of an upended hierarchy, in which students must admonish a negligent master, foreshadows one of the main concerns of the Durham monks and one of the possible functions of Hunter 100 itself. After Helperic's work are paraphrases of Bede's De temporum ratione and De natura rerum on the units of time and celestial objects.161 The placement of a Bede text after that of Helperic--a text that presumably improves it--in one sense is similar to that found in the first computus section where Robert of Hereford's text criticizing Dionysius's work came figure, his representation in Hunter 100, and in the Durham monastery will be discussed in more detail below. 159 Cleaver, \"Illuminated Manuscripts and the Status of Science.\" 160 \"The Instructional Moment,\" 4-5. 161 Wallis, \"Albums of Science,\" 212. 66 before the latter. Yet at the same time, there are more ambiguities. Only parts of Bede's work are included, they do not address the calculation of time, and, while the Durham monks clearly had access to Bede's original work, these abstracts are in paraphrase form.162 One cannot help wondering if another upended hierarchy is suggested. These are followed by two astronomical texts without rubrics, perhaps suggesting that they too were the works of Bede. The first is known as the Excerptum de astrologiae and describes the spatial relationships between the constellations in the sky.163 The second has been attributed to ps.-Bede, De signis caeli, and provides details on the number and spatial placement of the stars within the constellation and, in a few cases, other descriptive information about the constellation.164 In Hunter 100, constellation images only appear in the ps.-Bede text (fols. 61v-64v).165 The typical ps.-Bede text contains forty illustrations of the 162 Wallis, \"Albums of Science,\" 212, fn. 45, states that they likely derive from a didactic, \"question and answer\" treatise and notes the likenesses to divisionibus temporum, a seventh-century Irish work. 163 Ram\u00edrez-Weaver, \"Coordinating Classical Traditions,\" 4. The two texts are also found together in an early ninth-century computus encyclopedia, The Handbook of 809. 164 For more information on both astronomical texts and their derivation from the Aratus latinus, see Hubert Le Bourdell\u00e8s, L'Aratus et la Nord de la de constellation images in Hunter 100 have attracted the most scholarly attention. They have been included in synthesizing works by Kurt Weitzmann, Fritz Saxl, and Dieter Blume, which, in general, trace changes in the figuration of constellation images over time rather than considering specific examples within the context of their manuscript settings. Fritz Saxl and Hans Weitzmann, Illustrations in Roll and Codex: A Study of the Origin and Method of Text Illustration (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1970), 158; Dieter Blume, Saxl focus on the transmission of constellation imagery from Antiquity and in the case of Saxl, to the Early Modern era. For Blume, provenance is less important; rather he considers later astronomical illustrations as important cultural objects in their own time of production. For another large collection of images, descriptions of manuscripts with astronomical illustrations, and a substantial bibliography, see the website, The Saxl Project, created and maintained by Kristin 67 constellations followed by five personified planets. Yet in Hunter 100, only twenty-five constellations currently appear due to the loss of two folios in the middle of the text.166 While the constellation images in Hunter 100 generally follow traditional Western precedents (based on Carolingian models of classical illustrations), many are unusual.167 First, none of the images show the stars that make up the constellations.168 While this is not unprecedented, at minimum it suggests that the illustrations were not used as tools to locate the positions of the constellations. In addition, some of the depictions of the constellations diverge from traditional patterns. Kristin Lippincott, who has developed a system of Lippincott, https://www.thesaxlproject.com/the-saxl-project. The Warburg Institute also maintains an image database which is available online, https://iconographic.warburg.sas.ac.uk/vpc/VPC_search/subcats.php?cat_1=9&cat_2=71. The most recent examination of the constellation images in Hunter 100 by Ram\u00edrez-Weaver, \"Coordinating Classical Traditions,\" (forthcoming), has shown the diverse styles and models from which the images derive. 166 The missing constellation would have presumably included Ursa Minor, Draco, Hercules, Corona Borealis, Serpens, Scorpio, Bootes, Virgo, Cassiopeia. 167 Ram\u00edrez-Weaver, \"Coordinating Classical Traditions,\" 5-11, examines the Hunter 100 illustrations in relation to earlier precedents. For the Carolingian examples, also see his work, A Saving Science, esp. 69-122. Lippincott, The Saxl Project, focuses on their unusual features in relation to illustrations in other De signis caeli texts. 168 For more on the relevance of the appearance of stars in illustrations of the constellations, see Arnaud Zucker, \"Exploring the Relevance of the Star-Positions in the Medieval Illuminated Manuscripts of Hyginus' De Astronomia,\" in Certissima signa: A Venice Conference on Greek and Filippomaria Pontani (Venice: Edizioni Ca'Foscari, 2017), 153-212. Zucker suggests that the creation of constellation images that do not show stars was intentional in order to place greater emphasis on the illustrations as \"mythological portraits rather than astronomical diagrams.\" Ibid., 158. Examples of bodies with and without stars occurs in all variations of the astronomical texts. Stars are displayed on the bodies of constellations in, for example, Leiden, Universiteitsbiblioteek, Voss. Lat. 4\u00b0 79 (Germanicus, Latin version of Aratus's Phaenomena); London, BL, MS Harley 647 (Cicero, Latin version of Aratus's Phaenomena); Paris, Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, lat. 14754 (Ps.-Bede, De signis caeli); cf. bodies without stars in Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional MS 19 (16) (Germanicus), G\u00f6ttweig, Stiftsbibliothek MS 7 De signis caeli). 68 categorization for De signis caeli illustrations, places them in a solitary group.169 Rather than creating a classification system by type, Eric Ram\u00edrez-Weaver stresses the wide variety of stylistic models used by the artist, a diversity that he argues reflects the wealth of materials the monks had at hand as well as an ambitious intellectual program.170 In addition to these conclusions, I will argue here that at least some artistic decisions were made in order to emphasize larger themes implied by the arrangement of the manuscript--more specifically, first, to contrast with the Christianized zodiac figures in the first computus booklet and, second, to make iconographic links to figures in the cautery illustrations placed at the end of the manuscript. The inclusion of both calendrical zodiac and astronomical illustrations in a single contemporary manuscript has no surviving parallel to my knowledge. In any event, the choice made by the Durham monks was not common. It created, in the most general sense, a contrast between the Christianized zodiac figures holding instruments reflecting virtuous qualities (or in the case of Sagittarius in Hunter 100, an ineffective arrow) and the pagan constellations who engage in battle and whose instruments are weapons.171 Because the 169 \"[T]he divergences [from other De manuscripts] are too great to see [the images] anything but peripheral to [the De group. Lippincott, \"Durham Saxl Project, online at https://www.thesaxlproject.com/assets/Uploads/MSS-descriptions-Durham-Hunter-100-ps-Bede-De-Signis-caeli-12-Nov-2012.pdf. Lippincott specifically 170 \"They offered intelligent readers a repository of forms linked to the traditions of the De signis coeli, Ram\u00edrez-Weaver, \"Coordinating Classical Traditions,\" 11. 171 The depictions of the constellations bearing weapons and engaging in combat is part of the classical tradition. I am not arguing that the Hunter 100 illustrations are different in that they portray the constellations in such ways. Rather, my argument is that the juxtaposition of Christianized zodiac figures and the typically pagan constellation images within the same manuscript is an important and meaningful choice made by the Durham monks. 69 images of Scorpio, Virgo, Gemini, Libra, Cancer, Leo, and Taurus are missing from the constellation section, an in-depth examination of specific differences is impossible; however, there remain notable distinctions between the surviving pairs. The depiction of the zodiac-Pisces lacks the line connecting the two fish, which represents additional stars in the constellation (fig. 43). The line does appear in the constellation-Pisces as a wide band decorated with dots, however it attaches the two fish by their tails rather than the more usual position at their mouths (fig. 44). According to Ram\u00edrez-Weaver, the tail-to-tail depiction is often found in another astronomical text based on the translation of Germanicus, where \"[the rope] restrict[s] their mobility and reportedly causes them to fight for dominance as they swim in opposite directions.\"172 In Hunter 100, while the zodiac-fish are free, the constellation-fish are tethered at the tail and fighting for power. Differences can also be seen in the two depictions of Capricorn, Aquarius, and Sagittarius. The two depictions of Capricorn are important for the thematic contrasts between the two halves of the manuscript. While in most respects the two figures are identical, the long horns of the constellation-Capricorn have been painted red as if to emphasize their use as weapons (figs. 45-46). The varying depictions of the Aquarius figure offer more thematic associations (figs. 47-48). The first distinction appears in their dress. Whereas the zodiac-Aquarius appears in an older late antique fashion with embroidered bands across the arms and skirt of his tunic, the constellation-Aquarius wears contemporary Anglo-Saxon dress: a tunic with long sleeves, embroidered chlamys fastened at the top with a brooch.173 Thus 172 Saving Science, 103. For this explanation, he cites the text associated with this image from the Carolingian manuscript, the Leiden Aratea (Leiden, Universiteitsbibliotheek, VLQ 79, fol. 39r). 173 The dress of the some of the astronomical figures in Hunter 100 is described in Weitzmann, Illustrations in Roll and Codex, 158-160. 70 while the constellation figure has been brought into contemporary twelfth-century life, the ancient dress of the zodiac figure placed him in a different world outside of the present time. The second difference occurs in the composition of the bodies. The constellation-Aquarius is portrayed as if running. He holds a jar of water out to his left while his body and head twist backward as if to see his pursuer. In contrast, the zodiac-Aquarius's body faces forward, but his torso and head twists toward the martyrology and the vase with flowing waters that he holds in both hands. While the constellation-Aquarius is distracted from his duty of pouring water, his head turned in the opposite direction from the vase, the zodiac Aquarius stares directly down at the jar and flowing waters, as do two pen-trial onlookers that appear above his left shoulder.174 The varying foci of attention--a feature emphasized by the onlookers in the liturgical calendar--reappears again in other constellation images as well as in one figure in the cautery illustrations and will be discussed below. It is also suggested in the distinction between the two illustrations in the Helperic text: the focused author who contrasts with the student or teacher whose distraction from his studies is corrected. The differences between the two Sagittarius figures in Hunter 100 also exemplify themes of correction. Both the zodiac- and the constellation-Sagittarius are depicted just as an arrow leaves their bow. The zodiac-Sagittarius, however, because of his placement on the page, aims his arrow at the empty martyrology on his right (fig. 49). In contrast, the placement of the constellation figure allows his arrow to fly directly into the text block describing Orion and\u2014more specifically\u2014into the words in capite, and thus presumably into Orion's head (fig. 50). The arrow of zodiac-Sagittarius does not need to correct saints and 174 Another drawing of a partial face appears to the right of Aquarius and faces the martyrology. Perhaps it directs the reader's attention to the holy figures, feasts, and astronomical events listed there. 71 martyrs listed in the calendar, while the arrow of the constellation-Sagittarius corrects a notably unvirtuous figure.175 The depiction of Sagittarius is also notable in that the hat he wears has been replicated on two other astronomical figures in Hunter 100, Perseus and the planet Mars, as well as two figures in the cautery illustrations. As will be discussed in more detail below, this repetition of iconography not only serves to link the illustrations in the computus and medical booklets, but also offers one key to the function of the cautery illustrations in the manuscript. Following the constellation illustrations is Abbo of Fleury's Studiosus Astrologiae, another work on the cosmos. Accompanying Abbo's text are two diagrams--the only two diagrams in the second computus booklet--and a number that mirrors the two harmony diagrams in the first booklet on folio 16v. Both concern aspects of the cosmos, but visually they are very different. Instead of focusing on the static fundamental harmonies of the universe, the diagrams in the second booklet emphasize change and movement. First to appear is a planetary evagations diagram depicting planets that \"wander\" (Latin, errantia, and with connotations of straying randomly) (fig. 51, fol. 66r). The visual impact of the diagram, one of sharp, spikey, and irregular change, is radically different than the symmetrical and harmonious rotae in the first booklet.176 The second diagram also visually presents change, depicting the phases (i.e., changes) of the moon (fig. 52, fol. 67r). 175 Cicero's Latin translation of the Aratea casts Orion as mad and deranged (errans, amens, vecors). He is also known for attempting to rape the goddess, Diane and for attacking the Pleiades. David P. Kubiak, \"The Orion story, see Hyginus, De astronomica, 2.21. 176 A cosmic gamut table below the diagram offers a reference to notions of harmony. Wallis, \"Albums of Science, 214, notes that the text expresses the distances between planets as musical intervals and thereby refers to the underlying celestial harmonies created by God. Even though this section of the manuscript presents a world after the Fall, harmony may still be achieved. For more on planetary evagation diagrams as well as the Abbonian treatise in which it is found see \"6. 72 The computus section ends with three more abstracts from Isidore of Seville's Etymologies, on astronomy (Book 3), excerpts from Book 5 on the units of time, and another set of excerpts on weights and measures, ending with pharmaceutical measures from Book 16 (fols. 69v-82r).177 The final text in the booklet is a Latin to Old English list of plants (fols. 82r-84v). 1.2e The Second Medical Booklet The final medical section acts as a bookend for the computus materials and, as Wallis notes, the texts mirror the first but with altered themes. Rather than reflecting ideas related to the body as formed by God and the plants created to nourish and sustain it, the second booklet focuses on the medical cures required after the Fall and the advent of disease. While the texts mirror those found in the first medical section, the images of cautery procedures, placed in the final position, have no such parallel. Indeed, no illustrations appear in the first medical booklet. Yet, on one level they \"fit\" within the second medical booklet and the second half of the manuscript. The illustrations offer yet another form of cure for diseased bodies and, like the illustrations in the second computus section, show a more violent one involving the placement of a burning hot iron on the skin of a non-anesthetized patient.178 As Cosmographical Anthology: 9. Cloister, https://digital.library.mcgill.ca/ms-17/folio.php?p=38r&showitem=38r_6Cosmography_9PlanetaryEvagations. 177 Wallis, \"Albums of Science,\" 214. 178 This assessment of cautery procedures is not solely my own. Ancient and medieval authors also discussed the suffering this treatment caused patients. Indeed, Hippocrates suggests cautery only as the final option for cure. Aphorisms, VII.87, in Hippocrates, Volume I, trans. by W.H.S. Jones (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2014), 217. 73 will be described in detail below, my argument is that they also include thematic material from the first half of the manuscript and act as a coda, summarizing the themes of the manuscript as a whole. The initial texts in the second medical booklet mirror the Isidorian texts on nourishing plants found in the first. Here, however, the texts name plants as curing agents for specific diseases. The first, appearing on folios 102r-113r, contains a comprehensive list of medical recipes for various diseases in a roughly head-to-foot order.179 The second is an alphabetical list of medicinal plants with descriptions of their use for various illnesses (fol. 82r-84v).180 Mirroring the work on the four humours in the first medical section is another excerpt on the four humors (fols. 115v-117r). No rubrics introduce the text, words \"Corpus hominis ex quattuor humoribus constat (the human body consists of four humours)\" begins with a coloured \"C.\" The latter text has a different focus than the first. It discusses disease as related to the four major body regions and provides medical recipes specific to each part. It also provides insight into the temperaments, or the moral characteristics aroused in the human soul by the dominance of one of the humours in living men form the character. Blood makes those of good devotion simple, moderate, pleasing, and whole. Red biles makes them prone to anger, clever, sharp, light, thin, eating much, and digesting 179 Wallis, \"Album of Science,\" 215. 180 The list ends with the letter \"N\" and the plant nardi spica. 74 quickly. The phlegms in a well-ordered body make them vigilant, quick to have grey hair, and less daring. The black biles make them deceitful when accompanied by anger, greedy, fearful, frequently drowsy, and having marks on their feet. Furthermore, those who have the fiery virtue are dominated by the superior parts of the body.181 This text thus clearly lays out how the humours may make humans more likely to sin. The final texts in the second section reflect the sentiments of the Ambrosian and Rabbanus texts. The first notes the virtues of the hellebore (fol. 117r), a plant specifically named by Ambrose as one that is deadly (letalia et perniciosa) and, moreover, deceives the gatherer (frequenter et decipiunt colligentum) because it can be found growing among plants that sustain life (inter alia quoque nutrimenta helleborus deprehenditur). The second text provides additional recipes and medical charms and prayers. Prayers and charms were not uncommon additions to medieval medical books and were based on remedies that descend from classical traditions. They are even found in the works of later medieval medical scholars based at universities.182 One example in Hunter 100 concerns fevers and recommends that the following \"be written and hung around the neck\" (hec scribentur. Et in collo ligentur) (fol. 118r). 181 My transcription and translation. An edition of the letter can be found in Theodori Prisciani 1894), 484-492. The text in Hunter 100 leaves out a reference to the possibility of an inexperienced or negligent doctor who does not recognize the humour from which a disease has originated. Ibid., 490. Si inperitum quo umore aegritudo nata fuerit...(if a patient were to have an inexperienced or really negligent doctor who would not understand the cause or from which humour the sickness was produced...). 182 Lea T. Olsan, \"Charms and Prayers in Medieval Medical Theory and Practice,\" Social History of Medicine 6 (2003): 343-366. For charms in English manuscripts, see Olsan, \"Latin Charms of Medieval England: Verbal Healing in a Christian Oral Tradition,\" Oral Tradition 7 (1992): 116-42 and Tony Hunt, Popular Medicine in Thirteenth-Century England (Woodbridge: Brewer, 1990). 75 In nazarenus rex iudeorum In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Telon. Salvation belongs to the Lord. Salvation belongs to Christ. May your salvation, Lord, be ever with me, N. Holy Trinity, heal me from the enemies of my body and soul. Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews. 183 As suggested in the final Rabbanus Maurus text in the first medical section, prayers that demonstrate faith in the power of God can also serve to cure. The mirroring phenomenon between the first and second medical booklets breaks down, however, with the final set of materials--the three folios of cautery illustrations. There are no corresponding illustrations in the first medical section nor any references to cautery or surgery. While they presumably reflect a medical remedy meant to cure disease, unlike any surviving collection of cautery procedures, there are no adjacent texts to identify the surgeries.184 The lack of medical inscriptions is even more surprising considering the comprehensive and well-organized medical texts placed before them. Rather than simply acting as another set of medical corrections or cures, I argue that the cautery illustrations act as a coda for the entire manuscript. Just like the musical term on which this metaphor is 183 Transcription and translation by Sarah Gilbert and Faith Wallis, \"44 Receptarium 2 (fols. 117r-118r)\" (unpublished notes, DWG). 184 At a minimum, extant cautery illustrations usually indicate the disease for which a patient is being treated; for example, \"ad epar (for the liver)\" in London, BL, Harley MS fol. 8v. Others provide details of where cautery irons are placed. See for example, Munich, BSB, Clm 13002, fol. 1v. In Hunter 100, the disease sometimes can be conjectured by the placement of the marks. See Appendix B for a detailed comparison of the depictions of the Hunter 100 patients to other twelfth-century cautery illustrations. 76 based, the cautery illustrations both summarize and sharpen; they sift through themes, stressing some elements and passing by others. All told, they present an expanded notion of who and what can correct or cure, but also harm. They visually combine physical and moral cure, highlight potentially harmful agents, and stress the stringent discipline required to gain knowledge of such dangers and their remedies. Moreover, like the annals placed in the first computus booklet, the illustrations return the Durham monastery into the thematic program. 1.3 The Cautery Illustrations The choice of cautery images for a computus manuscript is unusual in many ways. Not only are there no other extant models of this combination but there are also no computus manuscripts that include cautery texts.185 Other types of medical texts, however, were integrated into computus collations beginning in the early Middle Ages. In general, these were related to medical prognostics, whereby the computation of dates was used to determine whether a patient would live or die.186 Cautery procedures were not thought to involve proper timing, except in the most general way. Moreover, at this point in the twelfth century there was still only a vague idea of celestial influence on the human body, a notion that was to 185 There is at least one precedent for the combination of computus materials and medical recipes/lists of herbs (in addition to other medical works) The contemporary manuscript St. John's 17 contains both (fols. 1v-2v and 175v-177v), though the medical materials are much fewer than in Hunter 100. Wallis, \"MS 17: Description,\" in Calendar and the Cloister, online at https://digital.library.mcgill.ca/ms-17/apparatus.php?page=MS17_Description. 186 Some prognostic diagrams include figural images. See for example, the Sphere of Life and Death (Sphere of Apuleius) in London, BL, Cotton MS Tiberius C. VI, fol. 6v (third quarter of the eleventh century to the second half of the twelfth); Roy Michael Liuzza, \"The Sphere of Life and Death: Time, Medicine, and the Visual Imagination,\" in Latin Learning and English Lore: Studies in Anglo-Saxon Literature for Michael Lapidge, 2 vols., eds. Katherine O'Brien O'Keefe and Andy Orchard (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2005), II, 28-52. 77 become more explicit and theoretical later in the century.187 What, then, was the associative link that led the monks of Durham to add cautery illustrations to their manuscript? Wallis notes that computus manuscripts often act as a \"filing cabinet\" or as a place to store scientific literature that has some connection, however tenuous, to either time or measurement. Unlike bloodletting, however, no texts, charts or calendars survive that were explicitly used to determine the best times to perform a cautery procedure. It is also possible the monks associated cautery procedures with a vague type of measurement. Some but not all cautery inscriptions specify the place on the body to be burned in terms of palm widths or number of digits away from another body part.188 Most texts, however, only name the body part on which the hot iron is to be placed. Another contention is that cautery illustrations often appear with herbals, and Hunter 100 contains a Latin to Old English glossary as well as multiple plant lists.189 In one sense, the latter assertion is correct. There are three surviving manuscripts that include cautery images and a materia medica, the Pseudo-Apuleius Complex, which also contains medicines from both plants and animals and will be discussed 187 The chapter in which Isidore notes the general influence of the movement of the stars on the human body, Etymologies 4.13.4, is included in the Durham manuscript (fol. 90r). Later in the twelfth century, theoretical treatises on astrological medicine were translated into Latin and spread throughout Western Europe. For a survey of the latter tradition, see Charles Burnett, \"Astrology,\" in Medieval Latin Studies: An Introduction and Bibliographical Guide, eds. F.A.C Mantello and A.G. Rigg (Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 1996), 369-82. See also, Astro-Medicine: Astrology and Medicine, East and West, eds. Anna Akasoy, Charles Burnett, and Ronit Yoeli-Tlalim (Florence, SISMEL-Ed. del Galluzzo, 2008). 188 For example, Clm 13002 describes the placement of a cautery iron in the following way: et in anteriori parte quantum tenditur palma (as much as a palm width is extended in accordance with the other region). In BnF 7028, the treatment for maniae or eplempsiae mensura retro ab aure uncias digiti duas (measure one and two digits behind the ear) in order to find the correct place for the cautery iron. 189 Minta Collins, Medieval Herbals: The Illustrative Tradition (London: The British Library and Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2000), 180-183. 78 in greater detail in chapter 2. Hunter 100 does not include materials from the Complex but has its own unique collection of texts that involve medicinal (and aromatic) plants. Moreover, cautery illustrations do not always appear with herbal texts. The final manuscript discussed in this study (Munich, BSB, Clm 13002) includes images of cautery with glossaries and biblical commentaries. While the herbal/cautery connection has some merit, it hardly provides a definitive reason for the inclusion of surgical illustrations in Hunter 100. While it is possible that the Durham monks considered these links, there are other more persuasive connections that relate cautery to computus. First, the visual representations of cautery patients parallel the representations of personified constellations that often appear in computus manuscripts, for both depict marks on bodies.190 In the case of the constellations, these marks signify the fiery stars that make up the form of their heavenly bodies (figs. 53-55), while the marks on the cautery patients' material bodies represent burns produced by a fiery hot cautery iron.191 In addition, both astronomical and cautery texts identify the spatial 190 For more on the relevance of the appearance of asterisks in illustrations of the constellations, see Arnaud Zucker, \"Exploring the Relevance of the Star-Positions in the Medieval Illuminated Manuscripts of Hyginus' De Astronomia,\" in Certissima signa: A Venice Conference on Greek and Filippomaria Pontani (Venice: Edizioni Ca'Foscari, 2017), 153-212. Zucker suggests that the creation of constellation images that do not show stars was intentional and placed greater emphasis on the illustrations as \"mythological portraits rather than astronomical diagrams.\" Zucker, 158. Examples of bodies with and without stars occurs in all variations of the astronomical texts. Stars are displayed on the bodies of constellations in, for example, Leiden, Universiteitsbiblioteek, Voss. Lat. 4\u00b0 79 (Germanicus, Latin version of Aratus's Phaenomena); London, BL, Harley MS 647 (Cicero, Latin version of Aratus's Phaenomena); Paris, Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, lat. 14754 (Ps.-Bede, De signis caeli); cf. bodies without stars in Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional MS 19 (16) (Germanicus), G\u00f6ttweig, Stiftsbibliothek MS 7 De signis Tiberius B V.1, fol. 34r (second quarter of the eleventh century to third quarter of the twelfth); Sagittarius, London, BL, Cotton MS Tiberius C.1, fol. the MS. Digby 83, fol. 62v (1150). 79 placement of marks or stars on bodies. The constellation text in Hunter 100, De signis caeli, situates stars within the constellations by referring to body parts.192 Concerning Aries. Aries has one star on his head, three on his nose, two on his neck, one on the top of his back foot, four on his back, one on his tail, three on his abdomen, one on his hips, [and] one on his highest foot. There are seventeen [stars] in all.193 Although not included in Hunter 100, the cautery text in Paris, BnF, lat. 7028, from the late eleventh century, describes a procedure for elefantiosis in a similar way: Two burns on both neck veins and four above the stomach in the manner of a cross and two below the navel and two on the upper leg on the outside and two on the other [upper leg] and two under the ankle of one foot on the inside and on the outside and two under the other [ankle] and two under the highest point of the shoulder blades and two on the kidneys and two on the veins of the lower legs and two on the buttocks with the round iron.194 The constellation and cautery texts thus share the same conceptual structure. Both are concerned with the exact placement of marks that are arranged spatially on a body. Other reasons for the Durham monks to combine cautery with computus involve features unique to Hunter 100 and the monastic and historical context in which it was created. I have already mentioned their connections to the themes of the second half of the 192 For more on this text, see Kristin Lippincott, \"Pseudo-Bede, De signis caeli,\" summitate anterioris pedis .I. in dorso .IIII. in cauda in sum[m]o due sub umbilico et due in coxa a foris et due in alia et II sub nodo unius pedis ab intus et et II sub et II sub summitate scapularum et II in renibus et II super venas tibiarum et II in natibus cum cauterio rotundo; my translation. 80 manuscript--as another application of the theory of cure and one involving a type of violence, but the illustrations also integrate themes from the first half of the manuscript. They offer a broad conception of disease and cure and are concerned with the \"doctor's hand.\" Moreover, they integrate Durham and its contemporary concerns into the manuscript reminding them of the \"correction\" of monastic reform and the \"cure\" of undertaking the strict, focused discipline of the Rule of St. Benedict. 1.3a Cautery and Monastic Discipline Eight illustrations of cautery procedures fill the final three folios in Hunter 100 (figs. 56-58). On the first folio of images (fig. 56), two men hold tools that identify them as medical professionals. A bearded, experienced surgeon is aided by a younger, unbearded apprentice who gently holds down the shoulder of the central patient, while another man below holds cautery irons at the fire. On the second folio of cautery illustrations, a doctor appears on the top left holding a flat-ended cautery rod and wearing what should be a Phrygian hat, a common type for depicting medical authors and also associated with wise men of the ancient East (see, for example, fig. 59), but here it looks like a miter worn by a twelfth-century bishop (fig. 60).195 Depictions of five patients displaying burn marks on their bodies appear after the doctor. Like the first patient, all show burn marks on their heads and 195 I would like to thank Dr. Jill Caskey for identifying this detail. Sculpture, Man with a Phrygian Cap, Second Century, Louvre Museum; Bishop's Miter from the Abbey of Seligenthal, Bavaria, twelfth century (Byzantine silk with English embroidery showing the martyrium of St. Thomas a Becket). Normally the Phrygian hat is worn by a seated figure who holds a text to indicate his status as a medical author. See, for example, Eton College, MS 204, fol. 2r; London, Ambrosiana, Codex Ambrosianus D 2, fol. 2r. 81 two also have marks on their torsos. The final folio of cautery illustrations contains only two patients, the first with a mark on his chin and the second with six marks on his chest. While these features of the illustrations suggest a medical context, many other visual aspects of the Hunter 100 cautery illustrations call into question their medical use. Foremost is the lack of inscriptions on the folios. Unlike any other contemporary set of cautery illustrations, there are no adjacent texts to identify the surgeries.196 This is particularly odd considering that the illustrations follow a highly organized and exhaustive set of recipes for medications (fols. 102r-113r).197 The doctor's miter-like hat on the second folio of illustrations requires explanation, and there are also other oddities including the unconventional depictions of some of the patients and the repetition of cautery marks on a majority of their heads. The first four patients--half of the total--show only two marks placed on their foreheads. In no other set of cautery illustrations do half of the patients have head ailments, nor do the standard illustrations of conditions related to the head depict only two marks on the forehead. The repetition of these marks thus demands to be considered. In addition, the context and positioning of the head patients' bodies is unusual. The artist has rendered the first patient in a dramatic recumbent pose and placed him on a regal throne-like chair in an ornate architectural context. The other three head patients are notable for their conspicuous gestures. One points at the doctor, another at his head, and the third looks out directly at the reader and points either to empty space or the folio before. It also appears that 196 In some cases, the disease can be conjectured by the placement of the marks. See Appendix B for a detailed comparison of the depictions of the patients and the marks to other twelfth-century cautery illustrations. 197 At a minimum, extant cautery illustrations usually indicate the disease for which a patient is being treated; for example, \"ad epar (for the liver)\" in London, BL, Harley MS fol. 8v. Others provide details of where cautery irons are placed. See for example, Munich, BSB, Clm 13002, fol. 1v. 82 the artists have intentionally chosen different sources for the depictions of their patients, some of which may be non-medical. One of the patients in conversation sits with one knee raised on a rounded arch (fig. 61)\u2014surely an odd position for a cautery patient and a pose similar to depictions of the constellation Eridanus, a river god who appears in many astronomical works (for example, fig. 62) and in Hunter 100 (fig. 63).198 The arch upon which he sits is itself puzzling and resembles the arcade design on the recto at the top of the fireplace. Additionally, no other patient appears in such a position in any other extant illustration of cautery. While the first four patients are without beards and are dressed in similar short tunics, the remaining two patients on folio 119v are partially undressed, bearded, and their bodies, as well as their heads, also bear marks (fig. 64). In addition to their different depictions, they also look out of place on the page. The ground line, which is shown above, disappears and they appear lower, and in the case of the final patient on the page, larger than the others. Here, the artists seemed to have borrowed material from a medical source, one similar to that used by the artists of London, BL, Sloane MS 2839, fol. 2r (\"Sloane 2839,\" England, late eleventh or early twelfth century) (fig. 65). As in Sloane 2839, one patient holds his head as if in pain, while the other immediately adjacent stands with open arms in an orant-style position.199 Neither of the patients in Sloane 2839 stand on a ground line. 198 London, BL, Harley MS 2506, fol. 42v (ca. 990-1100, Fleury, possibly brought to England by Abbo of Fleury) and the same figure in Hunter 100, fol. 64r. 199 The marks on the patients in Sloane 2839 are not identical to those on the patients in Hunter 100. While inscription associated with the first patient in Sloane 2839 has been erased, the marks on his body are confined to the mid- and upper torso and the neck. The similar patient in Hunter 100 has marks on his head, neck, wrists lower torso, knees, and ankles. The second patient in Sloane 2839 is being treated for interocellicos (hernia) and bears two marks above his testicles. In Hunter 100, the patient's marks are located on his head, upper chest, and lower right torso. 83 Despite the similarity of the Hunter 100 images to those in Sloane 2839, a description of their differences is revealing. Sloane 2839 shows additional medical tools. Cups have been placed alongside patients' heads, possibly containing medication for surgical aftercare (fig. 66). Sloane 2839 also depicts the doctors differently and none appear in an extensive architectural structure. The two doctors in Sloane 2839 wear long toga-like tunics, and one is clearly tonsured (fig. 67). The most striking differences appear in the depiction of the patients. While in Hunter 100 patients wear some amount of clothing and none expose their genital region, all Sloane 2839 patients are fully naked with genitals clearly depicted. In addition, while six out of the eight Hunter 100 patients suffer from at least one head-related disease, all those in Sloane 2839 suffer from illnesses of the entire body. Florence Eliza Glaze argues that the Sloane illustrations, in addition to other textual sources in the manuscript, \"conveyed real practical information that easily could have supplemented or initiated greater understanding of medical techniques that could be pursued further in the course of empirical training.\"200 While I may temper her evaluation of the illustrations as purely practical and pedagogical, in general this comparison highlights the fact that Hunter 100 does not seem interested in the details of actual surgical procedures and contains unusual, non-medical elements. A final remarkable feature of the Hunter 100 cautery illustrations is the depiction of the first procedure (fig. 56). Here, the artists have chosen to highlight it with an entire folio and a grand, two-tiered architectural setting. No other contemporary cautery depiction 200 Glaze, \"Master-Student Medical Dialogues: The Evidence of London, British Library, Sloane 2839,\" in Form and Content of Instruction in Anglo-Saxon England in Light of Contemporary Manuscript Evidence. Papers presented at the International Conference Udine, 6-8 April 2006, 467-494, 487. 84 affords such grandeur and Hunter 100 gives the same striking attention to the heating of the cautery irons as to the surgery itself, affording it the entire lower level of the structure.201 Yet instead of the usual heating implement--a small brazier found in contemporary manuscripts (figs. 68-69)--the artists have designed a large ornate fireplace, notably without a fire, for this purpose.202 What is more, the appearance of the helper at the fire is striking. His pagan-like hat mimics those found on Perseus, Sagittarius, and Mars in the constellation section, and his bare chest and wide lunging stance are unusual. His importance is further emphasized by the fact that he reappears in slightly different garb, but including the hat, as the final cautery patient on folio 120r (fig. 58)--a repetition that raises the question of his identity and function. Is he a medical helper or yet another ailing patient? Perhaps due to all these eccentricities, the cautery illustrations in Hunter 100 have not been thoroughly addressed in the scholarly literature. The few times that these cautery images have been discussed, they have been generally described as typical surgical procedures that have been abstracted from a more complete Late Antique or Carolingian 201 The earliest extant set of cautery procedures from the ninth or tenth century, found in Florence, Laurenziana, Plut. 73. 41, gives each surgery a full folio, but instead of an architectural space, all figures appear to float on the page. A tenth-century Byzantine manuscript depicting orthopedic procedures, Florence, Laurenziana, Plut. 74. 7, gives each a full page and some architectural features, however double columns and arches appear like set pieces with no depth or other means of indicating space. Munich, BSB, Clm 13002, described in more detail in chapter 3, depicts each surgery within a columned area, but again there is no other indication of architectural space. Later cautery illustrations, such as those found in Rome, Biblioteca Casanatense, MS 1382 (A.II.15) (thirteenth century), show a similar repetitive columned space, with multiple surgeries on each page and arches above each procedure. 202 See for example, the braziers in Florence, Laurenziana, Plut. 73. 41, fol. 122r; and Venice, San Marco, Ms. Lat.7.13, folio 22r.Only one other set of cautery procedures, Rome, Biblioteca Casanatense, Ms. 1382 (A.II.15), fol. 2r, include a fireplace, but it is clearly a forge for the making of the iron tools. This manuscript will be discussed in more detail below. 85 medical work.203 My argument is that the oddities provide key evidence for the meaning of the images and the function of the manuscript itself. Rather than mere copies of late antique practical medicine, the cautery images in Hunter 100 are themselves abstracted \"snapshots\" from multiple sources that not only reflect the intellectual reach of the Durham monks but also a narrative that must be uncovered through scholarly study and meditatio. Like \"scientific albums\" and Hunter 100 itself, the selected images were intentionally arranged to create webs of meaningful relationships that speak to the interests and pressing concerns of the monastery in the early twelfth century. One way to explain the artists' use of a variety of images has already been discussed--namely, the desire of the Durham monks to show the wide range of texts at their disposal and the range of their scholarly interests. Ramirez-Weaver makes this argument with regard to the Hunter 100 astronomical images, which also come from diverse stylistic traditions.204 In effect, the collection of cautery illustrations further amplifies the perception of the wealth of their library and promotes their identity as a learned monastery dedicated to scholarship. This approach, however, can only partially explain the cautery illustrations. It cannot account for the unusual architectural features of the first image, nor can it explain certain odd features of the depictions. In addition, the spare number of eight surgeries would also seemingly contradict the idea of a wealth of materials at the monastery. 203 See for example, Weitzmann, Illustrations in Roll and Codex, 96. Weitzmann uses the Hunter 100 cautery illustrations as evidence in a larger argument for the development of the illuminated codex, showing the \"emancipation of [Late Antique] column text.\" 204 Ram\u00edrez-Weaver, \"Coordinating Classical Traditions,\" 5-11. 86 Another explanation involves ideas more central to Durham's identity as recently reformed Benedictine monks. The creation of Hunter 100 occurred less than fifty years after the pre-monastic Congregation of Durham had been expelled from Durham and replaced by those who followed the monastic Rule of Benedict.205 The visual evidence for their new monastic impetus is found in the details of the first full-page cautery procedure, which is architecturally and ideologically set within a monastic and episcopal context. The elaborate two-tiered structure with arches, columns, walls, ceilings, a chair, a fireplace, and even a view of the exterior of the building emphasizes an enclosed, interior space.206 The ideological resonance of enclosure would have been clear to the newly reformed monks of Durham at a time when both their cathedral and cloister were being rebuilt to meet the needs of their new Benedictine status. Moreover, the exterior cupolas mimic those designed by Durham artists 205 The early history of Durham was recorded by Symeon of Durham between 1104-1107 in procursu istius, hoc est Dunelmensis ecclesie (Tract on the Origins and Progress of this the Church of Durham), ed. and trans. David Rollason (Oxford: Clarendon, 2000). This work establishes the origin of Durham at the monastery of Lindisfarne, in particular Lindisfarne under St. Cuthbert, whose relics had been in Durham since the tenth century. By the eleventh century, secular clerks controlled Durham and Cuthbert's relics. These clerks were expelled in 1083 by the Norman bishop, William of St. Calais (1080-1096), who replaced them with Benedictine monks from Wearmouth Jarrow. He also initiated the renovation of the cloister and cathedral and the development of the Durham library. For more on the history of Durham, see William M. Aird, St. Cuthbert and the Normans: The Church of Durham, (Woodbridge, and Rochester, Boydell Press, 1998); Symeon of Durham: Historian of Michael Prestwich (Woodbridge, UK and Rochester, NY: Boydell Press, 1994). 206 The emphasis on medical procedures appearing in an enclosed interior space begins in the thirteenth century with medical illustrations involving women. In Wien, \u00d6sterreichische Nationalbibliothek, Codex 93, fol. 38r, two female medical practitioners surround a seated female patient in the middle. As in Hunter 100, the patient sits on an ornate chair and her central importance is emphasized by the double arches that meet above her head. The treatment, as stated in the text below, involves the herb Proserpinatia, used for menstrual cramps. Here the emphasis on interior space likely relates to contemporaneous ideas of the hidden aspect of women's medical issues, particularly those involving the bearing of children. Monica Green, \"From 'Diseases of Women' to 'Secrets of Women': The Transformation of Gynecological Literature in the Later Middle Ages,\" Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies 30.1 (2000): 5-39. 87 for the hermitage of their beloved Saint Cuthbert--the abbot who supposedly imposed the Rule of St. Benedict at their mother monastery at Lindisfarne--in an illustrated, late eleventh-century manuscript of his life (figs. 70-71).207 The Vita only shows an exterior view of the hermitage, but the cupolas help to construct the idea of sacred space. The architectural features in Hunter 100 may also reflect the new monastic architecture under construction at Durham in the early twelfth century. The rebuilding of the cathedral began in 1093, but the cloister was initiated earlier in 1083 under bishop William of St. Calais to serve the needs of the new Benedictine monks.208 Architectural historians describe the introduction of interior stone vaulting rather than wooden ceilings, a feature that is depicted in the Hunter 100 illustration. Large stone fireplaces also would have been found in a typical monastic warming room (calefactorium), usually placed under dormitories, and often within monastic infirmaries.209 Indeed, it is possible that the illustration is related to the specific juxtaposition of a warming room to the infirmary at Durham. Although written in the sixteenth century, the Rites of Durham describe the passage from the cloister to the infirmary in the following manner, \"[o]n the right hand as yow goe out of ye cloysters in to ye 207 Oxford, University Library, MS 165, pages 63 and 55. 208 M.G. Snape, \"Documentary Evidence for the Building of Durham Cathedral and its Monastic Buildings,\" in Medieval Art and Architecture at Durham Cathedral, British Archaeological Association Conference Transactions for the year 1977 (London: The British Archaeological Association, 1980), 20-36. Snape quotes Symeon's history of Durham to suggest that the early cloister buildings were begun earlier by Bishop Walcher (1071-1080) who also contemplated replacing the secular clerks at Durham. Snape, 22. 209 K.W. Markuson, \"Recent Investigations in the East Range of the Cathedral Monastery, Durham,\" in Medieval Art and Architecture at Durham, 37-48, 40 and 46-47. Markuson speculates that the late eleventh and early twelfth century warming room was somewhere in the eastern range of the cloister, which also originally held the monk dormitories and possibly an early chapter house. The dormitory was later moved to the western range. 88 [infirmary] was ye comone house & a Maister thereof the house being to this end, to haue a fyre keapt in yt all wynter for ye Mounckes....\"210 In addition to the architectural resonance with monasticism, other details of the surgery itself refer to monastic discipline. Along with the cautery procedure itself, another therapeutic intervention is shown, indicated by a specific type of tool. While the doctor on the left holds a heated cautery iron to burn the patient's forehead, the younger practitioner on the right holds shears to cut his hair before the surgery (fig. 72). While there is both archeological and visual evidence of shears and therapeutic descriptions of their medical use (fig. 73), this tool is not referenced in any extant cautery text nor does it appear in any other set of cautery illustrations.211 Shears, however, would have been a common tool in monastic houses where the monks were regularly tonsured.212 They also would have had a specific meaning for the monks of Durham, for a pair was found alongside the body of St. Cuthbert upon the opening of his coffin in 1104.213 This multivalent image merges the therapeutic uses 210 The Common Howse, XLV, in Rites of Durham, Being a Description or Brief Declaration of all the Ancient Monuments, Rites, and Customs belonging or Being within the Monastical Church of Durham before the Suppression. Written 1593, ed. J.T. Fowler (Durham: Published for the Society by Andrews, 1903), 88. 211 Oribasius, in his Medical Collections, (d. 403 A.D) claims that the use of scissors on hair is also a therapeutic intervention. De medicina by Celsus (first century A.D.) mentions scissors (forfex) to cut hair before surgical operations. Shears/scissors are also noted for their surgical use in Albucasis (936-1013). John Kirkup, \"The History and Evolution of Surgical Instruments. Chapter IX: Scissors and Related Pivot-Controlled Cutting Instruments,\" Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England 80 (1998): 422-432, 422. 212 For more on the significance of hair and haircuts in the Middle Ages, see Simon Coates, \"Scissors or Sword: The Symbolism of a Medieval Haircut,\" History Today 49.5 (1999): 7-13; Robert Bartlett, \"Symbolic Meanings of Hair in the Middle Ages,\" Transactions of the Royal Historical Society 4 (1994): 43-60; and Edward James, \"Bede and the Tonsure Question,\" Peritia 3 (1984): 85-98. 213 The two openings of the coffin are described in an anonymous account ca. 1123. De miraculis et translationibus Sancti Cuthberti in Hodgson Hinde (Durham: Surtees Society, 1868), 118-197. Along with the shears, the monks found a Gospel of John, an ivory comb, a silver altar, a paten, a pectoral cross and a small chalice. See also, The Relics of St. Cuthbert, ed. C.F. Battiscombe (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1956), 103. 89 of shears in medicine and in the tonsure of monasticism. Monastic discipline is thus suggested as a complementary cure. The theme of monastic discipline as cure is also reinforced by the similarity of the two-tier composition of the Hunter 100 illustration to a decidedly English monastic image--the frontispiece to the Regularis Concordia (hereinafter Drafted in the tenth century, the RC was part of the royally sanctioned monastic reform movement in England. Similar to the context of pre-reform Durham, many of the tenth-century monasteries had been taken over by secular clerks. Archbishops Aethelwold (Winchester, d. 984) and Dunstan (Canterbury, d. 988), both of whom were later venerated as saints, above all persuaded King Edgar to sponsor the reintroduction of the Rule of St. Benedict. Like Hunter 100, the RC illustration depicts three men at the top: King Edgar in the center flanked by archbishops Aethelwold and Dunstan. Underneath, a monk somatically adopts the new discipline by wrapping himself in a scroll version of its tenets. His outstretched lunging position, perhaps here showing a form of prostration and symbolizing obedience to the rule, is comparable to that of the helper at the fireplace in Hunter 100. It is likely that a Durham artist knew of or had access to this composition. The RC illustration was copied in Canterbury in the early eleventh century, likely under Archbishop 214 London, BL, Cotton MS Tiberius A III, fol. 2v. Although the manuscript was created in Canterbury during the late eleventh century, scholars have argued convincingly that the illustration copies an original tenth-century version. See Robert Deshman, \"Benedictus Monarcha et Monachus: 22.1 (1988): 204-240. See and the English Benedictine Reform Movement: Reading London, BL, Cotton Tiberius A.iii in its Manuscript Context (Toronto: PIMS, 2015). For more on the tenth-century reform movement in England, see David Knowles, The Monastic Order in England: A History of its Development from the Time of St. Dunstan to the Fourth Lateran Council, 940-1216 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1963), 31-56. Durham was not reformed during this movement. 90 Lanfranc. Lanfranc was also charged with helping in the reform of Durham, and evidence shows that Canterbury offered manuscripts of the Benedictine rule and possibly scribes to help build their scriptorium.215 Among the extant donated manuscripts include Canterbury's Monastic Constitutions (Durham Cathedral Library, MS B.IV.24, gradual (Durham Cathedral Library, Cosin MS and likely a hymnal (London, BL, Julius MS A.vi).216 In addition, similar compositional forms to the RC frontispiece begin to appear in other late eleventh-century manuscripts from Canterbury and they also emphasize the imposition of discipline. Prefacing a text of Aelfric's grammar rules is an illustration that contains the two monastic bishops, Saints Dunstan and Aethelwold, the same two-tiered structure, and the same lunging monk (fig. 75).217 As before, the prostrating monk figuratively takes on the scholarly discipline of learning Latin.218 It is thus likely that the artist of Hunter 100 saw or at least was aware of the architectural composition and the various associative meanings. His use of a similar formal construction links the meaning of the illustration to monastic reform, discipline, and learning, but not in the way one might expect. 215 A.J. Piper, \"The Durham Cantor's Book (Durham, Anglo-Norman Durham, 79-92, 79-81. 216 Malcolm Baker, \"Medieval Illustrations of Bede's Life of St. Cuthbert,\" Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes (1978): 16-49, 19. Upon his return from exile in 1091, Bishop Calais gave other Norman books to Durham. For these and other book donations, see Alma Colk Browne, \"Bishop William of St Carilef's Book 56v (Canterbury, mid-eleventh century). The manuscript is thought to have been brought to Durham library in the fourteenth century. 218 The text on the scroll, the first half of which is illegible, is a later addition and mostly in English. I would like to thank Dr. Greti Dinkova-Bruun for her insights on this inscription. 91 In Hunter 100, the imposition of a rule or discipline does not seem to affect the figure at the fire, who appears to be handing up the cautery irons to the doctors above rather than receiving a rule from below; however, such an imposition is depicted with the patients on the following two folios and specifically appears to reference the reform of Durham. The selection of visual fragments on fols. 119v-120r offers a reenactment of the recent conversion history of the monastery--that is, the replacement of secular religious with monks and the imposition of the Rule of St. Benedict by bishop William of St.-Calais in the late eleventh century. In order to recreate this event, the Durham artists have visually referenced images of an earlier reform, that of St. Cuthbert--whose relics were then held by the Durham monks--and the abbey of Lindisfarne in the seventh century. These illustrations are found in a Life of St. Cuthbert created at Durham around 1100.219 In particular, one image shows St. Cuthbert attempting to persuade the Lindisfarne monks to adopt the Rule of St. Benedict (fig. 76). The illustration shows him teaching the Rule to the Lindisfarne monks. It was a time of strife at Lindisfarne, just after the Synod of Whitby, that called for the formerly Celtic monasteries to observe the Rule of St. Benedict, which was associated in England with the Roman church. The image illustrates chapter sixteen, where Bede describes how Cuthbert was sent to Lindisfarne to \"teach the rule of monastic perfection by his authority as prior and illustrate it by the example of his virtue (ut 219 Oxford, University College, MS 165, p. 50 (\"MS 165\"). Magdalena Elizabeth Carrasco, \"The Construction of Sanctity: Pictorial Hagiography and Monastic Reform in the First Illustrated Life of St. Cuthbert (Oxford, University College, MS 165),\" Studies in Iconography 21 (2000): 47-89, 78, fn. 9, summarizes discussions about the dating of the manuscript. there were certain brethren in the monastery who preferred to conform to their older usage rather than to the monastic rule. Nevertheless, he overcame these by his modest virtue and his patience, and by daily effort he gradually converted them to a better state of mind. In fact very often during the debates in the chapter of the brethren concerning the rule, when he was assailed by the bitter insults of his opponents, he would rise up suddenly and with calm mind and countenance would go out, thus dissolving the chapter, but nonetheless on the following day, as if he had suffered no repulse the day before, he would give the same instruction as before to the same audience until, as we have said, he gradually converted them to the things that he desired.221 In the accompanying illustration, Cuthbert is placed on the left while the other monks point in conversation and possibly anger at the loss of their ancient customs. Some even turn away from St. Cuthbert, presumably in opposition to the new Rule. Similar to Lindisfarne, late eleventh and early twelfth-century Durham also wrestled with the change from a type of secular religious life to the discipline of the Rule of St. Benedict. While most of the monks were brought in from other monasteries, the brethren of the pre-monastic Congregation were given the opportunity to accept the Rule and become 220 Two Lives of Saint Cuthbert: A Life by an Anonymous Monk of Lindisfarne and Bede's Prose Life, ed. and trans. by Bertram Colgrave (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1940), 207. 221 Colgrave, 210-211. 93 monks.222 The first four figures on folio 119v in Hunter 100 may reflect their discernment process. As in the image connected to the Life of St. Cuthbert, the composition similarly enacts a teaching/conversion situation with comparable debate among the students/religious (fig. 57). Although the mitered doctor does not reflect the holiness and humility of St. Cuthbert but rather the more exacting demeanor of the more worldly eleventh-century reforming bishop, William of St. Calais, like the discerning monks in the Life of St. Cuthbert, the doctor and the first three patients make pointing gestures as if in debate.223 Moreover, that they are engaged in discussions over accepting the discipline of monasticism is suggested by corona-like lines that appear on the partially shaved heads of the patients--presumably performed by the bishop-like doctor holding the flat-ended cautery iron he holds in his right hand. The scene changes with the final two patients on folio 119v (fig. 64). Both are bearded and wearing only a simple cloth around their waists. Marks appear not only on their heads as corona-like lines but also on their bodies. Whereas their likely source was another medical manuscript, their placement in Hunter 100, within the reform narrative of the Durham monastery, gives them other resonances. The depiction of the fourth patient with his head in his hand is reminiscent of the image of the shepherd in the Life of St. Cuthbert who is 222 The Durham reform movement began under Bishop William of St. Calais in 1083 when he brought in Benedictine monks from various other Northumbrian monasteries. The members of the Congregation were not however immediately expelled, but rather the two groups lived side by side for a period of time before they were forced to choose between the Rule and often, their families. Symeon of Durham notes that only one member of the Congregation, the decanus of the community, was persuaded to join. Aird, St. Cuthbert and the Normans, 127-139. 223 For an extensive study on medieval gestures, see Jean-Claude Schmitt, \"The Rationale of Gestures in the West: Third to the Thirteenth Centuries,\" in A Cultural History of Gesture: From Antiquity to the Present Day, eds.

The final patient on folio 119v becomes the culmination of the reform process. His hands are held outward in an orant or prayer position, a position that mimics Christ on the cross. No longer pointing in discussing, he has accepted the Rule of St. Benedict. a life of constant prayer, obedience, and internal struggles--and ultimately, salvation. Two cautery patients appear on the final folio, 120r (fig. 78) and the marks on their bodies indicate very different kinds of illness. Neither patient's head is shaved, nor do they bear tonsure-like burn marks on their foreheads. Rather, they resemble two contemptuous figures in the illustration for Book III of the Life of St. Cuthbert (fig. 79). On the left in the illustration, two men point while Cuthbert kneels in front of them, praying for the safe return of a boat manned by monks (although they don't appear as monks in the image). In the Life and Hunter 100, the first male appears as a sumptuously dressed youth with a bordered tunic and chlamys-styled cape attached by a fibula. While the figure in Hunter 100 points to his chin, the other points to his head. The second figure in both manuscripts wears an odd hat, similar to that found on the cautery patient, and both twist backward while walking in the opposite direction. The Life of St. Cuthbert text names these men as those who mocked the monastic way of jeer at [the monk's] habitual manner of life, as if they were deservedly suffering, seeing that they despised the common rules of mortals and put forth new and unknown rules of life.224 224 Colgrave, Two lives of Saint Cuthbert, 162-163. 95 In the context of Hunter 100, on one level of interpretation, these patients represent the secular religious who left Durham, unable to accept the Rule of St. Benedict, and the Durham artists have intentionally isolated them from the monks struggling with monastic discipline on the opposite page.225 In addition to rejecting the monastic way of life, the final patient in the cautery section also appears to walk away from the figure on his right. Unlike his model in the Life of St. Cuthbert, the Hunter 100 figure fails to point--that is, to engage in the dialogue of learning or to consider conversion to the Rule--and his arms are in the inverse position of the orant. They turn in towards his own lower torso. The cautery marks on his abdomen can be likened to those that indicate the sickness of the lungs (the breath or spirit) and the heart (will, or love) and represent the physical and moral diseases most fatal for a monk and monastic discipline.226 As will be discussed below, the final patient also curiously resembles the figure at the fire on the first page of cautery illustrations. Accordingly, the depraved depiction of the final patient offers a gloss and an alternative explanation for the medical helper at the fire. 225 The disease suffered by this patient has associations that are discussed in the next two chapters. In both of those cases, the illness depicted, a disease of the gums, is likened to the sin of Stephaton, the Roman soldier who gave spoiled wine to Christ on the Cross and who never atones for his actions. His sin is unredeemable. For more on Stephaton in the Middle Ages, see William Chester Jordan, \"The Last Tormentor of Christ: An Image of the Jew in Ancient and Medieval Exegesis, Art, and Drama,\" The Jewish Quarterly Review 78.1/2 (1987): 21-47. 226 See Appendix B for patient's cautery marks. 96 1.3b Cautery, Metalwork, and the Devil If the final patient in the manuscript can be allegorically construed as a fallen monk, the interpretation of his counterpart--the figure at the fire--is called into question. At face value, his role seems to be that of a medical helper or apprentice heating cautery irons for the use of the doctors above (fig. 80). As such, an allegorical interpretation would construe his role as facilitating monastic discipline and the conversion of the monastery to the Rule of St. Benedict. Yet a comparative study of his depiction to contemporary cautery illustrations suggests something different. Rather than a medical role, the depiction of the figure by the fire alludes to the craft of metalworking and the ambivalent (and potentially malevolent) connotations this conveyed. As mentioned above, helpers in cautery illustrations are most frequently portrayed as a youthful man handing irons to a doctor from a small brazier rather than a fireplace. The assistant and the doctor usually occupy the same room and both are fully dressed. There is one set of cautery illustrations from the late thirteenth century, however, that does employ a fireplace. Moreover, it explicitly links the helper's role to the craft of metalworking. At the top right of the first folio of cautery images in Rome, Biblioteca Casanatense, MS 1382 (A.II.15), folio (hereafter \"Rome 1382\"), a figure identified as a discipulus stands in front of a roaring fireplace holding tongs in his right hand while his left pulls a rope that operates the bellows at the back (fig. 81). 227 This indicates that the fireplace served as a forge for heating iron and creating metal tools. Indeed, there is an anvil placed behind the helper that 227 The manuscript has been reproduced in facsimile. See Rolandus (Parmensis), La chirurgia: Riproduzione del Codice Latino ed. Giovanni Carbonelli (Rome: Istituto Nazionale Medico Farmacologico, 1927). The image of Hippocrates and the helper at the fire is placed at the top of eight cautery procedures, all of which appear under arches. Rolandus Parmensis's (ca. 1198-ca. 1280) work, Chirurgia, accompanies the illustrations. 97 likely would have been for his use in creating the iron rods utilized in cautery. The image in Hunter 100 has some of the same features as Rome 1382: a fireplace with a large, rounded hood, multiple cautery irons, and a helper visually identified as lower in status than the doctors. While there is no anvil or bellows, the helper's partially undressed and muscular body perhaps signifies the heat emerging from the fireplace and the arduous labor required in metalworking. There is, however, one important difference between the two images that raises questions about the moral character of the figure in Hunter 100. In Rome 1382, only the much larger doctor, labeled Hippocrates, holds cautery irons, which have been placed in front of him and within a brazier\u2014the usual instrument for heating such tools in a medical context. The process of making the tools has been spatially separated, and there is no interaction between their fabrication and use in medicine. In other words, the fabricator and the doctor have their own area of expertise: while the helper/metalworker crafts the iron tools, it remains for the doctor to choose which instrument to apply for the particular situation. Only the doctor has the requisite knowledge of which tools will be helpful\u2014will effect the desired cure\u2014and which would be harmful. In Hunter 100, their realms of expertise intersect for the helper/metalworker directly hands the crafted cautery iron to the doctor. Even more, his choice of curing instrument is different from what the doctor holds in his hand. The circular tip of the iron used to cure the patient contrasts with the flat edge of the tool held by the helper at the fire. Perhaps the doctor has judged the latter to be an instrument of harm rather than cure. In fact, the figure of the metalworker in medieval England carried connotations that were both malicious and beneficial. The Anglo-Saxon medical text, the Lacnunga (\"Pagan Lay Against Elfshot\"), contains medical treatments that include iron work as part of the 98 malady as well as the cure.228 The text names the spears and darts created by metalworkers as agents of disease and also other tools used for healing. In other accounts, the metalworker is described as a person particularly vulnerable to diabolic influence. Bede describes a blacksmith who was condemned to the fires of hell for being too attentive to the fires of his forge and prideful of the power of creation it afforded him.229 Conversely, within a monastic context, the blacksmith tended to have a more favorable view. St. Eligius was a seventh-century monk famous for his skill in metalworking and a twelfth-century work, De diversis artibus, describes the sacred dimension of metalwork when practiced by monks.230 It was also a common metaphor to compare the practice of monasticism with the labor of metalworking. According to Hilary Powell, \"the monk was analogous to the blacksmith, his cell was the forge and his prayers\u2014the product of monastic labor\u2014were the crafted objects 228 \"Loud were they, yea loud, when they rode over the hill; Fierce were they, when they rode over the land. Shield thou thee now: then mayest thou survive this onset. Out little spear, if herein thou be.... And the whizzing darts they sent. I back to them will send another, A flying shaft in defence against them. Out, little spear, if herein it be; Sat a smith, a knife he sledged, Small the iron, woeful the wound. Out, little spear, if herein it be....\" Lacnunga, Section 135 (Pagan Lay Against Elfshot), in J.H.G. Grattan and Charles Singer, Anglo-Saxon Magic and Medicine: Illustrated Specifically from the Semi-Pagan Text \"Lacnunga\" (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1952), 174-5. Blacksmiths, that is those metalworkers who work with iron, are depicted as both crafting the metal darts that cause illness (the prayer repeats the phrase \"out, little spear\") and curing the same by the creation of other metal object that remove the embedded irons. See also Warren Tormey, \"Magical (and Maligned) Metalworkers: Understanding Representations of Early and High Medieval Blacksmiths,\" in Magic and Magicians in the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Time: The Occult in Pre-Modern Sciences, Medicine, Religion, and Astrology, (Berlin 229 Bede, Bede's Ecclesiastical History of Roger Aubrey Baskerville 127-129. 230 De diversis artibus, ch. 3. See Heidi C. Gearhart, Theophilus and the Theory and Practice of Medieval Art (University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 2017), 67-88. 99 wrought by the smith.\"231 The discipline of monasticism was seen as a protective force, providing the \"armaments\" necessary for the monk/metalworker to defend himself against demonic attack. The ideas of the monastic cell, metalworking, and demonic attack come together in a very popular episode in the Life of St. Dunstan and these features are reflected in the first cautery illustration in Hunter 100.232 The scene is first described in a version of the Life written in the late eleventh century, a copy of which was created by the Durham scriptorium around 1100.233 The event takes place just after Dunstan embarks on his monastic life. His chosen manual labour, required by the Rule of St. Benedict, was metalworking and the story begins with Dunstan in his small cell surrounded by a forge and metalworking tools, deeply engaged in his work. All of a sudden, a devil appears outside his small window and distracts him with visions of women (mulierum nomina) and luxuries or lust (luxurias). Realizing his predicament, Dunstan uses the only tools at his disposal to fight against such an attack. 231 Hilary Powell, \"Demonic Daydreams: Mind-Wandering and Mental Imagery in Medieval Hagiography of St. Dunstan,\" New Medieval Literatures 18 (2018): 44-74, 52. 232 A description of the scene first appears in a late eleventh-century hagiographical account of Dunstan's Canterbury, ed. William Stubbs, Rolls Series 63 (London: Longman, 1874), 69-128. For more information on Osbern, see Jay Rubenstein, \"The Life and Writings of Osbern of Canterbury, in Canterbury and the Norman Conquest: Churches, Saints and Scholars, 1066-1109, ed. Richard Eales and Richard Sharpe, (London: Hambledon Press, 1995), 27-40. It was Osbern's Vita that first portrayed Dunstan as the leader of the tenth-century Benedictine reform movement in England. It was likely created at the behest of Archbishop Lanfranc, who was instrumental in the reform of Canterbury and in building the cult of St. Dunstan. The Life shows how Dunstan twice aids Lanfranc to promote monastic discipline at the monastery. Nigel Ramsay and Margaret Sparks, \"The Cult of St Dunstan at Christ Church, Canterbury,\" in St. Dunstan: His Life, Times and Cult, eds. Nigel Ramsay, Margaret Sparks, and T.W.T. Tatton-Brown (Woodbridge, UK and Rochester, NY: Boydell Press, 1992), 315. For the most recent study on the twelfth-century lives of St. Dunstan, see et miracula iste.\" He boldly made the tool with which he held the iron red hot, calling on Christ through compressed lips. And when he saw the end of the tool glowing bright white, driven by pious rage, he rapidly drew them from the fire, grabbed the devilish face with the tongs and with his whole strength dragged the struggling monster inside. Now standing firm Dunstan gained strength, while he who was being held tore apart the imprisoning walls with his own hands and fled with a great roar, howling in rage: \"Oh what has this bald man done! Oh what has this bald man done.234 The idea that the monastic vocation itself involved an armed struggle against sinful thoughts personified as the devil goes back to the earliest hagiographical texts.235 Yet Dunstan's particular choice of weapon is unique and essential for understanding the illustration in Hunter 100, for Dunstan's method of maintaining monastic discipline was to allegorically burn the personified temptation on his head with the two ends of a burning hot iron tool.236 234 The Early Lives of St. Dunstan, eds. Michael Winterbottom and Michael Lapidge (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2012). 235 In his Life of St. Antony, Athanasius describes the eremitic monk as plagued by devils. This formula for distracting or sinful thoughts was repeated in later Western hagiography. The Life of Antony, trans. Tim Vivian and Apostolos N. Athanassakis (Kalamazoo, MI: Cistercian Cautery texts also mention the \"white-hot\" (candenti ferro) (Let us now first say how the surgeon burns with the white-hot iron because of a headache).\" While no illustrations of this scene survive in copies of Osbern of Canterbury's Life of St. Dunstan, images do appear within an early twelfth-century Life of St. Dunstan written by another Canterbury monk, Eadmer. \"Vita S. Dunstanus,\"in Eadmer of Canterbury: Lives and Miracles of Saints Oda, Dunstan, and Oswald, eds. and trans. Andrew J. Turner and Bernard J. Muir (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2006), 41-159. Eadmer's description of Dunstan's confrontation with the devil is different than Osbern's. For example, he describes Dunstan as tweaking the nose of the devil with the tongs rather than grabbing his face. A depiction of Eadmer's version along with the nose tweaking appears in a large historiated initial in London, BL, Harley MS 315, fol. 15v (Canterbury, after c. 1123). 101 While the illustration in Hunter 100 does not replicate this story, there are enough references to the Dunstan episode to argue that Hunter 100 also conflates cautery procedures with the enforcement of monastic discipline and a wandering mind. Moreover, the hagiographical story helps to explicate the role of the figure at the fire. The episode in Dunstan's Vitae informs Hunter 100's first cautery illustration in multiple ways. Like the patient in Hunter 100, Dunstan is described as inside the monastic enclosure. The holding tool (tenacula) that he uses to grab (includit) and burn the devil of distraction was most likely blacksmithing tongs, which would of course make two burn marks on the devil's face (faciem). The same number and placement appear on the patient in Hunter 100's fol. 119r who, like Dunstan, as the Devil loudly proclaims, is bald. This number and placement of marks also occur on all of the \"monastic\" patients on folio 119v. It is important to note that no earlier or contemporaneous cautery illustration for diseases of the head show a patient with a fully shaved head (figs. 82-84), and all other cautery treatments for head diseases in Hunter 100 itself only show patients with partially shaved heads (fig. 57).237 The artists of Hunter 100 appear to have purposely chosen this feature in order to allude to St. Dunstan and the disease of a distracted mind that has lost its proper focus on God. While the story of St. Dunstan would seem to allow the figure at the fire to be interpreted as a helper who aids the doctors and the monks in the establishment of monastic discipline, it also suggests a diabolical motive. In the hagiographical account, the devil 237 See, for example, Florence, Laurenziana, MS 73.41, fols. 125v fol. 2r. Shaved heads do appear in later cautery illustrations, see for example Munich, BSB, Clm 13002, fol. 1v, created over fifty years later, ca. 1165. 102 clearly stands outside Dunstan's hermitage when he tempts the saint, and in Hunter 100 the figure by the fire is also given a space separated from the patient and doctors above. The irons that the figure by the fire holds, to reiterate, have a different tip than those used by the doctors to cure the patient. Instead of instruments of healing, they could be the darts of disease referenced in the Lacnunga or even the \"fiery darts\" of the devil described in the Life of St. Cuthbert, with flames that the saint was able to extinguish.238 The large fireplace in Hunter 100 could also be conceived of as a mouth of Hell, an image often represented during this period (fig. 85), and the form of the figure's hat as a flame symbolizing the fires of Hell rather than the righteous flame of the mind focused on God. Indeed, the figure at the fire is clearly and powerfully acting from below--a space aligned with Hell--and his actions follow the inverse trajectory of the RC where the rule for monks is composed by the individuals at the top and enforced upon the monk at the bottom. In this interpretation, the figure by the fire inverts the hierarchy and actively sends the flames of temptation, the antithesis of the Rule, upward.239 238 (but when the soldier of Christ entered [the island of Farne], armed with the 'helmet of salvation, the shield of faith, and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God, all the fiery darts of the wicked one' were quenched, and the wicked foe himself was driven far away together with the whole crowd of satellites), quoting Ephesians 6:16. Bede, Vita Prosaica, 14, in Colgrave, Two Lives, 214-215. 239 Most medieval illustrations show something given from above, for example the blessing of the hand of God in London, BL, Arundel MS 60, fol. 12v (1060-1080, Winchester) and God presenting the Ten Commandments in Durham Cathedral Library, MS B II 13, fol. 181v, (late eleventh century, Durham). 103 1.3c Fire, the Enflamed Hat, and the Will Whether the figure by the fire is merely a medical helper, a creator of metal tools without knowledge of cure, or an active demonic influence can be further elucidated by considering the aspect and form of fire as it is presented in Hunter 100. As mentioned above, no fire appears in the fireplace to which the figure/metalworker holds his iron tools. Instead, the only image that could be construed as fire appear on the figure's hat, which looks like a single flame.240 The enflamed hat not only appears twice in the cautery illustrations, but it also recurs three other times in the images of the constellations and planets. In all five cases, the artists are playing with notions of fire--the fire of the passions, the spiritual fire of the saints, and fire's relationship to the human will. Medieval thought contains multiple, often paradoxical, significations for fire--at times as base human passions, Hell, or the devil and other times to the Holy Spirit or the passions of a saint. St. Cuthbert is able to miraculously put out a diabolical fire that threatened a village and to \"extinguish the fiery darts of the wicked one.\" According to Bede, with reference to Isaiah 43:2, the saint can walk through the fire and not be burnt.241 The Gospel of Luke describes fire as a form of charity or love: \"I have come to cast fire upon the earth and what will I but that it be kindled\" (12:49). The passage suggests a different kind of metaphorical fire, that of the \"love of our Saviour\" or of faith. The scribes of Hunter 100 included a statement on the fiery personality, claiming that these persons \"with 240 This form is also repeated on the top of the fireplace, perhaps to further signify its function. 241 Colgrave, Two Lives of St. Cuthbert, 202-203. 104 the fiery virtue are dominated by the superior parts of of fire when he describes the intentio animi, or the will, a fiery substance likened to the Holy Spirit.243 While he uses different metaphors to explain its nature, in general the will has two components: desire--likened to fire, which could be strong or weak--and volition, which is functionally the decision to commit to a particular course of action. He also describes volition physically as a type of directionality, for it is often expressed in such terms as advertens, or turning toward.244 In fact, Augustine likened the will to a bow and arrow that requires power or force and must also be directed at a specific target.245 In the Life of St. Dunstan, the author Osbern uses the terms \"animum intendit\" to explain Dunstan's mental processes of attention and distraction. Before the appearance of the devil, Dunstan's mind was focused on his metalworking, or more literally, he \"extend[ed] his mind\" (animum intendit) to his monastic labour, which for Osbern was the equivalent to focusing on God.246 Initially, Dunstan refuses to turn toward (advertens) the devil's 242 The statement appears in the second text focused on the four humours. 243 Powell, \"Demonic Daydreams,\" 470 and 471. In De trinitate (11.2.2), Augustine describes the intentio anime as having a role in sense perception. It is the force which activates the sense organs and keeps them focused on the object to be perceived. Ultimately, for Augustine, role of the intentio was to enable fallen humanity to refocus their mind on God and achieve salvation. Margaret Enid Lane, \"The Role of Intentio in Augustine's Understanding of the Soul's Ascent to God: From de animae quantitate to de trinitate,\" Ph.D. Dissertation, of 77. 245 Psalmos 77:34 and 17:35. 246 Powell, \"Demonic Daydreams,\" 49. 105 temptations, but like all fallen humans he could not stop the thoughts from entering his mind and had to battle against them. His method of defeating the diabolical thoughts was, first, to turn towards God \"calling on Christ through compressed lips\" (suppressis uses his \"whole strength\" (totis viribus) to burn the devil using red hot tools from the fire. In Hunter 100, the enflamed hat, fundamentally related to the fire, also signals the will. It appears three times in the astronomical images--on Mars, Perseus, and Sagittarius--and in each case signals a strong-willed personality. In the case of Mars, the associated text emphasizes his passion--surely kindled for war or Aphrodite rather than for God--by describing him as red (rubeus) and fiery (igneus) (fol. 64v).247 While only the \"superior parts\" of Mars are depicted in Hunter 100 (fig. 86), the other two figures are shown in action and the details of the depictions raise questions as to the appropriateness of the target to which their will is directed. 247 Mars non tante magnitudinis suum complet (Mars is not as large as Jupiter but appears larger than foeton [Phaeton]. Its colour is red or even fiery. It completes an orbit in two years). Note that other medieval authors use similar, but not the same, terms to identify Mars. In the Enchiridion 2.3.228, Byrhtferth describes Mars as a quick person (scyndles). Bede calls the planet fervent (feruens) and burning (ardore). De temporum ratione, 8.45 and 8.47, as cited in Nicole Guenther Discenza, Inhabited Spaces: Anglo-Saxon Constructions of Place (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2017), 43. The Ps.-Hyginus myth of Mars is focused on his illicit affair with Venus. De astronomia, 2.1328-1334, in Hygini De astronomia, ed. Ghislaine Vir\u00e9 1992). For a translated version of the Ps.-Hyginus myths, see The Myths of Hyginus, trans. and ed. by Mary Grant (Lawrence: University of Kansas Press, 1960). I have labelled this figure as Mars, however there is no identifying inscription and other scholars have given him different labels. Lippincot, \"Durham Cathedral Library Hunter 100: ps.-Bede. De signis caeli,\" The Saxl Project, at https://www.thesaxlproject.com/assets/Uploads/MSS-descriptions-Durham-Hunter-100-ps-Bede-De-Signis-caeli-12-Nov-2012.pdf, suggests that he is Apollo and calls the hat a crested helmet. Mars, however, is the more likely candidate. The associated text in Hunter 100 places Mars third of five planets--so in the middle and the same position in which he is depicted in the illustration. Moreover, other manuscripts with identifying texts, such as Cotton MS Tiberius B.V.1, fol. 44v (England, eleventh century), also place Mars in the central position. 106 Perseus is depicted in battle holding a sword and the head of Medusa as a shield, with the enflamed hat acting as a helmet (fig. 87).248 Perseus's struggle, unfortunately, involves unintended casualties, for he does not focus on the sword in his left hand behind him and it accidently scrapes the flesh of the swan, cignus. On the other hand, Sagittarius is focused and his target, the word \"capite\" (the head) is intentional (fig. 50). He is depicted with his left hand in front of him holding a raised bow and the right behind but pointing towards the just-released arrow. Indeed, Augustine uses this weapon, the bow and an arrow, as a metaphor for the focused will. Sagittarius's action, while harmful, may be potentially construed as a type of cure or at least a correction. Greek myths describe Orion as equally enflamed but only for lust and destruction.249 Indeed, Orion is the only other constellation in Hunter 100 that bears arms, but he is not adorned by the Durham artists with an enflamed hat nor is he focused on a target. Orion's right hand, held before him, is covered by his cape, and his left holds a weapon behind him. The depiction seems to imply that Orion's focus is not on his unseen hands, and as a result they only perform harmful deeds (fig. 88). In the context of Hunter 100, Sagittarius acts to discipline the deranged mind of Orion and a later monastic viewer attempted to render Orion harmless by erasing his weapon. 248 His representations often show him carrying a Vulcan-made knife and wearing winged hat that offers invisibility. See for example, Oxford, Bodleian, MS. Bodley 614, fol. 26v. This hat likely influenced the one given to the figure by the fire. Note that St. Cuthbert himself is similarly described in battle gear just as he goes out to attack the demons on the island of Farne. According to Bede, he is a \"solider of Christ...armed with a helmet of salvation, the shield of faith and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God.\" Colgrave, \"Two Lives Cicero's Latin translation deranged (errans, story, see Ps.-Hyginus, 2.21. For his conception story, see Ps.-Hyginus, Fabulae, 195 and De astronomica, 2.34. 107 The depiction of a centaur with an enflamed hat later became deeply linked to monastic discipline at Durham. At Durham, the centaur appears in a late twelfth-century sculpted capital in the chapter house (fig. 89). In general, references to centaurs are complicated. In the minds of the monks, any hybridity, but most clearly combinations with animals, would signal the predominance of the beastly or immoral part of the soul.250 Yet, at the same time, centaurs were known for their wisdom and intelligence. In fact, they were historically linked to the transmission of medical knowledge. An eleventh-century manuscript created in England depicts a centaur handing down medical learning to Plato (fig. 90).251 For monks, who as part of their monastic discipline struggled to overcome their own animal-like nature and to focus their mind on God, the centaur could be an important model. Its placement in the chapter house is significant, for it is a place associated with the daily recitation of the Rule of St. Benedict and reminded the monks of their vows and goals and the disciplined mind and focused will required to achieve them. The final cautery patient in Hunter 100 lacks such a focused will and disciplined mind and therefore leaves the monastery. His depiction shows a disjointed attention--his body walks to the left while his head turns back--and his hands, which are placed on his lower abdomen, signals that his focus remains on the carnal rather than the divine. The depiction of the figure at the fire is more complicated. Like the monk in the RC, he looks up toward the 250 See Thomas E.A. Dale, \"Monsters, Corporeal Deformities, and Phantasms in Art (early eleventh century, Canterbury?). This full-page appears before the herbal texts, De herba vettonica liber, the Herbarius, and the Medicina de quadrupedibus which are discussed in the following chapter. It depicts \"Escolapius\" on the left, \"Plato\" in the middle and \"centaurus\" on the right. The three figures are surrounded by the plants and animals used for medications, knowledge of which is presumably contained in the book. For more on this manuscript, see Linda Ehrsam Voigts, \"A New Look at a Manuscript Containing the Old English Translation of the Herbarium Apulei,\" Manuscripta 20.1 (1976): 40-60. 108 him; however, while the RC monk's hands envelope the text of the Benedictine Rule, the figure at the fire's hands hold iron rods, one of which is unseen. His mind does not solely focus on God and, like Perseus, the figure at the fire may cause harm. 1.3d Cautery and the Desire for a Monastic Bishop In one sense, the depiction of the figure at the fire serves as a warning to all Durham monks to keep their mind focused on God and their hands busy with divine work. Yet the figure in another sense may relate to a specific person, namely, their non-monastic abbot and bishop, Ranulf Flambard (bishop 1099-1128). The desire of the Durham monks for a monastic bishop and abbot during this period has been well documented. According to A.J. Piper, Symeon's History of Durham, written about the same time as Hunter 100, stresses not only the monastic rigour of their former abbot and bishop St. Cuthbert, relics of whom the monastery held, but also the tradition of monastic bishops up until the time of the Norman Conquest.252 William Aird links the History as well as the new hagiographical materials on St. Cuthbert to the time when Flambard became bishop.253 \"There are signs that the attentions of this notoriously rapacious bishop inculcated in the hitherto unmolested Convent of Durham a sense of institutional and proprietorial insecurity which they sought to assuage through a corporate assertion of their rights, and a statement of their view of the way in 252 A.J. Piper, \"The First Generation of Durham Monks and the Cult of St Cuthbert,\" in St Cuthbert: His Cult and His Community to AD 1200, eds. Gerald Bonner, David Rollason, and Clare Stancliffe (Woodbridge, UK and Wolfeboro, 1989), 437-446, 442. 253 William Political Context of the Libellus de Exordio,\" in Symeon of Durham: Historian of Durham the ed. David Rollason (Stamford, UK: Shaun Tyas, 1998), 32-45. 109 which their bishop, as the spiritual heir of St Cuthbert, was expected to behave.\"254 The tradition of a monk as both abbot and bishop would strengthen the legitimacy of the new Benedictine monks at Durham as worthy inheritors of the relics of St. Cuthbert. In addition, a monastic bishop and abbot would protect their economic interests and act as a better guide for their salvation.255 In Hunter 100, the desire for a monastic bishop and abbot is manifested visually. Many of the manuscript's depictions are related to images found in an illustrated Life of St. Cuthbert\u2014also a monastic abbot and bishop\u2014that had been created at Durham only a few years before Hunter 100. In addition, the first cautery illustration alludes to a bishop's chair and more specifically to the RC, instituted by two reforming Benedictine bishops who were also abbots and monks. The singling out of St. Dunstan is also important. His feast day is highlighted by an illustration of the martyrs Pudentiana and her sister Praxedes. As noted above, these female martyrs are depicted as the Gemini twins, one of whom points to the feast day entry that they share with St. Dunstan (fig. 32). The link between Dunstan and the two female saints likely serves to emphasize the abbot-bishop's chastity and discipline. On one level, this connection was important to the identity of the Durham monks who sought to demonstrate that they would be better caretakers of their own Saint Cuthbert than members of the Congregation of Durham. Many of those had been married and fathered children before being ousted and replaced by monks who followed the vow of chastity and poverty in 254 Aird, 42. 255 Carrasco, \"The Construction of Sanctity,\" 48. See also Aird, St. Cuthbert and the Normans, 138-141. 110 the Rule of St. Benedict. It may also offer a subtle reprimand to Bishop Flambard, who had a known lover.256 In addition, the life of Dunstan has parallels to that of Flambard. Dunstan's early life in the circle of various kings of England was not unlike that of Flambard. Both began as secular clerks, gained royal recognition for their intelligence and hard work and both eventually fell out of favor and were forced into exile.257 It was during his exile that Dunstan chose to undertake the discipline of monasticism. Highlighting Dunstan in Hunter 100 suggests that Flambard, like him, could also have a conversion experience and become the monastic bishop and abbot that the Durham monks so desired. Osbern's Life of St. Dunstan is the earliest Anglo-Norman hagiographical text to also present Dunstan's conversion experience and later sainthood in the language of will and choice rather than as a preordained holy life directed by the grace of God.258 Perhaps Flambard could not only take on monastic vows but also become like the reforming leaders in English Benedictine history. 256 Robert I. Moore, \"Ranulf Flambard and Christina of Markyate,\" in Belief and Culture in the Middle Ages: Studies Presented to Henry Mayr-Harting, eds. Richard Gameson and Henrietta Leyser (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), Flambard, Southern, in Medieval Humanism and Other Studies (New York: Harper & Row, 1970), 183-205. For a general biography of Dunstan and his later reception, see St. Dunstan: His Life, Times and Cult, eds. Nigel Ramsay, Margaret Sparks, Tim Tatton-Brown (Woodbridge, UK: Boydell Press, 1992). 258 Katherine O'Brien O'Keefe, Stealing Obedience: Narrative of Agency and Identity in Later Anglo-Saxon England (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2012), esp. 54-89. Osbern's interest in freedom of the will likely developed when he was sent to the Abbey of Bec and became a student under Anselm. One of Anselm's philosophical enquiries involved Augustine's notions of freedom of choice. 111 One other possibility to consider is that the depiction of the figure at the fire directly references Bishop Flambard himself.259 The derivation of Ranulf's nickname, \"Flambard\" means flame or torch bearer. According to the early twelfth-century chronicler Orderic Vitalis, the moniker was given to Ranulf while he was in the employ of the king, due to a fiery personality that was \"too addicted to feasts and carousals and lusts.\"260 The illustration in Hunter 100 shows a man holding a burning hot iron - like a torch bearer\u2014and his depiction is intimately associated with the fireplace. The Durham artists have portrayed him looking upward and appearing to help but also internally divided, with one hand rising above and the other in the fireplace. The question that the image seems to pose is this: will he turn his fiery will to God and thereby help the monks at Durham or will he retain a divided focus and harm them?261 259 This allusion would support the recent suggestion that Hunter 100 was made as a gift to the community's outgoing monastic prior, Turgot--a figure beloved by the monastery and who all but acted as abbot in the community while abbot/bishop Flambard was away. It was Turgot who shepherded the brothers through the rebuilding of the monastery and presided over the opening and public examination of the relics of St. Cuthbert in 1104. Turgot served as prior from 1087 to 1107 when he became the bishop of St. Andrew's in Scotland, a post that may have been engineered by Flambard. Perhaps the polysemous depiction of the mitered doctor on the following page, already suggesting St. Cuthbert and Bishop St. Calais, may also allude to Turgot, now bishop, and his role at Durham. For more on Turgot, see Lionel Green, Building St. Cuthbert's Shrine: Durham Cathedral the Life of Sacristy Press, 2013); William M. Aird, \"The The \"Turgot, Prior of Durham,\" Journal of the British Archaeological Association 13.1 (1907): 32-40. 260 Historia ecclesiastica, in The Ecclesiastical History Chibnall (Oxford: Press, 1968-80), 4:170-73; quoted in Ralph V. Turner, \"Changing Perceptions of the New Administrative Class in Anglo-Norman and Angevin England: The Curiales and Their Conservative Critics,\" Journal of British Studies 29 (1990): 93-117, 107. For his quasi-marital union with Alveva, the resulting children, and his attempted seduction of the later recluse, Christina of Markyate, see Moore, \"Ranulf Flambard and Christina of Markyate,\" 231-235. 261 The view that Flambard actively tempted the monks to violate their monastic discipline was indeed an accusation later made against him by William of Malmesbury. According to the chronicler, Flambard forced his monks to eat food forbidden by the rule and to be served by women. Quid quod Cautery as Coda In this chapter, I have examined the cautery illustrations in Hunter 100 within the manuscript and monastic contexts in which they were conceived. The four-part codicological structure of the manuscript, a number that reflects the harmonies of the Christian universe, allowed for a unique arrangement in which the two medical booklets bookended the computus booklets. The Durham monks organized the contents so that the two halves of the manuscript could both mirror each other while also maintaining their own characters. The thematic focus of the first centers on the body and time as part of the complex and harmonious universe made by God and the scholarly studies and corrective actions required to understand and emend it. The second offers additional studies of time, the body, and the universe, but with works that focus more on changes of humours that cause disease, the movements of celestial bodies, and physical violence--at times a form of correction, but other times more ambiguous. The cautery illustrations, placed at the end of Hunter 100, are indeed part of the second half of the manuscript, but rather than solely reflecting the themes contained in this part, they act as a type of coda for the manuscript as a whole, interweaving crinibus (What too of the fact that he more than once made monks--against their will of course, for they are most religious persons-- dine in his hall, serving up forbidden food to them in public? And, to outrage their scruples still further, he would instruct very pretty girls of pert figure and face to serve their drinks, in skin-tight clothes and with their hair loose down their backs). William of Malmesbury, De Gestis The History of the English Bishops, Vol.1: Text and Translation, ed. M. Winterbottom (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2007), 417-418. The accusations against Flambard were not only moral but also economic. William Aird describes Flambard's exploitation of the revenues of the abbey before his bishopric and his taking of their lands once elevated to the position. William M. Aird, \"The Making of a Medieval Miracle Collection: The 28.1 (1992): 1-24, 17. 113 themes that run throughout the work. The illustrations evoke the broad conceptions of medicine, disease and cure discussed by Isidore of Seville in the first medical booklet by conflating physical illness with moral sickness and the painful cure of the cautery with the arduous spiritual and scholarly discipline of a monk under the Rule of St. Benedict. The cautery illustrations also weave in aspects of time. Like the annals of Durham placed in the first half of the manuscript, the cautery illustrations reflect on the history of the community. Indeed, the illustrations make present the seventh-century Benedictine reform of the abbey of Lindisfarne under the abbot and bishop, St. Cuthbert, whose relics lay at Durham, as well as their own recent reform under bishop William of St. Calais. They also represent the monastery's current situation under their non-monastic abbot and bishop, Ranulf Flambard. The cautery illustrations are also concerned with who might have the requisite knowledge to act as medicus to the monastery. The Ambrosian text in the first half of the manuscript distinguishes the \"hands\" of the (true) doctor which make what is harmful into a curing agent. The Durham artists have provided visual examples of hands with healing remedies in the first part of the manuscript: the leaf signifying the martyrdom of the Gemini twins, the scepter of Virgo as Virgin Mary, the scales of justice and wood of the True Cross held by Libra, and finally, in the cautery images, the iron rod and shears held by the true doctors of the monastery. The artists have also shown hands with more questionable expertise (or focus) in the second half of the manuscript: Perseus whose inattention causes harm, Sagittarius whose \"cure\" is rather a violent punishment, and, most important, the figure on folio 119v who inattentively hands cautery rods to the doctors above. These associations imply that just as the human body will suffer harm if left in the care of those who are ignorant of medicine or are ill-intentioned, so too will a monastic community suffer harm if entrusted to one who is inattentive and undisciplined in the Rule. 114 The position of the cautery illustrations in Hunter 100 at the very end of the manuscript mimics the prescription for cautery of the great physician Hippocrates, which he recommends only as a final solution. \"[T]hose diseases which medicines do not cure are cured by the knife. Those that the knife does not cure are cured by the fire [of cautery]. Those that the fire does not cure must be considered incurable.\"262 Surgery and cautery were painful procedures and only considered as a last resort. Likewise, in Hunter 100, after many pages of salves, ointments, and poultices for the exterior of the bodies and of medications consumed internally, the monks of the Durham scriptorium placed eight images of cautery procedures in the final position of the manuscript. The doctors on the first page of these illustrations offer the two \"knives\" of the scissors to enact the tonsure that initiates monastic life, along with the \"fire\" of its discipline that can ultimately restore health. The monks could only hope that Flambard would heed this message, learn the monastic discipline, and so become an agent of healing rather than of harm. 262 Aphorisms, VII.87, in Hippocrates, Volume I, trans. by W.H.S. Jones (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2014), 217. This aphorism is also the final one in Hippocrates's work. 115 Chapter Two The Suffering Body: Sickness, Sin, Cure, and Salvation London, British Library, Harley MS 1585 2.1 Introduction The twelfth-century manuscript that survives today as London, BL, Harley MS 1585 (\"Harley 1585\") is largely known as a collection of materia medica. It contains a substantial number of late antique and early medieval texts that describe the various plants and animals used to concoct remedies for bodily ailments.263 These medical materials in Harley 1585 are an example of what modern scholars have identified as the Pseudo-Apuleius Complex\u2014a collection of writings that center on the Herbarium, an herbal treatise attributed to Apuleius Platonicus that was widely copied in the early Middle Ages.264 An important feature of the Complex is that it often includes illustrations depicting the plants and animals used in pharmaceutical remedies. By the twelfth century, such texts also contained images of mythical creatures and Greek gods associated with providing knowledge of certain medical 263 Harley is included in all major studies of medieval medical manuscript illustrations. Peter Murray Jones, Medieval Medical Miniatures (London: The British Library in association with the Wellcome Institue for the History of Medicine, 1984); John E. Murdoch, Album of Science: Antiquity and the Middle Ages (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1984); and Loren MacKinney, Medical Illustrations in Medieval Manuscripts (London: Wellcome Historical Medical Library, 1965 and Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1965). 264 In the 1920's, Ernest Howald and Henry Sigerist located more than sixty surviving medieval codices or fragments of the Complex and Monica Green has recently identified thirteen copies from the twelfth century alone. Howald and Sigerist, Corpus Medicorum Latinorum, x-xvii; Monica Green, \"Medical Books,\" in The European Book in the Twelfth Century, ed. Erik Kwakkel and Rodney Thomson (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018), 277-292. For the most recent study of the herbal tradition, see Minta Collins, Medieval Herbals: The Illustrative Traditions (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2000). See also Charles Singer \"The Herbal in Antiquity and Its Transmission to Later Ages,\" The Journal of Hellenic Studies 47, 1 (1927): 1-52. For a recent discussion of the various strands of the Pseudo Apuleius complex, see Myl\u00e8ne Paul Val\u00e9ry-Montpellier III, 2013. 116 substances as well as humans as patients, caregivers, and personified medicines.265 Harley 1585's version of the Complex includes over two hundred images of plant and animal remedies. While the materia medica illustrations in Harley are quite spectacular compared to earlier versions, the presence of the cycle itself is not unusual for the twelfth century. What most distinguishes Harley 1585 from other Pseudo-Apuleius Complex manuscripts are certain changes and additions placed before the materia medica section (see Table 4), which I call the \"preface.\" This part of the manuscript includes a prologue written by the compiler, a table of contents, and four libri (books) pseudonymously attributed to the ancient Greek medical writer Hippocrates. The preface also includes unusual visual features: varying column widths, richly painted illustrations juxtaposed with those that are unpainted, selective ornate initial letters and rubrics, and new illustrations\u2014including the earliest surviving depiction of what we today call surgery, or incision with a knife. While some of the preface texts appear in other Pseudo-Apuleius manuscripts, their arrangement, association with images, and mis-en-page are unprecedented.266 265 Most scholars assert that the associated illustrations are based on late antique models. Collins, Medieval Herbals, 167, argues that some of the images were created in the Middle Ages and did not have Late Antique antecedents. For a different view, see further Heidi Grape-Albers, Sp\u00e4tantike Bilder aus Verlag, 1977). 266 Some of the texts included in the preface of Harley are associated with the type \u00df version of the Pseudo-Apuleius Complex as defined by Howald and Sigerist, but the images and order as well as other modifications make Harley's composition unique, as will be discussed below. The typical \u00df-version includes: De liber vettonica, attributed to Antonius Musa (a treatise on the benefits of the herb betony); the larger Herbarius, attributed to Psuedo-Apuleius (a treatise on multiple herbs); De taxone, usually anonymus (a treatise on the uses of the badger); Liber medicinae ex animalibus attributed to Sextus in remedies); ex herbis femininis attributed to Dioscorides (another herbal); an Index for one or more of the various texts; and, finally, the \u00df-version also includes the Precationes (prayers to the earth and the herbs). See Henry Sigerist, \"Materia Medica in the Middle Ages,\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 7 (1939) 417-23; idem, \"The Medicinal Literature of the Early Middle Ages,\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 2 (1934): 117 Table 4: Contents of Harley 1585 The Preface Prologue Table of Contents for the materia medica section Four \"books\" attributed to Hippocrates De quatuor humores (On the four humours); includes a seated author illustration) Surgical Illustrations Epistula ad Maecenatem (Letter to Maecenus); attributed to Hippocrates in the text) Prayer to the earth and herbs; includes two illustrations materia medica Attributed to Plato of the city Apulia De herbis (On Diverse Herbs) Attributed animalibus et ex diversis avibus ([Medicines] diverse birds) Attributed to femininis podragrico (Apollo's letter on a plaster for gout) The style of the illustrations and the varying visual formats give the impression that the texts were taken from different late antique sources and added to the manuscript at different times. Codicological evidence, however, indicates that the manuscript was planned, ordered, and executed as one unit.267 Its small size (21.5 x 15.5cm, or 8.5 x 6 inches) suggests that it was made for a single reader and the script and features of some illustrations indicate that the manuscript likely derives from a monastery in the Meuse Valley. The expensive illustrations (some with gold flourishes) and fine/thin parchment suggest (1992), 432-442. The closest textual and organizational models to Harley include the ninth-century manuscripts Florence, Laurenziana, Plut. 73.41 (with Uniwersytecka, Codex III.F.19 (no Florence, Laurenziana, Plut. 73.16 and Vienna, \u00d6sterreichische Nationalbibliothek, Cod. 93 (no surgical images in either manuscript, S. Italy). 267 See Appendix C for codicological information on Harley. For the manuscript's relationship to Late Antique models see Grape-Albers, Sp\u00e4tantike Bilder, 118-120. 118 patron, possibly even Wibald, the of Stavelot, Malmedy, and briefly Monte Cassino (d. 1158), which has been recently suggested.268 This area, with Li\u00e8ge at its center, was a hub of intellectual activity, to which students came from all over to study theology, philosophy, mathematics, and medicine.269 268 This assessment is based on the most recent account of Harley 1585 by Minta Collins, Medieval Herbals, 207. She suggests Wibald of Stavelot as the patron based on the evidence that he was appointed abbot of Monte Cassino in 1136 and would have had access to the medical materials and new translations in its library. More research will be required to determine if her assessment is correct, but Wibald, who was an important figure in the twelfth century, is a likely candidate. Scholars have noted his many diplomatic roles and his wide patronage of expensive artworks. He was one of the leading political advisors for the German emperors, first serving Emperor Lothar II and, after his death in 1138, actively courting the favor of the new Emperor Conrad III of Staufen (ruled 1138-1155). He was largely successful at that endeavor, becoming a regular member of Conrad's court and acting as his representative on various diplomatic missions, including ones to the Byzantine court (he spoke Greek). Ellen Fenzel Arnold, \"Environment and the Shaping of Monastic Identity: Stavelot-Malmedy and the Medieval Ardennes,\" Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Minnesota, 2006, esp. 97-99, claims that Wibald studied medicine at Li\u00e8ge and notes that in his letters, he offers medical advice. Wibald thus had the interest and ability to get medical texts and the tastes and resources to pay for a personal luxury book like Harley. His relationship with Monte Cassino may explain the inclusion of the surgical procedures, many of which are the earliest extant. As a center of medical translation, Monte Cassino's library may have possessed late antique models from which images were chosen. Indeed, the earliest extant depictions of cautery, in Florence, Laurenziana, Plut. 73. 41, whose text is in a Beneventan script, were likely created at the monastery. For Wibald's edited letters, see Monumenta Germanie Buchhandlung, 2012). For more on Wibald, see Cynthia Hahn, Strange Beauty: Issues in the Making and Meaning of Reliquaries, 400-Circa 1204 (University Park, Pa.: Pennsylvania State University Wittekind, 1982); Tafeln (Berlin: 9.2 and Larry M.

Moreover, it was deemed important enough to become the model for at least two other lavish manuscripts: Oxford, Bodleian, MS. Ashmole 1975 (\"Sloane 1975\").270 While most scholars have been content to interpret Harley 1585 as a practical book of medicine, this chapter argues that it was more than that. The manuscript is also a source for ancient medical theory and at the same time constructs sophisticated Christological and cosmological arguments based on contemporary theological debates. It highlights the writings of the ancient medical author Hippocrates and simultaneously focuses on the patient, offering a broad excursus on the physical and moral sufferings of the human body The manuscript does this through its selection of texts, by the way it orders the preface, and, most important, by visual means. My examination of Harley 1585 will focus on the preface and proceed by assessing most texts and all the images in roughly in the same order as they appear in the manuscript. I begin with the prologue, for it succinctly sets up all the main issues of the manuscript. 2.2 The Harley 1585 Prologue and Table of Contents On its opening folio Harley 1585 announces itself as a medical manuscript that is concerned with more than just bodily cure. The compiler of the materials contained therein Nachwirken. 1200 Jahre Kultur Brepols, 1998), 43-90. 270 I refer to these two manuscripts throughout this chapter and note the changes made to the texts, images, and order. For a side-by-side comparison of the details of the three manuscripts, see Appendix D. 120 has composed a short prologue that not only describes its contents and how they are to be used but also sets them against the backdrop of a larger theoretical program: In hoc Hippocratic medicine; [2] Plato Apuleius of the city; [3] [Medicines] from Birds by Sextus Placitus Papiriensis; [4] [Medicines] from Feminine Herbs taken from the books of Dioscorides. Whoever wishes, if there is some cure he is looking for because of the infirmities of human beings that recur through the changes of the year, [that is] through the four quadrants of time, let him browse through the [table] with 209 chapters, so that as he looks through each individual herb for a cure, he might quickly find what he seeks by means of the numbers assigned to each book. Prologues were uncommon in earlier medieval medical manuscripts produced in northern Europe.271 Most simply begin with the rubrics for the first text,272 although a few 271 An exception is the Lorsch Leechbook, Lorscher Arztneibuch, Bamberg, Staatsbibliothek med. 1 (ca. 800). It contains a prologue that attempts to justify the study of medicine for a Christian public. Meg Leja \"The Sacred Art: 47, 2 (2016): 1-34. Late antique medical texts often began with letters addressed to a specific reader, but these letters are attached to individual medical texts and one manuscript could contain many of these prefatory letters. The Harley prologue introduces a manuscript compilation, rather than a single text. In the Middle Ages, some of the letters that contain medical content were often transmitted independently from the original text. Even within the Harley manuscript, the Epistula ad maecenatum includes a prologue-like epistle addressed to Mecenatus, possibly Maecenas, the advisor to Emperor Octavian. The modern edited work, Prefazioni prologhi, proemi di opera del \"Giornale Italiano di Filologia\" 7, 1992), contains essays that analyze the prologues found connected to many medical (and other types of) text written in Late Antiquity. 272 Paris, BnF, lat. 7028 (eleventh century) begins with rubrics attributing the discovery of medicine to Apollo and his son, Scolapius. For additional examples, see Augusto Beccaria, I Codici di Storia e letteratura, 1956). 121 open either with images of Greek medical gods273 or a textual reference to such gods,274 sometimes acknowledging the reader's Christian faith amid these pagan allusions.275 The Harley compiler's decision to start with a prologue was likely inspired by the medical materials originating from Monte Cassino and Salerno in southern Italy, the most important region for medicine in the early Middle Ages, and hubs for the translation and dissemination of Greek and Arabic medical works. Most of the translations produced in this region during the long twelfth century begin with prologues.276 These function as accessus ad auctores\u2014a late antique rhetorical formula that served as a method of approach to the assemblage of authorities and texts in a given manuscript and as a key to interpreting the 273 One example is the ninth-century herbal work, likely from the Loire Valley, which opens with an image of the god of medicine, Aesculapius (Greek, Asclepius), Kassel, Landesbibliothek, 2 MS phs. et The inscription reads \"Scolapius Medicus magister.\" Aesculapius was credited with the discovery of the herb betony, the subject of the first text in the manuscript, De herba vettonica. Another manuscript, London, BL, Cotton MS Vitellius C.III (eleventh century, with thirteenth-century materials added at the beginning), starts with a presentation scene (fol. 11v) and, after an index, an illustration of the transmission of medical/herbal knowledge from Aesculapius and the Centaur Chiron to \"Plato.\" 274 Wroclaw, Biblioteka Uniwersytecka, Codex III F 19 (ninth century, Metz?) begins with the following rubrics in a under a classical arch. 275 Laurenziana 73.41 opens with an image of a circular laurel Greco/Roman wreath along with a small cross. There are multiple inscriptions including one within the circle, however, only isolated terms can be read. The diagram on folio 1r is part of a quire created in the late ninth century and added to other texts before the twelfth century. Beccaria, I Codici, 281-284. This section likely constituted the first quire of quire begins with an index (fol. 9v) and then the Epistula ad Maecenatem. 276 Late Antique medical texts often included prologues or opening epistles and it is likely that these texts inspired Arab authors. For the prologues of Arabic medical texts see Danielle Jacquart, \"Le Introductifs en Arabe et en Latin,\" in Constantine the African and 'Al Ibn Al-'Abbs Al-Mags: The Pantegni and Related Texts, eds. and New York: French see Lucien I, Paris 1876, 383-8. 122 contents.277 These Italian works and translations were likely produced in the context of a schola medica and the accessus ad auctores were thus intended for students. For example, in his prologues, Constantine the African (d. ca. 1085-1098), based in Monte Cassino and the most famous late eleventh-century translator of Arabic medical works, frames his translations in such a way as to stress both the theoretical and practical aspects of studying medicine, while emphasizing the ancient medical authorities behind the texts (rather than the gods or Christian God as in earlier books of medicine).278 Most important for later scholastic medicine was his introduction of complex medical theory based on the Galenic notion of complexions. In his prologue to the Pantegni, a translation and adaptation of two tenth-century Arabic medical works associated with Haly Abbas, Constantine sets aside the Arabic 277 This was a trend in many forms of literature that appeared in the twelfth century. Alastair J. Minnis, Medieval Theory of Authorship, 2nd ed. (Philadelphia: Univeristy of Pennsylvania Press, 1988) and Edwin A.

Jordan, \"The Construction of a Philosophical Medicine: Exegesis and Argument in Salernitan Teaching 6 (1990): 42-61, and idem, \"Medicine as Early Commentaries on 'Johannitius,'\" Traditio 43 (1987): 121-45. For the classic study on the accessus ad auctores, see Richard Hunt, \"The Introductions to the Artes in contrast, his prologue to the much shorter Viaticum, based on the tenth-century Provisions for the Traveler and the Nourishment of the Settled by Ab Ga'far Ahmad ibn Ibrhm ibn Ab Khlid al-Gazzr, underscores that work's more practical bent. While the lengthy and more theoretical Pantegni, Constantine says, was for the more advanced student \"who pursues medicine for his own sake,\" the Viaticum was for one who practices it \"to seek a profit (ad proficuum questus).\" In addition to these pedagogical and economic concerns, in both prologues Constantine draws attention to the authority of the ancient Greek medical writers behind these texts rather than the divine authority stressed by the Arabic authors. For a succinct summary of Constantine's life and work, see Brian Long and Monica Green, \"Constantine the African,\" in Medieval Science, Technology and Medicine: An Encyclopedia, eds. Thomas F. Glick, Steven J. Livesey, and Faith Wallis (New York: Routledge, 2005), 145-47. For more on Constantine's translation practices with regard to the Pantegni, see Erik Kwakkel and Francis Newton, Medicine at Monte Cassino: Constantine the African and the Oldest Manuscript of his 'Pantegni' (Turnhout: Brepols, 2019); and Monica Green, \"The Re-creation of the Pantegni, Practica, book VIII,\" in Constantine the African and 'Al Ibn Al-'Abbs Al-Mags, 121-160. 123 author's humanistic emphasis on the value of medicine for the relief of suffering and instead focuses on the theoretical relationship between medicine and philosophy, placing the work within the traditional subdivisions of knowledge (physica, ethica, and logica). The prologues were thus fundamentally educational tools helping students approach, evaluate, and understand ancient, foreign works, whether Greek or Arabic, in a new theoretical context.279 The prologue to Harley 1585, while shorter in length, shares some of these characteristics. It does not directly base the authority of the medical knowledge contained in the manuscript on the divine but instead that of named ancient Greek medical experts: Hippocrates, Plato Apuleius, Sextus Placitus Papiriensis, and Dioscorides.280 Furthermore, the contents are framed for a precise use, the identification of cures for specific ailments. Unlike the prologues from southern Italy, however, that in Harley 1585 maintains the traditional concern with human suffering and does not mention an explicit educational or 279 There is also a less formal, but still pedagogical, prologue in the early eleventh-century work, the Passionarius of Gariopontus (d. 1050), which attempts to gather and organize the medical materials that had already been translated into Latin. It is considered the earliest known text associated with Salerno. According to the translation by Glaze, the prologue reads: \"If anyone desires to know intently the content of this whole book, let him first peruse quickly these preceding chapter headings, which he finds listed in brief citation at the head of this little book. Once he knows these, he will be able to know the contents of the whole book. This is the path that shows you the turnings and twistings of the following [text]: if you seek it carefully no error will lead you astray and prevent you from coming straight to the foot [sole/back cover] of the book's content. If you are able to remember this, fame will be yours and you will be able to be aware of each individual disease and its cure, and so in this manner you will find chapter headings briefly noted before each book.\" Florence Eliza Glaze, \"Speaking in Tongues: Medical Wisdom and Glossing Practices in and around Salerno, c. 1040-1200,\" in Herbs and Healers from the Ancient Mediterranean through the Medieval West: Essays in Honor of John M. Riddle, eds. Anne Van Arsdall and Timothy Graham (Farnham, Surrey, England and Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2012), 63-106, at 67-69. 280 Today, scholars recognize that these authorial attributions are false and that the names became attached to the texts for a variety of reasons. For example, Linda Voigts, \"The Significance of the Name 'Apuleius' to the Herbarium Apulei,\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 52, 2 (1978): 214-28, at 223, has given an explanation as to how the name \"Apuleius\" became associated with the Herbarius. She argues that the attribution likely became attached to the text because of the association of the name with the Greek god of medicine, thus insinuating the god as the ultimate source of the text. Sextus Placitius has not been identified. 124 economic function. Nonetheless, the Harley prologue does suggest that the manuscript was meant to serve a higher theoretical purpose. Through repeated allusions to the number four, the Harley compiler places the book's contents within a nexus of medical, metaphysical, cosmological, and theological theories based on Christian numerology and current Neoplatonic thought.281 In Christian numerology, the number four was associated both with the material world (four seasons, four major winds, four directions) and the idea of harmony (four evangelists/Gospels, four cardinal virtues).282 Similarly, twelfth-century Neoplatonic thought, largely based on Plato's Timaeus, offered a cosmological model of a harmonious and mathematically coherent universe (macrocosm) and human body (microcosm), each composed of four elements.283 The number four also related 281 Winthrop Wetherbee, \"Philosophy, and the Twelfth-Century Renaissance,\" in of Twelfth-Century Philosophy, ed. Peter Dronke (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988), 21-53. Byrhtferth's Enchiridion provides an example of an early medieval textual source interested in quaternities. In the fourth section of his treatise, the number four was deemed the most important number for the created cosmos. See Byrhtferth's Enchiridion, eds. Peter S. Baker and Michael Lapidge (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995). Manuscript examples, most of which contain illustrations, include Cambridge, Gonville & Caius College MS 428/428; London, BL, Digby and Oxford, Bodleian, MS. Bodl. 614. Some Neoplatonic thought was also incorporated into Christian doctrine by patristic authors, Augustine in particular. The Christianized view of the cosmic importance of the number four is also found in Isidore's De rerum natura as well as Macrobius, Commentarii in Somnium Scipionis. It is also incorporated into medieval Christian illustrations. For its application in Christian illustrations, see Anna Esmejier, Divina Quaternitas: A Preliminary Study in the Method and Application of Visual Exegesis (Assen: Gorcum, 1978). Esmejier's work focuses on the ability of images, particularly illustrations of four-related constituents of the world, to engage in exegesis-itself a four-part pedagogical strategy of early medieval Christian monks. 282 See, for example, Hugh of St. Victor, Didascalicon, Bk. II, Ch. 4 (\"Concerning the 4 of the Soul\") and Ch. 5 (\"Concerning the 4 of the Body\"), in The Didascalicon of Hugh of St. Victor: A Medieval Guide to the Arts, trans.

For the link to early medieval illustrations, see Esmeijer, Divina quaternitas and Bianca K\u00fchnel, The End of Time in the Order of Things (Regensburg: Schnell & Steiner, 2003). 283 This theory was in part a physica, or a natural philosophy focusing on what exists and principles of causation, and in part a story of creation, providing a philosophical understanding of the origination of the universe. Portions of the Timeaus were available to the Middle Ages, largely through the 125 to the four bodily humours that, when out of harmony, led to disease. Although it is not specifically named in the prologue, the pseudo-Hippocratic work De quatuor humores (On the Four Humours) is the first text in the manuscript. During the twelfth century, all of these ideas were discussed, debated and integrated into diverse, often conflicting, philosophical theories.284 In the prologue to Harley 1585, the compiler refers to the harmonious quaternities in several ways. Visually, the index across from the prologue is in four columns, a feature that is found in no extant manuscript containing the Pseudo-Apuleius Complex besides Harley and its copies (fig. 91).285 Textually, the first sentence of the manuscript names four writings of Late Antique Neoplatonists such as Boethius, Consolations; and Calcidius, who translated and commented upon a significant portion of the Timaeus. Wetherbee, \"Philosophy, Cosmology, and the Twelfth-Century Renaissance,\" 21-53; Irene Caiazzo, Four Elements in the of William of Conches,\" in Guillaume de Conches: Philosophie et science Caiazzo (Florence: Sismel, 2011), 3-66, at 31ff. For more information on medicine and Neoplatonic thought, see Richard McKeon, \"Medicine and Philosophy in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries: The Problem of the Elements,\" The Thomist 24 (1961): (Wiesbaden: F. Steiner, 1964). See also Jordan, \"The Construction of a Philosophical Medicine,\" particularly at 61 where he contrasts the more practical medicine in Salerno to the philosophical medicine of Paris, Chartres, Hereford, and Toledo. 284 Note that the original Timaeus also included a section on the human body and disease (69a-92a); however, it was not copied in either version of the work available to the Middle Ages. See Anna Somfai, \"The Eleventh-Century Shift in the Reception of Plato's 'Timaeus' and Calcidius's 'Commentary',\" Journal of the Warburg Institutes 65 (2002): 1-21; and Peter Lautner, \"Plato's Account of the Diseases of the Soul in Timaeus 86B1-87B9,\" Apeiron 44 (2011): 22-39. 285 The appearance of an index in Harley is related to three factors. First, indices categorically appear in type \u00df-version (but in no other version) of the Pseudo-Apuleius complex of which Harley is a member. Second, it relates to the increasing use in the twelfth century of indices and tables of contents linked to greater needs for reference reading. M.B. Parkes, \"The Influence of the Concepts of Ordinatio and Compilatio on the Development of the Book,\" in Scribes, Scripts and Readers: Studies in the Communication, Presentation and Dissemination of Medieval Texts, eds. Mary A. Rouse and Richard H. Rouse (London: The Hambledon Press, 1991), 35-70. Third, the four-part organization of the medical index is visually similar to biblical Canon Tables. These tables were mostly divided into four columns, one for each gospel. While they were essentially a tool for the exegetical study of the Bible, their visual depiction in four columns was meant to demonstrate the concordance and harmony 126 Hippocratic works included in the book as well as four authors in total.286 Note, however, that the sum of four authors is calculated in a peculiar way, for the preface combines two texts, both herbals, that are normally associated with two independent authors and assigns them to a single author.287 The De liber vettonica is usually attributed to Antonius Musa, and the Herbarius, to Apuleius; in Harley, they are combined as the De diversis herbis and attributed to the one author, platonis apoliensis urbis (Plato of the city of Apuleia).288 Notably, the third herbal in the manuscript, namely that of Dioscorides, is not added to this conglomeration. Dioscorides' herbal, Liber medicinae ex herbis femininis, maintains its usual attribution and is placed at the end of the manuscript after texts citing animal sources for medications.289 The number four appears two other times in the prologue. A few lines below the list of authors, the compiler inserted a repetitive and ambiguous clause to describe the changing seasons of a year or the stages in a human lifespan. The general sense is that the Harley of the four Gospels. Carl Nordenfalk, Die 36 (1982): 29-38, 29. 286 Scholars hold that all the texts are actually pseudonymous. See Kibre, Hippocrates latinus. 287 It is not, however, unprecedented to combine De liber vettonica and the Herbarius. (Breslau, Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek, Codex Wratislaviensis III F 19) also combines them in its index, however there are no rubrics indicating an attribution to a single author. A tenth-century manuscript, London, BL, Add. MS 8928, also combines the Herbarius and De liber vettonica in its index, however this link is based on the idea that both contain \"masculine\" herbs, while the separate Dioscorides text describes feminine ones. In Harley, the combination is not based on herbal gender but instead the desire to establish four authors in the prologue. 288 For other names attributed to the Herbarius see Voigts, \"The Significance of the Name 'Apuleius',\" 214-28. 289 Note that a later copy of Harley, Sloane 1975, maintains the four-author wording of the prologue and yet rearranges the herbal texts to place all of them consecutively. 127 manuscript should be consulted for the infirmities or weaknesses (imbecillitates) that affect humans during a period of time, which is styled as per quatuor quadrangula temporum, or through the \"four quadrants of time\" or the seasons.290 Hippocrates referred to the four stages of life but he did not use this terminology, and I have not been able to locate this phrase in any other medical text. It is, however, found in Christian exegesis. The ninth-century monk, Hrabanus Maurus, used the phrase, along with a commentary, in his work, De laudibus sanctae crucis, to describe the four quadrants that are formed in the negative space of the cross (fig. 92).291 In addition, Hugh of St. Victor based his vision of the composition of the ark on the materialization of four rectangles, each representing a stage in the progression towards unity with God.292 The discernment of these allusions was not taught by the type of 290 ut quis Louanges de la Sainte Croix, trans. and commentary Michel Perrin (Paris: Berg International, 1988). The associated text reads \"In 107, col Maurus's work contains a series of carmina figurata, or acrostic poems and explanations focusing on the nature of the Cross and Christ's Passion. Maurus's work was very popular in the Middle Ages and over fifty copies survive. In general, most of the chapters focus on Christ's victory through the Cross, however the chapter in which Maurus uses the phrase referring to four quadrangles is one in which he discusses God's creation of a coherent and harmonious cosmos (on which the celestial church is modeled); and it is the only acrostic that addresses salvation from the shedding of blood: martyrvm et ipse chorvs effvso ivre cruore (Even the choir of the martyrs rightly shed its blood). See also idem, L'Iconographie de la Gloire \u00e0 la sainte Maur (Turnhout: Figurata,\" in World Art: Themes of Unity in Diversity: Acts of the XXVIth International Congress of the History of Art, ed.

Beginning with the prologue, we find evidence, then, that Harley is not only a practical medical herbal useful for a doctor but also concerns the authority of ancient pagan medical authors, Christian numerology, theories on the nature and origination of the cosmos and the human body, and on the nature of human suffering and cure. It identifies itself as a book with over two-hundred medical remedies, but it is not a schoolbook nor is it meant to \"teach\" practical medicine. Rather it was intended to be both a resource for curing human suffering and an excursus on broader medical, theological, and philosophical ideas. These themes are qualified and expanded upon in the remainder of the preface, primarily through visual means: by mis-en-page, illustrations, and juxtapositions of text and image. 2.3 The Four \"Books\" of Hippocrates The prologue to Harley 1585 states that it contains four books authored by Hippocrates. Only one, a portion from the Epistle ad Maecenatum (Letter to Maecenas), contains a direct attribution.293 The other three can be conjectured by either their placement in the manuscript, illustrations that relate to Hippocrates, and evidence that other versions of the \"books\" name Hippocrates as their author. They include a text on the four humours with an author portrait, surgical illustrations and inscriptions, and a prayer to the earth and herbs with two associated images. On one level these texts and illustrations relate medical information, but they also offer reflections on contemporary Christian theology and ethics. 293 The incipit to the text on folio 10r names Hippocrates as the writer, Ypochrates mecennati suo salute. 129 Even more, the images suggest that Hippocrates's works anticipate Christian ideas on human suffering. 2.3a Book 1: \"De quatuor humores\" The first Hippocratic text concerns the four humours. While there is no direct attribution to Hippocrates, the text appears in a few other earlier medical miscellanies with an incipit naming him as its author.294 In the corpus of extant medical manuscripts, this is the first time that the four humours text appears with a Pseudo-Apuleius Complex and juxtaposed with surgical procedures.295 In Harley 1585 the text is placed first, immediately after the index, and opens with a large, ornate initial letter\u2014the only one in the manuscript 294 See Kibre, Hippocrates latinus, 145. Kibre links the four humours text in Harley 1585 to a much longer letter called the Epistula ad Antiochum regum, often associated with Hippocrates in medieval texts but likely from a much later date. Other examples of the text are found in, for example, London, BL, nigrum\" (lacks one leaf) (this text has many similarities to Harley but is shorter). Another manuscript with the same text but a different incipit is London, BL, Harley MS 912, fols. least twelve recensions exist of the longer letter and all are based on physiology; however, this is the only one that focuses exclusively on the humours. Each recension includes at least one (but often more) of the following segments from the original letter: the four parts of the body, the dietary calendar, phlebotomy, and the four humours. See 295 Before Harley, De quattuor humoribus was usually one of many medical abstracts in encyclopedic miscellanies. Similar four humours texts with the same (or similar) incipit exist from the ninth and eleventh centuries and are listed by Kibre, Hippocrates latinus, and Beccaria, I codici di medicina, along with descriptions of other works in each manuscript. No other extant example of this text is found with the Pseudo-Apuleius Complex and it appears in only one other surviving manuscript that contains cautery illustrations (with the exception of the copies of Harley 1585). 130 (fig. 93).296 This text is thus indicated as special. It not only corresponds with the compiler's interest in quaternities, but it is also a theoretical medical text--one of the few available in the early Middle Ages.297 The treatise describes each bodily humour noting their Aristotelian-based characteristics (hot, cold, dry, wet); their relationships to the four elements and the four seasons; and discusses the temperaments (mores) produced by a dominance of one humour. More important, it describes the role of each humour in causing sickness (imbalance) and methods to bring the body back into harmony. Another remarkable feature, appearing in no other earlier De quattuor humores text, is the illustration found on the last page of the text (fig. 94). Unframed and unpainted, the ink drawing depicts a bearded man seated on a jeweled architectural plinth, holding an empty scroll. The Phrygian hat he wears denotes his antiquity as does the scroll form of the book he holds, rather than a more contemporary codex. The fact that the author holds the scroll with a covered hand, a visual feature often used for religious works, indicates its special nature as 296 and ornate \"Q\" decorated with a vine and leaf motif. 297 Most scholars argue that there was very little extant medical theory before the works of Constantine, however this text as well as a few others can be found in early medieval manuscripts. Kibre, Hippocrates Latinus, 172. See for the Harley text is not of the same complexity as presented in Constantine's Pantegni, also based on the four humours, it provides a simple form of medical theory that was already available in Latin. The full Galenic theory of pharmaceutical medicine was expounded in Constantine's Pantegni. This theory divides substances, all of which are composed of the four elements, by four qualities (hot, cold, wet, dry), each of which can be measured on a scale of four degrees. According to Galen, the doctor must also understand the dominant qualities of the patient's body and the sickness (both also four) in order to cure the patient with a remedy with a contrary quality. Wallis, \"The Ghost in the Articella,\" 112-113. This complex assessment process did not catch on immediately. The schools in Paris, Chartres, Hereford, Toledo, and other major scholastic centers, were more interested in placing medicine within a cosmological scheme--not unlike Harley. Jordan, \"The Construction of a Philosophical Medicine,\" 61. 131 one that should not be touched by human hands.298 He gestures to his left (our right), towards a young apprentice who cautiously looks at the enthroned figure while presumably preparing ingredients for a medication. While the identities of the individuals are not specified by any caption, the seated figure very likely depicts Hippocrates. The image is found at the end of the four humours text associated with him and it is placed within the four books of Hippocrates segment of the manuscript.299 The placement of the image at the end of a text rather than at the beginning where authorial portraits are usually found is unusual but has at least two possible functions. First, the position of the image and the gesture of the author may indicate that Hippocrates is \"author\" of the surgical images that follow, thereby providing the illustrations with the status of one of the \"books\" named in the preface.300 There is, indeed, a contemporary set of cautery illustrations that contain a similar enthroned figure at the beginning of the images who is identified as Hippocrates.301 The opening folio in a twelfth-century medical 298 For more examples, see Victor M. Schmidt, \"Some Notes on Scrolls in the Middle Ages,\" Quaerendo 41 (2011): 373-383. 299 While the idea of four humours predates Hippocrates, he or his school adopted the concept and brought it into medical theory. By Late Antiquity, the link between humoral doctrine and Hippocratic corpus was sealed by the commentaries of Galen, who attributes the doctrine to him. David C. Lindberg, The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, Prehistory to A.D. 1450, 2nd ed. (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2007), 124-126. 300 The cautery illustrations in London, BL, Sloane MS 2839, fols. 1v-3r, are accorded the status of a \"book.\" The incipit placed above the of Cautery Surgery of Appollonius and Galen, on the Art of Medicine). 301 Three of the nine illustrated cautery manuscripts from the twelfth-century or earlier name Hippocrates as their author. In addition to the example in Ambrosianus D 2 that follows, the cautery text in Paris, BnF, lat. 7028, names Hippocrates as its author. Hippocrates is also directly associated with a specific cautery procedure in the twelfth-century Pr\u00fcfening manuscript that will be discussed in chapter 3. 132 manuscript (Milan, Ambrosiana, Codex Ambrosianus D 2 inf., \"Ambrosianus D 2\") shows a seated man with a Phrygian hat, here labeled \"ypocras,\" and a standing student (discipulus); and the image has been placed at the beginning of a series of cautery illustrations (fig. 95).302 The comparison also suggests a second potential functions for the illustration in Harley 1585. As in Harley, the Ambrosianus D 2 author holds his text with a cloth-covered hand, but here he points to a modern codex. The eyes of the discipulus follow Hippocrates's hand directly to the open book. The meaning seems to be that the student uses the knowledge found in the codex, from either a text or more likely an illustration, to perform the cautery procedure. Thus, the focus of the illustration is the transmission of practical, \"how-to\" knowledge to a student. At the same time, the reader of Ambrosianus D 2 would have been reminded that he too held a codex in his hand, one that contained surgical illustrations and medical texts. This suggests that the reader is to use this manuscript in a way similar to the discipulus in the image, that is, as a reference guide for practical medicine. Thus, the pointed finger of the author in Ambrosianus D 2 acts as a cognitive, indexical tool for both the discipulus depicted on the page and the reader of the book. The Harley image, however, is different. The author's pointed finger does not direct the student (or the reader) to the text itself, which, because it is represented as an ancient scroll rather than a modern codex, undermines a sense of its practical usability. In addition, the student prepares a medication rather than perform surgery. Its indexical function, instead, may be twofold. First, the fact that Hippocrates points to his left instead of to the scroll may 302 While scholars believe that the inscription was made by a later hand, they affirm that it was added in the twelfth century. Luigi Bellone, \"An Illustrated Treatise on Cauterization in a Codex of the 'Passionarius Garioponti,'\" Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences 7.4 (1952): 362-368, at 366. 133 suggest that the full meaning of his writings can be found on the opposite folio--that is, in the illustration. The reader or viewer is thus advised to look there. The second possibility involves a larger organizational and interpretive construct within the manuscript and will be discussed at the end of this section. 2.3b Book 2: Surgical Procedures Immediately following the author portrait on folio 7v are a series of painted images depicting surgical procedures. The medieval term chirurgie included not only cutting into the body but also indeed primarily, wound treatment, treatment of ulcers, reduction of fractures and dislocations, bloodletting, orthopedics, and cautery. Harley 1585 contains fourteen illustrations of surgery: nine that depict solely cautery procedures, or burning (incenditur) with a hot iron rod; three that show various types of incisions (inciditur); and one that includes both burning and incision. While examples of the burning can be found as early as in the ninth century, the surgical cutting illustrations are the earliest surviving of their kind.303 Specific features of the illustrations themselves will be discussed below, but it is important to mention here one general observation of the images as a group: some are painted with rich colours (fols. 8r-9r) and others are line drawings (fol. 9v). The painted 303 It is possible that images of cutting were not (re)produced until this time, for the twelfth century coincides with the resurgence of interest in surgery based on the influx of Arabic medical texts, including Constantine the African's Pantegni, Practica, which included a surgical section. At least the first part of the surgical section (Book IX) survives in three mid-twelfth century manuscripts: Durham, Dean and Chapter Library, London, BL, Add. MS 22719. Monica Green, \"Crafting a (Written) Science of Surgery: The di Storia della Medicina dell'Universit\u00e0 di Roma, 1960). 134 illustrations include all the images of cautery procedures as well as two depictions where the term for cutting (inciditur) is used (for podagra and hemorrhoids). Within the painted section, there are only two images of doctors, no medical helpers, and no visual or textual evidence of the various ointments used for aftercare or of the different tools used in the procedures. By contrast, the unpainted surgical images both depict doctors, varying tools, and ointments for post-surgical treatment. One might say that the painted illustrations in Harley 1585 show less interest than the unpainted ones in the actual medical procedures themselves. Indeed, as will be demonstrated below, the painted images are filled with associations that link them to contemporary theological issues and natural philosophy. I have organized the discussion of the individual surgical illustrations that follows based on their order in the manuscript, with the painted images of cautery and cutting appearing first followed by the unpainted illustrations of cutting. 2.3b.1: Folio 8r: For headaches, stomachaches, and discharge of the gums Harley's cautery images begin with a full-page painted illustration of one doctor and two patients (fig. 97). An inscription is written above the head of each patient explaining the ailment for which they are being treated: the first patient for pain of the head and \"choking\" of the stomach (ad dolorem capitis et prefocationem stomachi); the second for discharge of the gums (ad reuma gingiuarum). Each patient's body displays burn marks from a cautery iron, but the doctor is seen performing a cautery procedure on only the first patient. The depiction in this image of one patient witnessing another's surgical procedure is not found in any other manuscript apart from the copies of Harley 1585. 135 Despite the appearance of the doctor, the illustration does not focus on his status or prowess, or even his medical art.304 Only a single tool of his trade, a cautery iron, is shown. There are no braziers with a fire and additional tools, nor are there any beds or medical helpers. Both the doctor and the patients are standing; they are relatively the same height and the doctor is less distinguished than the larger, enthroned medical author (Hippocrates) on the opposite folio. Instead of focusing on the auctoritas, professionalism, or the \"divine\" work of the doctor, the illustration in Harley 1585 is centered on the middle patient, who is depicted as a Christ-like figure.305 The illustration makes the connection between the patient and Christ by exploiting the visual vocabulary of the Passion\u2014the narrative accounts of Jesus's arrest, torture, and death on the Cross. The gospel accounts of Jesus's arrest begin after the Last Supper and his agony in Gethsemane. One of the apostles, Judas, returns with a group of armed men and identifies Christ with a kiss. At that point, the men physically lay hold of Jesus and bring him to trial before the Sanhedrin. In Matthew's Gospel, the arrest is described as follows: \"[t]hen they came up, and laid hands on Jesus and held him.\" Mark's Gospel uses similar words, while in Luke, Jesus is \"apprehended\" and in John, he is \"bound.\"306 Medieval depictions of the scene often show Christ held by the wrist. His facial expressions and gestures, however, show no fear or anger but instead depict an acceptance of his confinement with a calm humility (figs. 304 Earlier medical books, such as the Lorscher Arztneibuch, likened the doctor to Christus medicus. 305 In the later Middle Ages, the iconography will often connect both the doctor and the patient to Christ. Karl Whittington, \"Picturing Christ as Surgeon and Patient in British Library, Sloane 22: 47-54 (Christ is \"apprehended\"); John 18: 12-13 (here, Christ is \"bound\"). 136 98-99).307 In Harley, the doctor restrains the middle patient by holding on to his wrist--an unusual location to hold a patient, although not unprecedented in medieval cautery illustrations. In general, if a doctor touches a patient, he places his hand at the shoulder or elbow. In addition, like Christ, the patient's facial expression, rounded eyes, and gentle extension of one arm reveal a sympathetic humanity, as if he has fully accepted his form of suffering, both the disease and the medical treatment itself. In this way, the artist communicates a sense of the patient's quiet submission to the cautery iron, a submission that is like Christ's humble acceptance of his Passion. The Harley composition also includes visual elements from the Crucifixion. One of the typical depictions of the Crucifixion shows Jesus in the middle of two figures who both gesture towards him (figs. 100-101).308 In general, this type of crucifixion scene includes Mary on the left (to the right of Christ) and John the beloved disciple on the right (to the left of Christ). Both gesture towards Jesus, making him the focal point of the image. In the twelfth century, Christ is usually depicted bare-chested and wearing only a short loincloth at the waist. Like the crucifixion scenes, the focus of Harley's illustration is on the center patient towards whom the doctor turns and the second patient gestures. Also like Christ, the middle patient in Harley is bare-chested and wears a short loincloth around the waist.

For a discussion of the typical three-person crucifixion scene, see Schiller, 88-117. For a biblical reference to this scene, see John 19:26-27. 137 missing arm of the second patient on the right, while possibly a mistake, may also mimic that of the disciple John, whose left arm is often shown covered. The suffering of the disease and treatment is brought to the fore with a further link between the image and a later event in Christ's Passion: his torture on the Cross. The gospel accounts vary in their details, but, in general, Jesus is offered vinegar (Mark 15:36; Matthew 27:48, Luke 23:36) or vinegar and hyssop (John 19:29) for his thirst by an unnamed bystander.309 In the Gospel of John, a soldier also pierces (perforavit) Jesus's side with a spear.310 In later apocryphal accounts, the two torturers were given names, Stephaton and Longinus. Illustrations depicting this scene usually show the moment when Longinus, standing on the left side of the folio, places his lance on the right side of Christ's chest. Stephaton, on the right, often holds a pail in his left hand and a reed with a sponge in his right (figs. 102-103).311 In Harley, the doctor could be compared to Longinus, for he also holds a tool that produces pain and its tip is located in the same place as where Christ is pierced. Yet, it is not just visual evidence that supports this allusion, for the connection is also created by the choice of procedures for the page.312 Second, this specific ailment of \"choking\" of the 309 Christ is twice offered a drink, the first drink is often described as wine with myrrh (Mark) or sour wine (Matthew). For the entire torture narrative, see Mark 15:24-37; Matthew 27:34-50; example, the Stammheim Missal, Los Angeles, J. Paul Getty Museum, MS 64, fol. 86r (twelfth century, Hildesheim); and Munich, BSB, Clm 14159, fol. 5r (twelfth century, Regensburg/Pr\u00fcfening). 312 There are many other illustrations of head ailments from which to choose. Laurenziana 73.41 alone depicts five examples of sickness that occurs in or on the head and Paris, BnF, lat. 7028, with cautery texts, lists five others. 138 stomach, whose meaning is not precisely clear, is not described or depicted in any earlier manuscript. Only two other manuscripts, Florence, Laurenziana, MS Plut. 73.41 (\"Laurenziana 73.41\") (fig. 104) and Ambrosianus D 2 (fig. 105), combine the ailment of an aching head and the problem of prefocationem (choking); however in these manuscripts, the cautery marks are placed on the throat--a more obvious place for \"choking.\"313 Indeed, in no other cautery text or later manuscript, with the exception of the copies of Harley 1585, do we find the ailment of a choking stomach. In fact, it is possible that this ailment was invented by the compiler in order to show the doctor placing a cautery iron on the patient's torso. In terms of the second procedure on the page, \"for discharge of the gums\" (ad reuma gingiuarum), there are no disparities in cautery marks between the Harley image and the many other manuscripts that refer to this ailment.314 The differences occur in the depiction of the patient and the choice of this specific procedure for the page. There are many procedures for the head region which could have been chosen, but the compiler/artist employed one for the mouth and positioned the patient on the right-side of a three-part composition. The ailment itself is important, for the reference to painful gums may allude to another scene of the Passion of Christ, when Stephaton, who is usually shown to the right of Christ, places the sponge of sour wine in Jesus's mouth.315 313 See Laurenziana 73.41 image only shows three burn marks on the patient's forehead, while the Ambrosianus D 2 illustration also includes marks on the patient's neck-ostensibly for symptoms of (throat-based) choking. 314 A cautery cure for the discharge of the gums is also found in Laurenziana 73.41; Ambrosianus D 2; Pr\u00fcfening, and one of the copies of Harley 1585, Sloane 1975. It is likely that it appeared in another copy of Harley 1585, Ashmole 1462, but that folio does not survive. 315 It is also possible that the choice of a mouth disease relates to the verse from Psalms 106:42: \"the upright see it and are glad; and all wickedness stops its mouth.\" 139 There are other visual ways that the second patient can be linked to Stephaton. Unlike Longinus, who was ultimately redeemed, Stephaton did not repent of his deed and remained universally reviled.316 As such, images of Stephaton usually show him either with a physical deformity or in some depraved manner.317 In the Harley illustration, the second patient is missing the lower region of his arm. Although this might be read as a variation on the figure of John, as discussed above, it may also be considered a deformity, for this is the arm of Stephaton that would normally hold the pail of sour wine. While it is possible, of course, that the artist was copying a lost ancient model and ran out of space or made a mistake, there is no other \"mistake\" like this in the rest of the manuscript. Another possible link to Stephaton is that the patient is unnecessarily depicted as only partially clothed. A typical way to distinguish Stephaton and his depravity was to show him in revealing clothes and often with bared legs. 318 An example of this depiction can be seen in the eleventh-century Pericopes of Henry II where, in contrast to Longinus, no hose appears on Stephaton's legs and his feet are bare (fig. 106).319 In Harley, the second patient's chest and legs are uncovered even though cautery marks appear only on his forehead and chin. In subsequent illustrations in Harley, patients are shown fully clothed for procedures that do not 316 For primary source examples of this distinction, see the Acts of Pilate (fifth century) and the Martyrology of St. Jerome (fourth or fifth century). See also Rose J. Peebles, The Legend of Longinus in Ecclesiastical Tradition and in English Literature, and its Connection with the Grail (Baltimore: J.H. Furst, 1911). 317 In the twelfth century, Stephaton is also often depicted as Jew, which relates to the increasing anti-Semitism of this period. See William Chester Jordan, \"The Last Tormentor of Christ: An Image of the Jew in Ancient and Medieval Exegesis, Art and Drama,\" The Jewish Quarterly Review 78, 1-1 (1987): 21-47; and idem, \"The Erosion of the Stereotype of the Last Tormentor of Christ,\" The Jewish Quarterly Review 81, 1-2 (1990): 13-44. 318 Jordan, \"The Last Tormentor of Christ,\" 38. 319 Pericope Book of Henry II, Munich, BSB, Clm 4452 (eleventh century, Reichenau). Jordan, 38. 140 include cautery points on the torso. In addition, all other depictions of this cautery procedure, excepting the copies of Harley 1585, show the patient as fully clothed (figs. 107-108).320 These visual references to nefarious enemies of Christ were not intended as a moral judgment on the doctor or the second patient. Rather, they serve to inform the meaning of the middle patient who represents a Christ-like figure. There are two levels to this interpretation, one physical the other spiritual. First, the cautery procedure itself is seen as salvific. Just as Christ endured the torture of the Cross in order to overcome the disease of sin, so too can the patient's endurance of cautery applications overcome an illness of the body. Second, through the suffering of disease and a painful medical procedure, the patient participates in the suffering and pain of Christ's Passion. In this sense, sickness and its prescribed cures are understood to be redemptive. The association between Christ and a suffering patient recurs on the final page of the painted surgical images. It will be discussed below. These two levels of interpretation are grounded in an understanding of the nature of Christ and the meaning of his Passion and Resurrection for humankind. They also reflect a profound shift in this understanding that was taking place in the twelfth century. An older view, that of Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages, understood salvation as fundamentally something Christ did for humanity, defeating sin through his Cross in order that people might participate in the divine life of God.321 By the twelfth century, however, the emphasis was shifting towards a focus on Christ's humanity, something that individuals 320 Laurenziana 73.41, fol. 125r and Ambrosianus D 2, fol. 2v. 321 Major voices in early Christianity, such as Hilary of Poitiers (ca. 315-367), asserted that Christ felt no physical pain during His Passion, likely to counter the Arian position that the incarnated Christ was essentially inferior to God the Father. According to Hilary, a Christ that was equal in divinity to the Father would not feel pain. Kevin Madigan, The Passions of Christ in High-Medieval Thought: An Essay on Christological Development (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), 51-62. 141 could participate in through imitation of his earthly life, including imitation of his suffering, which itself assumed a redemptive function.322 The Harley manuscript holds both Christological outlooks in tension with one another. The patient at the center of fol. 8r, depicted with forms that allude to Christ's Passion, is both a recipient of and a participant in his cure. Rather than solely depicting the practicalities of performing a cautery procedure, this image is laden with profound theological insight. 2.3b.2 Folio 8v: For ailments of the lungs, liver, spleen, stomach, and kidneys The following page contains images of treatments for illnesses of the body's upper and lower torso regions (fig. 109). The page itself is divided into two parts, with ailments of the upper torso at the top in a rectangular-shaped quadrant and those of the lower torso below in a bordered square. The bodies in the lower section display the cautery points for four different procedures involving illnesses of the liver (epar), spleen (splen), stomach 322 Peter Lombard (1096-1160) specifically reinterpreted Hilary of Poitiers' position to allow for the acceptance of the suffering felt by Christ. The Sentences, 3.14.3, 2:100-111, trans. Guilio Silano (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 2007-2010). Peter was not alone in this new position. See also the works of Saint Anselm; Bernard of Clairvaux, Peter Abelard, and Thomas Aquinas as discussed in Madigan, The Passions of Christ, 56-58 and idem, \"On the High-Medieval Reception of Hilary of Poitiers's anti-'Arian' Opinion: A Case Study of Discontinuity in Christian Thought,\" The Journal of Religion 78, 2 (1998): 213-229. For the changing ideas of suffering and imitatio Christi see Giles Constable, Three Studies in Medieval Religious and Social Thought: The Interpretation of Mary and Martha, the Ideal of the Imitation of Christ, the Orders of Society (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press); Caroline Walker Bynam, Jesus as Mother: Studies in the Spirituality of the High Middle Ages, Publications of the Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, UCLA, 16 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1982); and eadem, \"Women Mystics and Eucharistic Devotion in Interdisciplinary Journal 11, 1-2 (1984): 179-214, esp. 201-2. For changes in the iconography of Christ on the Cross, see Celia Chazelle, The Crucified God in the Carolingian Era: Theology and Art of Christ's Passion (Cambridge & New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001). 142 (stomaticus), and kidneys (renes) and they are lined up in a schematic fashion, each depicted with a different expressive posture. The top section, concerning the upper torso, focuses on lung diseases and depicts the cautery points for two procedures: one for gasping and emphysema (ad anhelitum & disinam) and the second for epticus (likely, , a type of emphysema or pneumonia).323 Both of these treatments require cautery burns on the front and the back of the body, and so the two patients who are the recipients of each are portrayed twice, facing up and facing down. Confusion arises, however, because the two bodies meant to represent the same person do not look alike. In each case only one of the body doubles wears a sheath around the waist and their hairstyles vary from front and back views. There is one precedent for using a body double to portray the same patient in depictions of cautery treatments. One ninth-century cautery illustration that treats consumption (ptisicos) found in Laurenziana 73.41 shows two bodies that are similarly dressed, their hand positions match, and they calmly lie side-by-side on beds in a clinical setting rather than head-to-head along an artistic border (fig. 110).324 With the exception of the copies of Harley 1585\u2014and even in these the green bands devolve into beds\u2014this kind of dual-body representation is not found in any other manuscript from the twelfth century or before.325 323 Brian Long, \"Body and Soul,\" 202, claims that the term \"anhelitus,\" was first used by Constantine in the Viaticum and is a transliteration of an Arabic word into Latin. In the early eleventh century, Gariopontus standardized the Greco-Latin medical terminology; however, he does not use the term \"anhelitus.\" Instead, he uses the Greco-Latin words \"dyspnea\" or \"orthomia.\" Harley uses a variant of \"dyspnea\" and the term anhelitus. Anhelitus is also used in the early cautery manuscripts such as Laurenziana 73.41 and Paris, BnF, lat. 7028. 324 The body double occurs on folio 123v. It appears that the patient facing backwards may have a different style of hair, but the image looks like it has been altered and partially erased. 325 See Sloane 1975, fol. 92r and Ashmole 1462 fol. 9r & 9v. 143 Besides the schematic arrangement and ambiguous body doubles, the Harley folio is also distinguished by its lack of any evidence of a clinical setting. No doctors, cautery tools, or medical ointments appear, only partially dressed and naked bodies in quite expressive poses. The peculiar arrangement and illustration of these patients suggests they were intended to refer to more than just matters of practical medicine. In the first place, some of the diseased patients are shown in a manner that implies their base nature and immoral character. Second, the symmetrical arrangement of the bodies on the page and in units of four indicates that the illustrations are informed by an underlying theory of unity and harmony. The belief that the appearance of the external body somehow reflects the character of a person's internal soul was prevalent in medieval thought and commonly expressed in artistic depictions. For example, we find personifications of the vices as disheveled and violent in manuscript copies of Prudentius's Psychomachia (fig. 111)326 and as tormented and disfigured bodies in sculptural features on Romanesque churches (fig. 112).327 Images of the Day of Judgement often contrasted those condemned to hell with those rising to heaven by their bodily depictions.328 The central tympanum of the Romanesque church at Conques 326 Lyon, Biblioth\u00e8que du Palais des Arts, Ms. 22, fol. 7r (1075-1099, France). The Psychomachia, or Battle for Man's Soul, is an allegorical poem that portrays seven violent confrontations between the virtues and the vices. For more on the Psychomachia, see Joanne S. Norman, Metamorphoses of an Allegory: The Iconography of the Psychomachia in Medieval Art (New York: Peter Lang, 1988). Other texts on the vices are found, for example, in Paris, BnF, lat. 2077, which was compiled from two Carolingian authors, Halitgar and Ambrosius Autpertus. Jill Bradley, 'You Shall Surely Not Die': The Concepts of Sin and Death as Expressed in the Manuscript Art of Northwestern Europe, c. 800-1200, vol. 1 (Leiden: Brill, 2008), 233. 327 See Moissac, Church of St. Peter, Detail of West Wall of Porch, The Punishment of Avarice (left) and Unchastity (right) \"The Romanesque Sculpture of Moissac, Part I (2),\" The Art Bulletin 13, 4 (1931): 464-531, at 508ff, esp. 520. 328 Images of the (invisible) soul were regularly depicted as a miniature human body, with some variations. The (soul) body could also have wings, such as found in the mosaic of the Creation of Adam at San Marco in Venice, or also be represented as a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes as seen 144 displays sinful bodies as partially dressed or fully naked, and bent, twisted, and curled into irregular and contorted shapes (right, fig. 113). Hell itself appears as a space of chaos, agony, and turbulence with bodies placed haphazardly and unsystematically (fig. 114). Conversely, Heaven looks neat and orderly with the bodies of the saved remaining upright, fully dressed, and dignified.329 More specifically for a monastic audience, carved capitals in twelfth-century cloisters show a m\u00e9lange of animals, hybrids, and distorted bodies thought to represent the anguish of monastic discipline. The images not only represented humankind's base and irrational nature, but they also served to \"externalize\" the internal strife endured by the monks in their quest to achieve moral perfection.330 The same iconological trope is employed in Harley 1585 but in this case in the depiction of \"patients.\" On folio 8v, figures with similarly twisted, distorted, naked, and beast-like bodies appear. This is most apparent in the patients who face backward.331 In the in an illumination of the Death of Mary (Pericope Moshe Barasch, Soul. The Long Life of a Medieval Creation,\" Artibus et Historiae 26, 52 (2005): 13-28. 329 Madeline Caviness, \"Images of Divine Order Third Mode of Seeing,\" Gesta 22 (1983): 99-120, figure 3. 330 Thomas Dale, Corporeal Deformities, and Phantasms in the Cloister of St-Michel-de-Cuxa,\" The Art Bulletin 83, 3 (2001): 402-436, 407ff. Thomas Dale described sculpted images of animals, hybrids, and distorted bodies on twelfth-century monastic cloister capitals of St-Michel-de-Cuxa as visible presentations of a human soul besieged by desires. For Dale, the sculpted images at effectively \"externalized\" the internal strife endured by the monks in their conquest for moral perfection. See in particular, the example of a fully human, but naked, distorted and gesticulating entertainer. The dancer is depicted in an odd position, with his body facing to the side, while his head twists forward in a perpendicular direction. In addition, his legs bend into an unusual shape, almost as if he sits in mid-air. Dale describes this figure as relating to prostitution and thus, a soul struggling against the desires of the flesh. Dale, 410-414. 331 The top section also involves diseases of the lungs, the result of which is to obstruct the breath (pneuma). In medieval thought, the breath is often related to the soul. G\u00e9rard Verbeke and Leonardo Tar\u00e1n, L'\u00c9volution de la (Paris, Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer, 1945). 145 top register, while both \"front\" and \"back\" patients bend their bodies to fit into the tightly defined space imposed by the bands and the border, the naked bodies seen from the back are even more twisted into unnatural shapes. The head of the top patient awkwardly extends upward atop hunched shoulders\u2014evoking the image of a braying donkey\u2014and grabs the head of his body double. The patient below, as if an owl, twists his head directly up to look at the man horizontally positioned above him. Both exemplify the lower, bestial nature of the body that needs to be rationally controlled; they are also comparable to illustrations of the vices found in roughly contemporary manuscripts (figs. 115-116).332 In the lower register, the fourth figure who is shown from behind is also naked and his genitals are unnecessarily in view. While nude bodies were part of the normal visual vocabulary of ancient medicine, this was not the case in the medieval Christian West.333 In general, nude bodies were a symbol for sin, especially those depicted with genitals prominently displayed.334 The figures with more controlled and orderly bodies face forward and can be interpreted as possessing (more) morally upright souls.335 In the top register, the forward- 332 See Paris, BnF, lat. 2077, fol. 163r in Metamorphoses of BnF, lat. 11629, fol. 3r, in Adolph Allegories of the Virtues and Vices in Mediaeval Art: from Early Christian Times to the Thirteenth Century (London: The Warburg Institute, 1939), figure 22. 333 Examples are found in tenth-century Greek medical books thought to have been modeled on ancient works. Sudhoff, Ein Beitr\u00e4ge Barth, 1914), I, 4-7. 334 See, for example, the female personification of Avarice on the South Portal of the church of St. Pierre in Moissac, France in fig. 130 herein or the jonguleurs on the cloister capitals of St-Michel-de-Cuxa. Dale, \"Monsters, Corporeal Deformities, and Phantasms,\" figures 5-7. While there may be circumstances in which nudity, especially male nude bodies, can signify embodied faith and piety, this attribution generally applies only if the nude male body is depicted in a heroic context, which is not the case here. Kirk Ambrose, The Marvellous and the Monstrous in the Sculpture of Twelfth-Century Europe (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2013), 40-63. 335 Hugh of St. Victor (1096-1141) authored a work for novice monks in which he aimed to discipline their external gestures in order to help build their internal morality. He provides examples of 146 facing person in each body-double is at least partially clothed and calmly lying supine with his hands placed compliantly behind his back. While this posture may prevent a patient from obstructing the burning cautery rod, it also suggests a peaceful acceptance of the pain of the procedure. On the bottom register, the three standing and forward-facing patients are also partially clothed and their bodies are more controlled. The first from the left looks upward; the second lowers his head in humility and raises his right hand in greeting; and the third nobly turns his head in profile, a stance similar to depictions of the emperor on ancient Roman coins. These patients, partially nude with composed dispositions, also bear certain similarities to images of the martyrs, whose bodies are marked by blows from weapons and yet they are depicted calmly bearing their torture. 336 By depicting physically diseased patients with various internal moral states, the illustrations on folio 8v conflate the notions of sickness and sin. This association between the physical and the moral is not new. From the earliest Christian times the pain of illness was linked with the Fall of Adam and Eve and regarded as the price paid by humanity for original sin. At the same time, suffering and sickness was often described, most notably by St. undisciplined gestures that describe at least of the standing patients: \"[s]ome men are incapable of listening without jaws agape, and as if meaning entered the mind via the mouth, they open it wide to take in the words of the speaker. And others (far worse!), when they do something or listen to someone, stick out their tongue like a thirsty dog...Others stick out their finger while speaking...or they stand rooted to the spot in profound meditation and an outward pretense of some inner magnificence.\" De institutione novitiorum, 941C-D, trans. Jaeger, The Envy of Angels, 255. 336 Cynthia Hahn, Portrayed on the Heart: Narrative Effect in Pictorial Lives of Saints from the Tenth through the Thirteenth Century (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001). Hahn notes that the depiction of the martyrs' suffering bodies made the images more accessible to the medieval reader who could thereby more fully experience their trials and better imitate their struggle. See for example the image of the flagellation of Quentin (ca. 1050-1100), Manuscrit de la Biblioth\u00e8que Municipal de Saint-Quentin. Eadem, 84, figure 25. 147 Augustine, as a divine tool that led to moral healing.337 Acts of faith, such as receiving the sacraments or visiting the tombs of the saints, could lead to physical cure in addition to their spiritual benefits.338 Christ himself was known as the physician who provided the medication--the holy Eucharist--for both physical illness and spiritual salvation.339 Thus, while the figures depicted on this page are useful for visually conveying the knowledge necessary for performing a medical procedure, at the same time they reflect medieval Christian notions about the complicated relationship between the inward state of the body--either physical or moral--and the external projection of such a state.340 337 The type of suffering usually described in the Bible and Early Middle Ages is that of persecution or God's discipline. See for example, 2 Timothy 3:12 and Hebrews 12:7-11. Darrel W. Amundsen and Gary B. Ferngren, \"Medicine and Religion: Early Christianity through the Middle Ages,\" in Health/Medicine and the Faith Traditions: An Inquiry into Religion and Medicine, eds. Martin E. Marty & Kenneth L. Vaux (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1982), 93-132. 338 In the early Christian church, the anointing of a patient with oil was thought to confer a physical cure of disease. See the Epistle of James (5:14-15); Paul F. Palmer, \"The Purpose of Anointing the Sick: A Reappraisal,\" Journal of Theological Studies 19, 3 (1958): 309-344; R.J.S. Barrett-Lennard, Christian Healing after the New Testament: Some Approaches to Illness in the Second, Third, and Fourth Centuries (Lanham: University Press of America, 1994). 339 See Rudolph Arbesmann, \"The Concept of 'Christus \"Medical Allusions in the Works of St. Jerome,\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 25 (1914): 1-28. 340 It is possible that the images also relate to new ideas circulating in the twelfth century about the nature of the body and soul. The Timaeus, popular in the twelfth century, conveyed a materialist conception of the soul that was physically connected to the body. Like the body, it was made up of four elements that needed to be balanced and harmonized by reason. See Francis MacDonald Cornford, \"Introduction\" in Plato's Cosmology (London & New York: esp. at 6. See also Gab\u00f3r Betegh, \"Cosmological Ethics in the Timaeus and Early Stoicism,\" Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy 24 (2003): 273-302. A similar view appears in Hugh of St. Victor. See Boyd Taylor Coolman, \"Pulchrum esse: The Beauty of Scripture, the Beauty of the Soul, and the Art of Exegesis in Hugh of St. Victor,\" Traditio 58 (2003): 175-200. Christian theologians, such as William of St. Thierry, made efforts to reconcile these new understandings with traditional Christian beliefs. While maintaining the incorporeality of the soul, William posited its union with the body in terms of their complementarity and numerical parallels. He compared the body, composed of four elements, humours, and powers to the soul with its four cardinal virtues (considered spiritual \"elements\") and powers of its own. Pierre, \"William of St. Thierry's Views of the Human Body,\" 233-4. William's argument is not solely focused on parallels of \"four.\" He also compares a different set of three powers based in both the soul and the body. For other twelfth-century theories on the nature of the body and 148 The portrayal of the cautery patients on this page with their erratic postures, peculiar body doubles, lack of clinical setting, and schematic arrangement contributes to the multivalent discourse promoted by the manuscript, one that is simultaneously medical, theoretical, and moral. The miniature emphasizes the important conceptual ties between physical and spiritual health and provides material for meditatio on the integrated and harmonious body and soul. The schematic composition based on the number four, representative of harmony and unity, offers a further opportunity to contemplate both forms of human suffering, physical and moral, within the context of a divinely created, meaningful universe. 2.3b.3 Folio 9r: For gout, hernias, tumors of the knee, and hemorrhoids Folio 9r portrays the surgical remedies for four ailments affecting the lower body: hernias, hemorrhoids, tumors of the knee, and gout (fig. 117). Two of these illustrations depict cautery procedures. The first is placed at the top right corner, where a man wearing only a cape bears cautery marks for a hernia (\"herniosi ita\").341 The depiction in Harley 1585 clearly shows the patient's sexual organs. The second cautery patient has been placed in the bottom left corner of the page and depicts the burn marks for tumors and other problems with the knees (\"Ad tumorem & dolorem geniculorum\"). While this treatment appears in four soul, see Bernard McGinn, \"Introduction,\" in Three Treatises on Man: Cistercian Publications, 1977), 1-93, 19-27. 341 This ailment is not mentioned in Paris, BnF, lat. 7028 nor in Laurenziana 73.41 but is found in the Ambrosianus D 2 under the name \"ponderosus\" and with similar burn marks. Once again, it is possible that Harley 1585 is presenting new terminology for the procedure, for a variant of the term is used in the Pantegni and in later medical books. The term is also found in the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript (\"Yrnia\"). 149 other cautery manuscripts, in those cases it always includes procedures for the feet and, in some cases, the hands and the chest.342 The illustrations for gout (podagra)343 and hemorrhoids (emoroida) are the earliest extant images of such surgeries. While the inscription for the hemorrhoid procedure prescribes only cutting (emoroida inciditur sic), the procedure for podagra involves both cutting and burning (podagricus inciditur et incenditur sic). While blood is shown issuing from the feet indicating cutting for bloodletting, no cautery marks appear on the patient's body. The cautery text in the late eleventh-century manuscript, Paris, BnF, lat. 7028 (\"BnF 7028\") describes a burning and cutting remedy for tumors and other problems of the foot but not specifically for podagra.344 Constantine the African's Viaticum also has a large section 342 It is Laurenziana to include the procedure for feet possibly relates to the importance placed on the podagra treatment. 343 The word podagra is derived from the Greek pous, foot, and agra, meaning trap. The Greeks believed that the disease was caused by excessive humours that drip into the joints, which in this case is the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Hippocrates describes some of the epidemiological features of gout in his work, Aphorisms. Here, he states that women do not get gout before menopause (29) nor do men before puberty (3). He also says that eunuchs never develop the symptom of gout. Caelius Aurelianus (first century AD) noted a link between gout and excessive eating and drinking, but his works were not available to twelfth-century authors in the West. Other medical writers such as Soranus of Ephesus, Rufus of Ephesus and Jacob Psychristus and Alexander Tralles also discussed various features of gout. See P. Marson and G. Pasero, \"Some Historical Remarks on Microcrystalline Arthritis (Gout and Chondrocalcinosis),\" Reumatismo 63, 4 (2011): 199-20. A treatise by Rufus of Epheseus De podagra, was translated into Latin probably in seventh-century Ravenna. For more on this work, see Pierre Courcelle, Late Latin Writers and Their Greek Sources, trans. Harry E. Wedeck (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1969), Pr\u00fcfening depicts only a cautery procedure for \"podagricus\" and there are burn marks at the ankles and under the knees (fol. 92v). 150 on gout, but there is no medical procedure that involves cutting.345 The textual tradition for hemorrhoids is more varied with procedures usually involving medicinal therapies, cautery, or ligation.346 A cutting treatment for hemorrhoids is mentioned in BnF 7028, though Harley's illustration does not follow the BnF 7028 text, which calls for the patient to \"sit on a high stool.\"347 Thus, Harley 1585's medical procedures for podagra and emoroidae seem to offer new and unique cures.348 Once again, there are odd visual features of the page. The image itself is organized in a non-symmetrical chiastic manner, or an (awkward) inverted cross or \"x\" shape. In the upper left corner, a disembodied hand emerges from a wavy orb of red, green, and white and 345 For the Viaticum, see Long, \"Body and Soul,\" 91. It is possible that treatments became more available for gout in the twelfth century because Alexander of Tralles's (d. early seventh century) treatise, De podagra, also reappears and begins to circulate in the mid-eleventh century. De podagra was originally book twelve of Tralles's Therapeutica. The Latin Alexander Trallianus; The Text and Transmission of a Late Latin Medical Book, Journal of Roman Studies Monograph 10 (London: Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, 2006). Valerie Knight is in the process of preparing a critical edition of the work. 346 Ancient sources mention many options for the treatment of hemorrhoids including medicines, cautery (Hippocrates), and operations involving ligation (Paul of Aegina and Celsus). None of these texts describe what is pictured in the image. Laufman, \"The History of Hemorrhoids,\" 384, also claims that the hemorrhoid operation depicted in Harley is derived from Aetius of Amida, a sixth-century doctor and possibly a court-physician under Emperor Justinian. This is largely due to one of the instruments depicted, a hook or clawed separator, which is also mentioned in Aetius's work, Tetrabiblus. Aetius's description of the operation, however, does not include the patient standing in such a position. For a translation of the Aetius text related to a hemorrhoid operation, see Plinio Prioreschi, A History of Medicine: Byzantine and Islamic Medicine (Omaha: Horatio Press, 2001), 53-57. 347 The textual version of the operation in BnF 7028 (fol. lupinis maceratis (hemorrhoids you cut as follows. Have the patient sit on a high chair as well as in front of a stool and force him firmly so that the hemorrhoids come out. You are standing under the seat and with a [hook] grab the hemorrhoids and cut them off right next to the [intestine.] Be careful not to take anything away from the gut. Then sprinkle powder of crushed wolf bean), translation based on De Moulin, De heelkunde, 100-102. 151 offers a substance directly into the mouth of the podagra patient. Large painted nails pierce through this patient's feet and the painted tool used for the treatment, a mallet, is placed beside the body. Neither would be considered normal medical instruments and no other depiction of bloodletting includes such tools.349 In the lower right corner, a large box, with a lightly drawn cross shape inside, breaks through the border of the page and a patient, standing on a large cup, leans over it in a strange beast-like position that cannot be accounted for by medical descriptions of the procedure (fig. 118). The blood emerging from the bodies of two patients is caught in two ornate vessels and, in the case of the podagra patient, the vessel is held by another patient. No surviving cautery illustration, apart from the copies of Harley 1585, has such features. There have been several attempts to provide reasons for these odd features, though they are mostly unsatisfactory. For example, the material offered by the disembodied hand has been called a type of surgical anesthesia, or a soporific sponge;350 the cross in the box was deemed the mistake of a medically uninformed monastic artist;351 and the cup on which the hemorrhoid patient stands was described as one used in bloodletting (fig. 1).352 Peter 349 Note however that the use of nails may have been gleaned from the text of the Pantegni. In describing cautery procedures for podagra and \"sciaticorum,\" Chapter 85 instructs the surgeon to use a cautery iron whose tip (capite) is similar to a nail (clavum) and to cut the skin (et sic cutis perforetur) so that the moisture drains out or is removed (humiditas excludatur). Constantine the African, Chirurgia, Ch. 85, 64. 350 Loren MacKinney, Medical Illustrations in Medieval Manuscripts (London: Wellcome Historical Medical Library, 1965), 53. For more information on the soporific sponge, see Willem F. Historical-Phenomenological Study of Bodily Pain in Western Man,\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 48, 4 (1974): 540-570, at 558 describes the sponge as mostly legendary and likely of Greek origin. 351 De Moulin, De heelkunde, 117. 352 See for example the vessel used in the bloodletting scene on an ancient Greek vase, Paris, Mus\u00e9e Louvre (ca. 500 B.C.) in Sudhoff, Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Chirurgie, vol. 1, figure 8. The 152 Jones has more readily acknowledged the Christian content of the folio but did not provide a reason or meaning for such allusions.353 It is my contention that these are intentional features of the manuscript. They allude to Christ's Passion and provide a conclusion to the visual arguments of the two previous folios. Not only does the illustration reveal a salvific understanding of human physical pain and the moral dimensions of the body but it also suggests the ultimate cure or redemption found in the Eucharist. The four procedures further serve to integrate these concepts into a harmonious unity. The top left procedure for podagra contains clear iconographical elements that refer to the Crucifixion (fig. 119). The \"nails\" that graphically penetrate the feet of the podagra patient are like those that pierced the feet of Christ. Often the instruments of Christ's torture are depicted alongside his body (fig. 120) and in Harley the mallet appears next to the patient.354 Another iconographical trope is suggested by the action of the knee patient below who collects the blood that trickles from the feet of the podagra sufferer in a cup-like vessel. Many images of the Crucifixion show Mary or another follower holding out a pyxis and catching the precious blood of Christ that emerges after he is struck by a lance on his side (figs. 121-122).355 There are even images of the blood from the pierced feet of Christ being collected in a chalice below (fig. 123).356 Earlier scholars have interpreted the Harley action depicted bowl, however, is only shown in scenes of phlebotomy. It is not clear what happened to the blood produced in cutting or cautery procedures. 353 \"Image, Word, and Medicine in the Middle Ages,\" in Visualizing Medieval Medicine and Natural History, 1200-1550, eds. Jean A. Givens, Karen Reeds, and Alain Touwaide (Burlington, VT: fol. 300r Abbey of St. Peter, Salzburg). 356 London, BL, Egerton MS 608, fol. 88r. 153 medically, claiming that the knee patient is about to apply an \"ointment\" or \"a dauber soaked in corrosives,\" a kind of medical remedy, to the bleeding feet.357 Yet, there is no evidence of such a dauber on the page nor do any other medieval medical images show a patient acting as a doctor and administering this remedy. Instead, the illustration makes the podagra patient Christ-like. Not only does he suffer a similar torture by virtue of the nails but, like the middle patient on folio 8r, he also responds passively with an accepting and humble gesture. His left arm bends so that his left hand is on his chest, while the other, partially obscured, is placed face up on the bench. His humility is rewarded by the hand reaching out of the wavy orb, which in contemporary manuscripts signifies the presence of God. This visual element is often depicted above the Crucifixion to signify God's blessing or in other examples to show his presence (fig. 124). Here it indicates that the Christ-like podagra patient has been healed.358 Another way the podagra patient can be compared to Christ is by a visual comparison to images of Job, who in the twelfth century became an important example of imitatio Christi.359 The story of Job concerns a prosperous and blameless man who is suddenly 357 MacKinney, Medical Illustrations, 53. 358 See London, BL, Arundel MS 60, fol. 12v (eleventh century, England); and the Gospels of Judith of Flanders, New York, Pierpont Morgan Library, MS M 709, fol. 1v (eleventh century, England) in Schiller, Iconography, 2: figure 388. 359 For Gregory the Great, Job was typologically related to Christ in that his story foreshadows Christ's life. In particular, Gregory acknowledged Job's patience and humility as a model for human life. Kevin Hester, Eschatology and Pain in St. Gregory the Great: The Christological Synthesis of Gregory's Morals on the Book of Job (Eugene, OR: Wipf & Stock, 2008), 57-59. By the twelfth century, Job's personal suffering was the focus of his link to Christ. Gamble L. Madsen, \"Look upon My Affliction (Job 10:15): The Depiction of Job in the Western Middle Ages,\" in A Companion to Job in the Middle Ages, ed. Franklin T. Harkins and Aaron Canty (Leiden & Boston: Brill, 2016), 289-323. 154 afflicted by many disasters that take away all he has, including his health. Twelfth-century illustrations show Job covered with sores and a few even depict him sitting below a wavy orb identified with God (figs. 125-126).360 The story tells us that Satan is the agent of these disasters and describes one of Job's afflictions as being \"pierced (percussit) with a dreadful ulcer from the sole of his foot to the top of his head.\"361 This torture of Job is portrayed visually in manuscripts such as the twelfth-century Worms Bible, but with an emphasis on the foot (fig. 127).362 In addition to ulcers appearing all over Job's body, a devil pierces his right foot with a long lance. Like the podagra patient, after enduring such physical trials and developing humility, Job is ultimately physically healed directly by God. The podagra illustration, however, does not just depict a physical healing; it alludes to moral healing as well. The image bears a striking visual likeness to an event in the book of Isaiah (6:6-7), in which the prophet has a vision wherein a seraphim takes a burning coal from the Lord's altar and touches it to Isaiah's mouth, thus redeeming him from wickedness and sin.363 While early medieval illustrations of this scene usually depict a multi-winged seraphim who holds the coal using tongs (fig. 128),364 a twelfth-century example more 360 See Navarra, capital of the former Romanesque cloister of the Cathedral with scenes from the book of Job (ca. 1145), in Madsen, \"Look upon my Affliction,\" figures 10.4 and 10.7. In the Douai manuscript, the figure in the wavy orb is identified as \"Elihu\" who, according to some commentaries, speaks for God. He tells Job that one of the ways God reveals himself to humans is through physical suffering (Job Frankenthal?) 363 \"Then one of the seraphim flew to me, holding an ember which he had taken with tongs from the altar. He touched my mouth with it. 'See,' he said, 'now that this has touched your lips, your wickedness is removed, your sin is purged.\" 364 See for example, the wall painting in the Apse of Santa Maria d'\u00c0neu, now at the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (end of the eleventh, beginning of the twelfth century). 155 clearly resembles the portrayal in Harley. A wall painting in the south choir of St. Martin's Church in Nohan-Vicq, France, shows a large being whose torso is obstructed by concentric lines--similar to Harley's wavy orb (fig. 129). 365 Also like Harley, the being uses his hand, instead of tongs, to place a coal onto the lips of a seated Isaiah. Both De Moulin and Jones have pointed out this relationship, but their explanations are not wholly satisfactory. For De Moulin this parallel had only a medical meaning: just as Isaiah was healed by the burning coal, so too a patient is healed by the doctor's cautery tool.366 Jones, for his part, calls the association purely metonymic. He interprets the box in the lower right-hand corner of the page as a brazier used to heat up cautery irons and argues that its appearance suggested the hot coal of Isaiah.367 For Jones there is no medical meaning, only monastic associative reasoning taken too far. Jones is likely right about the association between heated cautery irons and Isaiah's coal, but I would argue that the association was intentional and related to the conflation of physical and moral disease that is found in Harley 1585 according to the interpretation offered in this thesis.368 As for De Moulin's argument, while a medical cure is indicated by the inscription, the depiction of cure is not medical--the 365 Marcia Kupfer, \"Spiritual Passage and Pictorial Strategy in the Romanesque Frescos at Vicq,\" The Art Bulletin 68, 1 (1986): 35-53, figure 5. Kupfer, 46, argues that the being is an angel instead of a seraphim due to the type of wing that peaks out from behind the orb; however, because these types of lines usually indicate God or at least divine presence, it is unclear what the Nohant-Vicq image portrays. See also a similar image in the Winchester Bible, Winchester Cathedral Library, fol. 148. The latter illustration, however, depicts Jeremiah 1:9, \"And the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth: and the Lord said to me: Behold I have given my words in thy mouth.\" This action is often compared to the live coal given to Isaiah. 366 De Moulin, De heelkunde, 116. 367 \"Image, Word, and Medicine,\" 5. 368 To some extent podagra is identified as a \"moral\" disease, linked to over-eating. See also Hippocrates's Aphorisms where he lists those more and less likely to develop such symptoms. 156 patient is not shown being cured by a doctor or by any tool considered medical. Here, a different kind of cure is illustrated, for God directly heals the patient and, by virtue of the illustration's allusion to Isaiah, the disease is not only physical but also one of the soul. Thus, this one image contains multiple allusions: to physical disease and divine medical cure; to Job who as a prototype of Christ is (ultimately) physically healed by God; and to Isaiah whose moral disease was cured by God through the mediation of a cautery-like burning. Once again Harley 1585 connects moral and physical disease via bodily signs and reminds the reader of the supreme agent of cure, namely, God. There are other examples on this page where the depictions of patients might be interpreted as referring to their moral health and to God as healing agent. The patient in the lower left corner who stands facing forward, fully dressed and catching blood in a container (fig. 117)--a position like that of Mary and Ecclesia in comparable images (figs. 121-122)--contrasts with the two figures on the right side of the page whose genitals are prominently displayed. The patient on the top right even gestures away from the hand of God on the left as if refusing his offered cure. Also turning away from the hand of God is the hemorrhoid patient on the bottom left of the folio. Besides being in an odd position that is not described in the textual version of the procedure, his body is depicted as animal-like (cf. fig. 130).369 As discussed above, portrayals of hybrid, monstrous creatures or human figures with genitals exposed were often intended to convey a message of sin and immorality, while the properly clothed and upright express moral rectitude. 369 The Arnstein Bible, London, BL, Harley MS 2799, fol. 243r (twelfth century, Premonstratentian abbey of St Mary and St Nicholas, Arnstein). These are depictions of the \"monstrous\" races, some of which are hybrids. 157 Besides the hand of God, the folio also presents evidence of another divine cure--the symbols of the sacramental Eucharist. By the twelfth century, especially in the region around Li\u00e8ge where Harley 1585 was produced, the bread and wine of the liturgy was theologically understood to contain the real corporeal presence of God, whose consumption was necessary for salvation.370 All the tools necessary for the Mass can be found on fol. 9r. First, the box and its interior decoration resembles an altar, the site of consecration (fig. 131; cf. fig. 132).371 Though lightly drawn, the interior cross is intentional and the box even breaks through the border of the illustration, as if meant to symbolize the place where the divine and worldly meet; it is not bound by earthly limitations like the other figures on the page.372 Second, the chalice to hold the blood of Christ appears as the stool on which the patient stands (perhaps amplifying his desecration of the sacrament). Finally, the mysterious item placed in the mouth of the podagra patient may also represent reception of the body of Christ. 370 Gary Macy, Treasures from the Storeroom: Medieval Religion and the Eucharist (Collegeville: Liturgical Press, 1999), 144; and idem, The Theologies of the Eucharist in the Early Scholastic Period (New York: Clarendon Press & Oxford University Press, 1984), 64-70, 122-23. See also John H. Van Egen, Rupert of Deutz (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983). 371 The general form can be compared to the altar front in the Basilica Sant'Ambrogio (ninth century) in Milan. 372 I would like to thank the British Library for allowing me to view the manuscript. My investigation determined that the cross on the altar was formed in a few ways: first from the border of the following fol. 9v, which, due to the thin parchment, appears on 9r; and second from two parallel horizontal lines that were drawn across the altar. Note that these lines do not cross the inner vertical lines but stop at their borders. In addition, there seem to be small circles running down the vertical border and along the right side of the horizontal arm - neither of which appear on the following page (i.e., they are not a bleed through). Another way that we know that these drawings were not later additions is that one late twelfth-century copy of Harley, Sloane 1975, fol. 93r, clearly depicts a cross within the box. Unfortunately, the page on which this procedure might have been placed has been cut out of Ashmole 1462, the other copy of Harley. 158 Peter Jones concluded that \"the artists of these early series of surgical operations [on folio 9r] were far more concerned to transmit to posterity the images they found in manuscripts older still than to convey any practical information about the details of surgical technique.\"373 Jones is partially right. Whether or not the images are copies of older ones, it is true that they are not concerned with practical medical details but instead with something larger: the salvific function of suffering for both the body and soul; the conception of \"cure,\" both medical and divine; and the place of suffering and cure within the divinely created, harmonious world. Instead of misunderstood details, all the \"mistakes\" on the page can be explained as allusions to these ideas and were meant to inspire the reader to imitate Christ, accept the suffering of life with patience and humility, and look forward to the definitive cure of salvation. 2.3b.4 Folio 9v: For cataracts and nasal polyps; and Book 3: The \"Epistula ad Maecenatem\" After the previous folio's complex interweaving of ideas about suffering, blood, sacrifice, moral disease, and medical and spiritual healing, it is a surprise to turn the page to folio 9v (fig. 133). This folio contains two unpainted images of cautery procedures, and each includes a doctor, a feature that appears only twice in the three prior folios, and various medical tools. In addition, the two illustrations seem to be randomly placed on the page. There is no symmetry or border to separate the procedures, just one grouping on top of the other. The lack of ornamentation and the inclusion of several medical features suggests a 373 Jones, Medieval Medical Miniatures, 102. But he does go on to suggest that these manuscripts were owned by monastic houses and that monks may have performed some small surgical procedures, although most likely there were laymen who performed these tasks. He also notes that some abbots received surgical training, for example, Warin, Abbot of St. Albans (d. 1195), received training at Salerno and so too did his successor, John of Cella, at Paris. 159 return to practical medicine and links it to the image of a seated Hippocrates on folio 7v. These two illustrations bookend the painted images of surgery, and this arrangement suggests that a Christology lies hidden within the \"books\" of Hippocrates. In general, the choice to illuminate a manuscript with colourful images could be linked to the wealth of the patron, for the materials and time needed added considerable cost. Paint could also draw attention to the importance of the material illuminated, especially in manuscripts where not all images received such treatment. An example is found in the tenth-century Benedictional of Aethelwold, where the bishop is portrayed in full colour preaching at the altar while the lay worshippers below are unpainted, thus distinguishing the figures' relative status and roles (fig. 134).374 Similarly, the cautery illustrations in Harley 1585 likely have received the special treatment of colour because they contain allusions to theological and philosophical ideas that were considered important to emphasize. This is not the only instance in the Harley manuscript of paint being used to draw attention to a particular figure or idea. In the herbal section the only plants that have painted backgrounds are betonica (betony, fol.14r), associated with special healing powers and to which one text is dedicated, and columbaria (fol. 18v), also meaning \"dove,\" a symbol of the Holy Spirit (figs. 135-136). As for figural images, the mythological scene of the goddess Diana transmitting knowledge of the herb arthemisia to Chiron the centaur has no background paint (folio 22r, fig. 137) whereas the illustration of a boy caring for an elderly patient (and associated with the herb columbaria) does (folio 19r, fig. 138). The choice to paint the background seems to be a visual tool signaling the importance of the image, its 374 London, BL, Add. MS 49598, fol. (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995), 139-146, figure 35. Other examples include London, BL, Arundel MS fol. fol. 1r. 160 Christological allusions, and the need for the associative thinking of monastic meditatio to understand its full meaning. The unpainted images of surgery, for their part, only show examples of practical medicine. The first procedure on folio 9v is for albule (whitening or cataracts) of the eyes and the second for nasal polyps. At the top of the page, a doctor performs a couching operation. He holds a thin object up to a patient's eye with his right hand, and with the other holds onto the shoulder of the patient who carries a lidded vase, most likely meant to represent a post-operative ointment.375 The second operation is for nasal polyps. Here a doctor holds the appropriate tools, a knife for cutting the polyp and a pipe, which, according to Peter Jones, would have been used after the surgery to blow a special healing powder into the nostril.376 The patient holds a bowl, presumably for catching blood from the cutting procedure. In contrast to the hemorrhoid operation on the previous page, no blood appears, and the unpainted bowl represents a bowl used for bloodletting, rather than a chalice for the mass.377 Again, the artist emphasizes the practical medical nature of these surgeries rather than their connection to Christian theology. 375 Jones, Medieval Medical Miniatures, 98. 376 Jones, Medieval Medical Miniatures, 98. Note that the Pantegni describes surgery for the removal of a nasal polyp, but it involves a type of ligation instead of the cutting depicted in Harley. 377 Sudhoff, Ein Beitr\u00e4ge zur Geschichte der Chirurgie, 11-16. Sudhoff links these two cutting surgeries along with the one for hemorrhoids on fol. 9r to a (lost) model from Late Antiquity. There are other visual details that link all the surgical images to Late Antiquity, in particular the small circular detail found on the cloth worn by the patients and doctors. This ornamentation is not found in the copies of Harley and I have only found similar examples on the seventh-century Byzantine David Plates, New York, The Metropolitan Museum, accession number 17.190.399, https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/464380. For more information on the David Plates, see Ruth E. Leader, \"The David Plates Revisited: Transforming the Secular in Early Byzantium,\" The Art Bulletin 82, 3 (2000): 407-427. Note that while Sudhoff's argument is limited to the illustrations of surgical cutting, he does not mention the cutting procedure for gout that is both described using the verb incide (cut) and shown on folio 9r. Instead, he focuses on the three cutting procedures in which doctors appear and calls them the \"Operationsbildersgruppe aus der Antike.\" His interpretation is 161 In their insistence on a medical interpretation as well as their lack of paint, these surgical images mirror the illustration of a seated Hippocrates on folio 7v.378 The fact that cataract patient holds a medication also links the action of the discipulus, who grinds the materials in a large container required for such a therapy. The mirror characterization carries further to the two books that respectively lay before and after the pair of unpainted illustrations: the De quattuor humores text and another pseudo-Hippocratic text, the Epistula ad Maecenatem (fols.10r-12r).379 The latter work also discusses the four humours but also based on the surgical images in Sloane 1975, a later copy of Harley 1585, which he believed to be the earliest manuscript. In Sloane, the three images appear together (and alone) on a single folio, 93r. See also Jones, Medieval Medical Miniatures, 99. 378 There is no codicological reason for these two illustrations to remain unpainted, as, for example, if they were on the same bifolium that may have been misplaced until a later binding. Instead, both have painted images on another side of the folio (fol. 12v and 9r are painted). See Appendix C for a codicological review of the Hippocratic preface. Jones has stated that the unpainted folios in Harley were due to an artistic mistake; the intention was to paint the folio, but for some practical reason it was not completed. There is some evidence for Jones's position; for example, there is pencil border around the bottom inscription \"fungeus de nare sic inciditur.\" This border may indicate that the scribe was showing the artist where to stop the background paint. Yet no border surrounds the top inscription. Was a later decision made to forego the background paint? There certainly is some 3v, ninth century). In later manuscripts, the letter is attributed to Galen (Cambridge, Gonville and Caius College Library, MS BnF, lat. 15456, fol. 163v, thirteenth century). It is also often found in combination with the Pseudo-Apuleius Complex, however its placement in Harley, between surgical procedures and a Prayer to the Earth Goddess, has no precedent. Based on the descriptions of Beccaria, the letter is usually found at or near the beginning of a manuscript and immediately before De herba vettonica liber (six out of the ten cases). It is also found once before the Herbarius and once with the rubric Incipit Galen's Ad are two pertinent exceptions, Laurenziana 73.41 (which we have discussed in relation to cautery images) and Wroclaw, Biblioteka Uniwersytecka, Codex III F 19, both of which place the letter before an unillustrated Prayer to the Earth Goddess. In the codex from Wroclaw, the Epistle is the first treatise after the index, and the manuscript has no cautery images; and in Laurenziana 73.41, it is placed after the index with cautery images at the end of the book. Oddly, Collins, Medieval Herbals, 162, states that the letter usually is placed so that it refers to the De herbis femininis, because it refers to figure.\" I can find no evidence of this placement before the twelfth century. 162 adds material on other \"fours,\" such as a discussion of the four qualities of a body and the signs of illness in its four parts. It ends with a dinamis herbarum, or a type of pharmaceutical text, which again connects the text to the image of Hippocrates and the youth in the process of creating a medication. 380 Together these texts and the unpainted images bookend the colourful surgical illustrations in between.381 My contention is that this feature visually suggests that a Christology was hidden within the \"books\" of Hippocrates--and a Christology that could only be uncovered through visual exegesis. It is important to place this strategy within the twelfth-century attempts to reconcile Christianity with the new translations of Greek learning, accomplished mostly by textual means.382 Harley 1585 is not the only attempt to visually Christianize the writings of Hippocrates. Another example is also found in the twelfth-century wall paintings within the Cathedral crypt of Anagni, Italy. In this architectural context, a converse exegetical approach occurs. Here, a depiction of 380 For more on the nature of medieval dinamida, see Loren C. MacKinney, \"'Dynamidia' in Medieval Medical Literature,\" Isis 24.2 (1936). Another interesting feature of the letter is that it claims to offer medical remedies that do not require the expertise of a doctor (his the aim was to teach medical knowledge at a basic level using elementary explanations, which was partially a function of the letter form.

These images and text have intrigued scholars because of their puzzling content and execution. The illustrations are more intricately rendered than any other in the manuscript. Gold is used for the first time\u2014in both the script and in the borders of the illustrations\u2014and the text is laid out in a single column, differentiating it from all the other texts in the manuscript384 and deviating from the standard two columns of most twelfth-century library texts (including sacred works which were previously in a single column).385 These images and the intervening text have been intentionally highlighted by the artist, although the text is neither medical nor Christian, but 383 Martina Bagnoli, \"The Medieval Frescoes in the Crypt of the Duomo of Anagni,\" Ph.D. Dissertation, The Johns Hopkins University, 1998, 48-77. Other examples include a haloed Hippocrates in the twelfth-century manuscript, Berlin, Medizinische Sammelhandschrift, Ms. lat. qu. 198, fol. 10v, and the thirteenth-century illustration of Hippocrates seated and writing in the guise of an evangelist in Vienna, \u00d6sterreichische Nationalbibliothek, Cod. 93, fol. 119r. 384 It is possible that the gold inner border was added on top of a red border. My examination of the manuscript allowed me to see red in places where the gold is rubbing off, for example, on the top left-hand corner. The \"D\" does not appear to have red underneath. 385 The standard column layout for verse (including prose verse) was in a single column.

See also Kurt Weitzmann, Illustrations in Roll and Codex: A Study of the Origin and Method of Text Illustration (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1947). 164 rather the Precatio terrae\u2014a prayer to a pagan earth goddess--in Harley 1585, they are meaningfully attributed to Hippocrates. This text and a second prayer, a Prayer to all Herbs on the following page (folio 13v), are not unusual elements in the Pseudo-Apuleius Complex. In fact, they are included in Howald and Sigerist's type \u00df classification, the category into which Harley has been placed.386 Yet no earlier extant type \u00df manuscript includes illustrations. Most only provide introductory rubrics for each prayer (figs. 141-142).387 In Harley 1585 the prayer to the earth goddess has been singled out, written in gold ink and surrounded by the two illustrations. The text of this prayer comprises two parts. 388 The first is in the form of poetry and praises the power and greatness of the Earth, who is the \"parent of the products of nature,\" generator of \"all things,\" \"the divine governor of all in the sky and sea,\" the \"restorer of the light,\" and the one who \"drive[s] off the night.\"389 The second part of the prayer, in the form of prose, is a personal plea from the writer who asks for the power to heal using herbs.390 386 Howald and Sigerist name thirty-five herbal manuscripts from the entire Middle Ages that contain this text. Corpus Medicorum Latinorum, x-xvii. For more information about the origin and transmission of the prayers, see John McEnerney, 184. The earliest extant copy of the prayers is from the sixth or seventh century and found in an Italian manuscript now located in the Netherlands, Leiden Bibliotheek der Rijksuniversiteit, Vossianus Latinus Q 9. see Baehrens, Miscellanea Critica, 108. 389 The translation is by Faith Wallis, Medieval Medicine: A Reader (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010), 70-71. Scholars assert that the composition of the second prayer, to all herbs, was already influenced by Christianity. McEnerney, \"Precatio Terrae,\" 184, points out that the verb \"creare\" is not used with Nature as the subject (as it was in Lucretius, 1.56, 2.1150ff. and 5.822-3, where the fruits of the field are ascribed to Nature). Instead, the verb used with Nature is \"to beget.\" \"Creare\" is reserved for God. 390 \"Your majesty generates every kind of herb for the sake of healing, bestowing them on every race. Give to me this medicine of yours. Come to me with your powers. Whatever I do with this, may the 165 It is the second part of the prayer that has led most scholars to interpret both figures on folios 12v and 13r as doctors. 391 Heidi Grape-Albers described the first, on the top half of folio 12v, as a doctor supplicating the earth and asking for the power to heal.392 Indeed, we see a bearded figure who bends over with his head down and both palms facing upwards as if in prayer. To support this interpretation of the Harley illustration, Grape-Albers offered two comparable images from the thirteenth century which are also associated with the Precatio terrae text.393 Both thirteenth-century works depict a man on bended knee, but this time in front of a personified earth goddess (figs. 143-144). Her argument is that the two thirteenth-century images were based on complete late antique originals, while Harley's model was faulty. In the purported Harley model, the personified image of the earth may have been removed due to \"Christian zeal\" and thus the Harley scribe was unable to copy the full image.394 While Grape-Albers is likely correct that Harley used a late antique model, her argument rests on the assumption that medieval artists merely copied what was before them. Instead, most scholars today allow that medieval artists made iconographical choices to meet contemporary needs. The result of Grape-Albers assumption is that she ignores some of the outcome be good.

Now, goddess, I appeal to you; may your majesty grant to me what I, a supplicant, ask.\" Wallis, Medieval Medicine, 70-71. 391 Other scholars have noted their stylistic connections to Late Antique, Byzantine art. See Ayers, \"A Miniature from Jumi\u00e8ges,\" 115-40. Minta Collins, Medieval Herbals, 205-207, links the illustrations to the work of Meuse Valley goldsmiths, who were in turn influenced by Byzantine work. 392 Sp\u00e4tantike Bilder aus der Welt des Arztes, 149.

These details, for example, need explanation. Why is the bearded man placed at the far right of the page, with his head, one foot and both hands piercing through the border as if to escape the frame? The only other instance of boundary breaking in Harley 1585 is on folio 9r with the altar. What is the meaning of the four bands of colour (approximately 2 cm each) behind the bearded man, and why is he dressed in an unadorned toga, which is different from the dress of the other doctors (and authors) in Harley, not to mention the thirteenth-century comparanda? And finally, why is there a halo surrounding his head? Several scholars have noted the halo and characterized him as a \"Christ-like\" doctor.395 Others have called him a saintly doctor, and the British Library website proposes that he has the god-like ability to conjure the earth.396 While it is clear that the halo references sanctity, no halo is found associated with any other doctor or enthroned medical writer in the manuscript. So far, the manuscript has emphasized the sanctity of patients, not doctors. I would argue that the artist took features of a late antique model of a man, likely a medicus, who prayed to the earth goddess, and modified the image in order to create an image of God and, more specifically, God the Father in the act of Creation. Images of God the Father (the first person of the trinity and considered a purely transcendent being) are relatively uncommon in the Early Middle Ages.397 Instead, artistic 395 Collins, Medieval Herbals, 206. 396 Jones, Medieval Medical Miniatures, 98. See also, \"Harley MS 1585,\" British Library website, last accessed February 24, 2019, http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Harley_MS_1585. 397 For more information on the issues surrounding the visual depiction of God, see Herbert Kessler, Spiritual Seeing: Picturing God's Invisibility in Medieval Art (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000). 167 depictions of divinity showed Christ, who assumed bodily form and who was identified by the cross within his halo. The Father does make his presence felt, but more commonly through the wavy orbs and depictions of his hand as shown in Harley on folio 9r. Beginning in the ninth century, bodily images of God the Father became more widely acceptable with artists generally using Old Testament prophets, usually bearded and wearing a toga, as models.398 By the twelfth century, the Father in bodily form became even more common and was often found in scenes of the Creation.399 In Harley, the man on folio 12v has many characteristics in common with earlier and contemporary depictions of God the Father, and these explain the seemingly odd features of the image. The unadorned toga and halo evoke a heavenly figure. A close examination of the manuscript reveals that the halo was created by means of small unpainted circles and was planned from the outset, for no border or background paint intrudes into its space. Examples of this method for creating a halo can be found in other contemporary manuscripts and some from the Li\u00e8ge region (figs. 145-146).400 In addition, when we consider the context in which the figure appears, there are some notable differences from other images in Harley 1585. Here the man stands on a golden border, befitting the divine scene, whereas all other standing 398 See of the Trinity: An Historical Survey NY: Arthur H. also Andr\u00e9 Grabar, Christian Iconography: A Study of Its Origins, trans. Terry Grabar (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1968). 400 Berlin Staatsbibliothek, Ms. lat. qu. 198, fol. 154 (twelfth century, N. Spain or S. France) and London, BL, Harley MS 2799, fol. 155r (1172, Arnstein Abbey). 168 figures in the manuscript simply float in space. Moreover, he is also shown penetrating that border, a feature often related to God's ability to transcend space and time. The illustration on folio 12v not only depicts God the Father but the Father in the context of Creation. My argument is based on both the iconographical cues in the image and the well-documented twelfth-century debates over the traditional understanding of Creation and a more scientific version. The new scientific understanding emerged from the adaptation of Neoplatonic ideas on causation from the Timaeus.401 The debate itself centered on the role of God. Did he create the four elements and allow them to do the work of creation as Neoplatonic theory held?402 Or did he create every being himself, that is, directly, as the Church Fathers emphasized? The former interpretation was deemed by traditional theologians to take Creation out of the history of salvation, while the new theorists claimed that the agency of the elements provided a better, more logical, explanation for the various stages of Creation.403 401 Marie-Dominique Chenu, \"Nature ou Chenu specifically mentions the debate between Hugh of St. Victor and William of Conches. 402 Wetherbee, W. Amundsen, \"Medicine and Faith in Early Christianity,\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 56, 3 (1982): 326-350, at 332. 403 These new theories focused on issues of causation and how the characteristics and powers of the elements could explain the various stages of Creation. See, for example, Thierry of Chartres, Tractatus de sex dierum operibus, in which he attempts to explain creation by physical factors, interpreting Genesis through the perspective of the Timeaus.

William of St. Thierry wrote De erroribus 169 Much of this debate was played out in illustrations with key features of images modified to place more or less emphasis on God's participation.404 Those images that supported a Neoplatonic version often showed God in a less involved role. For example, in the Genesis initial of the St. Hubert Bible, God remains static in the center of the page while the personified elements seem to do the work instead (fig. 147).405 In works that supported a more traditional view, God the Father actively and in full-bodily form participates in the work of Creation (fig. 148 and, in particular, 149).406 Not only did the number of Creation images dramatically increase in the twelfth century but the context in which they are found also expanded to non-biblical works, such as bestiaries and works on natural philosophy.407 Guilelmi de Conchis, condemning William for using physical arguments to explain Creation.

For an example of the contexts in which Creation images are found, see Honorius Augustodunensis's Clavis physicae, 3v. Also note that fol. 1v of the same manuscript shows an image of the World Soul as mentioned in the Timaeus. For bestiaries, see Oxford, Bodleian, MS. Ashmole 1511; Leningrad, Public Library, Ms. Q.v.V.I; and Aberdeen, University Library, Ms. 24. Note also that by the eleventh century, creation texts were also included computus manuscripts. For example, Hunter 100, discussed in chapter one, has a text on creation. 170 Harley's image of God the Father falls under the more traditional view, for he is shown as actively involved in the act of Creation, and certain iconographical cues even allude to particular days of Creation, namely the end of Day Two and the beginning of Day Three. According to Genesis, on Day Two God divides the waters so that a \"firmament\" is created between the \"waters\" which are \"above\" and \"under.\"408 Conrad Rudolph provides examples of the illustrations for this day that are comparable to the image in the Harley manuscript: one from the Gospels of Henry the Lion (fig. 150) and another from the Bible of Robert of Bello (fig. 151).409 In Harley 1585 and the Bible of Robert of Bello, God wears a long toga and in all three the \"waters\" are depicted as blue bands on the top and bottom while the firmament appears as a coloured band in the middle.410 The reason why God is placed in an odd position at the far right of the page in Harley 1585 is that the artist wants to show us that God has completed Day Two and is beginning Day Three, when the earth is created as well as the plants. 408 \"...God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so. And God called the firmament, Heaven\" (I: 6-7). There was much debate in the twelfth century as to whether the firmament could be \"above\" the waters. Theorists such as William of Conches claimed it did not make sense.

See also Paris, Ms. images in Zahlten, Creatio Mundi. 410 Collins argues that the bands of colour \"recall enamel work.\" Medieval Herbals, 206. 171 God also said: Let the waters that are under the heaven be gathered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it was so done. And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. And he said: Let the earth bring forth the green herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done. And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having seed each one according to its king. And God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day. 411 Notably, the two thirteenth-century illustrations noted by Grape-Albers also depict the third day of Creation. In both images, water is represented on the top and bottom, while the earth is in the middle and filled with trees. In those pictures, the personified image of the earth has performed the act of creation and is suitably supplicated by the doctor. In Harley 1585, the creator is God, who faces away from Day Two's division of the waters and the firmament and reaches down to bring the earth and plants into being. In the context of the twelfth-century controversy over God's role in Creation, the Harley manuscript's depiction of God the Father emphasizes his direct involvement, particularly in the creation of the earth and plants--and thereby in the materials required for medicinal cures.412 This depiction also seems intended to adjust or correct the idea in the first precationes that the earth (one of the four elements) created the world. It also explains why only the first precationes is highlighted in the manuscript, for the second refers to God as the 411 Genesis 1: 9-13. 412 Compare to the images of God using a compass to create the world. For example, Bible moralis\u00e9e, Vienna, Ost. Nationalbibliothek MS 2554, fol. 1v. H. Tachau, \"God's Compass and Vana Curiositas: Scientific Study in the Old French Bible Moralis\u00e9e,\" The Art Bulletin 80 (1998): 7-33. 172 creator and not the earth or Nature.413 This argument is also supported by the mis-en-page of folios 12v and 13r, where the text of the prayer is cut in half by the placement of the images, thereby visually severing the power of the text and placing more importance on the images. In addition, the placement of text and image also visually creates four distinct units: illustration, text, text, illustration. God not only independently creates all within the cosmos, but he also does so with the harmonious character that the number four represents. The second image on folio 13r connects the prayers and their Christian meaning to Hippocrates. Earlier manuscripts, such as the ninth-century Pseudo Apuleius Complex in Laurenziana, 73.41--which also contains the earliest extant images of cautery-- attribute the Precatio text to Antonius Musa, a medical author and supposed physician to Emperor Augustus.414 No such attribution appears in Harley and other evidence links the figure instead to Hippocrates. First, the text that the Harley figure holds can be attributed to him. The scroll reads, Quem admodum the solution to fullness, so is fullness the solution to emptiness). This maxim found in Hippocrates's Aphorisms, a text widely available in the early Middle Ages.415 It is also found in the Hippocratic text, On the Nature of Man, where it expands the idea, claiming 413 McEnerney, \"Precatio Terrae,\" 185-6. 414 The attribution, in all capital letters, is found in the explicit of the text in Laurenziana, 415 Long notes that the Hippocratic work, Aphorisms, was translated by one of the students of Alfanus (archbishop of Salerno 1058-1085). \"Body and Soul,\" 91. For the activity of Alfanus, who may have brought the text back from Constantinople, see Giles Gasper and Faith Wallis, \"Anselm and the Articella,\" Traditio 59 (2004): 129-174. 173 that all medicine could be reduced to this very principle.416 In addition, there are similarities between this illustration and that on folio 7v (fig. 140, cf. fig. 94). In both cases, the man is not identified, but both wear Byzantine-style clothing (unlike the first, the second figure does not wear a hat), both are seated on a plinth, and both hold scrolls with cloth-covered hands. Also like the medical author on folio 7v, the figure on folio 13r twists and stares intensely towards his left (and our right) and his right hand extends outward in the gesture of speech, only here there is no youth towards which the gesture is directed. In contrast to folio 7v, this portrait has been highlighted with a golden border, bejeweled plinth, and, like the image on folio 12v, a much finer drawing than seen before. Rather than a blank scroll, the text presents foundational knowledge on the causative principle within the universe and thus parallels the illustration of divine creation on the opposite folio. Moreover, the principle of harmony that undergirds the text--that opposites yield opposites--reinforces the folios' allusions to the harmony of God's Creation. By presenting Hippocrates in this fashion, not wearing an historically datable hat and placed within a golden divine-like framework, it is as if Hippocrates has been universalized like the maxim he holds, tantamount to a Jewish prophet whose doctrines prefigured Christ.417 Yet the illustration also has an indexical function similar to the image on folio 7v. The pointed finger indicates that the maxim about the foundational principal of medicine, a principle directly designed by God who created all and then discovered by Hippocrates, could be found in the remaining texts and images that follow. 416 In Hippocrates, Works. English & Greek, trans. W.H.S. Jones (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2014), 154. Note that inanitio et repletio are also one of the six non-naturals, see https://celt.ucc.ie/published/L600009A.html. 417 Honorius Augustodunensis (1080-1151) also describes Hippocrates as a prophet in his work, De anima et de Deo. 174 2.4 Conclusion Despite noting certain images with potential religious implications, scholars have primarily considered Harley 1585 as a practical medical book within the tradition of medical literature. Here I have argued that the manuscript must also be understood within the intellectual and spiritual context of the northern European monastic milieu in which it was likely produced. Using a popular medical miscellany from the early Middle Ages, the compiler inserted and arranged new images and texts in order to apply traditionally available medical theory to surgery and to create a new theological exposition on the nature of the healthy and unhealthy body and soul, the cures offered by medicine and sacrament, and the ultimate source of health and cure in the divine. The manuscript becomes a meditation human suffering and its potentially salvific function and also suggest that these Christian ideas are foreshadowed in the works of the ancient Greek medical author, Hippocrates. The hermeneutic strategies employed are multiple: illustrations that evoke medical, theological, and cosmological ideas of universal harmony, large initials that signal the importance of a text, and the varying elements of mis-en-page that work to produce numerical symbolism and diagrammatic meaning. Harley 1585 might also be seen as a novel instrument for monastic meditatio: one that combines both the traditional monastic techniques of associative reading with literal and practical medical information. 175 Chapter Three The Institutional Body: Preventative Medicine, Cure, and Ideal Health Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Clm 13002 3.1 Introduction In the middle decades of the twelfth century, the monks of St. George Pr\u00fcfening in Bavaria compiled a codex that is a testament to the community's intellectual and spiritual vitality (Munich, BSB, Clm 13002, \"Pr\u00fcfening manuscript\"). The codex has an encyclopedic character, containing images and texts of different type, the largest of which is a glossary. Most important for this study, the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript includes among its variety of materials the earliest surviving images of human anatomy and a series of cautery illustrations that depict famous ancient men acting as healers. These medical images are part of a seven-folio preface of figural illustrations that was added in 1165 to the compilation of texts assembled seven years earlier in 1158.418 The latter consists of an introductory prologue composed by the Pr\u00fcfening scriptorium (fol. 8r); the Glossarium Salomonis, which comprises two alphabetically arranged word lists with definitions drawn from ancient sources (fols. 8v-208v);419 the Hermeneumata Pseudodositheana, essentially a Greek-to-Latin dictionary (fols. 209r-218r); and several biblical commentaries likely composed by members of the Pr\u00fcfening community (218v-229r). The preface of 1165, in addition to the anatomical and cautery images, also includes a full-page illustration of man as a microcosm (the earliest of its kind), two folios of narrative- 418 The earlier date, 1158, is provided in the manuscript on what was the first page of the original work (now folio 8r). The second date is named in the preface on folio 5v. 419 The Glossarium was allegedly compiled by Salomo, Abbot of St. Gall and bishop of Constance (d. 919). J.A. McGeachy, \"The Glossarium Salomonis Speculum 13.3 (1938): 309-318. 176 based illustrations of the virtues and vices, a bird's eye image of Jerusalem, and a treasury inventory illustrated with figures important to the monastic community and its history, followed by a book inventory. Because of the seemingly eclectic nature of its contents, modern scholars have generally regarded the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript as an encyclopedic miscellany or schoolbook. Compared to the more systematic university books of a century later, however, the Pr\u00fcfening book is perceived to be a collection of only marginally related scientific and religious materials lacking a defined pedagogical order. For this reason, the items gathered in the codex have tended to be treated separately, abstracted from their manuscript context, and studied from the perspectives of different specialized disciplines. In the case of the anatomical and cautery images, in particular, scholarly interest has largely come from historians of medicine. There are, however, exceptions. Elisabeth Klemm was one of the first to consider the cycle of illustrations in the preface as a whole with reference to the monastic context that produced them.420 While Klemm still assumed the encyclopedic intent of the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript, for her the images and their arrangement played a role in the monastery's spiritual formation. The first image, the microcosm, she supposes, would have reminded the monastic viewer of the creation of man and the beginning of salvation history. The medical images that follow draw attention to the body and its required physical renewal, while the 420 Elizabeth Klemm, \"Die Klostergemeinschaft Reichert, 1980). 177 vices and virtues signal the moral reform needed for salvation. The map of the earthly Jerusalem heralds its heavenly counterpart and the ultimate end of the monastic journey. The decorated treasury list, the final component of the preface, acts as an institutional mirror that both projects an ideal self-image and provides a model for correction.421 Taken together, according to Klemm, the illustrations form a virtual path for the spiritual progression of both the individual monk and the monastic community. Adam Cohen, in a similar manner, focused on the preface illustrations as tools for monastic meditatio upon broad themes of cosmic, human, and spiritual consequence.422 Neither Klemm nor Cohen, however, addressed the predominance of bodily illustrations in the preface, nor do they specifically examine the function of the medical images within the larger manuscript. A closer consideration of the illustrations of the 1165 preface, the prologue to the original materials of 1158, and the wider context surrounding the making of each part will help provide a clearer explanation of their function. Building on the insights of Klemm and Cohen, I argue that rather than simply being vehicles to convey scientific information, the medical images in the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript functioned as part of the larger whole to establish the nature of the perfect institutional monastic \"body,\" to warn against potential \"pathogens\" in the form of strife and heresy, and to offer a guide for the community's continued \"health\" and, ultimately, its Pr\u00fcfening,\" a Medieval Miscellany,\" Gesta 48.2 (2009): 135-152. 178 3.2. The Illustrations, Manuscript, and Monastery: 1158 and 1165 It is likely that the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript was meant to be a fundamental statement about the community's monastic identity. This is indicated by the spiritual and intellectual nature of its contents, especially the biblical commentaries authored by the monastery itself. It is also reflected in the monumental size of the manuscript\u2014nearly two feet by fifteen inches (56 x 39 cm), comparable in scale to the giant bibles then being fashioned in the twelfth century\u2014as well as the wealth of resources required for its production. Painted arches, multiple columns, and historiated or decorative capitals surround almost all the lexical texts. The fine parchment and elegant script further speak to the value of the manuscript for the monastery and the importance accorded to its intellectual and spiritual agenda. At the time when the 1158 portion was created, the abbey had been in existence for fifty-six years.423 Pr\u00fcfening was founded in 1109 by Otto, the bishop of Bamberg, and staffed by monks from the reformed Swabian monastery of Hirsau, known for its strict observance of the Rule of St. Benedict. Pr\u00fcfening was intended to serve as a model for the Hirsau reform in Bavaria. Indeed, the first abbot, Erminold (1114-1121), was so strict and uncompromising in his adherence to the Rule that he was killed by one of the monks. His successor, Erbo (1121-1162), was able to bring peace and unity to the community while completing the 423 The bishop of Bamberg, Otto, founded the monastery in 1109 on the outskirts of Regensburg and in 1114 brought in monks from Hirsau. Regensburg at that time also contained other highly educated and wealthy monasteries such as St. Emmeram, Pr\u00fcll, Niederm\u00fcnster, and the Schottenkirche of St. James. In the years before the making of the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript, a Pr\u00fcfening monk wrote a Life of Otto and his cult began to form at the monastery. For the history of the monastery, see Andrea Schwarz, Die 179 process of reform.424 Erbo finished the architectural space of the monastery and vastly enlarged its library to meet the monks' intellectual needs.425 During this period Pr\u00fcfening produced several important spiritual writers, including Idung, Boto, and Arnold.426 The manuscript of 1158 was created under Erbo and the period of reform and intellectual vigor. Its prologue opens by naming all the contemporary benefactors of the monastery seen as responsible for its spiritual and economic growth: Pope Hadrian (1154-1159); the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick Barbarossa (1155-1190), who had recently reaffirmed the rights of the monastery; Bishop Eberhard of Bamberg (1146-1170); their beloved Abbot Erbo, who had encouraged the brothers' devotion and studies; the librarian, 424 Erbo came from the Hirsau subsidiary monastery St. Georgen in the Black Forest, a foundation that had become one of the most important centers of the Hirsau reform. Schwarz, Die Traditionen, 69-70. 425 For the link between the eleventh-century monastic reform movement in Germany and the building of monastic libraries, see Rodney Thomson, \"Twelfth-Century Renaissance: Books, Scriptoria and Libraries,\" in Turning over a New Leaf: Change and Development in the Medieval Book, eds. Erik Kwakkel, Rosamond McKitterick and Rodney Thomson, 127-144 (Leiden, Leiden University Press, 2012). For more on the art and architecture of the monastery, see Heidrun Stein, Die romanischen Idung entered the monastery in 1144 but later left for a Cistercian monastery. His works include Argumentum super quatuor questionibus and Dialogus duorum monachorum. Arnold (professed before 1140) wrote Vox de Propiciatorio,\" a dialogue version of Marian tales. Heinrich joined the order around 1150 and focused his works on verse accounts of the miracles occurring at the monastery. Boto, the most well-known writer from the monastery, authored many mystical texts include homilies and commentaries. For more information on these writers see, R.B.C. Huygens, Le Moine Idung Kurt Illing and Pr\u00fcfening's substantial library;427 and finally the illustrious scribe, Swicher, who copied many of the manuscript's texts.428 The prologue reports that in 1158, during the fortieth year of Erbo's reign and at the instigation of Wolfger, the scriptorium undertook and completed the work in short order. This speed, it recounts, required the care and anxiety of many during its production, as well as a unified and harmonious community working together to produce such a work.429 The monks' unity is described using the metaphor of a single body with one spirit, one heart and one soul (intus unus spiritus unum cor una anima colligebat), and a body protected as if a walled city with all its gates closed and guarded (quos tamen una omnes foris arta monasterii these symbols for the monastic community\u2014as a body and as a city with all of its openings protected\u2014would reemerge in the illustrated preface seven years later. In 1165, seven folios of figural illustrations were added at the head of the manuscript. The new section, as originally conceived, opened with a full-page depiction of a harmonious and unified body\u2014a figural microcosm\u2014accompanied by textual inscriptions linking it to ancient cosmological theories (fol. 7v).430 The cautery and anatomical illustrations, whose accompanying texts both likely derived from late antique sources, then followed (fols. 1v- 427 For information on the twelfth-century librarian and treasurer of the monastery, see Heinrich see Elizabeth Sears, \"The Afterlife of Scribes: Swicher's Prayer in the Pr\u00fcfening Isidore,\" in Pen in Hand: Medieval Scribal Portraits, Colophons and Tools, ed.

Immediately after were two illustrations of the virtues and vices, whose stories and inscriptions are largely based on the Bible, primarily the Old Testament (fols. 3v-4r). Next came an image of the walled city of Jerusalem juxtaposed with a visual description by Bede (fol. 4). Finally, there is an illustrated version of the monastery's treasury and book lists that contains depictions of its heavenly patrons and important members from the community's history (fols. 5v-6v). The illustrated preface was created under very different circumstances than the original section. Abbot Erbo died in 1162 and left Pr\u00fcfening in a state of flux with two succeeding abbots in a space of two years.431 Elected in 1162, Abbot Gottfried was brought in by the bishop and served only four months.432 Eberhard, a former monk at Pr\u00fcfening who had taken on the abbacy of Ansbach, was then elected in 1163. In addition to inner turmoil, external events added to the unrest as well. In 1159, a major schism in the Church occurred when two rival popes were elected. Pr\u00fcfening remained loyal to the canonically elected pope, while Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who had been named and honored in the 1158 prologue, favored the antipope and for this was excommunicated.433 Created during this period of instability and ruptures in the Church following its perceived \"golden age\" under the long-reigning Abbot Erbo, the 1165 preface sets forth a 431 Erbo quickly developed a cult following with his relics raised in 1200 by the Archbishop of Mainz. Schwarz, Die Traditionen, 70-71. 432 Gottfried had been a monk at a nearby monastery, St. Emmeram, for only a short time before being elected abbot of Pr\u00fcfening and before joining the monastery, he held the post of provost at the Regensburg cathedral. Elected in November 1162, by January he was in Bamberg for health reasons and died there. Schwarz, Die Traditionen, 70. 433 Maria Elisabeth Regensburg (Regensburg: Schnell & Steiner, 2009), 35. 182 metaphorical institutional plan for the reinvigoration of the monastery. Every image engages with the concept of the body and its perfection (health) or imperfection (disease or death) and many name sources of disease (pathogens) that must be blocked from entering the monastic gates and bodily openings as well as those substances that may enter due to their health-giving properties. In this way, the preface serves as a guide for the well-being of the monastery\u2014as a single unified and harmonious body\u2014and a reminder of its former vigor under the guidance of the beloved Erbo. These ideas are suggested by the formal structures of the illustrations in the preface; the selection and placement of texts; the order of the images; and particular features of the ubiquitous bodies. Like the manuscript, which was meant to be read and viewed consecutively, my analysis will begin with the original opening illustration of an ideal healthy body, the man as microcosm. 3.3 Man as Microcosm (folio 7v, originally folio 1v) In its original ordering, the illustrated preface of 1165 opened with a full-page drawing of a human body, a man represented as a microcosm of the larger universe (fig. 152). Amplified by the substantial size of the manuscript, the nearly full-page height of the microcosmic man not only dominates the folio but also establishes the somatic focus of the entire prefatory section. Inscriptions placed in banderoles and the border are taken from the Elucidarium, an early summa of Christian theology by Honorius Augustodunensis; these further highlight anatomical and physiological aspects of the human body.434 Considered in 434 The inscriptions are taken from imaginem Dei [On the creation of man and how he is a small world and (is created) in the image of God]), PL, 172, col. 1116B. For an edited translation, see Yves Lef\u00e8vre, L'Elucidarium et les Lucidaires: \u00c2ge (Paris: E. de Boccard, 1954). For a discussion of Honorius's views on the microcosm, see Wanda Cizewski, \"The Doctrine of Creation in the First Half of the Twelfth Century: Selected Authors (Rupert of 183 relation to other illustrated microcosms, both past and contemporary, the Pr\u00fcfening example has at least three unique characteristics: Christ-like features, bodily senses that are focused on spiritual rather than natural objects, and a hierarchically organized body with the head taking precedence. Together, the Pr\u00fcfening microcosm is a portrait of the perfect spiritual body, an image intended to be contemplated and realized by the community's body of monks. 3.3a. The Historical Microcosm The theory of the microcosm originated in the ancient world as a scientific explanation of the material creation. It holds that the \"First Man\" was designed as a miniature universe (the macrocosm), made of the same elements and subject to the same rational order and temporality. As a result, knowledge of one lead to knowledge of the other.435 Early Deutz, Honorius Augustodunensis, Peter Abelard, and Hugh of St. Victor),\" Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Toronto, 1983. For more general information on the Elucidarium, see the many articles by Valerie I. J. Flint including Honorius Augustodunensis of Regensburg, Authors of the Middle Ages, Vol. II, Nos. 6 (Aldershot: Variorum, 1995); \"Heinricus of Augsburg and Honorius Person?\" Revue Benedictine 92 (1982): 148-158; and \"The Original Text of the Elucidarium of Augustodunensis from the Twelfth Century English Manuscripts,\" des Etudes Relatives aux Manuscrits 18 (1964): 91-94. For links between Honorius's works and art, see Joseph Anton Endres, Das St. Jakobsportal in si\u00e8cles 1914), 94. more on the microcosmic theory, see Fritz Saxl, \"Macrocosm and Microcosm in Mediaeval Pictures,\" in Lectures, 2 vols.

Christian authors rejected the cosmological implications of the theory\u2014for Christianity had its own creation story in the Old Testament and model for the template of man, made in the likeness of God. But Christians did maintain those aspects of the microcosmic theory that emphasized man's harmonious relationship with the God-created universe. Illustrated examples survive from as early as the ninth century and all make use of textual and diagrammatic features, such as circles and symmetry, to represent the unified and concordant nature of the universe and to show humankind's place within it. Prime examples are the diagrams that often accompanied the works of Isidore of Seville (fig. 153).436 Here the words mundus, annus, and homo (the world, year, and human being) are placed within the center of concentric circles and are surrounded by inscriptions that reference the four elements (ignis, aqua, terra, aer), the four humours (colera, sanguis, humor, melancholia), and the four seasons (sicca, humidus, calidus, frigidus). By the eleventh century, however, the microcosm's meaning and function within the Christian intellectual worldview began to change. In surviving illustrations from this time, the word homo in the diagram becomes Adam, the first man according to the Genesis story (fig. 154).437 This version of the microcosm is more than a scientific explanation about the 436 Munich, BSB, Clm 16128, fol. 16 (ca. 800), in Bianca K\u00fchnel, The End of Time in the Order of Thing: Science and Eschatology in Early Medieval Art (Regensburg: Schnell & Steiner, 2003), fig. 55. 437 Oxford, St. John's College, MS 17, fol. 7v (Thorney Abbey, England). The latter is a complicated diagram linked to Byrhtferth of Ramsey who adapted Bede's text, De temporibus. The illustration focuses on the macrocosm and the harmonious and rational links between time, space, and materiality. In the center of the diagram, he places the letters \"A-D-A-M,\" which both signify the Greek names for the four directions and refer to the first man, Adam. For more on the manuscript and diagram see Faith Wallis, \"2. Computus Related Materials: 20. Byrhtferth's Diagram,\" on the website The Calendar & the Cloister. Oxford, St. John's College, MS 17, https://digital.library.mcgill.ca/ms-17/index.htm. For Byrhtferth see, Cyril Hart, \"Byrhtferth and His Manual,\" Medium Aevum 41 (1972): Singer Diagram,\" Bodleian Quarterly Record 11 (1917): 47-51. The diagram includes the concordance between the four 185 nature of the world but presents a moral model to be imitated. This is prelapsarian Adam, before the advent of sin, the first man as God intended him to be. By contemplating Adam the microcosm in perfect harmony with the macrocosm of God's creation, the Christian might hope to restore the intended harmonious order within his or her soul. These earlier examples, however, are just diagrams; the first figural representations of a human being as the microcosmic man do not appear until the twelfth century. In addition to the example in the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript, there are also figural microcosms (fig. 158).440 The significance of the Pr\u00fcfening microcosm can best be seen by comparing it closely to these contemporary examples. elements, four seasons, four directions, four humours, and the four ages of man as well as the months and the zodiac constellations and is entitled: de concordia mensium atque elementum (concerning the concordance of months and the elements). For another example, see Oxford, Bodleian, MS. Ashmole 328, pg. 85. 438 Wolfenb\u00fcttel, Herzog August Bibliothek, Cod. Guelf. 1 Gud. Lat., fol. 31r (late twelfth century, northern France). This work is a later copy of the Liber floridus, an original work designed and written by Lambert of St. Omer. In the autograph copy (Ghent, University Library, MS 92, ca. 1120), the microcosm is only referenced by an inscription underneath a diagram of the Six Ages of the World (fol. 20v). For the latest examination of the Liber Floridus, see Albert Derolez, The Making and Meaning of the Liber Floridus: A Study of the Original Manuscript Ghent, University Library, MS 92 (Turnhout: Harvey Miller/Brepols, 2015). 439 Lucca, Bibliothek Statale, Ms. 27v (Book I, Vision 3) and fol. 9r (Book I, Vision 2). Hildegard composed the text between 1163 and 1173 but the illustrated copy did not appear until after her death, in the early thirteenth-century and likely in anticipation of her canonization. It is possible that the images are based on copies made by Hildegard and, even if they are not, they largely follow the descriptive text written by Hildegard. Barbara Newman, \"'Sibyl of the Rhine:' Hildegard's Life and Times,\" in Voice of the Living Light: Hildegard of Bingen and Her World, ed. eadem (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1998), 1-29; and Madeline Caviness, \"Artist: 'To See, Hear, and Know All at Once',\" in Ibid., 110-124. For the critical edition see Bingensis Liber divinorum Dronke (Turnholt: Brepols, 1996). 440 This singular manuscript was created by abbess Herrard of Hohenburg for her convent in Alsace. It no longer exists, having been destroyed in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian war. The available images are those based on sketches of nineteenth-century scholars and now reproduced, although incomplete, in a twentieth-century publication, Hortus Deliciarum, ed. Rosalie Green et al. (London: 186 3.3b. Christological Features of the Pr\u00fcfening Microcosm in Relation to Contemporary Models The microcosmic man in the Liber floridus is the second of two diagrams that appear on a folio that is otherwise dominated by text (fig. 155). Lambert, the monastic author, has chosen to depict the microcosm as a naked male youth standing in the center of a circle. His body is not symmetrical, for his left hip juts out as his body twists towards the right. Surrounding him are six roundels labeled with the names of the four elements and only two of the four seasons (winter and summer). No other text is placed inside the illustration to clarify its meaning, yet scholars have surmised that these six roundels\u2014rather than eight as one might expect (to account for the full complement of seasons)\u2014relate to the adjacent text surrounding the image, an historical tract on the Six Ages of Man.441 The microcosmic figure in the Liber floridus is not labeled, but in light of its precedents it is not unreasonable to interpret it as Adam\u2014in this case, however, not prelapsarian Adam, but fallen Adam, Adam out of harmony with creation on account of his sin. Not only is the microcosmic body asymmetrical but the accompanying text on the Six Ages of Man recounts the growth of the body and its decline, a chronology that Augustine had analogized with the Six Ages of the World that began with fallen Adam. In fact, directly above the microcosmic figure there is a The Warburg Institute, 1979). The scholarship on the manuscript is vast, but for the most recent assessments, see Danielle B. Joyner, Painting the \"Hortus deliciarum:\" Medieval Women, Wisdom and Time (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2016); and Fiona Griffiths, The Garden of Delights: Reform and Renaissance for Women in the Twelfth Century (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007). 441 Franz Saxl, \"Illustrated Mediaeval Encyclopedias II: The Christian Transformation,\" in Lectures, (London: Warburg Institute, University of London, 1957), 243-4. Saxl argues that this image relates to Augustine's theory of history instead of the macro/microcosm. Augustine uses the ages of human beings to illustrate the ages of the world in the De Civitate Dei. 187 parallel illustration featuring the world (macrocosm) represented by a bearded man with a twisted body, which seems to make this very connection (fig. 159). There are two similar microcosms in Hildegard of Bingen's Liber divinorum operum (figs. 156-157). Both appear in the first book prefacing the chapters on her visions of God's created works, which include textual references to the macro- and microcosm and the harmonious relations between them.442 Each illustration depicts a highly symmetrical macrocosm and a less than balanced microcosm. In both instances, a youthful microcosmic man appears within a circle and his body twists to the right.443 In one of the images, the macrocosm is supplemented by another figural depiction\u2014Caritas (charity or love), who is drawn in red and embraces the roundel in which the microcosm is placed. No text appears within this illustration, but the chapter for which it acts as a frontispiece concerns God's love for his creation. The other example in Hildegard's Liber divinorum operum highlights human physiology and disease. The asymmetrical microcosm is surrounded by the winds, which, according to the text of the chapter it precedes, directly affect the humours of the body and the health of the individual.444 442 For more on Hildegard's ideas on material creation, see Elisabeth G\u00f6ssmann, \"Hildegard Papers (Toronto: Peregrina, 1998), 17-28. 443 The texts that follow these two images only refer to the microcosm as the imago hominis (image of man), however in Vision 4.97 within the same book, Adam is described as the microcosm--as holding within his body the \"immense instrument of the universe (immensum totius mundi instrumentum).\" 444 In Book 1, Hildegard goes into great detail describing the effects of the winds of the universe on the humours and organs of the body causing either human flourishing or sickness and sin. For more on her theory of disease, see Florence Eliza Glaze, \"Medical Writer: 'Behold the Human Creature',\" in Voice of the Living Light, 125-148. 188 Finally, there is the microcosm appearing in the Hortus deliciarum (fig. 158). This one has the most similarities to that found in the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript. The Hortus microcosm shares the same general structure with the latter, including the four elements in the corners, a male body in the middle with halo-like circle around the head, and inscriptions taken from the Elucidarium. Yet there are clear differences. Like the preceding examples the male at the center is Adam-like, an unbearded youth with a twisted body; the overall form of the illustration is not symmetrical; and the inscriptions are unbounded, appearing to float haphazardly within the illustration. In addition, these inscriptions include sections from the Elucidarium that do not appear in the Pr\u00fcfening example. It is likely that the Pr\u00fcfening scriptorium had access to models similar to these and chose to make changes in order to create its own interpretation and ideal of the microcosmic body. For only a few years after completing the 1165 preface, the monastery produced another rendition of the microcosm with the same youthful face and twisted body found in the examples just described (Vienna, Osterreichische Nationalbibliothek 12600, fol. 29r) (fig. 160). Like that in the Hortus deliciarum, the body of this microcosm is not enclosed within a circle but instead surrounded by the figural depictions of the winds and a text that numerically associates the causal forces of the natural world\u2014the twelve winds, the four elements, and the four directions\u2014with Christian proselytizers\u2014the four evangelists, the twelve apostles, and their successors, the priests, and bishops. This version of the microcosm appears in a computus manuscript concerned with the passage of time and portraying the natural universe as it presently exists. Returning to the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript of 1165, we find a microcosm conceived with a different purpose in mind than that of the computus and its models. The author has changed certain elements and added features that resonate with other aspects of the manuscript, 189 especially the 1165 preface, thus integrating the microcosm into a larger web of relationships and meanings. While the previous microcosmic men described are youthful and asymmetrical and likely allude to Adam, the first man fallen into disharmony with the macrocosm on account of his sin, the Pr\u00fcfening image depicts a figure with obvious Christ-like characteristics. The man is older and bearded with longer hair and a halo-like circle encompassing his head. The placement of the four elements in the corner suggests a quasi-divine space, mimicking illustrations of the four evangelists surrounding Christ in Majesty (fig. 161).445 The face also closely resembles that of the Christ appearing later in the Pr\u00fcfening preface who stands behind the top of the treasury inventory (fig. 162). Finally, the man's bodily symmetry reflects humankind restored to its original harmony with creation, a possibility now realized through Christ's Resurrection. Seen against the background of the microcosmic tradition, the image is a pictorial representation of a trope common to Christian theology: Christ as a new or second Adam come to overturn the sin of the first Adam, which has its basis in the scriptural writings of St. Paul (see Rom 5:15-21; 1 Cor 15:22). Moreover, this theological blending also had precedents in visual form. The Pr\u00fcfening scriptorium itself produced illustrations that commingle Adam and Christ (fig. 163).446 445 Maiestas Domini from the Codex Aureus Regensburg, Munich, BSB, Clm 14000, fol. 6v (870, donated to St. Emmeram ca. 900). 446 See, for example, an anonymous treatise on the Cross, Munich, BSB, Clm 14159, fol. 14r (1170-80, Regensburg). Christ and the arma Christi are placed above a diagrammatic depiction of paradise. The Lamb of God and the inscription \"A-D-A-M\" lie at the center of paradise. See also Munich, BSB, Clm 13031 (Etymologiae, Isidore of Seville). Both contain illustrations that visually blend the images of Adam and Christ. Cohen, \"Making Memories,\" 144. 190 3.3c. Relationship to the Macrocosm and Hierarchies of the Body The earliest diagrams of the macro- and microcosm singled out correspondences between the human body and the universe in order to demonstrate the cosmic harmony of God's creation. In general, the associations were based on patterns of \"fours\" (the four humours, the four elements, the four seasons)\u2014a number symbolic in ancient thought about the natural (as opposed to the celestial) world. The diagrams made these connections through the placement of text and by lines linking them together. With the figural microcosms of the twelfth century, however, the relationships rendered between the micro- and the macro become more complex, with only minor references to numerical similarities. In the Pr\u00fcfening example, it is the anatomical and physiological features of the microcosmic man, rather than the humours, that are linked to the elements and celestial spheres that comprise the macrocosm. To begin with, while the figure indeed has Christ-like features, the halo that surrounds his head does not contain the cross that is the normal iconographic identifier of Christ. Rather, the author created the halo using concentric circles and radiating lines that form banderoles containing inscriptions. The text within the banderoles analogizes the shape of the figure's head to the larger celestial sphere (instar celestis spere), while the radiating lines directly connect the seven sensorial openings of the man's head with the seven planets that were recognized in the Middle Ages. The eyes are connected to the sun (sol) and moon (luna); the ears to Jupiter (iupiter) and Mercury (mercurius); the nostrils to Mars (mars) and Venus (venus); and the mouth to Saturn (saturnus). Such a depiction appears to be novel to the Pr\u00fcfening microcosm but the idea of a relationship between the sensorial openings (foramina) and the \"seven harmonies of harmoniae) can be found in the Eluciadarum, the source for most of the 191 image's inscriptions, although this particular passage does not appear on the page.447 Moreover, while four was a number representative of the natural world, seven had both celestial (seven planets) and spiritual connotations (seven days of creation). Yet the Pr\u00fcfening microcosm is not just linked to the heavenly spheres. The body and its parts are connected to the physical world as well. Diagonal banderoles with inscriptions link the same senses to the roundels in the corners containing the elements. Thus, sight is said to be from fire (ex igne visum); hearing from the higher air (ex aere superiori auditum); smell from the lower air (ex inferiori olfactum), touch from the earth (ex terra tactum), and taste from the water (ex aqua gustum). The hexameters within the outside border reiterate and expand the agency of the elements in the generation of physiological abilities and processes. The inscription begins on the left with a small cross reminding the viewer that this agency is part of God's plan. Fire gives [humans] heat, sight, and mobility (ignis fervorem visum dat mobilitatem) and air gives them the ability to breathe, speak, hear, and smell (aer huic donat quod flat sonat audit odorat). The bottom half of the border includes inscriptions related to water\u2014from water, the gift of taste as well as use of the sanguine humour (munus aqua gustus humor tum sanguinis usus); and earth\u2014from which man derives his flesh, sense of touch, and weight (ex terra carnem tactum trahit et gravitatem). 447 The inscriptions, as mentioned above, are not original to the Pr\u00fcfening microcosm; almost all are taken from the Elucidarium and attributed to Honorius Augustodunensis (ca. 1080-1141). This Pr\u00fcfening shares this with the microcosm found in the Hortus deliciarum. According to the Elucidarium, human beings are created from both spiritual (spirituali) and corporeal (corporali) substances. Both Pr\u00fcfening and the Hortus include inscriptions that relate to the corporeal body of the microcosm. Unlike the Hortus, however, Pr\u00fcfening does not include any abstracts from the Elucidarium related to the invisible, spiritual aspects of the body, which, according to the text, were not created through the intermediary of the elements but directly by God himself. Note also that Saxl, \"Macrocosm and Microcosm in Mediaeval Pictures,\" 64, attributes the link between the sensory openings and the planets to an ancient Persian myth that was developed by the Greeks, so it is possible that there were early illustrations of this material. 192 The banderoles and inscriptions also link the elements to the body's organs and other aspects of human physiology. The chest (pectus), the site of breath and coughing, is related to air with its wind and thunder (in quo flatus et tussis ut in aere venti et tonitrua); the stomach to water, similar to how the rivers flow into the sea (venter mare, in quo confluunt omnia ut in mare flumina); the feet correspond to the earth, for just as they bear the mass of the body so too does the earth sustain all (ut pedes molem corporis terra sustenat omnia). In addition, the bones are linked to stones (os lapides) and the fingernails to trees (ungves arbore). One other aspect of the microcosmic body is worth noting. While the texts within the banderoles link the microcosmic body to the elements and macrocosm, the visual effect of the lines that cut through the body, the circle at the top, and the use of colour on the page create a four-part hierarchy of the body with emphasis on the head.448 The head is the only area defined by a circle, a geometrical shape considered in ancient and medieval thought to be perfect. In addition, it is the only area on the body with text in red ink, used to name the planets representing spiritual objects.449 The second and third areas, the chest and lower belly regions, are separated by a single line just underneath the word pectus (chest)--the only one 448 The medical literature of the period is divided as to which of the bodily regions takes precedence: the head or the heart. The Pr\u00fcfening microcosm chooses the head. For a summary of the relative positions, see Alcuin Blamires, \"Paradox in the Medieval Gender Doctrine of Head and Body,\" in Medieval Theology and the Natural Body, ed. Peter Biller and A.J. Minnis (Rochester, NY: York Medieval Press, 1997), 13-30. 449 Red is also used for the title, Microcosmos, and for the elements fire and air. It is likely that the element of fire is highlighted due to its connection with sight and the suggestion in the Elucidarium that the soul is made by God using spiritual fire. Air and hearing, linked to hearing the Word of God is, by the twelfth century, generally considered second in importance. For more on the hierarchies of the senses, body regions, and the elements, see Richard Newhauser, \"The Senses, the Medieval Sensorium, and Sensing (in) the Middle Ages,\" in Handbook of Medieval Culture: Fundamental Aspects and Conditions of the European Middle Ages, vol. 3, ed. Albrecht Claussen (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2015), 1559-1575; and Blamires, \"Paradox in the Medieval Gender Doctrine.\" 193 on the illustration that does not form a banderole for text.450 These two areas also include banderoles with text and cover areas of the body. The chest region is linked to the element aer (air) and described both as an area for life-giving breath and also coughing (in quo flatus et tussis). Below, in the lower belly (venter), the texts identify the area with water (mare, or the sea). Finally, the lowest part is defined by the feet, unusual in that contemporary medical literature typically centered this fourth region of the body in the groin.451 In Pr\u00fcfening, however, the genitals are unmentioned and partially hidden by two textual banderoles. As an inscription states, the feet play a supportive role for the body, ut pedes molem corporis terra sustentat omnia (just as the feet support the mass of the body, the earth sustains all). While in the three other areas of the body the descriptive text is placed within a banderole, here it only partially appears within lines. The beginning reference to the microcosmic body \"ut pedes molem corporis\" is un-bordered, uneven, and interweaves through the decorative plants and feet of the microcosm. Though the text highlights the important function of this region of the body, these visual details suggest their lesser status. Finally, the connection of the four bodily 450 This line does not appear in the Hortus deliciarum illustration where the only lines surround the head of the microcosm, but a similar one is found in the two images in Hildegard's work. In both of her illustrations, a line goes directly across the center of the circle intersecting the body of the microcosm at his genitals. The related text in the Liber divinorum operum, Part 1, Vision 2, ch. 11, describes the line as running from East to West and as severing the North, home of the devil, from the other zones. Presumably, then, the illustration depicts north at the bottom of the illustration--from the genitals downward. While this is not a usual position for north in medieval maps, images in Hildegard's other work, Scivias, Eibingen, Abbey St. Hildegard, Cod. 1, (\"Eibingen Scivias\"), also portray north at the bottom of the page. See for example, the image associated with Part 1, Vision 2, of the falling angels in which north is at the bottom. The Eibingen Scivias is a handmade copy of the original twelfth-century manuscript, Wiesbaden, Hessische Landesbibliothek, Hs 1, made between 1927 and 1933. The original manuscript was produced in the Rupertsberg scriptorium around 1165 and was lost in 1945. 451 For example, Galen names four centers of life in the body: the brain in the head, the heart in the chest, the liver in the belly, and the testicles in the lower region of the body. Danielle Jacquart, \"Coeur ou cerveau? Les h\u00e9sitations m\u00e9di\u00e9vales Turisanus,\" Micrologus 11 (2003): 73-95, 74. An eleventh-century illustration of these four central regions appears in Cambridge, Caius and Gonville College, MS 428/428, fol. 50. 194 regions\u2014head, chest, belly, and feet\u2014with fire, air, water, and earth respectively, reflects the hierarchical valuing of the elements that was common in the ancient world. The theme of the hierarchical body with its emphasis on the head will reemerge in the succeeding images in the preface. 3.4. Cautery Procedures (folios 1v-2v, originally folios 2v-3v) After the monumental image of a full-page microcosmic man there follow two and a half folios of cautery procedures (Tables 5-7, figs. 164-166).452 While the microcosm represented a perfect spiritual body, Christ-like in nature and impervious to illness, the cautery procedures, by contrast, depict \"fleshly bodies\"\u2014sinful, imperfect, fallen bodies, bearing disease, and requiring a cure. Taken at face value, the illustrated cautery procedures convey a method for bodily healing based on current medical science. The inscriptions contain more information on the surgeries themselves and all contain surgeons employing multiple types of healing instruments. Yet there are other, more figurative ways in which these images resonate with the deeper significance of the 1165 preface. Their formal arrangement contributes to an expanded conception of what constitutes a \"body,\" and the texts and depictions suggest that there are other sources of \"cure\" besides what we today consider properly medical. 452 See Appendix E for a transcription and translation of the inscriptions related to the cautery procedures. 195 Table 5: Partial Text453 and Translation of Nine Cautery Images (3 x 3) on Folio 1v (fig. 164) Head: epilenticus (caducus) ( a patient with medicus (Doctor Filomus) Head: (Aristotle was expert in music and geometry.

Images and Text: Curious Healers and Cures Each of the twenty-two cautery images on fols. 1v-2v depicts a healer applying a cure to a diseased patient. All but three of the healers are identified with ancient authorities, the earliest example of illustrated cautery procedures to do so.454 Yet in only seven cases is 454 Other later manuscripts that include multiple named doctors performing surgery include the copy of Pr\u00fcfening made at Scheyern Abbey, Munich, BSB, Clm 17403 (thirteenth century); Oxford, Bodleian, MS. e Mus. 19 (late thirteenth century, Italy); and Venice, Biblioteca Marcianus, VII.13 197 this authority explicitly based on medical expertise. Filomus, Dyocles, and Zenophon are labeled as medicus; Themison, Erasistratus, and Demetrius are described as having written books on bodily disease; and Galen (identified only by the letter \"G\") is described as having invented the art of medicine. Galen, however, is also called a philosopher and said to have invented the arts of astronomy, music, geometry, and arithmetic.455 Of the remaining doctors, eight are identified not by their medical credentials but as \"emperors\" (imperator), a title emphasized by the appearance of crowns on their heads. In addition, there is Aristotle who is solely described as an expert in music and geometry.456 The rationale behind this list of healers is not entirely clear, but the identity of some suggests that certain actions or forms of knowledge other than medicine can also provide cures.457 (3090) (14th century, Italy). Only Scheyern matches Pr\u00fcfening's inscriptions. A few scholars have attempted to find the original text from which Pr\u00fcfening's attributions were derived. Sudhoff claims the attributions stem from the medical works of the Roman physician, Caelius Aurelianus (likely fifth century, though this is disputed), and insists that the illustrations and texts were modeled after a Late Antique original. Ein Beitr\u00e4ge zur Geschichte 97-8. This may, indeed, be correct, although no such model exists; a few of the authors depicted in the Pr\u00fcfening illustrations are not named in Caelius's work; and none are attributed with the same cautery procedures found in Pr\u00fcfening. See Caelius in Caelius Aurelianus: On Acute Diseases and On Chronic Diseases, ed. and trans. I.E. Drabkin (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1950). Caelius's work is not listed on either of the twelfth-century Pr\u00fcfening library inventories. For It is possible that the artists and scribes have mistaken, for example, the physician Alexander of Tralles for the Emperor Alexander, and the physician Benedictus Crispus for the emperor Crispus. Yet, others such as Paramenides or Milesius (Thales of Miletus?) do not have imperial \"doubles.\" Another possibility is that the reference to emperors would have reminded the monks of their present emperor, Barbarossa, who is specifically honored in the 1158 prologue. By 1165, the monastery was at odds with Barbarossa over his support of the Antipope Paschal III (1164-1168). This reference may allude their present emperor's power to heal Christendom by supporting the true Pope, Alexander III (1159-1181). Note that the Scheyern manuscript, a copy of Pr\u00fcfening, adds illustrations 198 In addition, the illustrations themselves suggest an expanded idea of cure. This is implied in the ways that certain doctors in the cautery images offer their cure. In most cases, as we would expect, the doctors apply a cautery iron to the affected area of the patient. But in only three instances is the iron seen directly touching a burn spot. Fourteen times, the iron is close but not precisely on the spot. In other cases, instead of an iron the doctor is only shown with a pointed finger or with a raised hand, which often indicates an act of speech (figs. 167-168).458 It is possible that in these cases the doctor acts as philosopher offering through his words a spiritual remedy for a deeper malady that eludes the physical touch of the iron. Finally, in one exceptional case, there is both a cautery iron and a pointed finger, but no mark or cure at all.459 This patient for rheumy gums, the same one set apart for mocking monastic discipline in Durham and for immorality in Harley 1585, is shown refusing treatment as well as physical and mental cure. 3.4b Formal Aspects and Bodily Hierarchy Formal aspects of the cautery images link them as a whole to the preceding image of the microcosmic body. While none of the individual cautery patients are portrayed with the same rigid symmetry or fully frontal view as the microcosmic man, they are arranged into an of music, geometry, and the Virgin Mary to their preface. Perhaps the Scheyern monks also considered these to be healers and offer healing cures. 458 These two illnesses, for dysentery and a disease of the male genitals, likely relate to immorality. In the latter procedure, the patient vulgarly exposes his testicles. The cure of the former requires burns in the shape of the cross (in modum crucis). They will be discussed in more detail below. 459 The one uncured patient suffers from gum disease (ad reuma gingiuarum) and in the image appears with a swollen jaw. This disease occurs in both Harley 1585 and Hunter 100. In Hunter 100, the focus of chapter 2, the patient represented those who mocked the monastic way of life and was thus isolated on a separate folio. In chapter 2, I linked the gum patient in Harley 1585 to Stephaton, the unredeemed Roman soldier who tortured the crucified Christ. 199 orderly symmetrical grid with bounding lines that separate each scene. Moreover, the arrangement and division of these scenes parallels the way that the microcosmic man was divided at the chest to establish a hierarchy of physiological functions. The first two pages of cautery images, each containing nine scenes arranged into a three-by-three grid, face one another on folios 1v and 2r. They are neatly divided into illnesses that occur above the chest, on the left, and those below the chest, on the right. Additionally, as in the microcosm, the chest itself is depicted as a locus of transition within the bodily hierarchy. In the microcosmic man, the chest is identified as both the site of breath (flatus) and coughing (tussis). A similar duality is found in the division of the two cautery tables. The final cautery scene on folio 1v depicts a cure for a type of lung disease (empicus) characterized by the spitting out of deadly poison (qui venenum spuit). Folio 2r also begins with a lung disease (anhelitum et dipsniam), but one typified by lack of breath.460 The duality of these two procedures is reinforced by the identification of the same doctor (Emperor Milesius) as healer in both cases. 3.4c. Outlier Diseases and the Moral Monastic Body Folio 2v contains the final four cautery scenes, arranged on one line and set directly above the first images of anatomical men (fig. 169). The procedures that they depict do not fit into the upper/lower schema of the preceding two pages. Rather they portray bodily ailments and cures that have been isolated from the others. There is no explanation for why this is so, but it does suggest that there are certain aspects of the body that must be treated separately and carefully managed because of the moral danger they pose. 460 Qui patitur anhelitum et dipsiam (id est defectio anhelitus)... (he who suffers from difficult breathing and emphysema, that is a lack of the breath...). 200 The first box concerns cardiacus, or a person who suffers from a disease of the heart (fig. 170). \"Purity of heart\" was one of the central spiritual goals in the monastic tradition, being required for divine union or the beatific vision. The heart was also associated with love (caritas), which is the first virtue named among the virtues and the vices in the pages of the manuscript that follow the anatomical men. The first box also concerns a wound to the stomach (vulnus in stomacho) on the same patient. This has evocations of the wound Christ received to his side while on the Cross, which in the Christian exegetical tradition was understood, among other meanings, as a sign of God's love for man. In the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript, this was considered so serious an ailment that its healing required a cautery burn in the shape of a cross (ad modum crucis). The second box depicts the treatment for a hernia (yrnia) (fig. 168). In the Middle Ages, hernias were often associated with deviant sexuality, and the patient in this case is shown with his genitals visible. The subject of the third box is elefantiosus, or a person who suffers from an enlargement of the limbs and other parts of the body that renders him \"beastlike\" (fig. 171).461 Finally, the fourth box is concerned with podagra, gout of the feet, 461 Elefantiosus is a problematic disease to decipher. Some scholars argue that it represents a form of leprosy and others the disease we know today as elephantiasis. In Pr\u00fcfening's Glossarium, the disease taken from Isidore's Etymologies, IV, 8 (as noted in the margin). It clearly states the similarities between the symptoms of the disease and the nomen (the disease elephantiacus is named for the similarities to an elephant, whose naturally hard and rough skin gives the name of the disease in humans, because it makes the surface of the body like the skin of elephants or because the suffering is massive like the animal from whom it derives its name).\" For more on the disease, its link to the elephant, and its other relationship to cognitive difficulties, see E.J. Christie, \"The Idea of an Elephant: Aelfric of England,\" Neophilologus 98 (2014): 465-479. For more on leprosy in the Middle Ages, see Carole Rawcliffe, Leprosy in Medieval England (Woodbridge, Suffolk and Rochester, NY: Boydell Press, 2006). 201 which was thought to be connected with the excessive eating of meat and rich foods, both of which were forbidden in reformed monasteries (fig. 172). In addition, the pain from the disease would not allow the feet to maintain the support of the body, a characteristic deemed important in the microcosm. In the Pr\u00fcfening depiction, the patient sits and vulgarly raises his tunic above his knees\u2014an unnecessary act, for the cautery marks appear on his calves and ankles. Seen in the larger context of the 1165 preface, these four outlier cautery procedures epitomize diseases associated with the basest aspects of the individual body. They also represent those moral qualities\u2014impurity of heart, lack of charity, sexual deviance, and gormandizing\u2014that within the institutional body must be excluded if the monastery was to achieve its desired spiritual perfection. 3.5. Anatomical Men (folios 2v-3r, originally 3v-4r) That the four cautery scenes excluded from the above/below schema of the preceding two pages have moral implications and figurative associations with the ideal monastic body is reinforced when viewed with reference to the anatomical men directly below (fig. 169). These illustrations, the earliest surviving of their type, depict separately five internal systems of the body: the circulatory system, shown by separate vein and artery figures (both on fol. 2v), and the systems of bones, nerves, and muscles (fol. 3r).462 462 Karl Sudhoff was the first scholar to focus on the anatomical images in the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript, calling them the \"Five-Figure Series\" or the F\u00fcnfbildersie. for Geschichte der Anatomie, 5-10. Following Sudhoff's investigation, additional manuscripts were discovered that contained the series, including copies created in East Asia and the Islamic world. See for example, Luigi MacKinney and Boyd H. Roncioni 202 3.5a. Visual Indications of the Fallen Body Undoubtedly the anatomical men in the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript conveyed knowledge that was useful for the practice of medicine. But there is also evidence to suggest that the larger purpose for their inclusion was to serve as a counterpoint to the microcosmic man and thus contribute to the construction of an ideal of the perfected monastic body. To begin with, while the prologue to the accompanying text names nine illustrations that were to follow, the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript only has five.463 The four that are excluded, all of which appear in N.99) della Biblioteca Universitaria di E.V. Cowdry, \"A Comparison of the Ancient Chinese Anatomical Charts with the 'F\u00fcnfbilderserie' of Sudoff,\" The Anatomical Record 22 (1922): 1-25. 463 The prologue begins just above the head of the first anatomical man (the relevant parts are in bold). \"In (In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Here begins an account of [surgical] cutting as the most experienced of doctors, G[alen] says, vein following vein, bone following bone, muscle following muscle, and nerve following nerve. He describes them according to what they are and separates one from the other so that the viewer might not err, but instead recognize them as he sees them. First is a description of the arteries; second, the veins; third, the position of the bones; fourth, the nerves; fifth, the muscles; sixth, the genitals; seventh, the stomach, liver and belly; eighth, of the womb; ninth, of the brain and eye.)\" The issue of whether the anatomical illustrative series traditionally only included the five bodily figures or nine is one of the most disputed in the academic literature. Some scholars have suggested that the five-series had an independent transmission history beginning in Late Antiquity while others insist that the split occurred later. Because the Pr\u00fcfening illustrations are the earliest surviving copies, it is difficult to determine whether or not they had access to the other four illustrations. The most recent and thorough account of the controversy is found in Taylor Jane McCall, \"Illuminating the Interior: The Illustrations of the Nine Systems of the Body and Anatomical Knowledge in Medieval Europe,\" Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Cambridge, 2017, 37-44, and I agree with her pragmatic conclusion. McCall suggests that a copy of the nine-series was made available via Italy to both Pr\u00fcfening and another monastery in England (now Gonville and Caius) who copied the full series only a few years after. Yet, even if the Pr\u00fcfening monks did not have access to the nine-series, they still chose to include the, now-defective, five as a comparison to the microcosm. 203 another late twelfth-century manuscript\u2014Cambridge, Gonville and Caius College, MS 190/223, fols. organs or isolated systems: the male genitals (fig. 173); the digestive tract (fig. 174); the womb (fig. 175); the brain and the eyes (fig. 176).464 The five images that the Pr\u00fcfening monks chose to include are all depictions of full bodies. In some respects, the five anatomical bodies are similar to that of the microcosm: all are naked, depicted in full-frontal view, and externally symmetrical.465 Their significance, however, is to be found in the differences\u2014the grouping of five rather than one per folio, the disorderly and contrasting elements on the page, and especially the awkward, inelegant deep squatting position of the figures. In this they are reminiscent of the Adam-like microcosms of whose off-balance poses, as we saw, suggested the condition of sinful man after the Fall.466 Previous interpretations of the 464 MS Ashmole 399, from the thirteenth century, also includes the series of nine, however they are not in the order named in the prologue. The other extant manuscript that contains the nine figures is London, Wellcome Library, MS 49 (c.1420-30, Germany). Manuscript fragments indicate that other copies once existed. In addition to Pr\u00fcfening and Scheyern, other examples of manuscripts that only depict the five-series include Oxford, Bodleian, MS. e Mus. 19 (c. 1300, Italy, missing one anatomical man, also includes cautery procedures with famous doctors); Nelahozeves Castle, Roudnice Lobkowicz Library MS VI Fc 29 (late fourteenth century, Bohemia?); Milan, Trivulziana Library, MS 836 (late thirteenth century, Italy, does not include the Historia incisionis text). For a complete list and categorization of the five-figure series, see McCall, \"Illuminating the Interior,\" 7-8. 465 The first anatomical (vein) man appears to hover just above the border as does one foot of the second anatomical (artery) man. The other foot of the artery man is cut in half by the border. The artistic decision to cut his foot does not happen above in the cautery images where doctors or patients' feet regularly cross the border. In the cautery images, the border acts as a ground line, however the line under the anatomical men does not. No border, in fact, appears on the second folio of anatomical images. 466 Also note that the perfect circle that surrounds the bodies in the Liber floridus and the Liber divinorum, and the head of the Christ-like microcosm in Pr\u00fcfening, appears in two, lower parts of the bodies of the anatomical men. Concentric circles, usually identified as the diaphragm, appear in the upper chest region in the depiction of the Vein Man and in the lower belly and groin area of the Muscle Man. In the Gonville and Caius manuscript, an inscription within the larger circles likens the muscle to a mill and describes its function to help other muscles: lacertus similis molendino 204 squatting position have focused on potential models, ranging from ancient fertility goddesses to Islamic medical sources to the actual position of a body on a dissection table.467 While the Pr\u00fcfening anatomical men are indeed likely based on a model, probably one of ancient origin, it is important to consider that the depiction of the deep squatting pose was still a choice. Not all western anatomical men are portrayed in this way. The squat of the figures in the Gonville and Caius manuscript is much less pronounced (figs. 177-181), while the men in a thirteenth-century codex (Oxford, Bodleian, MS. Ashmole 399) barely squat at all (fig. 182).468 Moreover, in both cases each anatomical figure is given an entire folio similar to the microcosm in Pr\u00fcfening. The Pr\u00fcfening anatomical men, it seems, are depicted in such a manner so as to contrast with the unity of the microcosmic man and to draw attention to the divided humanity following the Fall.469 This is reinforced by their placement directly below the four cautery scenes that depict illnesses associated with moral corruption\u2014indeed the circumdans sacrum multa iuuvat (a muscle similar to a mill encircles the sacrum and helps many muscles). In Pr\u00fcfening, the lower half of the Muscle Man does not contain inscriptions. There is no writing at all on the Muscle Man in Scheyern. 467 For discussions of scholarly interpretations, see McCall, \"Illuminating the Interior,\" 37-42; and Boyd H. Hill Jr. \"The F\u00fcnfbilderserie and Medieval Anatomy,\" Ph.D. dissertation, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 1963. It should be noted that no contemporary or later illustration of medically dissected bodies that I have been able to find appears in a squatting position. See for example, Oxford, Bodleian, MS. 399, fol. 34r (third quarter, thirteenth century), which contains what is thought to be the earliest surviving depiction of human dissection. 468 The association with the carnal worldly body may also apply to the anatomical illustrations in MS Ashmole 399. Instead of the anatomical text, which appears on a facing page, the text surrounding the bodies of the anatomical men comes from De coitu (On Sex) translated by Constantine the African. Further research would be necessary to confirm this link. For a translation of the text, see Paul Delany, \"Constantinus Africanus' De coitu: A Translation,\" Chaucer Review 4 (1969): 55-65. 469 Other examples of this bodily position have been linked to base desires. The column capitals within the monastic cloister at St. Michel de Cuxa show a youthful man in an even deeper squatting position than that which appears in the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript. Thomas Dale, \"Monster, Corporeal Deformities, and Phantasms in Cloister of St-Michel-de-Cuxa,\" The Art Bulletin 83.3 (2001): 402-436, has convincingly argued that these sculptural depictions represent the sinful bodily desires that beleaguer all monks pursuing the path to perfection. 205 squatting position of the anatomical bodies appears to mimic the wide-open, bent legs of the hernia patient who is among their number. 3.5b. Textual Guidance for the Ideal Monastic Body The anatomical men in the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript are bounded by text. In fact, it is the text that supplies some visual order to the pages, creating columns and rectangles where no bounding lines appear. The words rather than the bodies dominate the page, surrounding the anatomical figures and even running through their interiors. It is an inverse of the relationship between text, form, and image as found on the folio of the microcosmic man where the body dictates the mis-en-page and the text is fully bounded by the formal structure of lines. The anatomical illustrations are accompanied by two texts.470 The first, which was likely attached to the model for the images, is falsely attributed to Galen and, based on its opening words, is referred to as the Historia incisionis.471 The Historia includes a prologue and a description of what were considered to be the five functional and unifying systems 470 See Appendices F and G for complete transcriptions and translations. 471 At least one of the anatomical descriptions, the Bone text, is believed to be based on Galen's, The Concordance of Hippocrates and Plato, but no available. Ynez Viol\u00e9 O'Neill, \"The F\u00fcnfbilderserie of the Medicine 43.3 (1969): 236-245, 242. Constantine the African's biographers state that he translated the Concordance in the late eleventh century and Gerard of Cremona translated a commentary on the work in Spain at roughly the same time as the creation of the Pr\u00fcfening frontispiece. Monica Green, \"Gloriosissimus Galienus: Galen Eleventh- and Twelfth-Century Latin West,\" in Brill's Companion to the Barbara 326, fn. 15. The Pantegni, also translated by Constantine and available in the West during the twelfth century, contains two chapters on anatomy but there are no associated images. George W. Corner, Anatomical Texts of the Earlier Middle Ages, revised ed. (New York, AMS Press, 1977) 14-15. For a French translation of the anatomical sections of the Pantegni from the original Arabic manuscript, see Trois Trait\u00e9s d'Anatomie Arabes, translated by P. de Kooning (Leyden: Brill, 1903). 206 within the body: circulatory (veins and arteries, considered separately), skeletal, muscular, and nervous. The second accompanying text is anonymous and offers monthly recommendations for different medicinal herbs that should be consumed in order to sustain and protect the body and its systems. Both of these texts would have served a useful medical function. Yet both also convey themes that go beyond observable science, relating the bodily systems to God and emphasizing their nurturing, protective, and unifying purpose. The first key theme that emerges concerns the divine origin of the internal parts of the body. The Historia incisionis mentions God four times. The prologue begins with an appeal to the Trinity. The section on the nervous system speaks of the Lord establishing and fashioning with wisdom all that is within the body (qui in corpore sunt condidit et plasmauit ea sapientissimus dominus). The text on the muscular system states that God made the muscles to both fill the void and join together what was separate.472 Finally, while the section on the skeletal system avoids the terms Deus or Dominus, it does name a faber (maker) and plasmator (fashioner or creator) who separated the bones and re-bound them together using nerves.473 A second theme is the nourishing, protective aspects of the bodily systems. One circulatory system text emphasizes the role of the veins as carrying life-giving liquids that nourish the body, especially the brain.474 The blood is likened to both water that irrigates 472 Haec est separatum est (This is the story of the muscles, which the Lord made in order that the void be filled up and what is separate is joined together). 473 Haec (this is an account of the bones separated one from the other as their maker and creator arranged them; the nerves and the flesh cover them, and the nerves bind one to the another). 474 There is some confusion over whether the text describes what we today would call arteries, that is the vessels that carry oxygenated blood throughout the body, or the veins, which carry waste. While 207 (irrigat) body parts and is required by all living things for their vitality, as well as milk (lacta) with its nurturing, sustaining role.475 With the arteries, the focus is on their protective function, particularly for the brain.476 The protective function is primary for the bones of the the text names the arteries as its topic of discussion, it then goes on to define them as \"veins that do not pulsate.\" The veins, likewise, are called \"veins that pulsate.\" For more on this confusion, see Hill, \"The F\u00fcnfbilderserie and Medieval et in et in cerebrum et est una ex nutricibus apparent hic et nutriunt cerebrum (Thus in the first description the arteries [veins] are considered, which come through the veins of the liver [divided] into two parts, which ascend to the diaphragm and come to the chest and ascend from the chest to the neck. [This is] an account of the arteries that do not pulsate. One of them is poured out into the vertebrae of the neck and thence is led to the face, until it reaches the right temple where it is collected and waters [the right temple] just as its colleague waters the left. The corresponding stream flows through the neck into the chin and comes into the \"gargaleon,\" the head, and the brain and is one of a nourishing blood supply. And from it proceeds a branch which appears on the outside of the throat; it goes back to nourish [offer milk to] the brain. Another vein of the liver encircles the top of the shoulder. From it proceeds another large vein, which descends to the heart and all the way to the left side of the [diaphragm] and equally takes care of both the left and the right sides. In the same way, another branch proceeds from that vein, where it emerges from the liver, and it goes in parts of the liver and the stomach and joins with its partner above the intestine all the way downward and meets up with the hip veins; from there it reaches the sole of the foot and thus throughout the whole structure of the foot and thus through the whole structure of the foot by which they nourish the brain they appear here and nourish the brain [my emphases]). et apparent in facie et colligantur ex omni parte utrumque (And from there proceeds a large vein, which divides in two parts, the right and the left, and from that very vein proceed throughout the body all the veins which pulsate. And again, from there go out two large veins, which ascend to the throat and reach the throat and the palate and appear in the face and are joined from every part above each temple and through all the forehead, and again they ascend to the brain and intertwine themselves over it like a net; this net, which protects and guides the brain, is called anaphusa.) 208 skeletal system.477 Again, the focus for protection is on the head, with the cheek bone (genua) and jaw bone (mandibule) being described as shields (scuta).478 A third major theme is the unitive role of the bodily systems. This is especially emphasized with the nerves, which not only serve as bands connecting the various parts of the body but also as coordinators of sensory information, such as light to the eyes.479 The muscles, for their part, fill up the void that would otherwise exist between the systems, thus joining all into a complete whole.480 The origin of the muscles is said to be in the jaws, which rotunda sub qua cerebrum habitat (These are accounts of bones separated from one another as their maker and creator arranged them; the nerves and the flesh cover them, and the nerves bind one to the another. The beginning of these bones is the helmet: it is rounded in shape and the brain rests under it.) 478 Genae cum jaws and their borders join the root bone of the ears and are called shields). 479 Haec est historia nervorum et est perforatus (This is the account of the nerves, which are the connecting bands of the body, the bones, the veins, and the muscles, and they are in the body as the Lord most wisely formed and fashioned them. At the start two large nerves go through the marrow of the vertebrae, which are to the rear, and they envelop those with their colleague and bind them together and hold them, [until?] they reach the nape of the neck; and from there the tops of those nerves from each side ascend over the head and are collected there in two round [nodes]; one nerve proceeds from the brain and descends to the anterior part of the head and to the forehead, where it appears, and divides in two; these are joined mid-way between the eyes, and again divided each one ministers light to one eye; and this nerve is called the [--ris] and is perforated.) 480 Haec est pares musculi 209 work to open and close the mouth and allow the throat to swallow. In both cases, we find the same importance placed on the head (nerves bringing light to eyes, muscles originating with jaw and throat). This emphasis reinforces the physiological hierarchy that was first introduced in the microcosmic man and taken up by the cautery images. The herbal text, which concludes the section on the anatomical men, offers suggestions of various herbs to be consumed at different times of the year in order to alleviate ailments and promote health within the body.481 This short herbal served two functions. First, like the muscles described in the Historia, it filled a void at the bottom corner of the page following the conclusion of the Historia and its anatomical illustrations. Second, it provides a kind of resolution to the tensions that arise between the text and the illustrations in the preceding. While the Historia describes an ideal of a healthy body, one whose various systems, divinely created, work in harmony to supply unity, protection, and nourishment, the accompanying anatomical images portray bodies that are divided (not one sunt et adiuvant os ut aperiatur et deglutiat et imponant et deponant spiritum (This is the story of the muscles, which the Lord made in order that the void be filled up and what is separate is joined together. There are three kinds: one is flesh; another is neither flesh nor sustenance but something in between; the third is unlike the first and the second and is called muscle, and by means of it the body can be moved and can turn at will. Their origin is in the jaws and they help the mouth and lips to open and in every motion of the mouth they become thick. There are two equal muscles which help the mouth open and swallow, and they put the spirit in place and keep it there.) 481 For example, mense of May [take] gamandrea to subdue the humours. For the month of June [take] celery [seed?] and pepper under the tongue, about a spoonful, to bind the bowels or to loosen them. For the month of July [take] cardonis with five grains of pepper.

The herbal offers a potential method of cure and a restoration of the body's intended health. 3.6. Virtues and Vices (folios 3v-4r, originally folios 4v-5r) Immediately following the anatomical images are two folios with depictions of the virtues and the vices (fig. 183).482 This might seem abrupt and out of place following three sections of medical illustrations portraying the body, its systems, and procedures for healing sickness. But seen within the context of the entire manuscript and its preface, the Pr\u00fcfening virtues and vices contribute to a broader understanding about the meaning of the body and its health. In the first place, the virtues and vices are not abstract ideals but are personified; they possess bodies of their own. Second, their placement within the preface represents the culmination of a movement from representations of the external body, beginning with the figure of the microcosmic man and the sickly cautery patients, to the internal\u2014first with depictions of the body's interior vascular systems and now, deeper still, with images of its hidden ethical motivations within the body's immaterial and invisible soul. In this context, the illustrations of the virtues and vices offer not only examples of morality and sin, but also cures and preventative treatments. They also bring to light the body's most dangerous spiritual pathogen--heresy. 482 Scholarly approaches to these folios have been minimal focusing primarily on locating the biblical sources of the inscriptions and, to some degree, noting correspondences between the vices and virtues. See Boeckler, Regensburg-Pr\u00fcfeninger Buchmalerei, 20-23. Much work remains to fully understand the exegetical relationships between the various scenes. 211 3.6a. Description of the Illustrations The Pr\u00fcfening virtues and vices consist of twelve separate scenes occupying two full facing pages. There is no surrounding or accompanying text apart from what is included just above the top border and within the images. Six examples of vice appear on the left (verso) folio and six corrective virtues appear in the opposite position on the right (recto), arranged in two-by-three grids (figs. 184-185). The images \"mirror\" each other in the sense that those closest to the margin on the left correspond to those closest to the margin on the right, while those along the gutter on both sides match up as well. Each moral example depicts a virtue or vice personified by a female figure and a biblical scene that illustrates the result of each personified quality. The speech enclosed in banderoles held by the vice or virtue identifies their agency within the narrative and in the respective outcome. Further inscriptions offer additional explanatory and associative commentary. With certain small yet significant exceptions, the vices on the left are associated with villains who met their death because of their vicious characteristics, while the virtues on the right are linked to the saintly protagonists who prevailed in the corresponding story. Accordingly, one pair taken from the book of Esther portrays Hamann hanging from the gallows as a result of his vice Ambition (Honoris appetentia), while on the opposite page his antagonist Mordechai is honored by his virtue Patience (Longanimitas). Another, from the Exodus story, shows Pharaoh overcome by the Red Sea because of his vice Violence (Potentia), while opposite Moses is glorified for his Gentleness (Mansuetudo). Drawing on the book of Samuel, on the left King Saul commits suicide as the result of Pride (Gloria), while on the right his opponent David is anointed king as Humility (Humilitas) places the crown. Finally, the adulteress Queen Jezebel, having been trampled to death by horses, is shown being eaten by dogs on account of her allegiance to Sensual Pleasure (Voluptas), 212 while on the other side Elijah, her nemesis in the book of Kings, ascends to heaven in a chariot in the presence of Moderation (Sobrietas). The pairs are further linked together by titles taken from a common biblical verse. Thus, for example, Saul's epitaph is \"God resists the proud,\" while David's continues this passage from James 4:6, \"And gives grace to the humble.\" The two couplets appearing in the top register of the pages, however, do not quite conform to the pattern just described. In the first, on the left, Daughter Babylon receives a chalice \"full of filth and abomination\" (Rev 17:4) from her vice Desire (Cupiditas) while John the Evangelist, author of the book of Revelation from which this event is taken\u2014the only example drawn from the New Testament\u2014 looks on (fig. 186). On the opposite page, by contrast, Daughter Zion receives a \"noble (praeclarus)\" chalice from the virtue of Love (Caritas) witnessed by David, traditional author of the several Psalms that inspired this vignette (fig. 187). It is the presence of the two authors that link the images together, for unlike the other examples, the characters are not taken from a common story, nor do the titles above the images share a common biblical verse; they are simply entitled \"Babylon\" and \"Jerusalem\" respectively. The images of the second couplet in the top register indeed have titles that are taken from the same biblical verse (Ps 33:11),483 but similar to the first, the scenes are not inspired by the same biblical story. The one on the left, in fact, is not biblical at all. It depicts Croesus standing bound before King Cyrus of Persia while a sword bearer behind the throne prepares to dispatch the prisoner as the vice Extravagance (Opulentia) looks on (fig. 188). This is 483 On the left, \"the rich have been in want (Divites eguerunt)\"; on the right, \"but they that seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good (Inquirentes autem dominum non minuentur omni bono).\" 213 based on a story told by the Greek historian Herodotus. According to him, Croesus, who was exceedingly rich, approached the Greek lawgiver Solon and asked him who the most blessed man was, expecting the sage to say himself. Instead, Solon identifies three others, all of whom were dead. The uncertainty of fortune, he explained, meant that true happiness was not attainable until the course of life was complete, for at any time good fortune could be overturned. Croesus's fate, losing his wealth and kingdom to Cyrus and the Persians, proved Solon right. In the Pr\u00fcfening image, the goddess Fortuna is represented with two faces standing on a rotating wheel and bearing a banderole with the caption, \"We turn the wheel with a spinning (or voluntary) motion (rotam volubili giro versamus),\" paraphrasing the philosopher Boethius.484 The corresponding scene on the right, by contrast, is biblical. It features Joseph, the good steward of Pharaoh's household, standing before his brothers who had once betrayed him but now humbly bow before him (fig. 189). Joseph's banderole reads, \"You conceived evil against me, but God turned it into good (vos cogitastis de me malum, sed Deus convertit in bonum)\" (Gen 50:20). His primary virtue, Discretion (Prudentia) stands by and comments that this happened under his direction (dirigo). Joseph's ascent obviously contrasts with the fall of Croesus and is the result not of fate but of the providence of God. Because of their placement at the top, and because of their New Testament and non-Christian connections, as well as their breaking the mold of those that follow, there is reason to think that these two couplets provide a kind of key for understanding the virtues and vices as a whole, as will be discussed below. 484 See Boeckler, p. 25. 214 3.6b. Illustrated Vices and Virtues in Relation to the Medical Images While illustrations of the virtues and vices were common in the Middle Ages, the Pr\u00fcfening version is unique in both its form and its content.485 From a formal perspective, a more common depiction was of a diagrammatic tree whose \"fruit\" becomes either a virtue or vice according to the rootstock (fig. 190).486 Another is of the virtues and vices personified, either as groups or individuals, their status determined by the way they are modeled or the activities performed. A good example is found in the Hortus deliciarum where the virtues and vices are represented by competing armies engaged in warfare or as individuals in one-on-one combat (figs. 191-192).487 While the Pr\u00fcfening examples are indeed personified, they do not fight one another nor are they characterized with a similar frenzy; the Pr\u00fcfening figures, whether virtues or vices, are all robed females with calm demeanors. Instead of following contemporary models to shape the depictions of the virtues and vices, the Pr\u00fcfening monks composed the illustrations to engage visually with the earlier images in the manuscript, especially those of cautery, and thus with ideas about the body, disease, cure, and health. In terms of their form, the table-like arrangement mimics that of the cautery section; the pages of both are divided into rectangular quadrants within which human actors engage in medical dramas. Those in the cautery section are about sickness and cure; those in the section on virtues and vices depict scenes of death opposite scenes of salvation. 485 For early medieval illustrations of the virtues and vices, see Adolf Katzenellenbogen, Allegories of the Virtues and Vices in Medieval Art: From Early Christian Times to the Thirteenth Century (New York: W.W. Norton, 1964). Katzenellenbogen, among other things, demonstrates the wide variety of virtues and vices depicted in various manuscript contexts. 486 Liber floridus, Ghent, University Library, Hortus deliciarum, fol. 200v. 215 The role of the doctor in the latter is assumed by the attendant virtue or vice who, like the cautery doctors, acts as a causative agent, generating either sickness and death or reward and good health. Thus, in the death of Haman, Ambition watches and states \"In this way do I raise [him on the gallows] (sic levo),\" while in the corresponding vignette of Mordechai's triumph, Patience proclaims that it is \"I who save him (salvo).\" In the death of Pharaoh, the banderole of Violence claims \"Thus do I place [him here before the rushing waters] (sic loco),\" while on the opposite side Gentleness \"glorifies (clarifico)\" Moses. Pride takes responsibility for Saul's suicide, \"Thus do I arrange [it] (sic colo),\" while Humility responds \"I bless you (beo)\" as she crowns David. Sensual Pleasure \"makes sport (sic tibi ludo)\" of Jezebel trampled and eaten, while Moderation \"rescues (reservo)\" Elijah. Seen in the context of the preceding medical images, the virtues in these illustrations appear as curing antidotes to the destructive vices. The curative aspect is further suggested by the inscriptions above the borders that surround the two pages of images. Above the folio of vices, we read: \"The lot of animal life is that it be filled with evils; from these [scenes] we are given to know how once recognized we might take precaution (quod repleta malis sit precaveatur).\" Above the page of virtues: \"How abundant in good things is the life whose companion is reason; from these [scenes] let the sober mind consider and aim for this [life] (quam fecunda bonis sit vita hanc mens sobria tendat).\" The preceding pages of cautery illustrations would have reminded the viewer that \"animal life,\" the life that humans share with all living creatures, is indeed filled with \"evils.\" In the former case these are physical maladies, while here they are moral evils, the result of living according to passion. The virtues, by contrast, are the result of living according to reason, a specifically human power. In the cautery images, the art of medicine is the 216 application of reason to bodily maladies. Here moral health is equated with the rational \"sober mind,\" the opposite of drunkenness. The very first couplet, the one that breaks with the pattern of the others and serves as a summation of them all, shows Daughter Babylon receiving from Desire \"a chalice filled with the filth and abomination of her fornication\" (Rev 17:4) while proclaiming \"Let us fill ourselves with costly wine (vino precioso nos impleamus)\" (Wis 2:9).488 The antidote to this poison is found on the opposite page where Daughter Zion takes from Love the healing cup of salvation (salutari tuo) while David stands by and opines that \"They are intoxicated by the abundance of your house (inebriabuntur ab ubertate domus tuae).\"489 There is a certain paradox in the idea of the \"companion of reason\" possessing a \"sober mind\" that is \"intoxicated\" with Love's healing potion. In ancient thought the virtues and vices were contrasted as the habituated outcomes of rational and irrational behavior. To be virtuous was to be reasonable and sober, while dishonor resulted from giving in to the passions that were likened to intoxication. In Christianity, sober virtue remained the ideal, but standing above the traditional moral virtues, which were acquired by habit, were the theological virtues acquired by God's grace\u2014faith, hope, and, above all, love. These virtues transcended reason, as it were, and represented another form of intoxication, not one based 488 In this scene, John the Evangelist stands by and opines, quoting from Revelation 18:3, \"Because all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication (Quia de vino ir\u00e6 fornicationis ejus biberunt chapter references the woman as \"holding in her hand a golden chalice filled with abomination and the impurity of her fornication in offering her cup, says \"My chalice which inebriates me, est\" (Ps 22:5), while will rejoice in your salvation (Exultabo in salutari tuo)\" (Ps 9:16). The inscription in the architectural arch reads: \"We are filled with good things in your house, God (Replebimur in bonis domus tue, deus)\" (Ps 64:5), echoing the bonis referred to in the general caption above the folio of virtues and contrasting with the maladies (malis) referenced in the opposite heading of the vices. 217 on selfish aims such as sensual desire, luxury, ambition, power, pleasure, or self-glory, but on passion for the love of God. In the Pr\u00fcfening illustration, Caritas is surrounded by Jerusalem's four towers that are identified with the principal moral virtues: Discretion (prudentia), Justice (iustitia), Courage (fortitudo), and Temperance (temperentia); Caritas wears a crown\u2014and she alone among the virtues is depicted with one\u2014thus signaling her supremacy. Love, it appears, is the ultimate medicine. 3.6c The Danger of Paganism and Heresy? The scenes of virtues and vices resonate not only with the cautery images but also with the other medical illustrations considered thus far. The emphasis of this section on reason\u2014albeit a reason intoxicated with love\u2014ties it into to a major theme of the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript and its illustrated preface: the importance of the head in the bodily hierarchy and of keeping vigilant watch over the mind. Indeed, the titular inscription for the folio of vices counsels that knowledge gained from looking at these base scenes is to be taken with great caution. There is at least some evidence on these folios to suggest that the rational mind needed to be on guard against not only the deadly vices but also against the dangers of pagan learning and even heresy, the deadliest pathogen of them all. The virtue, Sobrietas (temperance, but also good sense) linked to the moral mind is represented by Elijah who confronts the heretical King Ahab regarding his worship of the pagan god, Baal. Elijah makes the rational judgment to put his faith in God instead of the pagan statue (mihi autem adherere deo bonum est) (Psalm 72: 28). In addition, the scene depicting Croesus, described above, taken not from the Bible but from a Greek author and featuring a pagan goddess bearing a quote from a pagan philosopher, is perhaps a warning about becoming too 218 intoxicated with secular learning. While Croesus is an example of Extravagance, a kind of overindulgence, Joseph his counterpart is a paragon of Discretion or Prudentia, the ability to be cautious and circumspect with the goods, whether material or intellectual, at his disposal. There is also a striking parallel between the vices chosen to be portrayed and those found in the Life of Mohammed (Istoria de Mahomet), the great prophet of Islam.490 Much of the new learning, especially in the field of medical knowledge, was transmitted through Arabic texts and sometimes accompanied by references to the Islamic religion. Islam was increasingly seen as a threat to Christian values, especially for scholars who engaged with its texts. The Life of Mohammed, an anti-hagiographical work, was written in the West towards the end of the eleventh century. According to the Life, Mohammed, an orphan, desired a much older and wealthy widow (Cupiditas) and became a usurer (Opulentia). Like Pharaoh and Saul, who are depicted in the Pr\u00fcfening Vice folio, Mohammed became a military leader 490 The anti-hagiographical account of the Life of Mohammed was written by Embrico of Mainz in the eleventh century. For this text and other contemporary Western works criticizing Islam and Mohammed, see Medieval Latin Lives of Muhammad, ed. and trans. Julian Yolles and Jessica Weiss (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2018). Another important twelfth-century work is heresy Saracens or ordered the translation of an important ninth-century anti-Islamic polemic called the Apology of al-Kind\u00ee. For more on this translation and general information on Peter's approach to Islam, see Scott G. Bruce, Cluny and the Muslims of La Garde-Freinet: Hagiography and the Problem of Islam in Medieval Europe (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 2015), esp. 117-119; and James Kritzeck, Peter the Venerable and Islam (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1964). Other contemporary Western sources on Islam are cited in Suzanne Conklin Akbari, Idols in the East: European Representations of Islam and the Orient, 1100-1450 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2009), 200-247; John Tolan, Sons of Ishmael: Muslims through European Eyes in the Middle Ages (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2008), esp. Ch. 4; Dominique Iogna-Prat, Order and Exclusion. Cluny and Christendom Face Heresy Judaism and Islam (1000-1150), trans. by Graham Robert Edwards (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002), esp. 323-57. Some of the vices named in the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript were also linked to Jews. Anna Sapir Abulafia, \"Bodies in the Jewish-Christian Debate\" in Medieval Religion: New Approaches, ed. Constance Hoffman Berman (New York: Routledge, 2004), 320-333. 219 with ambitions for worldly power (Honoris appetentia and Potentia). Once he attained them, he was said to have created laws that allowed him to commit adultery and engage in sensual pleasures and fornication (Voluptas and Cupiditas), charges that were also laid on the daughter of Babylon and Jezebel, who also appear in the Vice narratives. Lastly, after Mohammed's death, the Istoria claims that his body was eaten by a pack of dogs\u2014a scene replicated in the image of Jezebel's death.491 Further, Mohammed and the Muslims were associated by Christians with the city of Babylon, the architectural setting of the first Vice image representing Cupiditas.492 In the eleventh-century Song of Roland, for example, the leader of the Islamic forces is called the \"emir of Babylon,\" and Gauthier de Compi\u00e8gne (d. twelfth century) places the tomb of Mohammed there. Moreover, the common medieval criticism of Mohammed as being not of sound mind is related to the overall understanding of the vices suggested by the folio's title. The Life of Mohammed calls him irrational for his \"false testimony\" in the Qur'an, which offers different versions of the psalms and of events found in the Old Testament.493 While there is no direct proof that the author of the Pr\u00fcfening 491 Kenneth Baxter Wolf, \"Christian Views of Islam in Early Medieval Spain,\" in Medieval Christian Perceptions of Islam, 85-108, at 93-94. Other versions of the story claimed that Mohammed's corpse is destroyed by pigs. See Tolan, Sons of Ishmael, 16. 492 Tolan, Sons of Ishmael, 27. For another visual example of the connection between Islam and Babylon, see Anne Derbes, \"A Crusading Fresco Cycle at the Cathedral of Le Puy,\" Art Bulletin 67 (1991): 561-76, 574-5. For Augustine's contrast between Jerusalem and Babylon, see Johannes Van Oort, Jerusalem and Babylon: A Study into Augustine's \"City of God\" and the Sources of His Doctrine of the Two Cities (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1991). 493 For an account of the distinctions between the three traditions, see F.E. Peters, Muhammad and the Origins of Islam (Albany: State University of New York, 1994); and Charles Cutler Torrey, The Jewish Foundation of Islam (New York: Jewish Institute of Religion Press, 1933, repub. by New York: KTAV Pub, 1968). Peter the Venerable attributed Muslim error to their following the Talmudic text instead of the Old Testament. Irven Resnick, \"Peter the Venerable on the Talmud, the Jews, and Islam,\" Medieval Encounters 24 (2018): 510-529. According to Peter, the Talmud \"not only contains anti-Christian blasphemies, it also impedes the proper functioning of human reason in Jewish readers.\" Adversus Iudeorum Inveteratam Duritiem (Against the Inveterate Obduracy of the Jews), 220 virtues and vices had Mohammed in mind, the lure of Arabic science\u2014its highly rational (and un-theological) approach to the nature of body and the creation of the universe\u2014posed a real danger to the Christian student, tempting him with heresy. It may have been something the Pr\u00fcfening monks needed to be on guard against lest it infect their own minds. 3.7 Jerusalem (folio 4v, originally 5v) Following the illustrations of the virtues and vices is an image of the city of Jerusalem (fig. 193). Once again this may seem like an odd choice, coming as it does after images that focused on the human body, its ailments, systems, and interior states. Elisabeth Klemm identified the picture as signifying the Heavenly Jerusalem, regarded as the Christian's ultimate eschatological goal.494 The preceding cautery illustrations and scenes of conflict between vice and virtue, she argued, represented the physical and spiritual trials that each monk must endure to attain salvation. Yet a closer look at the Pr\u00fcfening page shows not the divine city described by the prophets and the Book of Revelation, but Jerusalem as it existed in the late seventh century while under Muslim rule. Seen in the context of the 1165 preface, following images that focused on the individual body, here we have a depiction of the communal body, but one that is \"sick\" and in need of a salvific \"cure.\" Klemm's analysis may have been influenced by the many maps of Jerusalem produced during the twelfth century that do, in fact, relate the city, now in the hands of Christian Crusaders, to the Heavenly Jerusalem. At least ten maps of Jerusalem survive from trans. Alex J. Novikoff, in Twelfth Century Renaissance: A Reader, ed. Alex J. Novikoff, 160-162 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2017). 494 Regensburg Buchmalerei, 41. 221 this period, seven of which depict a city with circular exterior walls and two main interior streets that intersect to form a cross shape (figs. 194-195).495 The other three have differing exterior forms, but all are symmetrical in shape.496 All of the maps show five gates to the city and most include important Christian monuments such as the Holy Sepulcher, the Templum Domini (as renamed by the Crusaders, formerly the Dome of the Rock), and David's Tower. These maps with their formal symmetry, religious symbolism, and emphasis on Christian topography present an ideal image of the Crusaders' triumph and make an eschatological connection to the Heavenly Jerusalem in the world to come. The Pr\u00fcfening image of Jerusalem looks different from any other surviving image of the city produced in the twelfth century. It is not round or square or symmetrical in any way but rather an irregular polygon that appears misshapen. It uniquely includes six gates and no monuments are identified. There is indeed a Christian cross, but it is shown surmounted by a pagan statue. And instead of an account of the Crusaders' victory, the text above the image at the top of the page is the beginning of Bede's De locis sanctis, a work based on the account of a seventh-century pilgrim to the Holy Land, which was at that time under Islamic 495 Stuttgart, W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek, Cod. 776, fol. 50v (beginning of the twelfth century). For other medieval maps of Jerusalem, see Milka Levy-Rubin and Rehav Rubin, \"The Image of the Holy City in Maps and Mapping,\" in City of the Great King: Jerusalem from David to the Present, ed. Nitza Rosovsky (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, \"From Eusebius to the Crusader Maps: The Origin of the Holy Land Maps,\" in Visual Constructs of Jerusalem, eds. Biana Pal\u00e4stina-Vereins 14 (1895): general, see P.D.A. Harvey, \"The Sawley Map and Other (square); London, BL, Harley MS 658, fol. 39v (round, 4 gates, but also includes other holy sites in the area and a pilgrim itinerary). 222 control.497 No earlier surviving manuscript of Bede's text includes an image of Jerusalem, and it is likely that the picture was created de novo at Pr\u00fcfening. The first chapter of De locis sanctis, the selection included in the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript, provides a bird's-eye sketch of the city. Bede describes the walls of Jerusalem and six gates that offer entrance to its interior, characteristics that are reflected in the drawing. Most of the remaining text is not depicted in the illustration, but it is noteworthy for its use of bodily imagery to describe aspects of the city. Thus, Mount Zion appears as the head when Bede describes its eyebrows (supercilium) and forehead (frontem); and the digestive process is suggested by the \"filth (sordibus)\"\u2014a word often used with reference to bodily secretion\u2014that leaves the city during the rains via the eastern gate. The use of bodily attributes to describe Jerusalem is not unique to Bede. The practice contributed to a prevailing idea that Jerusalem was also a kind of microcosm. Beginning in the ninth century, Jerusalem began to be depicted geometrically. Bianca K\u00fchnel associates this change to the increasing interest in astronomy and the cosmos as well as New Testament allusions to the perfection of the universe, which also began to be illustrated using geometrical shapes.498 By the twelfth century, the perfection of the universe was likened to 497 De locis sanctis was a new work in the Pr\u00fcfening library in 1165. It was part of a single volume that also included St. Hilary of Poitiers (ca. 310-367), De trinitate, and his Commentary on Matthew. For the monastery's library inventories, see Ineichen-Eder, Mittelalterliche Bibliothekskataloge, 423 & 425. Composed in the early eighth century, De locis sanctis was based on Adomn\u00e1n's written account of Arculf's pilgrimage to Jerusalem, alleged to have occurred in the late seventh century. Bede amended Adomn\u00e1n's text and shortened it to approximately one-third the length. Joshua A. Westgard, \"Bede and the Continent in the Carolingian Age and Beyond,\" in The Cambridge Companion to Bede, ed. Scott DeGregorio (Cambridge, MA & New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010), 201-215; and M.L.W. Laistner, A Hand-list of Bede Manuscripts (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1943). No other manuscript copy of the work contains an illustration of Jerusalem; however many depict diagrams of architecture found there. Patrick P. O'Neill, \"Imag(in)ing the Holy Places: A Comparison between the Diagrams in Adomn\u00e1n's and Bede's locis K\u00fchnel, \"Geography and Geometry of Jerusalem,\" in City of the Great King, 288-322. 223 the perfected Jerusalem under Crusader rule, and this is manifested in the symmetrical depictions of the city from the same time.499 Yet the illustration of Jerusalem in Pr\u00fcfening is asymmetrical, it is not a perfect microcosm, and in many ways is the antithesis of the manuscript's microcosmic man. While Bede's text describes the city as circular (a perfect shape), the irregular shape of the image's walls clearly contradicts the text.500 Like the bodies that follow the microcosm in the cautery images, the Pr\u00fcfening Jerusalem is imperfect and diseased. As noted above, the prologue to the original manuscript of 1158 describes the ideal monastery as one where all its gates are closed and guarded. In the image of Jerusalem, however, there are no guards and all but one of the gates is wide open. The one closed has gates labeled \"very small (parvula)\" and is further emphasized by a descriptive inscription taken from the text and placed above--the only gate to receive such attention--\"the gate from which one descends by steps to the valley of Josaphat (ab hac per gradus ad vallem iosaphat descenditur)\" (fig. 196). According to the text, this gate also happens to be the same 499 Jay Rubenstein, \"Heavenly and Earthly Jerusalem: The View from Twelfth-Century Flanders,\" in Visual Constructs of Jerusalem, 265-276, see esp. 269-270. The Liber floridus, whose map of Jerusalem is associated with a crusade chronicle, also treats Jerusalem as the microcosm of the world. Saint-Omer, Biblioth\u00e8que municipal, MS Jaspert (Frankfurt: Camput, 2001), 271-334. Note that later illustrations link the body of Christ with a circular universe and a circular Jerusalem placed in the center, also at Christ's navel. See for example, the Ebstorf map (thirteenth century, destroyed in 1943). Kupfer, \"Medieval World Maps,\" 263. 500 The text uses the adverb \"paene (almost)\" to describe the circle and perhaps this provides the opportunity for the monks to adjust the city's shape. Note also that the original pilgrim account describes Jerusalem as a four-sided square and Bede changes this description to circular. Rodney Aist, From Topography to Text: The Image of Jerusalem in the Writings of Eucherius, Adomn\u00e1n and Bede (Turnhout: Brepols, 2018), 120. 224 one through which the filth of the city is supposed to escape.501 The refuse, it seems, remains within Jerusalem. Evidence of the city's illness is also marked by the appearance of a pagan statue in the illustration, a feature that is not named in the Bede text, but which the Pr\u00fcfening monks have chosen to represent (fig. 197).502 The statue depicts a figure with sun-like rays emerging from his head.503 Its placement over a cross indicates not only the figure's higher status but also its active suppression of Christianity. In the twelfth century, Crusader accounts claimed that the Muslims worshiped an idol called the Star of Remhan and the rays emitting from the head of the Pr\u00fcfening statue may allude to this.504 The connection is further substantiated by 501 Bede's text describes the gate twice, first as a very small gate from which the road descends into the valley of Josaphat (ab hac per gradus ad vallem iosaphat descendit[ur]) and second as the gate out of which the filth (sordibus) leaves the flowing through the eastern gates in the form of rivers, [the rain] increases the torrent of Cedron in the valley of Josaphat, carrying with it all the filth of the street). 502 It is possible that the statue represents the Roman emperor, Aelius Hadrian, who is mentioned in the text that appears in Pr\u00fcfening. The text recounts that the emperor was also called Helia (vocatur Helia) or the sun, which may be reflected in the star-like rays emerging from the head of the statue and which would have recalled the ancient pagan custom of emperor worship. The depiction may also relate to a particular statue described at end of the second chapter of De locis sanctis, but not included in the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript, which is said to have represented the solstice, placed over a cross, and located in the middle of the earth asserts that the statue represents Christ-Helios, however his argument is based on Early Christian likenesses and theology. Verdier also fails to examine the illustration within the context and meaning of the manuscript. 504 This connection is explored in Akbari, Idols in the East, 205. Summarizing her argument, in the twelfth century, Muslims were portrayed as returning to pre-Christian worship, either paganism or a form of Judaism. One of their devotions was said to be to this idol. It also should be noted that recent scholarship has suggested that Bede's De locis sanctis makes disparaging references to \"saracens,\" a term also used by Jerome and Isidore to refer to the pre-Islamic people of Arabia who descended from Abraham's son Ishmael. In his redaction of the pilgrim text, Bede maintains many of the references to the Saracens in Jerusalem, including a reference to a mosque on the Temple Mount: In inferior vero trabibus super 225 a similar depiction of a man with rays emitting from his head that is found in another twelfth-century manuscript from a Bavarian monastery (fig. 198).505 In this illustration, the head performs a star-like function, proudly leading the Daughter of Babylon into her namesake city, a city that, as discussed above, was associated with Islam and more typically with pagans or idol worshipers. In the Pr\u00fcfening Jerusalem, the statue represents the \"head\" and is placed at the bottom of the illustration while the \"blocked bowel\" appears at the top--a clear inversion of the ideal hierarchical body and another symbol of a corrupted and diseased Jerusalem. No longer linked to the divine or representing perfection and the Heavenly Jerusalem of the world to come, this image represents a pagan Jerusalem, which, within the context of the manuscript, serves as a counterpoint to the Christ-centered microcosm at the beginning of the manuscript. The text ends with a sentence taken from a later chapter in the De locis sanctis: \"But I have said each of these things so that you might recognize more clearly what I have also taken care to depict before your eyes (sed the inscriptions that border the Virtues and Vices, this added text calls the viewer's attention to images below--images that reshape and assemble for prayer. There they have built a square house of shoddy workmanship with upright planks and great beams over certain remains of the ruins [of the Jewish temple near the eastern wall]. It seems to hold three thousand people) (2.3, lines 53-8). Bede also makes notable changes to the text that connect Saracens with heresy. Cited in Calvin B.

In this way, the page is like that of the anatomical men, for it contains a text describing an idealized version of a city contrasted with illustrations of the disorder and corruption within. Unlike both of these sections, however, no remedy appears on the page itself. Instead, the cure is found in what follows. 3.8 The Pr\u00fcfening Treasury Inventory (folio 5v, formerly folio 6v) The final pages of the illustrated preface of 1165 contain a list of the contents of Pr\u00fcfening Abbey's liturgical treasury and books (figs. 199-201). The treasury inventory itself occupies folio 5v and the books follow on folios 6r and 6v. The latter appears unfinished, with the books listed in five columns divided by red lines and the various sections separated by simple arches drawn in black.507 The treasury list, however, is sumptuously illustrated and replete with symbolism that is key to interpreting the entirety of the manuscript and its preface. 3.8a. Description The treasury inventory on fol. 5v is placed within a large symmetrical shape representing a banner that, as will be shown, is evocative of other forms as well. It is surrounded by a golden background and held aloft by several figures penned in red and black ink who represent the abbey's spiritual patrons. At the top and center is Christ, identifiable by his halo marked with a cross. To the left (Christ's right) is Otto, former bishop of 507 The double lines may have been planned as columns like those used as dividing tools in the cautery images, but they remain unfinished. In addition, space is left between the arches and the double lines at the top of the library folios as if column capitals were planned but not executed. Space is also left within the columns for book additions. 227 Bamberg, who was the founder of the monastery; to the right, St. George, the monastery's titular saint. Just below them on either side are two angels who also support the banner. The bottom is held up, on the left, by Erbo, the former abbot who was responsible for accumulating the treasury, and on the right by the contemporary abbot, Eberhard; both appear inside the banner itself. At the bottom of the page, outside the banner, are several other figures: on the left, another Eberhard, the contemporary bishop of Bamberg, on the right, the Apostle Paul, and at the very bottom, below them, are five unnamed monks, recognizable by their tonsures, who look upwards towards the banner. The list itself begins with items that adorn the altar as part of the liturgical ceremonies. These are followed by objects associated with the priest, the ministers, and the choir. Finally listed are articles that decorate the church such as tapestries and curtains. All items mentioned were made of costly materials, such as silver and silk, and together they represent the monetary wealth of the monastery. On the following two pages, the list continues with the monastery's intellectual wealth, the prized books in its library collection. Despite an earlier book inventory that mentions ancient non-Christian works, the only ones listed on these folios are religious works by renowned Christian authors.508 508 In addition to the Fathers of the Church, the Pr\u00fcfening list names contemporaries such as Bernard Clairvaux, Peter Abelard, Hugh of St. Victor, William of Conches, Peter Lombard, Rupert of Deutz and Honorius Augustodunensis. The earlier library inventory of ca. 1158 includes Priscian, Boethius, Virgil, Lucan, Ovid, and Marcian, but no medical authors (including those named in the cautery images).

The early book inventory is the Pr\u00fcfening Tradition Book, Munich, Bayerisches Monastic Body The idea of the body has been a consistent theme throughout the images of the 1165 preface: the perfect body of the microcosmic man; the sickly bodies of the cautery patients; the interior bodies of the anatomical men; the body's inner moral state personified as vices and virtues; and the corporate social body signified by the earthly Jerusalem. It is no surprise then that the final section, the illustrated treasury inventory, is also filled with bodily imagery. There are the bodies of the individual figures, of course. But taken together the elements of the page work together to represent the perfected \"body\" of the Pr\u00fcfening monastic community. To begin with, the banner containing the inventory calls to mind an animal hide stretched upon a frame (part of the process of making parchment) and is thus representative of the body's outer skin (figs. 202-203).509 Furthermore, the text within the lower portion of the banner tapers off in a manner strikingly similar to the end of the digestive tract, evoking the images of the squatting anatomical men depicted earlier. From this perspective, the liturgical items of the inventory serve as the inner organs, the systems that nourish the body and allow it to properly function. The head of the body, emerging from the swell of the banner's \"neck\" at the top is Christ, whose own head, surrounded by the crossed halo, extends into the margin beyond the border of the golden background. The angels on either side function as the body's arms, the active agents of God's will in the world, while the monks at the bottom of the page are the feet, lowly and humble yet the support that allows the body of Christ to stand firm upon the earth. The personalities portrayed collectively 509 Bamberg, Staatsbibliothek, Msc. Patr. 5, 4, 2\u00b0, fol. 183v. Note that the tool used to scrape the thick hide into thin parchment is similar to one form of cautery tool, also applied to the skin. I would like to thank Dr. Jim Bugslag for this insight. 229 represent the Pr\u00fcfening community, past, present, and eternal: the founder Bishop Otto; its heavenly patrons St. George and St. Paul; Abbot Erbo, who was responsible for its material prosperity; the present abbot and bishop, both named Eberhard; and the anonymous company of ordinary monks. The idea of the church, whether the universal Church or particular local ones\u2014including monasteries\u2014as a collective \"body\" was as old as Christianity itself. In the First Letter to the Corinthians, St. Paul writes, \"For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, whereas they are many, yet are one body, so also is Christ\" (1 Cor 12:12). \"Now you\"\u2014the members of the church of Corinth\u2014\"are Christ's body, and individually parts of it\" (1 Cor 12:27). In another Pauline letter, to the Ephesians, Christ is described as the \"head of the Church\" (Eph 5:23) and Christians \"members of his body\" (Eph 5:30). In First Corinthians, Paul goes on to describe the \"more excellent way\" of love (caritas) that is the bonding force of this body (1 Cor. 12:31-13:13)\u2014the same virtue depicted earlier in the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript as supreme and the antidote to the vice of personal desire (Cupiditas) that was destructive of the communal body. That the Pr\u00fcfening monks indeed thought of themselves as constituting a single collective body is indicated in the prologue to the original manuscript of 1158, which says that although \"some [members] are usefully devoted to contemplation, some to scholarship, some to various trades, and some to administration of external business, nevertheless, gathered together within the closed and guarded door of the monastery, they are but a single spirit with one heart and one soul.\" This clearly echoes the First Corinthians text quoted above and uses a similar rhetoric by describing the individual members of Christ's body 230 engaged in a diversity of activities (1 Cor 12:5-11).510 It is against this theological background that St. Paul, whose presence is otherwise inexplicable, makes an appearance at the bottom right of the treasury page.511 The Pr\u00fcfening monastic body should not be likened to the corruptible bodies of the cautery patients or the earthly Jerusalem. The body portrayed here is an ideal body, a perfect body, the monastic body as it was intended to be. The image is a mirror of the microcosm which appears on the first page. The Christ who is the head of the treasury list is remarkably similar to the face of the microcosmic man, who also has a halo, beard, and long hair parted in the middle. The Christ of the treasury list is also cut off at the chest by the banner he holds, just as the microcosm's body is divided at the chest, the site of the breath or \"spirit,\" by a single line that also sets up a hierarchical ordering of the body. The contents of the treasury inventory are listed according to their own hierarchy, with the items of the altar coming first, those associated with the ministers of the altar next, and those that decorate the surrounding church last.512 So too do the figures on the page appear hierarchically: Christ the head at the 510 \"There are different forms of service but the same Lord; there are different workings but the same God who produces all of them in everyone. To each individual the manifestation of the Spirit is given for some benefit. To one is given through the Spirit the expression of wisdom; to another the expression of knowledge according to the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit; to another mighty deeds; to another prophecy; to another discernment of spirits; to another varieties of tongues; to another interpretation of tongues. But one and the same Spirit produces all of these, distributing them individually to each person as he wishes.\" 511 Klemm, \"Die Klostergemeinschaft von Pr\u00fcfening,\" 43, notes that there is no documented connection between St. Paul and the monastery. He was not a patron of the monastery nor did the monastery hold any relics of his body. She provides two other valid suggestions for his appearance. The day of the death and remembrance of Otto of Bamberg was also the feast day of the Apostle (June 30th). Second was the leitmotiv of caritas within the monastery and the focus on the love of God in his scroll. Paul holds a banderole that reads: \"May he be cursed whoever does not love the Lord Jesus (Qui non amat dominum iesum sit are arrayed in the church, these are the altar, the priest, the ministers, the choir [and then] the surrounding areas of the church). 231 top, followed by the heavenly patron saints and angels, the present-day leadership, and at the bottom the humble monks. Lastly, the perfect symmetry of the microcosmic man set in an otherworldly context is replicated by the symmetry of the treasury banner, which, despite its unusual shape, is equal on both sides and set against a heavenly background of gold. The balanced placement of Bishop Otto, St. George, St. Paul, and Bishop Eberhard at the four corners both contributes to the sense of Christ in heavenly majesty and echoes the placement of the elements that formed the macrocosm in the earlier image. Not only does the illustrated treasury image depict the perfected monastic body modeled after the Christ-like microcosmic man but it also tells how this body came to be and offers a prescription for maintaining its good health and preventing its corruption. In the upper left, Bishop Otto is identified as having constructed the monastery in the year of the Lord 1108. In his banderole, he asserts his role in the foundation, \"I planted these goods (hec bona plantavi),\" while on the right St. George claims his part in its continuing prosperity, \"I watered what was planted with my prayers (precibus plantata rigavi).\"513 Christ responds that he is \"touched by the eagerness of [your] plantings precantis).\" In the left-hand margin of the banner, the viewer is told that he is welcome to make use of these goods, the treasures found therein, but that he should give back more than what he took from its flesh (carne).514 In the margin on the right, 513 The analogy of the seed to the body was not uncommon in the Middle Ages and St. Paul, depicted on the folio, uses the metaphor to describe the potential of the human body for growth and development (I Cor. 15: 35-41). In other respects, the use of vegetal imagery is appropriate. While the abbey was founded in 1109, it wasn't until 1114 that Bishop Otto \"transplanted\" monks from Hirsau to begin the divine to whom are owed the things seen summarized here, to whom much grace remains, bring back from among these things what is buried in the flesh, provided you multiply it with interest.\" 232 the viewer is encouraged to add to the treasure so that \"what was already there will stand undefiled (das majora stent intemerata priora).\"515 At the bottom, Bishop Eberhard warns that \"whoever does presume to diminish these items will be found to have less, for he defrauds God whom he is supposed to love.\"516 And St. Paul ratifies this statement by calling down a curse upon \"anyone who does not love the Lord Jesus.\"517 At the very bottom, the monks look upward and in unison give their consent, \"Amen, let it be so, let it be so. Amen, let it be so. Amen. (Amen fiat fiat Amen fiat amen)\" Their fiat calls to mind the word spoken by God in the book of Genesis as he brought creation\u2014the macrocosm and microcosm\u2014into being. It is also notable that the monks gaze upward and appear to keep vigilant watch over the two openings between the banners above (at the top and bottom), resonating with an important theme of the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript. The prologue to the 1158 manuscript analogizes the monastery to a city, with all openings barred and locked (quos tamen una omnes foris arta monasterii clausura et custodia). In addition, while the banner seems to mimic an animal skin, it also resembles a shield, both of which provide a protective function for a body; and while separate pages contain the inventory of religious books, the main text within the banner describes them as \"spiritual weapons\" (arma spiritualia) (you whose concern is free to add more to these things, when you give greater things, what was already there will stand undefiled so that you might live in future honor by the law of peace). The adjective intemerata has implications for both the bodily soul (undefiled) and the treasures (whole or undiminished) which, if more are added, will not have to be sold or melted down in case of hard times. 516 Haec minuens \"armory\" (armarie\u2014a play similar word, armarium, for book chest). The Pr\u00fcfening monastic body, therefore, while well provided for at its inception, is in need of both continual nourishment\u2014the prayers of its patron saints and new donations to its treasury and book inventories\u2014and of constant protection from outside threats. The best safeguard in this case is the unity of the monks maintained by a genuine love (caritas) of God. 3.9 Conclusion The medical images in the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript play an important role in a larger program for the reinvigoration of the monastery. While individually these illustrations offer practical medical knowledge, their import lies in the function they serve within the preface--to envisage a perfect spiritual \"monastic body\" through which its members can achieve salvation. Throughout the Pr\u00fcfening preface, spiritual progress is conceived in terms appropriate for bodies: health, disease (physical and moral), and cure. Visually, these same concepts are represented in multiple ways. Health is depicted by order, symmetry, and balance such as that found in the microcosm and treasury page. Disorder, awkwardly shaped bodies, violent scenes of death, and oddly excluded scenes represent sickness and sin. Cure is visually signaled by healing tools and texts. Viewed as a whole, the illustrated preface offers a narrative of salvation history beginning with Creation and the Christ-like microcosm whose physiology mimics the harmonious universe. The cautery patients, anatomical men, and personifications of vice and virtue represent the divided and diseased bodies, physically and morally, that are the result of the Fall. Each offers the available cures or preventative medicines understood as \"remedies\" against internal disharmonies or external \"pathogens.\" The sickly city of Jerusalem is the antithesis of the microcosm, a kind of antichrist, led by a false prophet, and offering no cures. 234 This diseased Jerusalem heralds the final image of the preface, the ideal spiritual body--headed by Christ; nurtured and protected externally by the saints and internally by treasured holy objects and books; and supported by the reformed monks whose eyes and minds are focused above. It is this vision that the Pr\u00fcfening monks must keep before their eyes, a vision of the monastery as \"one spirit, one heart and one soul (intus unus spiritus unum cor una anima colligebat)\" through which the individual members may come to know God. 235 Conclusion: The Art of Twelfth-Century Monastic Medicine The twelfth century has famously been called a renaissance, a time when knowledge lost since the end of Antiquity returned to the Latin West, when alternatives to traditional monastic educational institutions began to emerge, and when ancient programs of instruction reappeared for subjects other than religion.518 It is within this long-held narrative that scholars have typically framed the medical illustrations of the period, seeing them as revived fragments of Late Antique secular knowledge that contributed to the early formative stages of university medical education. This dissertation has shown that when it comes to twelfth-century medical images, the renaissance narrative, if not wholly misleading, is at least incomplete. The examination of the three manuscripts here, while limited in scope, makes it possible to draw very different conclusions about the meaning and function of medical imagery during the twelfth century. It has shown that a richer understanding of such images is gained by considering them both in their manuscript context and from the perspective of the monastic communities that produced them. First, with regard to the manuscript context, the dissertation has shown that in the three case studies the medical illustrations were accompanied by a wide range of texts and other images that were not just medical in content. While in Harley 1585 the images of cautery procedures are combined with texts on medical theory and those related to the Ps.-Apuleius version of materia medica, the medical images in the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript are 518 See, for example, Winthrop Wetherbee, \"Philosophy, and the Twelfth-Century Renaissance,\" of Twelfth-Century Philosophy, ed. Peter Dronke (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988); Robert L Benson and Giles Constable, eds., Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century (Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1982); and Charles Homer Haskins, Renaissance of the Twelfth Century (Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1927, repr. New York, 1955). Cf. C. Stephen Jaeger, Twelfth-Century Renaissance,\" principally accompanied by a glossary and in Hunter 100 by computus materials. Even in other twelfth-century manuscripts, medical illustrations were placed alongside a variety of different texts\u2014from those that are clearly medical, such as Gariopontus's Passionarious, to those that are not, such as the poem Liber ad Honore Augusti by Petrus de Ebulo.519 In addition, the manuscripts themselves provide clues that imply a range of intended audiences and functions. While the small size of Harley 1585 and Hunter 100 indicate that they were made for an individual viewer and independent reading, the enormity of the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript suggests a larger audience, perhaps a book meant to be put on display. The marginal notations in Harley 1585 do imply that it may have been used in the practice of someone medically trained, but none of these works appears to have been used in pedagogical setting. Second, a consideration of the monastic context for the production of these manuscripts and their images has revealed a whole other layer of possible meanings. It was monks, not professional doctors or medical students, who actively obtained the ancient medical materials and copied them using luxurious and expensive materials. They added other texts and images and placed each in a specific order intended to create further relationships that would have been discernable through the monastic intellectual and spiritual practice of meditatio. This method of reflection, grounded in associational thinking, supported a polyvalent interpretation of images, texts, and even manuscripts as a whole. This is not to say that the monks discounted the literal meaning of medical illustrations. But the literal meaning often suggested, metaphorically, symbolically, or by association other interpretations that met the needs not only of physical health but of the intellectual, spiritual, 519 Milan, Ambrosiana, Codex Ambrosianus D 2; and Berne, Burgerbibliothek, and institutional \"health\" of a specific monastic audience. For this reason, it was important to consider, as far as possible, the historical and political situation of each monastery where the manuscript was produced. Summary of Medical Illustrations by Type Three main types of medical illustrations were explored in this study: surgical procedures, medical authorities, and anatomy. These were not found to be mere copies of late antique exemplars, for no two images of the same procedure or persons are exactly alike. In some cases, even such essential medical elements as the number and placements of cautery marks differ. At the same time, it was shown that these differences cannot be attributed to copying errors made by careless or uninformed monks. Rather, the images were carefully constructed to reflect the needs and outlooks of the communities in question. What follows is a summary of findings for each type of illustration, including the different visual strategies employed and their possible meaning and function. Surgical Procedures The surgical practices portrayed in the three manuscripts include both cautery procedures (burning or cutting the skin with a hot iron) and those involving incision with a knife. Scholars have largely treated the two as separate types as well as seeing them as unmediated windows onto actual practice. In these manuscripts, however, cautery and incision are linked together and the illustrations serve purposes that are not necessarily practical. This is almost certainly the case for Hunter 100, whose surgical illustrations are not accompanied by any texts or identifying labels. Only in Harley do we find a small selection of such images that show any interest in applied medicine; the remainder, however, lack the 238 details one would expect if they were to be of any use in performing a procedure. Rather, for all three manuscripts, the surgical images\u2014replete with Christian symbolism and iconographical references\u2014were above all intended for contemplation. Moreover, seen in the contexts of their manuscripts and the institutions that produced them, these images formed part of a larger web of meaning that was not about medicine for its own sake but related to theology and monastic ideology. From a medieval Christian perspective, the idea of surgery had two main connotations. On the one hand, as a means of last resort for dealing with disease, surgery stood as a metaphor for the radical measures necessary for rooting out sin, which was understood as a sickness of the soul. On the other hand, surgery for those who endured it was an occasion for acute pain and suffering, and in this the patient shared in the suffering of Christ, a central tenant in the process of salvation. All three manuscripts' depictions of surgery resonate with both of these themes. In Harley 1585, however, the emphasis is on the latter. In fact, one could even say that Harley's painted surgical illustrations were intended to be not a guide for doctors performing medical procedures but for patients suffering them. As we have seen, the Harley authors employed multiple iconographic allusions to the passion of Christ in their representation of cautery patients. The manuscript offers a visual meditation on the nature of human suffering, which, if linked to the suffering of Christ and patiently endured, leads to physical healing and ultimately to spiritual redemption. While the surgical imagery of Harley 1585 focuses on individual suffering, the emphasis of both Hunter 100 and Pr\u00fcfening is on the healing of the monastic community as a whole. In the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript the cautery illustrations were part of a wider series of images that formed the idea of the monastic community as a body\u2014a sick, fallen body in need of a salvific cure. The depictions of diseased cautery patients contrasted with the image 239 of a perfected microcosmic man on the previous folio. The arrangement of the cautery illustrations not only mirrored the hierarchical schema of the microcosm but it also isolated certain ailments that were symbolic of moral disorders that were of particular concern to the Pr\u00fcfening community. By their nature, these ailments could not be suffered by the monastic body if it was to be Christ-like and achieve salvation. Similar to Pr\u00fcfening, the cautery images in Hunter 100 were part of a larger arrangement of materials in the manuscript that contrasted the perfection of the created universe with its condition after the fall. They also figuratively prescribed a specific remedy for this condition to the Durham monastic community, for the application of the cautery iron was shown to be symbolic of the application of monastic rule and discipline on the recently reformed community. Indeed, the surgical illustrations metaphorically represented those \"patients\" both willing and unwilling to accept such cure. Rather than serving as manuals for practical medicine, then, the surgical illustrations in the selected manuscripts could be understood to represent examples of practical theology. Medical Authorities The various images of doctors, medical helpers, authors, and ancient medical experts that are found throughout these manuscripts are also laden with theological references. Because they depict figures of authority it is inevitable that they sometimes have political overtones as well. This is especially evident in Hunter 100, for which it was argued that the depiction of a particular medical helper with a fiery hat may represent the (non-monastic) abbot of Durham, Ranulf Flambard, whose immoral life was incompatible with that of a Christian leader according to the standards of the Durham monks and the Rule of St. Benedict. Through a series of complex iconographical references, the Flambard figure is 240 shown to be a bearer of harm in the guise of one who comes to help. The figure also contrasts with other images of doctors and medical assistants in Hunter 100, whose representations make iconographical allusions to monastic discipline and the Rule. The image of authority presented in Hunter 100's depictions of doctors and their assistants thus resonates with the characteristics of the ideal abbot in the Rule of St. Benedict--and historically established in their communal ties to St. Cuthbert--who is to be both learned and in possession of a good will. True authority is expressed differently in Harley 1585. It is not bestowed on any of the doctors represented but rather on the ancient medical writer, Hippocrates, whose writings foreshadow Christian doctrine. The drawings of doctors and their helpers stand in stark contrast with the images of Hippocrates. While the ordinary doctors appear smaller, are plainly dressed, and bear an unassuming posture, Hippocrates, who appears twice, is depicted as enthroned and larger than life, and once is even juxtaposed with the divine. Seen in the context of Harley's larger theological concerns, Hippocrates's writings teach not only medical remedies but also point to spiritual cures that lead to salvation. Thus, the relationship between the doctor who enacts these cures and the authority of Hippocrates parallels that between the Christian leader\u2014the \"spiritual\" doctor\u2014and the ultimate authority of Christ. Finally, the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript elucidates the ideal of a Christian authority as a spiritual doctor by expanding upon notions of what it means to heal. Its depiction of twenty-two ancient authorities who perform cautery procedures are not all medical doctors but also philosophers, \"emperors,\" and other experts in non-medical fields. The implication is that the idea of health or cure is not limited to the physical body but applies to the mind and spirit as well, and that those who have mastered the intellectual and spiritual arts carry their own degree of healing authority. 241 While scholarly discussion of depictions of medical authorities has typically formed part of a narrative about the increasing professionalization of doctors and the legitimization of medical knowledge in the Middle Ages, this study has shown that such images go much deeper, raising questions about the nature and basis of authority in general, especially within a Christian context. Anatomical Illustrations Images depicting human anatomy are found in only one of the three manuscripts, that of Pr\u00fcfening. As the earliest surviving example of their type, the anatomical illustrations have accorded well with the renaissance narrative, demonstrating the return of ancient knowledge of the internal bodily systems to the Latin West. While this is certainly true, seen within their manuscript and institutional contexts, the anatomical drawings performed other roles and conveyed additional meanings that were not necessarily medical. The Pr\u00fcfening anatomical men should be seen as a counterpoint to the preceding microcosmic man, whose order, symmetry, and unity contrast strikingly with the former's awkward squatting position, disorderly arrangement, and multiplicity. Moreover, these were part of a larger group of images and texts that contributed to the construction of an ideal monastic \"body\" that the Pr\u00fcfening community wished to reflect. Once again, we find images whose original source was likely a medical context being redeployed for purposes that are contemplative and theological. Medical Images and the Intellectual Interests of Monks That monasteries would choose to depict ancient medical knowledge in their manuscripts is not surprising in itself. It must be seen as part of the monks' wide-ranging 242 intellectual pursuits that reached into all areas of learning, not just matters of religion. Monastic libraries were repositories of ancient knowledge and it is likely that the models for most twelfth-century medical illustrations originated in Late Antiquity, many of which may have been held by the largest European monasteries such as Fleury, St. Gall, and Monte Cassino. These were also the recipients (and in one case a center of translation) of some of the earliest copies of the Greco-Arabic medical texts being translated into Latin during the twelfth century. At least two of the monasteries studied here were in the process of building their collections and documented their intellectual ambitions. The Pr\u00fcfening manuscript, in addition to its depiction of the earliest surviving anatomical illustrations, also highlights the monastery's extensive inventory of books and the rapidity with which its library was accumulated. In Hunter 100, the monks of Durham chose to include some of the most recent scholarly materials on the computus, by the contemporary writer Robert of Hereford, and thereby displayed their intellectual interests as well as their connections to the scientific communities near Hereford.520 In addition, the vast array of images from different scientific traditions also exhibited the visual resources available to the monks.521 While the precise circumstances surrounding the third exemplar, Harley 1585, are less clear, the manuscript emerged from a community in the region around Li\u00e8ge, an important intellectual center at the 520 Faith Wallis, \"Albums of Science in Twelfth-Century England,\" Peritia 28 (2017): 195-224, 201-203. 521 A book inventory from only a few years after the creation of Hunter 100 names a number of the recent translations from the Arabic as part of the abbey's collection. The manuscripts include the Constantinian translations, the Pantegni, the Viaticum, and the Ysagoge. of the Library of Durham Cathedral, at Various Period, from the Conquest to the Dissolution, including Catalogues of the Library of the Abbey of Hulne and of the Mss. Preserved in the Library of Bishop Cosin at Durham (London, J.B. Nichols and Son, 1838), 6. 243 time, and it likely had access to medical materials originating from the monastery of Monte Cassino, a key disseminator of the new translations. It can be concluded that these manuscripts were intended less as practical manuals or pedagogical tools than as showcases of the monasteries' vast resources of knowledge, ancient and contemporary. They also served to establish the intellectual credentials of the community that created them. But these manuscripts were not merely encyclopedic. They also convey a peculiar form of learning, monastic meditatio, that distinguishes itself from the program practiced in the emerging universities. This was not a learning acquired by mastering definitions or complex formulas of logic. Instead it was based on associational thinking, forming relationships and connections across a wide range of texts and images, and ultimately connecting emergent themes to the interpreter's own experience.522 This was an arduous process. The complicated visual, textual, and structural relationships within each manuscript could only be mastered by long, sustained, deep reading and reflection. Hunter 100 speaks to the discipline, even suffering, involved in learning through its graphic image of a lazy student being beaten by his master, a suffering that is mirrored by the ordeal of the cautery patients depicted thereafter. Like these patients, however, whose suffering under a hot iron ultimately led to physical health, the monastic student under the rod of discipline might achieve a fully informed intellect that allowed him to perceive the truth about the world at hand. 522 See Mary Carruthers, The Craft of Thought: Meditation, Rhetoric, and the Making of Images, 400-1200 (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998); Anna C. Esmeijer, Divina Quaternitas: A Preliminary Study in the Method and Application of Visual Exegesis (Amsterdam: Van Gorcum, Abier, 1959-1964). 244 Medical Illustrations and Religious Interests of Monks However prominent knowledge and learning were to twelfth-century monasteries, the monks' intellectual endeavors were ultimately subordinate to their spiritual, theological, and religious interests. Monks not only gathered and copied Late Antique medical illustrations that were originally secular in nature, but they also transformed them into medieval Christian images that served their desire to know God and achieve salvation. In this respect, medical images served as vehicles for promoting a theological worldview and visualizing a soteriological goal. Depictions of surgery, anatomy, and medical authorities were linked by the monastic artists through a series of formal and iconographical choices to Christian ideas about the body, the Fall, sin, salvation, and cosmology. The fact that the human body was subject to sickness, injury, and death was understood by medieval Christians not as the natural state of things but as the result of the Fall, the original sin of Adam that led to his and his descendants' expulsion from the garden of Paradise. The body's frailty was thus ultimately a moral failing and only secondarily the result of physical processes. Medical treatments, whether they be medicines, surgeries, or other forms of therapy, were but stopgap measures that were powerless to prevent the body's final failure in death. A true and lasting remedy must overcome the Fall, or moral failing, and this would be in the form not of a physical cure but a spiritual one, a healing of the soul. Humanity, however, was incapable of providing this \"cure\" for itself. It must come from a divine source. The setting for this cure expanded from that of a doctor-patient relationship to a cosmological setting--of the recovery of the perfected body within a harmonious universe as originally created and as will be resurrected at the end of days to accompany the divine. All three exemplars construct a picture of a perfected, ideal universe\u2014the world as created by God, as it was intended to be\u2014that sets in relief the sick, \"fallen\" bodies of the 245 medical illustrations. In Hunter 100 this was achieved through the manuscript's division into two halves (each comprising of two independent booklets), the first filled with images and texts illustrating the harmony and order of the stars and planets; the second with images of human sickness and disorder. In Pr\u00fcfening, the perfect symmetry and arrangement of the microcosmic man with his Christ-like head, who is himself a mirror of the perfection of the larger universe, contrasts with the awkward, disordered bodies of the anatomical men and the cautery patients. In Harley 1585 we find an image of the creation event surrounded by a golden border and executed with a detail that sets it apart from all the other images in the work. Further, all three manuscripts construct their vision of the perfect, harmonious cosmos with ample references to the number four, considered in ancient thought to be a symbol of the natural balance and order of the world: references to the four humors, the four winds, the four seasons; selections of four texts; arrangements of columns, tables, and images into quadrants; or a book's division into four parts. Against this background of cosmic harmony, unity, and order, the depictions of surgery patients and anatomical men appear exaggeratedly discordant, divided, and disturbed. Their bodies lack the symmetry of the microcosmic man or the zodiac signs. They are often twisted and contorted, arranged into awkward, unnatural positions. In some cases, their suffering is obvious. The manifest reason for their appearance is bodily sickness, which theoretical texts placed within the manuscripts attribute to internal imbalance in the humours. Yet, as medieval doctrine identified, the exterior of the body also reflected the interior state of the soul.523 In the exemplar manuscripts, the conflation of sin and disease is never explicit, 523 Hugh of St. Victor, De institutione novitiorum, PL, vol. 176, 941C-D. See also Thomas E. A. Dale, \"Monsters, Corporeal Deformities, and Phantasms in the Cloister of St-Michel-de-Cuxa,\" The Art Bulletin 83, 3 (2001): 402-436, 407ff.; C. Stephen Jaeger, The Envy of Angels: Cathedral Schools 246 but there are strong iconographical connections between the portrayal of the surgical patients and contemporary depictions of the condemned at the Last Judgment or of various beasts and monsters that stood for sin; this is especially true in Harley 1585. In the Pr\u00fcfening manuscript the images of cautery patients and of anatomical men are followed by portrayals of personified virtues and vices, which, I have argued, represent a movement in the manuscript from depictions of external bodies (the microcosmic man, the cautery patients) to their interior states (anatomical men, virtues/vices). Not only do these manuscripts create iconographical links between physical disease and spiritual vice but they also parallel spiritual cure and the remedy of the cautery iron. This is most evident in Harley 1585 where the suffering of the cautery patients is linked in obvious ways to the iconography of Christ's Passion. In Hunter 100, the same suffering is connected to the discipline undertaken by monks and its spiritual goal of divine union. In Pr\u00fcfening, the expertise and painful techniques of the doctors are compared to those of the struggle and discipline of the virtues as prescribed by the spiritual authors. The notion of health thus became not only a regimen for proper physical functioning but also a conceptual template for achieving full body salvation. With salvation as its goal, other Christian conceptions of the \"body\" were metaphorically assumed into the paradigm of health. Christian doctrine teaches that one way to achieve the \"first fruits\" (cf. 1 Cor 15:20) of salvation was to participate in the larger community of the Church, conceived of as the Body of Christ. Two of the manuscripts studied here are overtly concerned with forming an ideal monastic body and preserving its health. The Congregation of Durham cathedral had recently been replaced by monks, and and Social Ideals in Medieval Europe, 950-1200 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, Raison des Gestes (Paris: Gallimard, 1990). 247 Hunter 100 suggests an image of the new community purged of its former vices and united as a single body under the Rule of St. Benedict. The manuscript is especially concerned with a sickness in the \"head\" of the community, which is to say its morally compromised, non-monastic abbot, and it offers a prescription for his conversion and thereby the monastic body's \"cure.\" Pr\u00fcfening, likewise, had recently been created under the Hirsauer reform and while flourishing under the long reign of Abbot Erbo, his death and subsequent changes in power led to the perceived need for the reinvigoration of the reformed community. The medical images (anatomy, cautery) were part of a larger series of illustrations intended to delineate an ideal monastic body and a regimen for its continued health. The initial microcosmic man is paralleled by a concluding depiction of the ideal community of the world to come and a model for the monks to imitate here on earth. The images were arranged so as to depict a movement from the original perfection of man in harmony with creation, through his Fall and division, his moral healing, and final restoration of unity in a perfected corporate body through which the monks could achieve salvation. Such theological and cosmological concepts are the key for fully appreciating the medical images set within these twelfth-century manuscripts and the conceptions of disease, cure, and health that they portray. Conclusion Twelfth-century notions of the \"body,\" \"disease,\" and \"cure\" were consonant with a wide range of other concepts beyond what we today consider strictly medical. The body was the vehicle to God, good health, and ultimate salvation, but also for evil, disease, and final condemnation. Seen as a whole, the medical illustrations in these manuscripts provide much more than practical medical information. They address medical theory, pedagogy, and 248 political issues; they take positions on major intellectual debates concerning the nature of the relationship between the body and soul and cosmological debates about the creation of the world. Above all, they are theological, forming a holistic picture of the body's fall through sin and its redemption through Christ, an image whose full meaning could only be grasped in the monastery through the arduous practice of contemplation. This dissertation has raised questions about what medicine was in the twelfth century and challenged long-held assumptions about the opposition between religious and scientific approaches to the body. If anything, this study has shown that within the monasteries of this period the boundaries between science and religion were blurred and inseparable. Concerns about the body and its health were not just medical but also spiritual and theological; inevitably, medieval Christianity--with its hope in bodily resurrection and eternal life--could not avoid questions of science and medicine. 249 Appendix A Closest Comparable Set of Cautery Procedures with Inscriptions and a Description of the Illustrations Munich, BSB, Clm 13002 (1165, Pr\u00fcfening) Milan, Ambrosiana, Codex Ambrosianus D 2 (late eleventh or early twelfth century, Italy or France)524 1 Folio 1v: Epilenticus iron and large tool (crutch?)

The inscriptions call for a flat cautery iron (lato cauterio). 528 Note that while the image only depicts two wide, flat marks on the patient's forehead, the inscription names additional sites on the throat. 255 Ambrosianus D 2 (3r), ad dolores cilio (for suffering of the eyelid)529 119v 5 Head: two wide, flat marks on the forehead; Chest: two circular marks at the collar bones; Lower torso: one circular mark on the patient's right side No comparisons 119v 6 Head: two wide, flat marks on the forehead; Chest/Neck: one circular mark in the center of the throat; Wrists: two circular marks on the inner wrists; Lower torso: one circular mark at the navel; Knees: two circular marks at the knees; Ankles/Feet: 2 circular marks on the ankles Ambrosianus 2v) geniculorum et pedum (headaches and swelling of the chest, hands, knees, and Pr\u00fcfening geniculorum et pedum (headaches and swelling of the chest, hands, and Gums: one circular mark between the lip and the chin Ambrosianus D 2, Pr\u00fcfening, Harley 1585, Laurenziana 73.41 and of the gums) 120r 8 Upper Torso: three circular marks across the upper chest; Mid-Torso: two circular marks on the breasts; Lower circular mark at the navel Pr\u00fcfening (fol. 2v) for a ruptured stomach and vulnus ruptum in Chirurgie, likens the disease of the eyelid to a migrane. 530 The inscription adds details on the appropriate tools. A round cautery iron was to be used for the head and a wide one (lato) for the rest of the body, which is opposite of what we see here. 531 The Pr\u00fcfening illustration is the closest match to Hunter 100. In Pr\u00fcfening, the text and image for this procedure both name and depict a wide iron for use on the head (capite) and a round one on the rest of the body 532 Note, however, that all marks on the Sloane patient are round whereas the Hunter 100 patient has flat, wide marks on his forehead. 533 The main difference between the Pr\u00fcfening and Hunter 100 patient is that instead of a single mark on the lower torso, the Pr\u00fcfening patient's lower torso shows four marks in the shape of a cross. 256 Appendix C Quire Review of the Hippocratic and a singleton currently attached to iii Quire i (6) Folio Contents Folio Contents 1r [Later writing] Inner edge has been attached to a newer parchment (folds have been replaced) dark parchment with holes (worm) and other disfiguration [possibly mold in the top half of the page throughout this quire] 6v End Table of Contents for De diversis herbis pen flourishes on the \"h\"erbam vetonicam Scolapius\" is very worn - hard to read Repair tape (?) in white covers one word 6r ToC De diversis herbis: Missing Books 89-114 (25 books = 1 folio; the scribe likely skipped a singleton in the original manuscript; 4 columns Inner edge has been attached to a newer parchment (folds have been replaced), as have the top 2 corners, dark parchment with holes (worm damage) and other disfiguration 2r ToC 4 columns Inner edge has been attached to a newer parchment (folds have been replaced), as have the top 2 corners dark parchment with holes (worm) and other disfiguration 5v ToC, 4 Columns Ends herbis 5r ToC, De diversis herbis; 4 Columns Inner edge has been attached to a newer parchment (folds have been replaced), as have the top left corner and slightly, the top right; dark parchment with holes (worm) and other disfiguration 3r ToC; 4 Columns Inner edge has been attached to a newer parchment (folds have been replaced), as have the top 2 corners; dark parchment with holes (worm) and other disfiguration 4v ToC; 4 Columns 3v ToC; 4 Columns 4r ToC; 4 Columns Inner edge has been attached to a newer parchment (folds have been replaced), as have the top 2 corners and the bottom right corner; dark parchment with holes (worm) and other disfiguration 257 Quire ii (6) Folio Contents Folio Contents 7r Four Humours; 2 Columns Inner edge has been attached to a newer parchment (folds have been replaced), dark parchment with holes (worm) and other disfiguration 12v Illustration: Depiction of God on Day 3 of Creation Prayer to the Earth Goddess in Golden script Single Column 7v Four Humours; 2 Columns (Half Page); Illustration: enthroned doctor and helper Note that the bottom edge of the plinth is painted with a line of light blue, but not the same vibrant blue used for the background on 8r 12r (pseudo) Hippocrates, Epistula ad Maecenatem; 2 Columns on the top half of the page; empty below 8r Illustration: 2 Cautery Procedures Inner edge has been attached to a newer parchment (folds have been replaced), dark parchment and other disfiguration.

Emperor 2r pain of the kidneys, one is burned this way: make one burn between the two shoulder blades, and two at the kidneys, properly observing them. The philosopher G[alen] discovered astronomy, music, geometry, arithmetic, and the art of medicine. 2r pain of the kidneys and hips, one is burned this way: make two burns on the kidneys, two from the opening above the bend of the knee, two [under kneecaps, which are stretched under the sole?], and if you wish, two under the joints of the feet. For pain of the toes, one is cut between two toes with a scalpel. Themison [wrote] two books of chronic disease (lit. slow 2r Ad tumores geniculorum For tumors of the knees or feet, [make] four burns on each inner side above and below the knee joint in this manner and above the joints of the feet. Emperor Antipater One suffering from sciatia is burned in this way: three wounds on the buttock that is afflicted, so that two be equal and the third under or even unequal the other on the tibia, or where the division of bone occurs in the hip, with a round cautery iron. Apollonius of Memphis who [is] himself de podagricis scripsit For a wound that breaks through the stomach and one who suffers from sickness of the heart, one burns in this way: make three equal burns on the chest and two under the breasts and four in the manner of a cross from each part of the stomach. Erasistratus wrote about people suffering from gout/podagra in Yrnia incenditur cauterio rotundo. Demetrius Hernia is burned in this way: the cautery iron wounds go around the sexual parts, one in one part and one in the other with 266 appaneus in iron. In a book of signs, Demetrius Appaneus says namely that a certain old man endured so much stretching of the male sexual organs that it was considered a [bow/horn?]. 2v Elefantiosus incenditur elephantiasis is burned in this way: one wound on one vein of the neck and one in the other, four under the chest in the little cavity of the anima in the manner of a cross, three in one hip and three in the other, and two under the joints of the feet with a round cautery iron. Zenophon is the most worthy of doctors. 2v Podagricus incenditur sic. One suffering from gout of the foot is burned in this way. 267 Appendix F Transcription and Translation of the Pr\u00fcfening Anatomical Men Text (fols. 2v-3r)534 Transcription In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Here begins an account of [surgical] cutting as the most experienced of doctors, G[alen] says, vein following vein, bone following bone, muscle following muscle, and nerve following nerve. He describes them according to what they are and separates one from the other so that the viewer might not err, but instead recognize them as he sees them. First is a description [of the arteries]; second, the veins; third, the position of the bones; fourth, the nerves; fifth, the muscles; sixth, the genitals; seventh, the stomach, liver and belly; eighth, of the womb; ninth, of the brain and eye Arteries In in cerebrum et the first description the arteries are considered, which come through the veins of the liver [divided] into two parts, which ascend to the diaphragm and come to the chest and ascend from the chest to the neck. [This is] an account of the arteries that do not pulsate. One of them is poured out into the vertebrae of the neck and thence is led to the face, until it reaches the right temple where it is collected and waters [the right temple] just as its colleague waters the left. The corresponding stream flows through the neck into the chin and comes into the gargaleon, the head, and the brain and is one of the nourishing 534 I used Boyd H. Hill's translation of a composite anatomical text as the basis for my translation. See Hill, \"The Funfbilderserie and Medieval Anatomy,\" 200-206. 535 The manuscript apparent hic et nutriunt cerebrum veins. And from it proceeds a branch which appears on the outside of the throat; it goes back to nourish the brain. Another vein of the liver encircles the top of the shoulder. From it proceeds another large vein, which descends to the heart and all the way to the left side of the [diaphragm] and equally takes care of both the left and the right sides. In the same way, another branch proceeds from that vein, where it emerges from the liver, and it goes in parts of the liver and the stomach and joins with its partner above the intestine all the way downward and meets up with the hip veins; from there it reaches the sole of the foot and thus through the whole structure of the foot by which they nourish the brain they appear here and nourish the brain536 Veins et apparent in facie et colligantur ex omni parte utrumque venae This is an account of the arteries, which proceed from the heart. And these are the veins which pulsate and again, there proceed from there two large veins and their source is from a black seed in the heart, in which the spirit resides. And from there proceeds a large vein, which divides in two parts, the right and the left, and from that very vein proceed throughout the body all the veins which pulsate. And again, from there go out two large veins, which ascend to the throat and reach the throat and the palate and appear in the face and are joined from every part above each temple and through all the forehead, and again they ascend to the brain and intertwine themselves over it like a net; this net, which protects and guides the brain, is 536 The last part of the sentence, \"they appear here and nourish the brain,\" is likely a misread caption. Hill, \"The Funfbilderserie ramos ex quibus alii called anaphusa. Likewise two other veins, fine ones, appear just like the first ones and ascend to the face and eyes. The above-mentioned veins are peculiar to the head. And again the arteries proceed throughout the breast from each side: and from them certain ones ascend from the shoulders and they have branches, from which others are formed, one over the other; among them the vein of the brain makes its appearance and descends through that very one [the brain], until it joins its partner, which comes out of the heart into the arteries and they are diverted into the hand; from the middle of them, arteries with branches run into the parts of the chest and hands. And the veins descend in a straight line downwards over the chest, the liver, the spleen, and in the intestines from each side all the way to the heels, according to the account Bones est ibi aliud These are accounts of the bones separated one from the other as their maker and creator arranged them; the nerves and the flesh cover them, and the nerves bind one to the another. The beginning of these bones is the helmet: it is rounded in shape and the brain rests under it. Through these, a bone in the inmost part [of the brain] runs down into the neck vertebrae, which are joined in turn with that [helmet bone?] and with the beard bone; from there the tears fall down, and the muscles of those are called joy; on the outside are tiny bones like sesame seeds. The nose originates in bone that is in the middle of the eyes and is cartilaginous. The cheeks and the jaws and their borders join the root bone of the ears, and are called shields; in these bones are the teeth, the number of which is thirty-two. sinistra est minus costa una in masculo et in femina sunt complete Reliqua sunt hystoriae The bones of the throat are [also those of] the upper vertebrae and there is another bone there that sweats, and again ninety bones of the eyes are placed in the face for the face537 and there are seven and from them are made the ribs. Indeed, the ribs of the right side are complete; on the left side there is one rib less in the male, and in women there is a complete set. The remaining are accounts...[missing text?] Nerves uni oculo et This is the account of the nerves, which are the connecting bands of the body, the bones, the veins, and the muscles, and they are in the body as the Lord most wisely formed and fashioned them. At the start two large nerves go through the marrow of the vertebrae, which are to the rear, and they envelop those with their colleague and bind them together and hold them [until] they reach the nape of the neck; and from there the tops of those nerves from each side ascend over the head and are collected there in two round nodes539; one nerve proceeds from the brain and descends to the anterior part of the head and to the forehead, where it appears, and divides in two; these are joined mid-way ad faciem (and again ninety bones of the eyes are placed in the face for the face) is likely a transposed line. 538 It is likely that a word has been omitted here or mis-transcribed. I have translated ad nec as dum (until). 539 The manuscript reads modis, but I have translated it as nodis. 271 alter ad ambas palmas feet in other texts] secundum quod vides. the eyes, and again divided each one ministers light to one eye; this nerve is called the [--ris] and is perforated. Two large nerves descend into the jaws and from there return to the upper nerve of the head; and a nerve proceeds to the head, which is equal to the first and descends into the breast and is joined at that place and is diverted as far as it goes; and the third equal [to the other two] descends internally from each side all the way to both palms, which you see following. Muscles Haec est historia adiuvant ea in omni motione sua This is the story of the muscles, which the Lord made in order that the void be filled up and what is separate is joined together; there are three kinds: one is flesh; another is neither flesh nor sustenance but something in between; the third is unlike the first and the second and is called muscle, and by means of it the body can be moved and can turn at will. Their origin is in the jaws and they help the mouth and lips to open and in every motion of the mouth they become thick. There are two equal muscles which help the mouth open and swallow, and they put the spiritus in place and keep it there. Two of these [muscles] are under the arteries of the throat and support the nape of the neck in all of its motions, and those which are in the chest are round on the bottom and pointed on top; they are joined alternately and are connected in either side of the nape of the neck. Those which are in the belly and border on those which are in the chest are helpful in the digestion and voiding of food, and they support in raising and lowering....540 Those which are in 540 Other anatomical texts specifically name the penis (virgam) as being raised and lowered by these muscles. The Pr\u00fcfening monks maintained the verbs to raise (erigendo) and lower 272 the hands help them in their every motion, and those which are in the hips and legs and ankle support them in every motion. (declinando) but left out the reference to the male sexual organ. See Hill, \"The Funfbilderserie and Medieval Anatomy,\" 48. 273 Appendix G: Transcription and Translation of the month reponticus. For the month of February [take] agrimonia and celery seed. For the month of March [take] ruta and lebusticus. For the month of April [take] betony and bibinella. For the month of May [take] absinthe and fennel seed. For the month of June [take] salvia flowers and savina. For the month of July [take] celery and grape flowers.

For the month of November [take] cinnamon. For the month of of May [take] gamandrea to subdue the humours. For the month of June [take] celery [seed?] and pepper under the tongue, about a spoonful, to bind the bowels or to loosen them. For the month of July [take] cardonis with five grains of pepper. For the month of August [use] salvia with pepper to season food. For the month of September [take] betony with pepper. For the month of October [take] savina with salt. For the months of November and December [take] hyssop and satureia for the For the months of January and February [take] sarmina with salt. For the month of March [take] fleabane (puleium) to warm the stomach. In the month of April, let he who is fasting delay drinking each day. Afterwards, that same year, let him not fear to fall [ill] with the month of March drink fleabane. Sweet foods and roots should be consumed. Aspario, used habitually, does not lessen the blood nor weaken [the body] because this very solution generates cold. For the month of April, to lessen the blood and to relax do not eat fresh meat. To lessen the blood under the skin use heat; To purge the stomach, use a calasticum of rubbed oil. If 274 you do thus, then all the parts of the body will be restored to For the month of May, one should drink something warmed. Used regularly, a warmed beverage purges the head, for a warmed drink is placed in the heat of the vital organs. One may cut the vein of the head and drink a solution [for] the liver vein, to eliminate an itch, to purify the urine, and to make the food cold. For the month of June, he who is fasting should drink a cup of ale daily, not diluted wine. Let him eat lettuces and let him drink warm beverages. For the month of July... 275 Bibliography Primary Sources Al ibn al-Abbs Majs, Constantine (the African). Chirurgia: Pantegni, pars II, liber Ministero Difesa-Marina, Ambrose. Hexameron.
