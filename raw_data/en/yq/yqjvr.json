Key words: mindfulness, meditation, mind/body medicine, mindfulness-based stress comment on Baer's (2003; this issue) review of mindfulness training as clinical inter-vention and to add my own re flections on the emergence of mindfulness in a clinical context, especially in a journalexplicitly devoted to both science and practice. The uni-verse of mindfulness 1brings with it a whole new meaning and thrust to the word practice, one which I believe has the potential to contribute profoundly to the further develop-ment of the eld of clinical psychology and its allied disci- plines, behavioral medicine, psychosomatic medicine, andhealth psychology, through both a broadening of researchapproaches to mind/body interactions and the develop-ment of new classes of clinical interventions. THE GROWING INTEREST IN MINDFULNESS I nd the Baer review to be evenhanded, cogent, and per- ceptive in its description and evaluation of the work thathas been published through the middle of 2001, work thatfeatures mindfulness training as the primary element invarious clinical interventions. It complements nicely therecent review by Bishop (2002), which to my mind ignoressome of the most important, if di cult to de ne, features of such interventions in its emphasis on the perceived needto reduce to a clinical algorithm the complexity of the practice and nuanced delivery of mindfulness-based stressreduction (MBSR). Both Baer and Bishop pose important questions that re- quire addressing if researchers and clinicians are ultimatelyto understand mindfulness and its clinical utility. Both re-views agree that the scienti c study of mindfulness and MBSR to date su ers from a range of methodological problems, a view with which I concur. When a eld is in its infancy, it is not uncommon for the rst generation of studies to be more descriptive of the phenomenon ratherthan denitive demonstrations of e cacy. Attempts at the latter tend to evolve over time after the potential value ofa new approach has been at least tentatively established.This now appears to be the case with mindfulness-basedinterventions. Both Baer and Bishop conclude that enoughevidence has now accumulated to warrant the develop-ment of more methodologically rigorous investigations ofboth the clinical e cacy of mindfulness training in various specic disorders and the possible mechanisms and path- ways through which it might exert characteristic e ects within those speci c disorders. The very fact that an increasing number of studies on mindfulness and its clinical applications are being fundedand published and that an increasing number of doctoraltheses on mindfulness are appearing in Dissertation Ab-stracts suggests that this is an area that is currently sparkingconsiderable interest, perhaps driven primarily by the in-tuition that new dimensions of therapeutic bene t and novel insights into mind/body interactions might accruethrough its exploration. Because interest in mindfulnessand its applications to speci c aective conditions is likely to increase even further, particularly within the cognitivetherapy community with the development of mindful-ness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; Segal, Williams, &T easdale, 2002) and with the use of mindfulness withindilectical behavior therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993), it be-comes critically important that those persons coming tothe eld with professional interest and enthusiasm recog- nize the unique qualities and characteristics of mindful-ness as a meditative practice, with all that implies, so thatmindfulness is not simply seized upon as the next prom-ising cognitive behavioral technique or exercise, decon-textualized, and \"plugged\" into a behaviorist paradigmwith the aim of driving desirable change, or of xing what is broken.WHAT EXACTL Y IS MINDFULNESS, AND WHERE DOES IT COME FROM? As pointed out by Baer, mindfulness has to do with par- ticular qualities of attention and awareness that can be cul-tivated and developed through meditation. An operationalworking de nition of mindfulness is: the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the pres-ent moment, and nonjudgmentally to the unfolding ofexperience moment by moment. Historically, mindfulnesshas been called \"the heart\" of Buddhist meditation (Thera,1962). It resides at the core of the teachings of the Buddha(Gunaratana, 1992;Hanh, 1999;Nanamoli & Bodhi, 1995),traditionally described by the Sanskrit word dharma, which carries the meaning of lawfulness as in \"the laws of physics\" or simply \"the way things are,\" as in the Chinese notion ofTao.One might think of the historical Buddha as, among other things, a born scientist and physician who had noth-ing in the way of instrumentation other than his ownmind and body and experience, yet managed to use thesenative resources to great e ect to delve into the nature of suering and the human condition. What emerged from this arduous and single-minded contemplative investiga-tion was a series of profound insights, a comprehensiveview of human nature, and a formal \"medicine\" for treat-ing its fundamental \"dis-ease,\" typically characterized as thethree \"poisons\": greed, hatred (aversion), and ignorance/delusion (unawareness). Of course, the Buddha himself was not a Buddhist. One might think of dharma as a sort of universal generativegrammar (Chomsky, 1965), an innate set of empiricallytestable rules that govern and describe the generation ofthe inward, rst-person experiences of su ering and hap- piness in human beings. In that sense, dharma is at its coretruly universal, not exclusively Buddhist. It is neither a be-lief, an ideology, nor a philosophy. Rather, it is a coherentphenomenological description of the nature of mind,emotion, and su ering and its potential release, based on highly re ned practices aimed at systematically training and cultivating various aspects of mind and heart via thefaculty of mindful attention (the words for mind and heartare the same in Asian languages; thus \"mindfulness\" in-cludes an a ectionate, compassionate quality within the attending, a sense of openhearted, friendly presence andinterest). And mindfulness, it should also be noted, beingabout attention, is also of necessity universal. There isnothing particularly Buddhist about it. We are all mindful COMMENTARIES ON BAER 145to one degree or another, moment by moment. It is an in- herent human capacity. The contribution of the Buddhisttraditions has been in part to emphasize simple and e ec- tive ways to cultivate and re ne this capacity and bring it to all aspects of life. In this regard, mindfulness certainly re-ceived its most explicit and systematic articulation anddevelopment within the Buddhist tradition over the past2,500 years, although its essence lies at the heart of otherancient and contemporary traditions and teachings as well,approaches that can be of great value in re ning one's own practice, insight, and teaching (see, for is the fundamental attentional stance underlying all streams of Buddhist meditative practice:theTheravada tradition of the countries of Southeast Asia(Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, and Vietnam); the Maha-yana (Zen) schools of Vietnam, China, Japan, and Korea;and the Vajrayana tradition of Tibetan Buddhism found inTibet itself, Mongolia, Nepal, Bhutan, Ladakh, and nowlarge parts of India in the Tibetan community in exile. Itshould be noted that these traditions all have variousschools, subtraditions, and particular texts that they reveremore than others, so the actual practices and emphases re-garding mindfulness can vary considerably, even withinone tradition, such as Theravada or Zen (Goldstein, 2002).Nevertheless, mindfulness, as elucidated by the Buddha intwo discourses, the Anapanasati Sutra (Rosenberg, 1999)and the Satipathana Sutra (Thera, 1962), is the core teach-ing and constitutes the foundation upon which all of thesevarious forms and traditions rest. In these traditions theactual practice of mindfulness is, however, always nestedwithin a larger conceptual and practice-based ethicalframework oriented towards nonharming (an orientationit shares with the Hippocratic tradition of Western medi-cine). This \"view\" includes a skillful understanding of howunexamined behaviors and what Buddhists would call anuntrained mind can signi cantly contribute directly to hu- man su ering, one's own and that of others. It also includes the potential transmutation of that su ering through med- itative practices that calm and clarify the mind, open theheart, and re ne attention and action. Over the past 40 years or so all of these Buddhist tradi- tions have taken root in the West to one degree or another(Bachelor, 1994;Fields, 1992), and have by this time beentaken up by several generations of Westerners, who prac-tice these methods in their own lives on a daily basis as wellas through participation in periodic teacher-led, intensivemeditation retreats, which can last from a weekend to 3months or more (see, for example, Goldstein, 1987;Gold-stein, 2002; Goldstein & Korn eld, 1987; Walsh, 1977, 1978). This phenomenon represents a cultural shift thatmay be only in its infancy. Nevertheless, it provides a rangeof rich resources for personal practice and dialogue that cancontribute toward the training and development of a co-hort of highly competent teachers, from a wide variety ofprofessional backgrounds, committed to the e ective de- livery of authentic mindfulness-based interventions in var-ious settings. Mindfulness is often spoken of synonymously as \"in- sight\" meditation, which means a deep, penetrative non-conceptual seeing into the nature of mind and world. Thisseeing requires a spirit of perpetual and persistent in-quiry\u2014as in, \"What is this?\"\u2014toward whatever arises \"who is see-ing,\" \"who is meditating.\" Its role in deep inquiry and thecultivation of insight have led some to argue that thatmindfulness provides a unique perspective that can informcritical issues in cognitive science, neurophenomenology,and attempts to understand the cognitive underpinningsof the nature of human experience itself (Varela, Thomp-son, & Roach, 1991). CROSS-CUL TURAL AND PARADIGM ISSUES IN WORKING WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS DISCIPLINES From the perspective of the behavioral sciences, mindful- ness can be thought of as a \"consciousness discipline,\" as de-scribed by Walsh in a seminal paper (Walsh, 1980) thatexplicates the generic paradigm of the meditative traditionsand their associated disciplines and shows how such disci-plines might be approached empirically by the behavioralsciences without falling into paradigm clash or a range ofcategory errors, which can unwittingly ignore or dismissthe deepest and most subtle features of such practices,thereby predisposing investigators to draw erroneous con-clusions. Thus, in encountering the consciousness disci-plines and the question of their possible adaptation andapplication in secular clinical or medical contexts, it iscritically important to treat mindfulness and the traditionsthat have articulated it much as a respectful anthropolo-gist would treat an encounter with an indigenous culture(Davis, 1998) or a di erent epistemology (Zajonc, 2000). This intimate sensitivity will be necessary to understand,evaluate, and preserve essential elements of the universal CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY: SCIENCE AND PRACTICE V10 N2, SUMMER 2003 146dharma dimension of mindfulness practice as it is analyzed by and incorporated into Western science. It in no waycontradicts the call by Hayes (2002) to nd ways to t practices and knowledge from spiritual traditions into thetheoretical matrix of scienti c psychology. The challenge is to nd a t that honors the integrity of what may be dif- ferent but complementary epistemologies. It should be noted in this regard that, in the cross- cultural context of scienti c studies of Tibetan monks practicing meditation, sensitivity to di erences in orien- tation and motivation between neuroscientists and medi-tators around both the meditation practices and the set and setting in which they are investigated is essential for the investigation to have integrity and to be interpretableand valid from the perspective of both the scientists and the meditators (Houshmound, Harrington, Saron, &Davidson, 2002). In a recent \"cross-cultural\" develop-ment of note, EEG, fMRI, and PET studies of brain ac-tivity in the evocation of speci c meditative states and positive feelings, such as compassion and devotion, in ahighly trained long-term monastic practitioner (a WesternLama in the Tibetan tradition with a doctorate in molec-ular biology) have engaged the meditator not merely assubject but as a full collaborator in the design and interpre-tation of these investigations with his scienti c counter- parts, capitalizing as well on his highly developed ability to give a precise account of his mental activity during var-ious practices. These investigations show a range of stablepatterns of brain activity (\"neural signatures of di erent mental states\") that have never been observed in naive sub-jects, patterns that can be replicated by the subject at will,depending on his choice of meditative practice. Such stud-ies have multiple implications for research in a ective neu- roscience, neuroplasticity, and our understanding of whatmight be possible through speci c kinds of training re- garding the ways we process and express emotion (Gole-man, 2003). They assume practical relevance in light ofbrain changes re flecting enduring shifts in the processing of negative emotion under stress, which have been observedin novice meditators following training in MBSR Kabat-Zinn, Schu-macher, Rosenkranz, Santorelli, et al., in press). THE MEANING OF \"PRACTICE\" IN THE CONTEXT OF MINDFULNESS MEDITATION If we hope to understand mindfulness meditation, it be- hooves us to examine the use of the word practice and itsmeaning as it refers to the meditative traditions and theconsciousness disciplines that form their core. We speak ofthe \"practice\" of meditation, and the \"practice\" of mind-fulness, meaning the actual engagement in the discipline,the inward gesture that invites and embodies it (Depraz,Varela, & Vermersch, 2000). It is not used in the commonsense of \"rehearsal\" for some future performance. The\"performance\" is always this moment unfolding (Kabat-Zinn, 1994). This engagement takes a variety of forms,from a range of formal practices that are undertaken forvarying periods of time on a regular basis, to informal prac-tices that are aimed at cultivating a continuity of awarenessin all activities of daily living. However, mindfulness med-itation practice, whether within the various Buddhist tra-ditions or within the context of MBSR, for instance, is notlimited to the operationalization of particular techniques,which, however important and essential, which they are,are also merely launching platforms or particular kindsof sca olding to invite cultivation and sustaining of atten- tion in particular ways. They are the menu, so to speak, notthe meal;the map, rather than the territory, the traditionaladmonition being not to mistake the nger pointing at the moon for the moon. In a recent commentary in this journal on the subject of mindfulness and generalized anxiety disorder, Borkovec(2002) describes in whimsical but cogent and insightfuldetail the emotional consequences of living with a trustthat, he says, \"allows me to let go of the illusory future andpast and to focus on the nonillusory present.\" Using ex-amples of washing the dishes and of writing a NationalInstitute of Mental Health (NIMH) grant, he unpacksvarious cognitive sets that either create anxiety about futureoutcomes, or keep him grounded in the process itself (thepresent moment) and its intrinsic meaning and pleasures.He states, If a focus on the outcome and the extrinsic aspects of an activity are conducive to anxiety and depression, then the objective qual-ity of my work, whether washing dishes or writing grant propos-als, will likely be lowered, given what we know about the adverseeects of negative emotion on performance. So seeking the extrin- sic outcome makes the failure to achieve that outcome more likely.A focus on the process and intrinsic qualities of an activity reducesthe likelihood of anxiety and depression (thus eliminating theirnegative impact on performance), increases the pleasure of joyduring the process, and thus increases the likelihood of achiev-ing the extrinsic outcome. I have to let go of the desired outcome COMMENTARIES ON BAER 147in order to acquire it. What a paradoxical and strange way to live. (pp. 79-80) I would add only that it is perhaps a sane way to live that may not be so strange once one begins to inhabit that land-scape in a more regular way. Perhaps it is only strange in asociety that persists in devaluating the present moment infavor of perpetual distraction, self-absorption, and addic-tion to a feeling of \"progress.\" Although Borkovec's de-scriptions of his inner process are compelling, it is unlikelythat such process would be sustained or developed overtime in most of us without some element of intentionalpractice (it is not enough as a rule to remind oneself to \"justlet go,\" especially when one is little aware of how attachedone may be and, also, how blind to being caught up in ha-bitual patterns of thinking and emotional expression). It ishere that the cultivation of the inner orientation of whichBorkovec speaks is so important. Mindfulness is not merelya good idea such that, upon hearing about it, one can im-mediately decide to live in the present moment, with thepromise of reduced anxiety and depression and heightenedperformance and life satisfaction, and then instantly and re-liably realize that state of being. Rather, it is more akin toan art form that one develops over time, and it is greatlyenhanced through regular disciplined practice, both for-mally and informally, on a daily basis. This challenge we pose to our patients in the Stress Re- duction Clinic at the very beginning, and with the intro-duction of the body scan meditation, or even the processof eating one raisin mindfully:namely, to let go of their ex-pectations, goals, and aspirations for coming, even thoughthey are very real and valid, to let go\u2014momentarily, atleast\u2014even of their goal to feel better or to be relaxed inthe body scan, or of their ideas about what raisins tastelike, and to simply \"drop in\" on the actuality of their livedexperience and then to sustain it as best they can momentby moment, with intentional openhearted presence andsuspension of judgment and distraction, to whatever de-gree possible. Mindfulness develops and deepens over timebut invariably requires an ongoing commitment to its prac-tice and cultivation in any and every moment. PRACTICE WITHOUT ATTACHMENT TO OUTCOME In fact, the term \"practice\" used in this way is better under-stood as a way of being, a way of seeing, which is embod-ied, inhabited, grown into through the implementation ofthe methods and techniques that comprise the discipline(Kabat-Zinn, 2003). There is a major role for paradox here,so Borkovec's noting of it is quite relevant. Indeed, paradoxis built in, since the ultimate understanding one encoun-ters through paying attention transcends even conventionalsubject-object duality. From the outset of practice we arereminded that mindfulness is not about getting anywhereelse or xing anything. Rather, it is an invitation to allow oneself to be where one already is and to know the in-ner and outer landscape of the direct experience in eachmoment. This implies waking up to the full spectrum ofour experience in the present moment, which, as we en-gage in mindfulness practice, we rapidly discover is se-verely edited and often distorted through the routinized,habitual, and unexamined activity of our thoughts andemotions, often involving signi cant alienation from direct experience of the sensory world and the body. In my experience, an understanding of these consider- ations is critical, both to the development of clinical inter-ventions that authentically nurture mindfulness and speakwith compelling, sustained relevance to the lives and needsof potential participants, and to the scienti c paradigm for its study. This emphasis on nonattachment to outcomeis a radical departure from most clinical interventions. Y etit can be found at the heart of Jacobson's pioneering work(1938), which emphasized learning to recognize and trustthe direct proprioceptive experience of the landscape ofsensation within tension rather than striving to achieve amore desirable state, such as relaxation. It was only whenhis method was condensed into progressive muscle relax-ation (PMR) in the service of systematic desensitization(Wolpe, 1958) that the nonstriving, slow, mindful elementwas, ironically, abandoned\u2014probably unwittingly\u2014in fa-vor of time e ciency and, with it, the primacy of the ex- periencing of the sensations themselves, without judgmentor editing (see Woolfolk & Lehrer, 1984). ORIGINAL VISION AND RATIONALE FOR MBSR The intention in developing MBSR in 1979 and o ering it through an outpatient stress reduction clinic at the Uni-versity of Massachusetts Medical Center was twofold, asexplained below. MBSR as a training vehicle for the relief of su ering. The primary intention was to see if it were possible to create avehicle for the e ective training of medical patients in rel- CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY: SCIENCE AND PRACTICE V10 N2, SUMMER 2003 148atively intensive mindfulness meditation (including mind- ful hatha yoga) and its immediate applications to the stress,pain, and illness people were grappling with in their lives.The intervention needed to be free of the cultural, reli-gious, and ideological factors associated with the Buddhistorigins of mindfulness, because the objective was not toteach Buddhism or even \"to make great meditators\" outof people, but to o er an environment within which to experiment with a range of novel and potentially e ective methods for facing, exploring, and relieving su ering at the levels of both body and mind, and understanding thepotential power inherent in the mind/body connectionitself in doing so. At the same time, the program neededto remain faithful in both spirit and substance to the uni-versal dharma dimension alluded to, which, as noted, liesat the very core of the gesture of mindfulness. The task,which is always ongoing and immediate for the MBSRinstructor, is to translate the meditative challenges and con-text into a vernacular idiom, vocabulary, methods, andforms which are relevant and compelling in the lives of theparticipants, yet without denaturing the dharma dimen-sion. This requires some degree of understanding of thatdimension, which can come about only through exposureand personal engagement in practice\u2014learned or deep-ened either though meditation retreats at Buddhist centersor through professional training programs in MBSR withteachers who have themselves trained in that way, or,ideally, both. 2The Stress Reduction Clinic requires exten- sive grounding in mindfulness practice as one criterion inhiring new teachers. The standards we employ are outlinedin a series of recommendations for assessing teaching read-iness and competency in MBSR instructors in general(Santorelli, 2001). The Stress Reduction Clinic, embedded within a de- partment of medicine and a division of preventive and be-havioral medicine, was originally designed to serve as areferral service for physicians and other health providers, towhich they could send medical patients with a wide rangeof diagnoses and conditions who were not respondingcompletely to more traditional treatments, or who were\"falling through the cracks\" in the health care system alto-gether and not feeling satis ed with their medical treat- ments and outcomes. MBSR was thus framed from thebeginning as a generic challenge to each patient to train inancient and potentially transformative meditative practicesas a complement to his or her medical treatments (Kabat-Zinn, 1993). The clinic, in the form of an 8-week course for outpatients, was meant to serve as an educational (in thesense of inviting what is already present to come forth) ve-hicle through which people could assume a degree of re-sponsibility for their own well-being and participate morefully in their own unique movement towards greater lev-els of health by cultivating and re ning our innate capac- ity for paying attention and for a deep, penetrative seeing/sensing of the interconnectedness of apparently separateaspects of experience, many of which tend to hover be-neath our ordinary level of awareness regarding both innerand outer experience (Kabat-Zinn, 1990;Santorelli, 1999). MBSR as a model. If the experience was \"successful\" in terms of acceptability of the process to the participants andthe referring physicians, and in terms of attaining measur-able outcomes of clinical signi cance, the second intention in developing MBSR was that the program might serveas a model for other hospitals and medical centers, whichindeed has proved to be the case, and would be adaptableto other contexts in which stress, emotional and physicalpain, or illness and disease were primary concerns. T o thisend, the clinic eventually developed a range of professionaltraining programs in MBSR. 3Mindfulness-based pro- grams are now o ered in hospitals and clinics around the world, as well as in schools, workplaces, corporate o ces, law schools, adult and juvenile prisons, inner city healthcenters, and a range of other settings. SOME CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH TEACHING MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS It should be clear from what has been said that mindful- ness, from our point of view, cannot be taught to othersin an authentic way without the instructor's practicing itin his or her own life. Mindfulness meditation is notsimply a method that one encounters for a brief time at aprofessional seminar and then passes on to others for useas needed when they nd themselves tense or stressed. It is a way of being that takes ongoing e ort to develop and rene, in T. S. Eliot's apt phrase, \" A condition of complete simplicity / (Costing not less than everything)\" (Eliot,1943). It is both the work of a lifetime and, paradoxically,the work of no time at all\u2014because its eld is always this present moment in its fullness. This paradox can be un-derstood and embodied only through sustained personalpractice over days, weeks, months, and years. COMMENTARIES ON BAER 149Recall that practice as we have been using the word is not a mechanical self-repetition of meditation instruc-tions (although it can sometimes subtly feel that way), buta commitment to reside as best one can from moment tomoment in awareness with an open heart, a spacious, non-judging, nonreactive mind, and without trying to get any-where, achieve anything, reject anything, or fall into eitherthe stream of conceptual thought or what the Dalai Lamacalls \"a ictive\" or \"unwholesome\" emotions (Goleman, 1997, 2003). Since it is virtually inevitable that peoplewill fall into both the stream of conceptual thought and af-flictive emotions (and potentially unwise actions) over and over again, the practice involves working intimately andcompassionately with whatever arises in the eld of aware- ness, so that whatever arises is seen and known (recognized)in the eld of awareness as it arises (or as soon as one can). Thus, mindfulness can always be large enough to includewhatever arises if it can be seen, felt, and known noncon-ceptually, directly apprehended through the ve senses (including proprioception) and through the mind, whichin Buddhism is considered another sense door. However,it takes personal commitment and perseverance in formalpractice gradually to establish a degree of stability in one'scapacity to attend, especially to stressful or aversive objects,including severe emotional turbulence or enduring dys-phoria, and to see beneath the surface of the phenomenathemselves as they arise in the eld of experience. Classes and periodic retreats form a supportive group environmentwithin which practice can develop and deepen over timefor both teachers and students of mindfulness. A workingprinciple for MBSR teachers is that we never ask more ofour patients in terms of practice than we ask of ourselveson a daily basis. Another is that we are all students and thelearning and growing are a lifelong engagement. The decision to teach mindfulness, even among those teachers with many years of personal meditation practice,whether they be trained as psychologists, physicians, sur-geons, or other health professionals, can at times be intim-idating and humbling, and understandably so. One needsto be well prepared to take on such a challenge, and thatusually includes feeling that one is nowhere near ready tobegin teaching. In our experience, unless the instructor'srelationship to mindfulness is grounded in extensive per-sonal practice, the teaching and guidance one might bringto the clinical context will have little in the way of appro-priate energy, authenticity, or ultimate relevance, and thatdecit will soon be felt by program participants. For howcan one ask someone else to look deeply into his or her own mind and body and the nature of who he or she is ina systematic and disciplined way if one is unwilling (or toobusy or not interested enough) to engage in this great andchallenging adventure oneself, at least to the degree thatone is asking it of one's patients or clients? How will oneknow how to respond appropriately and speci cally to their questions if one cannot draw on one's own lived ex-perience, not just on book knowledge and concepts, whenthe practice itself is all about seeing clearly and transcend-ing (not getting caught up in and blinded by) the limita-tions of the conceptual mind while, of course, not rejectingthe conceptual mind or the power and utility of thoughtwithin the larger context of awareness? Since people with stress, pain, and medical conditions of all sorts invariably and quite naturally come to stress reduc-tion or to various forms of therapy with agendas and goals(and, in fact, are encouraged to de ne realistic goals for themselves in MBSR), how will a teacher skillfully recon-cile their motivation to achieve these perfectly sensible goalswith the orientation of nonstriving, nondoing, and lettinggo that must inform the meditation practice and the en-tire program if it is to be mindfulness? It can be done onlyif one feels a deep experience-based con dence in the prac- tice and an equally deep humility in o ering it to others, developed through one's own intimate engagement andstruggles with it. Ultimately, one teaches out of one's ownpassion for the practice itself, keeping things grounded inthe actuality of present-moment experience. Of course, askillful teacher will bring in any number of things as appro-priate to inform and round out the teaching, dialogue, andpractice itself, drawing on his or her extensive professionaland personal knowledge base, temperament, and skills.However, without the foundation of personal practice andthe embodying (a preferable term to \"modeling,\" whichcarries the unfortunate connotation of intentionally actingin a particular way for the sake of appearances) of what it isone is teaching, attempts at mindfulness-based interven-tion run the risk of becoming caricatures of mindfulness,missing the radical, transformational essence and becomingcaught perhaps by important but not necessarily fundamen-tal and often only super cial similarities between mindful- ness practices and relaxation strategies, cognitive-behavioralexercises, and self-monitoring tasks. Over the past 10 years numerous health professionals have taken on the teaching of mindfulness-based stress re-duction and have developed well-established clinical and CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY: SCIENCE AND PRACTICE V10 N2, SUMMER 2003 150research programs. Although there is no formal vehicle for assessing competency of MBSR teachers at this time, nora professional credentialing mechanism, 4the feedback from the people coming out of these programs, when we haveoccasion to meet them, tends to be highly enthusiastic andpositive. They themselves tend to speak of the experienceas transformative. There is a sense among those of us teach-ing mindfulness that we continue to be nurtured personallyand professionally by the work itself and by the practice.This, and a sense of connectedness with local and globalcommunities of colleagues who do this work are constantreminders of the importance of staying true to the spirit ofmindfulness practice. RECENT RESUL TS FROM THE CENTER FOR MINDFULNESS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FORTHE SCIENCE OF THE MIND/BODY CONNECTIONAND FURTHER STUDIES From a research perspective, work at the Center for Mind- fulness and the Stress Reduction Clinic has attempted toprovide various platforms upon which increasingly rigor-ous explorations of aspects of mindfulness and its clinicaland social applications could ultimately be built. A num-ber of early descriptive studies, reviewed by Baer (2003),attempted to investigate the validity and short- and long-term clinical e ectiveness of the MBSR intervention in patients with a wide range of medical conditions (Kabat-Zinn, 1982; Kabat-Zinn, Chapman, Miller, Fletcher, & Kabat-Zinn,1995;). This work eventually led us to undertake severalsmall randomized trials, one with patients with moderateto severe psoriasis undergoing ultraviolet phototherapytreatments (Kabat-Zinn et al., 1998), the other a worksiteintervention in which we delivered the 8-week MBSRprogram to company employees and monitored quanti-tative EEG and immune responsivity at various times, aswell as a range of psychosocial measures (Davidson et al.,in press). These studies demonstrated clinical e ectiveness with two very di erent mindfulness-based interventions: one delivered in isolation solely by audiotaped instruc-tions;the other, in the group context of MBSR. Their de-signs may serve as models in the design of further and largerstudies of the potential healing and restorative e ects of mindfulness and MBSR for di erent classes of individualswith di erent life situations in di erent environments. These studies are described below in some detail. Skin Clearing in Psoriasis In the psoriasis study we asked if mindfulness could in-fluence a healing process that we could see and photo- graph in people with a skin disease that has a strongrelationship with psychological stress, namely, psoriasis.Thirty-seven patients with moderate to severe psoriasiswho were candidates for treatment with phototherapy(UVB) or photochemotherapy (PUVA) were randomizedinto two groups. One group (meditators) followed guidedmindfulness meditation instructions delivered by audio-tape during their ultraviolet (UV) treatments (either PUVAor UVB) on a 3-times-per-week protocol. (For full studydesign and methods, see Kabat-Zinn et al., 1998). Thistape included a guided visualization in which the subjectvisualized the ultraviolet light slowing down and then stop-ping the rapidly growing cells in the epidermis. The othergroup (usual care) received the light treatments (eitherPUVA or UVB) without listening to a tape. The skin sta-tus of each patient was monitored by clinic nurses at eachtreatment session and documented periodically by pho-tography. The photographs were rated in terms of skin sta-tus by dermatologists blind to the identity and groupassignment of the patients. These ratings were then used tovalidate or invalidate the nurses' necessarily unblinded rat-ings. A Cox proportional hazards analysis of the photo-graphically validated data showed that the meditators' skincleared at about 4 times the rate of the nonmeditators'(usual care group) during the 12-week study period ( p= .033). An earlier and smaller study (Bernhard, Kristeller, &Kabat-Zinn, 1988) also found that the meditators' skincleared more rapidly than that of the nonmeditators. Although both studies su er from a small sample size, the replicability of the nding suggests that the e ect is real and merits further research. We cannot conclude fromthese observations that it is the mindfulness practice per sethat is responsible for the fourfold rate of skin-clearing inthe meditation cohort, although that is our hypothesis.However, the nding does lead to a number of potentially important, if currently tentative conclusions:(1) that somefactor or combination of factors having to do with the ac-tivity of mind can positively in fluence a healing process in a speci c disease; (2) that psychological participation of this sort on the part of the patient during the light treat-ments can lead to reduced time to clearing in at least some COMMENTARIES ON BAER 151patients, and thus to fewer treatments, and thus to poten- tial cost savings;(3) that the need for fewer light treatmentsalso reduces the risk of basal cell carcinoma associated withultraviolet light treatment; (4) that social support\u2014mini-mal in this intervention because the patient is isolated inthe light box, there is no group experience, and all theinstruction in the meditation is by audiotape\u2014cannot bea major factor in the observed outcome; (5) that the ex-perimental design itself is well suited for studying the roleof the mind (intention, attention, belief, expectation, psy-chological conditioning, meditation, visualization) in areadily observable healing process for a speci c disease down to the level of gene expression, including concurrentinvestigation of appropriate biological mediators associ-ated with psoriasis, and Bcl-x protein;(7) that, since psoriasis is an uncontrolled cell proliferation, although not onco-genic, such investigations may shed light on the potentialfor positive psychological involvement in oncogenic pro-cesses, such as basal cell carcinoma, which shares some mo-lecular characteristics with psoriasis;and (8) that this designis an example of both integrative (Snyderman & Weil,2002) meditative (unconventional) inter-vention is coextensive in time and place with the allopathictreatment, and participatory because the full engagementof the patient's mind and body is a critical part of the psy-chological intervention. All of these areas suggest furtherstudies that might illuminate critical issues in mind/bodymedicine and adjunctive psychological approaches to pa-tient care and treatment, including mindfulness-based ap-proaches with speci c diseases. Our 1998 study was criticized by Relman on various methodological grounds, including the small sample size,the way we accounted for dropouts, the e ectiveness of the blinding of physician-evaluators, and our statistical treat-ment of the data. He also took umbrage at our conclusions.While recognizing the validity of some of his criticisms, wewere able to respond to each one, refuting their criticalityeither to the basic observation or to our conclusions (seeRelman, Riley, Kabat-Zinn & Hosmer, 2001). I cite thisinterchange because it highlights the degree of controversythat occasionally arises, particularly regarding the quality ofthe evidence in studies investigating mind/body phenom-ena. Such controversy extends beyond the psoriasis study.Relman also challenged the validity of the ndings and conclusions of much larger clinical trials and epidemio-logical studies that are widely accepted in behavioral med-icine (see \"The Great Debate\": Relman & Angell, 2002;Williams and Schneiderman, 2002). Debates of this kind are welcome and healthy for any eld of research. They certainly underscore the importance of larger and better designed studies to further establish ordispute ndings in the nascent eld of mindfulness-based clinical interventions and their potential therapeutic e ects in people with speci c medical and psychological condi- tions, as called for by Baer (2003) and Bishop (2002). Theyalso illuminate the degree to which well-trained scientistscan and should disagree about the evidentiary status under-pinning even widely accepted of phenomena in the be-havioral and human sciences. Brain, Immune Changes, and Emotional Processing in a Work Site MBSR Program In another study (Davidson et al., in press) 41 employees of a biotechnology company were randomized to either anMBSR condition ( n= 25) or a wait-list condition ( 16). The MBSR subjects participated in an 8-week programduring working hours. All subjects underwent extensivelaboratory testing on three occasions, pre and post the 8-week intervention period and at 4-month follow-up,including EEG to measure brain electrical activity in re-sponse to various emotional challenges. All subjects werealso vaccinated with in fluenza vaccine at the end of the 8-week intervention period and subsequently tested forantibody titer. As originally hypothesized, we found signi cant in- creases in left-sided activation in the anterior cortical areain the subjects who had undergone MBSR training ascompared to the wait-list controls. Left-sided activation inseveral anterior regions has been observed during certainforms of positive emotional expression and in subjects withmore dispositional positive a ect (Davidson, 1992;David- son, Ekman, Saron, Senulis, & Friesen, 1990), as well as instudies of the highly trained Tibetan monk cited earlier, inwhom the e ect was of remarkable magnitude (Goleman, 2003). Right-sided activation is usually associated withnegative emotional expression such as anger, anxiety anddepression (Davidson, 2000; Davidson & Irwin, 1999). We also found that the meditators displayed a signi - cantly greater rise in antibody titers from the 4-week post-vaccination to the 8-week blood draw as compared tocontrol subjects. Moreover, among the subjects in theMBSR group, those who showed the greatest pre-to-post CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY: SCIENCE AND PRACTICE V10 N2, SUMMER 2003 152increase in left-sided activation displayed a signi cantly larger rise in antibody titers, whereas there was no signi - cant relationship for control subjects. This study suggeststhat MBSR training can lead to brain changes consistentwith more e ective handling of negative emotion under stress. These changes endured for at least 4 months after theintervention. T o our knowledge, this study is the rst to demon- strate a reliable e ect of meditation on an in vivo measure of immune function and on anterior activation asymme-try in the brain. The results suggest that there may bemultiple biological consequences of mindfulness trainingrelevant to emotional and physical health, and that such anintervention can be delivered e ectively in a work setting to a broad spectrum of employees and in fluence psycho- logical and emotional health under stressful conditions. Inlight of the ndings of T easdale et al. (2000) and the de- velopment of MBCT for relapse prevention in the treat-ment of depression (Segal et al., 2001), mindfulness/acceptance-based treatments for generalized anxiety dis-order (Roemer & Orsillo, 2002), DBT for borderline per-sonality 1993), and mindfulness-basedtherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder (Schwartz, 1996),these results suggest that it would be fruitful to exploremindfulness-based interventions in various a ective disor- ders, using an approach that maps potentially relevantunderlying neurobiological mechanisms and pathways to-gether with a ective behavior change measures, taking advantage in the study design of the intrinsic adaptabilityof mindfulness-based approaches to di erent life circum- stances and conditions. A New Prostate Cancer Intervention Combining MBSR and Dietary Intervention In addition to these studies, a recent uncontrolled pilot study (Saxe et al., 2001) combined and expanded MBSRtraining with a low-fat vegetarian dietary intervention toexplore the e ectiveness of this new 12-week intervention, which included spouses and signi cant others, in slowing, arresting, or reversing prostate-speci c antigen (PSA) ve- locity in men with prostate cancer who had previouslyundergone prostatectomies and who subsequently provedto have rising PSA levels, indicating metastatic spread. Ina series of 10 patients, we found that the rate of PSA in-crease decreased in 8 of the 10 patients, while 3 had a de-crease in absolute PSA (signed rank test p= .01). Estimated median PSA doubling time increased from 6.5 monthsbefore the intervention to 17.7 months after the interven-tion. This study demonstrates the potential feasibility andutility of using the cultivation of mindfulness within thecontext of MBSR to achieve behavior changes, such asdietary compliance, that are frequently di cult to attain and maintain with use of strictly behavioral motivators. Inthis case the mindfulness training and application was ex-tended to include bringing mindfulness to shopping andfood selection, cooking, and eating in ways that can en-hance dietary adherence. This remains an area of ongoinginvestigation. CONCLUSION Baer's conceptual and empirical review of mindfulness-based interventions points toward the potential promise offurther and increasingly methodologically rigorous studiesof mindfulness-based clinical interventions. This com-mentary highlights and contextualizes some of the funda-mental issues, opportunities, and challenges facing bothclinicians and researchers alike, in the design, delivery, andevaluation of such a deceptively simple yet highly complexintervention approach and its e ective integration, at the level of theory as well as treatment, with other therapiesand practices in medicine and psychology. It necessarilyglosses over or leaves undescribed the nature, spirit, andsubstance of the curriculum of mindfulness-based inter-ventions;the inherent flexibility of the curriculum in terms of both content and delivery and yet its reliance on essen-tial core meditative practices grounded in silence, stillness,self-inquiry, embodiment, emotional sensitivity, andacceptance of the full gamut of emotional expression heldin awareness (all practices that shape and inform the inter-vention and its unfolding at every level); and, nally, its acknowledgment of the universal longing in people forhappiness, well-being, resilience, and peace of mind, body,and soul, and how that longing might be e ectively met, honored, and mobilized for transformation among pro-gram participants (Kabat-Zinn, 1990; Santorelli, 1999).This commentary has perforce also ignored the poetry ofmindfulness, and the appropriate uses of the poetic imag-ination within mindfulness-based interventions. NOTES 1. Following Baer, I will not discuss the social-psychological construct that Langer (1989) has termed \"mindfulness,\" but focuson the traditional usage stemming from Buddhist meditationpractices that have been adapted to one degree or another and COMMENTARIES ON BAER 153integrated within the mainstream of medicine over the past 20- plus years. 2. Note that while this perspective may seem commonsen- sical, if not axiomatic\u2014just as surgeons who want to perform anunfamiliar complex procedure would rst need to acquire, from those who developed it or their designees, rst-person, hands-on experience through specialized postgraduate training before be-coming competent in performing it\u2014this proposition has notbeen subject to empirical testing in the case of mindfulness. Hayes(2002) has emphasized that methods involving acceptance andmindfulness must be separated from their religious and spiritualtraditions so they can be conceptualized and studied from a sci-entic perspective and integrated into Western psychological understanding. Of course, any true integration of a new and fun-damental element into psychology is likely to contribute to abroadening of the eld itself and its perspective on alternative epistemologies, in this case those epistemologies lying at the in-terface of meditative experience itself, in fluenced in some mea- sure by cultural and contextual considerations, and empiricalscience, as suggested by Walsh (1980). This area is one for fruit-ful research and deserving of rich debate and dialogue, whichcan only deepen the profession's ultimate understanding of whatworks, for whom, and why. I am merely delineating in this articlethe bare outlines of a perspective that my colleagues and I havedeveloped from both our own rsthand experience of meditation practice and teaching, and our clinical experience with medicalpatients undergoing training in MBSR in the context of main-stream medicine and health care. Of course, it is important topoint out that research has yet to probe systematically the rela-tionship between speci c outcomes of MBSR and the degree and depth (di cult to measure) of formal practices engaged in by participants, either in the classes themselves or between sessions,to achieve optimal clinical e ects. 3.
