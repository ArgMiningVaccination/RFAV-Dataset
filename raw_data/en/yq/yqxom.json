The earlier series on the same subject was brought out between 1984 and 1986 and covered such countries as India, Nepal, Pakistan and Thai land. Animal health is a major concern for the small farmers of most Asian countries. In general, animal health and nutritional status are rather very poor in these countries. A large popula tion of unproductive animals along with lack of pasture grazing land have compounded the problems facing the basic animal health care delivery system. Ever since the human life started in this earth, disease and death co -existed with him and with his animals. Therefore, efforts have been made to get relief out of it using herbs in various forms as a medicine from the very beginning of the human civilization. From the time immemorial, the traditional system of medicine was being practiced in the Region. Most of the traditional practitioners are not trained and the practices which came down from generation to generation had, in fact, become a culture in socio -economic life of the people in countries of the Region. Traditional veterinary medicines are the least expensive, can be locally prepared and traditionally rooted in the livestyle of the people. It should be decided to support them so that some positive steps be taken up into an integrated approach with other modern veterinary services.CONTENTS TRADITIONAL VETERINARY MEDICINE IN INDONESIA Page I.

But the nature also gives us all our need to live healthy. In nature, animal tends to find his own remedy whenever something wrong happened with his health from what available in the nature. It was known that cat is very fond of kind of a root of lalatang plant ( Acalypha indica Linn.) for his tonic. There is always a tendency for an overfed dog to eat a kind of grass ( Cyperus rotundus Linn.) to be able to vomit. The people has learnt these phenomena which were the beginning of the usage of herb for traditional medicine. For centuries the Indonesian people used to treat their ailment/diseases with the combination of herb (a mixture of leaves, roots, flowers, fruits, etc.), sometimes mixed with raw egg, honey or other substances. It was reported that the practice had been used since 300 years ago. The knowledge of the remedial mixture was inherited from generation to generation. Sometimes it was kept secret by certain families. But mostly the knowledge was kept by the traditional healer or traditional doctor who passed it on to their children or pupils only. Since Indonesia consists of more than 100 tribes, there are many recipes of traditional medicine. In many occasion, it was mixed with mysticism or magic. During that period, the traditional medicine was the only system practised among the people. The situation was changed with the coming of the western people in Indonesia in the 15th century. They brought along western medical knowledge. Realizing that the traditional medicine also based on. the usage of certain plants, many scientists/botanists tried to analyse some of the plants used in the traditional medicine. However, the written report on the finding was just published in the beginning of the middle of the 17th century, first by Jacobus Bontius (1592 - 1631) which were afterwa rd followed by other publications. Research on this direction was hastened when Bogor Botanical Garden was built in 1817. Although nowadays the western medical systems have been practised throughout Indonesia, even they could be found in the remote places, a majority of the people, especially in the rural areas still use and practise the traditional medicine which is called \" jamu\". It consists of a mixture of different herbs and substances to be drunk with bitter taste for tonic, beauty care and special treatment for headache, fever to chronic diseases. It also could be found as plaster used topically on the surface of certain parts of the body. Beside for their own sake, the people in the rural areas also use to apply the traditional veterinary medicine for their livestock.- 2 - For the dairy farmers who are mostly found in Java island, it is not so difficult to find external help in case there is any problem with their cattle, because most of them have joined village dairy cooperatives which provide as a part of their services, modern veterinary care to their members. But for other farmers, especially, those who live in remote places, the veteri nary services are not always easily available. In these areas, the farmers tends to treat their livestock first with their own knowledge on traditional veterinary medicine, especially if the disease problem is not so severe. Since most farmers are small holding farmers who keep their livestock nearby their houses and sometimes even under the same roof, it is not difficult for them to observe any change of the normal habit or diseases of their livestock. In fact, the traditional veterinary medicine, which consist of a mixture of herb, fruit, honey, eggs and other substances, is not only used for curing illness, but also for increasing their daily weight gain (for fattening cattle) and for increasing their condition or fighting spirit (for the racing bulls). Based on questionaires sent to the 27 Livestock Services, 7 Disease Investigation Centres and 5 Faculties of Veterinary Medicine throughout Indonesia, about 150 formulae of traditional veterinary medicine which were usually practised by the farmers have been received. Although the formulae came from different places there is a similarity in using these same herbs for curing the same disease problems with variations in combining the ingredients. In this text, the names of most herbs are described in the Indonesian language since it is difficult to find English name for them. But, their scientific names in Latin are always expressed in brackets. II. DISEASE SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENTS ANOREXIA This obvious sign of loosing appetite is easily detected by the farmers because most livestock are hand-fed. The simple practice is by mixing salt with the grass or giving concentrates which consist of rice bran, corn, cassava, etc. This effort is practised if the livestock are getting thin and also for the purpose of fattening.
