We hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving Holiday celebrating with family and friends. We love this time of a year because gratitude is at the foreground. In the season of thankfulness, one thing we are certainly thankful for is each and every one of you! Gratitude is another powerful way to change the brain and fight those negative thoughts that can creep in over the darker colder days. Speaking of which, we hope that the integration of mindfulness and exercise into your weekly routines has been helpful at fighting the winter blues. As Joni has shown us, practicing self-compassion when times get tough, noting what went well each day, and mindfully savoring moments can help us generate positive thoughts and attitudes. Mariah has helped us realize the power of being active, and the impact it has on our energy and outlook. The last installment of our 30-day-focus addresses how to supplement the benefits of the sun itself using light therapy and vitamin D supplements. Plus, we'll look at how talk therapy can help address the winter blues. Here's a little sneak peek. The winter blues are brought on in part by dropping levels of Vitamin D3 in our endocrine systems. Our primary source of D3 is sunshine, so during the winter months, our bodies are naturally deprived by the shortening of daylight hours and a decrease in the intensity of the sun's rays. With less D3 in our system, we can feel increasingly sluggish and anti-social. This is because D3 nourishes systems that help us process and deliver other nutrients throughout the body. Wow, the sun really does feed your body. So, what do we do when we just can't get enough sun? That is where light therapy and vitamin D supplements come in.
