Our blog post [HERE](https://www.generalwellnessnutrition.com/bloglist/2020/4/29/what-are-toxic-compounds-and-how-do-i-avoid-them?rq=toxic) explains how these products harm our health overall in a very significant way and which products you will commonly find them in! It becomes increasingly important when it comes to makeup, lotions, soaps, hair products, and other beauty products that go directly on our skin and you likely use daily. These are the products that I tried to switch first. How to Check Your Products for Toxins When looking for these in your products, it's so easy to check the ingredient label on the back of the products or even google the ingredients when necessary if it's not clearly labeled. This is a quick and easy way to identify what's in your products and if they are free of those big toxic compounds. As mentioned in the post all about these compounds, fragrance is another area that we can find parabens hidden and not labeled. Choosing fragrance free options or naturally fragranced products is a healthier alternative. ' How to Make the Switch to Non-Toxic Products While switching to non-toxic products all together was something I knew I wanted to do for my health, it wasn't realistic to make that switch right away! There's not always the freedom (or money) to throw everything away and go buy all new products. Not for me anyways! Instead, I slowly made the switch as my products ran out and used that time to research products I love and what would work best for me as replacements. And like with all things, food and nutrition included, it's important not to be obsessive and let these thoughts and ideas ruin your life. It's great to have a realistic and informed view of the harms that come from these compounds and make changes where we can, but there is balance to even this as well. I've found products I love that are free of the major toxins, but aren't necessarily \"non-toxic\" brands free and made only with plant-based materials. But these work for me, and I feel I've done my part to rid my life of toxins where I can within reason. So you'll find a balance of products in this post from what I found I loved the most. During the time I was making the switch I came across some amazing non-toxic products that also are now just my favorite products in general, regardless of their ingredients. Because it took some trial and error to find what actually worked, didn't have a weird texture (makeup mostly), and actually did it's job (cleaning products), I wanted to give you quick references so that you can skip the searching and make the switch to non-toxic products even easier. Products I Love: [Meyer's Clean Day Hand and Dish Soap](https://grove.pxf.io/zO0om) Meyer's Clean Day is a non-toxic company that truly makes great products! This brand has so many products that I love, but I specifically love their hand and dish soap because they're fragranced with natural essential oils and smell amazing. If you're looking to make the switch with some of these, you can receive a bunch of free products from your first order on Grove Collective, a curated subscription service for non toxic products, find out more [HERE](https://grove.pxf.io/zO0om)! Stasher Bags are an amazing non-toxic alternative to plastic bags. Plastic is one of the compounds that can be harmful and contain several toxins. Making the switch away from plastic can be a healthier and more sustainable practice for the environment as well! These Stasher Bags are reusable and come in all sizes - find yours on Amazon [HERE](https://amzn.to/2LJfyXp) Having the proper cookware is so important. As you can imagine, the pots & pans your food is cooked in has a HUGE impact on your health. Those made with toxic compounds can leach the harmful substances into the food you're cooking. So safe guard against this, using non-toxic cookware is key. [Caraway](https://caraway-home.pxf.io/Xxq1ra)is a company that makes high quality non-toxic cookware that is a game changer!

[Seventh Generation Dishwasher pods](https://amzn.to/3g4KrDn) I don't mess around when it comes to clean dishes...that's not something I want to take lightly. I've tried other non-toxic dishwasher pods from brand I love, but some left soap scum on our dishes and weren't a good product. But this brand, Seventh Generation, is an incredible non-toxic brand and their dishwasher pods work like a charm for clean, sparkling dishes. You can get yours either through [Grove Collective](https://grove.pxf.io/zO0om)or on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3g4KrDn). [Tarte Tartlette In Bloom Eyeshadow Palette](https://amzn.to/2LKPomV) Non-toxic makeup that actually works, looks good, stay on all day, and doesn't smell bad is actually so hard to fine. But Tarte has been my go-to brand for everything and I love their products! This eye shadow palette has the most beautiful colors and they stay on all day and look amazing. I even used this palette for my wedding makeup, if that tells you anything. You can even buy it on Amazon [HERE](https://amzn.to/2LKPomV). [Seventh Generation Laundry soap](https://amzn.to/2LWWGUZ) Everyone wants their clothes to be fresh and smell good, right?? I know I. do.

But this Seventh Generation Laundry soap has served us so well over the past few years and I love the natural lavender scent. You can also find it in unscented if you want! Buy yours on Amazon [HERE](https://amzn.to/2LWWGUZ) [Pantene Rosewater Shampoo and Conditioner](https://amzn.to/2zScZPV) I know what you're thinking, I've heard a thousand times people say \"Pantene isn't good for your hair\"... but what I will say to that is this - my hair grows SO fast, is very shiny, and healthy. I only get hair cuts once or twice a year and it works like a charm for me! And while it's not advertised as a Non Toxic company, this shampoo and conditioner is free of sulfates, parabens, and other toxic compounds other than fragrances. Find what works for you! But I love this shampoo and conditioner and you can snag it on Amazon [HERE](https://amzn.to/2zScZPV) Deodorant is a very personal thing, and I know personally that my biggest fear is smelling bad! Making the switch to natural deodorant was one of the last switches I made because it was hard for me to part with my antiperspirant. But i have grown to love Native and specifically the Lilac scent! It smells so good. I do have to apply it again later in the day most days to stay smelling fresh though. This Native brand has worked well for me, but I know there are lots of opinions on which is the best so you may have to experiment! You can try my favorite scent on Amazon [HERE](https://amzn.to/3ga2VlQ) [Rocky Mountain Soap Company Body Butter](https://www.rockymountainsoap.com/collections/organic-body-butter/products/unscented-body-butter) I have really, really dry skin. Finding a toxin free lotion for me that actually worked was really hard. I've loved Aveeno in the past and also the Coconut Body Butter from Trader Joe's. But the only thing I've found that really helps my dry skin is this Rocky Mountain Soap Company Body Butter! It comes in this deodorant-like stick that is so easy to apply. All natural ingredients too - find it [HERE](https://www.rockymountainsoap.com/collections/organic-body-butter/products/unscented-body-butter). Whatever products you decide to switch is great, even if it's just a few you commonly use! The point of this isn't to obsess over it and become paranoid. The point is to educate yourself about what's in the products you use and learn how they can potentially impact our health long term! There are so many great options out there that are effective, do what you want them to do, smell great, and aren't going to break the bank when it comes to non-toxic products. My goal was to share some of my favorites with you in hopes that you find what you love too! What products are your favorites?
