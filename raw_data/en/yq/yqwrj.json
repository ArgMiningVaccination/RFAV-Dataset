Students take all the courses in the one-year program curriculum along with MCAT preparation, MPH courses, and volunteer experiences. Course sequence* Year One||Credit Hours| |BM530: Foundational |BM525: Medical School Prep||1| |Total||10 | Students must complete both years of the program to be eligible to matriculate into EVMS. *Please note that the curriculum has been updated to reflect the new MD curriculum **Courses taken with first-year medical students. Although the program does not specify a specific MCAT score to be eligible to take the second year and complete the program, students will need a score of at least 503 and a 3.5 average GPA to be competitive for most allopathic medical schools. Course Descriptions Fall Semester: Year One BM530 - Foundational Science II Foundational Science II is a 17-week module divided into four blocks. In the first block, molecular and cell biology will be reviewed. In block two, metabolism and cell signaling will be covered. In the third block, the interaction of cells with their environment will be explored, including the structure and function of tissues, electrical activity in cellular function, autonomic physiology and the basic principles of biostatistics and pharmacology will be introduced. In the final block of the module, a brief introduction to microorganisms will be provided and then learning the foundations of immunology. Together, the module will provide the foundational building blocks necessary to progress to subsequent modules in the curriculum. MPH611 - Social & Behavioral Sciences for Public Health This course is a social and behavioral sciences core course for the MPH program. Psychological, social, and cultural concepts and models relevant to health and disease in society are reviewed and critiqued. The course will enable students to describe core theoretical perspectives from each of the social science disciplines of psychology, sociology, and anthropology. Students will learn how to select and apply appropriate social and behavioral models to the design of public health interventions and policies. The course will also cover existing social inequalities in health status related to race, social class, and gender, and the critical intersection between social risk factors, behavioral risk factors, and the development and implementation of public health interventions. Social ecological models that influence population health at multiple levels are emphasized. BM524 - Medical School Prep Medical School Prep will discuss the expectations of a medical student/physician, on overview of community engaged learning opportunities, and application preparation guidance. The 15 AAMC Core Compentencies for medical school students will be reviewed, why they are important in a future career as a physician, and how one might display them through application materials. Students will also be instructed on how to participate in Community Engaged Learning at EVMS, and an average of 40 hours each semester of engagement will be required. Finally, the MD and DO medical school applications will be reviewed, including personal statements and topics such as how to decide where to apply and budgeting for the application cycle will be discussed. Twice a semester reflections will be due covering topics such as characteristics of a good medical student/physician and resilience and wellness. Spring Semester: Year One MPH 614 - Principles Of Epidemiology An introduction to epidemiology as a body of knowledge and a method for analyzing community health problems. Emphasis is on how to measure and describe the health of populations, the natural history of diseases in population groups, standardization of rates, sources of data, study designs, measurements of risk, evaluation of screening tests, causal inferences and outbreak investigation. This course includes lectures, reading and individual and group assignments. MB534 - MCAT Preparation The students will take an MCAT preparation course taught by Kaplan Test Prep during the spring of year 1. EVMS faculty advisors and academic counselors will monitor students' progress in the course. MPA5341 - Legal and Ethical Issues in Medicine Examination of the relationships and impact of health law and medical ethics in healthcare by analyzing case studies of contemporary health issues. BM525 - Medical School Prep Medical School Prep will discuss the expectations of a medical student/physician, on overview of community engaged learning opportunities, and application preparation guidance. The 15 AAMC Core Compentencies for medical school students will be reviewed, why they are important in a future career as a physician, and how one might display them through application materials. Students will also be instructed on how to participate in Community Engaged Learning at EVMS, and an average of 40 hours each semester of engagement will be required. Finally, the MD and DO medical school applications will be reviewed, including personal statements and topics such as how to decide where to apply and budgeting for the application cycle will be discussed. Twice a semester reflections will be due covering topics such as characteristics of a good medical student/physician and resilience and wellness. Fall Semester: Year Two BM 536 - Human Structure The Human Structure course provides a comprehensive overview of clinically relevant human anatomy through a case-based, collaborative approach. The module describes the human body's form, structure, function, and development by recognizing typical variations and using these variations to describe and explain clinically relevant abnormalities. Students utilize critical thinking skills and then learn to integrate the anatomical sciences, and medical imaging while engaging with content that strongly emphasizes cultural humility, professionalism, and ethical behavior. BM 501 - Foundations of Disease Foundations of Disease teaches foundational knowledge that provides the fundamental building blocks necessary to progress to subsequent organ system modules within the curriculum. This course covers molecular cell biology and biochemistry, the interaction of cells with their environment, including the structure and function of tissues, electrical activity in cellular function, autonomic physiology, and the basic principles of pharmacology. The course prioritizes the principles for discriminating healthy from pathologic conditions and predicting clinical manifestations from available data. It further integrates the general mechanisms of disease with an introduction to pathology and genetics. Microorganisms are introduced to provide context for the foundations of immunology, infectious disease, and relevant pharmacology. Students will also learn and apply the basic principles of biostatistics and the scientific method as they apply them to clinical problems Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). BM 519 - Presentation Skills and Professional Knowledge This course will explore non-academic aspects of preparing for admission to and success in medical school. The students will develop communication skills by engaging in team-based activities and mock interviews. They will be introduced to clinical skills by participating in standardized patient encounters. Group activities will help students develop their professionalism and professional identity. Guest physician lecturers will enhance the students' knowledge of the practice of medicine. BM 502 - Introduction to Organ Systems Introduction to Organ Systems represents the transition to organ system courses in the Care Forward Curriculum. Students will explore the histology, immunology, microbiology, pathology, physiology/pathophysiology, and pharmacology of the following - heme, musculoskeletal (muscle/bone), skin, and gastrointestinal organ systems. Integration is achieved across all major medical basic science disciplines, from normal anatomic and physiologic functions to abnormal disease states to relevant pharmacotherapy. BM 503- Hormones The Hormones course will enable students to acquire and apply knowledge of internal homeostasis/metabolism from basic science to clinical situations. Students will review the embryological and anatomical development of the endocrine system; they will acquire and apply physiological, pharmacological, and pathological knowledge necessary to prevent, evaluate, and treat metabolic, and endocrine disorders.
