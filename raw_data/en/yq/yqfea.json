Respondent-appellant Michelle Ricco Jonas (\"Ricco Jonas\"), the Program Manager for New Hampshire's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (the \"PDMP\"), appeals from a dis-trict court judgment ordering compliance with an ad- ministrative subpoena issued to her by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") pur-suant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876, to produce the PDMP-kept prescription drug records of an individual. 1 On appeal, Ricco Jonas contends that the subpoena is unenforcea-ble because, although it was issued to her and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(c) authorizes the en forcement of a \"subp[o]ena issued to any person,\" in her view, the subpoena really targeted the State of New Hampshire and states are not \"person[s]\" within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(c) against whom administrative subpoenas may be is-sued and enforced. Additionally, she argues that, even if 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(c) generally authorizes the enforce- ment of administrative subpoenas against a state, the Fourth Amendment still poses a bar to compliance be- cause the subpoena-specified individual has a reason- able expectation of privacy in his prescription drug records, thereby allowing disclosure only after a find- ing of probable cause by a court. After careful consid- eration, we reject both of Ricco Jonas's contentions and affirm the district court judgment. 1 During the pendency of this appeal, Ricco Jonas informed us that she is no longer the PDMP program manager. Neverthe-less, neither party has suggeste d that the appeal is moot. App. 6 I. STATUTORY BACKGROUND A. The Controlled Substances Act In 1970, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act (the \"Act\"), Pub. L. No. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236, to \"consolidate vari-ous drug laws on the books into a comprehensive stat- ute, provide meaningful regulation over legitimate sources of drugs to prevent diversion into illegal chan- nels, and strengthen law enforcement tools against the traffic in illicit drugs.\" Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 10 (2005). The main objectives of Title II of the Act, the Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\"), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., are \"to conquer drug abuse and to control the le- gitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled sub-stances.\" 2 Raich, 545 U.S. at 12; id. at 12-13 (\"Congress was particularly concerned with the need to prevent the diversion of drugs from legitimate to illicit chan-nels.\"). To achieve these go als, Congress established a \"closed regulatory system\" that makes it unlawful \"to manufacture, distribute, disp ense, or possess any con- trolled substance except as authorized by the CSA.\" Id. at 13 (citing 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a )(1), 844(a)). As part of this regulatory system, \"[t]he CSA requires manufac-turers, physicians, pharmacies, and other handlers of 2 The CSA categorizes controlled substances into five sched- ules (I through V), based on the drugs' potential for abuse, ac-cepted medical uses, and likelihood of causing psychological or physical dependency. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812. Drugs categorized in sched-ules II through V have \"a currently accepted medical use in treat- ment in the United States\" or \"a currently accept ed medical use with severe restrictio ns.\" Id. \u00a7\u00a7 812(b)(2)-(5). Schedule I drugs do not have any accepted medi cal use. Id. \u00a7 812(b)(1). App. 7 controlled substances to comply with statutory and regulatory provisions mandating registration with the DEA, compliance with specific production quotas, secu- rity controls to guard against diversion, recordkeeping and reporting obligations, and prescription require- ments.\" Id. at 27 (citing \u00a7 1301 et seq. (2004)). The CSA authorizes the Attorney General to issue administrative subpoenas to investigate suspected il-licit drug activity. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876. Specifically, \u00a7 876(a) of the statute provides in relevant part that, In any investigation . . . with respect to con- trolled substances . . . the Attorney General may subpe[o]na witnesses, compel the attend-ance and testimony of witnesses, and require the production of any records (including books, papers, documents, and other tangible things which constitute or contain evidence) which the Attorney General finds relevant or material to the investigation. The attendance of witnesses and the production of records may be required from any place in any State or in any territory or ot her place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. . . . Id. \u00a7 876(a). The Attorney General has delegated this authority to the DEA. See id. C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 4. 876(c) of the CSA provides for judicial en- forcement of subpoenas issued under \u00a7 876(a). It states that, App. 8 In the case of contumacy by or refusal to obey a subp[o]ena issued to any person, the Attor- ney General may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which the investigation is carried on or of which the subp[o]enaed person is an inhabit- ant, or in which he carries on business or may be found, to compel compliance with the subp[o]ena. The court may issue an order re- quiring the subp[o]enaed person to appear be-fore the Attorney General to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in any judicial district in which such person may be found. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(c). The CSA provides that state law is preempted whenever \"there is a positive conflict be- tween [a] provision of th[e] [CSA] and [a] State law so that the two cannot consistently stand together.\" Id. \u00a7 903. B. The PDMP and New Hampshire Law In 2012, the New Hampshire legislature estab- lished the PDMP to \"enhanc[e] patient care, curtail[ ] the misuse and abuse of controlled substances, combat[ ] illegal trade in and diversion of controlled substances, and enabl[e] access to prescription information by prac- titioners, dispensers, and other authorized individuals App. 9 and agencies.\"3 New Hampshire PDMP, https://www. newhampshirepdmp.com/ (last visited Jan. 27, 2022). The PDMP operates an electronic system that \"fa- cilitate[s] the confidential sharing of information relat- ing to the prescribing and dispensing of schedule II-IV controlled substances\" within the State. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 126-A:90. Every dispense r - \"a person or entity who is lawfully authorized to deliver a schedule II-IV controlled substance\" - must report certain information each time a schedule II-IV drug is dispensed, includ- ing: dispenser's DEA registration number; prescriber's DEA registration number; patient's name, address, and date of birth; National Drug Code 4 of drug dis- pensed; quantity dispensed; date of dispensing; num- ber of refills granted; whether the prescription is new or a refill; and, source of payment, among others. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 126-A:89(VI), 126-A:91(VI)(a)-(o). This information is then stored in the PDMP database.5 3 The PDMP is currently administered by the New Hamp- shire Department of Health and Human Services. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 126-A:89-:96. The PDMP has been previously adminis- tered by the New Hampshire Office of Professional Licensure and Certification and the New Hampshire Board of Pharmacy. 4 National Drug Codes are unique, three-segment numbers which serve as identifiers for drugs. U.S. Food and Drug Admin-istration, National Drug Code Directory, https://www.fda.gov/ drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/national-drug-code-directory (last visited Jan. 27, 2022). 5 The information is deleted from the database three years \"after the initial prescription was dispensed.\" N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 126-A:90(III). App. 10 New Hampshire state law provides that all infor- mation contained in or obtained from the PDMP \"is confidential,\" and \"is not subject to discovery, sub- poena, or other means of legal compulsion for release.\"6 Id. \u00a7 126-A:92(I). Law enforcement may request infor- mation from the PDMP \"on a case-by-case basis for the purpose of investigation and prosecution of a criminal offense when presented with a court order based on probable cause.\" Id. \u00a7 126-A:93( I)(b)(3). However, \"[n]o law enforcement agency or official shall have direct ac- cess to query program information.\" Id. In addition to the stat e-kept PDMP database, New Hampshire also requires practitioners - including phy- sicians, pharmacists, and hospitals - to maintain their own, similar records \"to sh ow the receipt and disposi- tion of all drugs.\" Id. \u00a7 318-B:12(I). These practitioners' records must \"meet the requirements of the department of health and human services and federal laws and regulations, \" and \"shall indicate at least the name, dosage form, strength, and quantity of the controlled drug; the name and address of any per-son to whom the drug was administered, dispensed, sold or transferred and the date of any and all trans- actions involved with the controlled drug.\" Id. Unlike PDMP data, law enforcement officials may access a practitioner's own records without a court order. Id. 6 The Department of Health and Human Services \"may use and release information and reports from the program for pro-gram analysis and evaluation, st atistical analysis, public re- search, public policy, and educational purposes, provided that the data are aggregated or otherwise de-identified at all levels of 126-A:92(III). App. 11 \u00a7 318-B:12(II) (\"[Practitioners' records] shall be open for inspection only to fede ral, state, county and munic- ipal law enforcement officers [and others] . . . whose duty it is to enforce the la ws of [New Hampshire] or of the United States relating to controlled drugs.\"). II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND On June 11, 2018, the DEA issued an administra- tive subpoena to \"Michelle Ricco Jonas, Program Man-ager NH PDMP\" pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(a). The subpoena, which was served on Ricco Jonas on June 13, 2018, stated that \"[ p]ursuant to an investiga- tion of violations of 21 U.S. C. 801 et seq., [she was] to provide any and all records regarding [REDACTED], being maintained by the New Hampshire Prescription Drug Monitoring Program from February 28, 2016 through present day.\" 7 On July 12, 2018, Ricco Jonas objected to the sub- poena in a letter from the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office sent to the DEA. The letter stated that the subpoena was issued to her in her official capacity 7 The DEA had previously served an administrative sub- poena on the PDMP requesting the same information. The New Hampshire Attorney General objected on the ground that the CSA allegedly does not authorize the DEA to subpoena states or their sovereign agencies. He further argued that, although pur-suant to \u00a7 876(c) of the CSA the DEA could enforce a subpoena against \"any person,\" neither the State nor its sove reign agencies were \"persons\" against whom the subpoena could be enforced. Without conceding the point, the DEA subsequently served the subpoena naming Ricco Jonas. App. 12 as the Program Manager of the PDMP, rather than in her personal capacity, and thus amounted to a sub- poena issued to the State. According to Ricco Jonas, be- cause 21 U.S.C \u00a7 876 does not authorize the DEA \"to subpoena a [s]tate, its sovereign agencies, or its offi- cials serving in their officia l capacities,\" the subpoena was unenforceable. The letter directed the DEA to fol-low state law and obtain a court order based on proba- ble cause to obtain the desired information. On August 8, 2018, the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") filed a petition to compel compliance with the administrative subpoena in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. In its peti- tion, the DOJ addressed Ricco Jonas's objections from the July 12 letter and argued that those objections failed because the subpoena was issued to Ricco Jonas in her personal capacity and sought no relief from the State. In addition, the DOJ contended that even if the subpoena was directed to the State of New Hampshire, it was nonetheless enforceable because, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the CSA's use of \"any person\" in \u00a7 876(c) includes a stat e and its agencies. Finally, the DOJ submitted that th e CSA preempts any state law limitations on the DEA's authority to issue admin-istrative subpoenas. Ricco Jonas opposed the petition for essentially the same reasons she asserted in the July 12 letter, along with a new argument based upon the Fourth Amendment. Ricco Jonas contended that even if the CSA permits the issuance of subpoenas to states, pa- tients have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their App. 13 prescription drug records under the Fourth Amend- ment and the DEA must therefore secure a court order based on probable cause before it can obtain PDMP data. After a hearing, a magistrate judge issued a Re- port and Recommendation (\"R&R\") in which she rec-ommended that the court grant the DOJ's petition to compel. U.S. Dep't of Justice v. Ricco Jonas, No. 18-MC- 56-LM, 2018 WL 6718579, at *1 (D.N.H. Nov. The magistrate judge rejected Ricco Jonas's \"proposi- tion that her being served because of her position as PDMP manager convert[ed ] th[e] subpoena enforce- ment action [under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(c)] into a suit against the State of New Hampshire.\" Id. at *3. She reasoned that because th e subpoena enforcement pro- ceeding would not result in a judgment of any kind re- quiring financial payment from the State, it was not a suit against the State. Id. The magistrate judge found that the DEA issued the s ubpoena to Ricco Jonas be- cause she had \"custody and control over PDMP infor- mation,\" id., and reasoned that whether she must comply with it in her official or personal capacity was \"irrelevant.\" Id. at *4, *5 n.5. In light of this, the mag- istrate judge deemed it unnecessary to reach the issue of statutory interpretation and decide whether a state is a \"person\" under 21 U.S. C. \u00a7 876(c) subject to the DEA's subpoena power. Id. at *4. The magistrate judge next determined that the CSA preempted New Hamp- shire's statutory requirement that law enforcement of- ficials obtain an order based on probable cause before obtaining PDMP data. Id. at *4-5. Finally, because she App. 14 deemed the issue non-dispositive, the magistrate judge assumed without deciding that Ricco Jonas had stand- ing - either in her own right or on behalf of others - to make the Fourth Amendment argument. Id. at *6. Nonetheless, she concluded that patients have no rea- sonable expectation of privacy in their prescription drug records. Id. She reasoned that the closely regu- lated nature of the prescription drug industry, the state law requirement that the information be trans- mitted to the PDMP, and its provisions allowing that the data be shared in certain limited circumstances \"operate to diminish the privacy expectation in pre- scription drug records.\" Id. at *6-7. After additional briefing from both sides, the dis-trict court adopted the R&R and entered judgment in the DOJ's favor. U.S. Dep't of Justice v. Ricco Jonas, No. 19-CV-030-LM, 2019 WL 251246 (D.N.H. Jan. 17, 2019). Ricco Jonas timely appealed. III. DISCUSSION On appeal, Ricco Jonas challenges the district court's conclusions that the subpoena is enforceable under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(c) and that the Fourth Amend- ment poses no bar to the disclosure of the prescription drug records to the DEA without a court order based on probable cause. We review a district court's decision to enforce an administrative subpoena for abuse of discretion, even if it \"implicate[s] the priva cy interests protected by the Fourth Amendment\" or other questions of law. McLane App. 15 Co. v. EEOC, 137 S. Ct. 1159, 1169-70 (2017). \"A district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous v iew of the law.\" Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., Drys- dale v. Spirito, 689 F.2d 252, 256 (1st Cir. 1982) (noting that issues of statutory construction are legal issues). A. The Target of the Ad ministrative Subpoena \"The requirements for enforcement of an adminis- trative subpoena are not onerous.\" United States v. Sturm, Ruger & Co., 84 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1996). \"In order to obtain judicial backi ng the agency must prove that (1) the subpoena is issued for a congressionally authorized purpose, the information sought is (2) rele-vant to the authorized purpose and (3) adequately de- scribed, and (4) proper procedures have been employed in issuing the subpoena.\" Id. (citing United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U.S. 632, 652 (1950)). Only the first requirement is at issue here. A challenge to a sub- poena on that ground alone will fail \"[a]s long as the agency's assertion of authori ty is not obviously apocry- phal.\" Id. at 5-6 (citing FTC v. Swanson, 560 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1977)). The CSA provides that administrative subpoenas may be issued \"[i]n any investigation relating to . . . controlled substances\" \"require the records . . . which the [DEA] finds relevant or ma- terial to the investigation . . . from any any State.\" \u00a7 876(a). The CSA includes an en- forcement mechanism that allows the DEA to invoke App. 16 the aid of federal courts \"[i]n case of contumacy by or refusal to obey a subp[o]ena issued to any person.\" Id. \u00a7 876(c). Although Ricco Jonas does not dispute the DEA's congressional authority under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(a) to is- sue a subpoena to her, she contends that, because in order to comply with the subpoena she would need to use her state-issued credent ials to acce ss state-col- lected data and provide it to the DEA, the State of New Hampshire is the subpoena's \"true target.\" This, in her view, makes the instant subpoena one issued to the State, and this enforcement proceeding a \"suit\" against the State. She posits that the CSA does not authorize courts to enforce subpoenas issued to states because, under her reading of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(c), states are not \"person[s]\" to whom subpoe nas may be issued. Accord- ingly, she concludes, the instant subpoena was not \"is- sued for a congressionally authorized purpose\" and is not enforceable. In response, the DOJ argues that the DEA issued its subpoena to Ricco Jonas, not to the State of New Hampshire, and that \"requiri ng a state employee to produce records is no t compelling the stat e to act; it is requiring the employee to act by producing records over which she has control.\" The DOJ further argues that, even if the instant subpoena is deemed to have been issued to the State, it is enforceable because 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876 authorizes the issuance and enforcement of subpoenas against states. App. 17 To support her argument that the instant sub- poena was issued to the St ate and that this enforce- ment proceeding constitutes a suit against the State, Ricco Jonas invokes the principle, often arising in the Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity context, that a suit against a state employee seeking relief from a state is a suit against the state. But even under case law applying that principle, courts have rejected the invitation by state officers to blur the distinction be- tween state officers and the states. Instead, courts have validated the service of process to state officers for the production of document s or objects in their pos- session or control as person s independent of the states, and regardless of whether the states elect to defend on behalf of their officers. See, e.g., Fla. Dep't of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U.S. 670, 691-92 (1982) (plurality holding that serv ice of process served on state officials for the transfer of some property in the state officials' possession \"was directed only at state of-ficials and not at the State it self or any agency of the State\" and thus did not constitute a \"direct action against the State\" under the Eleventh Amendment even if \"the State elected to defend on behalf of its agents\"); Barnes v. Black, 544 F.3d 807, 812 (7th Cir. 2008) (noting that orders commanding non-party state officials to produce documents in the states' possession for use in a litigation between private persons \"do not compromise state sovereignty to a significant de-gree,\" hence, do not violate the Eleventh Amendment); Laxalt v. McClatchy, 109 F.R.D. 632, 634-35 (D. Nev. 1986) (rejecting claim by the Nevada State Gaming Control Board that the Eleventh Amendment barred App. 18 compliance with a federal discovery subpoena served upon the Board's custodian of records for inspection and copying of records). Furthermore, even under the principle on which Ricco Jonas relies, courts ha ve concluded that \"[t]he service of a federal subpoena on an employee of an en-tity [that is protected by sovereign immunity],\" such as the State of New Hampshire, \"is neither a suit, nor one against [the entity].\" United States v. Juvenile Male 2d 1012, 1016 (D. Supp. 2d 1074, 1078-79 (E.D. Cal. 2008) (holding that the issuance and required compli- ance with discovery subpoenas directed to custodians of records of state agencies under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure did not constitute a \"suit in law or eq-uity\" within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment); Juvenile Male 1, 431 F. Supp. 2d at 1016 (holding in a proceeding to enforce a subpoena duces tecum issued under Rule 17(b) and (c) of the Federal Rules of Crim-inal Procedure that \"sovereign immunity from suit [lacks] any application to the enforcement of a federal subpoena on the custodian of records of a state or fed- eral agency\"). Some courts have reasoned that an en- forcement proceeding seeking to compel a state officer to comply with a subpoena for state records that may only be obtained through the state's custodian of rec- ords does not constitute a suit against the state be- cause such proceeding does no t assert a claim in law or equity against the state or its officer. See, e.g., Allen, 544 F. Supp. 2d at 1079. \"No judgment will be issued . . . against the State that could have any conceivable App. 19 effect on the State treasury; the State custodian[ ] [is] only subpoenaed to produce do cuments for use in [a lit- igation not involving the State or the State custodian].\" Id. We find this reasoning persuasive. Here, the en- forcement proceeding does not involve a claim in law or equity against the State of New Hampshire. Nor will a judgment be issued against the State that could have a conceivable effect on New Hampshire's treasury. The relief sought by the DEA through this enforcement proceeding is merely an order for Ricco Jonas to pro-duce records to be used by the DEA in its investigation of violations involving controlled substances and only she, not the State, may be fo und to be in contempt of court for failing to comply with a court order enforcing the subpoena. Although Ricco Jonas complains that the cases cited herein involved discovery subpoenas issued un- der other statutory provisions to obtain documents for pending litigation, she fails to meaningfully discuss, and we fail to see, why such distinction should lead to a different conclusion in this case. 8 After all, an admin- istrative subpoena \"amount[s] to no more than a sim- ple direction to produce do cuments, subject to judicial review and enforcement.\" Sturm, Ruger & Co., 84 F.3d at 3 (citing, among other authority, Okl. Press Pub. Co. v. Walling, 327 U.S. 186, 195 (1946)). And a proceeding 8 Nor does she explain why the logic of the cases cited should not control merely because, in her view, this case involves an issue \"of statutory interpretation, not Eleventh Amendment immun-ity,\" especially when she herself relied on sovereign immunity principles in making her arguments. App. 20 to enforce an administrative subpoena, such as the one established in 21 U.S.C. McLane Co., 137 S. Ct. at 1168, by allowing the agency to use \"one of the tools\" that Congress placed \"at its disposal in conducting its investigation[s].\" Id. at 1164. In light of the above, we are unpersuaded by Ricco Jonas's arguments that New Hampshire was the in- stant subpoena's true target and that this enforcement proceeding constitutes a suit against the State. Fur- thermore, even if we were to find that the subpoena was really issued to the St ate, Ricco Jonas's challenge would still fail because as ex plained below, states, their agencies, and their officials in their official capacities are \"persons\" within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(c) against whom subpoenas may be enforced. B. Statutory Construction of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876 The parties dispute whether 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(a) au- thorizes the Attorney General to issue administrative subpoenas to states and to enforce them under \u00a7 876(c). Because this is an issue of statutory construc- tion, we turn to the language of the statute. See In re Fin. Oversight & Mgmt. Bd. for P.R., 919 F.3d 121, 128 (1st Cir. 2019) (\"[I]n resolving a dispute over the mean- ing of a statute we begin wi th the language of the stat- ute itself.\" (citing Landreth Timber Co. v. Landreth, 471 U.S. 681, 685 (1985))). App. 21 The Attorney General's subpoena power derives from \u00a7 876(a) of the CSA. Congress used very broad language in that section: \"In any investigation relating to . . . may . . production of any records . . . which [he] finds relevant or material to the investiga-tion. . . . from any place U.S.C. \u00a7 876(a) (emphasis added). Ricco Jonas urges us to find that, despite this broad language, the Attorney Gen- eral's subpoena authority is limited by \u00a7 876(c), which provides that \"[i]n the case of contumacy by or refusal to obey a subp[o]ena issued to any person, the Attorney General may invoke the aid of [federal courts].\" Id. \u00a7 876(c). According to Ricco Jonas, because the CSA does not define \"person,\" we must presume that such term does not include the sovereign, and construe \u00a7 876(a) consistent with su ch limitation. She further argues that \"the text, structure, purpose, legislative history, and executive interpretation\" of the CSA all lead to the conclusion that states, their agencies, and their officials are not \" 'persons' who may be targeted and commanded to comply with administrative inves-tigatory subpoenas.\" In the absence of an ex press statutory definition, we apply a \"longstanding interpretative presumption that 'person' does not include the sovereign.\" 9 Return 9 This presumption both \"reflects 'common usage' \" and is \"an express directive from Congress,\" which has set forth in the Dic- tionary Act that, unless context indicates otherwise, \"person\" includes \"corporations, companie s, associations, firms, partner- ships, societies, and joint stock co mpanies, as well as individuals.\" Return Mail, Inc. v. USPS, 139 S. Ct. 1853, 1862 (2019) (first App. 22 Mail, Inc. v. USPS, 139 S. Ct. 1853, 1861-62 (2019) (quoting Vt. Agency of Nat. Res. v. U.S. ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 780-81 (2000)). This presumption, how- ever, \"is not a 'hard and fast rule of exclusion' \" and \"may be disregarded upon some affirmative showing of statutory intent to the contrary.\" Id. at 1862 (first quot- ing United States v.

Ricco Jonas's contention that the Attorney Gen- eral's authority conferred in \u00a7 876(a) is limited by \u00a7 876(c) is not the most natur al reading of the statute. Furthermore, the purpose of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876, its con- text, and its legislative hist ory all point to the conclu- sion that Congress intended to bring states within the scope of the Attorney General's subpoena power under \u00a7 876(a) and subject to \u00a7 876( c)'s judicial enforcement provision. Prior to the enactment of the Act in 1970, \"most domestic drug regulations . . . generally came in the guise of revenue laws, with the Department of the quoting United States v.

Before 1955, the Secretary of Treasury had no authority to sub-poena witnesses or to require the production of records with respect to the enforcement of federal laws relat- ing to narcotic drugs. H.R. Rep. No. 84-1247 (1955); H.R. Rep. No. 84-1347 (1955). At the time, it was \"nec- essary for the enforcement of ficers of the Treasury De- partment to obtain subp[o ]enas through the Federal courts upon a showing of sufficient evidence to justify the issuance of the subp[o]enas.\" H.R.

Under this provision , records were subject to the subpoena authority of the Secretary of Treasury as long as he deemed them relev ant or material to an in- vestigation relating to narcotic drugs or marihuana laws, regardless of who the records belonged to or who was their custodian. See 101 Cong. Rec. 11,683 (re- marks of Rep. Jenkins summarizing that the House bill would authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to subpoena \"any records\" which the Secretary found \"necessary or relevant to an investigation in connec-tion with the enforcement of laws pertaining to nar- cotic drugs and marihuana\"). The bill included an enforcement mechanism that allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to invoke the aid of federal courts \"[i]n case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subp[o]ena issued to[ ] any person.\" Pub. L. No. 362, \u00a7 3. As ex-plained in the Congressional Record, the intent was to \"establish a contempt procedure as a means of compel- ling compliance with any summons issued pursuant to the authority granted [under the statute].\" 101 Cong. Rec. 11,683 (remarks of Rep. Cooper) (emphasis added); see also S. Rep. No. 1247 (explaining that the bill included a provision establishing \"a contempt pro- cedure before Federal district judges as a means of compelling compliance with any summons issued\" under the statute); H.R. Rep. No. 84-1347 (same). App. 25 Congress sought to provide the Secretary of the Treas- ury with \"an invaluable weapon in the enforcement of the laws relating to narcotic drugs and marihuana.\" S. Rep. No. 1247; H.R. Rep. No . 84-1347; see also United States v. Pardo-Bolland, 348 F.2d 316, 321 (2d Cir. 1965) (noting \"[t]he ease wi th which the Secretary of the Treasury [could] legally authorize the issuance of a subpoena in furtherance of a narcotics investiga- tion\"). Public Law 362 was 876's predecessor. The stat- utory language of \u00a7 876 is identical in all relevant parts to that of Public La w 362. Congress's grant of au- thority to the Attorney General in \u00a7 876(a) is as broad as that of its predecessor, and its plain language allows for the subpoena of \"any records\" in \"any investigation\" relating to controlled substances as long as the Attor- ney General finds the records relevant or material to the investigation and such records are located in any State, territory, or within the jurisdiction of the United States. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(a). See United States v. Moun- tain States Tel. & Tel. Co., 516 F. Supp. 225, 230 (D. Wyo. 1981) (stating that the subpoena powers under \u00a7 876 and Public Law 362 are coterminous); see also United States v. Moffett, 84 F.3d 1291, 1293 (10th Cir. 1996) (stating that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(a) \"is written to give the DEA broad powers to investigate violations of fed- eral drug laws\"). Ricco Jonas does not contest that the statutory language authorizing the Attorney General to issue ad-ministrative subpoenas under \u00a7 876(a) is broad or that its plain language does not limit law enforcement's App. 26 authority to obtain records relevant to its investiga- tions based on who holds such records. She posits, however, that we must read \u00a7 876(a)'s language in tan- dem with \u00a7 876(c) which, in her view, limits the Attor- ney General's authority. But Ricco Jonas's proposed reading is not consistent with Congress's intent as re- vealed in the legislative history of Public Law 362. The legislative history reveals that \u00a7 876(c) was not meant to limit or otherwise hamper the broad authority granted to the Attorney General under \u00a7 876(a). In-stead, \u00a7 876(c) was meant to give teeth to the Attorney General's authority by providing a mechanism to en- force subpoenas issued under \u00a7 876(a). And contrary to Ricco Jonas's contention, th e legislative history leads to the conclusion that the scope of \u00a7 876(c) is informed by the authority granted in \u00a7 876(a), not the other way around. See 101 Cong. Rec. 11683 (remarks of Rep. Cooper noting that the enforcement mechanism was meant to \"compel[ ] compliance with any summons is-sued pursuant to the authority granted\"). It is clear that Congress's intention was to facili- tate law enforcement investigations so that the goals of the CSA - \"to conquer drug abuse and to control the legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled sub-stances,\" Raich, 545 U.S. at 12 - could be accomplished. See United States v. Zadeh, 820 F.3d 746, 752 (5th Cir. 2016) (noting that because \"[f ]ederal control\" is \"essen-tial to the effective control of the interstate incidents of . . . traffic in controlled substances,\" the CSA \"grants the DEA broad enforcement power to prevent, detect, and investigate\" drug diversion into illegal channels) App. 27 (alterations in original). To interpret \u00a7 876 in a way that restricts law enforcement's authority to request records relevant to their investigations from states - who customarily maintain re cords of all controlled sub- stances distributed in their jurisdictions - would not only run afoul of the statutorily conferred broad au- thority, but would also be contrary to Congress's intent by significantly reverting law enforcement's investiga- tion capabilities to its pre -1955 situation. Because the language of \u00a7 876 of the CSA is identical in all relevant respects to that of Public Law 362 and the CSA is part of a comprehensive statut e that sought to \"enhance federal drug enforcement powers\" and \"strengthen law enforcement tools against the traffic in illicit drugs,\" Raich, 545 U.S. at 10, 12 (e mphasis added), it is clear that Congress could not have intended to revert law enforcement's investigation capabilities to its pre-1955 situation. See United States v. Hossbach, 518 F. Supp. 759, 767 (E.D. Pa. 1980) (noting that \"[e]ven though [the grant of subpoena powe r under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876] may be broader than that customarily granted to agen- cies by Congress, the preamble to the statute as to Con-gressional findings and declarations, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, makes clear that it was of grave concern to Congress that there should be effecti ve methods of dealing with illegal drug manufacturing and distribution\"). Ricco Jonas argues that the CSA \"uses the terms 'person' and 'State' throughout its statutory text differ- ently\" which, in her view, in dicates that the term \"per- son\" contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(c) does not include the State, its agencies, or its officials in their official App. 28 capacities. As an example, she cites 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 873, a provision requiring the Attorney General to \"cooperate with local, State, tribal, and Federal agencies concern- ing traffic in controlled substances.\" But that the CSA uses the more specific term \"State\" in some of its pro- visions for a more precise and coherent language does not mean that \"State\" cannot also be included within the meaning of \"person\" when such term is used in a way that encompasses several different terms, as used in \u00a7 876(c). 11 In fact, just like the CSA uses \"State\" as a less inclusive and more precise term than \"person\" in some provisions, it also uses the less inclusive and more precise term \"individuals\" in its text. See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 823(g)(1) (establishing that practitioners who dispense narcotic drugs to \"individuals\" for mainte- nance or detoxification treatme nts shall obtain a sepa- rate registration for that purpose). Yet, Ricco Jonas does not dispute that despit e the CSA's use of \"individ- uals\" throughout its statut ory text differently from \"person,\" the term \"person\" contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 contem- plates \"cooperative arrangements\" between the federal government and states, see id. \u00a7 873, \"not relationships 11 Moreover, a single statutory term may even \"take[ ] on 'dis- tinct characters' in distinct statutory provisions\" throughout a statute. Return Mail, Inc., 139 S. Ct. at 1863 (quoting Utility Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 320 (2014)). 12 Ricco Jonas urges us to adopt the Dictionary Act's defini- of \"person,\" ations, firms, partnerships, societ ies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals.\" See 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 (emphasis added). App. 29 where records will be seized via administrative inves- tigatory subpoena.\" But that Congress envisioned co- operation between the federal government and states does not mean that it intended the Attorney Gen-eral/DEA to hopelessly rely on the states' willingness to cooperate in order to obtain needed information to perform their congressionally assigned investigative function. Legislative history makes clear that Con- gress intended to \"strengthen law enforcement tools,\" Raich, 545 U.S. at 10, so t hat \"[t]he illegal traffic in drugs [c]ould be attacked with the full power of the Federal Government,\" H.R. Rep. No. 91-1444, at 4575 (1970) (emphasis added), not that law enforcement be at the mercy of the states ' willingness to cooperate. This very case exemplifies why it was important for Congress to provide the Attorney General/DEA with a mechanism to obtain records relevant to their investi- gations from states, its agencies, and its officials. Furthermore, contrary to Ricco Jonas's conten- tions, providing the Attorney General/DEA with a mechanism to enforce subpoenas does not render the cooperative arrangements provision meaningless. Sec- tion 873 of the CSA, titled \"Cooperative Arrange- ments,\" states that, \"[t]he Attorney General shall cooperate with local, State, tribal, and Federal agen- cies concerning traffic in co ntrolled substances and in suppressing the abuse of controlled substances.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 873(a). To this end, the Attorney General \"is authorized to . . . assist St ate, tribal, and local gov- ernments in suppressing th e diversion of controlled substances from legitimate medical, scientific, and App. 30 commercial channels.\" Id. \u00a7 873(a)(6). That the Attor- ney General/DEA may enforce administrative subpoe- nas issued to states, their agencies, or officials under \u00a7 876(c) for records relevant to their own investiga- tions relating to controlled substances in no way ham- pers the Attorney General' s authorization under \u00a7 873 to assist local, state, tribal, and federal agencies in their own fights against the illicit traffic of controlled substances. Nor does it hamper, as Ricco Jonas con- tends, the states' prerogative to conduct their own in-vestigations and prosecute drug offenses pursuant to applicable state laws. Finally, we note that our interpretation is con- sistent with the federal agen cy's interpretation of its statutory authority to issue administrative subpoenas for records relevant to its in vestigations, and, for aught that it appears, this is th e first time that a state has challenged this interpretat ion in court in the more than six decades that such authority has been in place. 13 See, e.g., Or. Prescription Drug Monitoring Pro- gram v. U.S. DEA, 860 F.3d 1228, 1236 (9th Cir. 2017) (stating, where the DEA issued an administrative sub-poena under \u00a7 876(a) to seek records from Oregon's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program - a state-main-tained database like the PDMP - that \"[t]he upshot of the statutory scheme is that the Attorney General can obtain testimony and documents through a subpoena and without a court order\" and that \"[a] court order is 13 The parties have not pointed us to any case addressing the statutory construction question presented here, nor has our inde-pendent research revealed such a case. App. 31 needed only in the event of noncompliance ('contumacy . . . in original) (citing 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 876(a) and (c))); see also Return Mail, Inc. , 139 S. Ct. at 1866 (stating that \"[w]hen administrative and judicial interpreta- tions have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provision, repetition of the same language in a new statute indicates, as a general matter, the intent to in- corporate its administrative and judicial interpreta- tions as well\") (quoting Brag don v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 645 (1998)). In light of the above, we find that the instant sub- poena is a legitimate exercise of authority under the CSA. Hence, the district co urt did not abus e its discre- tion in concluding that it was enforceable under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(c).14 C. The Privacy Interest in PDMP Data Ricco Jonas argues that, even if 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876 au- thorizes the issuance and en forcement of administra- tive subpoenas against states, their agencies, and officials in their official capacities, the Fourth Amend-ment nonetheless bars the enforcement of the instant subpoena. According to Ricco Jonas, individuals have a reasonable expectation of pri vacy in their prescription 14 On appeal, Ricco Jonas does not challenge the district court's conclusion that the CSA preempts New Hampshire's stat- utory requirement that law enforcement officials obtain an order based on probable cause before obtaining PDMP data. Hence, we do not address that issue. App. 32 drug records stored in the PDMP database, thereby al- lowing the DEA to obtain such records only with a court order based on probable cause. The parties dispute whether Ricco Jonas has standing to assert the substantive Fourth Amendment rights of the individual patient subject to the sub-poena. The district court assumed without deciding that Ricco Jonas had standin g. On appeal, Ricco Jonas and Amici argue in favor of standing, relying on the parens patriae doctrine and third-party standing, re- spectively. For its part, the DOJ argues that Fourth Amendment rights may not be invoked vicariously. Be-cause this is an issue of pru dential constraint, rather than Article III standing, we bypass the issue and di- rectly address the merits of the case. See Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 125 (2014) (explaining that the \"'prudential' branch of standing,\" which is \"not derived from Article III,\" in- cludes \"the general prohibition on a litigant's raising another person's legal rights\") (quoting Elk Grove Uni- fied School Dist. v. Newdo w, 542 U.S. 1, 12 (2004)); Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 509 (1975) (noting that the prudential standing rule \"normally bars litigants from asserting the ri ghts or legal interests of others in order to obtain relief from injury to themselves\"); Katz v. Pershing, LLC, 672 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 2012) (ex- plaining that prudential concerns \"ordinarily require a plaintiff to show that his claim is premised on his own legal rights (as opposed to th ose of a third party), that his claim is not merely a generalized grievance, and that it falls within the zo ne of interests protected by App. 33 the law invoked\") (quoting Pag\u00e1n v. Calder\u00f3n, 448 F.3d 16, 27 (1st Cir. 2006)); see also Gianfrancesco v. Town of Wrentham, 712 F.3d 634, 63 8 (1st Cir. 2013) (bypass- ing the prudential standing issue \"in favor of a more straightforward resolution on the merits\"). The Fourth Amendment applies when the person invoking its protection has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place to be searched or the item to be seized by governmental of ficials. Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 739-40 (1979); United States v. Battle, 637 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir. 2011). The Supreme Court has established a \"two-part test\" for analyzing whether a movant has a reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment. United States v. Rheault, 561 F.3d 55, 59 (1st Cir. 2009). Under this test, we must determine \"first, whether the movant has exhibited an actual, subjective, expectation of privacy; and second, whether such subjective expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as objectively reasonable.\" Id. (citing Smith, 442 U.S. at 740). Absent such an expec- tation, the government may use a subpoena to acquire records in its investigation without the need of a court order based on probable cause. See Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2222 (2018) (\"The Government will be able to use subpoenas to acquire records in the overwhelming majority of investigations. . . . [A] war- rant is required in the rare case where the suspect has a legitimate privacy interest in records held by a third party.\"). The DOJ argues that, contrary to Ricco Jonas's contentions, \"because of the closely regulated nature of App. 34 the pharmaceutical industry and the third-party doc- trine, a person cannot clai m an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy\" in his prescription drug records included in the PDMP database.15 We agree. The closely regulated industry doctrine recognizes that there is a diminished expectation of privacy for materials that are maintained by a business that is subject to pervasive regulation and inspection. 16 See Donovan v. Dewey, 452 U.S. 594, 600 (1981) (explain- ing that in a pervasively regulated business \"the fed- eral regulatory presence is sufficiently comprehensive and defined that the owner of commercial property cannot help but be aware th at his property will be subject to periodic inspections undertaken for specific purposes\"); New York v. Burger, 482 U.S. 691, 702 (1987) (explaining that \"[b] ecause the owner or oper- ator of commercial premise s in a 'closely regulated' industry has a reduced expe ctation of privacy,\" ad- ministrative searches and warrantless inspections \"may well be reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment\"); Giragosian v. Bettencourt, 614 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 2010) (validating the government's warrantless search of a licensed firearm dealer's inven- tory and records because \"the owner of commercial property in a closely regula ted industry has a reduced 15 The DOJ notes that, because the individual whose pre- scription records are being sought was not before the district court, it is impossible to determine whether such individual claims a privacy interest in those records. The DOJ thus focuses its argument on the objective part of the test. 16 Case law uses the terms \"closely regulated,\" \"highly regu- lated,\" and \"pervasively expectation of privacy in those premises\"). This court, as well as others, has characterized the pharmaceuti- cal industry as a closely regulated industry. United States v. Gonsalves, 435 F.3d 64, 67 (1st Cir. 2006); see also United States v. Schiffman, 572 F.2d 1137, 1142 (5th a 'per- vasively regulated business' like the liquor and gun in-dustries.\" (quoting United States v. Montrom, 345 F. Supp. 1337, (E.D.

Nechy, 827 F.2d 1161, 1166 (7th Cir. 1987); United States v. Motley, 443 F. Supp. 3d 1203, 1213 (D.

Utah Dep't of Commerce, No. 2:16-cv-611-DN-DBP, 2017 WL 3189868, at Utah July 27, 2017) (stat- ing that \"[p]rescription drugs are a highly regulated State v. Welch, 300 (Ohio 1992) (\"Being in such a pervasively regulated business, a pharmacist has a reduced expectation of privacy in the prescription records he or she keeps.\"). Both federal and New Hampshire laws regulate controlled substances by requiring pharmacies, among other handlers of controlled substances, to maintain App. 36 prescription drug records and keep them open for in- spection by law enforcement officers without the need of a warrant. The CSA and its implementing regulations pro- vide that every registered dispenser of a controlled substance must maintain a complete and accurate rec-ord of each such substance disposed of. 17 21 827(a)(3); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1304.0 3, 1304.04(h), 1304.21(a). These records must be kept for at least two years \"for inspection and copying by of ficers or employees of the United States authorized by the Attorney General.\" 21 U.S.C. (estab- lishing that all required records concerning controlled substances must be maintain ed for at least two years for inspection and copying by duly authorized DEA of-ficials). Similarly, New Hampshire law requires practi- tioners, including pharmacists, physicians, and hospi- tals, to maintain records \"show[ing] the receipt and disposition of all controlled drugs.\" N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 318-B:12(I). These records mu st comply with \"federal laws and regulations\" and mu st indicate at least: (1) the name, dosage form, strength, and quantity of the controlled drug; (2) the name and address of any per- son to whom the drug was administered, dispensed, sold or transferred; and (3 ) the date of any and all 17 The records of controlled substances maintained by regis- tered pharmacies shall include paper prescription records and electronic prescription records, which must be sortable by pre-scriber name, patient name, drug dispensed, and date filled. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1304.04(h).

Pursuant to New Hampshire law, every person or entity authorized to deliver schedule II-IV controlled substances must also report to the PDMP information about the dispensed drug, including the patient's name and address, the drug and quantity dispensed, and the date of dispensi ng.

City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001). But Ferguson was not about access to prescription drug records held by a third-party. Rather, there, the hospital, in conjunction with law enforcement, developed and foll owed a policy for identifying and testing preg- nant patients suspected of drug use. Under that policy, the hos-pital would take urine tests of pregnant women and provide positive results to the police. Ferguson, 532 U.S. at 70-73. The Supreme Court held that the hospital's performance of a diagnos-tic test to obtain incriminating evidence from their patients for App. 38 equate prescription drug reco rds to all other medical records. As a subset of medical records, prescription drug records do not generally or necessarily contain the more personal and intimate information that other medical records do. Medical records contain \"sensitive medical history and other information, including about mental illnesses, learning disabilities, birth defects, il-licit drug use, pregnancy terminations, domestic-vio- lence history,\" patients' complaints and symptoms, and \"the patients' family members,\" among others. Eil v. U.S. DEA, 878 F.3d 392, 396 (1st Cir. 2017). Further- more, unlike prescription drug records, medical rec-ords are not subject to pervas ive regulatory disclosures under both federal and state law. See U.S. Dep't of Jus- tice v. Utah Dep't of Commerce, No. 16-cv-00611-DN- DBP, 2017 (Pead, Mag.J.) (stating that \"the applicable legal frame- work suggests prescription drug records are highly regulated, and thus less deserving of privacy [than medical records]\"). Ricco Jonas also argues that individuals have a reasonable expectation of pri vacy in their prescription drug records stored in the PDMP database because \"prescription drug records are frequently suggestive of patients' underlying medica l diagnoses.\" But her ar- gument crumbles in the face of the pharmaceutical law enforcement purposes without the patients' consent was un- constitutional. Id. at 83-84. The Court noted that its ruling did not extend to a situation \"in which state hospital employees, like other citizens, may have a duty to provide law enforcement offi-cials with evidence of criminal co nduct acquired in the course of routine treatment.\" Id. at 78 n.13. App. 39 industry's regulatory requirements. Both New Hamp- shire and federal law require that practitioners and handlers of controlled subst ances (including pharma- cies and pharmacists) maintain records containing es-sentially the same information stored in the PDMP database and keep such records available for law en- forcement inspection without the need of a court order. The PDMP merely aggregates into one depository the information included in records that must already be maintained available and open for inspection by the DEA. Ricco Jonas does not discuss why we should find a reasonable expectation of privacy in the aggregated database records when the underlying individual rec-ords containing essentially the same information are open to on-site inspection by law enforcement. And case law suggests we should not. See Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 600-04 (1977) (holding that New York's collection of prescription reco rds in a computerized da- tabase did not violate patients ' and physicians' right to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the Four- teenth Amendment). We thus find that, in light of the intense govern- ment scrutiny to which prescription drug records are subject and the availability of those records for inspec-tion without the need of court intervention under both state and federal law, a person does not have a reason- able expectation that the information contained in pre-scription drug records will be kept private and free of government intrusion. See Motley, 443 F. Supp. 3d at 1213 (reasoning that, because the pharmaceutical in- dustry is highly regulated and \"is required by federal App. 40 law to keep the types of reco rds sought by [law enforce- ment] in [that] case, [defend ant] did not have a reason- able expectation of privacy in the [Prescription Monitoring *8-9 (holding that, be- cause \"patients do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the highly regulated prescription drug in-dustry,\" the Fourth Amendment posed no bar to en- forcement of subpoena issued by the DEA to obtain records from the state-maintained database); Murphy v. State, 62 P.3d 533, 541 (Wash. Ct. App. 2003) (\"Given [the] long history of government scrutiny, patients who fill prescriptions for narcotic drugs . . . should reason-ably expect that their prescri ptions will be available to appropriate government agents.\"). In fact, the expecta- tion created by the intense regulatory requirements is that \"prescription and use of controlled substances will happen under the watchful eye of [both] the federal [and state] WL 3189868, at *8. Our conclusion that patients do not have a reason- able expectation of privacy in their prescription drug records is further supported by the third-party doc- trine. Under that doctrine, a person has no legitimate expectation of pri- vacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties . . . even if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the confi-dence placed in the third party will not be be- trayed. App. 41 United States v. Morel, 922 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir. 2019) (citing Smith, 442 U.S. at 743-44) (quotation marks omitted). This doctrine \"largely tra ces its roots to [United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435 (1976)].\" Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2216. In Miller, the Supreme Court applied the third-party doctrine in rejecting a bank customer's claim of a reasonable expectation of privacy in his fi- nancial records held by the bank. Miller, 425 U.S. at 436-45. The Court noted that the records subpoenaed were business records and not Miller's \"private papers\" and that they contained information \"exposed to [bank] employees in the ordinary course of business.\" Id. at 440, 442. The Court thus concluded that Miller had \"take[n] the risk, in revealing his affairs to an- other, that the information [wo uld] be conveyed by that person to the Government.\" Id. at 443. The Court ap- plied the same logic to dialed phone numbers in Smith v. Maryland, where it held that, \"[w]hen he used his phone, petitioner voluntarily conveyed numerical in- formation to the telephone company and 'exposed' that information to its equipment in the ordinary course of business. In so doing, petit ioner assumed the risk that the company would reveal to police the numbers he di-aled.\" 442 U.S. at 744. Ricco Jonas, however, resists the application of the third-party doctrine. Relying on Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018), where the Supreme Court declined to extend the third-party doctrine to cell-site location information, Ricco Jonas claims that such doctrine is not applic able here because patients App. 42 do not turn over prescription records voluntarily inas- much as the only way to av oid such sharing is by for- going medical treatment or filling their prescriptions in another state. But Carpenter is of no help to Ricco Jonas. Car- penter did not disturb the third-party doctrine. Car- penter, 138 S. Ct. at 2220 (\"We do not disturb the application of Smith and Miller .\"). Rather, it reiterated that two primary rationa les underlie the third-party doctrine: the nature of the information sought and the voluntariness of the exposure of that information to third parties. Id. at 2219-20. Based on these rationales, the Court refused to apply the third-party doctrine in that case because doing so would amount to \"a signifi- cant extension of [the doctrine] to a distinct category of information.\" Id. at 2219. In considering the nature of the information sought, the Supreme Court noted in Carpenter that cell-site location information provides an \"all-encompassing holder's whereabouts[,] . . . revealing not only his particular movements, but through them his 'familial, political, professional, reli- gious, and sexual associations.' \" Id. at 2217 (quoting United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400, 415 (2012) (So- tomayor, J., concurring)). In essence, it amounts to a \"detailed chronicle of a person 's physical presence com- piled every day, every moment, over several years.\" Id. at 2220. In the Court's view, because the personal in-formation that law enforcement can get from cell-site records is not limited like th e information at issue in App. 43 Miller and Smith, it \"implic ates privacy concerns far beyond those considered in [those two cases].\" Id. Here, Ricco Jonas argues that prescription drug records contain intimate and private details because it may be possible to determine a person's illnesses from looking at such records, thus suggesting that the nature of the documents sought should cut against applying the third-party doctrine. But the nature of prescription drug records is si milar to that of bank rec- ords, and much different t han that at issue in Carpen- ter. See id. at 2219 (\"There is a world of difference between the limited types of personal information ad- dressed in Smith and Miller and the exhaustive chron- icle location information cas ually collected by wireless carriers today.\"). Even though financial transactions can reveal personal information, such as \"personal affairs, opinions, habits,\" \"a person's activities, U.S. at 451, 453 (Bren- nan, J., dissenting), the Supreme Court characterized this type of personal information as \"limited.\" Carpen- ter, 138 S. Ct. at 2219. The personal information that law enforcement could get from prescription drug rec- ords is likewise limited. At most, law enforcement could possibly decipher a patient's diagnosis or several potential diagnoses. This is thus more akin to the in- formation at issue in Miller than to the \"all-encom- passing record\" and \"detailed chronicle\" that may be ascertained from cell-site records. Id. at 2217, 2220. Furthermore, the records subpoenaed by the DEA are not the patient's \"private papers.\" Miller, 425 U.S. at 440. A physician does not wr ite a prescription for the App. 44 patient to keep to himself. Instead, the prescription is meant to be turned over to a drug dispenser in the or- dinary course of business wi th instructions of what drug, what dosage and frequency, and to whom the controlled substance should be dispensed. See United States v. Gayden, 977 F.3d 1146, 1152 (11th Cir. 2020) (finding that disclosure of prescription drug records was voluntary because prescriptions \"were, by their very nature, intended to be revealed to others when they were disclosed . . . to the pharmacies which filled them\"). Prescription drug records are kept by the phar- macy or dispensary and subsequently shared with the PDMP, and the patient has no access to those records or control over them. Nor does the second rationale underlying the third-party doctrine - voluntary exposure - help Ricco Jonas. In Carpenter, the Supreme Court noted that a cell phone logs a cell-site record by dint of its operation, without any affirmative act on the part of the user beyond powering up. Vir-tually any activity on the . . the phone from the net-work, there is no way to avoid leaving behind a trail of location data. Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2220. Ricco Jonas argues that, like the cell phone user in Carpenter, patients do not voluntarily share their prescription drug information with third parties. She submits that obtaining health care and drug treatment therapies is \"indispensable to participation in modern society\" and apart from App. 45 forgoing health care and drug treatment therapies, there is no way to avoid leaving behind prescription drug data. Thus, in her view, in no meaningful sense does a patient voluntarily assume the risk of turning over prescription drug data. But the Supreme Court rejected a similar argument in Miller. There, Miller ar- gued that \"[f ]or all practical purposes, the disclosure by individuals or business firms of their financial af- fairs to a bank is not entirely volitional, since it is im- possible to participate in the economic life of contemporary society without maintaining a bank ac- count.\" Brief for Respondent, United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435 (1976) (No. 74-1179), 1975 WL 173642, at *8; see also Miller, 425 U.S. at 451 (Brennan, J., dis- senting) (adopting this argument). Unpersuaded, the Court found that this does not change the fact that the person affirmatively elected to turn over the document to a third party and, in so d oing, \"t[ook] the risk\" that the information be conveyed by that third party to the government. Miller, 425 U.S. at 443. Similarly, a person who turns over his prescription for controlled sub-stances to a third party \"a ssume[s] the risk\" (in this case the certainty, given the state and federal disclo- sure requirements), that the information be turned over to the government. Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2220. In sum, an analysis of th e two rationales underly- ing the third-party doctrine lead us to conclude that the third-party doctrine ap plies to this case. See Gayden, 977 F.3d at 1152 (holding that \"prescription records are third-party material\" that may be obtained by law enforcement without a warrant). As the Court App. 46 noted in Carpenter, \"society's expectation has been that law enforcement agents . . . would not - and in- deed, in the main, simply could not - secretly monitor and catalogue every single movement of an individ-ual's car for a very long period.\" Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2217 (quotation marks omitted). In the Court's view, allowing the government to be nefit from \"seismic shifts in digital technology\" t hat now makes possible the \"tireless and absolute surveillance\" of individuals \"at practically no expense\" would contravene that expec-tation. Id. at 2218-19. Here, in contrast, there is no \"powerful new tool,\" id. at 2223, that makes possi ble for law enforcement to now do what it could not do before. Although it may be easier and cheaper for law enforcement to obtain pre-scription drug records from the PDMP than from indi- vidual pharmacies, society's expectation has been for decades that law enforcement would have access to prescription drug records and would closely monitor the prescription and use of controlled substances. Finally, Ricco Jonas argues that finding no reason- able expectation of privacy in prescription drug records may cause people to forgo treatment to maintain their privacy. But in Whalen the Supreme Court rejected a similar argument under the Fourteenth Amendment and Ricco Jonas offers no explanation for why the same reasoning should not apply under the Fourth Amend- ment. See Whalen, 429 U.S. at 602-04 (finding no inva- sion of privacy right pro tected by the Fourteenth Amendment despite the fact that \"some individuals' concern for their own privacy may lead them to avoid App. 47 or to postpone needed medical attention\" because of fear that public disclosure of this information \"may re- flect unfavorably on the[ir] character\"). IV. CONCLUSION In light of the above, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in enforcing the instant ad- ministrative subpoena. The district court's judgment is thus affirmed.

App. 52 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE United States Department of Justice v. Michelle Ricco Jonas Case No. 18-mc-56-LM REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION (Filed Nov. 1, 2018) Before the court is the United States Department of Justice's (DOJ) petition to compel compliance with an administrative subpoena the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) issued to Michelle Ricco Jonas, manager of the New Hampshire Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP). Doc. no. 1. The dis- trict judge ordered Jonas to show cause why she should not be compelled to obey the subpoena and produce cer-tain PDMP records. The judge referred the matter to the undersigned magistrate judge for a recommended disposition. Doc. no. 3. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B); LR 72.1. After reviewing the parties' submissions and hearing their arguments, the court recommends that the district judge grant the petition. I. Legal Standard \"The requirements for enforcement of an adminis- trative subpoena are not onerous.\" United States v. Sturm Ruger & Co, 84 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1996). The court will enforce the subpoena if the agency proves App. 53 that: (1) the subpoena is issued for a congressionally authorized purpose, the information sought is (2) rele- vant to the authorized purpose and (3) adequately de- scribed, and (4) proper procedures have been employed in issuing the subpoena. Id. \"As long as the agency sat- isfies these modest requirements, the subpoena is per se reasonable and Fourth Amendment concerns are deemed satisfied.\" Id. (citing Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. v. Walling, 327 U.S. 186, 208 (1946)). \"The role of a court in a subpoena enforcement proceeding is strictly lim- ited to inquiring whether the above requirements have been met. 'Such proceedings are designed to be sum- mary in nature.' \" United States v. Comley, 890 F.2d 539, 541 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting EEOC v. Tempel Steel Co., 814 F.2d 482, 485 (7th Cir. 1987)). \"[A]ffidavits of government officials have been accepted as sufficient to make out a prima facie showing that these require- ments are satisfied.\" Id. II. Background1 Pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the Attorney General is authorized to issue adminis- trative subpoenas to investigate suspected criminal drug activity. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(a). The Attorney General has delegated that authority to the DEA. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.100. The subpoena power extends to \"requir[ing] the production of any records (including books, papers, documents, and other tangible things which constitute 1 The facts are drawn from the parties' filings. They are un- disputed unless indicated otherwise. App. 54 or contain evidence) which the Attorney General finds relevant or material to\" any investigation being con- ducted pursuant to the CSA. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(a). The CSA permits subpoenas to be served on natural per-sons by personal delivery. Id. \u00a7 876(b). The CSA further provides that \"[i]n the case of contumacy by or refusal to obey a subp[o]ena issued to any person,\" the federal court has jurisdiction to compel compliance. Id. \u00a7 876(c). The New Hampshire Board of Pharmacy operates the PDMP. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 318-B:33, I. All \"pre- scribers and dispensers\" of certain controlled sub-stances are required to submit information to the PDMP database, including the patient's name and ad- dress and the type, quantity and refill regimen of the prescribed substance. Id. \u00a7 318-B:33, IV (a)-(o). Infor- mation the PDMP gathers is confidential and can be released for research and educational purposes if the data is \"de-identified.\" Id. \u00a7 318-B:34. As particularly relevant here, the PDMP can release information to \"authorized law enforcement officials . . . for the pur-pose of investigation and prosecution of a criminal of- fense when presented with a court order based on probable cause.\" Id. \u00a7 318-B:35, I(a)(3). On June 13, 2018, the DEA served a subpoena on Ricco Jonas which requested all PDMP records per-taining to a particular individual dating back to Feb- ruary 2016. 2 Subpoena, doc. no. 1-3. Ricco Jonas, 2 The DEA first served the subpoena naming PDMP. The New Hampshire Attorney General objected on the ground that App. 55 represented by the New Hampshire Attorney General, objected to providing the requested information. Galdieri Ltr., doc. no. 1-2. The instant petition followed. III. Analysis Ricco Jonas claims that the petition \"is nothing more than an attempt to circumvent federal law,\" Def. Obj., doc. no. 7, at 3, and asserts several grounds for denial. The court addresses them in turn. A. Threshold burden Ricco Jonas first argues that the DOJ has failed to meet its burden of showing t hat its investigation has a legitimate authorized purpose. Id. DEA Investigator Stern's declaration doc. no . 8-1, persuades the court that DOJ has met these \"modest requirements.\"3 Sturm Ruger & Co, 84 F.3d at 4. She states that the New Hampshire Board of Pharmacy provided her with information \"regarding the potential diversion of large amounts of opiates through pharmacies\" in New Hampshire. Id. \u00b6 2. Investig ator Stern stated further the PDMP was not a \"person\" within the meaning of the CSA. Without conceding the point, the DEA nevertheless subsequently served the subpoena naming Ricco Jonas. 3 The DOJ asserts that it appended Stern's declaration to its reply memorandum, rather than its original petition, because Ricco Jonas raised this threshold argument for the first time in her objection to the Petition, rather than in the letter announcing her refusal to comply with the su bpoena. Reply. Mem., doc no. 8, at 2 n.1. The court takes no issue with the timing of the submis-sion. App. 56 that \"an individual [was] reported to be filling fraudu- lent prescriptions for . . . control[led] substances which he receives from out-of-state practitioners in New Hampshire.\" Id. \"The main objectives of the CSA were to conquer drug abuse and to control the legitimate and illegiti-mate traffic in controlled substances. Congress was particularly concerned with the need to prevent the di- version of drugs from legitimate to illicit channels.\" Gonzalez v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 12-13 (2005) (footnotes omitted). Given this mand ate and the Attorney Gen- eral's authority under 21 U. S.C. \u00a7 876(a) to \"require production of any records . . . which the Attorney Gen- eral finds relevant or material to the investigation,\" the court has little trouble finding that the DOJ has proven that the subpoena is relevant to a congression- ally authorized purpose, the information sought is adequately described and DEA followed proper proce-dures. Sturm Ruger & Co., 84 F.3d at 4. Ricco Jonas does not contest the adequacy of the DOJ's evidence on this issue. B. Suit against the St ate of New Hampshire Ricco Jonas next asserts that the subpoena cannot be enforced because it was issued to her in her official capacity as PDMP Progra m Manager, rather than in her personal capacity. This distinction, she argues, has significant ramifications. Ricco Jonas contends that such an \"official capacity\" subpoena is the equivalent of an action against the State of New Hampshire. And, App. 57 she argues, because the State is not a \"person\" under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(c), the subpoena is unenforceable. Def. Mem., doc no. 7, at 13. Ricco Jonas's argument found- ers on the initial premise - that DOJ has sued the State by serving her with a subpoena. As will be ex- plained in more detail below, the court finds that this action is not a suit against the State. Ricco Jonas has cited no authority for her proposi- tion that her being served because of her position as PDMP manager converts this subpoena enforcement action into a suit against the State of New Hampshire. Indeed, the weight of pers uasive authority is against her. Generally speaking, \"[f ]ederal subpoenas rou- tinely issue to state and federal employees to produce official records or appear and testify in court and are fully enforceable despite any claim of immunity.\" United States v. Juvenile Male 1, 431 F. Supp. 2d 1012, 1016 (D. Ariz. 2006). Although the First Circuit Court of Appeals has not addressed the precise issue Ricco Jonas raises, another district court in this Circuit has recently observed that a motion to compel non-party discovery from a state agency is not a suit against the state because it \"will not result in a judgment of any kind requiring financial payment from the state.\" United States v. Univ. of. Mass., 167 F. Supp. 2d 221, 225 (D. Mass. 2016). In reachi ng this conclusion, the court relied on Allen v. Wood ford, 544 F. Supp. 2d 1074 (E.D. Cal. 2008), adopting rep. and rec., 543 F. Supp. 2d 1138. In Allen, a prison inmate sought document pro- duction from several state agencies under the Federal App. 58 Rules of Civil Procedure. Id. at 1075. The agencies claimed Eleventh Amendment immunity. Id. The court defined the \"threshold issue [as] whether issuance and required compliance with a third-party subpoena by State custodians of records in an action in which the State is not a party consti tutes\" a suit against the state. Id. at 1078. The cou rt concluded that the sub- poena was not a suit. Id. Several aspects of the Allen court's reasoning are instructive here. First, the court observed that discov- ery from a state agency can only be obtained through the custodians of records or \"other employees having custody and control of the information or documents sought.\" Id. at 1079. In this case, the DEA served the subpoena on Ricco Jonas because, as her counsel con- ceded at oral argument, she has custody and control over PDMP information. Next, the Allen court re- marked that: Neither the State, nor any of its employees to whom subpoenas have been directed to obtain the information sought, that have been found essential to the prosecution of the Plaintiff 's case, are parties, nor has any relief in law or equity been sought against them or the State. No judgment will be issued in this action against the State that could have any conceiv-able effect on the State treasury; the State custodians are only subpoenaed to produce documents for use in the prosecution of this federal civil rights action. The Non-Parties' assertion that they must comply with the subpoenas in their official capacities as App. 59 custodians of record is irrelevant; no judg- ment or other relief of any kind is sought against them in this litigation. Id. (emphasis added). The Allen court also cited two cases that further persuade the court that this a ction is not a suit against the State. First, in Florida Dept. of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U.S. 670 (1982), the plurality ap- proved service of process on st ate officials in possession of certain artifacts. Rejecting the state's immunity ar- gument, the Court declared that \"[i]t is clear that the process at issue was directed only at state officials and not at the State itself or any agency of the State.\" Id. at 691. The Court concluded: \"Treasure Salvors is not asserting a claim for damages against either the State of Florida or its officials. . . . The relief sought is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\" Id. at 699. Allen also cited with approval Laxalt v. C.K. McClatchy, 109 F.R.D. 632 (D. Nev. 1986), a libel suit in which the district court rejected a Nevada gaming agency's claim that the Eleventh Amendment barred compliance with a federal subpoena. Id. at 633. The Laxalt court first noted that only assertions of liability and claims for relief against the state are considered to be \"lawsuits against a st ate.\" Id. at 634. It then found the case's similarity to Treasure Salvors, Inc., dispositive, because \"inspection and copying of state records is all that is being sought. . . .\" Id. at 634-35. Other cases have employed the same analysis and reached the same result. See, e.g., Jackson v. AFSCME App. 60 Local 196, No. 3:07CV0471(JCH), 2008 WL 1848900, at *2 (D. Conn. Apr. 25, 2008) (finding that subpoena on state agency official was not an action against the state); Arista Records LLC v. Does 1-14, No. 7:08cv00205, 2008 5350246, at *5 (W.D. 22, 2008) (same; citing Jackson). Ultimately, Ricco Jonas's argument that the State of New Hampshire is not a \"person,\" within the mean- ing of the CSA begs the question of whether DOJ has initiated a suit against the State merely by naming her and her title in the subpoena. Given the one-sided au- thority that Ricco Jonas has not contradicted, the court finds that her assertion that she \"must comply with the subpoenas in [her] official ca pacity[y] as custodians of record is irrelevant.\" Allen, 544 F. Supp. 2d at 1079. \"[I]nspection and copying of st ate records is all that is being sought. . . .\" Laxalt, 109 F.R.D. at 634-35. This ac- tion is not a suit against the State of New Hampshire. The court therefore need not reach the question of whether the State is a \"person\" within the meaning of the CSA.4 4 DOJ also relies on Ott v. Ci ty of Milwaukee, 682 F.3d 552, 556 (7th Cir. 2012) in which the court rejected an immunity de- fense in a discovery dispute. Ott, however, is inapposite, as it re- lied on federal discovery rules definitions to find that a city agency was a \"person.\" By contrast, this case involves a federal statute. Also misplaced is Ricco Jonas's reliance on Al Fayed v. CIA, 229 F.3d 272 (D.C. Cir. 2000), in which the Court held that the CIA is not a \"person\" within the meanin g 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782, which gives district courts power to order a person to produce documents for use in foreign or international tr ibunals. Id. at 275-76. Al Fayed, however, involved a federal discovery subpoena served on a App. 61 C. Supremacy Clause Ricco Jonas next argues that DOJ must demon- strate probable cause to seiz e the PDMP records as re- quired by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 318-B:35(I)(b)(3). This argument fails because the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution preempts the provisions of New Hamp- shire law upon which Ricco Jonas relies. Under the Supremacy Clause, state laws that \"interfere with, or are contrary to the laws of [C]ongress\" are invalid. U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. Unless Congress directs otherwise, the Supremacy Clause preempts state laws which are in conflict with federal law. Hillman v. Maretta, 569 U.S. 483, 490 (2013). Such co nflicts exist when a state law \"stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Con- gress.\" Wisconsin Pub. Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U.S. 597 (1991) (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52 (1941)). \"If the purpose of the [federal] act . . . must be frustrated and its provisions be refused their natural effect,\" then a conflict exists. Savage v. Jones, 225 U.S. 501, 533 (1912). Several courts have invoked the Supremacy Clause in enforcing administrative subpoenas issued under the CSA. As especially relevant here, three of those cases involved pre scription drug databases similar to the NH PDMP. For example, in Oregon federal agency in private litigation, not, as here, an administra- tive subpoena served by a federal agency on a state-agency record custodian. Regardless, because the court finds that this action is not a \"suit\" against the State, it does not reach the issue of whether the State is a \"person\" under the CSA. App. 62 Prescription Drug Monitoring Program v. U.S. Drug Enforcement Admin., 860 F.3d 1228 (9th Cir. 2017) the court held that the CSA preempted an Oregon statute requiring \"a valid court order\" before that state's PDMP could comply with a DEA subpoena. Id. at 1236. The Court observed that the \"Oregon statute stands as an obstacle to the full implementation of the CSA be-cause it interferes with th e methods by which the fed- eral statute was designed to reach [its] goal.\" Id. (citing Gade v. Nat'l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass'n, 505 U.S. 88, 103 (1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Simi- larly, in United States Dep 't of Justice v. Utah Dep't of Commerce, No. 2:16-cv-611, 2017 WL 3189868 (D. Utah July 27, 2017), the court, relying on the Suprem- acy Clause, found that the CSA preempted the state's requirement of a warrant to access a state prescription database. Id. at *6. Also, in United States Dep't of Jus- tice v. Colo. Bd. Of Pharm, Civ. No. 10-cv-0116-WYD- MEH, 2010 WL 3547898 (D. Colo. Aug. 13, 2010), rep. and rec. aff 'd and adopted, 2010 WL 3547896 (Sept. 3, 2010), the court addressed a DEA subpoena issued to the Colorado PDMP seeking information about three prescription prescribers. The PDMP did not comply, ar- guing that a Colorado statute only allowed the release information related to pat ients. After observing that the state statute would require the DEA to individu- ally review the records of hundreds of pharmacies to find information on three prescribers, the court found that the state statute was an \"obstacle to the DEA's efforts to conduct its investig ation,\" id. at *4, and that the CSA therefore preempted the state restriction. Id.; see also United States v. Mich. Dep't of Cmty. Health, App. 63 No. 1:10-mc-109, 2011 WL 2412602 (W.D. Mich. June 9, 2011) (enforcing DEA subp oena seeking information from state medical marijuana database despite state confidentiality provision). Courts have also relied on the Supremacy Clause to uphold administrative subpoenas in other contexts. See, e.g., Presly v. United States, 895 F.3d 1284 (8th Cir. 2018) (rejecting argume nt that Florida Constitu- tion's privacy provisions can affect Internal Revenue Service's ability to subpoe na bank records); United States ex rel. Office of In spector Gen. v. Philadelphia Hous. 382765, at Feb. 4, 2011) (rejecting city housing author- ity's reliance on state privacy laws because they \"ob- struct fulfillment\" of an administrative subpoena issued by the Officer of Inspector General of the De- partment of Housing and Urban Development); Mas- 2001 WL 1518137, at *1 (W.D.N.Y. Nov. 7, 2001) (finding that defendant must comply with Social Secu- rity Commissioner's administrative subpoena despite privacy provisions of New York law); St. Luke's Reg'l Med. Ctr., Inc. v. United States, 717 F. Supp. 665, 666 (N.D. Iowa 1989) (rejecting doctor's reliance on state disclosure prohibitions to avoid complying with De- partment of Health and Human Services administra- tive subpoena in Medicaid investigation). Given the consistent weight of authority, the court is persuaded that giving e ffect to New Hampshire's re- quirement of a court order based on probable cause would create \"an obstacle to the full implementation of App. 64 the CSA because it interferes with the methods by which the federal statute was designed to reach [its] goal.\" Oregon Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, 860 F.3d at 1236. The stat e statute is therefore preempted and must give way to the CSA's subpoena process. D. Fourth Amendment Even if New Hampshire's warrant requirement is pre-empted, Ricco Jonas argues that DOJ must never-theless satisfy the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. 5 Ricco Jonas asserts both the State's and other in- dividuals' Fourth Amendment privacy interests in the 5 Ricco Jonas also contends that the DOJ, apparently fearful of her argument that the State of New Hampshire is not a \"per-son\" under the CSA, is now claiming that it served her in her individual capacity. In that capacity, she argues, she can only comply with the subpoena by violating state law because, in her personal capacity, she has no legal right to the information.\" Def. Obj., doc. no. 7, at 9. As the co urt has already concluded, however, the official capacity/personal capacity analysis is irrelevant here. Moreover, the court does not interpret the DOJ's argument in the manner Ricco Jonas suggests. The CSA allows service on a \"natural person,\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(b), and allows court to \"any person.\" Id. \u00a7 876(c). \"If a party is going to subpoena documents from the government, they need to subpoena the person who has possession, custody, or control over the documents. . . .\" United States v. 2121 Celeste Road SW, N.M., 307 F.R.D. 572, 590-91 (D.N.M. 2015) (em- phasis added). Ricco Jonas does not dispute that she is that person. Def. Obj., doc. no. 7, at 6 (citing N.H. Admin. R. Ph. 1505.03(c)). App. 65 personal information PDMP possesses. DOJ argues that Rico Jonas does not have standing to raise this argument on others' behalf. The standing issue is not dispositive. Assuming without deciding that Ricco Jonas does have standing - either in her own right or on behalf of others - the Court of Appeals has held that \"Fourth Amendment concerns are deemed satisfied\" if the agency proves that the subpoena seeks information relevant to an authorized purpose, is adequately de- scribed and was issued in accordance with proper pro-cedures. Sturm Ruger, 84 F.3d at 4; see also United States v. Tivian Labs., Inc., 589 F.2d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 1978) (\"A subpoena may be issued without first obtain- ing a court's permission . . . and may be judicially en- forced without a showing that probable, or even reasonable, cause exists to believe that a violation of law has occurred.\") (citation omitted). As previously noted, supra, p. 6, DOJ has already cleared this hurdle. But that is not the end of the inquiry. As the Su-preme Court recently observed, \"[t]he Government will be able to use subpoenas to acquire records in the over-whelming majority of investigations\" but \"a warrant is required in the rare case where the suspect has a legit- imate privacy interest in records held by a third party.\" Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2222 (2018). In Carpenter, the Court found that the criminal defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in \"cell-site location information \" that ostensibly tracked his whereabouts based on information retrieved from cell phone towers. Accordingly, it found that the gov-ernment could not use a court order authorized by the App. 66 Stored Communications Act which required only \"rea- sonable grounds,\" rather than probable cause, to re- trieve the information. Id. at 2222-23; see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703(d). Here, however, the patients whose interests Ricco Jonas advances do not have such a reasonable expectation of privacy. Ricco Jonas relies on two cases for the proposition that patients have a Fourth Amendment-based expec- tation of privacy in their prescription drug records and that DOJ must therefore demonstrate probable cause. See Douglas v. Dobbs, 419 F.3d 1097, 1102 (10th Cir. Auth., 72 F.3d 1133, 1138 (3d Cir. 1995). But neither case supports the weight that Ricco Jonas places up on them. While both noted the patient's privacy interest in prescription infor-mation, both also noted that the right is \"not absolute.\" Douglas, 419 F.3d at 1102 n.3; Doe, 72 F.3d at 1138. See also Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 602 (1977) (holding that patients' expectation of privacy in their prescrip-tion drug use must be weig hed against the state's in- terest in monitoring the use of controlled substances). Moreover, Dobbs explicitly declined to resolve the issue of whether a warrant is required to conduct an inves-tigatory search of prescription records, finding only that, for purposes of a qualifi ed immunity analysis, the issue was unsettled. 419 F.3d at 1103; see also, Pyle v. Woods, 874 F.3d 1257, 1264 (10th Cir. 2017) (observing that as of April 2013 \"no court had conducted the nec- essary analysis and no judicial opinion held that a war- rantless search of a prescription drug database by state law enforcement officials is unconstitutional.\"). App. 67 Ultimately, Rico Jonas cites no case holding that the Fourth Amendment requires DOJ to obtain a war- rant to secure information from a state prescription database and the only case to directly address the is-sue has held that the DEA may access state prescrip- tion databases without a warrant. In Utah Dep't of Commerce, supra, the court enforced a DEA subpoena issued to the Utah equivalent of the PDMP. The court's reasoning is persuasive. It first noted that \"the phar- maceutical industry, like the mining, firearms, and liq-uor industries, is a pervasively regulated industry and that consequently pharmacists and distributors sub- ject to the [CSA] have a reduced expectation of privacy in the records kept in comp liance with the [CSA].\" Id. at *8 (quoting United States v. Acklen, 690 F.2d 70, 75 (6th Cir. 1982)); see also New York v. Burger, 482 U.S. 691, 702 (1987) (\"Because the owner or operator of commercial premises in a 'closely regulated' industry has a reduced expectation of privacy, the warrant and probable-cause requirements, which fulfill the tradi- tional Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness for a government search . . . have lessened application in this context.\"). The CSA, the court concluded, cre- ated the expectation that \"the prescription and use of controlled substances will happen under the watchful eye of the federal government.\" Id. Next, the court observed that the Utah prescrip-tion database's mandatory report ing requirements further eroded patients' claimed right to privacy. In trusting a prescribing physician with health infor-mation, \"a patient takes the risk - in this App. 68 circumstance, a certainty - that his or her information will be conveyed to the government as required by the Database Act.\" Id. (citing United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 443 (1976) (holding that the Fourth Amend- ment does not bar the government from obtaining in- formation \"revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to Government authorities, even if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the confidence placed in the third party will not be betrayed.\")). As a result, the Court found, the mandatory reporting requirement \"means the State already has decided that any individ- ual right to privacy in one's prescription drug records is outweighed by a countervailing interest in the gov- ernment monitoring the prescriptions for unlawful or improper use,\" id., and that \"physicians and patients have no reasonable expectation of privacy from the DEA in the Utah database.\" Id. The Utah Dep't of Commerce court's reasoning is an appropriate fit for this case. While New Hampshire law treats PDMP information as confidential, see N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 318-B:34, I, it also makes clear that program information about a patient can be disclosed \"to others who are authorized by state or federal law\" to receive such information. Id. In addition, the law al- lows the PDMP to provide in formation to a variety of entities, including state medical boards and other states' prescription safety programs. See id., \u00a7 318- B:35, I-III. Ricco Jonas argues that the holding in Utah Dep't of Commerce is contrary to the Tenth Circuit Court of App. 69 Appeals's declaration in Do bbs, that patients have a right to privacy in their prescription drug records. But as previously noted, Dobbs c autioned that that right is not absolute. In addition, Dobbs presciently observed that \"state law can operat e to diminish the privacy expectation in prescription drug records.\" 419 F.3d at 1102 n.3. New Hampshire law has done exactly that. To the extent that Ricco Jonas has standing to assert their claims, patients do not have a reasonable expec- tation of privacy in the records maintained by the PDMP. IV. Conclusion The court agrees with the government's view that \"Ricco simple compli- Gov. Rep., doc no. 8, at 1. The CSA authorizes the court to enforce subpoenas issued to \"any person.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(c). The government has met its burden to satisfy the \"modest requirements\" for enforcement. \"The State has, admirably, placed considerable controls and precautions on [PDMP] access. The determination that a[n] [order supported by probable cause] is re- quired of . . . State and local law enforcement officers . . . is within the State's authority. But the State's at- tempt to regulate federal law enforcement fails.\" Utah Dep't of Commerce, 2017 WL 3189868 at *9 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).

From Title 21 - FOOD AND DRUGS CHAPTER 13 - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL Subchapter I - CONTRO L AND ENFORCEMENT Part A - Introductory Provisions \u00a7801. Congressional findings and declarations: controlled substances The Congress makes the following findings and decla- rations: (1) Many of the drugs included within this sub- chapter have a useful and legitimate medical purpose and are necessary to maintain the health and general welfare of the American people. (2) The illegal importation , manufacture, distri- bution, and possession and improper use of controlled substances have a substantial and detrimental effect on the health and general welfare of the American peo-ple. App. 75 (3) A major portion of the traffic in controlled substances flows through interstate and foreign com- merce. Incidents of the traffic which are not an integral part of the interstate or fo reign flow, such as manufac- ture, local distribution, and possession, nonetheless have a substantial and direct effect upon interstate commerce because\u2014 (A) after manufacture, many controlled sub- stances are transported in interstate commerce, (B) controlled substances distributed locally usually have been transported in inter- state commerce immediately before their distribution, and (C) controlled substances possessed com- monly flow through interstate commerce immediately prior to such possession. (4) Local distribution and possession of con- trolled substances contribute to swelling the interstate traffic in such substances. (5) Controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate cannot be differentiated from controlled substances manuf actured and distributed interstate. Thus, it is not feasible to distinguish, in terms of controls, between controlled substances man- ufactured and distributed interstate and controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate. (6) Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the traffic in controlled substa nces is essential to the App. 76 effective control of the interstate incidents of such traf- fic. (7) The United States is a party to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, and other inter- national conventions designed to establish effective control over international and domestic traffic in con-trolled substances.
