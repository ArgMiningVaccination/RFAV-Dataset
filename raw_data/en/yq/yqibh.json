Naturopaths view the symptoms of illness as warnings of lifestyle flaws or imbalances in the body. Colour Properties Green Nurtures, calms nerves and reduces tension. Blue Cools the body and has strong yin or vata (wind) properties. Colour Properties Red Boosts digestion and has warming effect. Orange Provides vitality, mental clarity, joy and emotional expansion. Acts as a motor stimulant, Yellow boosts morning energy and facilitates digestion. HIV is a retrovirus, important genes, there are different classes of HIV The thalamus receives information from the afferent systems in the spinal cord, and the information is relayed from their to other parts of the brain. Neural impulses go to the somatosensory cortex in the cerebral cortex, which is on the surface of the brain. The entire surface of the skin is mapped onto the primary somatosensory cortex. Areas, like the hands, and face, occupy more of the somatosensory cortex than the back. Motor reorganization and phantom limb pain - fMRI studies Lotze et al. (1999a, b) employed the fMRI-technique to confirm the relationship of phantom limb pain in the sensorimotor domain. They were interested in correlations between cortical reorganization and painful and non-painful phantom sensations. The deafferentiated hand area was mapped indirectly by somatotopic adjacent lip movements and directly by imagined movements of the absent limb. Executed movements were compared to imagined movements in 14 upper limb amputees (7 with and 7 without phantom limb pain) and in 10 controls. In the control group the intensity of activation in the contralateral primary motor cortex during imagination was about 40% compared to the activation during the execution of hand movements (Lotze et al., 1999a). The lip movement showed symmetrical activation maxima in the primary motor and sensory cortex of both hemispheres. The displacement of the lip into the direction of the deafferentiated area in the precentral (M1) and postcentral (S1) gyrus showed a 0.7 positive correlation to the intensity of phantom limb pain (assessed with the West Haven Multidimensional Pain Inventory). This result demonstrates that cortical reorganization in phantom pain extends to motor areas confirming reports from somatosensory MEG and EEG studies. The amputated patients differed in the use of arm prosthesis: investigating the influence of myoelectric prosthesis use revealed that patients doing this extensively showed no cortical displacement of the lip into the hand area and no phantom limb pain (Lotze et al., 1999b). Left: Patients without phantom limb pain and healthy subjects have a symmetrical representation of the lip during repetitive lip pursing movement. Right: Patients with phantom limb pain showed an asymmetric fMRI-representation of the lip in the primary motor and somatosensory cortex with displacement into the direction of the former hand area contralateral to the amputated hand. When people have chronic pain, a number of other things in their life change as well. These changes tend to increase the person's experience of pain, and their life b begins to revolve around their pain. Migraine headaches - recurrent attacks of pain that vary in intensity frequency and duration, associated with loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and exaggerated sensitivity to light. Often involve sensory, motor, or mood disturbances. Migraine with aura is characterized by identifiable sensory disturbances that precede the headache pain; migraine without aura has a sudden onset and an intense throbbing on one side of the head. Women are more likely to have migraines than men. One study reported that about 18% of women, but only 7% of men in the US had at least one migraine per year. One survey also found that people in the lowest income group had 60% more migraines that people in the two highest income brackets. Tension headaches are muscular in origin and are characterized by sustained contractions of the muscles of the neck, shoulders, scalp, and face. They have a gradual onset, sensations of tightness, or pressure, and a dull steady ache on both sides of the head. Cluster headaches are a type of severe headache that occurs in daily clusters for 4 to 16 weeks. Some symptoms are like migraine, but they are briefer, rarely lasting loner than two hours. The headache is localized on one side of the head, and often the eye on the other side becomes bloodshot and waters. These are much more common in men than women, at about 10:1. These headaches appear in a cluster and disappear, recurring every year or two. Although only half as many people have low back pain, as get headaches, low back pain accounts for nearly twice as many lost workdays. The number of work days lost in the US costs 20 billion per year. Can be caused by infections, degenerative diseases and malignancies, but the most common cause is injury or stress resulting in musculoskeletal and neurological disorders in the lower back. A goodly number of men and women injure their backs at work, or develop back pain from performing repeated job activities. Four main causes of lower back pain are 1. A herniated disk, which is caused by the disc material compressing nerves roots, resulting in pain that radiates from the low back to the leg. Another cause is skeletal joint dysfunction, caused by misalighnments or stresses of the axial joint. A third cause is myofascial tension, or muscle spasm, which produces a continuous dull ache. A fourth cause is environmental reinforcers. Pain behaviors can exempt people from unpleasant tasks and encourage them to complain as a way of manipulating people. Characterized by extremely sensitive trigger points, experienced as a continual dull ache in any part of the body...most common locations are the lower back, shoulders, neck, and head. It has been suggested that muscle tension produces pain, which in turn creates more muscle tension and even more pain. However, it has been difficult to find any evidence for this hypothesis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an auto-immune disorder characterized by swelling and inflammation of the joints, as well as destruction of cartilage, bone, and tendons. Most people have a fluctuating course of remissions and progressions. Osteoarthritis is a progressive inflammation of the joints affecting mostly older people, characterized by a dull ache in the join area, exacerbated by movement Rheumatoid arthritis is an auto-immune disorder characterized by swelling and inflammation of the joints, as well as destruction of cartilage, bone, and tendons. Most people have a fluctuating course of remissions and progressions. Osteoarthritis is a progressive inflammation of the joints affecting mostly older people, characterized by a dull ache in the join area, exacerbated by movement Cancer pain is caused by any malignant neoplasm, or as a consequence of therapeutic intervention for the disease, or both. Pain is present in about 30% to 40% of cancer cases, and 60% to 90% of all terminal cancer cases. Some types of cancer are more likely to pain than others. Cancer patients who suffer pain are more likely to develop depression,anxiety, and hypochondriasis. Phantom limb pain is the experience of chronic pain in an absent body part. Even children born without a limb can experience sensations in the missing part. Some amputees feel cramping, shooting, burning, or crushing pain in their absent limb. Melzack and Wall (1988) reported that 72T of amputees have pain in their phantom limb 8 days after surgery, 65% have pain 6 months afterward, and 60% have pain 2 years later. Some people have suggested that the experience of phantom limb pain is merely an emotional reaction to loss of the limb. Melzack (1992) argued that the phantom limb sensation is the result of the generation of a characteristic pattern of neural activity, which he called a neuromatrix. These patterns of activity are continually letting our brains know that our body is intact, as well as sending messages regarding its position in space. When a limb is removed, the neuromatrix continues to operate. Motor reorganization and phantom limb pain - fMRI studies Lotze et al. (1999a, b) employed the fMRI-technique to confirm the relationship of phantom limb pain in the sensorimotor domain. They were interested in correlations between cortical reorganization and painful and non-painful phantom sensations. The deafferentiated hand area was mapped indirectly by somatotopic adjacent lip movements and directly by imagined movements of the absent limb. Executed movements were compared to imagined movements in 14 upper limb amputees (7 with and 7 without phantom limb pain) and in 10 controls. In the control group the intensity of activation in the contralateral primary motor cortex during imagination was about 40% compared to the activation during the execution of hand movements (Lotze et al., 1999a). The lip movement showed symmetrical activation maxima in the primary motor and sensory cortex of both hemispheres. The displacement of the lip into the direction of the deafferentiated area in the precentral (M1) and postcentral (S1) gyrus showed a 0.7 positive correlation to the intensity of phantom limb pain (assessed with the West Haven Multidimensional Pain Inventory).

Right: Patients with phantom limb pain showed an asymmetric fMRI-representation of the lip in the primary motor and somatosensory cortex with displacement into the direction of the former hand area contralateral to the amputated hand. To show where the pain is experienced, a picture of a human figure, front and back, is given to patients, and they mark on the figure where they are experiencing pain. To describe how their pain feels, they are given a number of adjectives to select from, such as quivering, pulsing, throbbing, pounding, dull sore aching, radiating, piercing, shooting, numb, pricking, boring, hot, burning, 1st line of medications are acetaminophen, and ibuprofen...these reduce inflammation at the site of injury, and stop the synthesis of the neurochemicals that transmit pain impulses. -peripherally acting analgesics Centrally acting analgesics: narcotics - bind to opiate receptors in the central nervous system. Codeine and morphine are made from the opium poppy, or synthetically reproduced, such as Percodan and Demerol. The molecules in these drugs bind to endorphin receptors in the brain and spinal cord, and block the transmission of pain signals. Issues of addition? Opponent processes. Local anesthetics - Novocain and lidocaine - either topically, or injected at the site. Antidepressants, sedatives? Surgical control is considered a last resort, some try to disrupt the transmission of pain from the periphery to the spinal cord, others to stop the flow upward to the pain. Side effect - loss of movement. Pain often returns. Acupuncture - takes fine needles and stimulates the peripheral nerves...analgesia can last for hours. Behavior modification is a process for changing behavior through the application of operant condition principles. The goal of behavior modification is to shape behavior, not to change feelings of stress or sensations of pain. Behavior modification is based on Skinner's idea that positive and negative reinforcers are important for operant conditioning. A positive reinforcer is any stimulus that, when added to a situation, increases the probability that the behavior it follows will recur. Also known as rewards. A negative reinforcer is any negative or painful stimulus that, when removed from a situation, increases the probability that the behavior it follows will recur. Fordyce (1974) emphasized the role of operant conditioning in perpetuating pain behaviors. He thought that the increased attention and sympathy, financial compensation, and relief from work and social obligations, are positive reinforcers for pain behaviors. In a treatment program behavioral modification will begin with staff ignoring pain complaints, and giving positive feedback for activity Complete medical systems - each of these systems has a comprehensive set of principles dictating the diagnosis and treatment of various conditions. Ayurvedic Medicine: Ayurveda, meaning \"the science of life\" originated in India more than 5000 years ago. It is an extensively developed science and the oldest known medical system in the world. Ayurveda describes the world as a system of interacting forces. It aims to balance the forces that influence the mind, body, and spirit, enabling a person a live in harmony and optimum health. Plana is the life force that must exist before anything else. It is similar to the Chinese concept of Qi. Plana is the source of the five elements recognized by Ayurveda: fire, earth, water, air, and ether (space). These elements make up all matter in the universe, and are the building blocks of the human body. These five elements are condensed into three forces, called vata (wind), kapha (Phlegm) and pitta (bile). Together these forces are called the tridosha and the basic aim of Ayurvedic treatments is to maintain the proper balance of the tridosha. During diagnosis, an Ayurvedic physician assesses dietary intake and lifestyle. Pulse reading, tongue diagnosis and an evaluation of a person's skin, nails, and complexion are other diagnostic tools. Ayurveda has a strong preventive aspect and dietary counselling to maintain health is a central component. Massage, meditation, and yoga are also used to maintain the body's health. One the body's consitution is determined, the practitioner will prescribe treatment to assist digestion and the absorption of nutrients as well as to faciliate circulation and elimination. Treatments can include dietary changes, herbal medicines, cleansing therapies, chakra therapy, massage and meditation. Some therapies used in Ayurveda Cleansing therapy - goal is to detoxify the body...might include rubbing with warm oils, special diets, enemas, laxatives or herbs that induce vomiting. These procedures are intense and may be detrimental if performed improperly, so supervision from an experienced practitioner is necessary. Meditation and prayer are also used to aid spiritual well being. Like other forms of mind-body medicine, these tx may be beneficial to physical well-being as well. Mantras and incense are sometimes used. Mantras consist of repeated sounds used to calm the mind and provide a glimpse at bliss. Their vibrational quality is thought to heal when used correctly. Incense is used to calm the mind and promote mental clarity. Ayurveda also uses a variety of herbal therapies. There is no legislated regulation of Ayurveda practitioners in Canada. In India, physicians must take a five year university-level course. Homeopathy Involves specialized remedies to treat the whole person rather than a diagnosed condition. Hundreds of homeopathic remedies are availabe, and are prepared from dilute extracts of animal, plant, and mineral substances. Homeopathy means \"like illness\" and refers to one of the most important principles of homeopathy, which is \"like cures like\". Homeopathy involves treating people with tiny doses of natural substances that in larger quantities would cause symptoms similar to those the person has. This method is called the law of similars. The second major principle of homeopathy is called the Law of Infinitesimals, which states that the more dilute a homeopathic remedy, the stronger it is. Homeopathic remedies are systematically diluted to tiny doses. Homeopathy is popular in Europe, where a number of clinical trials have looked at homeopathic methods. A recent paper in the prestigious British Journal, The Lancet, concluded that the effects of homeopathy could not be attributed to the placebo effect and urged further clinical study. Homeopathic combination remedies are sold in some drug and health food stores. The over the counter remedies contain combinations of different remedies that are most often prescribed for particular illnesses. These remedies carry little risk of side effects because they are so dilute. For treatments specifically targeted to particular symptoms, a consultation with a qualified homeopath is required. The cost of the initial consultation can vary from $80 to $250, depending upon the practitioners years of experience, and can take up to two hours. Follow-up sessions are much less expensive. North American Aboriginal Healing Traditions The aboriginal peoples of North America come from a variety of different cultures, and there is no single healing tradition that can be called aboriginal North American medicine, but many of the different traditions share common ideas and images. They do share a central belief that healing is a holistic process, and that physical healing also requires spiritual, mental, and emotional healing. The four quarters of the medicine wheel, a symbol that some native elders and healers use to speak about healing, can represent the four aspects of life that are important for healing: spiritual, emotioinal, mental, and physical. Another important feature of many aboriginal healing traditions is the healing circle. Healing circles allow participats to speak to the community and find, as well as offer, support. Many aboriginal healing traditions place emphasis on people's connection to the community, and teach that personal or physical healing will only occur when people work to heal their relationships with the world around them. Sweat lodges and other ceremonies involving dancing, singing, and chanting, are also used in the healing traditions of aboriginal cultures. Medicinal herbs are also widely used. Four herbs used frequently at First Nations gatherings are tobacco, cedar, sage, and sweet grass. They are smudged, meaning they are burnt so that they integrate with the surrounding environment, and participants become linked when they breathe in the herb. Sage is burned to cleanse the area before ceremonies begin, sweetgrass clears the mind of negative thoughts, cedar cleanses the body and protects it from illness, and tobacco thanks the Creator for many things, including healing and providing food and medicine. Treatments are a specific response to extensive reviews of an individual's lifestyle and nutritional requirements. Naturopaths are often trained in a number of healing practices derived from a number of systems, including acupuncture, herbal treatments, massage, homeopathy, and nutritional counselling. Some provinces, including BC, have a provincial association that naturopaths must reister with. The only Canadian training program recognized by the Canadian Naturopathic Association is a four-hear program at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine in Toronto. In BC, visits to a naturopath are sometimes covered by the provincial health plan, if the naturopath has opted into the plan. Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture TCM is a complete medical system with its own unique philosophy, diagnositics, and treatment methods. The goal of TCM is to balance the yin (vital function) and the yang (vital essence). The balancing of yin and yang stabilizes a person's energy, otherwise known as Qi. TCM also includes extensive nutritional counselling. A proper diet supports health and vitality. Qigong is a form of exercise that focuses on breathing and meditation and is used to support and boost a person's Qi. Acupuncture, a third component of TCM, is used to treat illness by stimulating the righteous Qi and ensuring tit cirulates freely to nourish all parts of the body. Herbal treatments may also be used to strength the righteous Qi in certain parts of the body. To be qualified as a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, a practitioner must graudate from a Chinese Medicine University or have completed a four-year program specializing in TCM after having completed an undergraduate degree. Acupuncture is a component of TCM. It simulates the flow of Qi in specific organs or areas through the insertion of needles at designated points on the body. These acupuncture points have been identified by acupuncturists in China and elsewhere over thousands of years. Acupuncture can be used to treat generalized symptoms, such as fatigue, and can be useful for localized symptoms, such as pain. Some clinical trials have shown that acupuncture can reduce symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in people with diabetes. Acupuncture has also been used to stimulate the immune system. One study found that acupuncture was related to an increase in CD4 cells in people with cancer. Acupressure also stimulates acupuncture points, but with massage, instead of needles. Although acupuncture is an important component of traditional Chinese medicine, other medical professionals are trained in its use, including naturopaths, chiropractors, and medical doctors. In BC, only those trained and designated as registered acupuncturists may practice. Wellness strategies: Medical systems like homeopathy, naturopathy and TCM offer users s spectrum of treatment options and a philosophical system in which to understand them. Although some people looking for alternative treatments chose to learn about these systems of health, others look to complementary therapies to treat specific health concerns. These therapies sometimes are derived from complete medical systems but are now used as stand-alone therapies. Some are ancient therapies that are still closely tied to traditional systems, e.g. Yoga is an important component of Ayurveda, although many people who use it are not familiar with the broader Ayurvedic medical principles. Aromotherapy Essential oils extracted from planats are used to treat illness and improve overall well-being. Lavender oil can counter stress and fatigue, whereas peppermint oil is thought to improve circulation and relieve tension headaches. Aromotherapy relies on our sense of smell. Most people have experienced memories triggered by particular aromas. It makes sense, then, that aromas can affect mood, stress level and sense of well-being. The emotional impact of different aromas varies from person to person. Many people enjoy and benefit from aromotherapy, but some do not. Colour Therapy Seeing colour affects our senses, state of mind, mood, and emotions. Colour can stimulate and energize or calm and sedate. Colour affects the foods we eat, the clothes we wear, and the environments we frequent. Colours have different wavelenghts and vibrational frequencies. Colour is important in many complementary therapies. Gem stones used to enhance the energy of the chakras in Ayurvedic medicine are chosen by color. Essence therapies rely on the idea that plants, gems, and crystals have a vital energy that can have a healing effect. Most essence therapies focus on a person's emotions and spiritual well-being, rather than on physical healing. Essences are made when flowers or gems are placed in pure water and exposed to sunlight. Because the energy of the flower or gem is seen to be vibrational, it spreads through the water. Flower essences depend upon the flowers colour, where it was grown, and sometimes on the medicinal properties associatied with the plant. The best known system of flower essences in Bach remedies. Created by Doctor Edward Bach in the late 1800's, this system classifies 38 negative states of mind, and offers remedies for each state. One of the best known is Rescue Remedy, which contains star of Behlehem, cherry plum clematis, impatiens, rock rose, and crab apple. It is intended for use in times of crisis and acute stress. Herbal therapies: are medically active substances harvested from plants. They are a part of every medical system. Herbal medicines are often thought of as a balanced and moderate approach to healing. Pharmaceutical drugs derived from plants are made by isolating the chemicals that have a medical effect and concentrating them in the medication. Herbal therapies, on the other hand, contain all the chemical components of a plant, as they occur naturally. When taking herbal treatments, learn enough to ensure that the dose is safe and effective. Learn about possible side effects and watch for signs of drug interactions. You can also consult with qualified herablists. Some are accredited through professional societies for homeopaths and TCMDS. Iridology Studies the eye and the markings of the iris...Every organ is connected to the iris through the nervous system. In the first stages of fetal development, the eye is actually part of the brain. As the embryo forms, the eye slowly separates yet maintains thousands of connections to the nervous system. Other nerves in the body receive impulses from the optic nerve, the optic thalamus and the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Iridologists believe that illnesses can be identified by reading the iris. Iridology is a non-invasive way to study a person's physical and mental health. Juicing: Juicing creates liquid foods, which the body can easily assimilate and absorb. It allows vitaimins and other nutrients in fruit and vegetables to be easily consumed. Juicing is used to flush the kidney, liver and gastrointestinal system of toxins. Different juices may have different effects on the body. Masssage and Manipulation Techniques. Most healing traditions use massage. Swedish massage is the form most commonly availabel in Canada. It aims to stimualte blood cirulation and loosen knotted muscles. It may also help the immune system work better through relaxation. Studies are mixed. One study showed an increase in immune system cells with regular massage, but another showed no difference. Benefits have been most dramatically demonstrated in babies. A study of babies born to HIV positive women found that those given regular massages gained weight faster and scored better on tests of motor control and alertness. Massage therapists need to complete a two to three year course to call themselves registered massage therapists in BC and Ontario. Some are covered under the BC health plan. Shiatsu: - a form of Japanese massage that aims to balance the energies in your body. May have immune benefits similar to those suggested for accupuncture, though this has not been studied. Reflexology: was practised in several ancient medical systems. Aims to influence health of different parts of the body by applying pressure to points on the feet and hands. Each point is associated with a different part of the body. Reflexologists do not diagnose specific illnesses. Reflexology is used to reduce stress and tension, improve circulation and eliminate toxins. Chiropractic and Osteopathic Manipulation Chiropractors focus on the skeleton, particularly on the spine and the nerves that run through it. They do not use drugs or surgery, but by manipulating the spine, they can relieve stress as well as musculoskeletal disorders like headache and back pain. Chiropractors also use ultrasound and the application of heat nad light. They often use X-rays to aid in diagnosis. Osteopathic doctors use manual manipulation techniques similar to chiropractors but focus more on the body's soft tissues, the muscles and the ligaments. They may be helpful in treating headaches, joint and muscle pain or fatigue. Osteopathic doctors combine osteopathic techniques with conventional medicine and are licensed as physicians in the United States and Britain. In Canada, the practice of Osteopathic practioners is much more restricted. Alberta and British Columbia allow Doctors of Osteopathy to be licenced as physicians but this is not the case in other provinces. Due to these restrictions, osteopathic practioners are relatively rare in Canada. The Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College is the only accredited school to train chiropractors in Canada. To be admitted to the four-year Doctor of Chiropractic program, students must have completed at least 15 full-credit university courses. A five-year course at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res qualifies graduates to practise in Quebec. Students must have a diploma of collegial studies to be admitted. To be licensed, chiropractors must pass a national board exam and an examination in the province where they want to practise. Mind-Body Therapies: Affirmations Affirmations are positive statements about health and identity. They are always spoken in the first person and in the present tense. &quot;I am strong and healthy,&quot; is an example. Some people may read them aloud or memorize them for repeated use. Others prefer to listen to them as they are read aloud by a friend or played on a recording device: they find that this method makes it easier for them to concentrate on the words. Hundreds of books and tapes offer affirmations to enhance health and self-esteem. Guided imagery aims to mobilize the imagination to promote physical and holistic healing. Guided imagery is used to direct thoughts to an environment where you have total control within your own mind. It is used to relieve the anxiety that accompanies illness and the pain that may be a symptom of illness. Several studies suggest that guided imagery effectively controls anxiety and pain. With some guided imagery, you imagine yourself in a relaxing time or place (your grandmother's kitchen or a sandy beach). Studies of the effect of guided imagery on the immune system have produced mixed results, since the effectiveness of guided imagery may be influenced by such things as receptiveness to hypnosis and the ability to accurately imagine what is happening in the body. Meditation: The art of meditation involves becoming aware of your thoughts, observing them and eventually achieving mastery over them. Meditation means listening to your body and the workings of your own mind and spirit. Many forms of meditation teach awareness of the subconscious act of breathing. When you are in sync with your breathing, you enter a different realm of consciousness. Doing so may help you relax and make you feel more rested than after the deepest sleep. It may also give you a sense of calm, peace, joy and efficiency. Some people use meditation to get a clearer view of reality. With practice and discipline, meditation is used to cultivate mindfulness. Meditation can be associated with specific spiritual beliefs and is a part of many culture-based approaches to healing, including Ayurveda, First Nations healing traditions and traditional Chinese medicine. Some forms of meditation require that you maintain specific postures or repeat specific sounds or phrases. Other forms are much more casual. Many people meditate when they paint, write or watch a sunset. People use meditation to help themselves relax and deal with stress and anxiety. Meditation also increases peoples feelings of control over their lives. Meditation is also used to strengthen sense of self since it may be understood as a way of listening to your internal voice. At least one study links participation in prayer or meditation to better overall health for people with aids. Many different spiritual traditions teach meditation. What is important is finding a method that is meaningful to you. Stress management programs identify the ways you currently cope with stress and teach new mental and emotional techniques for dealing with these issues. Stress management often involves a physical component, such as a breathing exercise, meditation or physical exercise. It may also incorporate counselling sessions or massage work or both. Most people who participate in such programs feel the sessions improve their day-to-day life experiences. A number of small studies confirm that stress management programs lead to relief from anxiety and improvements in quality of life. Since it has been shown that stress has a negative effect on the immune system, many people believe that their immune systems have benefited from stress management programs. But study results have been mixed, partly because the definition of a stress management program varies widely. One study demonstrated an improvement in herpes outbreaks in HIV-positive men after a stress management program. Another showed increases in the number of CD4+ cells. Tai Chi is related to qigong) and the Chinese martial arts tradition. Like qigong, Tai Chi combines physical movement and meditation. The movements emphasize being aware of your own chi, or qi, and the chi of others. Tai Chi's slow, rhythmic movements have made it a popular form of exercise in Canada, but the mental and physical discipline that it teaches also helps those who practise it to deal with stress. Tai Chi is related to the spiritual teaching of Taoism. There are a number of different forms of Tai Chi, and several are practised in Canada. Yoga is union with the self or divine truth. Although many people think of it primarily as an exercise program, the stated purpose of yoga is liberation: to help an individual achieve longevity, rejuvenation and self-realization. It may also be used to heal and prevent illness. There is more to yoga than stretches and postures, but these components are usually the first ones that people learn. Yoga contains eight components, which can be incorporated as a person progresses. These eight stages combine mental, emotional and physical aspects. They are yama (abstentions), niyana (observances), asana (postures), paranayama (life (sense withdrawal), dharana (concentration), dhyana (meditation) and samadhi (contemplation and state of perfect equilibrium). Yoga is used to establish a sense of relaxation and awareness. It may also increase oxygen consumption and reduce stress. Doing yoga on a regular basis builds muscle strength and flexibility. It is used to treat insomnia too. Touch therapies are based on the belief that people have their own vital energy. This energy field flows through and surrounds the body. Blockages or imbalances in the body cause ill health. This notion is similar to the Chinese concept of qi. Touch therapists modify imbalances in the energy field by using their energy to redirect the energy of others. Therapeutic touch is based on the idea that &quot;the human body, mind, emotions and intuition form a complex, dynamic energy field.&quot; This energy field encompasses the body. When a person is ill, the energy field is out of balance. Therapeutic touch practitioners modify imbalances using their hands but they don't actually touch you. Rather, they believe the energy field extends beyond the body. Although therapeutic touch was derived from the spiritual healing practices of several cultures, practitioners do not require you to hold any particular religious faith. Therapeutic touch is often used by chronic-care nurses to relieve pain and promote relaxation. A small study on the use of therapeutic touch with HIV-positive children found that it effectively reduced anxiety. Reiki means universal life energy. Ki is the Japanese form of qi, the Chinese word meaning vital energy. Reiki is similar to therapeutic touch but was developed in Asia. Like therapeutic touch, reiki is based on the belief that living things share life energy. When that life energy is blocked, it creates an imbalance that may appear as illness. Unblocking the energy helps get a person back into balance. During a reiki massage, the practitioner's hands are placed on the body to channel this energy. The client remains fully clothed. Reiki massages generally take 60 to 90 minutes and cost $40 to $60. Reiki practitioners are trained by reiki masters, who are more experienced practitioners. Reiki practitioners are not regulated in Canada and there are no provincial or national associations for Canadian practitioners. "}
