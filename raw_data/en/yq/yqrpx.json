Program Funding Opportunity Description 1. Purpose This notice solicits applications for the Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Other Related Disabilities (LEND) training program , and the option of a single, 1- year LEND supplement when funds are available, to expand or develop programs able to diagnose or rule out individuals with autis m spectrum disorder (ASD) or other developmental disabilities (DD) across their lifespan. The purpose of the LEND program is to improve the health of individuals who have, or are at risk for developing, ASD/DD by providing graduate-level training in mater nal and child health interdisciplinary leadership education in neurodevelopmental and related disabilities programs . LEND trainees should: (i) receive an appropriate balance of academic, clinical, and community opportunities; (ii) be culturally competent; (iii) be ethnically diverse; (iv) demonstrate a capacity to evaluate, diagnose or rule out, develop, and provide evidence-based interventions to individuals with ASD/DD across their lifespan; and (v) demonstrate an ability to use a family -centered approach. LEND provides interdisciplinary opportunities for trainees to access content and experiences beyond the scope of their respective academic disciplines. The goal of the program is to increase the capacity of the workforce trained to meet the complex needs of individuals with A SD/DD by enhancing the expertise and leadership skills of practicing professionals, families, and self -advocates dedicated to working with and improving the system of care for individuals with ASD/DD. LEND programs meet these goals through a range of acti vities. Specific objectives are to: 1) Train graduate and post -graduate students, family members, people with disabilities, and community professionals. 2) Deliver training that includes a balance of academic, clinical, leadership, and community -based learning opportunities framed in an interdisciplinary, and person-/ family -centered manner. 3) Engage trainees at varying levels of intensity through long-, medium -, and short - term training opportunities. 4) Engage diverse cohorts of trainees and faculty, including those from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, geographic regions, and other factors reflecting the broader population. 5) Increase the number of interdisciplinary diagnostic evaluations provided by LEND faculty and trainees. 6) Provide continuing educati on opportunities for practicing professionals. HRSA -21-041 2 7) Provide technical assistance to local, state, and national programs and agencies to improve the system of care for people with disabilities. The purpose of the optional LEND Supplement is to enhance LEND training program capacity to respond to emerging needs and support innovative training practices . 2. Background This program is authorized by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 280i -1 (Title III, \u00a7 399BB of the Public Health Service Act , as amended by the Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education, and Support ( CARES ) Act of 2019 (Pub. L. 116-60)). In carrying out these provisions, HRSA supports training programs, research, and state systems grants to: Improve access to early screening, diagnosis and intervention for children with ASD or other DDs; Increase the number of professionals able to diagnose ASD and other DDs; Promote the use of evidence-based interventions for individuals at higher risk for ASD and other DDs as early as possible; Increase the number of professionals able to provide evidence-based interventions for individuals diagnosed with ASD or other DDs; Provide information and education on ASD and other DDs to increase public awareness; Promote research and information distribution on the development and validation of reliable screening tools and interventions for ASD and other DDs; and Promote early screening of individuals at higher risk for ASD and other DDs. The Autism CARES Act of 2019 emphasizes improving health outcomes and the well - being of individuals with ASD/DD across the lifespan. A comprehensive picture of ASD among children in the United States is best understood by examining two key estimates of ASD prevalence.1 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 1 in 54 children have ASD based on an in-depth examination of 11 local areas ,2 while parent -reported data from the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health documented that 1 in 40 children aged 3- 17 years have a diagnosis of ASD.3 Furthermore, even though children can be diagnosed as early as age 2, on average, children identified with ASD were not diagnosed until after age 4.4 Although 2016 Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network (ADDM ) data suggest no overall difference in ASD prevalenc e between 8-year -old B lack and White children, there were disparities for Black children in early evaluation and diagnosis of ASD. Hispanic children were identified as having ASD less frequently than White or Black children.5 1 Kogan, et al. (2018) The Prevalence of Parent -Reported Autis m Spectrum Dis order Among US Children. Pediatrics 142(6). 2 Autis m and Developmental Dis abilities Monitoring Network (2016 data) ( http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html ) 3 Kogan, et al.

MMWR Surveillance Sum m ary , 69(4). HRSA -21-041 3 The LEND Program focuses on t he need for more providers to care for children with, or at risk for , ASD/DD. It is well established that a lack of trained providers limits access to care for children/youth with complex disabilities like ASD and their families. Access to adequate health care is a significant problem for children with special health care needs, and is even more pronounced for those with ASD. Many needs remain unmet for these children and families, particularly pertaining to adequate service provision for their complex needs.6 Since racial and ethnic disparities exist in the early evaluation and diagnosis of ASD, it can be inferred that additional professional training is needed in the field to mitigate these differences, particularly in underserved populations. The impact of these disparities on health outcomes may be compounded by other social determinants of health (SDOH) across the lifespan. SDOH are conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. SDOH include factors like socioeconomic status, education, neighborhood and physical environment, community violence, employment, and social support networks, as well as access to health care. Addressing SDOH , which affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality -of-life outcomes and risks, is in line wi th HRSA 's objective to improve the health and well -being of individuals and the communities in which they reside. Both the public health and health care systems lack sufficient numbers of providers trained in systems of care and exposed to interprofessional education and interdisciplinary practices to meet the needs of children with ASD who often have multiple co-occurring conditions. Adults with ASD are also vulnerable to health care disparities because services and medical treatments for individuals wit h ASD are largely child-focused. As such, a significant barrier to care for adults with ASD is a lack of training for medical providers in treating adults with ASD . 7 LEND programs can reduce these health disparities by supporting providers from diverse dis ciplines that may provide care to individuals w ith ASD/DD across the lifespan. Since its inception in 1967, the LEND program has trained tens of thousands of health professionals from a wide variety of disciplines to provide the best possible services and supports for children with developmental disabilities and their families. The Division of MCH Workforce Development at the Maternal and Child Health Bureau at HRSA supports the training of a pipeline of well -trained health professionals and leaders equipped to address the special health needs of MCH populations. 8 LEND programs train providers to screen for ASD/DD using the most widely accepted tools in the field. Developmental screening is a priority at the national and state levels and has increased over time. According to 2016 data from the National Survey of Children's Health, the proportion of children who received a developmental screening varied substantially by income, and uninsured children were less likely than those with either public or private insurance to receive a screening.9 LEND programs collaborate with early screening and early intervention programs in the state to reach as many 6 Cheak -Zamora and Farmer (2015) The Impact of the Medical Home on Acces s to Care for Children with Autis m Spectrum Dis orders .

Developmental screening is also one of the 15 National Performance Measures for State Titl e V programs, which may increase the focus on screening at the state level. In fiscal year (FY) 2018 , the 52 LEND program s collectively trained 1, 495 long-term trainees (300+ hours of t raining); 5,436 medium -term trainees (40- 299 hours of training); and 13,323 short -term trainees (less than 40 hours of training). Eighty -two percent of the 658 LEND program graduates who completed a survey 5 years following program completion indicated that they are engaged in work related to MCH populations. Further, 90 percent of respondents indicated that they participate in leadership activities in academic, clinical, public health practice, and/or public policy and advocacy activities after completing the training program . In FY 2018, LEND training programs reported collaborating with State Title V (MCH) agencies or other MCH - related programs to provide 3, 113 technical assistance activities to almost 101,856 recipients.10 The LEND programs have made a unique contribution to the field by providing comprehensive, interdisciplinary leadership training to providers and students who screen, diagnose, and treat those with ASD/DD. In FY 2016- 2018, the LEND programs provided interdisciplinary diagnostic services to 316,518 children to confirm or rule out ASD/DD. 11 LEND programs train a wide range of disciplines including, but not limited to, psychology, speech-language pathology, audiology, physical therapy, as well as family members and individuals with disabilit ies. In FY 2018, 93 percent of former long-term trainees were working in an interdisciplinary manner 5 years after training (n=718) and 97 percent 10 years after training (n=330) . 10 LEND programs also promote innovative practice models that enhance cultural/linguistic responsiveness , partnerships among disciplines, and person-/family -centered approaches to care. This training opportunity empowers both clinical providers and non-clinic ians to further develop and impact the state and national systems of car e, and to become leaders in the field. LEND programs have a long history of including family faculty and trainees in order to enhance family participation at all levels of program design, implementation, and evaluation. The intent is to fully integrate within maternal and child health leadership training programs the family voice, promote family centeredness, and offer development opportunities to family leaders in the field.12 LEND programs have increasingly included self -advocates as tr ainees , providing these trainees the opportunity to build on their own lived experiences to develop advocacy, leadership, and other relevant skills .13 One study found that other trainees in the program state that the inclusion of self -advocate trainees strengthened their own l eadership skills.14 10 Dis cretionary Grant Information System (DGIS).

HRSA -21-041 5 MCHB places emphasis on improving service delivery to women, children, adolescents, and families from communities with limited access to comprehensive care including those from underserved populations and rural areas. This same emphasis applies to improving service delivery to children with special health care needs, including those with ASD /DD. LEND recipients are strongly encouraged to work collaboratively with State Title V agencies and other MCH training programs to maximize access t o MCH services, with emphasis on ASD/DD. II.

In your application: State the overall goal(s) and objectives of the project . The objectives should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and t ime-based (SMART) for each project year. 1) LEND Trainees Long-term trainees Long-term trainees (LTT) complete 300+ hours of LEND didactic and experiential training. LEND training is in addition to a trainee's graduate or post -graduate discipline -related training, including clinical and leadership requirements. LEND training provides additional disability perspectives to each trainee beyond what they would receive in their discipline's training program. LEND trainees demonstrate interest in a career serving individuals with disabilities. This should include a commitment to leadership and improving the system of care for people with ASD/DD by acquiring knowledge and skills to evaluate and diagnose or rule out ASD/DD; interest in developing and providing evidence-based interventions; and a commitment to providing interdisciplinary, person-/family - centered, and culturally responsive care. Recruitment and retention of qualified trainees representing diverse backgrounds is a priority for DMCHWD. Training programs develop innovat ive means of creating a pathway for future students from diverse groups at the high school, community college, and undergraduate levels. LEND Performance Measure, Training 06 requires annual reporting on the number and percentage of LTTs from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (see Reporting ). Program Expectations LEND program s should bring together faculty and LTTs from multiple disciplines for the interdisciplinary process to be effectively demonstrated, developed, and practiced. Programs should provide ample opportunities for trainees to collaborate HRSA -21-041 11 with one another in an interdisciplinary manner, even when training is delivered remotely. Trainee cohorts should include diverse disciplines with a similar make-up of t he disciplines represented by the core faculty ( see Faculty Disciplines ). The programs should strive to have a balance of trainees representing clinical and non-clinical disciplines. No single trainee discipline should make up more than 25 percent of a LEND cohort. Each cohort should have the minimum number of trainee and faculty disciplines represented as described in Table 2: Allowable Funding Levels . Annually, each LTT cohort should include at least one family member trainee. See description in Table 1: Long-Term Trainee Criteria . By year 3 of the project, each LTT cohort must also include a person with a disabilit y as a self -advocate trainee. Self -advocates participating in LEND will build upon the skills and knowledge acquired through their lived experience with disability to develop and enhance their leaders hip expertise and share a disability perspective with other trainees . Table 1 depicts the educational level general ly supportable for trainees/fellows by discipline as well as a description and recruitment criteria for other LTTs . Table 1: Long-term Trainee Criteria Trainee Disciplines Qualifications by discipline Applied behavioral analysis Audiology Disability stu dies Human genetics/genetic counseling Health administration Nursing Nutrition Occupational therapy Physical therapy Psychology Public health Social work Special education/education Speech-language pathology School psychology/school counseling Trainees fr om these professional disciplines are master's or doctoral candidates, or post -master's and post - doctoral fellows. Trainees may also be practicing professionals from the community with graduate degrees or commensurate work or leadership experience. While the emphasis of the program is generally providers serving children and adolescents , programs may recruit LTTs who intend to provide services to adults with ASD/DD when they enter the workforce. Medicine, pediatric providers Medical students and those preparing for relevant pediatric medical specialties and subspecialties, including developmental - behavioral pediatrics, neurodevelopmental disabilities, medicine-pediatrics, child and adolescent psychiatry, pediatric neurology, and/or HRSA -21-041 12 Trainee Disciplines Qualifications by discipline medical genetics. Pra cticing providers also may participate as trainees. Medicine, adult providers Medical students and those preparing for relevant medical specialties and subspecialties that will serve transition- aged youth and/or adults with ASD/DD throughout the lifespan. Practicing providers also may participate as trainees . Pediatric or adult dentistry Dental students and those preparing for dental specialties and subspecialties with interest in caring for individuals with ASD/DD. Family members Required, a minimum of one family LTT each year. Parents and siblings of those with neurodevelopmental disabilities, including ASD, with demonstrated interest in developing leadership skills and sharing family perspectives with the trainee cohort. No educational minimum is required for participation as a LEND trainee, nor is current enrollment in an academic program. Self-advocates/individuals with disabilities (including those with intellectual disabilities) Required, a minimum of one self - advocate LTT each year, beginning at least in year 3. Demonstrated readiness to develop leadership skills and shar e disability perspectives with the trainee cohort. No educational minimum is required for participation as a LEND trainee, nor is current enrollment in an academic program. Other trainee disciplines may be considered with consultation with the assigned MCHB project officer (PO), after award . To obtain approval, the program must demonstrate that the trainee intends to work with disability populations in the future, and that t he program has an appropriate faculty mentor and learning opportunities for the trainee. While MCHB recognizes that specialties/subspecialties of medicine are distinct, any specialties that are listed under \"medicine, pediatric providers\" will count as a single discipline towards meeting the interdisciplinary requirements listed in Table 2: Allowable Funding Levels . The same applies to \"medicine, adult providers.\" This will ensure that training cohorts include a wide array of cl inical and non-clinical trainees. Current undergraduate students cannot be considered long-term LEND trainees unless they are filling a family or self -advocate discipline position, and the exception has been approved by the MCHB project officer . HRSA -21-041 13 Trainee support varies by discipline in accordance with standards of the profession, availability of other support, nature of training required to meet program goals, and other factors. Appendix A: Applicable Standards for Using Grant Funds to Support LEND Trainees/Fellows defines trainees and fellows and provides guidelines for trainee/fellow support. LEND LTTs generally are expected to complete their training within a 12-month period. However, t rainees may complete a second year of long-term LEND training if the following criteria apply : 1. If a trainee is unable to complete the long-term LEND training (300+ hours) in a 12-month period, it is allowable to spread out the requirements over 2 years. In these circumstances, a clear -cut co mpletion plan from the training program is required, while also meeting the flexibilities needed by these trainees to complete the program. The curriculum and level of engagement should be determined when the trainee is recruited and commits to the program . o In general, this exception to use a second year applies to family member and self -advocate trainees. However, if trainees in other disciplines need similar accommodations, approval from the MCHB PO is required, after award. o In such scenarios, the trainee may only count once toward the minimum number of LTTs required in Table 2: Allowable Funding Levels . o Family and self -advocate trainees completing long-term LEND training over 2 years may only count toward the family and self - advocate trainee requirement for 1 year. o In this scenario, the trainee may receive a total of one LEND stipend over the 2-year LEND training experience from these grant funds . The stipend can be prorated and disbursed at the discretion of the program leader ship, and in accordance with institution policies. For maximum stipends, see Appendix A: Applicable Standards for Using Grant Funds to Support LEND Trainees/Fellows . o In performance reports , these trainees may be counted as MTT s in 1 year and LTTs in the other, at the discretion of the recipient , to ensure they receive follow -up surveys after completion of the LEND program. 2. At the program's discretion, certain t rainees may opt to complete an additional year of 300+ hour LEND t raining to enhance their leadership, clinical, teaching, or other skills. They must complete a different LEND curriculum (including new clinical and community placements or leadership and teaching opportunities), than what was completed during their first year as a LTT. HRSA -21-041 14 o In this additional year, these trainees may be counted as LTTs, but cannot be used to meet the minimum LTT numbers for recipient's awarded funding level stated in Table 2: Allowable Funding Levels . o In performance reports , these LTTs are counted as LTTs each year but should only receive follow -up surveys in years 2, 5, and 10 after completion of the LEND program. Former LTTs must be tracked and surveyed for 10 years post -graduation to track the leadership trajectories of trainees and to quantify the impact of LEND programs . This data will be reported on LEND Performance Measures , Training 10, 11, and 12, see Reporting . Innovative ways to maintain contact with former trainees are encouraged in order to ensure long-term tracking and reduce loss to follow -up. Medium - and short -term trainees Medium - and short -term trainees are defined as those engaged in didactic or practical experiences through LEND, as part of a formal course of study. This could include a residency program, rotation, internship, practicum, fellowship, or an advancement in academic credentials through a course of study. These trainees generally do not include practicing professionals engaging in continuing education. Medium -term trainees fall into two tiers: those who complete 40- 149 hours, and those who complete 150- 299 hours of training (known as advanced medium - term). Stipends for advanced medium -term trainees are at the discretion of the recipient . Short -term trainees complete 1- 39 hours of training per year. Program Expectations LEND programs are required to implement medium - and/or short -term training to expand the future workforce of clinicians and/or community providers prepared to serve individuals with ASD/DD. LEND programs can choose to train both medium - term and short -term trainees, or one or the other. Only long-term and advanced medium -term trainees may receive stipends from the grant funds. For LEND Trainees section, i n your application: Include criteri a for and a description of methods of long-term trainee recruitment and selection. Include a description of which disciplines will be included and how they will contribute to your interdisciplinary trainee cohort. Describe the program's strategies for rec ruiting and retaining trainees from diverse backgrounds and for evaluating the success of the efforts. Describe plans to include trainees/faculty in other states or territories to increase the regional or national reach of LEND training network , if applicable. Demonstrate a strategy for including and supporting self -advocate trainees in each LTT cohort starting in or before year 3. HRSA -21-041 15 Include a plan for tracking and reporting on the longitudinal follow -up data about graduates' employment, research, leadership, advocacy efforts, programs initiated, publications submitted, etc. Describe how medium - and/or short -term trainees will be recruited and engaged in the program and in the didactic, clinical, and field experiences available to LTTs. Describe the training opportunities, experiential and didactics, of any planned cohort s of medium - and/or short -term trainees, if applicable. Describe how MTT and STT opportunities are structured, if your program offers individualized experiences using the LTT program as a menu of options . 2) Curriculum and Training Content A strong LEND curriculum for LTTs will incorporate interdisciplinary clinical, leadership, and didactic content to meet the broad range of trainee needs , and prepare trainees to address the full range of neurodevelopmental disabilities, with a focus on ASD/DD . Additionally, the training will prepare trainees for future leadership roles. Program Expectations Provide a comprehensive syllabus, including descriptions of courses, workshops, seminars, and field experiences, that will h elp guide the training program. The syllabus should describe each of the following elements to indicate a comprehensive long-term training program will be offered. Interdisciplinary Clinical and Practicum Experience for Trainees Trainees should experience a variety of clinical settings with appropriate faculty mentorship. Training may occur within clinical settings under the direction of the funded program as well as in community -based settings. The available training opportuniti es and settings should reflect the cultural, social , and ethnic diversity of the community. Opportunities for non-clinical trainees to observe and engage in clinics should be provided to these trainees as they may work with clinicians in the future and c an help clinicians view the clinical setting from a new perspective. Family and self - advocate trainees should participate in clinical settings , when possible. This will provide models to families and patients on ways to engage in peer advocacy, providing f eedback to clinicians from a perspective of lived experience, and helping families navigate the clinical process. Training should be based on a comprehensive, interdisciplinary clinical services model w hich is person-/family -centered and culturally and l inguistically responsive. As appropriate to their discipline, the curriculum should prepare trainees to evaluate, diagnose or rule out, develop, and provide evidence-based interventions to individuals with ASD/DD. HRSA -21-041 16 Field placements in educational settings , state/local agencies, and other settings may be appropriate in addition to or in lieu of clinical placement. Such practicum sites must provide comprehensive, community -based services in a variety of institutional and rural/urban community -based settings and serve individuals with ASD/DD and other special health care needs. Practicum sites in underserved communities are especially impactful for trainees . You are encouraged to coordinate training opportunities with MCHB -funded recipients , Autism CARES recipients , and State Title V programs. Field experiences in interdisciplinary settings are also encouraged. Leadership Skills LEND curriculum must include content and experiences to promote the development of effective leadership skills and prepare trainees to move beyond excellent clinical practice or health administration to leadership through practice, research, teaching, administration, and legislative systems change. The leadership curriculum must prepare trainees to engage effectively in interdiscipli nary practice.15 Strong LEND curricula will be informed by the MCH Leadership Competencies . The leadership curriculum should instruct trainees on effective communication and teaching skills, as well as presentation skills appropriate for a variety of professional and community audiences. Training should provide opportunities to practice, demonstrate, and document effective teaching and communication to and with diverse constituencies (professi onals, self -advocates, families, children and youth with ASD/DD public health leaders, etc.). These experiences should incorporate multiple forms of communication (verbal and written) in diverse venues and methods of delivery. Conflict resolution skills al so should be addressed, if possible. Didactic Training Content Neurodevelopmental and related disabilities, with a focus on ASD/DD. LEND programs should provide didactic training on effective tools for screening and diagnosing ASD/DD; the social environment \u2014the family, community, school, work opportunities; and other issues relevant to health care and other transitions for young adults with ASD/DD. LEND curricula should incorporate instruction on conceptual models of disability (e.g., social , cultural , neurodiversity, and medical models ) and examine the intersection of disability with other life experiences. Examples of various models of disability can be found at: Including People with Disabilities Public Health Workforce Competencies . 15 Interdis ciplinary practice is a team approach among profes s ionals of varying dis ciplines , family members , individuals with dis abilities , and community partners , to improve the delivery of health s ervices , provide training, develop policy, and condu ct res earch. This approach fos ters a s upportive environment that values and relies on the s k ills and expertis e of each team member to arrive at outcome- driven joint decis ions ; mutual res pect among dis ciplines ; and s hared leaders hip, incorporating accountability and res pons ibility for outcomes . HRSA -21-041 17 Public health perspectives and systems of care for individuals with ASD/DD and their families LEND training curricula should address a broad public health perspective and include training about community -based programs and public health services. Topics and activities can include: community needs assessment, public policy formulation and implementation, legislation/policy making, financing, budgeting, program administration, c onsultation, and program planning and evaluation. The curriculum should emphasize development throughout the life course and within a socio -ecological framework to reflect the cumulative impact of famil y, community, and societal factors on development. The curriculum should prepare trainees to assume leadership roles in the development, improvement , and integration of systems of care, especially in programs providing MCH services, for children and youth with special health care needs, particularly those w ith ASD/DD. The curriculum should prepare trainees to understand how systems interact with and influence each other to either decrease or increase risk factors or protective factors that affect a range of health and social outcomes for children with ASD/DD . Attention to the needs of individuals living in rural and other underserved communities is strongly recommended. Curricula should emphasize appropriate didactic and experiential content relative to MCH/Title V and related legislation. The curriculum should also emphasize the development, implementation, and evaluation of systems of care. Cultural and linguistic responsiveness LEND t raining should focus on advancing cultural responsiveness16 among the trainees. Training should include strategies for approaching the differing social, cultural , and health practices of various groups and the implications of these relative to health status and the provision of health care. Training should be responsive to the diversity of the community and specifically serv e low -income communities, racial/ethnic minorities, individuals with limited English proficiency, individuals who have limited access to services, and/or other underserved populations. Including culturally, racially, and ethnically diverse faculty and trainees in all aspects of developing and delivering the curriculum is a key component of promoting cultural competence. Instruction on the intersection of disability with other life experiences, such as race/ethnicity, should be addressed 16 A culturally and linguistically responsive program is characterized by, wr itten strategies and policies for advancing cultural responsiveness and linguistic diversity; provision of knowledge and skill building for trainees, faculty, and staff; data on populations served according to cultural and historically underserved status \u2014racial, ethnic, linguistic, disability, etc.; faculty and instructors representing diverse backgrounds; and periodic assessment of trainee, faculty, and staff progress in developing cultural and linguistic responsiveness. Resources on cultural competence include: The National Center for Cultural Competence , Documenting the Implementation of Cultural and Linguistic Competence, The Curricula Enhancement Module Series created by the National Center for Cultural Competence, Diversity and Inclusion Toolkit , and National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS). HRSA -21-041 18 to increase cultural responsiveness for professionals serving people with disabilities. LEND Performance Measure, Training 02 measures the extent to which cultural and linguistic competence is integrated into the program's policies, guidelines, and training (see Reporting ). In addition to teaching concepts of cultural and linguistic competence, the training programs should be responsive to the cultural and linguistic needs of special populations, services must be accessible to consumers, and the program should strive for representation of historically underrepresented groups. Health equity and diversity The curriculum should emphasize social determinants of health which impact the health status of children, including, but not limited to: socioec onomic status, education, neighborhood and physical environment, community violence, employment, and social support networks, as well as access to health care. The curriculum should explicitly address approaches to increasing health equity and reducing dis parities in access to quality health care, early diagnosis, and early intervention. LEND training should include content and experiences to prepare trainees to provide leadership in cultivating and promoting a diverse MCH workforce. Quality improvement and evidence-based practice The curriculum should emphasize content on science-based judgment, evidence-based practice, and documentation of outcomes and performance measurement. The c urriculum should teach trainees how to use data to inform continuous qual ity improvement efforts in clinical and community -based practice. Person-/family -centered care The curriculum should include content about how to engage in person-/family - centered care and implement medical home concepts. 17 Curriculum on family - centered medical home should address care transitions and connection to community services, and ensure coordination among a wide range of disciplines. Current and emerging focus areas LEND programs are expected to monitor trends, identify emerging needs in the populations they serve, and adapt their curriculum to be responsive to areas of need and/or special interest in the field of ASD/DD. Current topics of interest may include, but are not limited to, neonatal abstinence syndrome, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, COVID -19, maternal mortality, mental health, opioid and substance use disorder, and childhood obesity. 17 Family -centered care is the standard of practice that results in high- quality services as it recognizes the importance of cultural diversity and family traditions; embraces community -based services; and promotes an individual and developmental approach to working with children and families. Person- /family -centered services engage and support youth as they transition to adulthood. In a person- /family -centered setting, all policies, practices , and systems should have the family in mind. HRSA -21-041 19 Transition to adulthood and lifespan issues LEND p rograms should emphasize the challenges that adolescents with ASD/DD face when transitioning to adult health care, and with other life transitions. The curriculum should incorporate transition topics and experiences for trainees. Programs should be prepared to include information on this topic in their annual LEND progress reports, as requested. The curriculum should address the need for research, education, services, and supports for the ASD/DD population in adulthood and emphasize a lifespan developmental approach. The lifespan developmental approach provides an overarching framework for understandi ng human development from conception to death. 18 Research The curriculum should include content to increase critical thinking and academic research skills among trainees. Each doctoral or post -doctoral student is expected to engage in one or more active research projects during his/her tenure, and seek to disseminate findings at scientific symposia and through published articles in peer-reviewed journals. Master's level students are expected to gain knowledge and skills in research methodology and dissemi nation of research findings into practice. For some trainees , the focus will be on reviewing and discerning the quality of research and its applicability to practice. Effective Use of Technology and Telehealth LEND programs should describe efforts to educate trainees about innovative and alternative methods of health care provision, such as telehealth, as well as virtual instruction or distance-learning modalities.19 In your application: Describe how the curriculum for LTTs will incorporate interdiscipli nary clinical, leadership, and didactic content to meet the broad range of trainee needs. Demonstrate how the training will prepare trainees to address ASD/DD. Include a brief syllabus, including descriptions of courses, workshops, seminars, and field experiences in Attachment 5 and cross -reference it in the Curriculum and Training section of your application. Identify the competencies expected of trainees upon completion of the LEND training. 18 American Ps ychologi cal As as the us e of electronic information and telecommunication technologies to s upport long- distance clinical health care, patient and profes s ional health -related education, public health, and health adminis tration. Telehealth is es pecially critical in rural and other remote areas that lack s ufficient health care s ervices , including s pecialty care. The range and us e of telehealth s ervices have expanded over the pas t decades , along with the role of technology in improving and coordinating care. Telehealth modalities can include direct clinical s ervices , HRSA your application, the Interdisciplinary Clinical and Pract icum Experiences for Trainees section should: Describe the patient population (including diagnostic categories served) .

Describe the opportunities trainees will have to practice, demonstrate, and document effective teaching and communication to and with diverse constituencies (professionals, self -advocates, families, children and youth with ASD/DD, public health leaders, etc.). In the application, the Didactic Training Content section should: Describe how the program will present content on neurodevelopm ental and related disabilities ( with a focus on ASD/DD ), including various models of disability. Describe how the curriculum will reflect a broad public health perspective and include training and experiential component s focused on community -based programs and public health services available to MCH populations. Describe how the curriculum will be responsive to the cultural and linguistic needs of special populations, and advance cultural and linguistic competence and r esponsiveness among the trainees. Demonstrate how the curriculum will emphasize development throughout the life course and reflect the cumulative impact of family, community, and societal factors on development. Demonstrate how the LEND program will make services accessible to consumers and include representation from the population to be served and/or other historicall y underrepresented groups . Describe how the curriculum will increase health equity , address social determinants of health, and present approaches to reducing disparities in access to quality health care, early diagnosis, and early intervention. HRSA -21-041 21 Demonstrate how the curriculum will cover content on science-based judgment and evidence-based practice. Identify the procedures the program will use to document outcomes, monitor progress, and use data to drive ongoing quality improvement efforts. Demonstrate how inclusion of family and self -advocates as faculty, trainees, and partners will model effective approaches to person-/ family -centered care, including medical home concepts.

Document the research and scholarly activities of faculty and trainees that are relevant to individuals with ASD/DD. Describe how telehealth will be utilized to meet programmatic goals and expand the reach of the program, if applicable. 3) Continuing Education and Professional Development Continuing education (CE) activities offer practicing health professionals and others working in the ASD/DD and related fields opportunities to build knowledge and skills related to LEND topics. CE may be based on specific needs identified interactively wit h the group(s) to be served. CE may also target professionals in other fields to improve services, interactions with, and inclusion of people with disabilities. In the past, law enforcement, medical interpreters, educators, and primary care providers have received CE through LEND programs. Program Expectations Programs must conduct a minimum of three CE activities per year, such as conferences, workshops , or similar training activities designed to enhance skills or disseminate new information. Programs must track and report CE participation in annual performance reports (see Reporting ). For the purpose of tracking participants, CE participants are distinct from trainees. CE participants are practicing professionals who engage in a seminar or course for continuing professional development. CE participants are not enrolled in a formal degree or certificate program, though they may receive CE credits. In your application: Describe how the LEND program will assess CE needs and market its capabilities. Describe the CE activities that your organization is prepared to offer . Describe how your program will ensure it provides a minimum of three CE activities per year. HRSA -21-041 22 4) Technical Assistance /Consultation Technical Assistance ( TA) refers to mutual problem solving and collaboration on a range of issues. This may include the provision of clinical services, program development, program evaluation, needs assessment, and policy and guidelines formulation, as well as site visits and review/advisory functions. The TA effort may be a one-time encounter or an on-going activity of brief or extended frequency depending on the needs of the organization, and may be geared to the needs of several states or a specific region. Program Expectations The program should provide TA/consultation to the field. Of particular interest to MCHB is TA to support and improve the system of care for individuals with ASD/DD. It is encouraged that both LEND faculty and trainees be involved in the provision of TA when appropriate. Programs must track and report on TA that has been provided in annual performance reports (see Reporting ). In your application: Discuss how the LEND program will assess TA needs and market its capabilities. Describe the type of TA activities that your organization is prepared to offer . 5) Program Collaboration Partnerships with other organizations are often vital to the success of LEND training program s. For example, state Title V agencies and state and local home visiting implementing agencies may provide opportunities for LEND program s to collaborate, thereby enhancing and expanding services for children with neurodevelopmental disabilities and special health care needs. LEND programs may collaborate with systems and organizations serving youth and adults with ASD/DD and self - advocacy organizations to support successful transition to adulthood. In addition, HRSA -supported health centers may provide training sites and other experiences for trainees. Autism CARE S-funded research networks may also give LEND trainees valuable exposure to research fundamentals. Other organizational partnerships that might be beneficial to LEND programs are: Systems already serving children with ASD/DD such as Title V, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Part C and Part B, home visiting, early care and education, and early childhood comprehensive systems programs. Other federal programs addressing ASD/DD including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (ADDM Network, Learn the Signs. Act Early. Campaign), and the HRSA -21-041 23 Administration for Community Living (ACL) University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities (UCEDDs). Pediatric Mental Health Care Access Programs may provide opportunities for LEND trainees and faculty to support practicing providers in addressing behavioral health concerns through consultation and education. Other MCHB training and research investments, including, but not limited to, Autism CARES -funded programs in your region (State Systems recipients ; research networks; Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics (DBP) training programs, and other LEND training programs). Other LEND programs via partnerships supported by the Interdisciplinary Technical Assistance Center on ASD/DD (ITAC), such as workgroups and regional groups. Program Expectations Coordinate activities and collaborate with other MCHB -supported training and research programs, especially Autism CARES -funded programs. Coordinate with entities that will improve access to services and enhance systems of care for individuals with ASD/DD. In your application: Briefly describe existing or new partnerships that will strengthen your LEND program including those with academic and community organizations, and with entities that will provide strong clinical placements for trainees. Include, in Attachment 3, select copies of agreements, letters of understanding/ commitment or similar documents from key organizations/individuals , of their willingness to perform in accordance with what is presented in the application. If necessary, an additional list of agreements can be provided due to page limit constraints . 6) Project Dissemination and Sustainability As programs revise and develop new curricular materials, teaching models, other educational resources , and research findings, these products should be disseminated to other relevant programs, including, but not limited to, other grants funded under the Autism CARES Act of 2019. Program Expectations HRSA expects recipients to sustain key elements of their projects (e.g., strategies or services and interventions which have been effective in improving practices , and those that have led to impr oved outcomes for the target population) beyond the federal funding period. Programs are expected to disseminate findings in scholarly journals, at professional meetings, and to other appropriate disability stakeholders. Programs should develop plans for sustaining the program beyond federal funding. In your application: HRSA -21-041 24 Describe how you will disseminate project curricula, products, research results (if any), and training approaches. Describe the extent to which project results and products may be nati onal in scope, and the degree to which the project activities will be shared with other stakeholders. Discuss your approach to project sustainability after the period of federal funding ends. WORK PLAN AND LOGIC MODEL -- Corresponds to Section V's Review C riteria 2: Response and 5: Impact A work plan is critical in planning and describing the activities of the proposed training program, including how training will be implemented and evaluated. A work plan is a chart of the activities or steps that will be used to achieve each of the activities proposed in the Methodology section. A logic model is a succinct diagram that presents the conceptual framework for a proposed project and explains the links among program elements. A logic model illustrates the relationship between a program's activities and its intended outcomes. The logic model should summarize the connections between the: Process and outcomes of the program Activities and program inputs Short and intermediate outcomes Long-term outcomes and impact of the program Although there are similarities, a logic model is not a work plan. A work plan is an \"action\" guide with a time line used during program implementation; the w ork plan provides the \"how to\" steps. Program Expectations Programs are expected to formulate a work plan and logic model to guide the implementation of their programs. The logic model in Appendix B is a conceptual model of the national LEND initiative. This may also serve as a sample format for your logic model submission, which can be as short as 1-page. In your application: The narrative should include a brief descriptive overview referencing the work plan and logic model. Include the work plan and logic model in Attachment 1. The work plan should describe each training activity, didactic, clinical and practicum, with regard to purpose, methodology, content, time commitment, and method of evaluation. The work plan should include a timeline with all planned activities for the entire period of performance (5 years). HRSA -21-041 25 The work plan should i dentify responsible staff and, as appropriate, meaningful support and collaboration with key stakeholders in planning, designing, and implementing all activities. The logic model should describe program process and outcomes, identifying inputs and outputs contributing to the expected outcome measures. RESOLUTION OF CHALLE NGES -- Corresponds to Section V's Review Criterion 2: Response Programs are likely to encounter challenges in implementation. Examples include, challenges pertaining to trainee recruitment; having too few appropriately qualified, university -affiliated faculty disciplines; and insuf ficient interdisciplinary clinical opportunities. Program Expectations Anticipate challenges you are likely to encounter during implementation and develop strategies to address those challenges. Build on previous approaches to addressing challenges. In your application: Discuss challenges that you are likely to encounter in designing and implementing the activities described in the work plan. Describe approaches that you will use to resolve identified challenges. EVALUATION AND TECHN ICAL SUPPORT CAPAC ITY -- Corresponds to Section V's Review Criteria 3: Evaluative Measures and 5: Impact A strong evaluation protocol, managed by qualified staff, is necessary to docum ent program processes, inputs, outputs, and impacts. Mechanisms for monitoring progress towards the goals and objectives of the project and implement ing continuous quality improvement of the LEND program are also vital components of the evaluation. In addi tion to evaluating your individual LEND program, programs may participate in LEND network quality improvement efforts to assess the impact of LEND programs nationally. Program Expectations The evaluation should assess experiences of long-, medium -, and s hort-term trainees and their attainment of the desired skills and competencies. The evaluation should also assess the quality of the CE and TA provided. Section VI. 3. Reporting describes required data c ollection and reporting of performance data to MCHB. This includes tracking of former trainees to collect data via follow -up surveys in years 2, 5, and 10 following completion of LEND . If your evaluation may involve human subjects research as described i n 45 CFR part 46, you must comply with the regulations for the protection of human subjects , as applicable. HRSA -21-041 26 In your application: Describe the overall evaluation strategy to address program goals and objectives, and ongoing quality improvement efforts. Describe the data collection strategy to collect, analyze, and track data to measure process and impact/outcomes . Explain how the data will be used to inform program improvement and service delivery. Describe the systems and processes that will support the organization's tracking and collection of MCHB -required performance measures. Describe how you will track former trainees to collect data via follow -up surveys in years 2, 5, and 10 following completion of LEND . Include a description of who will collect and manage data and their experience in refining, collecting, and analyzing data. Describe the proposed LEND program's expertise and resources to implement the proposed evaluation. Describe the approaches to assess experiences for short -, medium -, and long- term trainees. Describe the plans to assess the quality of the CE and TA provided. Describe any efforts that will be used to inform program improvement across the LEND network. Describe any potential obstacles for implementing the program performance evaluation and how you will address those obstacles. ORGANIZATIONAL INFOR MATION -- Corresponds to Section V's Review Criterion 4: Resources/Capabilities Successful LEND programs are housed within organizations that have a mission and structure that will provide the infrastructure necessary to successfully implement the program. Established training programs within your organization and/or documented access to training programs will enable the LEND program to recrui t graduate students in the disciplines included in the application. Partnerships with graduate programs in other institutions can provide opportunities to expanded interdisciplinary experiences through access to trainees, faculty, and clinical opportunities. Program Expectations LEND LTTs should meet regularly as a cohort to have interdisciplinary discussions and experiences to become effective interdisciplinary colleagues appreciating each other's disciplines and perspectives. The training plan and sett ings should be structured to ensure sufficient formal interaction and informal association among trainees and faculty across disciplines to accomplish and enhance the interdisciplinary process and practice on which the program is based. The program shoul d consider using web-based technology for communication and information acquisition and processing, including distance learning modalities for CE. Programs should use available technologies such as e-learning systems, course management software, web-based conferencing, social media, and social networking tools to facilitate adult learning. O ptional online curriculum resources HRSA -21-041 27 are now available through the Association of University Centers on Disability (AUCD) and may be used to support LEND programs ' didactic training. Faculty and staff office space, classrooms, audiovisual and computer resources should be available to the program and be at least at the level available to other comparable programs in the institution. The primary program setting should provide sufficient and appropriate spaces for core faculty and trainee offices and for clinical and teaching activities . The organization must have the infrastructure in place to ensure that s ettings, materials, and curricula are accessible for all participants, including trainees and faculty. LEND Project Director The institution should have appropriate leadership and faculty in place to implement the LEND training program. The role of proj ect director (PD) shall constitute a major professional responsibility and time commitment of the person appointed to the position. The LEND PD should be a board-certified pediatrician, or a health professional with a doctorate degree, representing one of the disciplines mentioned below, or a currently approved LEND PD . LEND PDs are expected to have a minimum of 5, preferably 7 or more, years of experience in programs serving children with developmental disabilities, neurodevelopmental disabilities, and other special health care needs. The PD should have direct, functional responsibility for the program for which support is directed. The PD is expected to commit a minimum of 30 percent effort on this project . While it is acceptable to have co-directors, onl y one PD is formally recognized by HRSA on the notice of award ( NOA) and will receive key HRSA communications. The recognized PD is not a shared posi tion, as the PD listed on the NO A is expected to commit a minimum of 30 percent of time to the project. The PD recognized as such on the NOA is responsible for ensuring the proper use of the MCH training grant and will be expected to attend LEND and related meetings, or designate another program representative, and is expected to work directly with the MCHB PO. Faculty Individuals serving as c ore faculty members under the funded LEND program should have the primary responsibility for planning, designing, implementing, supervising, recruiting, mentoring trainees, and evaluating all training and service elements of the LEND program. The purpose of providing grant support for faculty salaries is to ensure dedicated time for meeting the objectives of the training program. The complexity associated with interdisciplinary education demands specific faculty qualific ations, commitment, and dedication. Each LEND training program should have both core and supporting faculty members. Core faculty members form the interdisciplinary program leadership team and commit a portion of their HRSA -21-041 28 full-time equivalent ( FTE) to LEND. Supporting faculty members participate in LEND for less time, as a mentor, or lecturer for a course, etc. Distinctions between core and supporting faculty are further specified below. Additionally, LEND programs may assign faculty and staff to various roles to facilitate the structure and functioning of the program. These roles may include a training director, training coordinators, evaluators, a data coordinator, etc., and may be outlined in the organizational chart included in Attachment 4. It is important that LEND faculty represent different disciplines and also represent the racial and ethnic diversity of the community. This will encourage a diverse cohort of trainees that reflects the population. Faculty Disciplines Each funding level requires a mi nimum number of disciplines represented by the LEND faculty , see Table 2: Allowable Funding Levels . Participation of faculty from other relevant disciplines is encouraged. LEND faculty may be selected from the following discipli nes: Applied Behavioral Analysis Occupational Therapy Audiology Pediatric or Adult Dentistry Disability Studies Physical Therapy Family (required of all programs) Psychology Human Genetics/Genetic Counseling Public Health Policy Health Administra tion School Psychology/School Counseling Medicine/Pediatrics Self-advocacy (required by year 3) Medicine/Adult (focused on serving individuals with ASD/DD) Social Work Nursing Speech -Language Pathology Nutrition Special Education/Education While M CHB recognizes that specialties/subspecialties of medicine are distinct, any specialties that are listed under \"medicine, pediatric providers\" will count as a single discipline towards meeting the interdisciplinary requirements listed in Table 2: Allowable Funding Levels . The same applies to \"medicine, adult providers.\" This will ensure that faculty cohorts represent a wide array of clinical and non-clinical perspectives . Regardless of discipline, core faculty members should have experience in providing academic, clinical, and/or community -based training in disabilities and a commitment to improving the lives of those with ASD/DD through their teaching. Core faculty are expected to: Meet the minimum standards of education, experience, and certification/licensure generally accepted by their respective professions. HRSA -21-041 29 Demonstrate leadership and have teaching and clinical experience in providing health and related services to the special health care needs of the population on which the program is focused. Be able to document knowledge and experience in person-/family -centered care or the project must provide appropriate CE for faculty to achieve these competencies. Key faculty members on the interdisciplinary team should include indivi duals who have lived experience with ASD/DD, both personally (self -advocates) and as family members. LEND Performance Measure, Training 01 measures the extent to which programs ensure family/youth/community member participation in program and policy activi ties. All grants are expected to support at least one family faculty member to bring the family perspective to trainees. This could include teaching, mentoring, coordinating family experiences for trainees, advising other LEND faculty on family perspecti ves, etc. For information about how the role of families in LEND has evolved, as well as resources for the various types of family involvement in LEND, please refer to the white paper from the AUCD Family Discipline Workgroup, Fabric not Fringe: Weaving Family Involvement throughout Training and Practice for Professionals and Advocates Working with Individuals with Disabilities and Special Health Care Needs . Self-advocates should be engaged from the outset of the grant . By year 3, the program is expected to include at least one self -advocate faculty member to support the required self -advocate trainee and provide guidance to the entire trainee cohort. This role can include teaching, mentoring, coordinating community experiences for trainees, advising other faculty on personal perspectives, planning training, and developing curriculum. Individuals with disabilities and/or parents/siblings of individuals with disabilities who consult to your program or serve as faculty/staff members must be financially compensated. In some instances, not all academic disciplines of the faculty members listed may be regionally located or pr oximal to the home institution. If so, flexibility is permitted to the extent that alternative arrangements are academically and educationally acceptable and appropriate, and patient care is acceptable and uncompromised. These arrangements must be clearly specified in the application. Programs are expected to accord recognition for each core faculty member, in the form of an academic appointment in the appropriate degree-granting school or department of his/her profession in the recipient and/or an affiliated institution of higher learning. This appointment is in addition to the core faculty member's appointment in the employing institute/center program. It shall be the responsibility of the appointing academic school or department to determine the basic qualifications and the responsibility of the employing program to determine and document the additional specialized pediatric training and clinical experience required. Core faculty members should be responsible to the LEND PD for the HRSA -21-041 30 time allocated to the LEND project. It is understood that some family faculty and self-advocate faculty members may not have an academic appointment, but serve as faculty members for the purposes of the LEND grant only. Individuals from other disciplines who do not hav e academic appointments may participate on LEND as a core faculty with approval from the PO, after award. Faculty Roles and Responsibilities Core faculty members are also the chief representatives of their respective disciplines in the program. As such, they: Have responsibility, with other core faculty members, for planning, implementing, coordinating, and ensuring supervision of all training and service elements of their discipline, with special emphasis on ASD/DD. Collaborate with all core faculty members to develop and refine the interdisciplinary curriculum of the LEND for all trainees. Define appropriate criteria for recruitment of trainees of their discipline and jointly select trainees with the appropriate academic school or department and the trai ning director and/or committee. Serve as the primary liaison between the program and their professional associates, academic affiliates, clinical departments, and discipline counterparts in state and community programs. Provide a neurodevelopmental disabi lity perspective to trainees outside of LEND across their institution of higher learning. Represent their discipline on internal program, policy, or committees. Provide supervision and professional leadership for other LEND faculty of their discipline. Engage in scholarship related to MCH populations, especially those with ASD/DD. Participate in LEND network workgroups on emerging areas in the field of ASD/DD. Serve as mentors to LEND long-term trainees. If your program has trainees with disabilities, whenever possible, the faculty mentor for these trainees should be an individual with disabilities or should have had experience supporting individuals with disabilities. In your application, the Organizational Capacity section should: Describe the organization within whic h the LEND program will be run, including its mission, structure, and scope of activities , and how these elements all contribute to the organization's ability to implement the program requirements and meet program expectations. Describe the administrative and organizational structure within which the program will function, including relationships with other departments, institutions, organizations , or agencies relevant to the program. Include an organizational chart outlining organizational structures as Attachment 4. Discuss how the organization will follow the approved work plan and budget, as outlined in the application, properly account for the federal funds, and document all costs to avoid audit findings. HRSA -21-041 31 Describe your organization's r elevant past performance implementing a similar training program reaching interdisciplinary trainees and/or serving individuals with disabilities, if applicable. Describe any established training programs and/or access to training programs that you will use to recruit graduate students in the disciplines included in the application. Describe briefly the settings in which the program will take place. Describe the telecommunications capability of the program, particularly i f the curriculum will be delivered remotely, or accessed remot ely by any trainees or faculty. Describe how the program will utilize available technologies (such as e- learning systems, course management software, web-based conferencing, social media, and social networking tools) to fac ilitate instruction. Explain how the physical and virtual training environments will maximize participation of trainees and faculty from multiple disciplines to ensure an interdisciplinary experience. Describe your organization's plan for ensuring that curricul a, materials, and virtual and physical settings are accessible for all participants. In your application, the Project Director and Faculty section should: Describe the proposed PD's experience and expertise meeting the qualifications required. Describe how the PD will fulfill the administrative responsibilities and time commitment required. Describe the proposed core LEND faculty and their qualifications to meet core faculty requirements , including core faculty with expertise in ASD/DD. Include biographic al sketches in the SF -424 RESEARCH & RELATED Senior Key Person Profile form that can be accessed in the Application Package under \"Mandatory.\" Even though the document has an OMB clearance number, it is not a standard form but a format , and so biographical sketches do count against the page limit. Include a staffing plan and job descriptions for key personnel in Attachment 2 (Staffing Plan and Job Descriptions for Key Personnel ). Include position descriptions identifying the qualifications necessary to meet the functional requirements of the position, not the particular capabilities or qualifications of a given individual. A position description should not exceed one page in length, but can be as short as one paragraph in length due to page limitations. Describe the approach you will use to ensure the program recruits faculty from a minimum number of faculty disciplines, as required by the selected funding level from Table 2: Allowable Funding Levels . Describe the program's approac h to recruiting and retaining a diverse faculty cohort. Describe how the program will include a minimum of one compensated family faculty member. Describe how the program will recruit and compensate a self-advocate faculty member by year 3, if the program does not currently have involvement of a self-advocate faculty member . HRSA -21-041 32 Include development of effective tools and strategies for ongoing faculty and staff training, including leadership training and skills. iii. Budget -- Corresponds to Section V's Review Cr iterion 6: Support Requested The directions offered in the SF-424 R&R Application Guide may differ from those offered by Grants.gov. Follow the instructions in Section 4.1.iv of HRSA's SF-424 R&R Application Guide and the additional budget instructions provided below. A budget that follows the R&R Application Guide will ensure that, if HRSA selects the application for funding, you will have a well -organized plan and, by carefully following the approved plan, may avoid audit issues during the implementation phase. Reminder: The Total Project or Program Costs are the total allowable costs (inclusive of direct and indirect costs) you incur to carry out a HRSA -supported project or activity. Total project or program costs include costs charged to the award and costs borne by you to satisfy a matc hing or cost -sharing requirement , as applicable. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-94), Division A, \u00a7 202 states, \" None of the funds appropriated in this title shall be used to pay the salary of an individual, through a grant or other extramural mechanism, at a rate in excess of Executive Level II.\" See Section 4.1.iv Budget - Salary Limitation of HRSA's SF-424 R&R Application Guide for additional information. Note that these or other salary limitations may apply in the following fiscal years, as required by law. Indirect costs under training awards to organizations other than state, local , or Indian tribal governments will be budgeted and reimbur sed at 8 percent of modified total direct costs rather than on the basis of a negotiated rate agreement, and are not subject to upward or downward adjustment. Direct cost amounts for equipment, tuition and fees, and subawards and subcontracts in excess of $25,000 are excluded from the direct cost base for purposes of this calculation. HRSA -21-041 33 The allowable funding levels per program per year are based on criteria in the table below. Table 2: Allowable Funding Levels Funding Level Funding Range Minimum Number of Long-term Trainees Minimum Number of Trainee and Faculty Disciplines Other Notes Tier 1 Up to $464,000 9 7 This funding level applies to all applicants that are not LEND recipients in the 2016- 2021 grant cycle. It may also apply to certain competing continuation applicants. Tier 2 $464,001 - 554,000 12 8 For competing continuation applicants, see below for evidence required to meet the funding range proposed. Tier 3 $554,001 - 645,000 18 10 Tier 4 $645,001 - 738,000 29 12 Competing continuation applicants may propose to stay in the same tier as in the previous grant cycle, may propose to move up one tier , or may propose to move down to a lower tier . If you are a competing continuation LEND applicant , provide in Attach ment 7, the average number of LTTs trained for any 4 of the 5 years during the last period of performance. Use a tool similar to the one provided to document your calculation. This will provide evidence that the program can recruit and train the number of LTTs listed per year in the funding category for which they are applying. To qualify for a given funding level, this average must be no less than one fewer than the number listed for the funding level in this table. For previous audiology supplement reci pients, the average number of trainees reported m ay not include the two audiology LTTs required by the supplement. The minimum number of disciplines required for each funding level should be represented by both faculty and trainees. For example, in tier 4 there must be a minimum of 12 disciplines represented by the core and supporting faculty and 12 disciplines represented among the trainees. This will ensure an interdisciplinary HRSA -21-041 34 program for each cohort. The composition of the trainee and faculty disciplines may be different. The total program costs requested must be within the same funding range for all 5 years . All LEND LTTs must complete 300+ hours of LEND -specific leadership and core curriculum requirements, above their usual graduate disciplinary training requirements. All trainees being counted as LTTs must be tracked for 10 years and reported to HRSA , see Reporting section for more information. iv. Budget Justification Narrative -- Corresponds to Section V's Review Criterion 6: Support Requested A budget narrative provides details to justify the proposed costs outlined on the line- item budget form. For complete instructions on what to include in the budget narrative see Secti on 4.1.v of HRSA's SF-424 R&R Application Guide . Program Expectations The budget narrative must fully explain the resources needed to accomplish the LEND training object ives. In your application, the budget narrative should include: The budget narrative supports the proposed project activities. The number of masters level, pre-doctoral, and post -doctoral LEND trainees planned and a clear description of how many stipends will be supported by the grant . A description of the compensation for family and self -advocate trainees and faculty for the project. The costs associated with training short - and/or medium -term trainees. Costs related to provision of CE and TA. A state ment indicating that the project director's time commitment to the LEND program will meet the expected minimum of 30 percent time. While other funds may be used to support this effort, the budget narrative should demonstrate dedicated time to meet this requirement.

If faculty time for LEND will be supported by other funds, please indicate this in the budget narrative. A description of travel funds requested, indicating that at least one LEND program representative will attend the required meetings below . A project director, co-director, or training director are considered program representatives for this purpose. Up to two LEND recipient meetings per year in the Washington, DC area. Each year, one recipient meeting will be in conjunction with the AUCD annual meeting in the late fall. The Autism CARES recipient meeting which is usually held every other year in Washington, DC and virtually in other years. In-person meetings HRSA -21-041 35 are anticipated to occur in 2021, 2023, and 2025, but are subject to change. A clear statement about the funding level f or which the program qualifies. New applicants should request Tier 1 funding only. Competing continuation applicants can propose to move up no more than one funding tier, remain in the same funding tier , or move to a lower tier.

See Section 4.1.v of HRSA's SF-424 R&R Application Guide. You may request up to $50,000, inclusive of up to 8 percent indirect costs, for the proposed supplement. Attachment 7: Funding Tier Calculation Instructions (Required for Competing Continuation Applicants Only ) If you are a c ompeting continuation applicant , use data from previous years to determine the funding tier for which you are eligible to apply rather than the funding tier at which you are currently funded. Submit information in a chart , which may be similar to the one below , to indicate the funding tier for which your institution is eligible. As indicated in the table, eligibility will be based on LTT data from 4 of the 5 years in the FY 2016 - FY 2020 LEND funding cycle. In Column 2, enter \"N/A\" in the row that corresponds with the year for which you have chosen not to include in your trainee calculation. The number of LTTs entered must match the number reported in your annual performance reports in HRSA' s Electronic Handbook (EHB s) for years 1 through 4. Data for year 5 have not yet been entered in the EHB s. If you choose to calculate your 4-year average using trainee data for year 5, please enter the number of LTTs CURRENTLY enrolled. To qualify for a funding tier, your calculated average may be one less than the LTT minimum required for that tier (see Table 2: Allowable Funding Levels ). The chart below provides a sample calculation. For previous audiology supplement recipients , the average number of trainees reported may not include the two audiology LTTs required by the supplement. LEND Funding Year Number of Long -T erm Trainees Reported in EHB s July 1, 2016 - June 30, 2017 18 July 1 , 2017 - June 30, 2018 16 July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 18 July 1, 2019 - June 30, 2020 N/A July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2021 * 17 (LTTs currently enrolled , not yet reported in EHB s) Average number of LTTs for the selected 4 years above: 17.25* (round to 17) * Please round up for 0.5 and above, and down for 0.49 and below. Allowable Funding Level = Rounded 4-year average + 1 17 + 1 = 18 trainees Tier 3 requires a minimum of 18 trainees HRSA -21-041 39 In addition to providing this historical data, the trainee recruitment approach described in the narrative shoul d clearly demonstrate that you will meet the requirements in Table 2, Allowable Funding Levels . Attachments 8-15: Other Relevant Documents Include here any other documents that are relevant to the application, including letters of support. Letters of support must be dated and specifically indicate a commitment to the project/program (in-kind services, dollars, staff, space, equipment, etc.) . 3. Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number Transition to the Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) and System for Award Management (SAM) You must obtain a valid DUNS number , also known as the Unique Entity Identifier (UEI), and provide that number in the application. In April 2022, the *DUNS number will be replaced by the UEI , a \"new, non-proprietary identifier\" requested in, and assigned by, the System for Award Management (SAM.gov).

Trainees are qualified to participate if they are currently achieving an advanced degree (pre-doctoral), are family members or self -advocates, or are practicing professionals from the community with graduate degrees or commensurate work or leadership experience. Long-term trainee status is independent of a trainee's enrollment status at the academic institution (based on credit hours and/or academic units per term). 2. A long-term fellow is an individual enroll ed for 300+ hours in the LEND training program. Fellows are post -doctoral and have met at least the minimum standards of education and experience accepted by their respective professions. Long-term fellow status is independent of a fellow's enrollment status at the academic institution (based on credit hours and/or academic units per term). 3. An advanced medium -term trainee is an individual enrolled in LEND for 150- 299 hours of training. Stipends for advanced medium -term trainees are at the discretion of the recipient . Trainee status is independent of a trainee's enrollment status at the academic institution (based on credit hours and/or academic units per term). 4. A stipend is allowable as cost -of-living allowances for trainees. A stipend is not a fee-for -service payment and is not subject to the cost accounting requirements of the cost principles.20 This is also known as a \"participant support cost\" per the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements at 45 CFR part 75 . B. Qualifications for receiving stipends/tuition/salary support under this program 1. Trainees/fellows receiving stipends or salary under this program will generally be long-term trainees. Stipends for advanced medium -term trainees are allowable and may be provided at the discretion of the recipient . 2. Tuition support may be provided to LEND trainees/fellows enrolled full-time or part-time for academic credits . 3. A long-term LEND trainee must have at least a baccalaureate degree and be enrolled in a graduate program , or must be participating as a family member, self-advocate, or as a practicing professional. 20 HHS Grants Policy Statement (https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/grants/hhsgrantspolicy .pdf) HRSA -21-041 52 4. A long-term LEND fellow must have achieved the academic degree and completed requisite training which constitutes the basic professional level training for his/her field. 5. A special trainee or fellow may be approved, upon request to the MCHB PO after award, only in those unusual circumstances where particular needs cannot be met within the categories described above. 6. Citizenship - The trainee or fellow receiving a stipend must be a citizen or a non- citizen national of the United States or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residenc e, as evidenced by a currently valid Permanent Resident Card [USCIS Form I -551] or other legal verification of such status, by the start of the training grant, fellowship or traineeship, or award. A non-citizen national is a person who, although not a citi zen of the United States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States. 7. Licensure - For any profession for which licensure is a prerequisite, the trainee/fellow must also be licensed by one of the states, or, in the case of foreign graduates, meet other requirements which legally qualify him/her to practice his/her profession in the United States. C. Restrictions 1. Only long-term and advanced medium -term trainees may receive stipends from the grant funds. 2. Concurrent Support - Stipends or salary generally w ill not be made available under this program to persons receiving a salary, fellowship, or traineeship stipend, or other financial support related to his/her training or employment for the same hours counted toward his/her HRSA -funded traineeship/fellowshi p. Exceptions to these restrictions may be requested to the MCHB PO, after award, and will be considered on an individual basis. 3. Non-Related Duties - The funding recipient shall not use funds from this award to require trainees or fellows to perform any duties which are not directly related to the purpose of the training for which the grant was awarded. 4. Field Training - Funded recipients may not utilize grant funds to support field training, except when such training is part of the specified requirements of a LEND training program, or is authorized in the approved application. 5. Grant funds may be used for costs associated with reasonable modifications and accommodations for trainees with disabilities, however, these costs are not to be deducted from trainee stipends. HRSA -21-041 53 6. Grant funds may not be used: a) For the support of any trainee who would not, in the judgment of the recipient, be able to use the training or meet the minimum qualifications specified in the approved plan for the training. b) To continue the support of a trainee who has failed to demonstrate satisfactory participation in the training program . c) For support of candidates for undergraduate or pre-professional degrees or credentials. D. Trainee Costs 1. Allowable Costs :21 a) Stipends or salary (except as i ndicated above) . b) Tuition and fees .22 c) Travel related to training and field placements (international travel requests will require prior approval) . d) Post-doctoral/post -residency fellows may be supported via stipend or salary: a. If supported on salary, fringe benefits are an allowable cost. b. If supported via stipend, medical insurance is an allowable cost. 2. Non-Allowable Costs : 21 a) Dependent/family member allowances . b) Daily commuting costs. c) Fringe benefits or deductions which normally apply only to persons with the status of an employee. 3. Programmatic Restriction: A LTT stipend is allowed for the completion of 300+ hours of LEND training. For trainees approved to complete long-term LEND training over 2 years , their stipend may be prorated over the course of their training. 4. Stipend Levels The Division of MCH Workforce Development (DMCHWD) has adopted stipend levels established by Kirschstein-National Research Service Awards (NRSA) for trainees and fellows (pre-doctoral and post -doctoral). Dollar amounts indicated in this NOFO are subject to update by the NIH as reflected in this issuance. All approved stipends indicated are for a full calendar year and must be prorated for the training period, as appropriate. The stipend levels may, for the DMCHWD , be treated as ceilings rather than mandatory amounts, i.e., stipends may be less than but may not exceed the amounts indicated. However, where lesser amounts are awarded, the awarding institution must have established, written policy which identifies the basis or bases for such variation and which ensures equitable treatment for all eligible trainees/fellows . These stipend levels were updated on February 070.html \u00a7 75.466(a) ) and the HHS Grants Policy Statement (HHS GPS ). 22 Under 45 CFR 75.466(a), tuition remis s ion and other forms of compens ation paid as , or in lieu of, wages to s tudents (including fellows and trainees ) performing neces s ary work are allowable provided that there is a bona fide employer -employee relations hip between the s tudent and the ins titution for the work performed, the tuition or other payments are reas onable compens ation for the work performed and are conditioned explicitly upon the performance of neces s ary work , and it is the ins titution's practice to similarly compens ate s tudents in non- s pons ored as well as s pons ored activities . Other requirements als o apply. HRSA -21-041 54 Stipends for LEND LTTs may be supplemented by other federal funding sources to support additional LEND training that exceeds the required 300 hours. The terms of the federal program from which the supplemental funds are to be derived must authorize this practice. a) Pre-Doctoral trainee One stipend level is used for all pre-doctoral candidates, regardless of the level of experience. Career Level Years of Experience Stipend for FY 20 20 Monthly Stipend Pre-doctora l All $25,320 $2,110 b) Post -Doctoral fellow The stipend level for the entire first year of support is determined by the number of full years of relevant post -doctoral experience** when the award is issued. Relevant experience may include research experienc e (including industrial), teaching assistantship, internship, residency, clinical duties, or other time spent in a health-related field beyond that of the qualifying doctoral degree. Once the appropriate stipend level has been determined, the fellow must be paid at that level for the entire grant year. The stipend for each additional year of support is the next level in the stipend structure and does not change mid-year . These stipend levels should be used to guide support for post -doctoral and post - residency fellows whether supported via stipends or salary. Career Level Years of Experience Stipend for FY 20 20 Monthly of the \"years of relevant experience\" shall be made in accordance with program guidelines and will give credit to experience gained prior to entry into the grant -supported program as well as to prior years of participation in the grant - supported program. The appropriate number of \"years\" (of relevant experience) at the time of entry into the program will be determined as of the date on which the individual trainee begins his/her training rather than on the budget period beginni ng HRSA -21-041 55 date of the training grant. Stipends for subsequent years of support are at the next level on the stipend chart.
