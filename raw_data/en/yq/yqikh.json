Background The Welsh Assembly Government has adopted the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) as the basis for all of its policies and programmes for children and young people in W ales. The Assembly Government has translated the UNCRC into seven core aims: Core Aim 1 Every child should have a flying start in life and the best possible basis for their future growth and development. Core Aim 2 Every child and young person should have access to a comprehensive range of education, training and learning opportunities, including the acquisition of essential personal and social skills. Core Aim 3 Every child should enjoy the best possible physical and mental, social and emotional health, i ncluding freedom from abuse, victimisation and exploitation. Core Aim 4 All children should have access to play, leisure, sporting and cultural activities. Core Aim 5 All children and young people should be listened to, treated with respect and have their race and cultural identity recognised. Core Aim 6 All children and young people should have a safe home and community which supports physical and emotional wellbeing. Core Aim 7 No child or young person should be disadvantaged by poverty. In 2008, the Ass embly Government published the first Children and Young People's Wellbeing Monitor for Wales1, reporting on a variety of health and wellbeing indicators and research evidence structured around the core aims. The Support Unit for Research Evidence was com missioned to undertake a comprehensive evidence review of relevant research, in order to inform and support development of the 2011 Monitor. Project Objectives The objectives of the evidence review were to: 1 Welsh Assembly Government. 2008 Children and Young People's Well -being Monitor for Wales . November 2008. I.Develop a search strategy. II. Search the literatu re. III. Critically appraise appropriate studies that meet defined inclusion criteria. IV. Summarise the literature in data audit forms. V. Provide the completed data audit forms and a final report to the Client.2. Methods 2.1 Inclusion Criteria Topics and Popula tion of interest The review aimed to identify observational research on the wellbeing of children and young people (aged between 0 -25 years), that related to the seven core aims presented in section 1. A s chema was devised and agreed with the Client to o utline the type of information the evidence review should seek to identify for each core aim. Particular emphasis was placed on seeking research to address evidence gaps identified in the 2008 Monitor. Data already available to the Monitor authors was not covered by the evidence review (e.g. studies recently commissioned by the Assembly Government to address the core aims, or data provided by the Statistics for Wales). This data was outlined in the agreed Schema. Study Design, Country of Origin, Date and Language Range Quantitative, qualitative, or mixed method observational studies were eligible for inclusion. Systematic reviews of these study designs were also included. To be considered eligible, the review reports needed to include a search strategy, present the results of the included studies and assess their quality. Quantitative studies were restricted to a sample size of 200 participants or more, whereas qualitative studies of any sample size were considered. Case series, case reports, discussio n papers, editorials and letters were excluded along with studies only available as an abstract. To maximise generalisability to a Welsh setting, systematic reviews were considered if they included at least one recent UK study; and observational primary studies were eligible if they included Wales -based data. Publications that did not identify where the research was conducted, but met all remaining criteria, were included. Where more than one study was identified for a given topic, a 'best available' evidence approach was taken to populate the review. This considered the reliability and generalisability of the evidence identified. For example if a relevant systematic review addressed a specific area, further papers reporting single primary studies were not included. The review was confined to English or Welsh language studies published from 2003 to date. Furthermore, to ensure findings were based on recent research, studies were excluded if they only covered data prior to 2000. 2.2 Search Strategy A com prehensive literature search across all topic areas was conducted between March and May 2010. Previous research has shown that a range of databases should be searched to obtain good sensitivity for topics relating to the health of the public2,3. It wa s also anticipated that there was likely to be rich data from the wealth of grey literature reports produced by governmental and non -governmental organisations and charities. These were identified through searching grey literature databases, and a wide ran ge of relevant websites. Information Sources The range of information sources used for the evidence review are listed below: Databases General Health/Biomedical British Nursing Index Medline Medline in Process Embase Social Care and Social SciencesASSIA Social Science Citation Index Social Care Online Sociological Abstracts Specialist ERIC (Education research literature) PsycINFO (Psychological literature) Grey Literature Health Management Information Consortium ( HMIC) Open SIGLE Websites Children's Organisations Barnardo's Childline Children in Wales Dept for Children, Schools and Families/Department for Education Healthy Schools Programme (NHSP) National Children's Bureau NSPCC Princes Trust Save the Children The Children's Society UNICEF Wales Childrens Commissioner Funky Dragon Cross -cutting websites Welsh Assembly Government (including Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills; Health and Social Services; Social Justice and Local Government; Equality; Housing) Education Future Skills Wales General Teaching Council (Wales) 2 Weaver N, Williams JL, Weightman AL et al. 2002.

The search strategy was developed in Medline, and tested and refined a gainst relevant papers. The final strategy was then adapted to the remaining databases. The Medline search strategy, using MeSH subject headings and search fields for text words in titles and abstracts, is presented in appendix 2. The search combined thre e main key concepts (Population, Study Design and Topic). A filter to remove primary studies conducted in non -UK countries was also applied. The list of search strategies used in all the databases are provided in the separate document entitled - 'Document B - Search History'. 2.3 Selection of Studies Search results were downloaded into the bibliographic software Reference Manager for sifting. Duplicate references and clearly irrelevant citations were removed first. Systematic reviews and possible Wales -based primary studies were then screened for relevance at title and abstract stage. The full -text of the remaining potentially relevant papers was then screened. A short list of included studies was agreed by consensus within the SURE team. The Social Resear ch Division and the authors of the Monitor chapters were then consulted to select the final list of papers for data extraction. The results of the screening process, including an illustrative flow diagram are shown in 3.1.2.4 Completion of Data Audit Fo rms Data audit forms (DAFs) were developed using Microsoft InfoPath. Data from the full text of each included paper were extracted into the data audit forms. All data audit forms were then completed by one reviewer and checked by a second. See 'Document C - DAF' for a template of the data audit form. The DAFs included a set of questions to assess the quality of the research study. The questions were adapted from study -specific critical appraisal checklists outlined in SURE's internationally recognised met hodology4. A brief summary of the quality of the research was provided in the 'quality' section of the data audit form. 4 Weightman AL, Mann MK, Sander L and Turley RL. Health Evidence Bulletins Wa les.

Results 3.1 Search Results The search resulted in 6,705 records identified from all information sources. This included 203 repor ts that were marked as potentially relevant, following comprehensive screening of publications hosted on the websites listed in section 2.2. 4,629 duplicates and clearly irrelevant citations were excluded (i.e. studies not conducted in Wales or the UK, e ditorials, letters and discussion papers). A further 1422 potentially relevant UK primary studies that did not include Wales based data were also removed. 654 potential systematic reviews or primary studies including data from W ales, were then sifted for further eligibility. 321 were excluded by reading the title, abstract or report summary. The full -text of 333 papers was screened for relevance (as outlined in the schema), eligible study design and location. The Monitor chapter authors and the Client wer e also consulted to agree the final 71 papers that were extracted into DAFs.
