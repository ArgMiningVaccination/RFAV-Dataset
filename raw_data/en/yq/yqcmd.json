Health care: Any type of service provided by professionals or paraprofessionals with an impact on health status Medical device: An article, instrument, apparatus or machine that is used in the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of illness or disease, or for detecting, measuring, restoring, correcting or modifying the structure or function of the body for some health purpose . Typically, the purpose of a medical device is not achieved by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means . Medical devices include medical equipment, surgical instruments, implantable medical devices, in vitro diagnostics, solutions and disinfection substances, clothing, accessories and single-use devices . Medical equipment: Medical devices requiring calibration, maintenance, repair, user training and decommissioning - activities usually managed by clinical engineers . Medical equipment is used for the specic purposes of diagnosis and treatment of disease or interventions provided during rehabilitation following disease or injury; it can be used either alone or in combination with any accessory, consumable, or other piece of medical equipment . Medical equipment excludes implantable, disposable or single-use medical devices . 1 A system of health accounts: 2011 edition . OECD, European Union and World Health Organization; 2011 (https:/ /www .who.int/health-accounts/methodology/sha2011 .pdf).GlossaryxvGlossary Medical furniture: Furniture used in medical settings (hospitals, or any other health care units) for medical purposes (for example, cabinets to store medical equipment) . Personal protective equipment and clothing: Personal protective equipment, commonly referred to as PPE, is equipment worn by health care workers to minimize exposure to a variety of hazards . Examples of PPE include such items as gloves, foot and eye protection, protective hearing devices (earplugs, muffs) hard hats, respirators, lead aprons and full body suits . This category includes the equipment used to cover and protect the patient, such as gowns and face masks . Priority assistive products: Those assistive products that are highly needed, an absolute necessity to maintain or improve an individual's functioning and which need to be available at a price the community/ state can afford . Priority medical devices: Those medical devices that are indispensable to perform a health intervention, of an evidence based clinical practice guideline of a priority diseases or health condition . These medical devices need to be of good quality, effective, appropriate, affordable, accessible and acceptable to the nal user . They need to be available to respond to the priority health needs of the setting and should be used safely by the health care worker or nal user . The priority medical devices, especially the ones that are most costly and complex, require specic infrastructure and trained human resources, and need an assessment process to evaluate if these can be placed for public procurement or considered in the package of interventions as a reimbursable procedure/product . These assessments consider not only the safety and efcacy of the technology, but also feasibility, cost effectiveness, ethical, organizational and human resources requirements . Those devices have specic intended use from prevention and protection to diagnosis, monitoring, treatment or palliation, to inform the development of national priority lists . Quality assurance equipment: Equipment clinically relevant to carry out a calibration process needs to meet international standards considering calibration factors . Also called auxiliary dosimetry equipment, for example ionization chambers, phantoms and chamber sleeves . Specic medical devices: Medical devices for diagnosis or treatment of a specic type of condition or disease and used for specic clinical intervention .xvi WHO list of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes In this publication, the priority medical devices that are discussed, selected and presented are organized by clinical unit in a health service provision . The navigation diagram in Figure 1 represents the range of health-related interventions, from pre-hospital activities to highly specialized tertiary hospital-based care . The selected clinical interventions, and thus the medical devices, are required throughout the continuum of care, from prevention, diagnosis and monitoring, treatment, intensive care, rehabilitation, to palliative care, in any of the following clinical areas: clinical assessment, emergency care, clinical laboratory, surgery, non- surgical interventions, intensive care, hospitalization, rehabilitation and palliative care .

They are indispensable for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, palliative care, and are used along the continuum of health service provision from primary care to specialized hospitals . Of the thousands types of medical devices currently available,2 the current challenge for health care providers and government institutions is to select which specic technologies are needed for the management of health conditons or high-burden diseases, at a given health care level and in a given context, to include in their national list . The increase in the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) demanded that the World Health Organization (WHO) identify appropriate and relevant medical devices and develop a prioritized list that can serve as a reference for Member States to develop or update their national lists of medical devices for public procurement, reimbursement, and tracking availability . The nal goal of this publication is to guide on the selection, in order to increase access to medical devices required to prevent, diagnose and treat cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, especially in low and middle resource settings . Objectives of this publication were to: determine and select the medical devices required for priority interventions to manage cardiovascular diseases and diabetes aligned with WHO guidance, policies and evidence-based guidelines; expand the WHO Priority Medical Devices lists, these now include reproductive, maternal, new born and child health, the ones for cancer management and the most recent ones for COVID-19, to those for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, which will become global guidances that Member States can use as a reference to dene their national medical devices lists; provide guidance to countries, national and regional health departments, and health facilities to prioritize medical devices for procurement or reimbursement to manage NCDs in their settings . For an overview of country implementation, the next steps are suggested: dene a system to undertake a medical device needs assessment in each target country, in conjunction with other United Nations and international organizations, with the aim of identifying the medical equipment required to address the national disease burden for NCD care at country level; organize local workshops on health technology regulatory frameworks, assessments and management for relevant national health ofcials, academics and other stakeholders in target countries, using existing WHO tools and resources to strengthen regional or national health deliver capacity . The rst section of this publication introduces the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), universal health coverage, and the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020, and presents global statistics for non communicable diseases . The second section presents the methodology used to select priority medical devices for the clinical interventions required to diagnose, treat and monitor patients living with those conditions . The third section lists priority medical devices required to manage all three conditions in different units of health care services, as follows: clinical assessment emergency care clinical laboratory specialized diagnostics medical imaging surgery non-surgical interventions hospitalization intensive care unit (ICU) rehabilitation palliative or end-of-life care 2 Standardization /apps .who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_les/EB145/B145_3-en .pdfExecutive summaryxix([HFXWLYH\u0003VXPPDU\\ \u0003 The lists include technologies required to support general clinical interventions (some of which were presented in previous WHO documents), as well as specic priority medical devices to manage cardiovascular diseases and diabetes . To facilitate budget planning and procurement, medical devices are classied either as capital equipment or as accessories, consumables, software or single-use devices . In addition, each section provides information on the clinical unit . The fourth section proposes the strategies required in settings where the presented lists of priority medical devices are to be implemented . The activities include performing a needs assessment, cross-referencing and adjusting medical device lists according to country priorities, infrastructure, specialized human resources available, and budget . It is important to note that high-impact technologies (for example, those with high cost or requiring radical organizational changes) for specialized hospitals may require a comprehensive health technology assessment considering contextual variables and local settings . The annexes include the expert information, search terms and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) Extent of Adherence to Trustworthy Standards (NEATS) instrument for selection of clinical guidelines, as well as the list of clinical interventions selected in this study . This publication is intended for ministries of health, public health planners, health technology managers, disease managers, researchers, policy-makers, funding and procurement agencies, and support and advocacy groups for patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases and diabetes . It serves to inform policy-makers and technical decision-makers on the selection of medical devices required for the package of benets and interventions for a target population in the context of universal health coverage, to be considered in their national medical devices list . Special acknowledgments go to all experts involved in the development of this document, who collaborated with the main goal of helping Member States, NGOs, academia, and the private sector, to improve management of patients worldwide, and especially in low-resource settings .1I. Background I.I. Sustainable development goals (SDG) In 2015, all States Members of the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development . The Agenda is based on 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries, at all stages of development, to cooperate in a global partnership for sustainable development (Figure 1) .3 The SDGs recognize that ending poverty must go hand in hand with strategies that build economic growth and address a range of social needs, including education, health, social protection and job opportunities, while tackling climate change and environmental protection . Figure 1 . Sustainable Development Goals Health is directly connected to many of the SDGs, most importantly SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages . That is why the World Health Organization (WHO) has made the SDGs the focus of its new and future projects to support efforts towards universal health coverage, including the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All (SDG 3 Global Action Plan) . I.II Universal health coverage Universal health coverage means that all people and communities can use the promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative health services they need, of sufcient quality to be effective, while also ensuring that the use of these services does not expose the user to nancial hardship . In 2019, WHO set out its new ve-year strategic plan in the Thirteenth General Programme of Work 2019-2023, which includes the \"triple billion\" goal - ensuring that 1 billion more people benet from access to universal health coverage, 1 billion more people are better protected from health emergencies, and 1 billion more people enjoy better health and well-being (Figure 2) (1, 2) . Reaching this goal will require addressing the threats to health from a variety of angles . I. Background2 WHO list of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetesFigure 2 . The triple billion goal of the WHO Thirteenth General Programme of Work Importantly, universal health coverage, the rst of the three goals, depends in large part on access to essential medicines, vaccines and health products, including medical devices, as well as the quality of the health workforce, health facilities and information (Figure 3) (3). Figure 3 . The dimensions of universal health coverage This publication is the outcome of a project developed by WHO in response to the need for a model reference list of basic and priority medical devices required for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) based on the Global Status Report on noncommunicable diseases 2014 (4), with the goal of increasing access to these medical devices, especially in low- and middle-income countries to complement the Priority Medical devices for Cancer management (2017) .

Background I.III WHO Global NCD Action Plan NCDs - including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes - are the world's biggest killers . More than 40 million people die annually from NCDs (74% of global deaths), including more than 15 million people who die too young between the ages of 30 and 70 . Low- and middle-income countries already bear 85% of the burden of these premature deaths . (5). Most of these premature deaths from NCDs are largely preventable by enabling health systems to respond more effectively and equitably to the health care needs of people with NCDs and influencing public policies in sectors outside health that tackle shared risk factors, including tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and the harmful use of alcohol . To strengthen national efforts to address the burden of NCDs, the World Health Assembly endorsed the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013-2020 in May 2013 (5). The Global NCD Action Plan provides Member States, international partners and WHO with a roadmap and menu of policy options that, when implemented collectively between 2013 and 2020, would contribute to progress on nine global NCD targets to be attained in 2025 . One of these nine targets specically address the issue of access to medical technologies and aims at an increase up to \"an 80% availability of the affordable basic technologies and essential medicines, including generics, required to treat major noncommunicable diseases in both public and private facilities\" (Figure 4) (6).

VOLUNTA RY GLOBA L T ARGETS FOR PREVENTION AND CONT ROL OF N O N C O M M UNICAB LE DISEASES TO BE ATTAINED B Y 2025 Source: (34).4 WHO list of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes Cardiovascular diseases: global situation Cardiovascular diseases are a group of diseases of the heart muscle, valves, conduction system and blood vessels, which manifest primarily as heart attacks and strokes (about 80% of all deaths form cardiovascular disease) (7). Of less prevalence but major importance are heart failure, valvular disease and arrhythmia . Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of disability and premature death throughout the world, taking the lives of 17 .9 million people in 2019, of which 81% occur in developing countries and over one third are premature deaths (Figure 5) (8). The underlying pathology is atherosclerosis, a build-up of fatty deposits on the inner walls of the blood vessels, which reduces blood flow to the heart muscle through an acutely obstructive process or over many years . It is usually advanced by the time symptoms occur . Acute coronary events (heart attacks) and cerebrovascular events (strokes) frequently occur suddenly and are often fatal before medical care can be given (9). Figure 5 . Age-standardized cardiovascular disease mortality rates (per 100 000 population) for both sexes by country, 2019 Source: Global Health Estimates situation Stroke was the second leading cause of death in 2019, with 6 .2 million lives lost globally . It has occupied a high spot on the list of the leading causes of death worldwide for the past 20 years (10) . Stroke also causes signicant morbidity and is the second-leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years (11). Early recognition of the symptoms of a stroke and access to medical care are crucial to saving patients' lives and improving outcomes (12). Rehabilitation is often necessary to address residual functional decits following a stroke to achieve and maintain optimal levels of functioning . A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted . There are two types of stroke . Ischaemic strokes are caused by a blockage in an artery, usually created by a clot; haemorrhagic strokes occur when a blood vessel bursts . The symptoms of stroke vary depending on the area of the brain that is affected . Often the symptoms occur on one side of the body and result in weakness and loss of sensation . Other signs may include severe headache, confusion or difculty speaking . The symptoms can range from mild to severe or even result in sudden death (13). Diagnostic testing to distinguish the type of stroke that the patient is experiencing is a key factor in saving lives and improving post-stroke quality of life . Strokes are on the rise in low- and middle-income countries, with rates more than doubling over the past 40 years (14). Mortality attributed to stroke by country is depicted in Figure 6 . Differences between sexes in stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, and outcomes have been documented worldwide . Although men are at higher risk of stroke for most age groups, women older than 85 are at higher risk . In addition, women have worse post- stroke recovery than men . (15). Effective stroke prevention involves management of hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol in addition to lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation, increased exercise and a healthy diet . Treatment and rehabilitation relies on the availability of medical devices used to diagnose the condition promptly, technologies to aid health care providers in the delivery of care, and staff that are trained to use these tools appropriately . Low- and middle-income countries are disadvantaged in their level of access to such resources (16). Figure 6 . Age-standardized stroke mortality rates (per 100 000 population) for both sexes by country, 2019 Source: Global Health Estimates of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetesDiabetes: global situation Approximately 422 million adults had diabetese in 2014 . (18). A study in 2013 suggests that almost half of all diabetes cases in adults were undiagnosed . (19). Diabetes has detrimental effects throughout the body and the impacts accumulate over time (20). If diabetes is not effectively managed, debilitating and life- threatening complications can arise . Diabetes was the ninth most common cause of death worldwide in 2019 (10). Of the 1 .5 million deaths due to diabetes, 48% occur before the age of 70 years (20). Low- and middle-income countries experience higher premature mortality from diabetes due to reduced access to the resources necessary to successfully identify and manage the disease (21). Unfortunately, these are the same areas where diabetes rates are increasing the most rapidly (Figure 7) . The global distribution of Diabetes mellitus mortality is depicted in Figure 8 . The prevalence of diabetes has nearly quadrupled over the past three decades . This is partly due to an ageing population (as age is a risk factor), but in large part also due to the increasing prevalence of preventable risk factors, such as obesity and physical inactivity . In 2015, low- and middle-income countries lost an estimated US$ 507 billion to diabetes costs (20) , and had signicantly higher mortality rates than high-income countries (22) . Figure 7 . Age-adjusted trends in prevalence of diabetes, 1980-2014, by World Bank country income group Source: WHO Global report on diabetes (20) . Diabetes impairs the body's ability to convert food or caloric beverages into energy . It is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia, with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism . Poorly managed diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, infection, kidney failure, vision loss, depression and dementia . A combination of commonly occurring peripheral nerve damage and arterial disease is the pathway to non-healing foot ulcers, often leading to infection and limb amputation (23). Two common types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes, which requires insulin for survival, and type 2 diabetes, which develops over time as the resistance to insulin within the cells increases and insulin production decreases (20). There is no preventive intervention for type 1 diabetes, but the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes to complications can be slowed or even halted through lifestyle modication and adherence to proper health care interventions . Approximately 95% of diabetes cases are type 2 diabetes (23). Rehabilitation becomes important to those who experience complications related to diabetes . In people following amputation, rehabilitation helps to achieve the best possible level of functioning and independence .26 GLOBA L BURDEN OF DIABETES1. Unless otherwise noted, prevalence estimates reported in this section are age-standardized.In the past 3 decades the prevalence 1 ( a g e - s t a n d a r d i z e d ) of diabetes has risen substantially in countries at all income levels, mirroring the global increase in the number of people who are overweight or obese. The global prevalence of diabetes has grown from 4.7% in 1980 to 8.5% in 2014, during which time prevalence has increased or at best remained unchanged in every country (4). Over the past decade, diabetes prevalence has risen faster in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries (see Figure 4a). The WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region has experienced the greatest rise in diabetes prevalence, and is now the WHO region with the highest prevalence (13.7%) (see/uni00A0Figure/uni00A04b).TYPE 1 DIABETES Distinguishing between type 1 and type 2 diabetes is not always easy as it often requires relatively sophisticated laboratory tests for pancreas function. Distinct global estimates of diabetes prevalence for type 1 and type 2 therefore do not exist. Much of our knowledge of the incidence of type 1 diabetes relates to children and has been generated by collaborative initiatives to develop population- based, standardized registries of new cases worldwide, such as the WHO DIAMOND Project (5). Globally, these registries recorded large differences in the incidence and prevalence of type 1 diabetes, ranging from over 60 to under 0.5/uni00A0 cases annually per 100 000 children aged under 15 years; differences in case ascertainment FIGURE 4A.

Background Lack of resources is a common barrier to early diagnosis and effective management of diabetes . No data exist to reflect the extent of the problem across all levels of health care delivery . However, in low-income countries, less than half of all primary health care facilities have basic supplies for glucose measurement . Primary health care facilities in low-, middle-, and upper middle-income countries struggle to screen for serious complications that are common in diabetes, because less than 50% have the necessary equipment . While is it likely that tests and devices for monitoring diabetes and diagnosing and treating its complications are available in a few specialized institutions, it is important to make some of them more widely available . Countries hoping to reduce health care expenditure will need to invest both in procuring evidence-based medical devices and in training the health care workforce to use them safely and effectively (21). Figure 8 . Age-standardized Diabetes mellitus mortality rates (per 100 000 population) for both sexes by country, 2019 Source: Global Health Estimates of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetesI.IV Availability of and access to medical devices for NCDs Medical devices are indispensable for effective diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and rehabilitation of illness and disease . An estimated 1 .5 million different medical devices exist, in more than 20 000 types of generic device groups (24, 25) . Assistive devices are essential to ensure functioning, independence, and well-being of individuals living with stroke, diabetes, and other chronic conditions . In 2008, WHO initiated the rst global effort to identify global needs for medical devices, with the aim of prioritizing and selecting the essential and affordable medical devices of greatest importance, taking into account the disease burden of individual countries . In 2010, a rst global survey on medical devices revealed major gaps in the availability of and access to medical devices in countries (26), as well as vast discrepancies between countries regarding the existence of regulatory capacities, national policies, national lists, and technical specications for procurement and reimbursement of medical devices . The update of these data was presented in the WHO Global atlas of medical devices 2010 (28). Examples of global availability of high-cost medical devices per 1 million population are available in the Global atlas of medical devices (28). WHO estimates that 1 billion people need assistive devices globally, but only 1 in 10 people has access to the devices they need (27). WHO published the Priority Assistive Products List with the goal to improve the availability and affordability of assistive devices in countries . Many basic technologies for the early detection, diagnosis and monitoring of NCDs were reported as being generally available in primary care facilities in the public health sector: 98% for blood pressure measurement, 92% for height and weight measurement, and 88% for blood glucose measurement (29) . Urine strips for albumin assay, and total cholesterol measurement were also reported as being generally available (69%) in most countries . However, for the remainder of the basic technologies, fewer than half of countries reported them as being generally available: for example, HbA1c (53% of countries) and remaining tests (such as dilated fundus examination, foot vibration perception by tuning fork and peak flow measurement spirometry were reported as being generally available in 45-50% of countries . The six essential technologies for the early detection, diagnosis and monitoring of NCDs comprise devices for measurement of height, weight, blood glucose, blood pressure, and total cholesterol, and urine strips for albumin assay . The general availability of the six essential basic technologies is shown in Figure 9 by WHO region and World Bank income group (height and weight are combined) . Total cholesterol measurement was highly variable across regions and income groups with signicantly lower availability reported in the South- East Asia (45% of countries) and African regions (32% of countries), and countries of the low income (26%) and low-middle-income (37%) groups . By contrast, blood pressure measurement was consistently available in 90% or more of countries across all regions and income groups . Just over half of countries (53%) reported all six essential tests and procedures (measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, blood glucose, and total cholesterol, as well as urine strips for albumin assay) being generally available . Marked disparities were evident across the income groups: 96% of high-income countries reported all six tests and procedures were generally available compared with 16% (or just ve) low-income countries . Figure 10 shows the percentage of countries with procedures generally available for treating NCDs in the public health care system, by World Bank income group . Disparities across income groups are marked: all but 10 high-income countries reported six or seven of the seven procedures as being generally available, while 55% of low-income countries reported no procedures as being generally available, and a further third reported just one .9I.

The process involves a review of clinical guidelines to dene interventions and identication of medical devices required to perform each intervention by level of care . However, there were very few WHO guidelines available for the management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes; the methodology therefore had to be modied accordingly . The following overview presents the milestones and the adaptation of the methodology throughout the process that led to the present publication . Figure 12 . Methodology: from disease identication to dissemination of information 2017 The rst draft selection of medical devices for cardiovascular diseases, including different clinical services, took place . This project was done in parallel with work carried out by the WHO PAHO, following the methodology and structure of the priority medical devices for cancer management (30). 2018 In a meeting to review the progress made in developing the list of priority medical devices for cardiovascular interventions, it was conrmed that many devices used for the management of cardiovascular diseases and their complications are also used in the management of stroke and diabetes complications . As a result, it was decided that the priority interventions and according medical devices for all three diseases were to be combined in a single publication using ad hoc methodology . In the next step, medical conditions arising from cardiovascular diseases and diabetes were identied using WHO publications and available evidence based clinical guidelines . The selected types of conditions were matched with the WHO International Classication of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD -11) (32), while the clinical interventions were matched with the WHO International Classication of Health Interventions (ICHI) codes . The types of conditions included the following (colour coded by category - see introductory section) .Disease areasClinical guidelinesPriority clinical interventions Final list of priority medical devices DisseminationPublication Cardiovascular Stroke Diabetes Types of conditionsSearch and selection according to the NEATS Instrument ICD-11 .test.evidenceprime .comII.

This rst draft was presented in a workshop and session at the fourth WHO Global Forum on Medical Devices in India, December 2018 (33). 2019 Step 1. Selection of evidence based clinical guidelines for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes was performed by Cochrane Netherlands (see Annex 2) . Step 2. A multidisciplinary group of experts in cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and medical devices was assembled to review the draft list of clinical interventions and priority medical devices . Each clinical intervention was grouped based on the level of care: primary, secondary or tertiary level . Step 3. Systematic reviews of selected international guidelines were performed to identify clinical interventions . The selected clinical interventions were classied into different units of health care services: 1 . clinical assessment, 2 . emergency care, 3 . clinical laboratories, 4 . other specialized diagnostic services, 5 . medical imaging, 6 . surgery, 7 . non-surgical interventions, 8 . hospitalization, 9 . intensive care unit, 10 . rehabilitation, 11. palliative care . Step 4. The list of clinical interventions was validated using evidence based clinical guidelines as a reference standard . Step 5. A group of interdisciplinary experts was selected and invited to attend a consultation meeting on 11 and 12 July 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland . Depending on the individual expertise, participants joined one of the three working groups formed to discuss topics relevant to cardiovascular diseases or diabetes . After the two days of discussions, the following meeting outcomes were achieved . The project timeline was reviewed and approved . The methodology for selection of evidence based clinical guideliness to support the identication of priority medical devices was presented and approved . Experts identied and agreed on a draft list of priority clinical interventions for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes . Experts identied and agreed on a draft list of priority medical devices for cardiac and vascular diseases and diabetes . Next steps and country implementation strategies were discussed in the context of different health care settings .14 WHO list of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetesStep 6. A draft document including background, methodology, and lists of clinical interventions and priority medical devices was developed and reviewed by an extended group of experts . Medical devices were grouped as either general or specic, depending on their applicability to more than one disease . 2020 Step 1. Global on-line consultations took place on the list of priority medical devices for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes . Step 2. Expert group teleconferences were organized to review comments and nalize the list of priority medical devices . Step 3. Technical editing and design were completed . Step 4. Digital publication was completed . II.I Search and selection of clinical guidelines Due to the lack of clinical guidelines developed by WHO for the management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, WHO commissioned Cochrane Netherlands to identify and select good-quality clinical guidelines addressing the diseases within the scope of this project . A broad search was performed to identify English language clinical guidelines on prevention, diagnosis, treatment or rehabilitation for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes published between 2017 and 2019 . Guidelines from international organizations as well as guidelines developed at national level, including in low- and middle-income countries, were of interest . The following guideline resources were searched to identify guidelines from North America, Europe, Australia, Canada, and low- and middle-income countries: Emergency Care Research Institute Guidelines Trust Turning Research into Practice database Global Health Library Guidelines International Network: International Guidelines Library Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health reports National Institute for Health and Care Excellence evidence search World Heart Federation International Diabetes Federation World Stroke Organization . A two-step search approach was taken . The information specialist of Cochrane Netherlands performed an initial search using general terms for the conditions of interest (cardiovascular and diabetes) and selected guidelines based on relevance to the topics . Search terms used are reported in Annex 2 . The preselected clinical guidelines were assessed according to the following aspects: whether the guideline contained details regarding interventions or medical devices for specic categories of disease; whether the guideline addressed prevention, diagnosis, treatment or rehabilitation; items of the National Guideline Clearinghouse Extent of Adherence to Trustworthy Standards (NEATS) instrument (Annex 3) . Based on these assessments, the most recent and highest-quality clinical guideline addressing a specic category of disease was selected . For specic categories of disease that were not covered by one of the selected guidelines, an additional search was performed using terms and synonyms for that specic category of disease . The identied clinical guidelines were assessed as described above .15II. Methodology II.II Selected clinical guidelines Cardiovascular diseases (except stroke) Seventeen guidelines were assessed after the initial searches (Table 1) . Additional searches were performed for the disease categories of \"coronary atherosclerosis\" and \"arterial disease\", which led to the assessment of three additional guidelines . Of the 20 guidelines assessed, 14 were selected based on an average score of 3 points or higher on the NEATS items (Annex 3) . Table 1 .

The development and incorporation of these technologies have enabled effective access to quality care and improved capacity to screen, diagnose, treat, rehabilitate and palliate diseases . However, deaths occur as a result of lack of accessible, affordable and available technologies, as well as specialized human resources . The Priority Medical Devices project, convened by WHO, has the purpose of improving global access to medical devices . The project aims to produce a list of priority medical devices needed for the management of high-burden diseases at a given health care level and in a given context (38). Priority medical devices are health products that respond to priority health interventions . These medical devices need to be safe, of good quality, effective, appropriate, affordable, accessible and acceptable . They need to be available to respond to the priority health needs of the setting and should be used safely by the health care worker or nal user . The devices listed in this publication are presented using only generic names (trademarks or commercial names were not included) . Medical devices that are manufactured, selected, purchased or used need to be assessed and evaluated locally by authorities to respond to local regulatory requirements, and selected to be affordable by the health care system . Moreover, the users must be trained for appropriate and safe use of specic medical devices, whenever this applies . In addition, medical devices must be used by the appropriate user, as most of them are developed for use by health professionals, but others are intended for use directly by the patient . Depending on the user, special training or familiarization with the medical device is needed . This also affects directly the level of care at which some interventions can be performed, depending on the level of specialization of the staff. Priority medical devices are options that further need to be assessed considering the diverging needs of countries of differing income levels or other contexts, including appropriate infrastructure, design factors, and specialized human resources .28 WHO list of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetesLevels of health care In this document, three different levels are considered . These three levels of health care are referred in the tables of priority medical devices as \"level of care\" 1, 2 and 3 . They are dened as follows . Primary health care (level of care 1). This includes (a) essential health care made accessible at a cost that a country and community can afford, with methods that are practical, scientically sound and socially acceptable; and (b) the rst level of contact with people acting to improve health in a community, including through health promotion, disease prevention, screening, rehabilitation, provision of assistive devices and palliative care (39). This level includes self-testing, self-treatment and personal care; and health posts, health centres or equivalent health care facilities that have outpatient care . Secondary health care (level of care 2). This includes ambulatory medical services and commonplace general hospital care (outpatient and inpatient services) . Access is often via referral from primary health care services . This level generally includes the following medical specialties: general or family medicine, internal medicine, paediatrics, gynaeco-obstetrics and general surgery (39). Tertiary health care (level of care 3). This refers to specialized medical and related services of high complexity and usually high cost technologies that require a specialized health care workforce . These services are used by those referred from secondary care for diagnosis and treatment not available in primary or secondary care. Tertiary care is generally only available at specialized, regional or national health care facilities with both inpatient and outpatient referral centres (39). Types of medical devices, according to use Tables will divide the list of priority medical devices in each unit by general or specic use for a disease: general medical devices for basic use of the clinical unit to perform a majority of interventions for a big scope of diseases . Range of specication may vary depending on the level of healh . specic medical devices aimed for diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation interventions of a specic type of disease . Range of specication may vary depending on the level of health and specialization of the condition . kits or sets, group of instruments, single-use devices and consumables used together for a particular medical purpose . They are intemised at the end of the intervention table in which they were rst mentioned (or see Annex 5 for a compilation of all kits and sets) . 1.

Clinical Assessment Most premature deaths related to NCDs can be avoided through a combination of early detection and preventive interventions . The clinical interventions listed in this chapter include simple, affordable tools for early detection, treatment and risk assessment (Table 10) . The aim is to prevent cardiovascular diseases and diabetes by ensuring equitable access to continuous, standardized, high-quality care for people at high risk . Table 10 .

Emergency care Emergency care is an essential part of an effective health system, ensuring timely access to care for all patients . Well organized emergency care provides timely recognition, resuscitation and referral for severely ill patients, and denitive care for many others . In many settings, especially where resources are limited, emergency care is the rst point of contact with the health system . The WHO Emergency Care System Framework denes a series of essential functions for an emergency care system, ranging from pre-hospital care, to care during transport, to facility-based emergency unit care and inpatient operative and critical care as needed . Each of the functions described in the WHO Emergency Care System Framework can be achieved in many ways, depending on available resources, and each is essential to the delivery of effective emergency care . Emergency care systems address cardiovascular emergencies such as heart attack and stroke, as well as metabolic emergencies such as acute complications of diabetes . Emergency care represents a cross-cutting investment that delivers benets across other NCDs, injuries, complications of pregnancy and communicable diseases . It is estimated that over half of deaths in low- and middle-income countries are from conditions that can be addressed by emergency care (40) . The WHO Essential Resources for Emergency Care describes essential minimum equipment for ambulances and emergency units at various levels of the health system . Acute cardiovascular diseases, diabetes or stroke may present with difculty breathing, shock or altered mental status . Tables 15 and 16 describe emergency medical devices generally used in such situations . Clinical guidance for front-line emergency providers on assessment and treatment of acute presentations, such as difculty breathing, shock, trauma and altered mental status, can be found in the WHO Basic Emergency Care course (41). 2.1 General priority medical devices for emergency care Medical devices used for emergency care are divided into two categories: Basic (B): paramedics, nurse stations, ambulances, stretcher and others, related to level 2 of health care provision . Advanced (A): emergency units in clinics or hospitals, specialized ambulances, related to level 3 of health care services . 38 WHO list of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetesTable 15 .

Clinical laboratory Clinical laboratory testing plays an essential role in the delivery of health care . The purpose of a laboratory for clinical diagnostics is to perform accurate testing on patient samples and to analyse and interpret the results, thereby guiding the diagnosis, treatment, management and monitoring of the patient . The process for a laboratory diagnostic test comprises the correct identication of the patient, the right test selection in order to collect the sample of blood or other biological matter from the patient by the nurse, doctor or phlebotomy technician, and then transfer the sample to the clinical laboratory where the required tests will be performed by trained laboratory personnel . (42). Some tests are performed manually, and others are done using automated or semi-automated instrumentation . Therefore, it is crucial that skilled or specially trained human resources (biomedical laboratory scientists) are available to perform the required tests and provide clinical advice where needed . The laboratory provides a report of the test results to the referring clinician, who will then interpret them and decide on the diagnosis and treatment of the patient . Timeliness, accuracy of results, good-quality management and universal safety are critical elements in the safe functioning of the clinical laboratory . Quality control tests and external quality assessment schemes should be carried out regularly as part of laboratory quality assurance (43). The personnel required depends on the anticipated volume of samples and processes to be handled by the specic laboratory unit . Depending on the national context and factors, including workforce availability, different occupations can full the roles that may be required for clinical laboratory testing and pathology . Prerequisites for that include having the required competencies to perform those roles, and ofcial recognition in accordance with the scope of practice . Selection of the equipment for laboratory services depends mainly upon volume and available resources . The type of equipment selected (for example, automated or semi-automated) should take into account the facility capacity and the options for purchasing, leasing or renting the equipment and devices, along with the relevant consumables, accessories and software . Detailed recommendations for the type of infrastructure required for a clinical laboratory can be found in ISO 15189:2012 Medical laboratories - requirements for quality and competence, and the WHO list of priority medical devices for cancer management, Chapter 4: Clinical laboratory & pathology (pages 91-96), including the following procedures of interest: pre-analytical procedure: phlebotomy, sample reception and distribution, page 91 general analytical procedures, pages 92-96 . The diagnosis tests listed in this chapter are those belonging to the clinical laboratory setting (Table 17). Tables 18-22 then present general medical devices that can be used for diagnosis of many diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and specic medical devices that are used for disease- specic interventions . The interventions and tests listed in the tables are, aligned with the WHO model list of essential in vitro diagnostics (34) . 44 WHO list of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetesTable 17 .

Medical imaging Medical imaging encompasses different imaging modalities and processes to image the human body for diagnostic and treatment purposes and therefore plays an important role in initiatives to improve public health for all population groups . The complexity of infrastructure, equipment and human resources for medical imaging services should be consistent with the capabilities of the health care level in which they are placed (primary, secondary or tertiary) . Medical imaging devices have very specic infrastructure requirements related to safety and the physical resources they need to function properly, for example, building requirements for radiation protection and magnetic safety, three-phase electric power supplies, and correct viewing conditions . Detailed recommendations on the type of infrastructure required for a medical imaging unit can be found in the WHO list of priority medical devices for cancer management . The use of the following devices in coordination with dened, evidence-based, clinical procedures and protocols is important to achieve the best patient outcomes and to use equipment efciently and effectively . Existing imaging referral guidelines can be used to enhance appropriateness of referral . The minimum technical equipment required to respond to the clinical needs are described in the tables, but detailed technical specications should be developed according to local needs . Compliance with the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard is required when developing a functional network of medical imaging devices, along with visualization devices and printers as needed . Digital information can be used in teleradiology applications, and this should be clear in the specication for the particular service or unit . It is important to note that besides the capital expenses of the building, room infrastructure and equipment, the expense of DICOM and other information technology (IT) licences, plus the expected cost of maintaining and updating the licence, should be considered when setting up a medical imaging unit . A coordinated team of health care professionals (for example, radiographers, radiologists, nuclear medicine specialists, ultrasonographers and technologists) is essential to the process of producing and interpreting diagnostic images . Medical physicists have an important role in the optimization of the studies and in the development of quality assurance, dosimetry and radiation protection programmes that ensure safe and effective medical imaging . Additionally, biomedical engineers are needed for the technical management of equipment, and IT specialists are needed to establish and maintain teleradiology systems . Guidance on education and training in radiation protection of health professionals is available elsewhere (44-46) . Depending on national context, including workforce availability and models, different occupations can full the roles that may be required for medical imaging . Prerequisites for that include having the required competencies to perform those roles, and ofcial recognition in accordance with the scope of practice . Detailed recommendations for the type of infrastructure required for a medical imaging unit can be found in the WHO list of priority medical devices for cancer management . Because of the detailed specications of each item of imaging equipment, this chapter is structured differently from the rest . After listing the medical imaging procedures (Table 27), the following tables (Tables 28-35) give a thorough description of the main imaging capital equipment, such as X-rays, ultrasound scans, computer tomography scans and magnetic resonance images . Tables 36-38 then list specic imaging interventions for each disease, and the extra equipment or consumables needed for that purpose .58 WHO list of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetesTable 27 .

Surgery The objective of a surgical unit is to provide general and specialized surgical care for patients . A central goal of surgical care is interventional curative treatment . While surgical procedures are intended to save lives and prevent disability, unsafe procedures or lack of adequately skilled personnel can cause substantial harm . In 2015, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery found that 5 billion people do not have access to safe surgery . The issue was recognized by all Member States in World Health Assembly resolution WHA68 .15, on strengthening emergency and essential surgical care and anaesthesia as a component of universal health coverage (47). Services provided by a surgical unit must be safe, of high quality, and founded on guidelines or established standards, as highlighted by the second WHO Global Patient Safety Challenge, Safe Surgery Saves Lives (48) . Like other hospital units, surgery must be viewed as a part of the larger health system, recognizing that a surgery unit consists of broad human resource expertise, is linked to other critical health services, and contributes to wide-ranging service delivery across health disciplines . The surgery unit extends beyond the operating room and is also linked to pre- and post-operative services involving anaesthesia, pain management and nursing services . Post-operative nursing care, for example, must be effective in identifying post- operative complications and recognizing changes or deterioration in patient status, escalating levels of care appropriately . At its most basic, a surgical unit needs appropriately trained surgical health care professionals, sufcient physical infrastructure to ensure safe surgery, surgical supplies, and procedures that ensure safety and quality for both patients and staff . Detailed recommendations for the type of infrastructure required for a surgical unit can be found in the WHO list of priority medical devices for cancer management . The clinical interventions listed in this chapter are those performed in surgery settings (Table 39) . The following tables (Tables 40-43) present general medical devices that can be used for treatment of many diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and specic medical devices that are used for disease-specic interventions .

These capital medical devices are described in the table on generic equipment in Annex 4 . 6.2 Specic priority medical devices for surgical interventions, by disease 6.2.1 Cardiovascular diseases The purpose of cardiovascular surgery is to prevent, diagnose, treat, or monitor palliative cardiovascular disease . Cardiovascular surgery may be open or minimally invasive, and may involve electrophysiology, endoscopy, laparoscopy, and interventional radiology . Cardiovascular surgery covers multiple procedures ranging from anatomical restructuring - such as coronary angioplasty or grafting to unblock blood vessels - to implantation of mechanical products for cardiac resynchronization, for example . Percutaneous interventions for the coronary and the peripheral vascular system are catheter-based procedures often used to open partially or fully blocked blood vessels in people with cardiovascular disease . These procedures are done by a broad spectrum of specialists highly experienced at performing many traditionally invasive complex procedures, including interventional cardiology, electrophysiology, cardiovascular surgery, interventional radiology, and vascular surgery . Cardiovascular surgeons are clinical specialists aided by teams composed of nurses, interventional radiologists, radiographers and radiological technologists, and surgical technologists . While some cardiovascular surgery can be performed in a general operating theatre, high-risk procedures must be conducted in a cardiac catheterization laboratory (cath lab) . A cath lab is a room with a collection of medical devices that are used together during specic cardiovascular interventions . 82 WHO list of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetesTable 41 .

Non-surgical interventions Once a patient is diagnosed, doctors will prescribe an appropriate treatment . In many cases, that treatment will include medications, surgical interventions, or non-surgical interventions, or a combination of the three . Non-surgical interventions are those that are not necessarily performed under a surgical unit; some can even be done at home . Table 44 presents some priority non-surgical interventions for stroke and diabetes . The following tables (45 and 46) list the medical devices needed for such interventions .

Hospitalization A patient can be admitted into a hospital for multiple reasons, including scheduled tests, procedures, or surgery; emergency medical treatment; administration of medication; or to stabilize or monitor an existing condition (49). The inpatient unit is essential and is the most interconnected to all the other hospital units, as it provides a continuum of medical or nursing care plus other hospital services . When admitted, a patient should have a bed assigned either in a private or in a common room with all the required medical equipment and care (including medicines, rehabilitation, treatment and diet), depending on each patient's needs . A hospitalization unit should have a nurse station that can store all the patient's information and needed instrumentation . There should be at least a 1:8 nurse-to-patient ratio . In most high-income countries, hospitals manage to cover the needs of the inpatient unit . However, around the world, most hospitals are saturated, patients will not always have access to a personal bed, nurses and physicians are overwhelmed, the rehabilitation workforce is not available, and not all the needed medicines, medical and rehabilitation equipment are available . Patient safety is a serious global public health concern; estimates show that one in every 10 patients is harmed while receiving medical care (50) . The table 47 lists priority interventions taking place under a hospitalization setting for the three diseases .

Intensive care unit An intensive care unit (ICU) aims to support patients who are at immediate risk of undergoing or developing vital organ failure . It can be understood as a hospitalization unit that includes intensive and specialized medical and nursing care . ICUs offer medical staff who are specialized in caring for critically ill patients . ICUs have the capacity to sustain physiological organ support and are equipped with advanced patient physiological monitors . They are found in high-income countries but are becoming an important part of health structures in low- and middle-income countries as well . The rooms of ICU units should be large enough to deal with emergencies, and it should be possible to easily move beds and equipment (for example, resuscitation trolleys, oxygen devices or imaging modalities) . Subsequently, doors should be wide enough to avoid blockages and the whole unit should benet from proper ventilation, cooling and heating . Moreover, ICUs need to be connected to oxygen, pressurized air and vacuum outlets, and a proper electricity supply, and need to be secured with a continuous emergency power supply system . Spacious working areas, ofces for medical staff, and staff rest areas are highly recommended to increase the efciency of the department . The extent, as well as the capacity, of ICUs in hospitals can differ according to the level of specialization . Moreover, some hospitals feature an ICU to deal with specic types of patients or medical requirements . The ICU specialized in dealing with cardiovascular diseases, for example, can be termed a coronary care unit (CCU) . CCUs are specically designed and equipped to deal with life-threatening cardiovascular conditions . Most patients will be transferred to a ward when intensive care is no longer needed . Some hospitals feature a stroke unit or a neurology intensive unit, which is entirely devoted to care for patients with stroke and its complications . Stroke units and neurology intensive units are staffed with highly trained medical personnel, educated in specialized stroke care . The clinical interventions listed in this chapter are those applicable to the ICU (Table 52) . The extent of possible interventions depends on the level and degree of specialization of the ICU (for example, whether a CCU or stroke unit is present) . 102 WHO list of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetesTable 52 .

Rehabilitation Rehabilitation is the set of interventions needed when a person is experiencing or is likely to experience limitations in everyday functioning due to aging or a health condition, including chronic diseases or disorders, injuries, or traumas . It is an essential component of universal health coverage along with promotion, prevention, treatment, and palliative care, and it can help to prevent complications associated with many health conditions, such as spinal cord injury, stroke, or a fracture . Rehabilitation can also help to minimize or slow down the disabling effects of chronic health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes, by equipping people with self-management strategies and the assistive products they require, or by addressing pain or other complications . There is a broad range of health professionals who provide rehabilitation interventions, including physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, orthotic and prosthetic technicians, and physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians (51) . The type of rehabilitation varies depending on the disease or health complication of each patient . There is a wide range of innovations and medical devices that can assist a person's recovery and resumption of everyday life . Therefore, in this chapter medical devices will not be specied by disease but will be considered more generally, with usage to be determined by a health professional . Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes rehabilitation is achieved through medically supervised programs that involve adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle to address risk factors (52), for example through: exercise counseling and training education for heart-healthy living counseling to reduce stress . As mentioned above, because rehabilitation interventions are meant to help minimize or slow down the disabling effects of chronic health conditions, they are not separated by disease but by the rehabilitation domain . The following tables (Tables 57-68) describe the assistive products, equipment, service delivery platforms, and health workers needed for each intervention and domain . Service delivery platforms For each assessment or intervention, the DG members are asked to conrm the pre-selected service delivery platforms at which the assessment or intervention should be available . Assessments and interventions can be assigned to one or more service delivery platforms, depending on where they should be available . The service delivery platforms are described as follows: Rehabilitation at First Level Clinical (outpatient health clinics in the community) First level clinics include the rst access point for patients with acute health problems or the continuous delivery of discrete services for patients with chronic conditions . The rehabilitation service is available at a single-professional practice (e .g. OT practice), or integrated in a general primary health clinic (e .g. GP practice or primary healthcare centers and clinics) . Interventions for rehabilitation are person-centered and are provided by trained rehabilitation workers or by other health workers either under the supervision of trained rehabilitation workers or trained in rehabilitation and who may follow rehabilitation protocols (level of care 1) . Rehabilitation at General Referral Clinical (inpatient general hospital, emergency unit) Patients are referred to a general clinic from a rst level clinic or admitted through emergency . The rehabilitation service is integrated in the emergency or acute care (e .g. cardiovascular unit in acute hospital) or general inpatient service . In such services, multi-professional teams composed of different health professions work together . Interventions for rehabilitation are person-centered and are provided by trained rehabilitation workers or by health workers under supervision of trained rehabilitation workers or trained in rehabilitation and who may follow rehabilitation protocols (level of care 2) . 110 WHO list of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetesRehabilitation at Specialized Referral Clinical (inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation centers/unit) Patients are referred to a specialized rehabilitation center, or unit from a rst level clinic or a general referral clinic . Such centers or units may be specialized for the care of people with specic health conditions with complex rehabilitation needs (e .g. spinal cord injury rehabilitation center) or provide rehabilitation for people with a range of health conditions in a dedicated rehabilitation centre . In such in- or outpatient centers, multi-disciplinary teams composed of different rehabilitation professions (PRM physician, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, prosthetist&orthotist, rehabilitation nurse, etc .) work together, these centers and programmes commonly have capacity for longer-stay and high intensity delivery of rehabilitation interventions . Interventions for rehabilitation are person-centered and provided by trained rehabilitation workers specialized for the care of people with specic health conditions or by health workers under supervision of trained rehabilitation workers or trained in rehabilitation and who may follow rehabilitation protocols (level of care 3) . The list of rehabilitation interventions and assistive products, equipment and consumables required for general rehabilitation are presented in tables 57 and 58 by level of care: 1st, 2nd or 3rd, as described above .11113.

Palliative care: provides relief from pain and other distressing symptoms; afrms life and regards dying as a normal process; intends neither to hasten nor to postpone death; integrates the psychological and spiritual aspects of patient care; offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death; offers a support system to help the family cope during the patient's illness and in their own bereavement; uses a team approach to address the needs of patients and their families, including bereavement counselling, if indicated; enhances quality of life, and may also positively influence the course of illness; is applicable early in the course of illness, in conjunction with other therapies that are intended to prolong life, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and includes those investigations needed to better understand and manage distressing clinical complications . In some countries, there is recognition of the difference between general palliative care and specialist palliative care . For example, in the United Kingdom, the National Council for Hospice and Specialist Palliative Care Services (54) differentiates between: general palliative care, which \"is provided by the usual professional carers of the patient and family with low to moderate complexity of palliative care need\"; and specialist palliative care services, which \"are provided for patients and their families with moderate to high complexity of palliative care need . They are dened in terms of their core service components, their functions and the composition of the multiprofessional teams that are required to deliver them .\" Terminology in palliative care is somewhat controversial and varies across and even within countries . Recommended denitions of common terms used in palliative care have been offered by the European Association for Palliative Care (55, 56) and other organizations . Within a hospital, inpatient specialist palliative care units (with dedicated beds) can be provided . Alternatively, a multidisciplinary specialist palliative care team may provide consultations throughout the hospital to patients who remain in their wards or rooms under the primary care of their treating physician . A hospice may mean a separate service involving a range of components, including an inpatient unit, home care, day care, outpatient clinics and bereavement support service . Detailed recommendations for the type of infrastructure required for palliative care can be found in the WHO list of priority medical devices for cancer management . 11.1 General priority medical devices for palliative care Tables 69 and 70 present general medical devices that can be used for the general palliative care needs of many diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and specic medical devices .128 WHO list of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetesTable 62 .

The palliative care unit should have access to an X-ray system, computed tomography system and echographer, and blood laboratory test equipment . The devices and furniture should be adapted for adults' and children's needs . Proper patient identication through ID tags or similar is recommended .130 WHO list of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetesGuidance documents WHO list of priority medical devices for cancer management (palliative care chapter) Needs assessment for policy and strategy development The lists presented in this document dene priority medical devices for clinical interventions extracted from guidelines addressing selected NCDs: cardiovascular diseases and diabetes . Although the lists are not exclusive, they can serve as guidance for countries seeking to develop or implement a management policy or strategy for medical devices specic to these diseases . It is important to note the interdependence of these technologies: best outcomes cannot be achieved by investing in only one set of technologies . Diagnostic methods must be combined with therapeutic capability to achieve meaningful impact . This chapter includes a general implementation strategy and additional considerations to reach pragmatic decisions . As mentioned, it is important for each country to dene an implementation plan that will consider their country-specic needs, epidemiological situation, availability of infrastructure, and related human resources and nances, as well as affordability to patients . The WHO model lists can be used by countries to develop or update their national medical devices list, to support universal health coverage, address emergencies and ensuring well being of population . Figure 13 illustrates the general process to adapt the WHO model list to the national situation, perform a needs assessment and dene the medical devices that would be added to the national list . This procedure can be done at regional or institutional level, as needed . The following section will describe the implementation steps required to increase access to the specic medical devices selected, to meet the population needs . Figure 13 .

Implementation strategy132 WHO list of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetesNeeds assessment and implementation plan 1. Perform a needs assessment of in-country resources for cardiovascular and diabetes management: a. First, consider the national health plan and any available NCD programme priorities, strategies or objectives: i. Review country data, epidemiology and registries . ii. Consider if indicators or evaluation criteria are already in place regarding resources, and specically medical devices . b. Dene the scope of the implementation plan: national, regional, only specialty hospital or all health facilities, including district hospitals, health centres and community health posts: i. It is important that all levels of care are included in the considerations of the implementation plan, from community health centres to specialized hospitals, even if only one or many hospitals are being equipped . ii. The network has to consider reference to higher levels of care, emergency services and outpatient specialized units . c. Review the lists, unit by unit, with local specialists, and compare to your inventory or availability of technologies to manage NCDs . Note the devices that are general and can serve other diseases . d. Compile information about resources available or not yet appropriate or sufcient on the following topics: i. Health facilities that could be used for cardiovascular diseases or diabetes diagnosis or treatment in the scope of the study and related referral services . ii. Medical devices available per clinical unit, particularly those specied in this document for: \u00bbmedical imaging \u00bbpalliative care and end-of-life care . iii. Specialized human resources, particularly those mentioned in this document: \u00bbcardiologists, endocrinologists, intensivists, neurologists, specialized nurses \u00bbbiomedical engineers, equipment technicians, biomedical laboratory scientists \u00bbmedical physicists \u00bbradiologists \u00bbradiographers . iv. National treatment guidelines, protocols or care pathways for cardiovascular diseases or diabetes . v. Priority interventions if dened by an insurance package linked to universal health coverage and reimbursement schemes . vi. Target population: \u00bbtypes of procedures for types of patients \u00bbpopulation distribution in the country \u00bbcatchment areas for diagnosis \u00bbsupport for patients' transportation to and stay in treatment centres . vii. Funding allocation \u00bbDepending on the country or setting, this funding could be pre-established or will have to be calculated depending on the technology required, followed by search for approval . \u00bbFunding to support the ongoing interventions for diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and palliative care is required . \u00bbConsider other sponsorships and allocation of funds to national cardiovascular diseases or diabetes programmes to support patients' access and affordability .133IV. Implementation strategy 2. Once the needs assessment is done and the gaps identied, select an appropriate methodology to prioritize and select which medical devices would be most needed, considering some of the following aspects: a. Target population . b. Type of intervention for ccardiovascular diseases or diabetes disease management . c. Equity, gender and ethical issues, if applicable . d. Equipment complementary to other diseases . e. Available budget for: i. Infrastructure, to install equipment (e .g. haemodialysis units, cardiac cath units, stroke units) . ii. Capital equipment and its life cycle operation, maintenance and consumables . iii. Procurement and supply of single-use medical devices . iv. Training of health care workers in safe and appropriate use . v. Other medical devices, for example in the areas of quality control and safety, complementary to the capital equipment . f. Feasibility and organizational challenges, such as where to place the technology - where more resources are available or where most of the target population is based . Most of these considerations are part of health technology assessment and health technology management studies, subject to a certicate of need . Most of them should be considered by a specially convened committee to make informed, evidence-based decisions . 3. If a technology is approved for incorporation into the health care system, the following must be considered and dened, usually within a process of health technology management handled by personnel with relevant technical expertise: a. Regulatory clearance: the regulatory approval process of the specic technology performed by the national regulatory agency - the ministry of health for medical devices, or the nuclear, radiological or similar body for other relevant devices . These entities need to be in continuous collaboration . b. Technical specications that are generic and comply with standards to guarantee the technical quality of the device . c. Bidding process: i. In the case of haemodialysis, nuclear medicine or other diagnostic and interventional imaging equipment, the mechanical guidelines of the infrastructure are to be considered . ii. Bids should include extended warranty, training for users, installation and spare parts . iii. Budget should include operating costs, including maintenance for the whole life cycle of technologies (around 10 years) . d. Government importation requirements . e. Transportation, insurance, taxes, customs, delivery and installation . f. Reception of the equipment, verication of installation, and training of the users and health care workers by the manufacturer . g. Supply chain of consumables . h. Verication of quality, safety and performance . i. Decommissioning and waste management procedures (58, 59) . WHO database of priority medical devices WHO has developed a database, clearing house to host all the medical devices listed in this publication and other related publications of selection of priority medical devices . \"MeDevIS\" is the priority medical devices information systems, webbased, that includes technical information and will be periodically updated . This can be a very helpful tool to search, review and select medical devices by intervention, by delivery platform or by publication .

It is envisioned that these lists of medical devices classied by clinical unit will assist policy-makers, health care managers and technical experts to dene the needs of each setting and to inform the development or update of the national medical devices lists approved for procurement or reimbursement, towards universal health coverage . Medical devices run the substantial risk of being unused due to technology misalignment with deployment settings (60). Contextually relevant interventions and devices must be selected to improve resource allocation in each country, depending on the local needs and resources available . Financing models are also an important consideration, and their ability to deliver services within health care systems should be carefully evaluated . The lists presented in this publication should be adapted by a local committee to different cultural norms and reviewed according to local epidemiology, national policies, regulatory frameworks, and the available specialized health care workforce, infrastructure, budget, and organizational structures . It is therefore important to consider innovation, regulatory approval of the technologies, and the health technology assessment process to enable informed decision-making, taking into consideration equity, social, clinical and economic aspects as well as health technology management aspects . Such informed decision- making will ensure that the procurement, installation, training and safe use of technologies is done in the most effective way, ensuring the well-being of the patient . The selection of the technologies required from the lists presented in this publication is just the rst step of many to provide best care for patients . These technologies require multidisciplinary expertise to be implemented . More information will be available from WHO and other agencies to support selection, procurement and best use of these medical devices for all patients and specically to target management of NCDs . Much work is still needed in order to increase access to the appropriate, good-quality medical technology required to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor NCDs worldwide, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and to develop the human resource competencies of specialized interventions and ensure nancial resources to provide the services under the universal health coverage initiative . The recent COVID-19 global situation calls for prioritizing investment in prevention and management of health . It has been noted that population with NCDs are more prone to have COVID-19 complications, therefore the prevention and management of NCDs is of paramount importance and thus, important to have access to the medical devices required for them .V Concluding remarks136 WHO list of priority medical devices for management of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes1.

For the items about transparency and Guideline Development Group (GDG) composition, there is a scale consisting of \"yes\", \"no\", or \"unknown\" . Good quality was dened as an average score of 3 points or higher (1 = Poor, 2 = Fair, 3 = Good, 4 = Very Good, and 5 = Excellent) combined with clear information on transparency and GDC composition . The Emergency Care Research Institute Guidelines Trust presents TRUST (Transparency and Rigour Using Standards of Trustworthiness) scorecards for guidelines . These TRUST scorecards consist of the items of the NEATS instrument . If a TRUST scorecard was available for a guideline, we used these item scores . Funding and potential conflicts of interest The Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) discloses and states explicitly its funding source . Financial conflicts of interest of GDG members have been disclosed and managed . Composition of the GDG The GDG includes persons from a variety of relevant clinical specialties and other professional groups . The guideline states that it included a methodological expert in the GDG, and it identies the methodologist . Systematic review of evidence The CPG or a related companion document describes a search strategy that includes a listing of databases searched; a summary of search terms used; and the specic time period covered by the literature search, including the beginning date (month and year) and end date (month and year) . The CPG or a related companion document describes the study selection; description includes the number of studies identied, the number of studies included, and a summary of inclusion and exclusion criteria . The CPG or a related companion document provides a synthesis of evidence from the selected studies; i.e., an analysis of individual studies and the body of evidence, in the form of a detailed description or evidence tables, or both . Foundations for recommendations The CPG provides a grading or rating of the level of condence in or certainty regarding the quality or strength of the evidence for each recommendation . The potential benets and harms of recommended care are clearly described .Annex 3. Shortened version of the NEATS instrument (built on the framework of the AGREE II tool)145Annex 4 . Explanations concerning equipment, consumables and single-use medical devices To synthesize the lists on each section, equipment, medical devices, consumables and disposable devices are not detailed in the tables . The listed capital equipment is considered complete and ready for operation when purchased . The accessories are the components external to the main unit (for example, cables, sensors, probes, trolley), and they are usually delivered with their corresponding capital equipment along with the internal software, batteries and battery chargers if needed (batteries may be rechargeable or alkaline) . Nearly all medical equipment must be able to function on a power grid as well as on a battery in the event of a failure of the public electrical grid, for the safety of the patient and to enable completion of the ongoing procedure . Some accessories or software can vary from child to adult, by age or by gender (for example, blood pressure cuffs and oximetry sensors) . It is advisable to have at least one of each, depending on the patients who will use the equipment in question .
