Aromatherapy and the use of essential oils have been introduced into hospital settings over the last few years to benefit patients, their relatives and hospital staff. A complementary approach A solution for some health professionals seeking to diversify their approach and complement treatments, clinical aromatherapy can be used in patient care. Surveys conducted by the [Gattefoss\u00e9 Foundation](http://www.gattefosse.com/en/therapeutic-applications-of-essential-oils-/mapping-clinical-trials-in-hospitals.html) revealed that a number of hospital establishments in Europe (Germany, Switzerland, Belgium) are using essential oils to complement conventional treatments. Alternative use remains an exception. In France, the inclusion of aromatherapy in hospital protocols is still at a very preliminary stage. Clinical aromatherapy: encouraging results... The use of essential oils in hospitals is often most prevalent in geriatric and oncology departments. Health professionals diffuse them or use them depending on the experience of hospital teams and always with written consent. The following benefits have been observed: - Improves patient quality of life - Mutually beneficial for patients and staff - Pleasant aroma in the hospital - Reduces anxiety and sleep deprivation in patients ...that are being studied with a view to future development This complementary approach merits a more in-depth study and trials by hospital teams. Aromatherapy is now included in clinical protocols supporting patient care.
