Dr Lo\u00efc Lannelongue, who is a research associate in biomedical data science and a postdoctoral associate at Jesus College, Cambridge, said: \"Science has transformed our understanding of the world around us and has led to great benefits to society. But this has come with a not-insignificant - and not always well understood - impact on the environment. As scientists - as with people working in every sector - it's important that we do what we can to reduce the carbon footprint of our work to ensure that the benefits of our discoveries are not outweighed by their environmental costs.\" Recent studies have begun to explore the environmental impacts of scientific research, with an initial focus on scientific conferences and experimental laboratories. For example, the 2019 Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union was estimated to emit 80,000 tons of CO2e* (tCO2e), equivalent to the average weekly emissions of the city of Edinburgh, UK. The annual carbon footprint of a typical life science laboratory has been estimated to be around 20 tCO2e. But there is one aspect of research that often gets overlooked - and which can have a substantial environmental impact: high performance and cloud computing. In 2020, the Information and Communication Technologies sector was estimated to have made up between 1.8% and 2.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions - more than aviation (1.9%). In addition to the environmental effects of electricity usage, manufacturing and disposal of hardware, there are also concerns around data centres' water usage and land footprint. Professor Michael Inouye said: \"While the environmental impact of experimental 'wet' labs is more immediately obvious, the impact of algorithms is less clear and often underestimated. While new hardware, lower-energy data centres and more efficient high performance computing systems can help reduce their impact, the increasing ubiquity of artificial intelligence and data science more generally means their carbon footprint could grow exponentially in coming years if we don't act now.\" To help address this issue, the team has developed GREENER (Governance, Responsibility, Estimation, Energy and embodied impacts, New collaborations, Education and Research), a set of principles to allow the computational science community to lead the way in sustainable research practices, maximising computational science's benefit to both humanity and the environment.Governance and Responsibility Everyone involved in computational science has a role to play in making the field more sustainable: individual and institutional responsibility is a necessary step to ensure transparency and reduction of greenhouse gas emission. For example, institutions themselves can be key to managing and expanding centralised data infrastructures, and in ensuring that procurement decisions take into account both the manufacturing and operational footprint of hardware purchases. IT teams in high performance computing (HPC) centres can play a key role, both in terms of training and helping scientists monitor the carbon footprint of their work. Principal Investigators can encourage their teams to think about this issue and give access to suitable training. Funding bodies can influence researchers by requiring estimates of carbon footprints to be included in funding applications.Estimate and report the energy consumption of algorithms Estimating and monitoring the carbon footprint of computations identifies inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement. User-level metrics are crucial to understanding environmental impacts and promoting personal responsibility. The financial cost of running computations is often negligible, particularly in academia, and scientists may have the impression of unlimited and inconsequential computing capacity. Quantifying the carbon footprint of individual projects helps raise awareness of the true costs of research.Tackling Energy and embodied impacts through New collaborations Minimising carbon intensity - that is, the carbon footprint of producing electricity - is one of the most immediately impactful ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This could involve relocating computations to low-carbon settings and countries, but this needs to be done with equity in mind. Carbon intensities can differ by as much as three orders of magnitude between the top and bottom performing high-income countries (from 0.10 gCO2e/kWh in Iceland to 770 gCO2e/kWh in Australia). The footprint of user devices is also a factor: one estimate found that almost three-quarters (72%) of the energy footprint of streaming a video to a laptop is from the laptop, with 23% used in transmission and a mere 5% at the data centre. Another key consideration is data storage. The carbon footprint of storing data depends on numerous factors, but the life cycle footprint of storing one terabyte of data for a year is of the order of 10 kg CO2e. This issue is exacerbated by the duplication of such datasets in order for each institution, and sometimes each research group, to have a copy. Large (hyperscale) data centres are expected to be more energy efficient, but they may also encourage unnecessary increases in the scale of computing (the 'rebound effect').Education and Research Education is essential to raise awareness of the issues with different stakeholders. Integrating sustainability into computational training courses is a tangible first step toward reducing carbon footprints. Investing in research that will catalyse innovation in the field of environmentally sustainable computational science is a crucial role for funders and institutions to play. Recent studies found that the most widely-used programming languages in research, such as R and Python, tend to be the least energy efficient ones, highlighting the importance of having trained Research Software Engineers within research groups to ensure that the algorithms used are efficiently implemented. There is also scope to use current tools more efficiently by better understanding and monitoring how coding choices impact carbon footprints. Dr Lannelongue said: \"Computational scientists have a real opportunity to lead the way in sustainability, but this is going to involve a change in our culture and the ways we work. There will need to more transparency, more awareness, better training and resources, and improved policies. \"Cooperation, open science, and equitable access to low-carbon computing facilities will also be crucial. We need to make sure that sustainable solutions work for everyone, as they frequently have the least benefit for populations, often in low- and middle-income countries, who suffer the most from climate change.\" Professor Inouye added: \"Everyone in the field - from funders to journals to institutions down to individuals - plays an important role and can, themselves, make a positive impact. We have an immense opportunity to make a change, but the clock is ticking.\" The research was a collaboration with major stakeholders including Health Data Research UK, EMBL-EBI, Wellcome and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). *CO2e, or CO2-equivalent, summarises the global warming impacts of a range of greenhouse gases and is the standard metric for carbon footprints, although its accuracy is sometimes debated.

In an [article published today in the journal Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01979-x), Professor Andrew Balmford at the University of Cambridge, and Professor Ian Bateman at the University of Exeter, urge policy-makers to consider a bolder approach known as 'land sparing' - which they argue is cheaper, more effective, and avoids displacing food production and worsening the loss of wildlife habitats overseas. Land sparing involves finding lower-impact ways to boost yields in farmed areas, and allow larger, non-farmed areas of the landscape to be put aside for nature - without increasing imports and damaging overseas wildlife. The researchers say the approach has been overlooked by policymakers because of a failure to consider the wider consequences of changes in land management. They argue that changes that boost wildlife locally seem superficially attractive, but if food production is reduced there are unavoidable knock-on effects elsewhere that must also be taken into account. They also cite the influence of the 'Big Farm' lobby in maintaining the status quo in agricultural policy, with land-sharing subsidies allocated using a flat rate per hectare, which disproportionately benefits the biggest farms - resulting in the largest 12 per cent of farms taking 50 per cent of all UK taxpayer subsidies. Their article debunks some of the benefits to biodiversity of three widely-advocated green farming approaches. They argue that while policy funded measures such as reducing the use of pesticides and fertilisers can sometimes increase populations of more common animals and plants on farms it does little for endangered birds, invertebrates, plants and fungi species that need larger stretches of non-farmed habitat - and by lowering yields can also make matters far worse for overseas biodiversity. Rewilding initiatives, where large areas of land are taken out of farming, can indeed benefit locally endangered species. But unless other areas see compensating increases in food output then this reduces local production, increases demand for food imports, and so damages biodiversity overseas. They also argue that organic farming, where crops are produced without manufactured fertilisers and modern pesticides, is even more likely to be damaging. Relatively few species will benefit in the farmed area, and the substantially lower yields from this type of farming risk greatly increasing the need for food imports, and hence a country's impacts on biodiversity elsewhere. Land sparing, in contrast, involves retaining or creating sizeable blocks of unfarmed land containing larger populations of the many species that depend on natural habitats, as well as boosting farm yields elsewhere in the region so that overall production is maintained or even increased. Promising methods to boost crop and livestock yields more sustainably than current high-yield practices include genomic screening and gene editing to accelerate animal and crop breeding; using new advances in aquaculture to produce high value foods with much lower environmental impacts; and, in tropical countries, greater access to improved pasture and veterinary care. The researchers point to field studies on five continents that consistently show how land sparing delivers far greater biodiversity gains than conventional 'nature friendly farming' policies. They say it is likely to cost a great deal less as well: [a survey of UK farmers last year](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pan3.10422) found that land sparing could deliver the same biodiversity outcomes for birds as conventional approaches but at 48 per cent of the cost to taxpayers, and with a 21 per cent lower impact on food production. Professor Bateman, a Professor of Environmental Economics at the University of Exeter Business School who has advised seven UK secretaries of state for the environment in the past decade, said: \"The stakes are too high for policymakers to continue to ignore the promise of land sparing when so much research demonstrates that it is a far more effective approach than many of the strategies being deployed. \"Unless researchers and policymakers assess the overall, global effects of interventions aimed at addressing biodiversity loss and climate change, poor decisions that are unsupported by the data will at best under-deliver, and at worst exacerbate existential threats posed by the extinction and climate crises.\" Andrew Balmford, a Professor of Conservation Science at the University of Cambridge who has led 20 years' work investigating how to reconcile food production with biodiversity conservation, added: \"This issue has become even more urgent since last December when many countries agreed to help meet the Convention on Biological Diversity's goal of protecting 30 per cent of the planet's land and oceans by 2030. \"Exactly how this 30 per cent will be put aside - and how we meet humanity's growing needs on the rest of planet - will in large part determine the biodiversity consequences of this ambitious commitment.\" Reference Bateman, I. and Balmford, A.: ' [Current conservation policies risk accelerating biodiversity loss](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01979-x).' Nature, June 2023. Adapted from a press release by the University of Exeter. Rewilding, organic farming and the so-called 'nature friendly farming' measures included in some government conservation policies may accelerate global biodiversity loss, say two leading researchers.

[Attribution](/taxonomy/imagecredit/attribution)News type: [News](/taxonomy/news-type/news)Super Tags: [Environment](/taxonomy/super-tags/environment) [Weak policies and political ideologies risk jeopardising plans to tackle health and climate change, says Cambridge expert](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/weak-policies-and-political-ideologies-risk-jeopardising-plans-to-tackle-health-and-climate-change) Writing in the journal Science and Public Policy, Professor Marteau argues that this 'evidence-neglect' is a result of incentive structures that encourage politicians to set ambitious policy goals while simultaneously disincentivising them from implementing the policies needed to achieve them, and of political ideologies and interests that conflict with effective policies. Two changes could mitigate these factors, she writes: engaging citizens more in policy-making so their interests dominate; and increasing the accountability of politicians through legally binding systems for all stages of policy-making. Recent UK governments have set ambitious goals to improve the nation's health and tackle climate change. These include halving childhood obesity by 2030, eradicating smoking by 2030, narrowing the gap in healthy life expectancy by 2030, and achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But, says Professor Marteau, Director of the Behaviour and Health Research Unit at Cambridge, \"None of these ambitions is on course. Of course, scientific evidence is just one of many sources of information for policymakers to consider, but neglecting evidence is a sure-fire route to unsuccessful policymaking.\" According to predictions, childhood obesity is on track to double, not halve, by 2030. Smoking eradication is on track sometime after 2050, not by 2030. By 2030, the gap in healthy life expectancy between local areas where it is highest and lowest will have narrowed, but by 2035 is set to rise by five years. And the UK Sixth Carbon Budget - a key target towards achieving net zero carbon emissions - is likely to be missed by \"a huge margin\". Achieving each of these ambitions requires sustained changes in several sets of behaviour across all socio-economic groups including what we eat, drink, whether we smoke, and how we travel. A wealth of research demonstrates that achieving such change is difficult, requiring many interventions that change the environments or systems that too readily cue, reinforce and maintain unhealthier and unsustainable behaviours. \"There are many possible reasons why these policy ambitions are so far off-track, but chief among them is the neglect of evidence, particularly around achieving sustained changes in behaviour across populations,\" said Professor Marteau. \"Put simply, these failures are baked-in, given the policies designed to achieve these ambitions are based on interventions that cannot achieve the change required.\" Part of the problem, she says, lies in the incentive structures for politicians, which favour setting ambitious policy goals whether as part of achieving election promises, attracting positive publicity or both. But they also discourage the policies needed to achieve them. \"Fear of electoral damage plays a role here. Take taxes on tobacco, alcohol, junk food and carbon emissions: these are among the most effective interventions for improving health and the climate, but they are unpopular with the public and so politicians are unwilling to adopt them.\" Such policies may not just be unpopular with the public - they may also run counter to political interests and ideologies. Neoliberalism, for example, emphasises a small role for governments in the economy and public policy more generally, and a larger role for individuals to be personally responsible for behaving in ways to achieve health, wealth and happiness. Such ideologies often portray attempts by the government to intervene as 'Nanny Statism'. Certain industries, too, focus on personal responsibility to discourage politicians from adopting effective policies that conflict with their industries' interests, such as those aimed at reducing consumption of fossil fuels, tobacco, alcohol, meat and junk food. These industries may cast doubt on the effectiveness of policies that would reduce their sales, as well as lobbying governments to persuade them of the business case for the status quo. Professor Marteau added: \"There are no quick or single fixes to overcoming these problems, but there are two changes which could help: engaging citizens more in priority setting and policy design, and increasing the accountability of politicians through introducing legally-binding systems for reporting progress on policy ambitions.\" There are a number of options available to policymakers when it comes to engaging citizens, including: surveys, focus groups, town hall meetings and citizen assemblies, as well as working with civil society organisations. This approach has the potential to reduce the political costs of unpopular policies by exposing citizens to evidence for the effectiveness of policies, which - across many studies - has been shown to increase policy support. Policies designed with citizen engagement also attract more public support, such policies being seen as fairer and more successful as a result. Introducing legally binding systems for reporting policies and progress on policy ambitions, with plans to get back on track if progress is off course, could be a powerful way to decrease the neglect of evidence which is central to policy success. An example of this is the UK government's recent Levelling Up strategy paper, which included plans to introduce a statutory obligation for government to report annually on progress towards meeting the Levelling Up missions. Alongside these plans, it published a set of metrics against which to measure progress against the missions and evaluate the success of the strategy. \"Although these requirements are by no means perfect, the legislation as drafted will at least allow parliament significantly more scrutiny of progress towards a government ambition than is often the case.\" Failure to take into account the evidence, says Professor Marteau, risks undermining the government's attempts to take action. \"Laudable policy ambitions to improve a nation's health and protect life on the planet will remain unfulfilled ambitions unless and until evidence is given a more central role in the policy-making process.\" Reference Marteau, TM.

[Project launched to provide guidance on research using human stem cell-based embryo models](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/project-launched-to-provide-guidance-on-research-using-human-stem-cell-based-embryo-models) The Governance of Stem Cell-Based Embryo Models (G-SCBEM) project is led by [Cambridge Reproduction](https://www.repro.cam.ac.uk/) and brings together scientists, legal scholars and bioethics experts, as well as representatives from major funders and regulators of this research. Stem cell-based embryo models (SCBEMs) are three-dimensional structures that mimic aspects of embryo development. They can be created from embryonic stem cells, which can be persuaded to form structures that share a number of features with the embryonic blastocyst stage - the stage at which, in conception, the embryo begins the process of implanting into the uterus. SCBEMs may offer insight into these critical stages of early development - stages that are normally inaccessible to researchers. They also offer potential for understanding some of the problems that can affect early pregnancies and lead to miscarriage or birth defects. Given that one in four pregnancies is estimated to end in miscarriage, this research has the potential to transform treatments for recurrent miscarriage and to improve the success rates of IVF and other fertility treatments. Research using human embryos in the UK is tightly regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, which prohibits scientists from culturing human embryos in the lab beyond 14 days. However, despite the resemblance to human blastocysts (the cluster of cells that forms about five days after an egg is fertilised), SCBEMS are not themselves embryos. They can be derived from embryonic stem cells but can only form in specific conditions within the laboratory. Because of this, they do not fall under the remit of the HFE Act. Currently there is no dedicated regulatory framework addressing research using SCBEMs, although existing UK law does prohibit them from ever being transferred into a woman's womb. Nonetheless, the absence of clear, transparent guidance in this area hinders research and risks damaging public confidence. Cambridge Reproduction, working in partnership with the Progress Educational Trust (PET), aims to break this deadlock by producing a clear and comprehensive recommended governance framework - a set of voluntary guidelines - for research using SCBEMs. As this is an emerging area of research, the team is consulting widely to determine the opportunities, areas of consensus and concerns posed by SCBEMs. The consultation will also lay the groundwork for engaging the public and other stakeholders in a parallel two-way dialogue around the use of SCBEMs for research and in translation. \"This is a fast-developing area and the project will open important dialogues with researchers, funders, regulators and the general public,\" said Professor Kathy Niakan, Chair of Cambridge Reproduction. \"We hope that the resulting self-governance framework will enable scientists to proceed with their research with confidence, while maintaining public trust in this vital area of research.\" \"Given the similarities that SCBEMs have with human embryos, they offer enormous potential to unlock secrets of early pregnancy,\" said Professor Roger Sturmey from Hull York Medical School, Chair of the G-SCBEM Guidelines Working Group. \"However, because of these similarities, it is important that scientists working in this field maintain high standards and public confidence and so we hope that a self-governance framework will provide this.\" Sandy Starr, Deputy Director of PET and a member of the G-SCBEM Oversight Group, said, \"SCBEMs open up avenues of research that are vitally important for people affected by infertility or genetic conditions. Use of SCBEMs can advance our understanding of human development, disease and reproduction, improving established reproductive technologies while opening up new possibilities. For this research to thrive, it needs to be conducted responsibly and governed in a clear and transparent way, which is where the G-SCBEM project comes in.\" The G-SCBEM guidance will be launched in the late autumn, and will be regularly reviewed to ensure that it keeps pace with new scientific developments. The G-SCBEM project is funded by grants from the BBSRC Impact Acceleration Account and the University of Cambridge Impact and Knowledge Exchange fund.

[DNA discovery highlights how we maintain healthy blood sugar levels after meals](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/dna-discovery-highlights-how-we-maintain-healthy-blood-sugar-levels-after-meals) The findings, published today in Nature Genetics, could help inform future treatments of type 2 diabetes, which affects around 4 million people in the UK and over 460 million people worldwide. Several factors contribute to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, such as older age, being overweight or having obesity, physical inactivity, and genetic predisposition. If untreated, type 2 diabetes can lead to complications, including eye and foot problems, nerve damage, and increased risk of heart attack and stroke. A key player in the development of the condition is insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar - glucose - levels. People who have type 2 diabetes are unable to correctly regulate their glucose levels, either because they don't secrete enough insulin when glucose levels increase, for example after eating a meal, or because their cells are less sensitive to insulin, a phenomenon known as 'insulin resistance'. Most studies to date of insulin resistance have focused on the fasting state - that is, several hours after a meal - when insulin is largely acting on the liver. But we spend most of our time in the fed state, when insulin acts on our muscle and fat tissues. It's thought that the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance after a so-called 'glucose challenge' - a sugary drink, or a meal, for example - play a key role in the development of type 2 diabetes. Yet these mechanisms are poorly-understood. Professor Sir Stephen O'Rahilly, Co-Director of the Wellcome-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science at the University of Cambridge, said: \"We know there are some people with specific rare genetic disorders in whom insulin works completely normally in the fasting state, where it's acting mostly on the liver, but very poorly after a meal, when it's acting mostly on muscle and fat. What has not been clear is whether this sort of problem occurs more commonly in the wider population, and whether it's relevant to the risk of getting type 2 diabetes.\" To examine these mechanisms, an international team of scientists used genetic data from 28 studies, encompassing more than 55,000 participants (none of whom had type 2 diabetes), to look for key genetic variants that influenced insulin levels measured two hours after a sugary drink. The team identified new 10 loci - regions of the genome - associated with insulin resistance after the sugary drink. Eight of these regions were also shared with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, highlighting their importance. One of these newly-identified loci was located within the gene that codes for GLUT4, the critical protein responsible for taking up glucose from the blood into cells after eating. This locus was associated with a reduced amount of GLUT4 in muscle tissue. To look for additional genes that may play a role in glucose regulation, the researchers turned to cell lines taken from mice to study specific genes in and around these loci. This led to the discovery of 14 genes that played a significant role in GLUT 4 trafficking and glucose uptake - with nine of these never previously linked to insulin regulation. Further experiments showed that these genes influenced how much GLUT4 was found on the surface of the cells, likely by altering the ability of the protein to move from inside the cell to its surface. The less GLUT4 that makes its way to the surface of the cell, the poorer the cell's ability to remove glucose from the blood. Dr Alice Williamson, who carried out the work while a PhD student at the Wellcome-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, said: \"What's exciting about this is that it shows how we can go from large scale genetic studies to understanding fundamental mechanisms of how our bodies work - and in particular how, when these mechanisms go wrong, they can lead to common diseases such as type 2 diabetes.\" Given that problems regulating blood glucose after a meal can be an early sign of increased type 2 diabetes risk, the researchers are hopeful that the discovery of the mechanisms involved could lead to new treatments in future. Professor Claudia Langenberg, Director of the Precision Healthcare University Research Institute (PHURI) at Queen Mary University of London and Professor of Computational Medicine at the Berlin Institute of Health, Germany, said: \"Our findings open up a potential new avenue for the development of treatments to stop the development of type 2 diabetes. It also shows how genetic studies of dynamic challenge tests can provide important insights that would otherwise remain hidden.\" The research was supported by Wellcome, the Medical Research Council and the National Institute for Health and Care Research.
