The first refers to the infinitive (to project) but we don't list entries under the infinitives. Sorry, 50% chance I've worded a lot of entries incorrectly. (Could even be [[project|to project]] but that's a lot of typing.) [JillianE](/wiki/User:JillianE) 19:47, 1 January 2006 (UTC) - The second. So long as it isn't conjugated (e.g., projected, projects) then it's technically still infinitive (i.e., infinite, or unlimited by a subject), with or without the particle to. For example, go in \"I let her (to) go\" is an infinitive. [Primetime](/w/index.php?title=User:Primetime&action=edit&redlink=1)20:10, 1 January 2006 (UTC) Icon proposal Hello, I was thinking about putting icons like in french wiktionary, for the etymology, pronunciation, word type, translations and see also. You can look to an example here : [http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/homme](https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/homme) . What do you think ? [Optimix](/wiki/User:Optimix) 23:35, 3 January 2006 (UTC) - This is not the right place to discuss this. But this issue has been disucussed in the right place; see [WT:BP#Neat icons](/wiki/Wiktionary:BP#Neat_icons). I don't think we are going to have icons. [Ncik](/wiki/User:Ncik)02:06, 4 January 2006 (UTC) - ok, I see thanks [Optimix](/wiki/User:Optimix)05:58, 4 January 2006 (UTC) - ok, I see thanks Pupu, Pu-pu? Hawaiian? Need a definition. See [pu pu](/wiki/pu_pu) [SemperBlotto](/wiki/User:SemperBlotto) 16:53, 8 January 2006 (UTC) Currently we only have the unhyphenated spelling but that one includes the hyphenated as a variant. This does not accord with other dictionaries. My Diccionario Oxford Pocket lists the unhyphenated form as only a verb and the hyphenated only as a noun. Encarta online does the same. Collins online redirects each to the same article under \"rip off\" with the \"rip-off\" spelling coming in at the end of their definition #2 in an unclear way which could mean that it applies only to the following entries, which is where their noun senses begin. At any rate we need to do more work on this to see if it's a US v. UK thing or just different dictionaries taking different POVs, in either case we must not take any POV and cover all of them equally. \u2014 [Hippietrail](/wiki/User:Hippietrail) 17:36, 11 January 2006 (UTC) - Broadly, we have the following: two words ( [phrasal verb](/wiki/phrasal_verb)); single word, hyphenated (UK spelling of noun from phrasal verb); single word, unhyphenated (US spelling of noun, and, increasingly, a variant spelling in the UK). I'm glad to see that Wiktionary is not going the way of some less well-edited newspapers and the like and letting hyphens slip into phrasal verbs, which are never hyphenated. In any case, yes, we need to do some research to see where the hyphenated and closed-up forms are used. \u2014 [Paul G](/wiki/User:Paul_G)17:43, 11 January 2006 (UTC) crew cut, crew-cut The entry [](/wiki/%D1%91%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%BA) gives the translation crew-cut (a style of haircut). In electronic dictionary WordNet and in my English-Russian and Russian-English dictionary (Kenneth Katzner), I can only find unhyphenated version crew cut. Which one is correct? And if both, should I list both in the translation? Thanks, \u2014 [Oleg Katsitadze](/wiki/User:Oleg_Katsitadze) 09:56, 12 January 2006 (UTC) [crew cut](/wiki/crew_cut) is normal. [crewcut](/wiki/crewcut) is an acceptable alternative. the hyphenated form might, I suppose, be used as an adjective. I would only list the two-word version in a translation. [SemperBlotto](/wiki/User:SemperBlotto) 10:08, 12 January 2006 (UTC) - I feel rather than just saying what's normal and what's acceptable that we should say who says so. In this case Collins, Encarta, and Merriam-Webster only list crew cut. AHD lists crewcut first and crew cut second. None lists a hyphenated form. I always prefer to list all forms in translations. Somebody needing translations can then compare the entries and see what suits their needs best. \u2014 [Hippietrail](/wiki/User:Hippietrail)18:20, 12 January 2006 (UTC) use of would Can some explain the use of would in the following sample from wikipedia where \"would see\" really means \"saw\"? - \"In 1994, Parmalee would see more time with the Dolphins' offense.\" Is this a tense or a mode or what? (The whole article was written like this but has been changed to past tense, I'm just wonder.) [JillianE](/wiki/User:JillianE) 14:37, 12 January 2006 (UTC) I don't know what this is called but it's often used when relating a sequence of past events in which from Parmalee's time at the beginning of the sequence, the other points are in his/her future even though they are in the reader's past. \u2014 [Hippietrail](/wiki/User:Hippietrail) 18:15, 12 January 2006 (UTC) Quite apart from the RFD, this article is very much below par. The definitions are very poor and muddled. Currently they are: - (computing) the process of making files available to others to download from the Internet - (computing) the use of a file sharing network, or peer-to-peer software It is clear that the original and still-used sense of this term is in regard to local area networking or other types of networking where a certain service makes directories and files from some other computer accessible as though they are on the local computer. Examples are [w:AppleTalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleTalk), [w:RFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFS), and [SMB or Samba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block). The newer and possible now more common sense covers the use of specialized peer-to-peer file-sharing networks over the internet. The same which are controversial when used for copyrighted material. Both of the current senses are actually for this sense. In fact the current sense 1 seems to be a specialization of sense 2. For instance it appears the current sense 2 would cover any use of Napster or Kazaa whereas sense 1 would cover only using Napster or Kazaa for posting files. Am I missing something? \u2014 [Hippietrail](/wiki/User:Hippietrail) 18:10, 12 January 2006 (UTC) - It would seem that is what is being gone for: the first sense is the literal sense of [sharing](/wiki/share) [files](/wiki/file)as applied to computing, and the second is apparently the broader, more idiomatic sense of being involved in file sharing/piracy from either end. Now, I could see rewriting the first sense to be agnostic as to whether a client-server or peer-to-peer network is used (and also to whether it is over the Internet or a local network), and making the second sense more specific to how it is used, thus: - (computing) The act or process of making files available over a computer network such as the Internet. - The use of a peer-to-peer file-sharing network, especially in violation of copyright. - ... or some such. \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)18:16, 13 January 2006 (UTC) - Those may be closer but still off the mark. For sense #1 it feels more like the term for the system rather than just the use of it - but that needs to be checked. But in any case you don't have to make any files available - you might instead join the network and use the files made available on other systems. It still seems pretty fuzzy though. - As for sense #2 I don't think it's restricted just to the use of the system, it's certainly very commonly used attributively as in \"file sharing system\" - though hyphenation needs to be thoroughly checked in that case too. - Thanks for helping me think about it, Muke! \u2014 [Hippietrail](/wiki/User:Hippietrail)01:57, 14 January 2006 (UTC) - I think one of the distinctions being made is that 'share' has two meanings: there's sharing with, when you give part of, say, a sandwich, to someone else; and then there's sharing in, where you take part in someone else's sandwich. So if you say \"I can't get file sharing to work with my new box\", you mean you are trying to give away files (share them with people, sense 1), but when the government and publishers talk about \"cracking down on file sharing\" they are considering the system as a whole, where the relevant people are both the sharers-with and the sharers-in, thus sense 2. ...if that makes any sense. \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)18:16, 15 January 2006 (UTC) - I think one of the distinctions being made is that 'share' has two meanings: there's sharing with, when you give part of, say, a sandwich, to someone else; and then there's sharing in, where you take part in someone else's sandwich.

What we should do is check several authoratative sources (well-known dictionaries or etymology sites), if all agree list what they say. If some disagree list the alternatives in the order of most agreement. If all or most agree but there are persistent claims of some other etymology we should include it as a kind of discussion item or point of interest, perhaps under a subheading such as \"Word history\" or \"Folk etymologies\" etc. \u2014 [Hippietrail](/wiki/User:Hippietrail) 18:43, 12 January 2006 (UTC) - Just to confuse things, the OED says it's short for the Swedish trampcykel med motor och pedaler 'push-bike with motor and pedals'. There's certainly no way it's got anything to do with the word [mope](/wiki/mope), as currently stated. [Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith)12:18, 13 January 2006 (UTC) - It doesn't actually state that. There are two separate etymology headings and two separate etymologies. [moped](/wiki/moped)is the past participle and simple past of [mope](/wiki/mope). The etymology of the noun has nothing to do with the etymology of the verb form. [Uncle G](/wiki/User:Uncle_G)13:01, 13 January 2006 (UTC) - Whoops, you're absolutely right. I was skimming, badly. [Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith)14:54, 13 January 2006 (UTC) - Whoops, you're absolutely right. I was skimming, badly. - It doesn't actually state that. There are two separate etymology headings and two separate etymologies. scoot over I wonder whether [scoot](/wiki/scoot) over means only something like slide aside (while sitting), or, more generally, move aside? I've only heard it in the first sense. \u2014 [Oleg Katsitadze](/wiki/User:Oleg_Katsitadze) 12:15, 13 January 2006 (UTC) I would say that it means move aside-- [Go](/w/index.php?title=User:Go&action=edit&redlink=1) 15:05, 15 January 2006 (UTC) - The usual sense is indeed something like 'move one's seat aside' when it is a command. However a cursory google print search shows there is also the occasional \"scoot over to\" where 'over' does not belong to 'scoot' (e.g. 'they scooted over to the windows' = 'they scooted [over to the windows]'). Incidentally standing policy would put the move-the-seat-aside sense at [scoot over](/wiki/scoot_over)with a link from [scoot](/wiki/scoot). \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)18:05, 15 January 2006 (UTC) [Dangherous](/wiki/User:Dangherous)was quicker than me :). Can you (or someone) please check I understand correctly what you mean. I removed the move aside meaning from [scoot](/wiki/scoot), and added seat to the definition of [Dangherous](/wiki/User:Dangherous), with an example. \u2014 [Oleg Katsitadze](/wiki/User:Oleg_Katsitadze)21:49, 15 January 2006 (UTC) What is the current trademark status of this word? Should it be capitalised? \u2014 [Paul G](/wiki/User:Paul_G) 16:55, 13 January 2006 (UTC) - All dictionaries capitalize it. It's capitalized in articles in Britannica, as well. -- [Primetime](/w/index.php?title=User:Primetime&action=edit&redlink=1)15:09, 15 January 2006 (UTC) - Many books do not capitalize it (but then again, many others do). \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)17:57, 15 January 2006 (UTC) - Many books do not capitalize it (but then again, many others do). \u2014 high style? What is the correct way to mark a word or phrase which is pompous, bombastic? Russian expression for this is and the literal translation is high style. I can't seem to find a good translation for this. I need this to mark a translation of the Russian [](/wiki/%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BD%D1%8C). Thanks. \u2014 [Oleg Katsitadze](/wiki/User:Oleg_Katsitadze) 20:31, 14 January 2006 (UTC) - I think the ordinary English word is \"formal\" - or is this unsuitable? \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)17:50, 15 January 2006 (UTC) - Not quite what I need. [](/wiki/%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BD%D1%8C)is not really formal, but rather pompous poetic or something :). \u2014 [Oleg Katsitadze](/wiki/User:Oleg_Katsitadze)19:19, 15 January 2006 (UTC) - Not quite what I need. - Well, there's poetic, but that may not be what you're looking for. Possibly 'formal' with a qualifier, e.g. exceedingly formal ? I think the ordinary English word ... at least, that's relatively NPOV ... is \"high-flown\", but I don't think that's a word much used in dictionary style. Someone else may need to step in and offer suggestions here :p \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)20:20, 15 January 2006 (UTC) - Well, there's poetic, but that may not be what you're looking for.

[Vildricianus](/wiki/User:Vildricianus)11:31, 21 January 2006 (UTC) deprecative? And another one \u2014 is deprecative a correct mark for a scornful, derisive term? I need this for Russian on the page for [](/wiki/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%8D%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%8F) (=Synonyms=). Thanks again. \u2014 [Oleg Katsitadze](/wiki/User:Oleg_Katsitadze) 21:19, 14 January 2006 (UTC) - \"deprecative\" and \"deprecatory\" are both acceptable, I think, but I think the more usual dictionary term is [pejorative](/wiki/pejorative). \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)17:53, 15 January 2006 (UTC) - This is exactly the word I was looking for! Thanks! \u2014 [Oleg Katsitadze](/wiki/User:Oleg_Katsitadze)19:21, 15 January 2006 (UTC) - This is exactly the word I was looking for! Thanks! \u2014 swain I think that second definition of [swain](/wiki/swain) contains a typo (cuntry instead of country), although this typo is probably was in Webster, since The Collaborative International Dictionary of English v.0.48 contains exact same typo (if this is a typo indeed). Oh, and the question, of course, is whether this is a typo, and should cuntry be replaced with country. Thanks. \u2014 [Oleg Katsitadze](/wiki/User:Oleg_Katsitadze) 21:38, 14 January 2006 (UTC) it might have not been a typo, so just check with the author of the article whoever that might be-- [Go](/w/index.php?title=User:Go&action=edit&redlink=1) 15:02, 15 January 2006 (UTC) - The author is [Poccil](/wiki/User:Poccil), and his/her [last contribution](/wiki/Special:Contributions/Poccil)was in December 2004. So I doubt contacting him/her will do any good. \u2014 [Oleg Katsitadze](/wiki/User:Oleg_Katsitadze)16:21, 15 January 2006 (UTC) - Yes, the author is Webster 1913 (see, e.g., at [e2's version](http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=swain)where 'cuntry' is repeated.) I would mend it to 'country,' as it is a spelling that will raise fewer eyebrows. (And yes, it does seem that 'country' is the word to which it should be referred; see google for [cuntry at gutenberg.org](http://www.google.com/search?q=cuntry+site%3Agutenberg.org)and [\"country gallant\"](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22country+gallant%22).) \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)17:48, 15 January 2006 (UTC) - Yes, the author is Webster 1913 (see, e.g., at Pseudoterguminal John Fowles's Mantissa concerns a man in a hospital suffering from a variety of psycho-sexual delusions. At one point, after he has been making lurid suggestions to his nurse about her and the other nurses, she says to him: '...if you are secretly attempting to drive us to coenonymphic or pseudoterguminal stimulation, I can tell you this now - no chance. Is that clearly understood?' Well, it isn't clearly understood, by me at any rate. I can work out what [coenonymphic](/w/index.php?title=coenonymphic&action=edit&redlink=1) means (I've stuck a page in for it), but [pseudoterguminal](/w/index.php?title=pseudoterguminal&action=edit&redlink=1) defeats me completely. Obviously both words are coinages, but what is he getting at? Is anyone here very good with their Greek who could hazard a guess? I have a first edition, so just possibly it's a spelling mistake which was later corrected, though a mistake for what I can't imagine. Any help or suggestions much appreciated. [Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith) 19:43, 19 January 2006 (UTC) - Actually the -minal indicates a (pseudo-?)Latin *tergumen (-inis, neut.), with a on to make it \"false-terguminal\". But \"tergumen\" doesnt seem to exist (the closest possibly is [tergum](/wiki/tergum)\"back\", i.e. part of the body). \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)19:39, 20 January 2006 (UTC) Yeah, [tergum](/wiki/tergum) had occured to me...it doesn't seem to fit, but who knows...I will probably just have to take it all as a general outburst of pretentiousness, which I suppose is part of the point.

Its harmless, as long as they leave it on that page and stay out of \"our area\" (unless they wish to contribute to Wiktionary, of course) - Wiktionary is of course not Wikipedia but to paraphrase Wikipedia, [Wiktionary is not a free host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_free_host,_blog,_or_webspace_provider), there is a good deal of latitude with user pages and in this instance there is an intention to limit the use to a couple of months but the phrase \"slippery slope\" springs to mind.

It's a fact of life that this word has become genericised whether the Xerox company likes it or not. We are only reporting on that. We can use \"xerox\" without violating trademarks because we are not producing a competing product. [Eclecticology](/wiki/User:Eclecticology)17:40, 26 January 2006 (UTC) - I see no reason to split the article. We decide whether in the generic sense it needs to be capitalized or not, we mark it as a trademark, somewhere in our policy we state that we do our best to find out if words are trademarks but we are no legal authority. Many of the online dictionaries even have a special POS for trademarks which may be related to the fact that only adjectives can be legally trademarked but in practice most people use them as nouns. - Companies use their own trademarks as nouns in noun phrases such as \"Xerox\u00ae brand\". [Davilla](/wiki/User:Davilla)02:00, 6 February 2006 (UTC) - Companies use their own trademarks as nouns in noun phrases such as \"Xerox\u00ae brand\". - In this case Encarta sets POS to trademark and capitalizes, Collins capitalizes and uses both noun and verb as POS noting in noun sense 1 that it is a trademark, OED capitalizes its noun entry but not its verb entry and gives the noncapped spelling as an alternative also for the noun. - After deciding how we handle all that we do not need an article for this or any other company which manufactures photocopiers unless our policy is to define all company names.

We decide whether in the generic sense it needs to be capitalized or not, we mark it as a trademark, somewhere in our policy we state that we do our best to find out if words are trademarks but we are no legal authority. Many of the online dictionaries even have a special POS for trademarks which may be related to the fact that only adjectives can be legally trademarked but in practice most people use them as nouns. - I don't think that the generic sense needs to be capitalized at all; I haven't looked, but I'm presuming that Connel's references back to the 1960's are not capitalized. Setting \"Trademark\" as a POS opens up a potential for a whole new argument that doesn't advance anything. The rationale that an abbreviation could stand for several different things (mostly but clearly not all nouns) doesn't apply for trademarks where the usage should be unique. - Obviously we shouldn't start adding all company names. [Xerox](/wiki/Xerox)is a clear candidate for an article because its name has led to the generic term.

[Eclecticology](/wiki/User:Eclecticology)01:29, 27 January 2006 (UTC) - 3120 hits with many beginning with a lower case letter seems like a good starting place. Google does have a few bugs in the way it presents things. Their references are normally to recent editions, and often ignore the fact that the first use of a word will be in a much earlier edition. - Here's what some big dictionaries do: - AHD (answers.com): 1 entry, 1 sense. no pos \"Xerox\" only. entry discusses that word is a trademark and that it \"often occurs in print in lowercase as a verb and noun\". - Collins word exchange: 1 entry. 2 senses. \"Xerox\" only. sense 1: pos=noun. trademark. 3 subsenses: process, machine, copy - Encarta online: 1 entry. pos=trademark \"Xerox\" only. - M-W online: 2 entries. entry 1: pos=verb \"xerox\" only. 2 senses. entry 2: pos=trademark \"Xerox\" only. 1 sense. - OED online: 2 entries. entry 1: pos=noun \"Xerox\" also \"xerox\". entry 2: pos=verb \"xerox\" also \"Xerox\". Plenty of citations given from 1952 to 1985 giving both uppercase and lowercase for both noun and verb including inflected forms. Also specifically states \"Hence xeroxed ppl. a., xeroxing vbl. n. (both also with capital initial).\" - Although capitalization was used more liberally in the past, common use recently, esp. very recently in the internet age, does not disagree with what is considered proper. Names are capitalized. Otherwise words are not capitalized by default. Specific exceptions have to be made where this is not true, e.g. for languages, the days of the week, etc. I'm in favor of using lower case for genericized trademarks, even in the noun sense, regardless of what other dictionaries do, to reflect the fact that the use is in a common sense rather than proper. The continued capitalization reflects that, the word having not gained acceptance, editors are careful not to make a faux pas. Think of what you would do if you looked up one of these words in a dictionary and found no entry. A conjugated verb would be more easily distinguished from the trademark, but a noun in the lower case would usually be considered erroneous because, \"Look here, there's no such word.\" The problem is that the genericization of trademarks does not occur in print; it occurs in speech, and print does not immediately recognize the generic term as a new word. By following the norm and listing a generic word as capitalized, dictionaries are only continuing a practice that counters standards everyone already agrees upon: \"Institute\" is capitalized in MIT, but not in general.

In one reference on the Google listing (They don't let me see the page) mentions the Wes Noonan book Hardening Network Infrastructure there is the sentence \"They are the folks with the 'been there, done that' t-shirts\".

It does go with a verb so that would make my educated guess by adverb but my educated guesses here have been wrong before. Also, is [het](/wiki/het)only an article or can it also be a pronoun under certain conditions - it feels like a pronoun to me, especially since it is not followed by a noun at all. My guess is it's similar in some ways (and different in others) to English [it](/wiki/it)in \"it's raining\". - My second guess would be that it's a particle, but I'm not sure if particles can be phrases. \u2014 [Hippietrail](/wiki/User:Hippietrail)22:26, 6 February 2006 (UTC) Sounds reasonable indeed. [het](/wiki/het) can indeed be used as a pronoun, but not in this case I guess. It sounds more like \"the working\".

For example, French has \"au\" (= \u00e0 + le, and Italian has \"al\" (= a + il), both of which mean \"to the\", \"at the\" or \"in the\". Because these are single words rather than phrases, as in Dutch, there is even more of a need to find a part of speech.

This has 300 Google hits (including various Wiktionary articles where I have used this as the part of speech) - see, for example [this page](http://italian.about.com/library/fare/blfare153a.htm). Might this be the appropriate term for [aan het](/wiki/aan_het) as well? (Let's not have \"prepositional articular phrase\", or the like, please :) ) I notice that the French and Italian articles for [au](/wiki/au) and [al](/wiki/al) now give the part of speech as preposition - this can't be right, surely, as these words are is never used before a pronoun. \"Prepositional article\" is more accurate, IMO. \u2014 [Paul G](/wiki/User:Paul_G) 12:04, 7 February 2006 (UTC) - I've always seen words like [al](/wiki/al)listed simply as contractions.

But our \"POS\" heading isn't just for \"parts of speech\" anyway but we don't have a better name for it. \"Part of speech\" is not even used by linguists any more and may well not be used by lexicographers either. The pocket dictionary in front of me in its how-to-use pages uses \"grammatical category\". OED actually does use \"part of speech\" but it still gives only \"contraction\" for Etymology of Brown Can someone look in the OED and tell me how far back the word [brown](/wiki/brown) goes? (My town library doesn't have an OED and I've never gotten around to going to the big town next-town over). Apparently the Chinese word for brown comes from the borrowed word for coffee and is a new creation. For us brown is the color of dirt but in China apparently the dirt has so much clay in it that it is a shade of yellow. Brown is a cognate for the German braun, so it looks to me to go back a ways in English but I'm curious. [JillianE](/wiki/User:JillianE) 01:52, 7 February 2006 (UTC) - Due to a TV series on the BBC the online OED is free for 48 hours each week, but not for much longer. The earliest cites for [brown](/wiki/brown)go back to about 1000AD for a couple of adjectival senses. It seems to have a \"Common Teutonic\" origin, but this etym is quite complex for me so maybe I've missed a bit. \u2014 [Hippietrail](/wiki/User:Hippietrail)15:58, 7 February 2006 (UTC) - I'm not sure I get exactly what you're asking, but \"brown\" is about as old a word as you can get. It was used in Old English (\"brun\") although then it meant either \"dark\" or, confusingly, \"bright, shining\". There's lots of talk in Old English poetry of \"brown-edged swords\", ie with shining or glittering blades. (The comparison with Chinese languages is interesting but obviously there's no relationship.) The word's association with a specific colour didn't come about till Middle English. [Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith)16:08, 7 February 2006 (UTC) - If I remember correctly 'brown' is one of the later color terms that comes latest to a language, regardless of what color dirt it's spoken on. Berlin and Kay did a study on basic color terms in languages awhile back, and found that languages have a rather strict (but not totally inflexible) hierarchy of color terminology: if the language has two basic color words, their canonical values will be black and white; if it has three, it has those two and red; if four, then those three and either green or yellow; if five, those four and the other of green or yellow; if six, those five and blue; if seven, those six and brown; if eight or more, those seven and some combination of purple, pink, orange, and grey. Germanic is interesting in that it has seemed to have gotten many of these color names early and lent them out (both 'brown' and 'blue' got sent into Romance languages). When B&K analyzed Chinese they only found six, presumably [](/wiki/%E7%99%BD%E8%89%B2)(white), [](/wiki/%E9%BB%91%E8%89%B2)(black), [](/wiki/%E7%BA%A2%E8%89%B2)(red), [](/wiki/%E7%BB%BF%E8%89%B2)(green), [](/wiki/%E9%BB%84%E8%89%B2)(yellow), and atm to see]. [](/wiki/%E5%92%96%E5%95%A1%E8%89%B2)(brown, coffee-colored) appears to have become more common than the native (?) term [](/wiki/%E8%A4%90%E8%89%B2)(brown), suggesting a lack of 'basic'-ness to keeping it from being common. Having [](/wiki/%E7%B4%AB%E8%89%B2)(purple) appears to be an anomaly in the hierarchy, which may also be duplicated in Japanese. \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)19:11, 7 February 2006 (UTC) This one has one etymology but two different pronunciations for adjective and verb.

It says it's a letter in the Dutch alphabet, but for me (native Dutch speaker), this is the first time ever I see it. AFAIK, we use the letters I + J to form IJ, but here it seems to be one [grapheme](/wiki/grapheme). At least, I don't have it on my keyboard. I know of some people who use Y to represent the IJ, but that's certainly incorrect. Now there seems to be a dotted Y.

Should it be moved to the capitalized version (as per the Wikipedia article) or should the capitalized version redirect to the lower-case version? -- I've done some lookup, and there's a fair deal of bias involved actually. To be concise: some people think it's one letter, others think it's two; this is of little concern to us. Of course, I don't dispute the rule that \"ij\" needs an entry. The thing is, do we have that entry at [ij](/wiki/ij) (two characters) or at [](/wiki/%C4%B3) (one character, unicode U+0133)? I'd say [ij](/wiki/ij) (2), and a brief explanation (not a redirect) at [](/wiki/%C4%B3) (1). Because: no one would find the one-character entry unless they produce the letter by inserting a symbol in their wordprocessor and copy-pasting it. As a matter of fact, no one does write it in one letter at all on their keyboard. As an example, the [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nl:IJ_(letter)) wikipedia lets (1) redirect to ij (2), and in the entire text (also on the English WP), it is written as a combination of i + j. The one-character ligature does not really have the same status that [\u00df](/wiki/%C3%9F) or [\u00e6](/wiki/%C3%A6) do. The fact that both Van Dale and the Taalunie (two authorative sources) state that the one-character is wrong doesn't matter much in this case (bias). Now it's possible to suspect me of POV, and perhaps we need a Dutchman to comment on this matter. Don't get me wrong, however, ij is a letter in its own merit, being more than just a diphthong, and should indeed be written as IJ when capitalized. But not, I believe, as one character, this especially to enhance functionality here at Wiktionary. \u2014 [Vildricianus](/wiki/User:Vildricianus) 19:21, 9 February 2006 (UTC) - One point of response: one doesn't have to produce the ligature to look it up. One might find it 'in the wild' on the internet and come here to look it up by copy & paste (especially, say, if their system doesn't display the character in an expected manner). [\u00e6](/wiki/%C3%A6)is a special case btw... In Modern English it's a typographical nicety (even more so than the ij ligature, as a title-cased Ae is just as acceptable as \u00c6) though in some languages it's counted as a letter in its own right. Not being a Dutch expert I can't vouch for the unity or duality of the ij-graph, but I think we should follow Unicode's deprecation of the ligated glyph, 1) keeping articles (like [dijk](/wiki/dijk)) under the separated ij form and 2) accommodating abnormal data by allowing redirects from the -ligature. I would allow an article at [](/wiki/%C4%B3)though to explain the character, just as any other strange character, though in this case too I think a redirect to [ij](/wiki/ij)might be acceptable. \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)21:26, 9 February 2006 (UTC) - Reading the Wikipedia article on [w:\u00e6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%A6), I must say it has very much the same status in English as [w:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B3)has in Dutch. No official location in the alphabeth, commonly written as two seperate letters, but causing problems in names. Compare for example [w:Aeon Flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeon_Flux)which redirects to [w:\u00c6on Flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86on_Flux), while [w:arch\u00e6ology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arch%C3%A6ology)redirects to [w:archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archaeology). My opinion is, we can keep the common usage of two letters where it doesn't really matter (as in \"dijk\"), but should use the correct single letter when it actually makes a difference (as in \"muiden\"). Especially in the English Wikipedia and Wiktionary, since it is used there by non-Dutch who will not understand why \"ij\" is capitalized as \"\", while \"ei\" is capitalized as \"Ei\". -- [Pbb](/wiki/User:Pbb)13:18, 4 March 2006 (UTC) - Reading the Wikipedia article on Listing prepositions/combinations etc Me again. This could as well end up in the BP, but I ask here since it's about [eager](/wiki/eager). How do we actually list which prepositions it takes? Like: eager to do something / eager for something. Right in the definition? Each with an example sentence? Separate header? Separate entry? \u2014 [Vildricianus](/wiki/User:Vildricianus) 09:53, 9 February 2006 (UTC) - I can't comment on what's more correct, but I would strongly suggest using examples. The format may be changed, the wording of comments rejected, but a good example will stay, and a mediocre example more often improved than deleted. In general examples illustrate what was on someone's mind when they wrote a definition, sometimes doing a better job than the definition, poorly worded or approached. - I've been working on pages for a few phrasal verb, where adverbs and prepositions sometimes alter the meaning of the verb, and in some senses don't, and I've listed all senses as separate entries. However, in your case I would place usage notes to the extent they are warranted: eager followed by the infinitive of a verb, or by for in the case of a noun, indicates the object of desire.

The word mano in Italian and Spanish (and, with a different spelling, in Portuguese) looks as if it should be a masculine word, but in all three languages it is feminine. I read in a book several years ago that there is a good reason why mano is feminine, even though it looks masculine. However, the author did not go on to say what the good reason was. Does anybody know this 'good reason'? Shraddhan - Well the obvious immediate answer is that they are all descendents of a feminine word in Latin, [manus](/wiki/manus), though what the \"reason\" for its gender is I don't know. I believe the feminine -us ending is common for 4th declension, though my Latin is pretty basic. Manus comes from the same Indo-European base as Old English [mund](/wiki/mund)\"protection\" - also feminine - so these words may simply represent an Indo-European feminine class. [Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith)17:32, 10 February 2006 (UTC) - The Latin fourth declension is mostly masculines in -us and neuters in -u; [manus](/wiki/manus)is an exception even there (the other common exception plural; and [penus](/wiki/penus)\"store of food\" and [specus](/wiki/specus)\"cave\" which are also masculine). - In modern languages the gender is usually expected to relate to the word ending in -a or -o, but the original case was that *- was the feminine, and *-o- the masculine and neuter stem formant for regular adjectives only. Root nouns would have an inherent gender (having nothing to do with the last letter of the word), and particular derivative suffixes (applied to root nouns or verbs or whatever) would attach a gender, like -dad \"-ity\" does in Spanish, making anything it attaches to feminine. - As for [manus](/wiki/manus)and friends specifically... the Proto-Indo-European root may have been an r/n stem (whence also the Greek word [](/wiki/%CE%BC%CE%AC%CF%81%CE%B7)\"hand\"\u2014not the usual word\u2014is derived; so *m-r, *m-n-\u00e9s/*mnt\u00f3s in Pokorny, though only this [femur](/wiki/femur)(stem which also descend from it\u2014but it seems whatever *-u- extension was added (*man-u-) to make the stem decline more sanely also made it feminine. So unless the \"good reason\" was meant to be \"inheritance from the feminine Latin word [manus](/wiki/manus)\", I couldn't say what it would be. \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)19:33, 10 February 2006 (UTC) - The Latin fourth declension is mostly masculines in -us and neuters in -u; Since it's related, I might mention that I created a category for Spanish words of this sort, [Category:Spanish nouns with irregular gender](/wiki/Category:Spanish_nouns_with_irregular_gender). It would be a good idea to have such categories for Italian and any other languages which generally have regular gender endings (hence it wouldn't work for German). \u2014 [Hippietrail](/wiki/User:Hippietrail) 18:30, 10 February 2006 (UTC) Thanks for the info.

Peter Fenelon Collier (1849-1918) appears to be the same person that founded Collier's Weekly in 1888.

Clerical marriage, especially in rural areas, a matter of general acceptance by the C11th.\" [[3]](http://www.etss.edu/hts/hts2/notes21.htm). \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)16:31, 19 February 2006 (UTC) It seems that Nicholas II, Pope from 1058 - 1061 was the first Pope to argue for reform against clerical marriages. I have included a quote from the on-line Catholic Encyclopedia. (dont know how to do external links) but the reference is \"New Advent - The Catholic Encyclopedia\" see the articles on Nicholas II, Gregory VII and celebecy. This quote comes from the article on Nicholas II. - 'Early in his pontificate he had sent St. Peter Damiani and Bishop Anselm of Lucca as his legates to Milan, where a married and simoniacal clergy had recently given rise to a reform-party known as the \"Pataria\". A synod for the restoration of ecclesiastical discipline was held under the presidency of these envoys who, in spite of a tumultuous uprising which endangered their lives, succeeded in obtaining from Archbishop Guido and the Milanese clergy a solemn repudiation of simony and concubinage.' Gregory VII was the next Pope and it would seem that his proscriptions were a follow on from that of his predecessor. I think that this would be a more accurate derivation of the term, although it is not used in the encyclopedia at all. I am satisfied with this etymology, but will await consensus. Regards [Andrew massyn](/wiki/User:Andrew_massyn) - Yes, I ran across that information about Nicholas II. Given that 1) no source cited so far links this Nicholas to the etymon of Nicolaism, and 2) it seems highly unlikely that [-ism](/wiki/-ism)\u2014which when applied to names means following that person's doctrines or practices ( [Marxism](/wiki/Marxism), [McCarthyism](/wiki/McCarthyism), [Hamiltonism](/wiki/Hamiltonism))\u2014would be applied to the person who was against the practice, I decided not to offer it as a possible etymology. Compare [simony](/wiki/simony), a term often occurring alongside ' [nicholaism](/wiki/nicholaism),' also named after a person who practiced it, not a person who condemned it. \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)23:27, 20 February 2006 (UTC) Well I am humbled after all! I went to the local University, who went to the OED and Lo! Nicholaism is derived from Nicolaitanism which comes from Nicolatian. So this is the etymology will be putting in. According to Oxford, the Reverend Cawdrey (1604) held that a Nicolatian 'is an heretike, like Nicholas, who held that wiues should bee commmon to all alike' Where the Rev. Cawdrey got his info from is beyond me.

That is they are not equal partners. - In the examples for \"sense 1\" \"with\" can be replaced with \"together with\" in \"sense 3\" it normally can't.

When someone says I'm with you all the way!, they are just using the sense of being \"together with\" someone, albeit symbolically. Perhaps that metaphorical use deserves its own sense, perhaps not. It just jars with me, that's all. I note that in all the translations bar Romanian the two senses are identical - that's why I wanted to check on the Romanian.

Like in English the [together](/wiki/together) (Swedish: [tillsammans](/wiki/tillsammans)) is often left out. It is about how with is translated in other languages, like possibly as you meantioned Romanian.

Although we can use \"with\" to translate \"chez\", that is just idiomatic...the sense of the French c'est une obsession chez elle is really something like 'where she is concerned, it's an obsession'. Although...as I type this, I realise that in fact [with](/wiki/with)does indeed have that sense in English as well...hmm. I guess there is another sense to go in after all!

The act of \"fighting\" can in this case be \"symmetric\" or perhaps [reciprocal](/wiki/reciprocal)would be a better term. In the sentence \"I sail with/against the wind\" there no such relation between me and the wind as might be the case in \"I fight with/against you\". Note that it depends on the sense of fight what the sentence means. If we are boxing then \"with\" and \"against\" are synonyms. If we are in a war \"against\" usually implies that we are on opposite sides, if \"with\" is used however it can mean both \"together with\" (we fight on the same side) and \"against\". But as I said this a property what senses the verb can take not a property of any senses the prepositions can take. This should propably be meantioned in the usage notes. -- [Patrik Stridvall](/wiki/User:Patrik_Stridvall)11:19, 7 March 2006 (UTC) - Yes, but that more a property of a specific sense of the verb \"fight\" than that of the specific sense of the prepopostions \"with\" or \"against\".

Well, I supposed we could an additional sense to [with](/wiki/with). However, the more I look prepositions, the more I get the feeling that the trying to translate prepositions is like trying to fit something in a \"box\" there it doesn't belong. Swedish and English is very similar on a superfical level but translating prepositions is something I have learned more by example than looking in a dictionary. I'm trying to learn French and prepostions are what I find the most difficult. As for the other parts while it is sometimes difficult to remember all rules at least there are rules at least on some level. OK, I was exaggerating, of course there are rules governing prepostions too, but they are almost entirely unlike Swedish so I'm having a very hard time learning them. Sure someday I will learn French prepositions as well, but not likely through using dictionaries but rather from experience... - Hmm. Well, I supposed we could an additional sense to - I'm a programmer by profession and I have over time more and more have come to see prepostions more like the names of the parameters functions (read: verbs) can take. OK, the analogy is not really that good, but it is not that bad either. It is not really help me much in practise though. So I'm really at a loss in what to do, the only consolation is that it seems to me that everbody else is as well. I haven't seem anybody that has even done a half decent good of describing how prepositions are to be translated between two specific languages, let alone more than two... - So should we split \"in support of\" in two and add a sense \"in counterchange with\" where [against](/wiki/against)is a synonym instead of an antonym?

They are official European abbreviations for a number of food ingredients. They can be used on ingredient lists in any of the 25 EU member states. While the numbers go well over 1000 not every number is assigned so there are probably around 700 or so. They are not very popular with consumers (at least in the UK) so more often the ingredients are listed in full.

Is it E621 elsewhere or are there two systems? - I wouldn't call it a synonym either, I'd prefer a special heading \"E number\" just as I've made efforts for \"Scientific name\".

I'm sure the whole trademark argument has been had before, so I'll restrict my rant to the following three points: - Even the (American) National Association of Realtors never claims \"Realtor\u00ae\" is a trademark. It claims \"REALTOR\u00ae\" in all caps is a trademark. Are we too going to go to put it in all caps? (And if not, what is the point of listing the word under a third, completely imaginary form that's neither the actual trademark nor the spelling that regular people actually use?) - The word is not a trademark throughout the English-speaking world. We're under no obligation to distort our presentation of how a word is used world-wide because of some legal quirk in a couple of countries. - Even in countries where \"REALTOR\u00ae\" is a trademark, we're under no obligation to distort our presentation of how the word is actually used. The trademark owners do have a legal obligation to whine every time someone uses their trademark generically. The rest of us are under no legal obligation to pay any attention to their whining. (Our only legal obligation is not to try to pass ourselves off as being the trademark owner, which we obviously aren't.) I'm all in favour of keeping the usage note (corrected for case). It's an important thing to know about the word. I'm even in favour of keeping the capped version(s) with soft-redirection if necessary. But our main article explaining the meaning of \"realtor\" should be where it belongs -- under lowercased \"r\" with no wimpy \u00ae. No disrespect to realtors (some of my closest friends and parents, etc...). But coddling their marketing strategies ain't my job.

This would have some effect when someone would want to call himself a Realtor. Nothing that I saw dealt with the issue of the all caps form that they use in all their notice, and which appears to be the format in the 1947 registration application. These cases should not have any effect on those of us who write descriptive dictionaries. If the term is used generically, we merely observe the fact.

Yes, they have synonyms, as does \"dirty magazine\" (\"dirty\" in the same sense as the above), but merely having synonyms does not feature in our [criteria for inclusion](/wiki/Wiktionary:CFI). They are all the sum of their parts \"obscene film/joke/video\". - The main problem as I see it is that it is not obvious to non-native speakers what sense every combination with dirty takes.

On the one hand, it doesn't meet CFI. On the other hand, if it's listed as a synonym on another page, it should be possible to fill out the page. There is something fundamentally wrong about having permanently red links. The resolution to the problem is not to think about it. I would guess this theoretical conundrum is resolved in practice, that there's some invisible force resolved to removing as links phrases that don't meet CFI. (Invisible means it's not me, guys.) Regardless, it's a difficult angle to the theoretical question and probably not the best approach.

We also have - In my view, one of these does, and the rest don't: - Most of these, including colors, apply broadly, but there's a strong case to have [dirty bomb](/wiki/dirty_bomb)as a separate entry rather than a separate definition, IMO. Continuing that trend, I would rather list many of these as separate entries, [dirty trick](/wiki/dirty_trick)and [dirty money](/wiki/dirty_money)in addition to those above, and merge and generalize the definitions at [dirty](/wiki/dirty). \"Violating accepted standards or rules\" through \"considered morally corrupt\" all seem very similar, along the same vein. [Davilla](/wiki/User:Davilla)08:26, 25 March 2006 (UTC) - Well, it's a matter of degree. They are certainly secondary senses to the same primary sense, but as you can see they have different English synonyms and while I don't think you understand the Swedish translations, they translate differently depending of the exact sense. Dividing words in senses is very hard. I usually try to avoid dividing a primary sense just for translations unless I can find English synonyms that can't reasonable be said to attach to all secondary senses. - Unfortunately the synonym argument is in fact completely moot for senses. Looked at one way, synonyms and definitions serve the same purpose; the former are simply more concise. Another way to think of it is this: out of context, only certain words are universally synonymous with a certain sense. Given a context, the sphere of words that can convey the same meaning expands because the context restricts the meaning that we attach to those words. The same words wouldn't necessarily convey the same meaning in another context, which may lead one to conclude that a word must be defined differently in every context. However, this is not a wise approach. It will pretty much always be possible to divide an idea more and more finely, whether with definitions or with synonyms or with synonyms in certain contexts. So synonyms do not support a more restricted and narrowly defined definition any more that a more restricted and narrowly defined definition supports itself. - The same applies to translations if we think of them as synonyms in other languages. I believe the practice that's developed here is to define the word in English and if necessary annotate the translations. [Davilla](/wiki/User:Davilla)20:24, 28 March 2006 (UTC) - Almost all of our entries avoids the question of primary and secondary sense. It is a little unclear in general exactly what is a primary sense and what is a secondary sense but perhaps we should have a format that marks it somehow. But then different dictionaries seems to have different ideas on how to do the division so perhaps it better to avoid the question entirely. I don't know. - As for [dirty bomb](/wiki/dirty_bomb)well, I suppose that it falls under \"covered with or containing dirt or other unwanted substances\" and it doesn't really appear except with the synonyms of bomb. The same can to some extent be said of the weather sense. Possibly we should have a \"See [dirty bomb](/wiki/dirty_bomb)\" and \"See [dirty weather](/wiki/dirty_weather)\" instead of the translations. -- [Patrik Stridvall](/wiki/User:Patrik_Stridvall)10:04, 25 March 2006 (UTC) - Hold on! Just because radioactive material is unwanted doesn't mean the first sense fits at all. A dirty bomb isn't something you bring out the Ajax for.

It is always silent at the beginning of words, but this does not make it a vowel (just as the silent h in English words such as \"hour\" and \"honest\" is not a vowel). - There are two varieties of h in French: \"h muet\" (\"silent h\") and h aspir\u00e9 (\"aspirate h\"). Neither is pronounced in modern French, but words beginning with h muet cause certain preceding words to undergo elision or liaison, while this does not happen with those beginning with h aspir\u00e9. Elision means the contraction of certain words (such as \"le\", \"la\" and \"de\"); liaison means the pronunciation of the final, usually silent, consonant of the preceding word. - For example, \"homme\" (\"man\") begins with an h muet, pronounced rather than /d m/): liaison (the \"s\" of \"des\" is pronounced, which, usually, it is not) - In contrast, \"hibou\" (\"owl\") begins with an h aspir\u00e9, so we have: (\"some owls\"), which is pronounced /d ibu/: no liaison - Some words beginning with h come from French and were once pronounced similarly to how they are pronounced in French. Most of these words have ended up with the h being pronounced but a few haven't (such as \"honest\"). \"Hotel\" is one example - you'll still hear some older people pronounce it with a silent h (and I'm not talking about dropping the h - they would never pronounce it). Hence they it is quite correct for them to say \"an hotel\". - As Keffy says, the stress must be on a syllable other than the first for \"an\" to be used. Saying \"an historic...\" is popular with BBC newsreaders (and they seem to be among the few people in the country who use \"an\" instead of \"a\" here) but it is not really standard UK English any more (in that pretty much everyone says \"a historic...\"). - I would agree with Widsmith that it sounds pretentious but would prefer to mark it as \"old-fashioned\" or \"dated\" rather than \"archaic\", as many older people (and the BBC) still use it. \u2014 [Paul G](/wiki/User:Paul_G)15:28, 27 March 2006 (UTC) - Yes that sounds better.

You typically don't say \"Take the highway 101 to exit ...\" but instead \"Take 101 to exit...\". Obviously the first is grammatically correct, but colloquially unacceptable. That is, if you said (or wrote) the first, you would be laughed at. If this is a dialectal difference, it would perhaps explain the difference of opinion regarding the term's acceptability as an ordinary noun? - That said, the same does not seem to apply to all routes and highways in the US. That is, I think the second-most famous highway (after highway [101](/wiki/101)) in the US would be [Route 66](/wiki/Route_66).

This is not correct. The latter term derives from [pixel](/wiki/pixel), a mid-20th century term. The former term is at least a century older and comes from [pixie](/wiki/pixie).

I'll give the rule here. When a verb ends in single vowel + single consonant and is stressed on the final (or only) syllable, then the consonant at the end is doubled when adding suffixes such as -ed, -er and -ing; otherwise, it is not doubled. Hence: - set -> setter, setting (monosyllable ending in single vowel + consonant) - forget -> forgetting (ends in single vowel + consonant; final syllable is stressed) - target -> targeted, targeting (ends in a single vowel + consonant; stress is not on the final syllable, so the consonant is not doubled \u2014 note that this is a spelling that many people get wrong) - repeat -> repeated, repeater, repeating (stress is on the final syllable, but it ends in two vowels + consonant, so the consonant is not doubled) - However, in UK English, verbs ending in single vowel + l (\"el\") double the final l in all cases but one (see below), irrespective of where the stress falls. Hence: - travel -> travelled, traveller, travelling (but \"traveled\", \"traveler\" and \"traveling\" in US English, because the stress is not on the final syllable) - propel -> propelled, propellor, propelling in all varieties of English (because the stress is on the final syllable) - The only exception is \"unparalleled\", which is the spelling in all varieties of English (an exception to the UK rule as UK English would require \"unparallelled\"*). - There are some other exceptions in UK English, such as \"worshipping\", \"kidnapping\", which are stressed on the [antepenultimate](/wiki/antepenultimate)syllable, which would give \"worshiping\" and \"kidnaping\" according to the rule. US English allows \"worship\" and \"kidnap\" to be inflected with either single or double p, but \"formatting\" is the only spelling (maybe so it doesn't look like it should be pronounced \"for-mait-ing\"). - So the rule would suggest \"pixellated\" in UK English and \"pixelated\" in US English. I was non-committal about the spelling as I'm not sure whether these are the spellings used in the two countries. \u2014 [Paul G](/wiki/User:Paul_G)13:42, 18 April 2006 (UTC) - Yup, that's right...

The purpose of the citation subpage is to show use and development over history, which would include the various types of compounds possible in English. But their other purpose is to show that a particular variant is actually used. - At this early stage I'd say it's OK to redirect from one citation page to another, too link them with \"See also\" or \"Alternative spellings\", or to link both to a special combined page via either redirects or readable links. We can keep thinking about it and discussing it and finally choose which way works best.

It will become very important when we start to include a lot of obsolete or historical spellings. Personally I think all forms should link to the same citation page so that it shows a word's development over time. However, where quotes are included on the page itself (and it would be a shame to lose that altogether), I think they should reflect the specific spelling of the namespace. That seems to be the best of both worlds. [Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith) 09:11, 21 April 2006 (UTC) - That, indeed, seems to be the most reasonable approach. Perhaps we can elaborate on the differences between quotes on the basic page and quotes on the /Citations subpage. Perhaps the former can serve as a means to attest the word, especially its spelling, and the latter to illustrate usage and give an overall through-time overview of the word, especially its meaning.

In a regular expression a '(' parenthesis is a grouping symbol, if you want the literal symbol you need to 'escape' it by putting a special character, an escape code (which need not be chr27, backslash is common) in front of it.

Furthermore I have read that Rolls-Royce vigorously enforces this trademark to the point of insisting that it be used only as an adjective. Company literature and employees will never say anything other than \"Rolls-Royce motor car\" etc. We don't even have a adjective sense here. How to deal with trademarks has come up before. Last time I checked a few dictionaries and many acutally label such entries simply \"trademark\" rather than any part-of-speech. \u2014 [Hippietrail](/wiki/User:Hippietrail) 17:13, 23 April 2006 (UTC) - What company literature and employees say is beside the point, as \"Rolls-Royce\" is almost exclusively a noun in everyday use. It should certainly be marked as a trademark, but the part of speech must be \"Noun\", whatever the company might say. Incidentally, in \"Rolls-Royce motor car\", \"Rolls-Royce\" is still a noun (it is a modifier), not an adjective. Compare \"car showroom\" - here \"car\" is still a noun, not an adjective. - I know that companies enforce this by law (for example, according to [the Lego company's page about their trademarks on websites](http://www.lego.com/eng/info/?page=fairplay), \"...LEGO [...] should always be used as an adjective, not as a noun [...] Never say 'MODELS BUILT OF LEGOs'\" and should be all in capital letters) but this is not how these terms are commonly used. Wiktionary must reflect actual usage, not company policy. Of course, we can alway refer to company policy in the \"Usage notes\" section and refer the user to the relevant page. \u2014 [Paul G](/wiki/User:Paul_G)16:25, 24 April 2006 (UTC) - Oh I forgot to mention, the reason companies do this is because only adjectives can be trademarked, nouns cannot. This would at least suggest that at the time of trademarking these words were in fact only adjectives and only later did regular people turn them into other parts of speech. This may be why so many dictionaries never mark trademarks as any part of speech. \u2014 [Hippietrail](/wiki/User:Hippietrail)16:40, 24 April 2006 (UTC) - Oh I forgot to mention, the reason companies do this is because only adjectives can be trademarked, nouns cannot.

In fact I've read the courts only care that they make some effort to ensure the preservation of the trademark. As with Transcription of the word \"Wiktionary\" Unless, of course, one is going for only the British pronunciation of \"Wiktionary,\" one should be sure to include the SAE transcription of the word, with the IPA epsilon between the \"n\" and the \"r.\" In addition, for IPA purposes, the final I in the word should be lower case, as it is the tense form.

Sunny. - If you are referring to the image at the top lefthand corner of the page, then yes, this has come up many times before. This is just one UK pronunciation. When you say \"epsilon\", do you mean // or [schwa](/wiki/schwa)(//), the vowel in the first and second syllables of \"second\", respectively?

According to Hermann Giliomee's book, \"The Afrikaners: Biography of a People\" (University of Virginia Press/Tafelberg Publishers, 2003.) the first printed use of the term in its modern sense dates back to 1929. He writes (p 454): - The first printed record of the term 'apartheid', used in its modem sense, dates back to 1929. In addressing a conference of the Free State Dutch Reformed Church (DRC) on missionary work, held in the town of Kroonstad, the Rev.Jan Christoffel du Plessis said: 'In the fundamental idea of our missionary work and not in racial prejudice one must seek an explanation for the spirit of apartheid that has always characterized our [the DRCs] conduct.' He rejected a missions policy that offered blacks no 'independent national future.' - By 'apartheid' Du Plessis meant that the Gospel had to be taught in a way that strengthened the African 'character, nature and nationality' - in other words, the volkseie (the people's own). Africans had to be uplifted 'on their own terrain, separate and apart.' Blacks and whites had to worship separately to 'ensure the survival of a handful of [Afrikaner] people cut off from their national ties in Europe.' For Du Plessis it was not so much a matter of protecting privilege or exclusivity than finding a policy that concentrated on the eie, or that which was one's own, and which promoted what he called the selfsyn, or being oneself. Implicit in this was the view that only identification with one's own ethnic community was authentic. Du Plessis envisaged the development of autonomous, self-governing black churches as a counter to English missionaries, who tried to produce converts by copying 'Western civilization and religion.' \u2014 [HeervanMalpertuis](/w/index.php?title=User:HeervanMalpertuis&action=edit&redlink=1)22:17, 1 September 2006 (UTC) - By 'apartheid' Du Plessis meant that the Gospel had to be taught in a way that strengthened the African 'character, nature and nationality' - in other words, the volkseie (the people's own).

Yes, \"to add a decorative border to a painting or photograph\" is a special case of \"to position visually within a fixed boundary\", so it's an open question how to handle these. The problem is it might also be considered a special case of \"to put together the structural elements\", but the examples of making houses and movies would be too broadly brushed under one definition. - The example of framing the question is a poor one under the definition \"to construct in words\", that is, to [phrase](/wiki/phrase). To [frame the question](/w/index.php?title=frame_the_question&action=edit&redlink=1)means \"to establish the context for understanding or interpretation\". However, I'm not so sure that [frame](/wiki/frame)and [phrase](/wiki/phrase)are synonymous except figuratively. In other words, \"to construct in words\" may not be the ideal definition to use. - That comes out to as few as four and as many as the existing six definitions, depending.

Framing a painting is a [carpentry](/wiki/carpentry)issue, involving a choice of texture, color, and whether or not to place protective glass within the picture frame. Given the vast difference between tools and procedures, as well as the result, I would keep the two senses separate. They are likely to be different in other languages. -- [EncycloPetey](/wiki/User:EncycloPetey)17:26, 7 May 2006 (UTC) Sense 5 (establish a context for) is a misunderstanding as far as I'm concerned. You can frame an argument, a question, an apology etc....the sense is of putting it together, coming up with, shaping. OED gives this sense as 'devise, compose, conceive'. [Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith) 17:34, 7 May 2006 (UTC) - But constructing an argument in words, or devising, composing, conceiving an argument, isn't the same as framing essentially the discussion of the arguments. The first just means phrasing a simple question etc., as participation in a discussion or what have you. The latter means establishing the way in which something is viewed in the first place, e.g. the merits by which the arguments of a discussion are weighed. There would be a difference, for instance, in asking, \"Can these definitions be safely combined?\", and \"Would it be beneficial to combine these definitions?\" The focus is either on the language or the users. The first also implies that the definitions should be combined if they can be. If that aspect were overlooked, then Connel, had he originally written the question that way, would have successfully framed not just his own question, but the entire debate. Now Connel may have a lot of weight here, but I doubt it's that supreme. The media, on the other hand, does have the power, collectively, to frame public discourse, just in its selection of which stories are newsworthy, or in the way it analyzes a problem, even if the opinions themselves are balanced. Hence the less liberal the media, the more it can be employed as an instrument of control. That's a bit of a stretch from \"choice of words\".

I don't completely agree here, as most [suffixes](/wiki/Category:English_suffixes) have their derivations listed on the page itself. For [-ize](/wiki/-ize), that would be overkill, which is why I moved it to a subpage. However, it's not a bad idea to have them in an Appendix - arguably it's even a better idea - but then we should do the same for all such derivations. Open to interpretation is a) whether they belong in any Derived/Related terms section, and b) how useful they are for the average user looking up an entry. Therefore, concentrating such lists in an Appendix section is perhaps worth considering.

There must be at least a couple of applications where it would be useful to have an Appendix:List of probably a third to a quarter of the verbs in the English language. - On the other hand, I would find a list of words ending in \"ize\" that didn't derive from the suffix to be somewhat more intersting.

[Pants](/wiki/pants), the clothing, I understand to be different from [pant](/wiki/pant), the material, but are [wheels](/wiki/wheels) different from a [wheel](/wiki/wheel), [rocks](/wiki/rocks) from a [rock](/wiki/rock), 15:43, 12 May 2006 (UTC) - Pluralia tantum would be words with senses that only appear in the plural (and that wouldn't be expected from the singular). Latin (where the term originated) had the same dilemma, e.g. with [littera](/wiki/littera)'letter, [letteral](/wiki/letteral)', and its plural ' [litterae](/wiki/litterae)' also meaning 'letter, [epistle](/wiki/epistle).' I should mark as plurale tantum any sense of 'Xes' that do all of the following: - The sense does not apply when used in the singular. Ex. [jeans](/wiki/jeans)are an article of clothing, but [jean](/wiki/jean)is not. - If the word has a singular form X, the sense does not have the literal meaning of 'many or all Xes.' Ex. [wheels](/wiki/wheels)'car' does not mean or 'all wheels' or even (arguably) 'four wheels.' - If the item denoted can conceivably represent a group of objects, the sense has not yet produced a singular in the standard language by [back-formation](/wiki/back-formation). Ex. [scissor](/wiki/scissor)'one blade of a pair of scissors,' which (I think) is still somewhat informal, but if it were to become standard, [scissors](/wiki/scissors)could no longer be marked plurale tantum. - The sense takes plural agreement\u2014that is, it has to be grammatically plural, not just plural in form. Ex. [Athens](/wiki/Athens), whose -s is a plural marker (the name being plural in ancient Greek and Latin), no longer construes as a plural noun; on the other hand, [trousers](/wiki/trousers)takes a plural verb. - The sense does not apply when used in the singular. Ex. - A 'new' plurale tantum is probably going to have a sense something like 'a particular kind of group of Xes or X-like objects, or its related apparatus.' (I should think [rocks](/wiki/rocks)'testicles' and [wheels](/wiki/wheels)'car' fall under this.) \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)01:20, 14 May 2006 (UTC) Hmm, well sense 3 is the most important one here for me. No one would look up [scissor](/wiki/scissor). But you might look up [rock](/wiki/rock) to understand an idiomatic use of [rocks](/wiki/rocks).

[Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith) 09:17, 14 May 2006 (UTC) - Ah. Well, without a coherent policy on what deserves entries and what doesn't, I'm sure the question remains open. Personally with the singulars [rock](/wiki/rock)and [wheel](/wiki/wheel)existing, I wouldn't give [rocks](/wiki/rocks)and [wheels](/wiki/wheels)anything that could be mistaken for entries at all (cf.). But that doesn't happen on en: :p \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)22:18, 14 May 2006 (UTC) And what about words that are usually but not always plural?

[Davilla](/wiki/User:Davilla) 18:49, 15 May 2006 (UTC) - When I made that error, I don't think we had as clear a recommendation on what a plural entry should look like - we certainly didn't have this category yet.

Disputed names for [polygons](/wiki/polygon) with large numbers of sides Wikipedia has a number of (very short) articles for polygons with large numbers of sides.

For example, [chiliagon](/wiki/chiliagon) features in some other dictionaries, but this term would never be used in mathematics. For polygons with more than about 12 sides, mathematicians tend to use n-gon, where n is the number of sides. So a chiliagon would be referred to as a 1000-gon, for example.

(Someone said last night, lamenting the poor grammar of the world, that dictionaries were only beginning to include this sense, does it need a usage note?) But that leads to the second sense of that POS: one [plus](/wiki/plus) one is two Is that really using [plus](/wiki/plus) as a conjunction? And if it is a conjunction should it be is two or are two? [RJFJR](/wiki/User:RJFJR) 15:52, 22 May 2006 (UTC) - Using [plus](/wiki/plus)as a conjunction = [and](/wiki/and)is fairly common, especially in the States and not really considered colloquial any more. It is in quite a few dictionaries, my sOED and Collins both have it. As for 'one plus one equals two', [plus](/wiki/plus)functions there as a preposition. The grammatical number of the verb varies and I don't believe one is more correct than the other. [Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith)16:50, 22 May 2006 (UTC) - Edit: I see that the [plus](/wiki/plus)article doesn't have a preposition section. The page needs some cleanup. [Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith)16:53, 22 May 2006 (UTC) - I was always under the impression that terms for mathematical functions like \" [plus](/wiki/plus)\" (a reading for \" [+](/wiki/%2B)\", the symbol for the [addition](/wiki/addition)function), \" [times](/wiki/times)\" (a reading for \" [\u00d7](/wiki/%C3%97)\", the symbol for the [multiplication](/wiki/multiplication)function), and \" [xor](/wiki/xor)\" (a reading for \" [](/wiki/%E2%8A%95)\", the symbol for the [disjoint union](/wiki/disjoint_union)function) can be used in two ways: (a) as a reading of the corresponding symbol in a mathematical equation or (b) as a conjunction in a traditional English sentence that is similar in meaning to a mathematical equation. When used as the reading of the corresponding symbol in a mathematical equation, the reading of \" [=](/wiki/%3D)\" is \"equals\" or \"is\". When reading the terms as conjunctions, the standard rules for subject-verb agreement apply. [Rod](/wiki/User:Rodasmith)( [A. Smith](/wiki/User_talk:Rodasmith)) 21:03, 22 May 2006 (UTC) - Well, if I knew nothing about English grammar, I would guess it's a coverb in this use rather than any of the others. But that's kind of a radical opinion, especially considering that it isn't a verb in the first place! But consider \"modulo\" which is a preposition in \"18 (mod 3)\" and more of an actor (verbesque) in \"int i=8%3\". [Davilla](/wiki/User:Davilla)20:33, 25 May 2006 (UTC) - As to numbers as they pertain to the \"number\" of the verb, these generally take is. Must have read this in AHD but I can't find it at the moment. I'd guess you're right about the use as a conjunction.

Yes, I think you're right - but you make it sound as though the maths symbols predate the words! In fact [plus](/wiki/plus) was used in this way (prepositionally) long before [+](/wiki/%2B) became commonly used....the standard abbreviation before that was [P](/wiki/P). [Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith) 21:09, 22 May 2006 (UTC) - Actually, AHD seems to be in the minority here. All the other dictionaries give the most common senses as preposition which is what I thought, at least one gives no conjunction senses but most give it for the sense that means and.

[Davilla](/wiki/User:Davilla)16:46, 26 May 2006 (UTC) - So moved. I see a \"POS\" heading has been added, [infix](/wiki/infix), but the definition of that term specifically mentions added [morphemes](/wiki/morpheme). This is actually a fixed grammatical formula consisting of multiple words, nothing to do with morphemes. I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't have a POS as we generally think of them - the best I can think of is [particle](/wiki/particle) but I'm not sure if particles can consist of multiple terms. Collins and Encarta agree that an infix is a type of [affix](/wiki/affix), not a type of word or phrase. Though particle may or may not be correct, it's surely not as wrong as infix so I'm going ahead and changing it but please continue discussion here. BTW, I'm more and more forming an opinion that much of our format, including POS is too rigid and will need to be improved sooner or later. \u2014 [Hippietrail](/wiki/User:Hippietrail) 17:24, 23 May 2006 (UTC) - My, that sounds ominous. -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie) [T](/wiki/User_talk:Connel_MacKenzie) [C](/wiki/Special:Contributions/Connel_MacKenzie)20:03, 23 May 2006 (UTC) - Basically I think we need to re-think our heading structure and adopt something more like what real dictionaries use. They don't use POS as a heading but rather as a marker at the sense level. If we do that we can make POS optional or much deemphasize it at least. We'd be better off with a structure that indicates what an entry is in relation to Wiktionary rather than in relation to a language.

However in Guatemala they are common but they are general stores as the Mexico def here says. They are also general stores in El Salvador and Honduras but I haven't seen any in Nicaragua or Costa Rica at all. In all countries I know a hardware store is always a [ferreter\u00eda](/wiki/ferreter%C3%ADa) and never an [abarroter\u00eda](/wiki/abarroter%C3%ADa). \u2014 [Hippietrail](/wiki/User:Hippietrail) 19:23, 23 May 2006 (UTC) - Hmm, well I put the regional tags on here as given in my Collins.

I think that What's the English for... uses grammatical [ellipsis](/wiki/ellipsis) of the word term, phrase or expression, i.e. that it's short for What's the English term for.... However, I notice that our own entry for [ellipsis](/wiki/ellipsis) as of yet lacks the grammatical sense (which I'll add in a minute) and \" [English](/wiki/English)\" shows \"the English-language term or expression for something\" as a subsense of \"with reference to the language\", implying that there is no in such phrases. Thoughts? [Rod](/wiki/User:Rodasmith) ( [A. Smith](/wiki/User_talk:Rodasmith)) 01:39, May 2006 (UTC) - Well, it depends...you could parse the sentence as having grammatical ellipsis of a noun, but equally you could see [English](/wiki/English)as a noun in itself, having in this case a specific sense. This is really just an example of the very common process by which adjectives become used substantively, e.g. 'three of the wounded [people] later died', 'which is the biggest [one]?' etc etc. Once this starts happening it isn't really usual to talk about grammatical ellipsis; you wouldn't expect a Usage Note to say that 'an American' means originally 'an American [person]', for instance. [Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith)06:50, 26 May 2006 (UTC) Does anyone know the difference between an absolute superlative and an elative? And which european languages have which? I have two greek grammars (one english and on danish) that contradict each other concerning what the greek fourth grade is.

The [Absolute superlative](/w/index.php?title=Absolute_superlative&action=edit&redlink=1) side states that Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan has an absolute superlative form, but is this the same as the greek absolute superlative, if we accept it as such?

By contrast, English common nouns are only capitalized only when other capitalization rules apply.

I still maintain that the names for days of the week and names for months are proper nouns in English. - Note that proper nouns can often function as common nouns, e.g. \"John\" in \"John is taller than Jane\" functions as a proper noun because it names a particular entity. \"John\" in \"My class has two Johns and one Jane\" functions as a common noun because it identifies members of a group of entities who have the name \"John\", and we can say \"the John\" or \"a John\". Similarly, \"June\" in \"The weather is nice in June\" functions as a proper noun because it names a year-independent abstract entity, but \"June\" in \"the June before last\" and in \"each June we travel to...\" functions as a common noun because it refers to one of several year-specific months that have the name \"June\".

Same for \"John\" : when you say \"My class has two Johns\", you mean \"My class has two persons called Johns\" : Johns is still a proper noun, although it is used as a common noun here. So, if we want to compare them we have to get rid of any rhetorical things. (note that you can also substitute a proper noun by a proper noun : You are Mozart). - As for the distinction... I suppose that the difference is that common nouns have a definition that describes there meanings, so the meanings can be translated, whereas the definition of proper nouns only describes the \"unique entity\" they name, and then we can't translate them unless the name for that \"unique entity\" exist in the other languages, (or if we translitterate them). - [Dakdada](/wiki/User:Darkdadaah)14:36, 16 June 2006 (UTC) - Anyway thanks for the answers (and sorry for bothering you with that matter ^^). - [Dakdada](/wiki/User:Darkdadaah)14:36, 16 June 2006 (UTC) - Hm this is - Note that proper nouns can often function as common nouns, e.g. \"John\" in \"John is taller than Jane\" functions as a proper noun because it names a particular entity. \"John\" in \"My class has two Johns and one Jane\" functions as a common noun because it identifies members of a group of entities who have the name \"John\", and we can say \"the John\" or \"a John\".

For one, the simplified entries each have one extra step in their \"etymology\". For another, the two entries should have distinct (but probably templatable(?)) usage notes since each version is appropriate only in certain contexts. [Rod](/wiki/User:Rodasmith)( [A.

If you look at my entries (of which this is one), you will see that I go back and forth on this issue. Philosophically, I agree with separate entries. In practical terms, redirects are just plain faster. Remember, we're talking computers! People won't want to use software that is overly cumbersome (unless they are diehards like me). I think templates are an interesting idea, and may just be the solution for English. Chinese simply has too much variation to make templates a viable option on a large scale. It's much easier and faster to create a separate entry for each word than to create THOUSANDS of templates (which is what would be required for Chinese) in addition to the entries themselves. In other words, we must come up with an easy-to-implement solution that allows the user to input all required information with a minimum amount of hassle. As a contributor, I shouldn't have to be spending this much time debating about the LOOK of the entry; I should be more worried about the accuracy and completeness of the information contained in the entry. In my opinion, the LOOK of the page (including whether to display in simplified or traditional should be incorporated into the preferences settings).

What does everyone else think? - But it is not 'ultra-correct' to to use plurals from a word's language of origin; in fact usually it's just wrong. Since no English dictionaries list these forms, and they are virtually unattested in English, you really have no authority to claim that they are correct. The grammatical rules of other languages are just not relevant. Most English words are from Old English, which formed plurals by adding not -s but -as; are you going to adopt that as well? One dog, two doggas? Anyway, how far back do you go? And why stop with plural inflections; why not adopt subjunctive cases as well when the mood requires it? Or resurrect the dual form when talking about two things? These attempts to be 'correct' are misguided. They ignore the fact that English has a grammar of its own which is more than capable of forming plurals in its own regular way without being in any way 'wrong'. Yes, sometimes people use these forms out of error rather than choice, but that doesn't mean that there is some 'pure' form of inflections for every word that can be found if you just go back a language or two. I agree that the information should be available on Wiktionary, but the proper place for it is usually within the relevant source-language section rather than in the English (unless it has been attested in English).

Since no English dictionaries list these forms, and they are virtually unattested in English, you really have no authority to claim that they are correct. The grammatical rules of other languages are just not relevant. Most English words are from Old English, which formed plurals by adding not -s but -as; are you going to adopt that as well? One dog, two doggas? Anyway, how far back do you go? And why stop with plural inflections; why not adopt subjunctive cases as well when the mood requires it? Or resurrect the dual form when talking about two things? These attempts to be 'correct' are misguided. They ignore the fact that English has a grammar of its own which is more than capable of forming plurals in its own regular way without being in any way 'wrong'. Yes, sometimes people use these forms out of error rather than choice, but that doesn't mean that there is some 'pure' form of inflections for every word that can be found if you just go back a language or two. I agree that the information should be available on Wiktionary, but the proper place for it is usually within the relevant source-language section rather than in the English (unless it has been attested in English). Quite apart from anything else, there is also the consideration of register: platypodes really sounds very pretentious.

What's the difference between a committed relationship and going steady? -- [Creidieki](/wiki/User:Creidieki)05:07, 12 July 2006 (UTC) - A [committed](/wiki/committed)relationship implies a commitment to stay together of some sort, while [going steady](/wiki/going_steady)is more tentative, where the couple is happily together, but with no assurance from each other regarding long term plans. The \"between two sexes\" I assume is meant to convey that plutonic relationships can also qualify as [going steady](/wiki/going_steady)(but actually, I'm not certain that definition is correct.)

[Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith)08:49, 14 July 2006 (UTC) I came to Wiktionary (which I found very recently), to find out if I should spell a word \"orchestrator\" or \"orchestrater.\" I don't know the protocol for adding a word. (is it customary to avoid adding every possible suffix or prefix?) (if I were to add this word, should I try to add it to an existing page (orchestra or orchestrate?) I'm not invested in adding a word. I just want to be helpful (and find out how to spell the word). I would be happy for someone else to figure out the right spelling and, if it would be appropriate, add the word to Wiktionary. - It should be orchestrator. The general rule I was taught, in the UK, is that where the action is performed by a person, -or is used, and when by a thing, -er is used. I've no idea why, but I have found very few exceptions. However, since the exceptions tend to come from the US, the rule may not be so foolproof there. -- [Enginear](/wiki/User:Enginear)21:25, 13 July 2006 (UTC) There isn't really any logic to it. [-er](/wiki/-er) is the native suffix (i.e. it comes from Old English [-ere](/wiki/-ere)), so it's more likely to be added on to native words, e.g. [lover](/wiki/lover), [driver](/wiki/driver), [maker](/wiki/maker) etc. Whereas, [-or](/wiki/-or) came to us through French from Latin, so it's more likely to be on Latinate words, e.g. [doctor](/wiki/doctor), [governor](/wiki/governor), [orchestrator](/wiki/orchestrator) etc. However, there are very many exceptions. [Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith) 08:46, 14 July 2006 (UTC) - Thanks for that -- I suppose I should have looked up our articles on the suffices myself. But they suggest there is a partial logic, at least re the \"more difficult\" (to a schoolchild) longer French/Latin words, in that -or is only used in Latin where a person is the agent, and apparently English tends to follow Latin usage, hence computor (in UK, not yet an entry) for a person who counts, and computer for a thing. [Computer](/wiki/Computer)suggests that it can also be used for a person, but I have never noticed that. Have you? Since non-automated counting is rather out of fashion these days, your field of reading is probably more appropriate than mine! The exception I notice most often is compressor. Neal Stephenson uses the spelling \"computer\" to refer to persons who do mathematical computations in his BAROQUE CYCLE novels. The phonetic spelling of Wiktionary I am a beginning linguistics student and I happened to notice the phonetic spelling of Wiktionary in the icon on the opening page. If asked to do this word for an assignment, I would have put an epsilon after the \"n\" and replaced the \"I\" with an \"i\". Correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks, Craig - It depends where you're from. The icon represents [Received Pronunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation), and we have actually discussed this topic many times before in the Beer Parlour, since RP is not really in use any more. Most people in the UK would say /wkni/; sometimes there will be another vowel between the N and the R, as you suggest. In different parts of the US it will be different again. If you want more info, have a look through the Beer Parlour archives, where this has been discussed ad nauseam.

I firmly believe in the dictum \"no original work\" but nonetheless, I wonder if I detect a second etymology, that regarding 'bits taken from other sources', as with notes or a crib sheet, specifically, possibly related to scribe/scrive, with 'scrive' being the join between the two: [carpenters](/wiki/carpenter) routinely [scrive](/wiki/scrive) lines. When you look at the majority of the defs, they all ultimately refer to a roughly constructed boxy wooden thing (with the exception of the finished bit of US furniture for a baby). This would be an 'influenced by' 2nd etymology. I do not plan on posting this in the etymology, but will hint of it (at least by the arrangement of defs), but did write Michael Quinion on the subject; he may or may not reply.

I think you have to be a bit careful of including a note on the =Etymology= line saying what you think the 'overall sense' is, because it gives the impression that the word has some inherent root meaning, whereas in fact the definitions have usually developed independently from one another, and do not spring from any historic 'true' meaning (in OE the word was used exclusively for animals' feeding troughs, and Jesus's manger). So I think decisions about 'overall meaning' are best left to the reader's own judgements. But great work with the rest of the article - pics are fab - some example sentences for all the senses would be a desirable next step.

I would also remind Hippietrail et al that people look to dictionaries quite legitimately for information about how to resolve disputes like this, something which has nothing to do with remaining 'ignorant of how the common people speak'. In this case it is NPOV to call the word 'acceptable', particularly since for many people it's the opposite.

I doubt that many would argue that to precede the words [alcohol](/wiki/alcohol), [algebra](/wiki/algebra)or [alkali](/wiki/alkali)with the definite article would create a redundancy; however, a great many would argue that the 'the' in \"The [Alhambra](/wiki/Alhambra)\" is redundant. However, [hoi polloi](/wiki/hoi_polloi)is different from the above four examples. If it was written 'hoipolloi', or even 'hoi-polloi', then to precede it with 'the' would be grammatical; however, as it is a two-word noun phrase, I would consider \"the hoi polloi\" to be redundant.

Someone has wikified them again, justifying this by saying \"component words are wikified no matter whether or not there are English entires [sic] for them since wiki links do not take language into account and surprising things may appear there at any time\". - While it is true that Wiktionary links do not take language into account, I would expect, on clicking on the component words of a phrase used in a particular language, to find out more about those component words in that language. The user clicking on \"hoi\" and expecting to find out more information about this supposedly English word gets Finnish and Pirah\u00e3 entries, and gets nothing at all if clicking on \"polloi\". \"Hoi\" is also an English word (an interjection used to attract attention) even though we do not yet have an entry for it, but this is utterly unrelated to \"hoi polloi\" and so that phrase should certainly not link to it. - The justification given for wikifying the component words of \"hoi polloi\" is therefore fallacious, and so I have dewikified them again. - Anyone wanting to claim that \"hoi\" and \"polloi\" are Ancient Greek words and so can be wikified might like to try finding them in a dictionary of Ancient Greek before making such claim.\u2014 [Paul G](/wiki/User:Paul_G)19:55, 22 July 2006 (UTC) - Anyone wanting to claim that \"hoi\" and \"polloi\" are Ancient Greek words and so can be wikified might like to try finding them in a dictionary of Ancient Greek before making such claim.\u2014 - It was me who rewikified them.

So [blasted](/wiki/blasted), as the past participle, can mean any of these things. But to me 'blasted pine' means basically withered, with undertones of being slightly creepy and diseased. The word has carried quite a lot of connotations ever since Shakespeare used it in King Lear, where the famous 'blasted heath' is a place of chaos and madness, windswept and inhuman. London would probably have had Lear in mind. [Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith) 07:46, 23 July 2006 (UTC) - To me, perhaps less poetically, it just speaks literally, blasted by gales or hurricanes, and reminds me of trees, as many in Cornwall or the west coast of Scotland, which appear to have a permanent bend away from the wind, with all the branches being on the leeward side. (This is because leaves on the side of the prevailing wind quickly dry up in the strong winds, particularly if there is some salt spray. The trees then concentrate on developing those branches which \"bear fruit\".) -- [Enginear](/wiki/User:Enginear)14:12, 30 July 2006 (UTC) - For me it has connotations of being struck by lightning and then regrowing. A blasted oak would be dead in some parts and live in others. Alternatively, a blasted moor would be scrubby and rock strewn, but not necessarily diseased, although it might be. I cant think that one would talk of a blasted swamp or a blasted apple orchard to imply disease only. If trees were bent over (as they are in Cape Town aswell), then I would call them wind-blasted and not blasted on their own.

While not explicitly about words, Stephen Fry loves to toss in etymologies where these are of interest. Last night's episode contained a beauty, and I wonder if there is any truth to it. I saw the programme first time round but forgot to post about it here. Supposedly, [Hornby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornby_Railways) (if I remember correctly) used to produce their models in two box formats: \"box standard\" for the ordinary model and \"box deluxe\" for the higher-quality model. Supposedly (again), these are the origins of, respectively, [bog standard](/wiki/bog_standard) (by corruption) and [the dog's these meaning, respectively, \"ordinary\" and \"excellent\". It would be wonderful if these were true. Does anyone know if they are? While on the subject of British television programmes, the OED recently asked the public to help [antedate](/wiki/antedate) certain words and phrases, and made a TV series out of it called Balderdash and Piffle \"Bog standard\" was one of the phrases they asked for help with, and \"box-standard\" does indeed appear in the etymology for [OED's entry for this word](http://www.oed.com/bbcwords/bogstandard-new.html%7Cthe), so it might well be true. \"The dog's bollocks\" could just be another one in the long list of things belonging to animals that are used for things that are considered to be very good not etymologically related).

I wrote to them, many years ago, pointing out that by the early 70s the phrase bog standard was in use in the motor car tuning trade, and suggested that was a corruption. I suspect I was not alone, and after a while they noted this on their website. - However, since [Hornby trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornby_Railways)have been produced since 1920, there is a significant chance that they could have produced box standard sets long before the motor-bike usage -- indeed the move from children's toys to \"big boys' toys\" seems appropriate.

You should know by now that Wiktionary is not here to 'prevent the corruption of language', a concept which is to all intents and purposes utterly meaningless. I'm sure people were complaining a thousand years ago when English lost grammatical gender and a case system, but it didn't stop Shakespeare writing some decent enough poetry a few centuries later. Attempting to rollback linguistic changes which you think are 'bad' is futile and misguided; you might wish to make 'value judgements' about which changes are good and which bad, but that is not the job of a serious dictionary, which is there simply to record and document changes. If language was regulated by committee then maybe you would have a point, and we would have to expunge homonyms from English altogether to reduce ambiguity and aid the 'actualisation of language' - but that is not the way things work.

In words such as [deism](/wiki/deism), [deist](/wiki/deist), [pandeism](/wiki/pandeism), [panendeism](/wiki/panendeism), etc., should the \"e\" be pronounced like a long \"a\" - my research indicates that \" [deus](/wiki/deus)\", which is the root for all of these, is pronounced like DAY-us, and that these words should be pronounced like DAY-ism, DAY-ist, pan-DAY-ism, pan-en-DAY-ism, etc. [Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/deism) offers the long \"e\" and long \"a\" as alternate possibilities, but I believe only the long \"a\" should be considered correct based on the root (contra [theism](/wiki/theism) and variations, derived from [](/wiki/%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%8C%CF%82), pronounced \"THEE-os\"). [bd2412](/wiki/User:BD2412) [T](/wiki/User_talk:BD2412) 22:43, 30 July 2006 (UTC) - Either /e/ or /i:/ is fine for this vowel. You're right that the /e/ is closer to the Latin, but still not exactly the same - Latin used the 'pure' /e/, so deus = /deus/. I'm not sure what your point about Greek is - the e-vowel sound there was identical ( = Classical /teos/). I'm not sure why we have developed two pronunciations, but they're certainly both well-established and both pretty common in my experience. [Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith)08:42, 31 July 2006 (UTC) - I was under the impression that was pronounced with a long \"e\". My point was that many people, I think, pronounce deism as though it rhymes with theism, deist as though it rhymes with theist, pandeist as though it rhymes with pantheist, and so forth, because the words have similar appearances and are within the same realm of study (especially once you get into hair-splitting differences between, e.g. pantheism, panentheism, and panendeism).

I'd argue that these forms are sufficiently naturalised to be considered English. Apart from this, I'm arguing more for consistency, if we have \"polis > poleis\" and \"megalopolis > megalopoleis\", then we ought to have \"metropolis > metropoleis\" \u2014 in the same way that if we have \"pous > podes\" and \"octopus (from oktopous) > octopodes\", then we ought to have \"platypus > platypodes\". - Oh, and you said you wanted the name of a segment of British society which uses metropoleis.

Shall Wiktionary become the next great battlefield of [w:Helena Kobrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Kobrin)? - The Book of Mormon was first published in 1830. It's 1830's English. Removing the date is offensive. Shall 1611 be omitted in any reference to the [KJV](/wiki/KJV)? - Removing the authorial attribution to Joseph Smith is as offensive as removing the authorial attribution to [Isaiah](/wiki/Isaiah)or [Micah](/wiki/Micah)in the bible. - Any suggestion that it is divinely inspired is as offensive as suggesting the bible is divinely inspired (it's called 'scripture' in the history). - The Bible is an old old old book, with a standardized name and a standardized citation apparatus, just like the Shakespeare corpus, just as is the Koran. The Book of Mormon, like MaryBakerEddy's book and L. Ron's books, are johnny-come-lately and lack any historical basis for being treated as anything other than just another book. - Shall we bring in [w:Emanuel Swedenborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Swedenborg)'s writings, and shall they be considered all of the writings these be accorded the same dignity as the [KJV](/wiki/KJV)? - Suggested rule. Unless it was in wide circulation by 1611 (to include subsequent English versions), it's treated as a regular everyday book. We might chose an earlier date, actually.-- [Allamakee Democrat](/wiki/User:Allamakee_Democrat)09:56, 12 August 2006 (UTC) - I'm just arguing the other side as a way to explore the question. For a start, 1611 seems highly arbitrary. There are numerous alternative translations to the KJV that were produced later, by people seeking to improve on the wording/translation/usage, which presumably have methods of reference. Any book could be assigned a system of citation. (question, do any of James Joyce's novels have a scholarly method of reference?) Hopefully NPOV will keep this from becoming a battlefield. [RJFJR](/wiki/User:RJFJR)12:41, 12 August 2006 (UTC) - We are talking about how Holy Scripture is to be quoted. Unless we are to give equal ground to the Book of Mormon, or Mary Baker Eddy's Keys..., et al., we need an absolute cutoff date. 1611 is convenient, as this is the date of the standard citable edition of the bible (Wycliffe's New Testament is earlier, along with the Geneva Bible, et al.). It's unlikely that the Analects of Confucius will get quoted this way, but they could. I suggest that the Rig Veda can be quoted a la the bible, but this too is unlikely, in that they have their own learned textual apparatus in English for quotation. My article was polite. How does one deal with johnny-come-lately divine revelation.?-- [Allamakee Democrat](/wiki/User:Allamakee_Democrat)12:57, 12 August 2006 (UTC) - We are talking about how Holy Scripture is to be quoted.

(Disclaimer: I am not Mormon.) Certainly their texts are considered \"scripture\" to them. I think I saw the edit you are questioning. It looked OK to me then, but perhaps I'm missing something. The contributor gave a reference for the minor changes he was making, that on cursory inspection seemed to be Mormon-sanctioned. Why would we ask for anything more than that? You can just as easily add a note (referenced) that attributes authorship as the original entry did. - I think assigning an arbitrary cutoff date would make it a [NPOV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPOV)issue. Frankly, I'd reather stick to referenced material to avoid that entirely. The question of what type of religion it is, is certainly a different question that would invoke ridiculous long-term NPOV disputes. I've previously learned that the hard way; please let's avoid that, by sticking to referenced material. -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie)17:52, 13 August 2006 (UTC) - Cut-off dates are arbitrary and there's no need. Go ahead and treat it as a work of scipture. After all, it wouldn't be a bestseller on its own merits. - Yes, the date is important as the date that the words first appeared in English, regardless of whether this is truly a translation. However I would insist that the [original text](http://www.saintsalive.com/mormonism/bomchanges.htm)is cited if the 1830 date is given. Otherwise use the date of the revision. [DAVilla](/wiki/User:DAVilla)21:04, 16 August 2006 (UTC) - I don't see that it needs to be treated differently than any other publication for purposes of dates. In terms of date, we're always interested in the date of a particular source in a particular language (even more so for quotations used as examples). The book of Isaiah is demonstrably dated to [BCE](/wiki/BCE), but only in Hebrew and Greek. If I use some English translation, then that translation will have a date that it was published, and that date of the translation should be included with the citation. If I cite a different English translation, I will use a different date. This applies to any published work in translation whether it is the book of Isaiah or Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues under the Sea. Whether we accept the Book of Mormon as divinely inspired and translated from golden tablets or not, we can demonstrate the date when the first English edition appeared, and that is what we cite. If someone would like to use an earlier edition, they will have to be certain that the earlier edition is available for study in a library. -- [EncycloPetey](/wiki/User:EncycloPetey)00:19, 15 November 2006 (UTC) - I don't see that it needs to be treated differently than any other publication for purposes of dates.

Having spent some 17 years researching this concept there are several types of half-truths that are not in any dictionary. Half-truths are types of statements that are deceptive lies. 1. Partly true statement. (standard definition) 2. A statement that is part of the truth. (\u00a9 submitted in 1994) 3. A literal half of a truth, ie 'we are all equal before God', becomes, \"we are all equal'.\u00a9 4. A statement taken out of the correct time continum.\u00a9 5. A word with two or more meanings that is used to distort the actual meaning.\u00a9 6. A truth that is a minor truth. \u00a9 7.

It would be like giving two definitions of \"arm\": 1) \"left upper limb\"; 2) \"right upper limb\". Can anyone write a succinct, single definition of [sister-in-law](/wiki/sister-in-law)? The best I can come up with is \"a woman who would be someone's sister if all marriages were incestuous\". -- [Ptcamn](/w/index.php?title=User:Ptcamn&action=edit&redlink=1) 09:30, 14 August 2006 (UTC) - \"A woman related to a particular person through an intermediate who is the spouse of one and the sibling (or sibling-in-law) of the other.\" \u2014 [Muke Tever](/wiki/User:Muke)11:02, 14 August 2006 (UTC) Er...no. Unlike [arm](/wiki/arm), in this instance it is far more useful to have two separate definitions. It also helps with translations since many languages use separate terms. [Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith) 11:25, 14 August 2006 (UTC) - But other languages may recognize many more categories than English does. For example, some languages distinguish between whether the person the sister-in-law is related to is male or female, or whether the person is older or younger than the other. Are we really going to quadruple the number of definitions to facilitate listing these translations? -- [Ptcamn](/w/index.php?title=User:Ptcamn&action=edit&redlink=1)11:34, 14 August 2006 (UTC) - No, that is just a bonus. The main reason is that it isn't helpful. I don't know of any dictionary which tries to sum these meanings up in one definition. It can probably be done but it's inevitably less clear and hence not very useful. [Widsith](/wiki/User:Widsith)11:40, 14 August 2006 (UTC) - No, that is just a bonus.

But if your brother-in-law is your husband's brother, then that brother-in-law's wife is indeed your sister-in-law.

I don't think we should be promoting \"sister-in-laws\" as being of equal status with the correct plural \"sisters-in-law\". Margaret Mitchell might have put it into the mouths of one of her characters in Gone with the Wind, but that doesn't make it correct. I've deleted this supposed plural but kept the quotation and added a usage note. If we really must include it (as a lot of people do use it ignorantly, and we aim to be descriptive) then it needs to be marked as erroneous (it is the sisters that are plural, not the law). The same would then be required for all other in-laws (except for [in-law](/wiki/in-law) itself, of course). \u2014 [Paul G](/wiki/User:Paul_G) 09:51, 18 August 2006 (UTC) - You use a really strange definition of \"descriptive\". What you're doing here seems to be very much the exact opposite. - \"Sister-in-laws\" should be included in the inflection line, since it's just as real and describable as \"sisters-in-law\". I don't mind if we also include a usage note warning against it, provided it's referenced and put in the mouth of the source, not stated as fact. -- [Ptcamn](/w/index.php?title=User:Ptcamn&action=edit&redlink=1)10:50, 18 August 2006 (UTC) - Well done for pointing out my sophistry :) Does listing \"sister-in-laws\" in the inflection line not give it equal legitimacy with \"sisters-in-law\"? Perhaps there should be a reference to the usage notes there. \u2014 [Paul G](/wiki/User:Paul_G)09:27, 27 August 2006 (UTC) - Well done for pointing out my sophistry :) Does listing \"sister-in-laws\" in the inflection line not give it equal legitimacy with \"sisters-in-law\"? Perhaps there should be a reference to the usage notes there. \u2014 - The usage note was not strong enough in my opinion. \"Considered incorrect by some\" gives too much legitimacy to a plural that is in fact widely considered to be incorect. [The entry at onelook.com](http://onelook.com/?w=sister-in-law&ls=a)gives 18 links. One of these is to Wiktionary. Of the remaining 17 (and it must be borne in mind that some of these are mirrors of others, meaning that some give identical information), nine give \"sisters-in-law\" as the only plural and eight do not give a plural. None (except for Wiktionary as it currently stands) give \"sister-in-laws\" as a valid plural. - The British National Corpus has 31 hits for \"sisters-in-law\" and two for \"sister-in-laws\", while Google print has 11,400 hits and 334 respectively, so there is no denying that \"sister-in-laws\" is sometimes used, and so we can't ignore it entirely. - For the time being at least, I'm confident that pretty much all editors and style guides would insist that \"sister-in-laws\" should be changed to \"sisters-in-law\". I have therefore changed the usage note to \"The plural sister-in-laws is occasionally seen, but this is considered incorrect by most sources; see, for example, (reference).\" I think this wording is an acceptable balance between descriptivism and prescriptivism. \u2014 [Paul G](/wiki/User:Paul_G)09:42, 27 August 2006 (UTC) - For the time being at least, I'm confident that pretty much all editors and style guides would insist that \"sister-in-laws\" should be changed to \"sisters-in-law\".

The usage notes section is for just that, notes on usage \u2014 not for continuing the work of the inflection line because there was some inflected forms we didn't think were legitimate enough for the section inflected forms normally go in. -- [Ptcamn](/w/index.php?title=User:Ptcamn&action=edit&redlink=1)06:07, 28 August 2006 (UTC) - I tend to agree with Paul G. [Sister-in-laws](/wiki/sister-in-law)is usually (but not always) tolerated in casual speech if it is only used a time or two in a conversation, but I do not believe it is ever acceptable in writing. By way of comparison and contrast, the status of [ain't](/wiki/ain%27t)as a solid English word can hardly be denied, but [sister-in-laws](/wiki/sister-in-laws)is always considered a mistake in written English as far as I know. I believe every general English dictionary recognizes [ain't](/wiki/ain%27t), but I have never seen [sister-in-laws](/wiki/sister-in-laws)in print (meaning books, magazines and newspapers, not the Internet), and writing it is just begging for condemnation. Of course, I can only speak for American English ... British English has many divergent dialects and perhaps [sister-in-laws](/wiki/sister-in-laws)is a standard form somewhere or other in the Midlands or remote estuaries. [\u2014Stephen](/wiki/User:Stephen_G._Brown)20:06, 28 August 2006 (UTC) - I tend to agree with Paul G. - No, if a source doesn't talk about it at all, it's because it's unacceptable.

According to Wiktionary this is a British spelling. This is not the case. The preferred spelling in both British and American English is \" [focusing](/wiki/focusing)\". The OED has allowed the doubling of the S as a variant only very recently, and this only because the misspelling had become so common. I'm new to Wiktionary so I'm not sure how best to flag this.

The way to do this is simply via an =Alternative spellings= heading. Wiktionary does not pass judgement on which is more correct, since both are well-attested and attestation is out guiding principle (they are also both found in dictionaries). Labelling [focussing](/wiki/focussing)as British is not to suggest that it is the only spelling used in Britain, only that it is rarely found outside British use.

[DAVilla](/wiki/User:DAVilla) 02:41, 25 August 2006 (UTC) - I can't definitively answer that they were considered planets, since I don't have a copy of Galileo's book in Italian. (By the way, he named them after his patrons, the Medici; the names have since changed.) I have heard from time to time that they were considered planets, though, because they did not follow the movement of the stars.

I became curious about the translation, because I had never before come across the Min Nan expression in question. As it turns out, the translation was based on a (nearly obsolete) Min Nan borrowing from Japanese. A person on Min Nan wikipedia decided to use the term when translating the word [dwarf planet](/wiki/dwarf_planet) into Min Nan. That translation was then copied over to the [dwarf planet](/wiki/dwarf_planet) page. Please see [Talk:dwarf planet](/wiki/Talk:dwarf_planet) for more details. I'm curious if there is any reaction from the English Wiktionary contributors about using translations which are based on nearly obsolete words, when no true modern word exists. I'm a little hesitant about the idea myself, but I am also aware that people who speak less common languages will sometimes try to coin new words (or reuse old ones) as a way to promote the continued use of that language. If this is the case, I don't want to be discouraging of that practice. However, I'm not sure about the best way to handle such a situation. Any advice would be appreciated. [A-cai](/wiki/User:A-cai) 12:47, 28 August 2006 (UTC) - I think it's useful to include difficult terms in lesser known languages such as Min Nan because it will eventually catch the eye of an educated native speaker. Then if the native speaker disagrees with the term, he will feel duty-bound to correct it or amend it in some way. But if we don't put any Min Nan version of [dwarf planet](/wiki/dwarf_planet)at all, then it will not occur to any Min Nan readers add it in. I think the words and phrases that garner the most attention from the public are those that are wrong or not used for some reason ... correct words don't get that much attention from people, and missing words bearly get any attention at all. [\u2014Stephen](/wiki/User:Stephen_G._Brown)20:39, 28 August 2006 (UTC) I understand your sentiment. However, it does seem to contradict the first rule in [WT:ELE#Translations](/wiki/Wiktionary:ELE#Translations). [A-cai](/wiki/User:A-cai) 22:41, 28 August 2006 (UTC) - It's not the same thing. I'm a translator by profession and I'm aware of the trouble bad translations cause. I'm not talking about bad translations here, but about technically correct translations of terms into languages that may not normally be used when speaking of such technology. Only a tiny few of today's languages are fully developed to a point where they can easily describe complex nuclear physics, astronomy, medicine, chemistry, etc., and most of the speakers of the minority languages only speak them at home with close family and friends, to talk about dinner and their children. When they go to work in the morning, they adopt one of a very small handful of super languages such as Mandarin, English, Spanish, Russian, Hindi, German, French, or Portuguese. Their workaday world is carried out entirely in a foreign tongue and they often do not know how to speak of something as simple as a [car battery](/wiki/car_battery)or [dwarf planets](/wiki/dwarf_planet)in their native tongue. However, due to the recent influence of the Internet and new font and keyboard technology, people are beginning to use their languages more openly and for broader purposes. The terms given, for example, at [dwarf planet](/wiki/dwarf_planet)are not bad translations, but some of them are unfamiliar due to the problem that I described. The choice is to (1) give only the Mandarin word in place of the Min Nan; (2) ignore Min Nan and put nothing at all; or (3) give a usage that is correct but unfamiliar to most speakers, since the language hasn't normally been used for technological purposes. The translations there are all good ... and native speakers now have the choice of accepting the Min Nan, changing it to Mandarin or something else, or just deleting it. The term used is the one that is used on the Min Nan Wikipedia. I think this is a much better solution than simply ignoring Man Nan as though it doesn't exist.

[DAVilla](/wiki/User:DAVilla) 00:50, 31 August 2006 (UTC) - According to [fish](/wiki/fish)the plural is either fish or fishes. \"Trout and salmon are fish.\" Sounds fine to me. Is there really a distinction here or is it just a preference on which plural to use? (If it isn't just preerence then the entry on fish should be clarified). [RJFJR](/wiki/User:RJFJR)14:06, 31 August 2006 (UTC) - Sure, but you still couldn't use \"fishes\" to mean several members of that group. Anyway, the question is about the granularity of meaning.

Phrase for a type of chess tactic/confidence game. I have heard a phrase that describes a tactic in which one unskilled chess player simultaneously plays two very skilled players. The skilled players are in different rooms and do not know about each other, each thinks he is only played the unskilled player. The unskilled player plays the white pieces against one opponent, the black peices against the other. He responds to each players moves by using each skilled player's last move against the other. This is also a model for a kind of confidence game. I thought the phrase was something like \"blind chess\" or \"blind man's chess\", but those no hits. Any thoughts?

[RJFJR](/wiki/User:RJFJR) 14:39, 6 September 2006 (UTC) - It is not grammatically a double negative, but neither is it semantically non-redundant.

However, hopefully the party in question will read my discussion and fix the entry. I don't want to get into a tug-of-war, especially with someone who is doubtless more knowledgeable then me in general. However, based on my knowledge at this time, I don't believe the entry is correct. Are we trying to match up with the other online source, i.e. dict.die.net, which has a similiar misapprehension? This word is a subject all by itself. Check out: [http://www.io.com/~dierdorf/ww-38.html](http://www.io.com/~dierdorf/ww-38.html) which agrees with what I am calling the misapprehension. Supposedly there is a 1913 Webster's dictionary, which is cited by dict.die.net. I'm a big fan of \"older is better.\" But sometimes scholarship improves. See: [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=t&p=1](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=t&p=1) It's possible that taffrail came directly from the Dutch tafereel. But whence tafferel?

I have a feeling that will be interesting... epiphany Hey, I just had an epiphany! (Everyone's having 'em nowadays). Maybe the original meaning of the word should be mentioned in the definition? Sorry to have to mention god, but after all, shouldn't we wait a little longer before erasing the meaning of words? (See discussion at that entry) more on tafferel Metaphoric Variation. The metaphoric principle works in the development of variant expressions primarily through the process of assimilation. In general, it works to heighten perceived similarities, which may or may not be historically accurate. Thus the metaphoric principle includes all forms of analogy, long recognized as a prime force in linguistic change. It also includes the often-maligned folk etymology, by which users try to make an unusual or singleton form fit into some perceived pattern. Usually the assimilation suggests that the users have forgotten (or never knew) the original sense of the element that is being replaced by the new metaphoric form: Original Word.............................Evolved To.................By \"look\") Piece Furrer Furrier isle Mandrage (from mandragora) Mandrake Man & drake Mangrow Grove Mocayare Mohair Muscheron, musseroun Mushroom ?

[SemperBlotto](/wiki/User:SemperBlotto) 08:41, 28 September 2006 (UTC) - \"parce\" has no independent meaning and no part of speech, and yes, it exists only in \"parce que\". - \"parce que\", is considered as one word in French (it's the entry that is used in dictionaries).

I can see the argument being made either way, but usually we try to avoid redundant sub-senses, instead recombining them in the parent sense (or rewording the parent sense to cover all the subsenses.) The practice of wontonly \"splitting\" definitions makes entering translations much harder, especially for translators. - Wiktionary currently has: - The wrong name or term. - An unsuitable or misleading name (for something). - plus two other dubious, unrelated definitions that should be cleaned up. - Wikipedia has: - A misnomer is the wrong name or term for something; a misleading name, often idiomatic. - Some sources of misnomers include - A word used in ignorance of the true meaning. - An older name being retained as the thing named evolved (e.g., pencil lead, tin can, fixed income markets, mince meat pie, steamroller). This is essentially a metaphorical extension with the older item standing for anything filling its role. - A name being based on a similarity in a particular aspect (e.g. asteroids look like stars from Earth, the settled portions of Greenland are greener than the rest) - A difference between popular and technical meanings of a term. For example a koala \"bear\" looks and acts much like bears, but from a zoologist's point of view they are quite distinct. Similarly, fireflies fly, ladybugs look and act like bugs and peanuts look and taste like nuts. The technical sense is often cited as the \"correct\" sense, but this is a matter of context. - An older name being retained even in the face of newer information (e.g., Chinese checkers, Arabic numerals). - Ambiguity (e.g., a parkway is generally a road with park-like landscaping, not a place to park). - Some sources of misnomers include - A misnomer is the wrong name or term for something; a misleading name, often idiomatic. - It is clear to me that the Wiktionary entry (while not exactly incorrect) needs to be reworked, but it is not clear that all six (Wikipedia) subsenses are independent definitions. In either case, the translations entered on our [misnomer](/wiki/misnomer)entry are already ambiguous and need the {{tag applied. (I'll wait for the definition to solidify, before adding that.) [checktrans](/w/index.php?title=Template:checktrans&action=edit&redlink=1)}} - Please note that Wiktionarians tend to address such problems in a more thoughtful manner, while Wikipedia (due to number of editors) tends to assign artificial urgency to this sort of situation. Also, the section title here did not make it clear that you want a review of the entry [misnomer](/wiki/misnomer), based on the article [w:Misnomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misnomer). -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie)15:43, 23 October 2006 (UTC) - Hi, Connel. I've been working on this article over on Wikipedia. As far as I'm concerned, the first definition \"wrong name or term\" is somewhat misleading. The most common usage seems to be to say \"X is a misnomer\" (or, interestingly, \"X is a bit of a misnomer\" or even more interestingly \"X is somewhat of a misnomer\"), to mean \"X is not really the right word to use here.\" Essentially the same sense can be used more pejoratively, for example when decrying a mis-labeling born of cultural imperialism. The key here is not that the name is \"wrong\" \u2014 that's a subjective hornet's nest \u2014 but that the speaker is asserting it to be wrong. - Indeed, this seems to be the usual reason that people wanted to go around tagging words in Wiktionary, but this case is subtly different. By trying to call a word a misnomer, as opposed to a particular use of a word, you're asserting that the word itself can't possibly be correct, ever. This is an extremely dodgy assertion. If everyone agrees that \"screwdriver\" means \"vodka and orange juice\", and you can go into a bar, order a \"screwdriver\" and consistenly get vodka and orange juice, then it's not a misnomer, however much someone may want to point out it's not a device used to turn screws (hmm ... shall we claim that the tool actually turns screws as opposed to driving them? Dutch and German, at least, say \"screw-turner\"). - One might want to call a particular sense of a word a misnomer, even though this runs counter to the way words work. I think this is what misnomer-labelers are actually after: There are two senses of the word. I know the \"right\" one, you use the \"wrong\" one. A misnomer is a word with two senses, one in common use (the \"wrong\" one) and one in less common use, or perhaps never widely used at all, but suggested by the form or etymology of the word (the \"right\" one). This is where the second definition comes from. A misnomer is misleading because its common meaning is out of line with its \"true\" meaning. - The third meaning (the Wiktionary jargon one) was based on how misnomer-labelers on Wiktionary seemed to be using it. The tag seemed always to be based on some bit of special pleading based on technical knowledge. Yep, Koalas aren't Ursidae. Does it matter? Didn't matter in Australia until it did (e.g., I turned up a modern Australian book on \"Koalas\", which quoted an older story about \"Koala bears\"). The particularly amusing case, of course, was the infamous [tidal wave](/wiki/tidal_wave), which became incorrect soon after the Boxing Day tidal wave hit, notwithstanding decades of usage to the contrary, nor the arbitrariness of \"tsunami\", nor even that the scientific community \u2014 supposed to be the fount of all correctness \u2014 didn't have its story straight either. - But I digress.

To [levy](/wiki/levy)means to raise or collect money (or troops) by authority and under threat of force. That means that the government can levy taxes, fees, etc., or the city can levy taxes, or the school can levy fees or taxes, or the library can levy fees ... but you cannot levy money from your neighbor, because you do not have such authority over him.

I do not claim to be an master Indian chef, but I have been cooking the food for a couple of decades, both in India and the West and have read widely on the topic. It seems that certain compilers (and I'm mainly talking about compilers of the reference sources quoted) seem to have rushed an entry into their dictionaries without performing any proper research. People who are not conversant with Indian cuisine have then used these sources to form the entries here. There are thus spurious entries, such as the one for ' [curry](/wiki/curry)', which suggests in its first entry that it is a 'mixture of spices' usually counting turmeric. Now, obviously I cannot say that no one ever uses or has ever used it in that sense, but in forty years I have never seen or heard it so used. It is invariably used to mean a dish that is prepared with a mixture of spices (or the sauce for such a dish). Several other dishes or ingredients have similarly spurious or inaccurate entries. I wonder what to do about this. When I tried to correct one, it reverted to the original, inaccurate, version within minutes. Another attempt had the same result although the person doing the reversion did at least add references for his definitions. There I found the problem, which is that, much as I hate to contradict learned sources such as the OED2, the references were either wrong or inadequate. [Moglex](/wiki/User:Moglex) 15:29, 25 October 2006 (UTC) For example, the reference in the OED2, whilst correct, was so short that it did not really impinge on the meaning(s) of the word. The question is: what to do about these errors. There seems to be little point in re-researching all the words and carefully correcting them if the corrections are destroyed moments later. On the other hand, introducing a discussion of each word here would lead to a ridiculous amount of verbiage. - There are a number of things you can do. One is to always give references to a word whose meaning may be questionable. A respected or widely available Indian cookery book would be fine. Remember also that words are used differently in different parts of the world (that first definition of curry is probably American) and you may not have come across some uses. Please continue to contribute - you might like to look at [Appendix:Menus/Indian (British)](/wiki/Appendix:Menus/Indian_(British))and see if you can improve it, correct it, and add definitions for the red links. [SemperBlotto](/wiki/User:SemperBlotto)13:41, 25 October 2006 (UTC) - Continuing with the example of curry, for the moment. I had already checked Webster to see if there was some chance that it was an Americanism, but that does not seem to be the case. I cannot, however, be certain that there is nowhere in the world where they use that meaning. For India, Britain, America, Canada, New Zealand and Austrailia, the current definition is wrong. So what do I do? If I add the correct definition do I put it before or after the incorrect one? If I add references, how will readers know that the references I added belong to the definition I added? Since there are three senses, and the later two depend or copy the first (I believe incorrect) definition, does that mean that they should be duplicated? Changed?

Surely the most common use of the term is in the sense of a meal or dish.

In many cases, the order arises due to historical considerations (i.e. the order in which they were added) more than because any particular ranking is ascribable to them. If you check [WT:ELE](/wiki/Wiktionary:ELE)and [WT:CFI](/wiki/Wiktionary:CFI), you will see that there is no reference made to \"prime\" or \"primary\" definitions, or indeed to any ranking of definitions. Any particular argument as to which definitions are \"more common\", \"more important\", or \"more correct\", are going to necessarily be POV and very likely to differ depending on cultures and geographical regions. That said, it probably makes sense to list very narrow or restricted uses later than a widespread use, but this is not a [hard and fast](/wiki/hard_and_fast)rule. As you can see from the discussion, though, many of the users of this very forum (myself included, having been raised in an area where \"curries\" (dishes) were unheard of, but \"curry\" (spice) as an ingredient for e.g. barbecue sauce was quite common) seem to be familiar with the definition listed first on the [curry](/wiki/curry)entry's page as the \"most common\" usage (in their own experience.) For an example of another word with similar regional variations in use, try [chilli](/wiki/chilli).

If I tell them I don't like wine they think I don't drink at all. This is so deeply rooted it takes about five minutes of arguing with them to get them to understand that \"I don't drink wine\" doesn't mean \"I don't drink alcohol\". (I don't even try with \"I don't drink\", you can forget about it!) And this applies to everyone here who's learned English as a second language. In my opinion this is a complete mistranslation. I'm told you can use in Mandarin for any alcoholic beverage, so calling wine or beer or a cocktail is like calling a Coka-Cola or a Pepsi a \" [soda](/wiki/soda)\".

People can and should use what they want. Consider someone who is fluent in Mandarin, and knows little to no English; they are going to start by using the zh.wikt (Chinese, but kinda-sorta defaulted to Mandarin, there is zh-min-nan, Min Nan, and zh-yue, Cantonese; and I am oversimplifying) to look up words in English, with the interface in Chinese. As they learn enough to use the en.wikt, they will start using it more and more. Ideally, if you are learning English, you want to get to the point where you avoid using your native language wikt (or tranlating dictionary). For example if you are learning from the dead-tree editions, an early objective is to get to the point where you can comfortably use an ordinary dictionary in the desired language; then you are \"immersed\", and things go much more quickly. - On your other point, I used to work for a manager who spoke Cantonese, with a fellow employee who was from Taiwan, and spoke Taiwanese Mandarin (approximately; I didn't know as much then).

His family was originally from northern France, but other than his ancestors and children I've never encountered the name. - No, but it is very rare. In the 1841 British census there was only 1 person with the given name :- I K Brunel (age 35, civil engineer, in Bath), and nobody with the surname in any British census from 1841 to 1901. Isambard was the middle name of his father Marc Isambard Brunel, so I suspect it may be a French surname or placename.

[\u2014Stephen](/wiki/User:Stephen_G._Brown)18:21, 15 November 2006 (UTC) Capitialization in Southeast Asia I've run across some funny capitalization in the personal ads, dismissed as childplay until I realized there was almost a pattern. Although there is a weak tendency to prefer a single case for words, particularly lowercase, which follows the general internet trend, it seems that occasionally, in titles or highlighted segments, certain letters tend to be written in a specific case, e.g. the tail that marks capital L unambiguously, or the lowercase I even for the first person even among other capitalizations. Most of the samples below use a capital A. My guess is that in handwriting this would be more consistent, whereas the number of As typed in the longer segment below makes capitalizing them all impractical.

[DAVilla](/wiki/User:DAVilla)19:13, 16 November 2006 (UTC) hechs I am brand new to wiktionary and apologize if I'm not doing this correctly. I am looking for the meaning of the word hechs. It is used twice in a short story entitled \"Aunt Sally Hillock's Witch Story\" which appeared in \"A Treasury of American Folklore\" edited by B.A. Botkin, 1944. The story itself is copyright 1928. The word is used as follows: \"...stabbed the girl in the small of the back, and she died the death of a hechs.\" AND \"...visited him at his hunting shanty in the Little Valley in the form of a hechs.\" I could not find the word in the dictionaries I searched. [Pdm](/w/index.php?title=User:Pdm&action=edit&redlink=1) 18:52, 21 November 2006 (UTC) - I don't know the story, but this looks like a variation or misspelling of German [Hexe](/wiki/Hexe)or Dutch [heks](/wiki/heks), which mean [witch](/wiki/witch). In German, the combination \"-chs\" is pronounced the same as \"-x\"...in fact, the word for six is [sechs](/wiki/sechs)(pronounced \"sex\"). In German and dutch, the word [Hexe](/wiki/Hexe)/ [heks](/wiki/heks)is very common, and although the dictionary meaning is [witch](/wiki/witch), they are used where we would use the word [bitch](/wiki/bitch). For example, \"du alte Hexe\" (you old bitch). But since your book is a story of witches, this means [witch](/wiki/witch).

(moved from Grease Pit) Redefining: Terms [Latino](/wiki/Latino) and [Hispanic](/wiki/Hispanic). The reason why it is so important to bring about dialogue on this subject is, because of the geo-political and social aspects of how this so-called ethnicity is being used divisively in the media, politics, employment, census, etc. According to most questionnaires (or applications of all sorts) the term Latino/Hispanic is used interchangeably to specify the race and/or ethnic background of a person. However, upon simple probing of the surface, it is clear that this ambiguity is by design, meant to confuse and separate those who should be together. Please consider what Webster has as definitions for the subject mentioned terms: Latino; being of latin origin or decent. Hispanic; pertaining to Spain or Spaniards... Why is it so important? Because of questions demographics and geo-political context as these terms relate to population breakdowns, voting blocks, hiring quotas, even media ratings. Since when did the primary language spoken by a person or a group of persons become indicative of one's race or ethnic group? Case in point, a Black American that speaks English is not British nor would he be thought of as of English decent. So why then are ALL peoples who have Spanish or for that matter, a Hispanic derivative language, being clumped together into one single group? The facts do not support the usage of these words as racial and/or ethnic groups when compared to similar and commonly held ideals about what constitutes race or ethnicity. Because of this, I am challenging ALL anthropologist, sociologist, linguist, historians, political scholars, and those formulating word definitions/context to make a rational determination as to the validity of the current and common usages contributed to the terms Hispanic and Latino relative to them being utilized for racial and ethnic grouping. I am known as an African American. Is that because I speak English or, is it because I was born in America? If an expatriate of an Africa nation, that has English as a primary language, is successful in becoming an American citizen, is he/she then an African American as well? Using that rationale, all Americans (White, Black, Asian, etc.) should be considered as English-Americans... Ask yourself then how is Sammy Sosa a Hispanic or should he be considered an African Dominican, or maybe simply Black? In the groups known as Hispanic/Latino you have; Caucasian, Negroid, Southern/American American Indian, Asian, etc. and these are being jammed together and treated as if it is a valid racial designation. There is just as much racial and ethnic diversity between many of the mentioned groups (from different locales) as there is between a white gentleman from Wales and one from Mississippi or, a person born in Granada and one who was born in Detroit. We must be wiser than the afore mentioned, manipulations would suggest we are. I once read in a murder mystery novel the following, \"Who had the opportunity, motive and who stands to profit most...\" So, ask yourself who would that be? Why is this grouping being done in this way? I think to divide and dilute certain groups while helping to maintain and secure the status quo, the established power base of the supposed majorities. If you take this false designation away from the meaning of these terms, how then would the political, social, racial lines be changed?

I think I'm going to add a Usage Note to all the pages [chateau](/wiki/chateau), [ch\u00e2teau](/wiki/ch%C3%A2teau), [chateaux](/wiki/chateaux), [chateaus](/wiki/chateaus), and [ch\u00e2teaux](/wiki/ch%C3%A2teaux): - Usage note - As a recent loanword, the French spelling involving the circumflex accent on \u00e2, and the French plural involving -eaux, are used in English by many writers and editors who are familiar with the word's French origins. However, as the word becomes more entrenched in English, and as part of the trend away from accented characters, the Anglicized spelling chateau and plural chateaus are also popular. It is difficult to say which forms are more \"correct\" or \"popular\" in English, but the trend is almost certainly towards the Anglicized forms. See also a note at Wikipedia on the [pluralization of foreign words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_plural#Irregular_plurals_from_other_languages). The words \"is almost certainly\" in the second-to-last sentence are debatable. Other possibilities are \"is probably\" and \"may well be\". Anybody else have any other opinions on these usages or how we should present them? [Disclosing my POV: I am an American who knows little French. I would unhesitatingly use the -eaux plural, and think that -eaus looks terrible.

Once there are \"plenty\", the way search engines work, coupled with the time-biased corpus currently used by b.g.c., means that number of cites is not a reliable measure of whether the popularity of a word is increasing or decreasing. It is also impracticable to determine after the fact whether a writer or editor was familiar with the origin of a word. Statements like that rely on the skill of the wiki editor.

Once there are \"plenty\", the way search engines work, coupled with the time-biased corpus currently used by b.g.c., means that number of cites is not a reliable measure of whether the popularity of a word is increasing or decreasing. It is also impracticable to determine after the fact whether a writer or editor was familiar with the origin of a word. Statements like that rely on the skill of the wiki editor.

Safest, I suppose, would be to not take a stand at all, to say \"It is difficult to say which forms are more 'correct' or 'popular' in English\" and leave it at that. \u2014 [scs](/wiki/User:Scs)16:22, 29 November 2006 (UTC) - OK, you are right - our etymologies and usage notes try to convey how we think a word is used, without saying that it always is or must be. But, to properly let the readers draw their own conclusions, citations are the way to go. Calling it OR is missing the point (we are not Wikipedia) - simply providing citations for each spelling is the only thing to unambiguously support each point of contention. - Normal rules of English generally take the borrowed word, without diacritics, and use Anglicized plural forms. - I was about to ask you to cite your sources for these \"rules\" you keep mentioning, but never mind -- rules in someone's book they may be, but they're certainly not universally followed.

Conversely, because the French-ish (without diacritics) plural does see common usage, the normal plural [chateaus](/wiki/chateaus)also needs attestation. The extraordinary case of the French spellings (with diacritics) being used in English is, on the face of it, untenable; so those need citations as well. I am beginning to think that my initial RFV of this was the only correct thing to do; moving to the tea room may have distracted more than it helped. In the end, each form needs citations, or we continue to get misplaced accusations of \"POV\" and \"OR.\" -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie)17:02, 29 November 2006 (UTC) - A quick look at the OED shows that the accented form is very common in English and has been regularly used without any italics for about 150 years. That's certainly the way I would write it. In fact, the OED don't even recognise the unaccented version! I wouldn't call it an \"extraordinary case\" either - lots of people still write [caf\u00e9](/wiki/caf%C3%A9)and [pass\u00e9](/wiki/pass%C3%A9)and [clich\u00e9](/wiki/clich%C3%A9)with no italics.

The diacritics are normally dropped, when the word is naturalized into English. Also, my on-line access to the OED (North American version) when searching for [ch\u00e2teaux](/wiki/ch%C3%A2teaux)returns 5 out of 87 dictionary entries for [chateau](/wiki/chateau)without the diacritics: The Concise Oxford English Dictionary, The New Oxford American Dictionary, The Australian Oxford Dictionary, The Oxford Dictionary of English (2nd edition revised), The New Zealand Oxford Dictionary.

Although by far the most common method, I do not believe it to be the only 'genuinely English' one. Whilst with patterns that are certainly not naturalised, the patterns used to form [cacti](/wiki/cacti), [formulae](/wiki/formulae), [corrigenda](/wiki/corrigenda), are (etymologically incorrect and [octopi](/wiki/octopi) prove that \u2014 these weren't formed due unto 'hypercorrection' \u2014 they are simply the result of misapplied, but definitely familiar and naturalised, patterns of plural formation). The patterns of replacing 'us' with 'i' and adding an 'x' unto a terminal '-eau' are two of the earliest 'irregular' plural patterns learnt (apart from those of the basic vocabulary, which are nonetheless very strangely pluralised, mentioned above) \u2014 it is not at all surprising that [chateaux](/wiki/chateaux) is more common than [chateaus](/wiki/chateaus). What is somewhat surprising is that the form with a circumflex is more common than the form without; however, this can likely be explained by the fact that it is a term quite specific unto France, which will encourage the retention of specifically French features of spelling, such as the circumflex (which I must concede serves no useful purpose in [pronunciatory](/wiki/pronunciatory) terms, unlike the [cedilla](/wiki/cedilla), the [acute](/wiki/acute_accent) and [grave accents](/wiki/grave_accent), and the [di\u00e6resis](/wiki/di%C3%A6resis), which often do, as in [fa\u00e7ade](/wiki/fa%C3%A7ade), [caf\u00e9](/wiki/caf%C3%A9), and [na\u00efve](/wiki/na%C3%AFve)). What is certain is that adding an '-s' is not the only regular and naturalised way of forming plurals in English. [Raifhr Dorem\u00edtzwr](/wiki/User:Dorem%C3%ADtzwr) 02:34, 9 December 2006 (UTC) - In addition, there are the Greek pluralising patterns found in [phenomena](/wiki/phenomena)and [stigmata](/wiki/stigmata), which are also naturalised (the former more so than the latter). [Raifhr Dorem\u00edtzwr](/wiki/User:Dorem%C3%ADtzwr)02:19, 10 December 2006 (UTC) Personally, I think we spend too much time on some of these hair-splitting distinctions. Finding good citations for questioned or contested usages is certainly important and well worth doing, but mere citations (unless perhaps if there are dozens or hundreds of them) are not in and of themselves going to answer the question of which of two competing forms is more or less popular, or more or less standard, or more or less correct, or more British or more American. For something like 99% of the words in the English language, there's precisely one widely-accepted spelling, which we can list without qualification, and for which we can uncontentiously and unceremoniously list any \"nonstandard\" variants or misspellings as such. For a pretty well-known handful of words, fitting a pretty well-understood set of patterns, there is one \"UK/British/Commonwealth\" spelling and vs. vs. [chateaus](/wiki/chateaus) vs. [ch\u00e2teaus](/wiki/ch%C3%A2teaus), [r\u00e9sum\u00e9](/wiki/r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9) vs. [resum\u00e9](/wiki/resum%C3%A9) vs. [resume](/wiki/resume). For these I think we should content ourselves with listing the variants that we can't prove wrong, cross-referencing the others, citing them as necessary, and leaving it at that. For these \"hard\" cases, trying to do anything more -- trying to characterize one variant or another as more or less standard, perhaps with some regional qualification -- is (I fear) an exercise in futility, smacking of Original Research and sometimes even lapsing into comically unnecessary, micro-scale POV-pushing. If I believe (which I do not) that \"any educated person\" knows that ch\u00e2teau is a French loanword such that the French plural ch\u00e2teaux should be used even in English, I can find three durably-archived (and nonitalicized) citations to back me up. If Connel believes (which he does not) that the only correct English spelling is chateaus, he can find three durably-archived citations to back himself up. Etc. So I'm thinking we should spend less time on these \"screw cases\", and more time on the other 99% of the language, not all of which we've got coverage for at this aggressive level of scrutiny. \u2014 [scs](/wiki/User:Scs) 17:31, 10 December 2006 (UTC) I would like a description of the above mentioned disease. \u2014This unsigned comment was added by [70.44.91.30](/w/index.php?title=User:70.44.91.30&action=edit&redlink=1) ( [talk](/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.44.91.30&action=edit&redlink=1) [contribs](/wiki/Special:Contributions/70.44.91.30)) 00:15, 1 December 2006. - It appears to be called \"Pernicious anemia\" today, and there is a [Wikipedia article about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernicious_anemia). \u2014 [scs](/wiki/User:Scs)00:44, 1 December 2006 (UTC) December Scots Gaelic and Scottish Gaelic Cross-posted from the Information Desk : Looking at [Wiktionary:Statistics](/wiki/Wiktionary:Statistics), I see that both Scots Gaelic and Scottish Gaelic have many entries.

I remember asking a Dutch person once, and he said it was something like \"fon choch\" (roughly /fn xx/), where \"ch\" is the sound in \"loch\".

Backhoes are relatively new, and what they replaced were the old [steam shovels](/wiki/steam_shovel). Now, if you look at [a picture](http://www.rootsofmotivepower.com/images/Gallery/imagesFestival2003/SteamShovel.jpg) of a steam shovel (or [this or [this cute one](http://www.clevelandwater.com/Historical/baldwin/reservoir/baldwin_resv_const_09.htm), or [this classic one](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0395259398.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg)), you can see that the digging bucket faces up, and that the machine digs by lifting up and away. A [backhoe](http://eml.ou.edu/Photo/Equip/Atl.Backhoe.111596.jpg), on the other hand, digs by pulling down and back towards the machine. The fact that you don't see steam shovels -- or anything else with that same, old up-and-away action -- any more makes me suspect that the pull-down-and-towards action has been found to be much more effective. (But it had to await the development of modern [hydraulics](/wiki/hydraulics), because a cable-hauled backhoe wouldn't work nearly as well.) Anyway, I suspect that the word [back](/wiki/back) in the name [backhoe](/wiki/backhoe) was chosen specifically because of the back-towards-the-machine action, which was backwards from the way steam shovels worked. Can anyone confirm this? (Our definition does use the words \"drawn backwards\" in passing, but I'm looking for something etymologically definitive.) \u2014 [scs](/wiki/User:Scs) 02:59, 11 December 2006 (UTC) - Is the hoe part on the back of the machine as opposed to the front?

To keep productivity, the replacement should be quick. That implies a stock of \"identical\" parts, rather than parts which need to be adapted to fit, eg by reaming the cylinder bore to match a new piston. Production of parts to such accurate tolerances was first done in gun manufacture by Colt, later sewing machine manufacture by Singer, but was really only applied to larger machines in the 20th century (perhaps first by Ford) and probably only reached machines the size of a steam shovel in about 1940. - Also, a modern excavator relies on the form of fingertip control, developed over many years, which makes it feasible for one man (not two as for a big steam shovel -- one controlling the crane and forward motion, and the other controling the bucket) to control the whole operation in a relatively intuitive fashion.

It just doesn't feel opposite enough for me. But, hay, that's just me. If the man page lists boy, then the woman page should list girl. Similarly, if the woman page lists boy, then the man page should list girl. So, as I see it, we have four options which are as follow. - 1A) Delete boy from both the man and woman page. - 1B) Replace boy with girl on the woman page. - 2A) Replace boy with girl on the man page. - 2B) Add girl to both the man and woman page. - These options obviously would be based on the following premises. - 1) Boy is not an antonym of woman (nor girl of man) - 2) Boy is an antonym of woman (and girl of man) - A) Boy is not an antonym of man (nor girl of woman) - B) Boy is an antonym of man (and girl of woman) - Of these four premises, it's 1 and A with which I agree, however I agree with 1 more strongly than A.

One pitfall, however, is that if the original entry is split too finely to start with, the translation table may accumulate apparent distinctions that aren't really there. - The way I'd apply this would be to start on the lumpy side, but look for difficulties in the translation table. If you see something on the talk page like \"I tried to put in the Elbonian for moon but it's sometimes flooble and sometimes wunk\", then you know you need to split the definition. Why? Because there will also be situations in English where either the given definition doesn't work (too narrow), or situations where the given definition would work but the word is not appropriate (too broad). Like with [ser](/wiki/ser)/ [estar](/wiki/estar), \"There exists snow on the ground.\" is stilted but preserves the meaning, but \"I exist American\" is nonsense. This tells us that \"exist\" is not the only definition for \"be\" (but we knew that already). What Is The Descriptive Term For Single-use Words (Words that exist only in a single phrase) I once heard a discussion on the radio about single-use words. These are words that have generally fallen into disuse other than in a single phrase. For example; - ALECK: smart aleck - BETWIXT: - FRO: to and fro - PETARD: hoisted by one's own petard (see my comment below \u2014 [Paul G](/wiki/User:Paul_G)09:57, 28 December 2006 (UTC)) - RIDDANCE: good riddance I remember that there was a word used to describe these words. A descriptive term used to describe words that only exist in a single phrase. I cannot remember what this word was and it is driving me mad! Can anyone help? - There is an interesting list at [[26]](http://www.ashelf.com/wordlists/v/vev/www/)that calls them \"verbal vestigia\", but that is hardly a standard term. (Describing them as [vestigial](/wiki/vestigial)would be correct, but that isn't what you are looking for. Or maybe that was what the radio show used?) [Robert Ullmann](/wiki/User:Robert_Ullmann)23:18, 22 December 2006 (UTC) Many of these words were once widely used but have fallen into disuse except in certain phrases. The phrase is \"hoist with one's own petard\" (not \"hoisted\"). \"Hoist\" is the past tense and past participle of the archaic word \"hoise\", which means the same as the extant word \"hoist\". Hence the phrase \"hoist with one's own petard\" is a double example of the phenomenon we are discussing. \u2014 [Paul G](/wiki/User:Paul_G) 09:57, 28 December 2006 (UTC) - Some of the words mentioned above now reside in the lexicons of English dialects (not sure which ones though!) a cursory glance of most dialect word lists will confirm this e.g. [category:Geordie](/w/index.php?title=Category:Geordie&action=edit&redlink=1). The word [betwixt](/wiki/betwixt)is in theis dictionary.-- [Williamsayers79](/wiki/User:Williamsayers79)12:37, 28 December 2006 (UTC) There is at least one website [[27]](http://www.gruts.com/misc/akimbos/) that uses the term [akimbo](/wiki/akimbo) for \"any word which is only ever heard in conjunction with one particular other word\". As this usage is not obvious in any high-ranking result in a google search for \"Akimbo\" it seems this has not caught on, and I'd guess it unlikely therefor for this to be the term you remember. [Thryduulf](/wiki/User:Thryduulf) 22:11, 28 December 2006 (UTC) Aronoff (1976) calls these \"cranberry words\" (based on the idea of \" [w:Cranberry morphemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry_morpheme)\").

If not outright wrong, then at least completely redundant. But I have not consolidated the various meanings listed, as the translations entered are different. The word having different nuances in Danish does not imply new meanings in English, do it? Those are just bad translations, misplaced right? -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie) 01:23, 26 December 2006 (UTC) - OK, so here's a good example of what I mentioned elsewhere. First, the first definition is vague. \"Honest\" in what way? Second, I can't think of a situation where fact would mean that. {{rfv-sense}}, anyone? - Let's assume for now that the first sense isn't attested in English. The would mean that fact is not a good translation of Danish faktum; fact is a [false friend](/wiki/false_friend)in that sense. On the other hand, English fact can be translated into Danish in various ways. Assuming that the list given is accurate and complete, that indicates that there are separate senses in English. I'm hedging here because it's not unknown for teachers and language texts to point out distinctions that aren't really there. - The key points are: - The term should translate more than one way, or not be directly translatable at all in some situations. - The alternate translations should not interchangeable. There should be situations where one is accurate but the other isn't. - So if moon translates into Elbonian as either flooble or wunk, but you can only use flooble when talking about the moon in the sky (\"there's a full moon tonight\"), while wunk is used in astronomical discussions of satellites in general (\"the Earth has one moon but Mars has two\"), then you've got good evidence (or confirmation) that the senses are separate. - I completely disagree. If we are describing the English word, the translation breakdown has no bearing at all. In such a case, I would expect one definition that covers both flooble and wunk, with the distinction made in the Elbonian section of [flooble](/w/index.php?title=flooble&action=edit&redlink=1)and [wunk](/w/index.php?title=wunk&action=edit&redlink=1)respectively. Please don't make up words; sticking to real terms is much more exlemplary for the discussion at hand. -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie)19:03, 17 January 2007 (UTC) - I completely disagree. If we are describing the English word, the translation breakdown has no bearing at all. In such a case, I would expect one definition that covers both flooble and wunk, with the distinction made in the Elbonian section of - The classic case is [ser](/wiki/ser)/ [estar](/wiki/estar). In the case at hand, the lack of an English \"honest observation\" sense indicates that the Danish word has a separate \"honest observation\" sense. - Finally, there can be separate senses even if all the translations are the same. That just means that the foreign words have the same senses ans the English words. - [dmh](/wiki/User:Dmh)15:43, 17 January 2007 (UTC) - Of course there can be separate senses, but only if in English they really do have separate senses! -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie)19:03, 17 January 2007 (UTC) - Of course there can be separate senses, but only if in English they really do have separate senses! -- - Did I completely misunderstand what you said there?

This suggests replacing them with something like \"Something accepted or asserted to be known for certain.\" I'd be a bit careful, though. Who's our audience? Nice tight, broadly applicable definitions are satisfying to write, but they can be puzzling to read if you don't already know what they mean. - [dmh](/wiki/User:Dmh) 21:32, 17 January 2007 (UTC) I too found the definitions problematic when I tried to translate them into Finnish. I checked a few English-English dictionaries both in web and in book format, and according to them, there seems to be about four separate meanings for the word \"fact\" (the wordings and examples are mine, combining what I read in the way I understood it): - Something known to be true by observation or reasoning based on observation. - It's a fact that the Earth has only one moon. - The reality as a whole. - Your view on women's rights in Africa is not based on fact - (legal, often pl.) An actual or alleged criminal deed and the circumstances in which it happened. - Something stated to be true. - Your facts are all wrong I leave it to native English speakers to decide whether this could serve as basis for a consensus on this topic. [Hekaheka](/wiki/User:Hekaheka) 15:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC) regional languages and collective peoples I see this all the time where a word that is a language and a region, like [Taiwanese](/wiki/Taiwanese) and [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese), also has a definition \"a person from\" the region, e.g. from Taiwan or China. But I would never start a joke with \"Two Taiwanese walked into a bar\" because first of all they're generally short and wouldn't have to duck, but more pertinently because [Taiwanese](/wiki/Taiwanese) and [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese) are adjectives to me unless they're used with a determiner, as a collective plural, as in \"the Taiwanese\" or \"those silly Chinese\". It could be a which-side-of-the-pond issue but more likely a mistake by non-native speakers. For instance [English](/wiki/English) to this day has translations for \"person from England\" although a person from England isn't an \"English\". Does anybody actually use [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese) in the singular or does this need some attention? [DAVilla](/wiki/User:DAVilla) 09:21, 26 December 2006 (UTC) - I believe on both sides of the pond, the usual term for a Chinese individual is [Chinaman](/wiki/Chinaman), though it's far more common these days to use an adjectival constuction to avoid gender bias. You're right that [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese)as a noun is almost invariably a collective plural. -- [EncycloPetey](/wiki/User:EncycloPetey)22:25, 28 December 2006 (UTC) - To my (American) ears, [Chinaman](/wiki/Chinaman)sounds antiquated and potenially offensive, not only on gender grounds but in that I've only heard it in old derogatory expressions. I don't hear it currently in the US, and I certainly don't think of any of my Chinese friends and coleagues as \"Chinamen\" or \"Chinawomen\". They're just Chinese. - The construction \"An X-ese\" sounds a bit odd grammatically and also slightly antiquated/chauvinist to me, but not nearly so much as \"Chinaman\". A b.g.c search for \"a Chinese is\" turns up a much larger proportion of older cites than usual. - Current US usage tends to avoid both forms and just say \"a Chinese person\", \"a Chinese national\" or \"Yao Ming, who is Chinese\", etc. But maybe that's just the US (or maybe just me?). Both \"a Chinese\" and \"a Chinaman\" are attested, and I've heard both from Americans born before WWII. - The -man form seems irregular. You see \"Frenchman\", \"Dutchman\" and \"Chinaman\" but not \"Germanman\" or \"Thaiman\". - Also note that the very common -an/ian form is used universally in all forms (\"an American\"/\"many Americans\"/\"the Americans\"/\"George Washington was American\"). The uncertainty seems to come in with -ese, and then only in the singular. Here's a table of various forms off the top of my head, leaving aside the -man. I'm quite sure that this doesn't cover all the possibilities, and I'm not asserting that the following are \"correct\" or that other forms aren't in use. - To my (American) ears, |A/an X/the X (as in \"the X sitting at the table\")||Many X||The X (as in \"all the X\")||A/an X author (adjective form)| |-an/-ian (American, Canadian, German, Nigerian, Indian, Brazilian, etc. etc.)||-ans/ians||-ans/ians||-an/ian| |-ese (Chinese, Lebanese, Burmese, etc.), but - There's quite a bit more to be dug out here.

The name Bislama is a corruption of French [b\u00eache de mer](/wiki/b%C3%AAche_de_mer), which means \" [sea cucumber](/wiki/sea_cucumber)\". This makes Bislama the only language in the world I know of that is named after a marine invertebrate. Of course, my favorite discovery in all this was that the Vanuatu national anthem (in Bislama) begins \"Yumi, Yumi, Yumi\", which is also the anthem's title.

I wouldn't think three quotations cuts it for a prefix.
