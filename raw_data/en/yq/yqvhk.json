The newoath, which is printed below, replaces aversion of the Hippocratic Oath thathad been recited by medical students atSUNY Upstate commencement sincethe early 1990s. \"The recitation of an oath upon graduation is a ceremonial recognitionthat this milestone represents more thansimply the granting of an academiccredential,\" said College of MedicineDean Steven J. Scheinman, M.D.\"Medicine is a noble profession thatcarries both privilege and great respon-sibility, and the oath reinforces this.\" The decision to change the oath came about last year when studentssought changes to the White CoatCeremony, the event that marks thebeginning of one's medical education.That served as a jumping off point toreview medical education traditions, including the oath recited atcommencement. Kathy Faber-Langendoen, MD, chair for the Center for Bioethics andHumanities and Medical AlumniEndowed Professor of Bioethics, alongwith other faculty, found the oath'sarchaic and often ambiguous languagean impediment to being understood bystudents. In an informal poll ofstudents, Dr. Faber-Langendoen foundthat many were not certain what someof the phrases meant. \"If the 120 or sostudents reciting this oath aren't sure ofits meaning, then it was time to put it torest.\" A committee of faculty members and two medical students met to craft anew oath, one with greater clarity ofmessage that would be moremeaningful to today's students. Buteven as it sought to bring the oath intothe 21st Century, the committee reliedon the teachings of medicine's mostprominent names from the past,including Blackwell. \"Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell has such strong meaning for this campus that itseemed important that her vision of the medical profession should beincorporated in this new oath,\" said Dr.Faber-Langendoen. Concepts in the new oath that derive from Dr. Blackwell's writings includethe importance of preventive medicineand the need for collaboration betweenwomen and men in the medicalprofession. The new oath retains some elements of the Hippocratic Oath, written in 4BC, and a widely accepted revisionpenned by a Tufts University medicalschool administrator, Larry Lasagna, in1964, as well as the prayer ofMaimonides, a Jewish physician fromthe 12th Century. \"The new oath in very simple prose codifies the core ethics of ourprofession,\" Dr. Faber-Langendoensaid. \"I think it will be helpful to ourstudents if after a few years in practicethey come back to this oath to remindthemselves why they're physicians.\" The new oath will be recited for the first time by medical students at SUNYUpstate's Commencement May 20. I solemnly commit my life to serving humanity. I will give to my teachers the respect and gratitude that is theirdue, and share my knowledge withthose who follow me. I will practice my profession with conscience and dignity. The health of my patient will be my first consideration. I will treat all patients with compassion, no matter how muchthey differ from me. I will respect the secrets patients confide in me. I will remember that the physician's duty is both to preventdisease and to treat it.I will work together with my colleagues as brothers and sisters inservice of our patients. I will maintain the honor and the noble traditions of the profession. I make these promises solemnly, freely, and upon my honor. May I keep this oath and, in so doing, experience the joy of healingthose who seek my help. The Physician's Oath in the tradition of Hippocrates and Elizabeth Blackwell, MDNew physician's oath, with a nod to Dr. Blackwell, debuts at CommencementSUNY Upstate Medical University has now broadened its existinggraduate educational offerings toinclude clergy, seminarians andqualified laypersons to provideexperience that will lead to a greaterunderstanding of how to deliverspiritual care and support in theclinical care setting and in congre-gations. The ability for SUNY Upstate to offer its Clinical Pastoral Educationtraining comes from its recent accred-itation by the Association for ClinicalPastoral Education (ACPE) inDecatur, Ga. The 10-year accredi-tation, which runs through 2016, wasawarded after a rigorous site visit bythe ACPE Accreditation Commissionthat reviewed the university'sprogram, curriculum, clinical setting,facilities and hospital support. Participation in clinical pastoral education training is required forordination by most denominationsand faith traditions, as part oftheological education, and for boardcertification as a chaplain in allnational chaplaincy organizations. According to the Rev. Terry Culbertson, manager of SUNYUpstate's Center for Spiritual Careand a certified supervisor in theAssociation for Clinical PastoralEducation, clinical pastoral educationprograms, like SUNY Upstate's, meetan important need in the religiouscommunity and impact on the largerarena of quality spiritual care offeredby clergy to their members. \"Seminaries and other educational programs for clergy are based onteaching theology and religioushistory, but do not offer manyopportunities to learn how to betterminister to suffering people throughsupervised experience in the clinicalarena,\" she said. \"That's what makesprograms like these so vital andnecessary.\" Students, known as ChaplainInterns, enrolled in the SUNY Upstate programs must complete 300 hours ofdirect pastoral ministry with patientsand families on University Hospitalfloors that specialize in cardiology,oncology, neurology, orthopedics,rehabilitation and pediatrics care.Each does a weekly evening rotationin the emergency department andcompletes 100 hours of clinicalclassroom supervised instruction. \"There is no experience like ministering to patients and families inour emergency room,\" Rev.Culbertson said. \"The range ofsituations and spiritual needs one canexperience in a Level 1 trauma centerare limitless.\" Since Summer 2004, Upstate has been an ACPE Satellite of RobertWood Johnson University Hospitalwhile working towards freestandingaccreditation. Feedback from programgraduates reflects how alumni experience this training as an eye-opener. \"Many initially wanted towalk into an patient's room and makethe hurt go away,\" Rev. Culbertsonsaid. \"That's not going to be possible.Not everything is going to be all rightsimply because a clergy member visitswith a patient. It is human to have theurge is to run from pain and suffering,but our role as spiritual care providersis to be a presence and a comfort indifficult times. That's why we arehere.\" Students get the experience of participating in interdisciplinaryrounds with members of thehealthcare team on clinical units.Other unique experiences includeworking with the School of Medicine'sStandardarized Patient Program, theEmergency Department's simulatedmanikin program, learning fromskilled clinicians to enhance pastoralskills and visiting areas of the campussuch as the Gross Anatomy Lab. SUNY Upstate's Clinical Pastoral Education training program is offeredin two sessions: a 28-week programthat runs from September throughFebruary, and an 12-week summerintensive program that runs from Maythrough July. Up to six students canbe accepted per session, and tuition,application and screening intervieware required. With its ACPE accreditation, SUNY Upstate is now one of 350accredited centers across the countryand joins Albany Medical Center,Strong Memorial Hospital inRochester and Sisters of CharityHospital in Buffalo as the onlyfacilities in upstate New York offeringclinical pastoral education programs. SUNY Upstate's Center for Spiritual Care provides a range ofservices and support to SUNY Upstateemployees, volunteers, and studentsand to University Hospital patientsand family members.
