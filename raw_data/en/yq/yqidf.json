It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.\" a t the School of Medicine, the process of our thinking about the curriculum, for both MDs and PhDs, has undergone a transformation. as you will read in this issue, the MD curriculum has evolved over seven years based both on national perspectives on medical education and on Bu-specific educational initiatives. Our educational programs more closely reflect our patients' current health care needs. The classic model of medical education for the past century (two years of basic science followed by two years of clinical clerkships and electives) has given way to early clinical experiences and the integration of basic science didactic sessions into the third and fourth year; today we are as likely to use small group discussions as large lectures. We continue to teach the core biomedical sciences\u2014human anatomy has not changed for a hundred thousand years or so. But today, as students do their dissections, they also learn radiology by studying the CT scans of the cadavers. Students also see their first patients within a week of starting medical school and start learning how to interview them. Students may practice clinical skills with standardized patients (who definitely note whether they wash their hands, introduce themselves, and make eye contact) before venturing to the clinics to conduct their first physical examinations, and can practice hearing heart sounds with simulators that mimic mitral valve stenosis or a heart gallop rhythm with the turn of a dial. Before they care for their first patients in anesthesiology, they intubate mannequins in the Clinical Skills and Simulation Center until they can skillfully (and confidently) do the procedure rapidly. Our faculty members are deeply invested in finding ways to present material that facilitates learning; at any given time they are involved in a number of studies on educational interventions, the results of which they present and publish. Students often participate in these studies and sometimes contribute to their design, ensuring that the faculty stays attuned to the student experience and their perceptions. Dr. Deborah Vaughan, professor of anatomy and neurobiology and a good example of our dynamic and progressive faculty, is featured in this issue. Dr. Vaughan has significantly modified the histology curriculum and studied the effects of the modifications. She is a true academician and scholar with an intense love of science and teaching and great respect for students. Y ou are probably aware of sequestration and its cuts to Medicare and the budget of the national Institutes of Health, from which we receive hundreds of millions of dollars of grant support. We already have felt the impact of these reductions to our mission of teaching, research, and clinical care; the pace of important research is slowing and we are jeopardizing the careers of the next generation of leaders in science and medicine. We have enacted budgetary adjustments and operational strategies to mitigate the loss of funding as we actively collaborate with our colleagues nationally to let Washington know how devastating the reductions will be to the public health and scientific inquiry. We greatly appreciate the generosity of the School's alumni and friends who continue to support our research projects, particularly at times like these when research budgets are endangered. Class of 1965 graduates Douglas and Donna Barnard have contributed to the School for almost four decades, and we are pleased to share their story in this issue. Thank you for your interest in and commitment to BuSM. With your suggestions, advice, and support, we continue to educate outstanding physicians and make progress in important research.

BUSM joins forces to meet veterans' health care needs BuSM has become part of the Joining Forces Initiative, a col- laboration with the White House, the association of american Medical Colleges ( aaMC), and more than 125 medical schools designed to improve medical education on issues affecting mili- tary personnel\u2014such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI)\u2014and train physicians to meet the health care needs of veterans and their families. The effort provides veterans and their families with health care opportunities and support. BuSM and V a Boston Healthcare System (V aBHS) have developed a specialized curriculum focused on post-deployment mental health and neurological issues; this elective addresses the unique needs of military personnel. The program is designed to educate medical and graduate students on post-deployment mental health and neurological issues to ensure that they are skilled in recognizing and treating both the physical and psychological effects of war. During the last year, the School hosted a number of lec- tures and training opportunities on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment of military injuries. Special Forces Major Gerald DePold, P a, spoke about the Special Forces Medic system for evaluating and managing head injuries, and nation-ally renowned neurologist Douglas katz, MD, lectured on TBI and neuro-rehabilitation. noted Bu researcher and codirector of the Bu Center for the Study of T raumatic Encepholopathy ann Mck ee, MD, lectured on chronic traumatic encephalopa- thy (CTE) and the impact of blast injuries on neuropathology. There have been additional lectures on PTSD, depression, and substance abuse. In conjunction with naval Week last June, BuSM and VaBHS cosponsored an inaugural PTSD and TBI conference featuring poster presentations on cutting-edge PTSD and CTE research conducted at area medical institutions. r ear a dmiral Elaine Wagner and James k elly, MD, presented \"The naval response to PTSD and TBI.\" With one hundred-plus partici- pants and more than 35 posters, the experience served to foster the Joining Forces educational initiatives and bring together researchers, educational leaders, and students.

The longtime BU School of Medicine (BUSM) pro-fessor of anatomy and neurobiology joyfully puts in 12-to-14-hour days teaching and advising current students as well as interviewing and selecting students for admission to the School. She also designed and maintained her department's website for five years before a professional web editor took it over. A veteran of traditional teaching methods, Vaughan welcomes new technolo-gies that advance teaching and learning and leads several School and University commit- tees tasked with determining the best tech - nology tools. Vaughan has received every major teaching award at BUSM. Her great respect for students is the hallmark of her academic engagement: \"I tell new faculty that the first thing you must have is respect for the students,\" she says. \"Respect for who they are, for their time, and respect for what they are asked to accomplish.\" While diverse learning styles is a relatively new phenomenon in education theory, Vaughan has been adjusting her teaching methods to accommodate students for a very long time. \"I am very orga- nized, and when I become too rigid in my teaching presentations to someone who is a random thinker, they can become frustrated,\" she says. \"I realized many years ago that to be successful with students I needed to try a variety of ways of communicating. Now I work to help other faculty members use the most appropriate methods and encourage them to hone their skills in this way.\"Mark Moss, PhD, a member of the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology since 1982 and department chair for 15 years, has known Vaughan for a good portion of her academic career. \"Dr. Vaughan is the consummate educator,\" he says. \"Her ability to make subject matter interesting and relevant and to convey information in an efficient and durable manner\u2014coupled with her commitment to the discipline and professionalism\u2014is unparalleled. Her prowess as an educator has been recognized by her colleagues and students with eight teaching awards, including the Stanley Robbins award, the most prestigious conferred by the School of Medicine.\" Vaughan never planned to teach or work in the field of human medicine. \"As a child, I wanted to be a veterinarian, but women just didn't go into that field then,\" she recalls. \"And frankly, I was from a family where women weren't expected to aspire to a career.\" As a high school student in Concord, New Hampshire, she trained horses for dressage events and taught equitation. \"Once I was asked if I aspired to be a teacher and I said no, but then I recalled that from about the ninth grade, I was teaching horses to perform very specific movements and people the skills to read and communicate nonverbally with the horses,\" she says. Vaughan attended the University of Vermont as an under - graduate in a medical tech program majoring in biology. \"While it became apparent that I enjoyed science and research, I didn't want to go into medicine because I am one of those people who feel uncomfortable around sick people and in hospitals,\" she says. She completed her PhD in biology at Boston University in 1971 and a post-doctoral fellowship in neuroanatomy with Alan Peters, then chair of the BUSM Department of Anatomy. In 1972, she joined an interdisciplinary program project on aging and the nervous system (headed by F . Marott Sinex, chair of the Department of Bio- chemistry from 1957 to 1977) focusing on neuroscience and connec-tive tissue and the effects of advancing age. \"At that time, aging research was not very highly thought of,\" says Vaughan. \"Our work was one of the first to apply the rigor of quantitative science to this area, and the project, now focusing on anatomy and behavior, is in its fortieth year of research. We made significant contributions to early aging studies.\" Vaughan eventually studied peripheral nerve regeneration under her own National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant, focusing on how advancing age affects the ability of neurons to regenerate periph-eral axons. In 1996, Peters asked Vaughan to direct the histology courses for the anatomy and neurobiology department, which meant giving up her research to focus on teaching\u2014and she's been engaged by it ever Respecting students Deborah Vaughan: Teacher, Mentor, Leader8 Campus & Alumni News | BOSTOn unIVErSITY School of Medicine Spring 2013 | www.bumc.bu.edu 9 featureVErnOn DOuCETTEsince. \"I love to see the student who gets excited by the beauty of medicine...who can go from viewing the vocabulary of black dots to nuclei and cytoplasm when they see something on their computer screen that clicks for them.\" She cites the student who hands her a journal article that he or she now understands because of the vocabulary and concepts learned in Vaughan's class and from her lectures, and the one who recently sent her a link to a website featuring dinner plates with histological designs on them that both agreed were beautiful. Vaughan notes the changes in medical student demographics and medical education. \"Twenty-five years ago, our students were mainly male Caucasian with a very intense premedical education that included comparative anatomy, embryology, and physiology,\" she says. \"With a homogeneous, pre-trained student population, faculty could be laboratory based and lecture on their research, which didn't necessarily have much to do with the context of the course they were teaching. \"Now that we have recognized our population of physicians should be a more diverse group socioeconomically, by gender, academic background, race, and religion, we have to be more pro- fessional in our approach to teaching. We have to know about dif- ferent learning styles, about the neurobiology of learning, and how the information we are teaching will be used clinically.\" She also emphasizes the richness that comes from having a diverse student population and the effect it has on faculty, students, and\u2014most importantly\u2014the patients who will be cared for by these physicians. Continually thinking of ways to improve her teaching, Vaughan revamped the process by which histology is taught at BUSM. \"Back in the mid-90s, we decided to hold labs before lectures so that the students would know the vocabulary and would have invested some time in the material before coming to the lecture,\" she says. \"They would be familiar with the microscopic images, making them better prepared for the lecture and allowing class time to be spent talking about the clinical relevance of what they had been looking at and studying.\" Vaughan has been a leader in adopting innovative technol- ogy that advances teaching and learning. She notes that virtual microscopy, whereby digitized microscope slides can be manipu- lated as if in a microscope but are viewed on a computer, has revolutionized histology; any number of students can view slides independently from anyplace, enabling them to study together more easily. \"With virtual microscopy, students can take a screenshot, email it to me, and then get their questions answered quickly,\" she says. She also cites technologies like the audience response system that offers immediate feedback to faculty on how well students understand their lectures, and Blackboard, the learning management system where faculty can manage all of their course materials online and students can access them anytime. \"So many of these technologies involve opportunities for self-study producing lifelong learners, which is what we want our students to be,\" she says. She also pioneered the adoption of computer-based examinations for the pre-clerkship years of medical school.At the same time, she is cautious about technology\u2014 students no longer have to attend class as all lectures are videotaped\u2014and worries that they are losing some face-to-face communication skills by missing the facial expressions and body language so important to the practic- ing clinician: \"They tend to interact in a virtual way, so my concern is that technology is allowing them to miss out on an important aspect of our complete education. We can't force them to come to class, so my current push is to encourage our faculty members to make our lectures value added\u2014give them spontane-ity, make them interactive, and provide some clinical context that excites discussion.\" What she does must be working, as students rate her very highly. \"This is an amazingly well-run course,\" writes a student evaluating Vaughan's class. \"I never thought histology would be even remotely interesting, and somehow Dr. Vaughan made the topic not only interest-ing but relevant to our future practice.\" Another writes, \"Dr. Vaughan is amazing, and a very devoted and knowledge- able professor.\" She is also highly regarded by her col-leagues. \"Debbie Vaughan is an exceptional person, a wonderful colleague, and an outstanding educator,\" says Jarrett Rushmore, PhD, assistant professor of anatomy and neurobiology. \"Her effectiveness as a professor comes in part because she is willing to work harder than anyone for her students. She is constantly adapting and improving her teaching, and she incorporates new thinking and technology to that end. I think what really makes her a first-rate professor is that she fundamentally believes that education is not simply about imparting knowledge, but lies more in challenging students (and colleagues) to be more than they are. She has high and clearly stated expectations of her students\u2014she gives them the tools to achieve their goals and guides them with devotion and unflagging energy. Her students invariably find that over the course of the semester, they are able to achieve at levels they did not think previously possible, and they are better for having taken her course.\" Vaughan credits BUSM with supporting and promoting faculty dedicated to teaching. \"This demonstrates a true commitment to the mission of medical education,\" she says. \"We have some faculty who are hired solely as educators and whose research focuses on medical education, and others, like me, who have been allowed to retire our research to teach full time.\" She notes that almost every basic science department has full-time educators as their course directors: \"We are available to serve on the committees, we mentor new teachers, keep up with technology, and give direction to this high quality product that is a BUSM education.\"When Vaughan is not teaching or mentoring, she is review - ing applications and interviewing potential students. A member of the Admissions Committee for 17 years and an assistant dean of admissions for 10, Vaughan is extremely familiar with the stu- dent body. \"I know how exceptional our students are, and faculty need to understand the breadth of experience they have and how accomplished they are,\" she says. \"In all fairness, we also have to be explicit about our expectations and realize that understand- ing doesn't come easily and immediately to everyone at the same pace.\" She also worked for 10 years with the Admissions Office and IT to develop and implement an automated admissions informa- tion management system. \"Over the last decade, BUSM has taken a lead role, at the national level, in advancing a program of holistic review of all applicants, and Dr. Vaughan has been a key member of the leader - ship team,\" says Robert Witzburg, MD, BUSM associate dean for admissions. \"She is a role model, and we all have developed great respect for her integrity, her commitment, and her ability to find innovative solutions to complex problems.\" Vaughan is always in great demand. In addition to her many other activities, she serves on the BUSM Student Services and Medi-cal Education Committees, is an advisor in the Academy of Advisors, and chairs the Pre-clerkship Curriculum Subcommittee. She has also served as thesis advisor in the Master of Medical Sciences Pro-gram for the Division of Graduate Medical Sciences, has been a PhD research committee member for 11 students, and serves on the MD-PhD Steering Com-mittee and the Planning Com- mittee for the Neuroscience of Education Program. Her all-University commitments include co-chairing the Teach- ing and Learning Technologies Governance Committee and membership in the University Committee on Student Life and Policies. \"I have known Debbie Vaughan for 17 years,\" says Doug Hughes, MD, associate dean for academic affairs. \"She is a luminary who has graciously mentored generations of both medical students and junior faculty. Debbie's modesty is matched only by her brilliance.\" Vaughan says she has remained at BU for 40 years because she feels she is in sync with the philosophy of the institution: \"I love the attitude of doing your best for others, the quality of the students, and my colleagues. This is one very satisfying job, and I thoroughly enjoy it.\" n Vaughan credits BUSM with supporting and promoting faculty dedicated to teaching. \"This demonstrates a true commitment to the mission of medical education,\" she says. She has high and clearly stated expectations of her students\u2014she gives them the tools to achieve their goals and guides them with devotion and unflagging energy. 10 Campus & Alumni News | BOSTOn unIVErSITY School of Medicine Spring 2013 | www.bumc.bu.edu 11 CYDnEY S COTTAt Boston University School of Medicine and its Division of Graduate Medical Sciences (GMS), changes in educating future physi- cians and scientists to accommodate this new reality are reflected in curriculum revisions and enhancement of both the medical and doc-toral degrees. Key to these changes is integrating knowledge fields and interdisciplinary approaches to teaching and learning. the integrated curriculum\u2014 preparing 21st- century clinicians > The lifelong practitioner of medicine needs to apply an integrated understanding of contemporary medicine in a professional manner to the care of the individual within the patient's personal, cultural, socioeconomic, and health care system context. Clinical Skills Curricula for Undergraduate Medical Education, Association of Ameri- can Colleges Task Force on Clinical Skills Education of Medical Students The explosion of medical knowledge and technology advances, and the re-evaluation of the physician's role in patient care and the patient's role in his/her own care has catalyzed the implemen- tation of curricular changes in medical student education. The information and technology physicians must master to prevent and treat disease continually advance, requiring new approaches to preparing physicians for caring for patients. The changing nature of the nation's health care system as well as the growing diversity of the US population\u2014which is reflected in the corresponding growing diversity of the medical student population\u2014adds to the need for new educational strategies to provide effective learning opportunities and structures to support lifelong learning. Traditionally, undergraduate medical education has been divided along the lines of two years of pre-clinical acquisition of dis - cipline-based, basic science knowledge lacking in clinical context, while the third and fourth years are spent in clinical rotations not explicitly linked to previously learned basic science. Medical stu- dents could enter their clerkship years with little clinical experience and few clinical skills\u2014not the optimal situation for the students or their patients. Recognizing these limitations and the shift in teaching and learning theory and practice, BUSM began a curriculum reform initiative more than seven years ago that continues as a dynamic process to offer students learning opportunities to present medical knowledge that is clinically relevant starting on the first week and spanning the four years of their medical education. \"We have worked hard to bring horizontal and vertical integration of the curriculum, incorporating greater clinical experiences and training in the first two pre-clerkship years and reintroducing core basic sciences in the two years of formal clini-cal training,\" says Douglas Hughes, MD, associate dean for aca- demic affairs and professor of psychiatry. \"Horizontal integration brings together the traditional disciplines with topics discussed across courses and vertical integration of basic science with early clinical experience and ongoing inclusion of science in the clerk - ship years. \"The integrated model prepares students to be lifelong learn- ers, increases their understanding of biological principles and their clinical context, promotes teamwork among the different health care disciplines, and better utilizes technology to sup-port learning,\" adds Hughes, who is also the Ramsey Professor of Medicine. The disciplines of gross anatomy, histology, human behavior in medicine, biochemistry, physiology, genetics, neuroscience, endocrinology, and immunology remain the core of the first-year curriculum, but faculty incorporate the clinical relevance of the material with case-based discussions in both lectures and small groups. Direct patient contact is offered in the Introduction to Clini- cal Medicine course, where students learn interviewing and physical exam skills. \"The clinical exposure first year is fantastic, and the strong focus on clinical skills in addition to the strenuous academic program is part of what drew me to BU,\" says Thomas Dohle, a first-year student. \"Overcoming my initial discomfort early on with some aspects of patient interaction has made me much more confident. Introduction to Clinical Medicine is my weekly reminder of why I'm going into medicine. It's easy to get bogged down with the massive amount of information that first-year medical students have to learn, so having a weekly chance to actually interact with patients and develop the interpersonal skills that we will need as physicians is great.\" Introduced in 2008, the second-year curriculum, Disease and Therapy (DRx), treats the pathophysiology and treatment of disease in an integrated, organ-based course along with the continuation of clinical medicine and integrated problems courses. Modules address diseases of the cardiovascular system; lungs, kidneys, joints, and connective tissue; the gastrointestinal system; the endocrine and reproductive organs; and the nervous system and psychiatric disorders; and oncology is taught in conjunction with hematol - ogy. Health law, policy, and management systems are incorporated throughout this curriculum. Both clinical and preclinical faculty members teach DRx, emphasizing case-based discussions and online case-based exer - cises, workshops with clinical faculty, and discussions with patients. Clinical skills training in patient interviewing, history-taking, and physical examination at Boston Medical Center and other clinical sites continues in the second year. Students practice clinical skills with standardized patients and undergo end-of-the-year evalua- tions by clinical faculty. What does it mean to educate physi - cians and scien- tists? This question is central to medical and science education theory and design. What is to be taught and learned\u2014the curriculum\u2014provides the framework for the educa- tion process. The rapid expansion of technology in the past two decades has vastly changed both medical practice and how clinical and basic science research is carried out. DR. Right CReatingfeature Curriculum reform continues as a dynamic process to offer students learning opportunities that are clinically relevant starting on the first week and spanning the four years of their medical education. drs. hughes and hyman 10 Campus & Alumni News | BOSTOn unIVErSITY School of Medicine12 Campus & Alumni News | BOSTOn unIVErSITY School of Medicine Spring 2013 | www.bumc.bu.edu 13 feature The required clerkships in third year are now aligned to maxi- mize continuity and clinical relevance. Pediatrics and ob-gyn are offered back to back, and family medicine and psychiatry overlap as well, while surgery and radiology are linked, as are medicine and neurology. Fourth year remains dedicated to electives, with oppor - tunities for experience with global health programs and under - served populations. \"An integrated approach to medical education makes sense on many levels as the models of disease and treatment that we begin to build throughout first- and second-year training are based on an integration of our knowledge of physiology, pathology, pharmacol- ogy, microbiology, etc.,\" says second-year student Justin McCool. \"The integrated DRx curriculum facilitates building these models by presenting the essential elements of disease and treatment as a complete picture rather than a single piece of a large and com-plex puzzle.\" To keep a check on how effective the curriculum is at preparing BUSM students for medical practice, certain metrics are tracked. Hughes notes that the first-attempt pass rate for the Step 1 of the US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) increased from 90 percent four years ago to 98 percent last year and for Step 2 of the USMLE, students have a 99 percent pass rate on the first try. In the senior survey, graduating students now indicate a much higher satisfaction with their basic science and clinical courses as well as with their overall education and the School. \"One of the most important metrics we use to evaluate our medi- cal education program is the survey of residency directors of our graduates in their first year of residency,\" says Hughes. \"Our students are performing very well and are highly rated as good doctors by these directors. This is a great endorsement of what we are doing.\" In addition to curricular changes to create a more cohesive and effective experience for students, the School has identified teaching faculty and recruited teaching scholars whose major responsibility is teaching and who have the expertise and command of learning theory to best communicate with students. \"We now have an educator track along with clinician and research tracks to advancement,\" says Dean Karen Antman, MD. \"This makes education an equal partner with research and clinical endeavors, bringing greater resources to our academic program and the students' experience. Excellence in teaching is recognized and rewarded.\" \"You may have an expert in a certain field who is a researcher or even clinician who lectures to scientists and world leaders, but is not used to lecturing in an introductory way. They likely are not the most effective teachers,\" notes Hughes. \"Ten years ago, psychiatry had about 30 faculty members lecturing to the students. Now we have five dedicated teachers across the four years who are more con - nected to the students and are invested in the learning process. We get to know students and their strengths and weaknesses.\" Hughes notes that these full-time educators who arc over the whole curriculum can more easily identify gaps and minimize redun-dancies. Teaching faculty are also clerkship directors, which adds to a more seamless meshing of clinical science and clinical skill applica-tion. Evaluation is key to all changes and advances in the teaching and learning experience at BUSM. With the implementation of an online evaluation system, every six weeks students can evaluate faculty and courses, facilitating adjustments in real time and avoiding missed opportunities for teaching and learning. \"We are in the vanguard,\" says Hughes. \"But we must be vigilant and adaptive, as medical education does not exist in a vacuum. It is a dynamic enterprise.\" training the n ext g eneration of s cientists: Foundations in Biomedical s ciences Several years ago Linda Hyman, PhD, associate provost of the Divi- sion of Graduate Medical Sciences, asked GMS program directors and course managers to create a more integrated and interdisciplin - ary learning experience for graduate students in many of the PhD programs. \"Science today is driven by interdisciplinary programs and research,\" says Hyman. \"The imperative behind this undertaking has been to create a curriculum based on the foundational principles that are inherent in our graduate program, grow the sense of community in our graduate student body, and have a more efficient interdisciplin- ary way of teaching and learning.\" The result is a core curriculum named Foundations in Biomedical Sciences (FIBS). There are 14 doctoral programs of study in GMS, each with its own independent curriculum. This requires students to have a foun-dation of knowledge of other disciplines. For example, a student in the Genetics and Genomics Program is required to have a founda- tion in biochemistry, while students in the Department of Biochem-istry need a basic understanding of the principles of immunology and genetics. According to Hyman, the program evaluation opened a debate about what concepts of biomedical science are essential for all doctoral students to know, regardless of what discipline they ultimately choose. During an 18-month period, the Curriculum Revision Commit - tee met weekly to discuss and determine the structure of the cur - riculum. \"We looked at myriad frameworks, like what the National Institutes of Health organize around, how key textbooks are struc-tured, and what curricular strategies colleagues in our peer institu- tions were using,\" says Karen Symes, PhD, co-director of FIBS, an associate professor of biochemistry and assistant dean of student affairs. \"We kept at it until we ended up at a place that reflected the needs and values of this institution. We are training the next genera- tion of scientists, not just textbook learners. That was a major driv - ing force behind this change.\" \"We had these separate discipline-based courses that no lon - ger mirrored how science is actually done,\" says Shoumita Das-gupta, PhD, codirector of FIBS and an associate professor and the program's director of graduate studies in genetics and genomics. \"Modern science is interdisciplinary. We work in teams and people need to be able to cross disciplines and be familiar with the specific nature of experiments and inquiry within those other disciplines.\" The FIBS curriculum is an integrated modular program of core competencies designed for first-year doctoral students. It serves as a foundation for their doctoral education and encourages students to think in an interdisciplinary fashion by coordinating content across courses, programs, and departments. It is also designed to reduce redundancy in course content, decrease lecture hours, and promote collegiality among doctoral students. There are four core modules in the first year\u2014three in the fall and one in the spring\u2014along with a choice of three additional modules consisting of electives that allow students to take an integrated course in another discipline. The modules begin with biochemistry and bio-physics in Module I; the structure and function of the genome and how to access and use it follows in Module II; Module III deals with cellular organization; and Module IV focuses on the mechanisms of cell communication, progressing from individual cells to multicel- lular organisms. Three optional modules examine human metabolism and the impact its dysregulation has on disease; the study of diseases from the physiological standpoint; and translational genomics look - ing at technology and how it is utilized in the laboratory. Each module has two course directors from different disciplines who attend every lecture and evaluate each module at its comple - tion. Their extensive involvement supports greater integration of the critical knowledge graduate students are required to master and is a key feature of the program. \"Opening the channels of communication has been very important,\" says Dasgupta. \"Previously, courses were offered by a department or by a program with a single course director who operated almost unilaterally to meet the needs of only that program's students. With the new founda- tions curriculum, we have a core group of course directors across the disciplines who regularly interact and communicate to address the needs of all of our students as beginning scientists.\" Designed to be challenging and interactive, the modular struc- ture can be modified to adapt to individual or program needs, and each includes a critical thinking component facilitated by small group sessions and workshops. The revisions have also aided in greater experimentation around curriculum and increased small group interaction and problem solving. The small group sessions are led by senior students, giving them teaching experience not previously possible. \"We have built in oppor - tunities for seniors to work with FIBS students,\" says Dasgupta. \"An important goal has been to mentor scholarly activities, so we devel-oped a teaching fellowship for students to teach in the modules. The interaction between juniors and seniors has been highly beneficial for both groups, and this year, for example, Module II has five sections with a student facilitator in each.\" Along with faculty advisor cooperation, department chairs have been highly supportive of the revision process and its outcome. \"We were asking a lot of their faculty, and this process has been a major time commitment,\" says Dasgupta. Dasgupta and Symes are developing a feedback process for program directors and faculty to communicate their assessment of the effectiveness of the new curriculum to help ensure that the foundations model meets the needs of the students as well as the requirements of the various disciplines. An additional benefit of the core curriculum is a greater sense of community among the students with the increased opportunities for interaction and more shared experiences. Hyman also sees this as an opportunity to enhance recruitment. \"The revised curriculum sends a message to prospective students that BU has a graduate science program that is focused on the best way to teach scientific knowledge, invest in student achievement, and help students take their knowledge to the next level.\" n \"We kept at it until we ended up at a place that reflected the needs and values of this institution.\" karen symes, Phd \"Opening the Channels of communication has been very important.\" shoumita dasguPta, Phd CYDnEY S COTT14 Campus & Alumni News | BOSTOn unIVErSITY School of Medicine Spring 2013 | www.bumc.bu.edu 15 Research in Brief researchers from the Bu Schools of Medicine and Public Health have been awarded a five-year, $2.5 million training grant by the Burroughs Wellcome Fund to support special-ized, multidisciplinary PhD training for addic- tion of medi- cine, neurology, ophthalmology, and genetics and genomics and chief of biomedical genet - ics at Bu School of Medicine (BuSM), and Timothy Heeren, professor of biostatistics at Bu School of Public Health (BuSPH), will lead the T ransformative T raining Program in addiction Science (TTP aS). Farrer codirects the nation's largest genetics study of cocaine, opiates, alcohol, and nicotine addiction among Caucasians and a frican americans. Heeren is currently studying the effects of maternal cocaine use on child development and the impact of alcohol addiction on HIV treatment outcomes. \"addictions to smoking, alcohol, and illicit drugs are among the nation's most critical pub-lic health and societal problems,\" the proposal summary says. \"The genetic vulnerability, envi- ronmental exposures, and individual behaviors that contribute to the brain dysfunction and compulsive tendencies that mark addiction make it one of the most complicated diseases to study and treat. \"Some researchers, especially at Boston university, have developed multidisciplinary collaborations, but training addiction scientists still proceeds in disciplinary silos, preventing emergence of the broad skill set needed for genuine breakthroughs. TTP aS will prepare investigators to apply diverse approaches to addiction research using tools from bench sci-ence, medicine, population studies, statistics, and computational biology.\" TTPaS will have three core components: a biweekly seminar focusing on how different disciplines approach a similar issue on addic- tion; multiple mentors from different disci- plines for each trainee and multidisciplinary dissertation committees; and a clinical module enabling trainees to interact with people in addiction treatment and recovery. T o facilitate effective communication, the program includes a concentrated effort to achieve student diver - sity and to assure that all trainees have a thor - ough understanding of the intellectual bases, techniques, and languages of reporting in all the disciplines. The coleaders will be supported by a large group of established Bu addiction scientists in medicine, psychology, neuroscience, phar - macology, biology, psychiatry, social work, engineering, biostatistics, informatics, health services research, and public health who are already linked through multidisciplinary fac- ulty seminars. Bu faculty investigators currently direct more than 50 funded addiction-related research projects, including pharmacological and neurocognitive mechanisms regulating drug withdrawal and relapse in animal models; the relationship between long-term alcohol abuse and decrements in brain structure and cognitive-emotional functioning; and the effi- cacy of pharmacological treatments of alcohol-ism in a clinic population. The Burroughs Wellcome Fund is an independent private foundation dedicated to advancing the biomedical sciences by support - ing research and other scientific and educa-tional activities. Within this broad mission, the fund has two primary goals: T o help scientists develop as independent investigators early in their careers, and to advance fields in the basic biomedical sciences that are undervalued or in need of encouragement. n n Largest case series of C te published introduces four-stage disease classification Investigators at the Bu Center for the Study of T raumatic Encephalopathy (CSTE) and the Veterans affairs Boston Healthcare System, in collaboration with the Sports Legacy Institute (SLI), have described 68 new cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) among deceased athletes and military veter - ans whose brains and spinal cords were donated to the V a CSTE Brain Bank. Of the 68 cases, 34 were former professional football players, nine had played only col- lege football, and six had played only high school football. The results, published in the December issue of the scientific jour - nal Brain, represent the largest case series of CTE published to date, doubling the number of pub- lished CTE cases internationally. ann Mck ee, MD, BuSM professor of neuropathology and director of the neuropathology Service for V a new England Healthcare System and co-director of the CSTE, led the study, which is the first to character - ize the pathology of the disease into four stages of severity. CTE is a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated brain trauma\u2014including concussions and multiple subconcussive exposures such as those in contact sports and military combat\u2014and appears to be slowly progressive in most individuals. In the early stages, CTE is characterized by the presence of abnormal deposits of a protein called tau in the form of neurofibrillary tangles, glial tangles, and neuropil threads throughout the brain; these tau lesions even- tually lead to brain cell death. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed postmortem. The report provides specific pathological criteria for the diagnosis of CTE and divides CTE into four stages of disease. \"This study extends our knowl-edge concerning the spectrum of the clinical and pathological abnormalities associated with CTE,\" said Mck ee, who also is director of the Brain Banks for Bu's alzheimer's Disease Center and the CSTE, which are based at the Bedford V a Medical Center in Bedford, Massachusetts. \"However, further studies are needed to investigate critical aspects of this trauma-induced neurodegeneration, including the incidence and preva- lence of CTE; whether the symptoms of CTE are dis- tinctive from other conditions; how genetics influence susceptibility or resistance to CTE; and whether other environmental exposures play an additive role in the development of CTE.\" n potential of differentiated ipS Cells in Cell t herapy without Immune r ejection Shown a study by BuSM researchers showed that tissues derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in an experimental model were not rejected when transplanted back into genetically identical recipients. The study, published online in Cell Stem Cell, demon-strates the potential of utilizing iPS cells to develop cell types that could offer treatment for a wide range of conditions\u2014including diabetes, and liver and lung diseases\u2014without the barrier of immune rejection. ashleigh Boyd, DPhil, and neil r odrigues, DPhil, the study's senior authors, are assistant professors of dermatology at BuSM and researchers at the Center for r egenerative Medicine (Cr eM) at Bu and Boston Medical Center (BMC). By returning them to a stem cell state using genetic manipulation, iPS cells can be developed from adult cell types, such as skin or blood. The study results suggest that using patient-specific iPS cells should overcome issues of immune rejection in transplantation, which will be a significant problem for potential embryonic stem cell-derived therapies. Immune rejection in transplantation is treated clini- cally by immunosuppressive drugs, but they can have serious side effects, including the risk of developing cancer. \"If the use of immunosuppressive drugs can be avoided, as may be the case for patient-specific, iPS cell-based therapies, it would be preferable. Our results are very promising, and future work should be directed at assessing whether tissues derived from human iPS cells will similarly lack immunoge-nicity,\" said Boyd. r esearch reported in this release was supported by an Institutional Development award (IDea ) from the national Institute of General Medical Sciences of the national Institutes of Health (nIH). n Genetic v ariants' r ole in Increasing parkinson's disease risk Studied BuSM investigators have led the first genome-wide evaluation of genetic variants associated with Parkinson's disease (PD).

The researchers examined the relationship between PD-associated genetic variants and levels of gene expression in brain samples. \"The identification of the specific altered genes in PD opens opportuni- ties to further study them in model organisms or cell lines with the goal of identifying drugs which may rectify the defects as treatment for PD,\" said richard H. Myers, PhD, BuSM professor of neurology, the study's principal investigator and senior author. This study was funded by the Cogan Family Foundation, the Bumpus Foundation, and the national Institute of neurological Disorders and Stroke (nInDS). n heavily Indebted medical Students Choosing p rimary Care Careers f ace Greater f inancial Challenges BuSM and the association of american Medical Colleges ( aaMC) researchers have determined that heavily indebted medical students choosing primary care careers will experience difficulty paying their student debt unless they consider alternative strate- gies to support repayment. These findings appear online in Academic Medicine, the peer-reviewed j ournal of the aaMC. Most medical school graduates have education debt, the average amount of which is increasing. In 2011, 86 percent had education debt at graduation averaging $161,290, the highest total to date. among the indebted graduates, 23 percent of those at private medical schools graduated with loans of $250,000 or more. The authors used comprehensive financial-plan- ning software developed by Lawrence k otlikoff, PhD, professor of economics at Bu, and other economists to model the annual finances for a fictional physi- cian's household to compare the impact of various debt levels, repayment plans, and living expenses across three specialties. \"Our results show that student debt levels have become so high that a growing number of students will struggle on a primary care salary alone to repay educational loans and still have enough left over to cover other routine household expenses,\" notes senior author John Wiecha, MD, MPH, associate pro- fessor of family medicine and an assistant dean for academic affairs at BuSM. Partial funding for this study was provided by a Primary Care T raining grant (#D56HP10305-03-00) from the Health r esources and Services administration, uS Department of Health and Human Services. n potential Key to halting emphysema progression, r eversing d amage Identified a study led by BuSM researchers has shown that a compound used in some skin creams may halt the progression of emphysema and reverse some of the damage caused by the disease. When the compound Gly-His-Lys (GHk) was applied to lung cells from patients with emphysema, normal gene activity in altered cells was restored and damaged aspects of cellular function were repaired. GHk is a natural pep- tide found in human plasma, but the amount present decreases with age. The study, published in Genome Medicine, also demonstrates the potential impact of using genomic technologies to identify new possible treatments for diseases using existing drugs and compounds. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic, progressive lung disease that com-prises emphysema, small airway obstruction, and/ or chronic bronchitis and leads to the loss of lung func- tion. Currently there is no cure and no effective thera-pies to reduce the rate of lung function decline that occurs as the disease progresses. \"Our study results showed that the way genes were affected by the compound GHk, a drug identi-fied in the 1970s, was the complete opposite of the pattern we had seen in the cells damaged by emphy - sema,\" said Marc Lenburg, PhD, BuSM associate professor in computational biomedicine and bioinfor - matics and one of the study's senior authors. research reported in this published article was supported by the national Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (nHLBI) and through the nIH Boston university Clinical and T ranslational Science Institute. r esearchers from the university of British Columbia, the university Medical Center Groningen (netherlands), and the university of Pennsylvania also collaborated on this study. n New Gene Linked to pt Sd Identified Investigators at BuSM and Veterans a ffairs (V a) Boston Healthcare System have identified a new gene linked to post-traumatic stress disorder. The find- ings, published online in Molecular Psychiatry, indicate that a gene known to play a role in protecting brain cells from the damaging effects of stress may also be involved in the development of PTSD. The study reports the first positive results of a genome-wide association study (GW aS) of PTSD and suggests that variations in the retinoid-related orphan receptor alpha (r Ora ) gene are linked to the development of PTSD. Mark W. Miller, PhD, BuSM associate professor and a clinical research psychologist in the national Center for PTSD at V a Boston Healthcare System, was the study's principal investigator. Mark Logue, PhD, BuSM research assistant professor of biomedi- cal genetic, and Clinton Baldwin, PhD, BuSM profes-sor of biomedical genetics, were co-first authors of the paper. Previous GW aS studies have linked the r Ora gene to other psychiatric conditions, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, autism, and depression. \"Like PTSD, all of these conditions have been linked to alterations in brain functioning, so it is particularly interesting that one of the primary functions of r Ora is to protect brain cells from the damaging effects of oxidative stress, hypoxia, and inflammation,\" said Miller. \"These results suggest that individuals with the r Ora risk variant are more likely to develop PTSD following trauma exposure and point to a new avenue for research on how the brain responds to trauma.\" The study was supported by the national Institute of Mental Health of the national Institutes of Health and a grant from the Department of Veterans a ffairs. n Gene Linking Cataracts and Alzheimer's disease Identified BuSM and BuSPH investigators have identified a gene linking age-related cataracts and alzheimer's disease. The findings, published online in PLOS ONE, contribute to the growing body of evidence show - ing that these two diseases, both associated with increasing age, may share common etiologic factors. Gyungah Jun, PhD, from the departments of medicine, ophthalmology, and biostatistics at BuSM and BuSPH, served as the study's lead author. using the Framingham Offspring Eye Study cohort, investigators looked at brain magnetic resonance imaging (MrI) findings on or after 10 years from the original eye exam and concluded that there was a significant correlation between a quantitative measure of cortical cataract and sev - eral alzheimer's disease-related measures of brain degeneration, in particular volume of the tem- poral horn, a brain structure that is progressively enlarged in patients with alzheimer's disease. \"Though much work remains to be done, a link between cataracts and alzheimer's disease supports the idea of a systemic rather than brain-limited focus for processes leading to alzheimer's disease,\" said Lindsay a. Farrer, PhD, BuSM professor neurology, ophthalmology, genetics & genomics, epi-demiology, and biostatistics, chief of the Biomedical Genetics Section, and the study's senior author. \"This study gives us hope that we are moving toward earlier diagnosis and new treatment targets for this debilitating disease.\" This study was supported by grants from the national Institute on aging for investigated-initi-ated projects and the Boston university alzheimer Disease Center, national Institute of General Medical Science, Wellcome T rust, Medical r esearch Council, Canadian Institutes of Health r esearch, alzheimer Society of Ontario, and Ontario r esearch Fund. n pathology of huntington's disease Identified a study led by BuSM researchers provides fresh insight into the impact that Huntington's disease (HD) has on the brain. The findings, published online in Neurology, pinpoint areas of the brain most affected by the disease and open the door to understanding \"this study gives us hope that we are moving toward earlier diagnosis and new treat - ment targets for this debilitating disease.\" 86 percent of medical school graduates had education debt at graduation averaging $161,290, the highest total to date.18 Campus & Alumni News | BOSTOn unIVErSITY School of Medicine Spring 2013 | www.bumc.bu.edu 19 Research in Brief\"this data demonstrates a very high prevalence of MRI-detected osteoarthri- tis features in knees with no X-ray evidence of the disease.\"why some people experience milder forms of the dis- ease than others. This study, which is the largest to date of brains specific to Huntington's disease, is the product of a nearly 30-year collaboration between the lead inves- tigators at BuSM and their colleagues at the McLean Brain Tissue r esource Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Columbia university. Investigators examined 664 autopsy brain samples with HD that were donated to the McLean Brain Bank. They discovered that HD primarily dam- ages the brain in two areas and identified extraordi- nary variation in the extent of cell death in different brain regions. \"There are tremendous differences in how people with Huntington's disease are affected,\" said richard Myers, PhD, BuSM professor of neu-rology and the study's lead/ corresponding author. \"Some people with the disease have more difficulty with motor control than with their cognitive function, while others suffer more from cognitive disability than motor control issues.\" When studying these differences, the investiga- tors noted that the cell death in the striatum is heavily driven by the effects of variations in the Huntington gene itself, while effects on the cortex were mini-mally affected by the HD gene and are thus likely to be a consequence of other, unidentified causes. Importantly, the study showed that some people with HD experienced remarkably less neuronal cell death than others. \"While there is just one genetic defect that causes Huntington's disease, the disease affects dif - ferent parts of the brain in very different ways in dif - ferent people,\" said Myers. \"For the first time, we can measure these differences with a very fine level of detail and hopefully identify what is preventing brain cell death in some individuals with HD.\" This research was supported by the national Institute of neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Jerry McDonald Huntington's Disease r esearch Fund. n Adenosine r eceptor's r ole in regulating high-f at, diet-Induced obesity and t ype 2 diabetes BuSM researchers have demonstrated that the a2b-type adenosine receptor, a2bar, plays a significant role in the regulation of high-fat, high-cholesterol, diet-induced symptoms of type 2 diabetes. The find-ings, which are published online in PLOS ONE, also identify a2bar as a potential target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Diets that are high in fat and cholesterol induce changes in how the body regulates blood glucose levels. Exercise induces an increased production of adenosine, a metabolite produced naturally by cells. a2bar, a naturally occurring protein receptor found in the cell membrane, is activated by adenosine. This receptor is known to play an important role in regu- lating inflammation, which is associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity. a novel link also was identified between the expression of a2bar, insulin receptor substrate 2 (IrS-2), and insulin signaling. The results showed that the level of IrS-2, a protein that has previously been shown to mediate the effect of insulin, was impaired in tissues of the experimental model lacking a2bar, causing higher concentrations of blood glucose. When a2bar was activated in the control group using a pharmacologic agent with a diet high in fat and cholesterol, the level of IrS-2 was upregulated, lowering blood glucose. \"The pharmacologic activation of a2bar demon- strated its newly identified role in signaling down to regulate the levels of IrS-2, which then improved the signs of high-fat, diet-induced type 2 diabetes,\" said katya ravid, DSc/PhD, BuSM professor of medicine and biochemistry and director of the Evans Center for Interdisciplinary Biomedical r esearch at BuSM, who led this study. \"Our work suggests the important role of a2bar in maintaining the level of IrS-2, a regula- tor of glucose and insulin homeostasis.\" This study was funded in part by the national Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. n mrI use in osteoarthritis Studied a BuSM study shows that magnetic resonance imag-ing detected a high prevalence of abnormalities asso- ciated with knee osteoarthritis in middle-aged and elderly patients that had no evidence of knee osteo-arthritis in X-ray images. Prior studies have shown that only half of those with knee pain will have X-ray evidence of osteoar - thritis. This study looked at how to further evaluate a patient's knee pain if X-rays don't show evidence of osteoarthritis. It also looked at whether MrI, in these cases, is of clinical value. \"This data demonstrates a very high preva- lence of MrI-detected osteoarthritis features in knees with no X-ray evidence of the disease,\" said ali Guermazi, MD, PhD, BuSM professor of radiol- ogy and chief of Musculoskeletal Imaging at Boston Medical Center, who led this study in collaboration with researchers from Lund university in Sweden, Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and klinikum a ugsburg in Germany. The findings are published online in BMJ. The researchers note that MrI would be too expensive to perform as a routine imaging investigation. This research study was supported by grants from the national Institute on aging, the national Institute of arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, and the arthritis Foundation. n overdose e ducation and Nasal Naloxone distribution f ound to r educe opioid overdose deaths T raining bystanders to recognize and respond to drug overdoses can significantly reduce the number of fatalities, finds a study published online at BMJ. a team of researchers from BuSM, BuSPH, and BMC, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH), set out to evaluate the impact of overdose education and nal-oxone distribution (OEnD) programs between 2006 and 2009. OEnD programs train drug users, their families and friends, and potential bystanders to prevent, recognize, and respond to opioid overdoses. OEnD participants are trained to recognize signs of over - dose, seek help, rescue breathe, use naloxone (a drug that reverses the effects of opioid overdose), and stay with victims. From 1996 to 2010, over 50,000 potential bystanders were trained by OEnD programs in the united States, resulting in more than 10,000 opioid overdose rescues, but their impact on death rates and hospital use had not been examined in con-trolled studies. after adjusting for factors such as age, sex, eth- nicity, poverty, \"doctor shopping\" for prescription opioids, and addiction treatment, researchers found a significant reduction in opioid-related overdose deaths in communities where OEnD was imple-mented compared with those where it was not. There appeared to be a dose-related impact, where the higher the cumulative rate of OEnD implemen-tation, the greater the reduction in death rates. \"This study provides observational evidence that by training potential bystanders to prevent, recognize, and respond to opioid overdoses, OEnD is an effec- tive public intervention,\" the study concludes. n New drug t arget for multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease Led by Carmela abraham, PhD, professor of bio- chemistry, along with Cidi Chen, PhD, and other collaborators, BuSM researchers report that the protein klotho plays an important role in the health of myelin, the insulating material allowing for the rapid communication between nerve cells. These findings, which appear online in the Journal of Neuroscience, may lead to new therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) and alzheimer's disease ( aD), in which white matter abnormalities are also common but have been largely ignored. In MS, the myelin is attacked by the immune sys- tem and may not be completely restored by myelin-producing cells (mature oligodendrocytes). The researchers discovered that the addition of klotho protein to immature oligodendrocytes causes them to mature and manufacture proteins needed for the production of healthy myelin. \"These results, taken together, indicate that klotho could become a drug target for multiple scle-rosis and other white matter diseases, including aD,\" explained abraham. abraham and her colleagues have identified, and are working on optimizing, a number of small molecules that could form the basis for the develop-ment of therapeutic drugs, which would increase the amount of klotho protein in the brain. as shown by other research groups, since klotho is not only an age but also a tumor suppressor, interventions with klotho-enhancing drugs may solve some of the most treatment-resistant human ailments. Funding for this study was provided by grants from the national Institute on aging and the alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation. n Abraham and her colleagues have identified, and are work - ing on optimiz - ing, a number of small mol-ecules that could form the basis for the development of therapeutic drugs, which would increase the amount of Klotho protein in the brain. From 1996 to 2010, over 50,000 poten - tial bystanders were trained by OEND pro-grams in the United States, resulting in more than 10,000 opioid overdose rescues.20 Campus & Alumni News | BOSTOn unIVErSITY School of Medicine Spring 2013 | www.bumc.bu.edu 21to incorporating public health into emergency medicine with a special focus on interventions to reduce substance abuse.

Draper Laboratory, a not-for-profit engineering research and development organization dedicated to solv - ing national problems in national security, space systems, biomedical systems, and facultyNews Awards Benjamin Wolozin, phd , BuSM professor of pharmacology and neurology, Nugent, phd , BuSM professor of biochemistry, ophthalmology and biomedical engineering, have been awarded grants from the american Health assistance Foundation ( aHaF) to study age-related degenerative diseases. This marks the first time in more than a decade that BuSM has received an aHaF grant. The aHaF is a nonprofit organization that funds early-stage research on alzheimer's disease. The foundation seeks to eradicate age-related degenerative diseases by advanc-ing research seeking causes, prevention, treat - ment, and cures; promoting positive behaviors to combat these diseases; and facilitating the public's efforts to assist those who are affected. Wolozin was awarded a two-year, $150,000 grant to research rna binding proteins (rBPs) in alzheimer's disease. rBPs regulate the conversion of messenger rna into protein through the formation of complexes called rna granules. Cellular stresses induce formation of a particular type of complex, termed stress granules (SG). By examining SGs, Wolozin has identified a new conse- quence of alzheimer's disease. In this project he will investigate how these SGs might con- tribute to the causes of the disease.nugent, who was awarded a two-year, $100,000 grant, will degen- eration. growth factor (VEGF), a protein that stimulates blood vessel growth, has been shown to be a major cause of unwanted vessel growth into the retina in wet age-related macular degenera- tion ( aMD), a disease of the retina that is the leading cause of blindness in americans age 65 and older. The wet, or more elevated, form of this disease accounts for 90 percent of all blindness from aMD. nugent and his team propose to identify new ways that VEGF activ - ity is naturally controlled by interactions with the protein fibronectin, so that this pathway can be targeted for a more effective treatment for wet aMD. honors Gregory Antoine, md , BuSM associate pro- fessor of surgery and otolaryngology and chief of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Boston Medical Center (BMC), was elected to the national Medical association (nMa ) Board of T rustees.

Every year at medical schools across the country, Match Day fills the air with anticipation and excitement. With the countdown complete and cameras flashing, these doctors-in-waiting learned of their residency placements. Kathleen Bennett, md '84, assistant professor of medicine in the Section of General Internal Medicine, died november 23, 2012, after a long battle with breast cancer. a BuSM alumna of the Class of 1984 and a member of the BuSM faculty since 1989, Dr. Bennett was a leader in health care adminis- tration at the neighborhood Health Plan, Boston Medical Center Healthnet Plan, and, most recently, as chief medical officer at Senior Whole Health. She also had a primary care practice at upham's Corner Health Center, where she'd cared for patients since her residency years. She completed her internship in family medicine at Cook County Hospital in Chicago and her internal medicine residency at the former Boston City Hospital (BCH), now Boston Medical Center, where she served as chief medi- cal resident. a fter completing her training, she served as assistant program director and later program director for the Department of Internal Medicine residency program and assistant director of medicine at BCH. Very highly regarded by her patients and colleagues, Dr. Bennett was an excellent clinician, a fierce patient advocate, and a gifted teacher. She gra-ciously shared the story of dealing with her cancer in Grand r ounds for the Department of Medicine, offering a rare and candid perspective of interacting with the medical system as a patient. She is survived by her life partner, Sharon Hanson, her mother, two brothers, and a sister.Addressing unhealthy Alcohol use in p rimary care (Springer, 2013) Editor: richard Saitz md , mph, f ACp , fASAm Professor of Medicine & EpidemiologyDirector, Clinical a ddiction r esearch and Education (C arE) unit Section of General Internal MedicineBoston university Schools of Medicine & Public Health While there is a wealth of published infor - mation on addiction medicine, the psy - chological aspects of alcohol abuse, and behavioral medicine with regard to addic-tion, virtually none of the existing resources were written with the primary care provider in mind. Addressing Unhealthy Alcohol Use in Primary Care is a reference for primary care clinicians who are confronted daily by patients with these problems and who wish to success-fully address these issues in their prac-tice. Focusing on the literature and science relevant to practicing providers, this book covers the range of interven-tions appropriate for this setting. T opics include assessment, brief counseling interventions, pharmaco-therapy, referrals to both specialty care and alcoholics anonymous (and other self-help programs), psychiatric co-morbidity and other drug use, and other information spe-cific to the needs of the primary care clini-cian. The vast majority of people with health risks and consequences related to alcohol use receive little to no attention from health care providers, despite the fact that alco-hol is a leading cause of early preventable death. This book is a guide to identifying and addressing unhealthy alcohol use in the hope of improving the lives of patients. energy, formed this consortium of nation- ally recognized PTSD experts to improve diagnostic tools and treatment outcomes for the disorder. rasmusson will lead the selection and development of methods for testing and measuring biomarkers from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or other sources that characterize the function of an indi- vidual's stress response system, both at rest and when activated by general or trauma-related stressors. Vasterling will lead the effort to integrate neurocognitive data, which includes measures such as memory, atten-tion, and other thinking skills that pertain to brain functioning. richard d . Wainford, phd , assistant pro- fessor in the Departments of Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics and Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, and a member of the Whitaker Cardiovascular Institute at BuSM, has been nominated as a Fellow of the american Heart association affiliated with the Council for High Blood Pressure r esearch for his professional accomplishments and outstanding basic science research in the field of hyperten- sion. Wainford was honored with other newly elected Fellows at the High Blood Pressure r esearch 2012 Scientific Session in Washington, DC. He also was selected as the recipient of the 2012 Dean Franklin Y oung Investigator a ward by the american Physiological Society ( aPS), which recog- nized him at the Experimental Biology annual meeting. as the recipient, Wainford received an institutional grant providing BuSM with a $20,000 Data Sciences International Instrumentation Starter kit. Wainford joined the BuSM faculty in September of 2011. His research focuses on the central neural control of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and blood pressure regulation. The major goal of his research is identifying the underlying pathophysiology of and potential treatments for hypertension. Current stud- ies concern the role of central G-alpha subunit protein gated pathways in mediating the neural control of kidney function and systemic arterial blood pressure. n In Memoriamfaculty news the smiles tell the story for Class of 2013 members who successfully matched at the hospitals of their choice.24 Campus & Alumni News | BOSTOn unIVErSITY School of Medicine Spring 2013 | www.bumc.bu.edu 25 \"T o complement the hospital-based sur - gery experience, I also spent a significant amount of time in the emergency department in a more hands-on capacity, shadowing doc-tors and interns, assisting with procedures, and suturing patients when necessary. There was one patient who came in following a car accident with a lacerated hand and arm. The cuts were so deep on his hand that his skin was hanging in flaps and his white tendons were bare. While an intern attended to the more serious portions, I sutured much of his hand and arm in the midst of a busy Er at three in the morning. \"although the clinical exposure was excel- lent, there was a relative dearth of funding, especially for free service hospitals like this one. Supplies and infrastructure were large issues; compared to how hospitals operate in the uS, they managed to function on a shoe- string budget. Many commonplace items, whose disposable versions would be routinely discarded here, were sterilized and reused. \"Operating out of a modified van, the Cinterandes Mobile Surgery unit performs procedures in general, urological, gynecologi- cal, reconstructive, and ophthalmologic surgery in 17 of the 24 Ecuadorian provinces. The most salient and rewarding portion of my clini- cal placements was the mobile surgery trip. We traveled to the town of El Guabo and in the span of three days, performed 18 surger - ies within the confines of our van. In addition to placing IV lines, applying local anesthetics, inducing general anesthesia, monitoring vitals, and maintaining the surgical suite, I was able to scrub in, assist, and close on my share of the surgeries. My fellow students and I were also entrusted with the postoperative care of our respective patients, which included speaking to their family members. Family and commu- nity are very important in Ecuador, and most patients had a constant stream of visitors. Grateful for our efforts, the community center provided us with enormous amounts of food\u2014 whether it was a snack between procedures or scheduled meals throughout the day\u2014and a celebratory event on our final night. Their warmth and sincerity was a common theme in many of my interactions with local community members, in contrast to the sometimes stilted customs and mannerisms back in the uS. It was the most culturally and clinically enriching experience of my entire trip.\" n \"It was a short three-and-a-half years ago that the faculty welcomed you to the study of medicine at the White Coat Ceremony, and we look forward to welcoming you to the practice of medicine at Commencement,\" said Dean karen antman, MD. \"Y ou have matched from new Hampshire to Hawaii and Canada to T exas, and the good news is that we get to keep 15 of you here at Boston Medical Center. Congratulations on all of your hard work and achievements.\" T wenty-three percent of the class will enter internal medicine residency; 11 percent in family medicine, and 10 percent each in pediatrics and obstetrics and gynecology. nine percent of the class will train in emergency medicine. acting for the first time in her capacity as associate dean for student affairs at a Match Day, angela Jackson, MD, told the class it was a privilege to share such an important event in their lives with them. a fter congratulating the class, Phyllis Carr, MD, former associate dean for student affairs, noted their special capacity for caring for each other and announced that the class had chosen Bill Hammond as their class speaker. \"On behalf of the 8,000 BuSM alumni across the country, I congratulate you on the successful completion of your medical education,\" said Jean ramsey, MD, associate dean for alumni affairs. \"We look forward to welcoming you to the BuSM alumni association at Commencement and getting to know you better as our colleagues and fellow graduates.\" n Brian Currie '15 spent five weeks in Ecuador last summer in an intensive program that provides health care to poor and medically disadvantaged communities in that country through the Cinterandes Foundation. The non- profit foundation promotes health and provides health care to some of Ecuardor's most disad-vantaged communities. \"Beyond the opportunities to rotate through hospitals and regional health clin-ics, what really caught my attention about this program was the Mobile Surgery unit,\" says Currie. \"When it came time to plan my sum-mer, this program was a clear choice\u2014it was an ideal fusion of my fascination with surgery, desire to improve my medical Spanish, and interest in making health care accessible to underserved patient populations. \"I chose to spend five weeks in the Cinterandes program, thinking this would allow enough time to acclimate to the language and culture so I could make the most of my clini-cal experiences. However, I discovered during my first week at the hospital that there is a big leap between conversational acumen and pro-ficiency with medical terminology, even after two semesters of medical Spanish electives at Bu. They must have found my stumbling attempts endearing because I soon transi- tioned from being a lost dog that was permit - ted to tag along to an active participant. under their tutelage, coupled with my constant refer - ences to a Spanish/English dictionary, I eventu-ally got the hang of it. \"at the regional hospital I was able to observe approximately eight to 10 different procedures per day encompassing nearly the full spectrum of surgical interventions. One that stands out in my mind was an emergency Cesarean section for a woman who had been in labor for an entire week. although the details were sparse, I learned that her delay in coming to the hospital was simply out of necessity (travel issues, other responsibili-ties, etc.). I was stunned, even more so because the doctor explaining the case was entirely not surprised by the events.

The 57-year-old with a salt-and- pepper beard and a broken nose has strug- gled with alcoholism and drug abuse since he was a teen and suffered from seizures since he was in an accident at the age of 25. and, he's still recovering from being hit by a car two years ago. Medical issues like these would spell misery for anyone, but for homeless people, a group whose mortality rate is at least four times that of the general population, the mis-ery is compounded. Savory considers himself lucky, however, in one regard: he is treated regularly at the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP), which is staffed in part by first- and second-year School of Medicine student volunteers. \"Every time I've been here, every time I leave, I be all right,\" Savory says slowly, his brow furrowing as he sits in a BHCHP exam room. Savory was one of several patients examined late one night by BuSM students enrolled in the Homeless Health Immersion Experience, a noncredit, service-learning program started last spring by two medical students interested in gaining early clinical experience and exposure to a vastly under - served population. \"Bu medical students don't really have much experience with the homeless popula- tion,\" says raagini Jawa '14, who cofounded the elective program with alec Peniche '14. \"This is a great way for them to understand a different subset of ailments and issues.\" Jawa and Peniche developed the program with Suzanne Sarfaty, MD '88, BuSM assistant dean of academic affairs and director of inter - national health programs and an associate pro- fessor, and with BHCHP doctors Jennifer Brody, MD, and Mardge Cohen, MD, who agreed to supervise the students. The pilot program was launched last spring, with 12 first-year and 12 second-year students working in pairs and rotating through an outpatient clinic and a respite center on a monthly basis. While the first group gained valuable patient interviewing skills, the second practiced physical examination techniques and acted as friendly mentors to their less-expe-rienced peers. a fter each exam, the students presented a patient's case to Brody or Cohen, who gave them pointers on technique and explained how homelessness influenced the patients' medical conditions. Since the full-fledged program launched in September, Jawa and Peniche have expanded it to include BHCHP-affiliated medical resi- dents who give mini-lectures to students about issues related to homelessness and health care. The cofounders also partnered with the BuSM student-run Outreach Van Project, a mobile unit that serves the homeless popula- tion once a week in East Boston. The Boston Public Health Commission reports that in 2011, nearly 6,650 people were homeless in Boston, and just over half of them were single adults living on the street, in shel-ters, in transitional housing, or in treatment facilities. James O'Connell, MD, the BuSM assistant professor of medicine who founded BHCHP in 1984, puts the number higher; he believes that 25,000 Bostonians are homeless for some period of time each year. His organi-zation serves more than 11,000 people a year through street outreach or at its albany Street headquarters, which has a pharmacy, a den-tal office, an outpatient clinic, and a 104-bed medical respite center. Hours after closing time for most doc- tors, Cohen sits in a BHCHP exam room with three medical students who just saw their first patients. \"The idea was for you to feel comfortable learning about someone who has a lot of vulnerabilities,\" she says. Medicine with a Mission MED students team up with Boston Health Care for the Homeless \"knowing how to care for, and care about, the most vulnerable attests to the type of person you are. Many medical students do not want to take care of such people. Y ou will see that it's an incredibly gratifying experi- ence.\" Cohen then asks the students to pre- sent their patients' cases. nahiris Bahamon '15 and Stephanie Donatelli '15 take turns describing the condi-tion of a 46-year-old male. He's a self-described alcoholic with neuropathy, acid reflux, arthritis, and a long history of personal tragedy. Both his parents were alcoholics. One brother, a drug user, died of aIDS. another died of cirrhosis. His firstborn died of SIDS. He has a history of depression and anxiety, and although he'd been sober for two years, he wants to return to detox after a recent relapse. \"He's very self-aware,\" Donatelli says. \"We didn't even have to ask that many questions.\" Cohen laughs. \"Y our empathy shows, which is very important,\" she says. \"He elicits that in us.\" She discusses the impact personal trauma has on health, the genetics of alcohol-ism, and the post-traumatic stress disorder the patient likely suffers from because of his child's early death. \"Do you think that could be someone you know?\" she asks. \"Or do you think it happened to him because it was going to happen?\" Bahamon reviews the patient's complicated life history and suggests that \"he was set up for failure.\" Donatelli agrees, adding that each time he rallied, something beyond his control knocked him down. Cohen emphasizes the importance of being there for a patient when he falls, as many times as he falls, and to look for small victories in his daily life\u2014like the desire to get treatment for alcoholism. \"Hopefully he'll go into a program and stay,\" she says. across the hall in another exam room, Savory is pleased to have a warm meal and a place to stay for the next few days. He's uncan- nily calm about the ill turns his life has taken and draws from a deep well of faith\u2014something he says his grandmother instilled in him as a kid attending church every Sunday. n This article first appeared in Bu T oday.raagini Jawa '14 (center) and Sai k onda '15 examine Sampson Samuel, a Boston Health Care for the Homeless patient. The Boston Public Health Commission reports that in 2011, nearly 6,650 people were homeless in Boston, and just over half of them were single adults living on the street, in shelters, in transitional housing, or in treatment facilities. The Hiebert Lounge was filled with posters on February 6, as the annual Medical Student Summer r esearch Program (MSSrP) sympo- sium was held to showcase student research. Students received awards for the best basic science, clinical science, and medical educa- tion research posters. The MSSrP offers first-year Boston university medical students scholarships to complete eight-week research projects with a Bu MC faculty member. During the sum- mer of 2012, 27 students participated in the program. \"The MSSrP supports students who want to engage in rigorous research that enriches their academic and clinical experiences,\" says Suzanne Sarfaty, MD '88, assistant dean for academic affairs and the program's direc- tor. \"Many of these students go on to pub-lish their research or present it at national meetings.\" The awards are named in honor of Jerome Serchuck, a longtime MSSrP donor who has given generously to the program since its official establishment in the sum-mer of 2000, when 15 members of the BuSM Class of 2003 undertook research in vari- ous Bu MC departments. The first Serchuck awards were presented in 2007 and the pro- gram continues to flourish as a direct result of his ongoing support and generosity. \"We are deeply grateful to the Serchuck family for their continued, generous commit - ment to the program and the advancement of our medical students,\" said Sarfaty. \" also key to the success of the program is the support of departments and the dedicated work of faculty who guide the research\u2014this program would not be possible without them.\" arthur Stucchi, PhD, research associate professor in the Department of Surgery, has mentored more than 25 medical students since 1998. \"The MSSrP affords students the opportunity to broaden their critical and analytical thinking skills and to gain a deeper appreciation of the importance of the medical and scientific literature in making informed decisions,\" he says.

Walsh Memorial Student Achievement Award, established by the depart - ment to honor the memory of Dr. Walsh, a 20-year member of physi-ology and biophysics who died un-expectedly in 2004. A biochemist, Walsh was the soul of the graduate program. She was a student advisor and mentor, and also a protector and friend; her wisdom, patience, and guidance were invaluable to both students and faculty alike. Third-year BuSM student Francis kim has been named a recipient of the american Medical association ( aMa ) Foundation's 2013 Leadership a ward. r ecipients are recog- nized for demonstrating outstanding nonclini-cal leadership skills in advocacy, community service, and education. The award provides medical students, residents/fellows, and early career physicians from around the country with special training to develop their skills as future leaders in medicine and community affairs. kim plans to pursue a surgical career that combines clinical practice, research, and health policy; his interests are in health care disparities and quality improvement. While at BuSM, kim has been active with the american Medical association and the Massachusetts Medical Society, serving as chapter cochair, authoring several resolutions, and participating in national and statewide community service projects. as a college student at Harvard university, kim served as a program coordinator for the Health Leads' Boston-based STrIVE program, which mentors and advocates for inner-city adolescents with sickle cell disease. While conducting research for his master's thesis, he served as the r esearch Fellow in Operation Smile's weeklong inaugural burns mission trip to Mumbai, India, which provided no-cost reconstructive surgeries to burn patients from the slums of Mumbai. Published in peer- reviewed literature, kim's ongoing research focuses on determining effective and sustain- able measures to decrease global burn morbid- ity and mortality. \"We are proud to have students who are committed to community service and to patients locally and globally,\" said Dean karen antman, MD. \"This is a great honor.\" n Stephanie Wong and her mentor, dr.

They have also funded a scholar - ship at the School and recently established a charitable remainder trust to benefit the new student residence on campus. \"Medical school is very expensive now,\" says Doug. \"We must continue to train good doctors, and if our donations can help in any small way to offset some of this cost, we are grateful. Doctors need to concentrate on being good physicians and not constantly worry about their future because of financial commit - ments over which they have had no control. \"T o have a student residence is about as good as it can get for a medical student. They can now live on campus, close to class and the hospital. They can enjoy socializing with other students while in an atmosphere where studies are important to everyone.\" The Barnards met each other at the first BuSM social event held for incoming medical students. They got married within the year and had a baby daughter the next. \"Six months later Donna lost her dad and her financial support,\" recalls Doug. \"My dad was supporting a son at Dartmouth, as he had supported me at Washington & Lee university. He could not afford to support both medical school and college tuitions. a t this point we were on our own financially. \"With the medical school's backing, we decided to take a year off, earn some money, and try to come back the following year to complete our education. BuSM helped both of us obtain jobs within the medical community\u2014we organized babysitting as best we could and were able to return to school the following year. at that point, we still needed financial help. The School was more than willing to work with us and gave us scholarships and loans that allowed us to continue.\" The couple went on to graduate and com- plete their internships as well as have a second child, a son. T o this day, they're not sure how they made it through that internship year. \"When we were in trouble financially and emotionally with our own lives, BuSM provided guidance and support for us,\" Donna says. \"apparently they saw two struggling young medical students who were willing to sacrifice themselves with a purpose in mind. They gave us the opportunity to succeed.\" Following his internship, Doug completed an anesthesia residency at the Chelsea naval Hospital and then spent a year in Vietnam with the Marines. upon returning home, he contin-ued as a staff anesthesiologist at Chelsea naval Hospital, and Donna entered a three-year oncology and hematology fellowship at BuSM. Seven years after graduation from medical school and with their training complete, Donna helped to found a practice with an oncology hematology group and Doug left the navy and moved to private practice north of Boston. \"T o give something back is very important to both of us,\" says Doug. \"When we give to BuSM, we know the money is being used for a worthwhile purpose, and one that we can relate to. This is not true of many charities.\" \"We are forever grateful for the help we received from BuSM,\" Donna adds. \"It took us ten years to pay back the loans. now we can give some scholarship aid to other students who may share our goals. The planned gift is a way to assure us of a small annuity for our lifetime and to be sure BuSM is the eventual recipient of our gift.\" \"The Barnards have never forgotten what it is like to struggle to achieve personal and professional goals,\" notes Dean karen antman, MD. \"BuSM was there for them at a crucial time in their lives, and they returned that early sup- port many times over in the following decades. The School of Medicine and our students are truly fortunate for the outstanding generosity of this dedicated alumni couple.\" n For more information on making a planned gift contact: BUSM Development Office at busmdev@bu.edu or 617-638-4570 or www.bu.edu/ supportingbusm.
