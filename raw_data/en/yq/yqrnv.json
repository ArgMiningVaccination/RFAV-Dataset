Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 2 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 Introduction: Section 4901 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA ), public law 105- 33amended the Social Security Act (the Act) by adding a n ew title XXI, th e Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP ). In February 2009, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) renewed the program . The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 further modified the program . This template outlines the information that must be included in the state plans and the state plan amendments ( SPAs ). It reflects the regulatory requirements at 42 CFR P art 457as well as the previously approved SPA templates that accompanied guidance issued to States th rough State Health Official (SHO) letters . Where applicable, we indicate the SHO number and the date it was issued for your reference . The CHIP SPA template includes the following changes: Combined the instruction document with the CHIP SPA template to ha ve a single document. Any modifications to previous instructions are for clarification only and do not reflect new policy guidance. Incorporated the previously issued guidance and templates (see the Key following the template for information on the newly a dded templates) , including: Prenatal care and associated health care services (SHO #02 -004, issued November 12, 2002) Coverage of pregnant women (CHIPRA #2, SHO # 09- 006, issued May 11, 2009) Tribal consultation requirements (ARRA #2, CHIPRA #3, issued May 28, 2009) Dental and supplemental dental benefits (CHIPRA # 7, SHO # #09- 012, issued October 7, 2009) Premium assistance (CHIPRA # 13, SHO # 10- 002, issued February 2, 2010) Express lane eligibility (CHIPRA # 14, SHO # 10 -003, issued February 4, 2010) Lawfully Residing requirements (CHIPRA # 17, SHO # 10- 006, issued July 1, 2010) Moved sections 2.2 and 2.3 into section 5 to eliminate redundancies between sections 2 and 5. Removed crowd -out language that had been added by the August 17 letter that later was repealed. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is developing regulations to implement the CHIPRA requirements . When final regulations are published in the Federal Register, this template will be modified to reflect those rules and States will be required to submit SPAs illustrating compliance with the new regulations. States are not required to resubmit their State plans based on the updated template. However, States must use the updated template when submitting a State Plan Amendment. Federal Requirements for Submi ssion and Review of a Proposed SPA . (42 CFR Part 457 Subpart A) In order to be eligible for payment under this statute , each State must submit a Title XXI plan for approval by the Secretary that details how the State intends to use the funds and fulfill other requirements under the law and regulations at 42 C FR Part 457. A SPA is approved in 90 days unles s the Secretary notifies the State in writing that the plan is disapproved or that specified additional information is needed. Unlike Medicaid SPAs, there is only one 90- day review period, or clock for CHIP Spas, that may be stopped by a request for additional information and restarted after a complete Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 3 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 response is received . More information on the SPA review process is found at 42 CFR 457 Subpart A . When submitting a State plan amendment, states should r edline the ch anges that are being made to the existing Sta te plan and provide a \"clean\" copy including changes that are being made to the existing state plan. The template includes the following sections : 1. General Description and Purpose of the Children's Health Insura nce Plans and the Requirements - This section should describe how the State has designed their program . It also is the place in the template that a State updates to i nsert a short description and the proposed effective date of the SPA, and the proposed impl ementation date(s) if different from the effective date. (Section 2101) ;( 42 CFR 457.70) 2. General Background and Description of State Approach to Child Health Coverage and Coordination - This section should provide general information related to the special characteristics of each state's program. The information should include the extent and manner to which children in the State currently have creditable health coverage, current State efforts to provide or obtain creditable health coverage for uninsured chil dren and how the plan is designed to be coordinated with current health insurance, public health efforts, or other enrollment initiatives . This information provides a health insurance baseline in terms of the status of the children in a given State and the State programs currently in place. (Section 2103); (42 CFR 457.410(A)) 3. Methods of Delivery and Utilization Controls - This section requires a description that must include both proposed methods of delivery and proposed utilization control systems . This sec tion should fully describe the delivery system of the Title XXI program including the proposed contracting standards, the proposed delivery systems and the plans for enrolling providers. (Section 2103); (42 CFR 457.410(A)) 4. Eligibility Standards and Methodology- The plan must include a description of the standards used to determine the eligibility of targeted low -income children for child health assistance under the plan . This section includes a list of potential eligibility standards the State can check off and provide a short description of how those standards will be applied. All eligibility standards must be consistent with the provisions of Title XXI and may not discriminate on the basis of diagnosis . In addition, if the standards vary within the state, the State should describe how they will be applied and under what circumstances they will be applied. In addition, this section provides information on income eligibility for Medicaid expansion programs (which are exempt from Section 4 of the State plan te mplate) if applicable. (Section 2102(b)); (42 CFR 457.305 and 457.320) 5. Outreach - This section is designed for the State to fully explain its outreach activities . Outreach is defined in law as outreach to families of children likely to be eligible for child health assistance under the plan or under other public or private health coverage programs . The purpose is to inform these families of the availability of, and to assist them in enrolling their children in, such a pro gram. (Section 2102(c)(1)); (42CFR 457.90) 6.

In this section States identify the scope of coverage and benefits offered under the plan including the categories under which that coverage is offered . The amount, scope, and duration of each offered service should be fully explained, as well as any corresponding limitations or exclusions. (Section 2103); (42 CFR 457.410(A)) 7. Quality and Appropriateness of Care- This section includes a description of the methods (including monitoring) to be used to assure the quality and appropriateness of care and to assure access to covered services . A variety of methods are available for State's use in monitoring and evaluating the quality and appropriateness of care in its child health assistance program . The section lists some of the methods which states may consider usi ng. In addition to methods, there are a variety of tools available for State adaptation and use wit h this program . The section lists some of these tools . States also have the option to choose who will conduct these activities . As an alternative to using staff of the State agency administering the program, states have the option to contract out with othe r organizations for this quality of care function. (Section 2107); (42 CFR 457.495) 8. Cost Sharing and Payment - This section addresses the requirement of a State child health plan to include a description of its proposed cost sharing for enrollees .

Strategic Objectives and Performance Goals and Plan Administration - The section addresses the strategic objectives, the performance goals, and the performance measures the State has established for providing child health assistance to targeted low income children under the plan for maximizing health benefits coverage for other low income children and children generally in the state. (Section 2107); (42 CFR 457.710) 10. Annual Reports and Evaluations - Section 2108(a) requires the State to assess the operation of the Children's Health Insurance Program plan and submit to the Secretary an annual report which includes the progress made in reducing the number of uninsured low income children. The report is due by January 1, following the end of the Fede ral fiscal year and should cover that Federal Fiscal Year. In this section, states are asked to assure that they will comply with these requirements, indicated by checking the box. (Section 2108); (42 CFR 457.750) 11. Program Integrity - In this section, the State assures that services are provided in an effective and efficient manner through free and open competition or through basing rates on other public and private rates that are actuarially sound. (Sections 2101(a) and 2107(e); (42 CFR 457, subpart I) 12. Applicant and Enrollee Protections - This section addresses the review process for eligibility and enrollment matters, health services matters (i.e., grievances), and for states that use premium assistance a description of how it will assure that applicants and enrollees are given the oppor tunity at initial enrollment and at each redetermination of eligibility to obtain health Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 5 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 benefits coverage other than through that group health plan. (Section 2101(a)); (42 CFR 457.1120) Program Options . As mentioned above, the law allows S tates to expand coverage for children through a separate child health insurance program, through a Medicaid expansion program, or through a combination of these programs . These options are described further below : Option to Create a Separate Program - States may elect to establish a separate child health program that are in compliance with title XXI and applicable rules . These states must establish enrollment systems that are coordinated with Medicaid and other sources of health coverage for children and also must screen c hildren during the application process to determine if they are eligible for Medicaid and, if they are, enroll these children promptly in Medicaid. Option to Expand Medicaid- States may elect to expand coverage through Medicaid . This option for states would be available for children who do not qualify for Medicaid under State rules in effect as of March 31, 1997. Under this option, current Medicaid rules would apply. Medicaid Expansion- CHIP SPA Requirements In order to expedite the SPA process, states choosing to expand coverage only through an expansion of Medicaid eligibility would be required to complete sections: 1 (General Description) 2 (General Background) They will also be required to complete the appropriate progr am sections, including: 4 (Eligibility Standards and Methodology) 5 (Outreach) 9 (Strategic Objectives and Performance Goals and Plan Administration including the budget) 10 (Annual Reports and Evaluations) . Medicaid Expansion- Medicaid SPA Requirements States expanding through Medicaid -only will also be required to submit a Medicaid State Plan Amendment to modify their Title XIX State plans. These states may complete the first check -off and indicate that the description of the requirements for these sect ions are incorporated by reference through their State Medicaid plans for sections: 3 (Methods of Delivery and Utilization Controls) 4 (Eligibility Standards and Methodology) 6 (Coverage Requirements for Children' s Health Insurance) 7 (Quality and Appropriateness of Care) 8 (Cost Sharing and Payment) 11 (Program Integrity) 12 (Applicant and Enrollee Protections) Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 6 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 Combination of Options -CHIP allows states to elect to use a combination of the Medicaid program and a separate child health program to i ncrease health coverage for children . For example, a State may cover optional targeted -low income children in families with incomes of up to 133 percent of poverty through Medicaid and a targeted group of children above that level through a separate child health program . For the children the State chooses to cover under an expansion of Medicaid, the description provided under \" Option to Expand Medicaid\" would apply . Similarly, for children the State chooses to cover under a separate program, the provi sions outlined above in \"Option to Create a Separate Program\" would apply. States wishing to use a combination of approaches will be required to complete the Title XXI State plan and the necessary State plan amendment under Title XIX. Proposed State plan amendments should be submitted electronically and one signed hard copy to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services at the following address: Name of Project Officer Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 7500 Security Blvd Baltimore, Maryland 21244 Attn: Children and Adults Health Programs Group Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services Mail Stop - S2-01-16 Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 7 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 Section 1 .

THESE NUMBERS WILL NOT BE USED AS A BASIS FOR THE ALLOTMENT . Factors that the State may consider in the provision of this information are age breakouts, income brackets, definitions of insurability, and geographic location, as well as race and ethnicity . The State should describe its information sources and the assumptions it uses for the development of its description. Population Number of uninsured Race demographics Age Demographics Info per region/Geographic information 2.1. Describe the extent to which, and manner in which, children in the State ( including targeted low -income children and other groups of children specified ) identified , by income level and other relevant factors, such as race, ethnicity and geographic locat ion, currently have creditable health coverage (as defined in 42 CFR 457.10) . To the extent feasible, distinguish between creditable coverage under public health insurance programs and public -private partnerships (See Section 10 for annual report requirements) . (Section 2102(a)(1)); (42 CFR 457.80(a)) Prior to CHIP, the only two programs offering health insurance to low -income children Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 16 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 were Medicaid and the Alabama Child Caring Foundation (ACCF). Medicaid served children at the minimum income levels requ ired by federal law. This meant that Medicaid coverage was available to children at three different levels of income and age: - Those under the age of six (6) years with incomes up to 133% FPL; - Those children six (6) through 14 years of age who were bor n after September 30, 1983 with incomes up to 100%FPL; and, - Those remaining children through the age of 18 years (middle and older teens) with incomes at the TANF assistance level (below approximately 13% FPL). The ACCF served children (birth through 18 years) with incomes from the Medicaid levels up to 200% FPL. From February 2, 1998 through September 30, 2002, Phase I of CHIP, a Medicaid expansion was in existence. On October 1, 2002, Phase I of Alabama's CHIP was subsumed by the Alabama SOBRA Medicaid Program . Beginning October 1, 2015, however, children in this category (ages 14 to 19 with incomes between 13% FPL and 141% FPL) will again be enrolled in a CHIP Medicaid expansion. Originally, CHIP used a baseline number of uninsured chil dren derived from the Current Population Survey (CPS). This baseline including the following chart was derived from a study by Winterbottom et.al. based on a three year merged Current Population Survey, or CPS, (1990- 92), which showed over 200,000 childre n, in Alabama, under 18 years to be uninsured. Employer Medicaid Other Coverage Uninsured Percent 59.3 17.2 5.1 18.4 Number 652,300 189,200 110,000 202,400 However, due to concerns about the CPS regarding potential problems with subjects' abilities to recall information, Alabama changed its baseline estimate to reflect data from the 1997 round of the Urban Institute's National Survey of America's Families (NSAF). The NSAF indicated that there were 173,012 uninsured children in Alabama. Of these, 91,209 were < 100% Federal Poverty Level (FPL), 49,579 were above 100 up to 200% FPL and 32,223 were >200% FPL. In its first 4 years of implementation (October 1, 1998 - September 30, 2002), Phase II, ALL Kids, enrolled over 80,000 children. It is estimated that 52,000 children have current enrollment in ALL Kids at the end of FY 2002. ALL Kids PLUS, added as a third amendment to the CHIP State Plan (October, 1999), serves as a mechanism by which children with special health care needs/conditions (CSHCN/C), who are enrolled in ALL Kids, may receive health and health related services which are beyond the Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 17 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 scope of the basic ALL Kids package. ALL Kids PLUS was designed so that it serves as a funding source for CHIP state match and as a funding mechanism for state agencies who serve CSHCN/C with state funds. State agencies participating in ALL Kids PLUS supply the s tate match, provide the service, and receive full reimbursement. It was originally estimated that approximately 9% of these enrollees would also receive at least one service under ALL Kids PLUS. However because the basic benefit package is so comprehens ive, a much lower percentage of children are receiving PLUS services. It is expected that this percentage will increase as more state agencies contract with CHIP to become ALL Kids PLUS providers. With the advent of ALL Kids, the ACCF has changed its income eligibility criteria to serve children who are not eligible for Medicaid or ALL Kids and who have incomes up to 235% FPL. Because, the ACCF has no enrollment restriction regarding immigrants, this program has seen a dramatic increase in its Hispanic enrollment. Guidance: Section 2.2allows states to request to use the funds available under the 10 percent limit on administrative expenditures in order to fund services not otherwise allowable. The health services initiatives must meet the requirements of 42 CFR 457.10. 2.2. Health Services Initiatives -Describe if the State will use the health services initiative option as allowed at 42 CFR 457.10. If so, describe what services or programs the State is proposing to cover with administrative funds, including the cost of each program, and how it is currently funded (if applicable ), also update the budget accordingly . (Section 2105(a )(1)(D )(ii)); (42 CFR 457.10) As permitted under section 2105(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Social Security Act and federal regulations at 42 CFR 457.10, the State of Alabama is implementing a health services initiative (HSI) that will use CHIP funds, within the federal administrative expenditures cap allowed for states, to support the Reducing Infant Mortality (RIM) Health Services Initiative. The aim of this initiative is to reduce the infant mortality rate in selected counties within Alabama through the provision of a variety of evidence -based case management services for pregnant women and c hildren. These case management services will target health, social, and behavioral health related high -risk factors which have been shown to impact pregnancy outcomes and infant health. Case Management services will connect patients , with high -risk factors , to appropriate services and case managers will follow -up to ensure that risk factors are being addressed satisfactorily. It is anticipated that the case manager will make a total of 6 face to face visits. Three visits would occur during the prenatal care, and three visits would be provided post -delivery . The care coordination services provided postpartum including services to the infant include: i. Make home visit within one month following delivery to complete the foll owing: 1. Encourage patient to keep postpartum appointment including providing appointment reminders to help ensure completion of the postpartum appointment. 2. Encourage patient to choose a reliable birth control method. If the patient has chosen Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 18 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 sterilization as her method, follow -up with the patient to ensure the procedure is completed. 3. Ensure patient is established with a PMP for the infant. 4. Ensure infant has enrolled in WIC, if eligible. 5. Educate the patien t on the importance of immunizations for the infant. ii. Assist in scheduling appointments with infant's PMP up to the first year to ensure that well baby checkups are made and immunizations are up to date. Follow up after the appointments to ve rify that appointments were kept. Well Baby checkups are scheduled at: a. 1 month b. 2 months c. 4 months d. 6 months e. 9 months f. 12 months iii. Promote the child's overall physical, cognitive, and emotional d evelopment through educating parents/caregivers about developmental milestones according to the child's age and developmental abilities. iv. Complete an ASQ -3 (Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Third Edition, a developmental screening tool) as appropriate at face to face appointments. v. Educate the parents about the importance of reading to the infant to promote cognitive development. vi. Make referrals for the child, as appropriate, such as Early Intervention, Children's Rehabilitation Services, etc. vii. Prior to the child's first birthday, ensure he/she is established with a dentist. viii. Screen the mother for post -partum depression at each face to face visit and make referrals and follow up (as needed) With the exception of providing necessary prenatal monitoring by a nurse in the home or health department setting, no HSI funds will be spent on direct care. The high- risk factors that HSI will address include the following: ACEs Score of >4 Depression 1 Diabetes Mellitus Current multiple bir ths Substance Abuse2 Maternal age3 Hypertension Interpersonal safety Transportation needs Housing Instability Food Insecurity Utility needs Abuse4 Enrollment in CHIP unborn coverage Prior poor pregnancy outcome5 1 Depression noted at anytime during the pregnancy or postpartum period (90 days postpartum) 2 History of use or current substance use 3 <21 or >35 4 Emotional, physical, or sexual 5 Fetal Death - Stillbirth after 20 weeks; Infant death - first year of life; Preterm birth - <37 weeks gestation; Very - <1500 grams; Other serious chronic conditions (ex: heart disease, renal disease, chronic medical illnesses, etc.); and, Maternal Death (death of a woman while Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 19 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 To be eligible for the HSI, pregnant women and/or their infants in selected counties must have at least one of the high -risk factors cited above and have an income no greater than the upper CHIP limit (currently 312% FPL). HSI services will be offered wh ether or not the patient has health insurance coverage and regardless of the type of insurance. Case management services for individuals enrolled in Medicaid will be time -limited until the implementation of the case management services provided in the Ala bama Coordinated Health Network (ACHN) scheduled to begin October 1, 2019. Individuals with other insurance that are provided case management services will not be provided case management services using HSI funds. Patients will be enrolled in the HSI in itiative during pregnancy , during the post -partum period , or by referral . Once enrolled, HSI services will continue, as appropriate, for one- year post - delivery with the exceptions noted in the paragraph above. The HSI will be coordinated by the Alabama Department of Public Health and delivered through designated county health departments. Depending upon the needs of those participating in the initiative, services may be provided by public health nurses, public health social workers, community health wor kers, etc. The proposed counties for initial implementation of the HSI include Montgomery, Macon and Russell counties. Services supported through this HSI will not supplant other federal, state or local funds allocated for similar services. Outreach a ctivities for the RIM HSI include providing education and information to pertinent providers, hospitals and programs serving the target population residing in the counties in which the expansion is implemented. In monitoring/evaluating the progress and success of this program, the total number of women and children served will be captured and reported to ALL Kids on an agreed upon schedule but no less than a quarterly basis. Tracking and reporting of visits and birth outcomes (birth weight, mortality wi thin the first year of life and maternal health indices) will also be included in reports to ALL Kids. The cost of the HSI is budgeted to be $753,625 for FY 2019 (July -Sept). Case Management Costs: Initially, within the proposed three county area, approximately 500 women/families could be served in FY 2019. The number of case management hours per person/family is estimated to be 10 hours/quarter at an average cost of $135/hour. This hourly rate would account for salary pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy from any cause related to or aggravate d by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes). Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 20 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 cost of those providing/coordin ating services. Additionally, it is estimated that staff will travel 25 miles per home visit and there will be two home visits/patient/quarter at the state mileage reimbursement rate of $0.545/mile. Annual 1st Quarter Case Management: Enrollees X case management hours $2,700,000 $675,000 X $135.00/hour Travel: # enrollees X miles/round trip X 2 trips/quarter X mileage $ 54,500 $ 13,625 reimbursement rate Start Up/Outreach Costs: As the HSI is being developed, costs are being allocated for personnel support to include up to two FTEs (one full -time project manager and other ancillary support staff as needed). Additionally, costs are included for the development of materials to promote and educate health care providers and community organizat ions throughout the implementation counties about the initiative and to garner support and participation of agencies/providers. Education and awareness materials to outreach to women will also be prepared. Expenses to conduct (as well as attend) meetings , conferences and/or trainings to share information about the program and generate participation are also included as part of the startup and implementation costs. Annual 1 st Quarter Personnel Costs (Salary, Fringe, Indirect costs) $200,000 $50,000 Educational/training materials $ 10,000 $10,000 (providers/organizations and participants) Costs for meetings (transportation/meeting fees) $ 5,000 $ 5,000 Grand Total: $2,969,500 $753,625 (Personnel, Materials, Meeting costs, Case Management) HSI II: ALL Babies Postpartum Initiative: As permitted under section 2105(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Social Security Act and federal regulations at 42 CFR 457.10, the State of Alabama is implementing a health services initiative (HSI) that will use CHIP funds, within the federal administrative expenditures cap allowed for states, to support the ALL Babies Postpartum Initiative. This HSI will assist in improving the health of children by ensuring their mothers have access to healthcare services during their postpa rtum period. The aim of this initiative is to provide full health insurance coverage during the postpartum period to enrollees who have been prenatally covered in the Reducing Infant Mortality Conception to Birth program known as ALL Babies. The length of the ALL Babies postpartum period is equivalent to Alabama Medicaid's current definition of the length of postpartum period \"From delivery through the end of the month in which the 60 th day postpartum falls, counting from the date the pregnancy ends eithe r as a full term or as a miscarriage.\" ALL Babies participants will be enrolled automatically in the postpartum HSI initiative. Metrics used to measure the impact of the state's HSI program on the health of low -income children and their mothers will be i ncluded in Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 21 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 the state's CHIP Annual Report. Cost: The cost of the HSI is budgeted to be $301,250 for FY 2021. This figure is based on anticipated enrollment (500 enrollees), an average enrollment time period of 2.5 months, and a per member per month (PMPM ) cost equal to the projected ALL Kids pmpm for 2021 ($241.00). 28, 2009) Section 1902(a)(73) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires a State in which one or more Indian Health Programs or Urban Indian Organizations furnish health care services to establish a process for the State Medicaid agency to seek advice on a regular, ongoing basis from designees of Indian health programs, whether operated by the Indian Health Service (IHS), Tribes or Tribal organizations under the Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act ( ISDEAA), or Urban Indian Organizations under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) . Section 2107(e)( 1)(C) of the Act was also amended to apply these requirements to the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) . Consultation is required concerning Medicaid and CHIP matters having a direct impact on Indian health programs and Urban Indian organizations . Describe the process the State uses to seek advice on a regular, ongoing basis from federally -recognized tribes, Indian Health Programs and Urban Indian Organizations on matters related to Medicaid and CHIP programs and for consultation on State Plan Amendm ents, waiver proposals, waiver extensions, waiver amendments, waiver renewals and proposals for demonstration projects prior to submission to CMS . Include information about the frequency, inclusiveness and process for seeking such advice. ALL Kids provides a certified letter to the federally recognized tribe in the state when considering amendments to the State Plan or other program changes requiring CMS approval. The tribe is given 30 days to respond. In the event of an emergency, ALL Kids will submit a faxed letter to the tribe and give 10 days for response. Section 3 . Methods of Delivery and Utilization Controls Check here if the State elects to use funds provided under Title XXI only to provide expanded eligibility under the State's Medicaid plan, and continue on to Section 4. Guidance: In Section 3.1., discussion may include, but is not limited to: contracts with managed health care plans (including fully and partially capitated plans); contracts with indemnity health insurance plans; and other arrangements for health care delivery . The State should describe any variations based upon geography, as well as the State methods for establishing and defining the delivery systems. Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 22 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 Should the State choose to cover unborn children under the Title XXI State plan, the State must describe how services are paid . For example, some states make a global payment for all unborn children while other states pay for services on fee -for-services basis. The State's payment mechanism and delivery mechanism should be briefly described here. Section 2103(f)(3) of the Act, as amended by section 403 of CHIPRA, requires separate or combination CHIP programs that operate a managed care delivery system to apply several provisions of section 1932 of the Act in the same manner as these provisions apply under title XIX of the Act. Specific provisions include: section 1932(a)(4), Process for Enrollment and Termination and Change of Enrollment; section 1932(a)(5), Provision of Information; section 1932(b), section 1932(c), Quality Assurance Standards; section 1932(d), Protections Against Fraud and Abuse; and section 1932(e), Sanctions for Noncompliance . If the State CHIP program operates a managed care delivery system, provide an ass urance that the State CHIP managed care contract(s) complies with the relevant sections of section 1932 of the Act . States must submit the managed care contract(s) to the CMS Regional Office servicing them for review and approval. In addition, states may use up to 10 percent of actual or estimated Federal expenditures for targeted low -income children to fund other forms of child health assistance, including contracts with providers for a limited range of direct services; other health services initiatives to improve children's health; outreach expenditures; and administrative costs (See 2105( c)(2)(A)). Describe which, if any, of these methods will be used . Examples of the ab ove may include, but are not limited to: direct contracting with school -based heal th services; direct contracting to provide enabling services; contracts with health centers receiving funds under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act; contracts with hospitals such as those that receive disproportionate share payment adjustments u nder section 1886(d)(5)(F) or 1923 of the Act; contracts with other hospitals; and contracts with public health clinics receiving Title V funding . If applicable, address how the new arrangements under Title XXI will work with existing service delivery methods, such as regional networks for chronic illness and disability; neonatal care units, or early -intervention programs for at -risk infants, in the delivery and utilization of services. (42CFR 457.490(a)) 3.1. Delivery Standards Describe the methods of delivery of the child health assistance using Title XXI funds to targeted low -income children . Include a description of the choice of financing and the methods for assuring delivery of the insurance products and delivery of health care serv ices covered by such products to the enrollees, including any variations . (Section 2102)(a)(4) (42CFR 457.490(a)) Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 23 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 Phase I - Medicaid Expansion From February 2, 1998 through September 30, 2002, Phase I of CHIP, a Medicaid expansion was in existence. On October 1, 2002, Phase I of Alabama's CHIP was subsumed by the Alabama SOBRA Medicaid Program. As of October 1, 2015, CHIP will again expand Medicaid by covering Medicaid enrollees ages 14 years to 19 years with incomes above 13% FPL through 141% FPL. ALL Kids : Program Operation -Administration From inception of the program in 1998 through May, 2001, ALL Kids contracted with the State Employee's Insurance Board (SEIB) to serve as its enrollment and premium billing/receiving office. As enrollment grew, A LL Kids staff increased, and the need for data management grew, the ADPH CHIP unit and SEIB jointly decided to move the enrollment and premium billing/receiving functions to the CHIP unit. The Alabama Department of Public Health (Department) now manages all enrollment aspects of the ALL Kids program and utilizes other contractors to administer certain aspects of the ALL Kids program including, but not limited to, the following: 1. Providing all eligible persons involved in ALL Kids an individual policy or certificate that states the insurance protection provided, the method and place of filing claims, and to whom benefits are payable. The policy or certificate indicates that coverage was obtained through CHIP; 2. Maintenance of a claims database for the purp ose of program management. 3. Management of evaluation surveillance procedures. 4. Consultation for actuarial services 5. Consultation for development of data systems 6. Consultation for development of specialized outreach plans Program Operation -Benefits and Services The ALL Kids program is a self -funded, discounted fee -for-service*, PPO, delivery system. In order to assure delivery of the insurance product(s), the Department utilizes a private health care delivery organization(s) to provide benefits and services. Both indemnity plan(s) and or managed care plans(s) are acceptable and have been used. The selected vendor(s) is required to perform, including but not limited to, the following: 1. Furnishing coverage information and ID cards; 2. Member service responses to claims inquiries; 3. Claims certification, investigation, adjudication, and internal appeals process; 4. Processing and distribution of benefit payments to providers; 5. Appropriate and accurate fee administration; 6. Strict financial accounting and reconciliation; 7. Effective management of networks (if applicable); Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 24 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 8. Demonstrated capability to serve Alabama membership; 9. Effective medical, pharmacy and dental management including medical review of claims decisions; 10. Production of claims, contract, and other legal forms as required; 11. Establishment and maintenance of appropriate banking arrangements; 12. Continuous and accurate electronic transmission of all data; 13. Production of reports that capture claim and utilization ex perience and trends; 14. Other special services as may be requested from time to time 15. Have a network of physicians, dentists, pharmacies, and other providers capable of meeting the demands of the ALL Kids Program. 16. Facilitation of a medical home for each enrollee. *The exception to the fee -for-service payment system is the method of reimbursement to federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and rural health clinics (RHCs) based on a prospective payment system (PPS). This is in compliance with section 503 of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA). In accordance with this provision of CHIPRA, ALL Kids has elected to adopt the Medicaid PPS Rates effective October 1, 2009. This method of payment will be impleme nted August 25, 2010 for all qualifying services rendered on or after October 1, 2009. In the past, ALL Kids has used three (3) insurance venders, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama (statewide), Prime Health (in 10 southwestern counties from 10/98- 9/00) a nd United Healthcare (14 counties from 10/01- 7/02) for the above services. However, due to low enrollment in Prime Health and United Healthcare (which was due to patient choice), each of those programs elected, with the mutual consent of the ALL Kids program, to discontinue serving as an ALL Kids vendor. Currently, the only ALL Kids vendor for the above services is Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama. This vendor provides services statewide. CHIP makes health care coverage available to all individuals eli gible for ALL Kids on a \"guaranteed issue\" basis with no exclusions of coverage for pre -existing conditions, and on a \"guaranteed renewable\" basis for those eligible. ALL Kids PLUS Program Operation -Administration For this addition to the program, the A labama Department of Public Health has partnered (and seeks to partner) with other governmental agencies (which serve special needs children) to provide the state match, provide or provide for covered ALL Kids PLUS services, to authorize case by case reimb ursement for ALL Kids PLUS services, to notify ALL Kids PLUS families of their approval for services, and select one case manager per child so as to minimize duplication and gaps in services. PLUS services became available through CRS as of October 1, 2000. An ALL Kids PLUS contract was signed with the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation effective October 1, 2002. Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 25 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 Several state agencies, other provider entities, and advocates within the state have met to develop the concept and plan of operation for ALL Kids PLUS. At the present time, the list of ALL Kids PLUS authorizing agencies is restricted to those governmental agencies supplying the state match money. If other state or appropriated matching funds become available, this restriction may be modified or eliminated. A child must be enrolled in ALL Kids to qualify for PLUS services. When a child is identified with a special condition or need that a participating agency serves, he/she is referred to that agency based on that special condition/need. This agency will, based on the availability of funds, assign a case manager to the child, authorize needed services within the agency, and make referrals to other authorizing agencies for additional services if needed. All agencie s authorizing PLUS services for a child notify the child's case manager and referral site (if different) for approval of services. Each child will only have one ALL Kids PLUS case manager. The decision as to which agency will provide the case management will be determined by the agencies involved in the child's care and will be based on what makes the best practice sense and is in the best interest of the child. Authorizing agencies bill the insurance vendor(s) for any authorized PLUS services that the a gencies have provided directly or indirectly. The Alabama Department of Public Health reimburses the insurance vendor(s) in the same manner that reimbursement for the basic ALL Kids program is handled. At this time, the participating PLUS agencies do not utilize a central integrated data system. However, their day -to-day practice involves coordination through the case manager with other agencies to avoid duplication. Each agency submits all claims/data to the insurance vendor (BCBS) for adjudication and reimbursement. While a child may have claims submitted by more than one agency, only one agency may be reimbursed for case management services. Check here if the State child health program delivers services using a managed care delivery model . The State provides an assurance that its managed care contract(s) complies with the relevant provisions of section 1932 of the Act, including section 1932(a)(4), Process for Enrollment and Termination and Change of Enrollment; section 1932(a)(5), Provision of Information; section 1932(b), Beneficiary Protections; section 1932(c), Quality Assurance Standards; section 1932(d), Protections Against Fraud and Abuse; and section 1932(e), Sanctions for Noncompliance . The State also assures that it will su bmit the contract(s) to the CMS Regional Office for review and approval. (S ection 2103(f)(3)) Guidance: In Section 3.2., note that utilization control systems are those administrative mechanisms that are designed to ensure that enrollees receiving health care services under the State plan receive only appropriate and medic ally necessary health care consistent with the benefit package. Examples of utilization control systems include, but are not limited to: requirements for referrals to specialty care; requirements that clinicians use clinical practice guidelines; or deman d management systems (e.g., use of an 800 number for after - Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 26 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 hours and urgent care) . In addition, the State should describe its plans for review, coordination, and implementation of utilization controls, addressing both procedures and State developed standar ds for review, in order to assure that necessary care is delivered in a cost -effective and efficient manner . (42CFR 457.490(b)) 3.2. Describe the utilization controls under the child health assistance provided under the plan for targeted low -income children . Describe the systems designed to ensure that enrollees receiving health care services under the State plan receive only appropriate and medically necessary health care consistent with the benefit package described in the approved State plan . (Section 2102)(a)(4) (42CFR 457.490(b)) Utilization control mechanisms are in place for the ALL Kids program to ensure that children use only health care that is appropriate, medically necessary, and/or approved by the State or the participating health plan . In addition, policies are in place to assure that necessary care is delivered in a cost -effective and efficient manner according to the vendors' medical necessity definition. The current Blue Cross Blue Shield policies are available upon request. Befo re being approved for participation in the ALL Kids program, health plan vendors must develop and have in place utilization review policies and procedures, demand management, and disease state management mechanisms. Provider networks approved for the ALL Kids program are accepted based on evidence of the vendors' provider credentialing policies, provider accessibility, cost - effectiveness, and efficiency. Each ALL Kids PLUS authorizing state agency has a utilization review mechanism particular to that agen cy. Services approved for ALL Kids PLUS are those which are developmentally necessary and/or physically necessary. Reviewing the appropriate use of services is part of the case manager's duties. The Alabama Medicaid Agency applies the same utilization controls to the CHIP Medicaid expansion enrollees as it does to the entire Medicaid child book of business. Section 4 . Eligibility Standards and Methodology Guidance: States electing to use funds provided under Title XXI only to provide expanded eligibility under the State's Medicaid plan or combination plan should check the appropriate box and provide the ages and income level for each eligibility group. If the State is electing to take up the option to expand Medicaid eligibility as allowed under section 214 of CHIPRA regarding lawfully residing , complete section 4.1- LR as well as updat e the budget to reflect the additional costs if the state will claim title XXI match for these children until and if the time comes that the children are eligible for Medicaid .

ALL Kids PLUS is available to children with special conditions/needs who are enrolled in ALL Kids. ALL Kids PLUS enrollment is restricted to services authorized and financed by PLUS participating agencies. However, if access to additiona l matching funds becomes available and/or the health needs of CSHCC/N change, authorized services will be revised to reflect these changes. 4.1.7 Access to or coverage under other health coverage: A child is not eligible for ALL Kids if s/he has any other health insur ance Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 28 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 coverage or is eligible for Medicaid. 4.1.8 Duration of eligibility, not to exceed 12 months: 4.1.9 Other Standards - Identify and describe other standards for or affecting eligibility, including those standards in 42 CFR 45 7.310 and 457.320 that are not addressed above . For instance: Comprehensive health coverage will be provided from conception to birth for those with family incomes up to and including 312% FPL, whose mothers do not have comprehensive coverage, and reside in select counties in Alabama (initially Montgomery, Macon and Russell). Comprehensive coverage will be provided to this population from the date of enrollment and will continue until the last day of the month in which the 60 day postpartum period has elapsed after the end of a pregnancy. The date of enrollment may be as early as the first day of maternity- related service provision even if the application is completed a few days after the service is received. In other cases coverage will begin on the date the application is received by the CHIP office. Prenatal care , labor and delivery and limited postpartum care are paid using a bundled payment. In addition to the bundled payment, the state will provide comprehensive coverage during the postpartum period through ALL Babies HSI Initiative. For example, if a woman gi ves birth on June 26, benefits covered in the bundled package or postpartum HSI would end on August 31. Obstetric coverage for current ALL Kids members includes all prenatal care through 90 days postpartum and is billed as a bundled payment. Social Secur ity numbers for the babies will not be required unless and until the child is born and applies for renewal. Guidance: States may only require the SSN of the child who is applying for coverage. If SSNs are required and the State covers unborn children, indicate that the unborn children are exempt from providing a SSN. Other standards include, but are not limited to presumptive eligibility and deemed newborns. 4.1.9.1 States should specify whether Social Security Nu mbers (SSN) are required . Guidance: States should describe their continuous eligibility process and populations that can be continuously eligible. 4.1.9.2 Continuous e ligibility 4.1-PW Pregnant Women Option (section 2112) - The State includes eligibility for one or more populations of targeted low -income pregnant women under the plan. D escribe the population of pregnant women that the State proposes to cover in this section. Include all eligibility criteria, such as those described in the above categories (for Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 29 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 instance, income and resources) that will be applied to this population. Use t he same reference number system for those criteria (for example, 4.1.1- P for a geographic restriction). Please remember to update section s 8.1.1- PW, 8.1.2- PW, and 9.10 when electing this option. Guidance: States have the option to cover groups of \"lawfully residing\" children and/or pregnant women . States may elect to cover (1) \"lawfully residing\" children described at section 2107(e)(1)(J ) of the Act; (2) \"lawfully residing\" pregnant women described at section 2107(e)( 1)(J) of the Act; or (3) both. A state electing to cover children and/or pregnant women who are considered lawfully residing in the U.S. must offer coverage to all such individuals who meet the definition of lawfully residing, and may not cover a subgroup or only certain groups . In addition, states may not cover these new groups only in CHIP , but must als o extend the coverage option to Medicaid. States will need to update their budget to reflect the additional costs for coverage of these children. If a State has been covering these children with State only funds, it is helpful to indicate that so CMS under stands the basis for the enrollment estimates and the projected cost of providing coverage. Please remember to update section 9.10 when electing this option. 4.1- LR Lawfully Residing Option (Sections 2107(e)(1)( J) and 1903(v)(4)(A); (CHIPRA # 17, SHO # 10- 006 issued July 1, 2010) Check if the State is electing the option under section 214 of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) regarding lawfully residing to provide coverage to the following otherwise eligible pregnant women and children as specified below who are lawfully residing in the United States including the following: A child or pregnant woman shall be considered lawfully present if he or she is: (1) A qualified alien as defined in section 431 of PRWORA (8 U.S.C. \u00a71641); (2) An alien in nonimmigrant status who has not violated the terms of the status under which he or she was admitted or to which he or she has changed after admission; (3) An alien who has been paroled into the United States pursuant to section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. \u00a71182(d)(5)) for less than 1 year, except for an alien paroled for prosecution, for deferred inspection or pending rem oval proceedings; (4) An alien who belongs to one of the following classes: (i) Aliens currently in temporary resident status pursuant to section 210 or 245A of the INA (8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71160 or 1255a, respectively); (ii) Aliens currently under Temporary Prot ected Status (TPS) pursuant to section 244 of the INA (8 U.S.C. \u00a71254a), and pending applicants for TPS who have been granted employment authorization; Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 30 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 (iii) Aliens who have been granted employment authorization under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(9), (10), (16), (18) , (20), (22), or (24); (iv) Family Unity beneficiaries pursuant to section 301 of Pub.

Elected for pregnant women. Elected for children under age 4.1.1- LR The State provides assurance that for an individual whom it enrolls in Medicaid under the CHIPRA Lawfully Residing option, it has verified, at the time of the individual's initial eligibility determination and at the time of the eligibility redetermination , that the individual continues to be lawfully residing in the United States. The State must first attempt to verify this status using information provided at the time of initial application. If the State cannot do so from the information readily available, it must require the individual to provide documentation or further evidence to verify satisfactory immigration s tatus in the same manner as it would for anyone else claiming satisfactory immigration status under section 1137(d) of the Act. 4.1-DS Supplemental Dental (Section 2103( c)(5)-A child who is eligible to enroll in dental - only supplemental coverage, effective January 1, 2009. Eligibility is limited to only targeted low -income children who are otherwise eligible for CHIP but for the fact that Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 31 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 they are enrolled in a group health plan or health insurance offered through an employer. The State's CHIP plan income eligibility level is at least the highest income eligibility standard under its approved State child health plan (or under a waiver) as of January 1, 2009. All who meet the eligibility standards and apply for dental -only supplemental coverage shall be provided benefits. States choosing thi s option must report these children separately in SEDS. Please update section s 1.1- DS, 4.2- DS, and 9.10 when electing this option. 4.2. Assurances - The State assures by checking the box below that it has made the following findings with respect to the eligibility standards in its plan:(Section 2102(b)(1)(B) and 42 CFR 457.320(b)) 4.2.1. These standards do not discriminate on the basis of diagnosis. 4.2.2.

T his applies to pregnant women as well as targeted low - income children. 4.2-DS Supplemental Dental -Please update sections 1.1- DS, 4.1- DS, and 9.10 when electing this option. For dental -only supplemental coverage, the State assures that it has made the following findings with standards in its plan: (Section 2102(b)(1)(B) and 42 CFR 457.320(b)) 4.2.1- DS These standards do not discriminate on the basis of diagnosis. 4.2.2- DS Within a defined group of covered targeted low -income children, these standards do not cover children of higher income families without covering children with a lower family income. 4.2.3- DS These standards do not deny eligibility based on a child havi ng a pre - existing medical condition. 4.3. Methodology. Describe the methods of establishing and continuing eligibility and enrollment . The description should address the procedures for applying the eligibility standards, the organization and infrastru cture responsible for making and reviewing eligibility determinations, and the process for enrollment of individuals receiving covered services, and whether the State uses the same application form f or Medicaid and/or other public benefit programs. (Section 2102)(b)(2)) (42CFR 457.350) Superseded by ACA SPA Guidance: The box below should be checked as related to children and pregnant women. Please note: A State providing dental -only supplemental coverage may not have a waiting list or limit eligibility in any way. 4.3.1. Limitation on Enrollment Describe the processes, if any, that a State will use for Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 32 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 instituting enrollment caps, establishing waiting lists, and deciding which children will be given priority for enrollment. If this section does not apply to your state, check the box below . (Section 2102(b)(2)) (42CFR 457.305(b)) There are no public notice state laws regarding enrollment caps and waiting lists in CHIP. Due to insufficient state funds, ALL Kids initiated a waiting list beginning with all new enrollees who would have had an effective date October 1, 2003. Public and enrollee notices about the waiting list were issued during the month of September 2003 prior to the impact of the waiting list. On August 23, 2004, ALL Kids reopened enrollment and discontinued use of the waiting list. If during the year funds are not available at sufficient levels for coverage of children and funding is projected to be depleted before the end of the fiscal year, it is the State's intent to place eli gible children on a waiting list until adequate funding becomes available to resume enrollment. Alabama will provide public notice through press releases, written communication with stakeholders and stakeholder groups, presentations, and written communica tion from the program to all applicant families whose child(ren) is/are placed on the waiting list. When a waiting list is implemented, the program has and will continue to receive new applications. These applications will be screened for Medicaid eligi bility and then reviewed for ALL Kids eligibility. If a child is eligible for Medicaid, the child will be enrolled in Medicaid. Each family whose child is placed on the ALL Kids waiting list will be notified, by letter, of this placement. The notificati on letter will also contain information stating that the parent may wish to contact Medicaid if his situation changes and he believes that his child may be eligible for Medicaid. If the child remains on the waiting list for longer than three (3) months, t he family will be periodically notified via letter that the child's name is still on the waiting list. If the State is using a waiting list, children will be enrolled on ALL Kids from the waiting list on a first on -first off basis as funding permits. Wh en attrition has lowered program enrollment to a level at which there are sufficient state funds to re- open enrollment, children will be removed from the waiting list ( on a first on first off basis) and enrolled in ALL Kids. Children who are removed fro m the waiting list whose application information is greater than 90 days old will be asked to complete a form updating changes in information on their family size, income, and other points of eligibility. Upon receipt of the form, ALL Kids enrollment staf f will evaluate the child's eligibility for ALL Kids. Then , if eligible, either the child will be enrolled in ALL Kids or Medicaid and the family will be notified. Children who have current enrollment in ALL Kids will be allowed to continue to renew their enrollment as long as they continue to meet all points of eligibility and have their renewal forms submitted and premium balances paid in full within 90 days after the date Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 33 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 of termination . Check here if this section does not apply to your State. Guidance: Note that for purposes of presumptive eligibility, States do not need to verify the citizenship status of the child . States electing this option should indicate so in the State plan.(42 CFR 457.355) 4.3.2. Check if the State elects to provide presumptive eligibility for children that meets the requirements of section 1920A of the Act. (Section 2107(e)(1)( L)); (42 CFR 457.355) Guidance: Describe how the State intends to implement the Express Lane option. Include information on the identified Express Lane agency or agencies, and whether the Sta te will be using the Express Lane eligibility option for the initial eligibility determinations, redeterminations, or both. 4.3.3- EL Express Lane Eligibility Check here if the state elects the option to rely on a finding from an Express Lane agency when determining whether a child satisfies one or more components of CHIP eligibility. The state agrees to comply with the requirements of section s 2107(e)(1)(E ) and 1902(e)(13) of the Act for this option. Please update section s 4.4- EL, 5.2-EL, 9.10, and 12.1 when electing this option. This authority may not apply to eligibility determinations made before February 4, 2009, or after September 30, 2013 . (Section 2107(e)(1)( E)) 4.3.3.1- ELA lso in dicate whether the Express Lane option is applied to (1) initial eligibility determination, (2) redetermination, or (3) both . 4.3.3.2- ELList the public agencies approved by the State as Express Lane agencies. 4.3.3.3- ELList the components/components of CHIP eligibility that are determined under the Express Lane . In this section, specify any differences in budget unit, deeming, income exclusions, income disregards, or other methodology between CHIP eligibility determinations for such children and the determination under the Ex press Lane option. 4.3.3.3- ELList the component/components of CHIP eligibility that are determined under the Express Lane. 4.3.3.4- ELD escribe the option used to satisfy the screen and enrollment requirements before a child may be enrolled under title XXI . Guidance: States should describe the process they use to screen and enroll children required Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 34 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 under section 2102(b)(3)(A) and (B) of the Social Security Act and 42 CFR 457.350(a) and 457.80(c). D escribe the screening threshold set as a percentage of the Federal poverty level (FPL) that exceeds the highest Medicaid income threshold applicable to a child by a minimum of 30 percentage points. (NOTE: The State may set this threshold higher than 30 perce ntage points to account for any differences between the income calculation methodologies used by an Express Lane agency and those used by the State for its Medicaid program. The State may set one screening threshold for all children, based on the highest M edicaid income threshold, or it may set more than one screening threshold, based on its existing, age -related Medicaid eligibility thresholds.) Include the screening threshold(s) expressed as a percentage of the FPL, and provide an explanation of how this was calculated. Describe whether the State is temporarily enrolling children in CHIP, based on the income finding from an Express Lane agency, pending the completion of the screen and enroll process. In this section, states should describe their eligibility screening process in a way that addresses the five assurances specified below . The State should consider including important definitions, the relationship with affected Federal, State and local agencies, and other applicable criteria that will describe the State's ability to make assurances. (Sections 2102(b)(3)(A) and 2110(b)(2)(B)), (42 CFR 457.310(b)(2), 42CFR 457.350(a)(1) and 457.80(c)(3)) 4.4. Eligibility screening and coordination with other health coverage programs States must descri be how they will assure that: 4.4.1. only targete d low -income children who are ineligible for Medicaid or not covered under a group health plan or health i nsurance (including access to a State health benefits plan) are furnished child health assistance under the plan.(Sections 2102(b C onfir m that the State does not apply a waiting period for pregnant women. The State of Alabama assures that through enrollment screening processes, children whose applicatio ns are considered to be eligible for medical assistance under the State Medicaid plan will be referred for assistance under the appropriate plan. Additionally, ALL Kids eligibility staff query the Medicaid eligibility system to ensure applicants are not currently on any Medicaid program. All applications request the parent/guardian to provide the names and addresses of their employers. Eligibility staff screen all applications to ensure applicant children are not currently covered under group health insurance and have not voluntarily terminated group coverage within the last three months. In an effort to further minimize crowd -out, ALL Kids receives a daily \"error report\" which indicates children who have current BCBS health insurance or have terminated a BCBS policy within the last three months. In addition, quality assurance reviews are conducted on a sample of ALL Kids enrollees. Redetermination is completed every 12 months. Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 35 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 4.4.2. children found through the screening process to be potentially eligible for medi cal assistance under the State Medicaid p lan are enrolled for assistance under such plan; (Section 2102(b)(3)(B )) (42CFR 457.350(a)(2)) .

Because a joint application is used, no additional form is required to be completed . Parents are notified by ALL regarding this determination 4.4.3. children found through the screening process to b e ineligible for Medicaid are enrolled in CHIP .(Sections 2102(a)(1) a nd (2) and 2102(c)(2)) (42CFR 431.636(b)(4)) ALL Kids and Medicaid have a joint eligibility and enrollment system. When a Medicaid enrollment worker determines that a child is ineligible for Medicaid and eligible f or ALL Kids, the worker enrolls the child in ALL Kids. Coverage is based on the application receipt date at the Medicaid office or the child's last date of Medicaid or ALL Kids coverage. ALL Kids staff work very closely with the Medicaid central office a nd Medicaid enrollment workers to ensure that the policies and procedures of both agencies reflect the agencies' desires for seamless transitions between the two agencies. 4.4.4. the insurance provided under the State child health plan does not substitute for coverage under group health plans . (Section 2102(b)(3)(C)) (42CFR, 457.805) This section is superseded by ACA SPA 4.4.4.1. (formerly 4.4.4.4) If the State provides coverage under a premium assistance program, describe: 1) the minimum period without coverage under a group health plan . This should i nclude any allowable exceptions to the waiting period; 2) the expecte d minimum level of contribution employers will make; and 3) how cost -effectiveness is determined . (42CFR 457.810(a) -(c)) 4.4.5. Child health assistance is provided to targeted low -income children i n the State who are American Indian and Alaska Native. (Section 2102(b)(3)(D)) (42CFR 457.125(a)) The State of Alabama assures the provision of child health assistance to targeted low -income children in the State who are American Indians (as defined in section 4(c) of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, 25 U.S.C. 1603(c)). As Stated in section 4.1, the ALL Kids program will provide Statewide coverage. No ALL Kids enrollee identified as being an American Indian will be charged a premium or co -pay. This policy extends to all children who identify themselves as an American Indian children whether th ey are a member of a federally recognized tribe or one of the eight state- only recognized tribes. Representatives from the Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 36 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 Poarch Band of Creek Indians (the only federally recognized Tribe in Alabama) have assisted in the development of ALL Kids PLUS. Tr ibal children will have access to PLUS services. CHIP staff meet and coordinate regularly with the Alabama Commission on Indian Affairs to ensure that Native American Children are identified and enrolled in ALL Kids. Additionally, a Native American was hired under a one -year contract to consult with ALL Kids staff and develop a comprehensive strategy to outreach to Native American children. Guidance: When the State is using an income finding from an Express Lane agency, the State must still comply with screen and enroll requirements before enrolling children in CHIP. The State may either continue its current screen and enroll process, or elect one of two new options to fulfill these requirements. 4.4-EL The State should designate the option it will be using to carry out screen and enroll requirements: The State will continue to use the screen and enroll procedures r equired under section 2102(b)(3)(A) and (B) of the Social Sec urity Act and 42 CFR 457.350(a) and 42 CFR 457.80(c). Describe this process. The State is establishing a screening threshold set as a percentage of the Federal poverty level (FPL) that exceeds the highest Medicaid income threshold applicable to a child by a minimum of 30 percentage points. (NOTE: The State may set this threshold higher than 30 percentage points to account for any differences between the income calculation methodologies used by the Express Lane agency and those used by the State for its Medicaid program. The State may set one screening threshold for all children, based on the highest Medicaid income threshold, or it may set more than one screening threshold, based on its existing, age -related Medicaid eligibility thresholds.) Include the screening threshold(s) expressed as a percentage of the FPL, and provide an explanation of how this was calculated. The State is temporarily enrolling children in CHIP, based on the income finding from the Express Lane agency, pending the completion of the screen and enroll process. Section 5 . Outreach and Coordination 5.1. (formerly 2.2) Describe the current State efforts to provide or obtain creditable health coverage for uninsured children by addres sing sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2.(Section 2102)(a)(2) (42CFR 457.80(b)) Guidance: The information below may include whether the state elects express lane eligibility a description of the State's outreach efforts through Medicaid and state-only programs. Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 37 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 5.1.1. (formerly 2. 2.1.) The steps the State is currently taking to identify and e nroll all uninsured children who are eligible to participate in public health insurance programs (i.e., Medicaid and state -only child health insurance): In Alabama, thanks to outreach efforts of a variety of public and private agencies and organizations, there is a high awareness level of children's health insurance programs and their eligibility requirements. Over one- fourth of children under the age of 19 in Alabama are covered by Medicaid or ALL Kids. The programs are reaching children who might not otherwise have access to the health care they need. Prior to CHIP, the Medicaid Program was the only public health insurance program for children in Alabama. Health services are provided in Alabama to uninsured and Medicaid enrolled children by private physicians, the 67 Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) county health departments, 16 primary care centers (including Federally Qualified Health Centers), two children's hospitals (The Children's Hospital of Alabama and Women's and Child ren's Hospital at the University of South Alabama) school health nurses, and one Indian Health Service Clinic. In addition to the two children's hospitals, Alabama Department of Rehabilitation Services, Children's Rehabilitation Services (CRS) provides specialty care to uninsured and Medicaid enrolled children with special health care needs. As lead agency for Alabama's Early Intervention System, this agency coordinates services for infants and toddlers eligible for IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Edu cation Act), part C. This section describes the current efforts made by the ADPH to provide health care services, and to identify and enroll uncovered children in the Medicaid and ALL Kids programs. This section also describes the efforts made by CRS, th e Alabama Medicaid Agency, the Alabama Department of Human Resources, and the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation to identify and enroll all uncovered children who are eligible to participate in the Medicaid and ALL Kids programs. Alabama Department of Public Health As the CHIP lead agency, the ADPH is actively involved in all aspects of identification and enrollment of children who are eligible to participate in public health insurance programs and health insurance programs that involve public -private partnerships. Activities include the creation, publication, and distribution of marketing materials, management of the ALL Kids enrollment process, and targeted outreach activities for specific populations such as faith -based organizations, etc. The Alabama Department of Public Health provides some direct as well as support patient care for uninsured and Medicaid enrolled children and adolescents. Direct services for this population include: preventive child health services (well -child check -ups), prenatal services, Women Infants and Children Supplemental Nutrition [WIC] program services, preventive health education, immunizations, and Family Planning program services. Support services include case management services, the provision of information and referral via toll -free telephone lines, and laboratory services. These services are funded through federal Title V Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 38 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 Maternal and Child Health Block Grant funds, federal Title X Family Planning program funds, federal WIC Program funds, M edicaid program reimbursements, federal immunization funds, state legislative appropriations, some local government appropriations, and a small amount of patient fee revenue. A variety of the above direct and support services are provided within ADPH county health departments. In fiscal year 2001, 34,664 children (birth through age 18 years) received health services in local county health departments. (This number excludes single service patients [STD -only, Immunization -only, WIC -only].) The Alabama Department of Public Health is the state's Title V agency. Additionally, there are approximately 512 school health nurses, R.N.s and L.P.N.s, (working under the auspices of the ADPH, private hospitals, the Alabama State Department of Education, and/or local education agencies) in the state who provide a variety of health screening services, primary care and emergency services, Medicaid/ALL Kids enrollment facilitation, etc. Income assessments are performed on all patients enrolled in ADPH clinics. The in come assessments are reviewed for possible Medicaid eligibility. Beginning in FY 1991, Medicaid eligibility workers were out -stationed in health departments and other health care facilities to accept applications and complete Medicaid eligibility determin ations at the time of health visits. A streamlined, four- page expanded Medicaid eligibility form, which was implemented in FY 1991, has been revised into a joint application with CHIP and the Alabama Child Caring Foundation (ACCF) and is available at coun ty health departments. Out -stationed Medicaid eligibility personnel currently assist patients in completing the forms and data is put into an automated Medicaid system on -site. Final determination for Medicaid can then be made immediately. If the children appear to be ALL Kids or ACCF eligible the application is forwarded to the appropriate program. New applications, as well as annual reviews of established patients, are assessed by ADPH intake staff and/or care coordinators for possible referral for med ical assistance through Medicaid, ACCF, or SSI. When appropriate, staff assist families in completing the application forms, making appointments, and gathering medical information. Out -stationed Medicaid eligibility workers are based in many ADPH clinics , hospitals, and primary care centers across the state. Additionally, two Medicaid out stationed workers and a clerk are now located in the CHIP office who process many ALL Kids referrals. A third worker will be added in FY 2003. Cross training session s with staff at many levels has improved interagency communication at the community level. In order to provide additional outreach, the ADPH operates two toll -free telephone lines for use by the general public. The toll -free telephone lines (established prior to the implementation of CHIP and continued to the present) are known as Healthy Beginnings and Info Connection. Two integral parts of the information provided to callers, via these telephone lines, are information on Medicaid, ALL Kids, and ACCF el igibility and referrals to health providers who accept Medicaid -eligible children and Medicaid -eligible pregnant women. Referral services provided by the Healthy Beginnings and Info Connection staff members are expanded Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 39 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 through consultation supplied by a host of additional professionals located within the ADPH. The toll -free number for Healthy Beginnings is 1 -800-654-1385. The Info Connection number is 1-800-545-1098. Both lines are operational 24 hours a day, seven (7) days a week; office hours are fro m 8:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. each week day. The Healthy Beginnings and Info Connection lines are publicized statewide through newspapers, television, posters, and pamphlets. Presentations regarding the lines are conducted statewide to various organizations and agencies. The numbers are also published in Alabama South Central Bell telephone books. Additionally, with the implementation of CHIP, the CHIP unit maintains two toll- free telephone lines (888 -373-5437 for enrollment and eligibility issues and 877- 774-9521 for administrative issues). Finally, in addition to the above efforts, ALL Kids, Medicaid, and the Alabama Child Caring Foundation have developed a joint application and renewal form for use by all three programs. This enables families to be screened for eligibility for all three programs and facilitates referrals and timely enrollment in the appropriate program. Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA) ADECA notifies the ALL Kids regional staff when a plant or large business plans to close in the near future. ALL Kids regional staff present ALL Kids information and materials at employee meetings prior to the plant/business closing. In order to prevent gaps in health insurance coverage for the children of the employees of th e plant/business, an ALL Kids policy was developed which provides for beginning ALL Kids coverage (for eligible children) the day after employer sponsored coverage ends if an application is received by the ALL Kids enrollment unit within 30 days after the plant/business closing. Alabama Department of Rehabilitation Services Children's Rehabilitation Service Children's Rehabilitation Service (CRS) also has coordination agreements with the Alabama Medicaid Agency. (These contracts existed prior to CHIP and have continued to be in effect.) The Alabama Medicaid Agency contracted with CRS for the provision of sp ecialty medical services, specialized therapy (such as physical, occupational, speech, etc. ) services, and case management services to children with special health care needs. With the implementation of ALL Kids, CRS clinics were added as preferred provid ers under the ALL Kids basic benefits package and the ALL Kids PLUS package. New applications, as well as annual reviews of established patients, are assessed by CRS intake staff and/or care coordinators for possible referral for medical assistance throug h Medicaid, ALL Kids, ACCF, or SSI. When appropriate, staff assist families in completing the application forms, making appointments, and gathering medical information. Joint Medicaid/ALL Kids/ACCF eligibility forms are available in all CRS offices and c linics. As in the ADPH, cross training sessions with staff at many levels has improved interagency communication at the community level. Medicaid and ALL Kids information and outreach brochures and posters are available in every CRS office throughout the state. Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 40 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 Additionally, like the ADPH, CRS operates toll -free telephone lines for use by the general public. One line is operated at the state level in Montgomery and additional lines are located in each CRS district office. An integral part of the inform ation provided to callers, via these telephone lines, is Medicaid, ALL Kids, and ACCF eligibility and referral information. CRS and Early Intervention (EI) have both completed database matches with ALL Kids files to identify children known to both program s. CHIP staff have participated in many staff trainings throughout the state to assist CRS and EI staff in outreach for ALL Kids, Medicaid, and ACCF. Division of Early Intervention As the lead agency for Alabama's early intervention system for infants and toddlers with developmental disabilities and their families, this unit provides a toll free Child Find telephone number for use by the general public and primary referral sources. Additional efforts for coordination are described in the PLUS sections of this document. Medicaid Agency The Alabama Medicaid Agency has 135 eligibility workers in over 170 locations to enroll children eligible for SOBRA Medicaid whose the family's income is at or below 100 percent of FPL (for children born after September 3 0, 1983) or 133 percent of the FPL (for children through age five). With the implementation of CHIP, 23 workers were added throughout the state. In March, 2002, two eligibility workers and a clerk were housed in the ALL Kids central office to review ap plications referred from the ALL Kids eligibility workers. In addition to the CHIP office, these workers are located in places children are likely to go to receive health care - - county health departments, Federally Qualified Health Centers and hospitals. Because workers are in the community, they can and do establish working relationships with public and private providers, social service agencies and others. For example, supervisors provide in - service training and education on Medicaid, ALL Kids, and AC CF eligibility to physicians, Head Start workers, day care centers, Human Resources staff and others. The Alabama Medicaid Agency also has 10 district offices located throughout the state that process applications for the elderly and the disabled populat ion. The 80 eligibility workers and 20 supervisors advise applicants about other programs and refer the applicants to the proper office when they do not qualify for a disabled program. They also advise about programs for which other family members may be eligible. These district offices work closely with providers to keep them informed of all programs available through the Medicaid Agency. Applications for Medicaid, ALL Kids, and ACCF are easily available to anyone who needs one. Applications are avail able not only from Medicaid workers but also at physicians' offices, county offices of the Department of Human Resources and hospitals. All sources of the joint application (i.e., ADPH, CRS, etc.) allow a \"mail -in\" application process thereby allowing Med icaid to complete a phone interview instead of a face- to-face interview. Medicaid has a toll - free number for anyone to call to ask questions about Medicaid eligibility and find out where and how to apply. The number is 1 -800-362-1504. Medicaid's Web sit e contains information Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 41 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 on Medicaid eligibility and is used by advocates to assist people who want to apply for Medicaid. Through its Medical Care Advisory Committee and its Physicians Task Force, Medicaid receives guidance on ways to reach potential Medicaid eligible . Medicaid staff regularly brief these groups, who represent both providers and consumers, on all facets of the Medicaid program, including eligibility. Both groups are kept informed of upcoming changes in the Medicaid program and encouraged to provide comments and suggestions. With welfare reform and the separation of Medicaid eligibility from eligibility for public assistance, the Alabama Medicaid Agency and the Department of Human Resources have developed new cooperative arrangements to ass ure that children in the state's lowest income families have access to Medicaid. Applications may be completed through the mail with a telephone interview, thus eliminating the need for a face- to-face contact. Currently DHR workers assess their clients t o determine whether they might be eligible for any Medicaid, ALL Kids, or ACCF program. Workers help to complete forms, gather information and make appointments as necessary. However, the enrollment function for this Medicaid program will be transferred from DHR to the Medicaid Agency within the coming year. Outreach occurs after the birth of an infant to a Medicaid recipient. Following the birth of each newborn whose mother is a Medicaid recipient, the Alabama Medicaid Agency sends the infant's parent or guardian a pamphlet on the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) program as well as a pamphlet on immunizations. When children are enrolled in the SSI Program, they are automatically enrolled in the Medicaid Program. Additionally, a brochure is sent to parents/guardians of all new SSI eligible children encouraging them to participate in the EPSDT program. In addition to these efforts, social workers within the ADPH conduct patient recruitment as a part of their case management activities. These recruitment efforts are conducted through community presentations and professional relationships with other State and local agencies which serve mothers and children. The Alabama Department of Human Resources and the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation also provide case management services for Medicaid children known to their agencies, in order to facilitate their enrollment in health services particularly mental health services through the Rehabilitation Option. Through CHIP Phase I, the Alabama Medicaid Agency, working with the Alabama Department of Public Health, took several major steps to identify and enroll all uncovered children who were eligible to participate in this public health insurance program. New el igibility workers were hired and they, plus existing eligibility workers, were trained in CHIP eligibility criteria as well as other Medicaid eligibility criteria. These eligibility workers are out stationed in health departments, hospitals, community hea lth centers, CHIP office, etc. Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 42 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 In order to streamline the CHIP/Medicaid enrollment process, the Alabama Medicaid Agency initiated continuous eligibility for all Medicaid children under the age of 19 years, on April 1, 1998. Continuous eligibility means that Medicaid enrolled children maintain their Medicaid coverage continuously for one year from enrollment or re- determination. Additionally, numerous presentations, regarding CHIP, have been made by knowledgeable professionals who are members of the bro ad based CHIP Workgroup and CHIP staff. These presentations include addresses to education professionals, rural health groups, child care management agencies, parents of children with special health care needs, Indian Health Service staff, the general public, etc. Some specific activities include: Notice to all Medicaid providers News releases and camera -ready materials for newspapers Articles published in newsletters of health care provider associations -Medical Association of the State of Alabama, Al abama Hospital Association, Alabama Dental Association, and others Television commercials Radio spots Brochures have been distributed to date for out stationed Medicaid workers, public health workers, county human resources workers, Early Intervention Coo rdinating Councils , Mental Health Centers, family services centers, primary health care centers, hospitals, advocacy and professional organization, and in the school system, principles and guidance counselors . Brochures distributed at state meetings of Al abama Conference of Social Work, Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics -Alabama Chapter, Alabama Dental Association, Family Practice doctors, and others Satellite conferences to provide information about the basic ALL Kids Program and instruction in completing the application. Distribution of applications and brochures to all public school systems, local health departments, welfare offices, hospitals, community health centers, physician and dentist offices, pharmacies, WIC clinics, and fam ily law attorneys, etc. Public forums for parents and advocates of CSHCC/N (Children with Special Health Care Conditions/Needs) With specific regard to the Conception to Birth expansion and the RIM HSI, the ADPH will provide information to pertinent provi ders, hospitals and programs serving the target population residing in the counties in which the expansion is implemented. In addition to the above, the state has engaged in the following particular activities to promote ALL Kids PLUS. Originally, it was anticipated that ALL Kids PLUS would involve four state programs, Children's Rehabilitation Service, Early Intervention, Mental Health/Mental Retardation, and Civitan International Research Center Sparks Clinics. After conducting database matches, reviews of Pediatric Health History information, claims data, through Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 43 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 mutual agreement, Sparks determined that their services were being adequately reimbursed through the ALL Kids basic benefit package. Therefore, attention was focused on the remaining three agencies. Since that time, CHIP has entered into discussions with the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind with regard to becoming an ALL Kids PLUS provider. CRS has had an active contract for the provision of PLUS services since October, 2000 and h as served as a valuable partner in establishing protocols for the identification of ALL Kids enrollees in need of PLUS services and the identification of current clients in need of insurance coverage. Initially it was anticipated that children would be identified for the PLUS program through an in-depth analysis of the Pediatric Health History and chart reviews. Practical experience has shown that this was not the most productive method of identificati on. Database matches were necessary as a first action to even identify ALL Kids enrollees who were being served by CRS. After this baseline was established, claims reviews were shown to be a more valuable mechanism in identifying children eligible for PL US services than were chart reviews. This claims review revealed that a much smaller percentage of ALL Kids enrollees, than originally projected, were in need of services beyond those available in the basic benefits package. Program staff continually moni tor feedback from providers and families regarding the need for additional services. This type of feedback and analysis has influenced the approaches that have been used with the other potential ALL Kids PLUS agencies. Through the activities of the regio nal ALL Kids staff, central office social work consultant, and customer service staff, ALL Kids enrollees in need of these specialized services provided by ALL Kids PLUS agencies have been identified and referred as appropriate. In August of 1999, the ADPH broadcasted a nationwide satellite conference to educate the provider community and other concerned individuals regarding ALL Kids PLUS. In addition, CHIP staff provided training on the PLUS program to CRS staff at regional meetings. Alabama Departm ent of Human Resources (DHR) The DHR has continued to partner with the ADPH to communicate ALL Kids information to their county staffs. They have provided initial and continuing updates to county DHR staff as well as provided periodic shipments of applica tions, posters, etc. The DHR has also assisted with outreach efforts through its childcare management agencies and facilitated communication with licensed child day -care homes and centers. Guidance: The State may address the coordination between the publ ic-private outreach and the public health programs that is occurring statewide . This section will provide a historic record of the steps the State is taking to identify and enroll all uninsured children from the time the State's plan was initially approved . States do not have to rewrite his section but may instead update this section as Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 44 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 appropriate. 5.1.2. (formerly 2. 2.2.) The steps the State is currently taking to identify and enroll all uninsured children who are eligible to participate in health insura nce programs that involve a public -private partnership: There is only one health insurance program for children in Alabama that resembles a public - private partnership. This program is known as the Alabama Child Caring Foundation (ACCF) and is a part of Blue Cross Blue Shield. The Alabama Child Caring Foundation provides limited ambulatory health insurance to low income, non- Medicaid/non -ALL Kids, uninsured children under the age of 19 years who remain full -time students through grade 12. The program i s funded through private donations and matching funds from Blue Cross Blue Shield. Outreach for this program is conducted through articles in Blue Cross Blue Shield publications and public service announcements in local newspapers, via television, and radio stations. The University of Alabama and Auburn University coaches' television shows expressly advertise the Foundation. Case finding is conducted by school administrators, school nurses, day care operators, and others. Additionally referrals to the F oundation are received from the ALL Kids program, local offices of the ADPH, the Alabama Medicaid Agency, the Alabama Department of Human Resources, the Alabama Department of Industrial Relations Dislocated Workers program, individual health care providers , civic organizations, churches, Sunday School classes, other religious organizations, and from Foundation participants. Guidance: The State should describe below how it's Title XXI program will closely coordinate the enrollment with Medicaid because unde r Title XXI, children identified as Medicaid -eligible are required to be enrolled in Medicaid . Specific information related to Medicaid screen and enroll procedures is requested in Section 4.4. (42CFR 457.80(c)) 5.2. (formerly 2.3) Describe how CHIP coordinates with other public and private health insurance programs, other sources of health benefits coverage for children, other relevant child health programs, (such as title V), that provide health care services for low-income childr en to increase the number of children w ith creditable health coverage. (Section 2102(a)(3) ,2102(b)(3)(E) and 2102(c)(2)) (42CFR 457.80(c)).This item requires a brief overv iew of how Title XXI efforts - particular ly new enrollment outreach efforts - will be co ordinated with and improve upon existing State efforts . The State of Alabama assures coordination with other public and private programs providing creditable coverage for low -income children. The SOBRA Medicaid program, ALL Kids, and the Alabama Child Caring Foundation have developed and use joint application and renewal forms. Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 45 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 All applications received by the ALL Kids enrollment unit are screened for Medicaid eligibility. When a child is identified by an ALL Kids enrollment worker as potentially el igible for Medicaid, the family's application is sent to a Medicaid enrollment worker. Medicaid then processes it. As stated previously, two Medicaid enrollment workers and one clerical worker are physically located within the ALL Kids enrollment unit. This process also works in the reverse (applications are sent from Medicaid to ALL Kids ). When a child is identified by an ALL Kids enrollment worker as not potentially eligible for the Medicaid or ALL Kids but potentially eligible for the Alabama Child Caring Foundation (ACCF), the family's application is sent to ACCF which then processes it and the opposite is also true. Because it is recognized that the eligibility and enrollment systems of these three programs are not as seamless as needed, ALL Kids employs a full time MSW staff person. This staff person has responsibility to assist families in overcoming obstacles related to eligibility, enrollment, claims, and referral for specialty services as needed. Additional responsibilities include development and maintenance of the ALL Kids policy manual. In addition, the State coor dinates with the ALL Kids PLUS authorizing agencies. See the previous section for a broader description of the collaboration. 5.2-EL The State should include a description of its election of the Express Lane eligibility option to provide a simplified eli gibility determination process and expedited enrollment of eligible children into Medicaid or CHIP. Guidance: Outreach strategies may include, but are not limited to, community outreach workers, out stationed eligibility workers, translation and transportation services, assistance with enrollment forms, case management and other targeting activities to inform families of low -income children of the availability of the health insurance program under the plan or other private or public health coverage. The description should include infor mation on how the State will inform the target of the availability of the programs, including American Indians and Alaska Natives, and assist them in enrolling in the appropriate program. 5.3. Strategies Describe the procedures used by the State to accomp lish outreach to families of children likely to be eligible for child health assistance or other public or private health coverage to inform them of the availability of the programs, and to assist them in enrolling th eir children in such a program. ( Sectio n 2102(c)(1)) (42CFR 457.90) Effect ive 2021 46 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 Phase I - Medicaid Expansion This portion of the outreach section, as it pertains to Phase I of Alabama's Title XXI program, consists solely of efforts that were targeted toward Medicaid eligibles who were born after Septem ber 30, 1983 and who are under 19 years of age. There were four primary avenues through which outreach was conducted. These avenues were (1) the use of existing outreach approaches, (2) an initiative to improve communication with and services for the state's rapidly expanding Hispanic population, (3) an increase in the number of Medicaid eligibility workers, and (4) coordination with the State Medical Association and physicians to educate physicians and their potentially eligible patients. Detailed infor mation regarding these efforts is available from CHIP upon request. Phase II - ALL Kids Outreach for ALL Kids is conducted through coordinated Statewide and regional efforts and in each county through partnerships, contracts, and regional CHIP coordinators. These efforts consist of a three- pronged approach: (1) Statewide media campaigns and initiatives; (2) outreach conducted by multi -county regional workers and consultants; and, (3) outreach conducted through existing programs and agencies. T he purposes of all of these activities is to build networks and coalitions of persons who can inform individuals about the availability of ALL Kids and what it has to offer, and assist individuals in completing application forms. Outreach is conducted by a variety of individuals and in a variety of settings. Each feature of the three -pronged outreach approach is described below: Statewide media campaigns and initiatives - The media campaigns focus on informing individuals about the availability of ALL Kids and what they have to offer as well as providing information regarding where applications or other information may be obtained. Additionally, ALL Kids staff attend a wide variety of association meetings and conferences to inform memberships of the a vailability of children's health insurance. The staff have developed specialized outreach materials (from videos to informational brochures and flyers to specific handouts) for specific groups to meet their needs. Staff have exhibited at booths and pre sentations to the Medical Association of the State of Alabama, Alabama Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Family Practice Physicians, Dentists, Social Workers, Department of Human Resources staff, Mental Health staff, Family Law Judges, Hospitals, Hospital auxiliaries, WIC staff, Public Health Staff, etc. Outreach conducted by multi -county regional workers and consultants - since the Spring of 2002, ALL Kids consultants have been and/are employed throughout the state, to disseminate informat ion about the program to develop coalitions and networks of Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 47 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 local residents to assist individuals in completing and submitting applications. These regional coordinators, their supervisory directors, and consultants are many times based in the county healt h departments but also utilize numerous off -site locales and alternative working hours. Outreach conducted through existing programs and agencies - Information about CHIP, applications, and application assistance are available through existing child -related programs such as the Child Care Management Agencies and their targeted child day care centers, Food Stamps, Maternal and Child Health Block Grant Program clinics, WIC clinics, community health centers, Indian Health Services, school nurse programs, school counselor programs, Early Intervention programs , other social service agencies, etc. These programs and agencies have successful histories of serving the target population and the CHIP program utilizes their contact with this population to broaden outreach efforts. Dissemination of CHIP information to these entities has been facilitated since representatives of these agencies and programs served on the CHIP Advisory Council and continue to be in contact with CHIP as stakeholders. With specific reg ard to the Conception to Birth expansion and the RIM HSI, the ADPH will provide information to pertinent providers, hospitals and programs serving the target population residing in the counties in which the expansion is implemented. Phase III - ALL Kids PLUS Outreach for this special population is conducted primarily by the ALL Kids PLUS authorizing agencies. Outreach includes educating primary and specialty care physicians regarding ALL Kids PLUS, identifying and contacting children who may need PLUS services through reviews of agency rolls and possible reviews of the pediatric health histories (part of the application process), contact with community health centers, etc. Information about ALL Kids PLUS is incorporated into all publications and presentations. In an effort to continually improve the ALL Kids PLUS, CHIP staff continue to meet with the ALL Kids PLUS participating agencies to identify and resolve any problematic areas and to recruit additional participating agencies. PLUS agencies assist the CHIP staff in developing contracts, performance standards, and procedures for ongoing monitoring and oversight of the ALL Kids PLUS program. NOTE: The application form and other materials have been translated into Spanish. Additionally, the ALL Kid s enrollment unit employs a Spanish- speaking staff member and a Hispanic consultant has been hired to develop a Hispanic outreach plan. Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 48 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 Section 6 . Coverage Requirements for Children's Health Insurance Check here if the State elects to use funds provided under Title XXI only to provide expanded eligibility under the State's Medicaid plan and proceed to Section 7 since children covered under a Medicaid expansion program will receive all Medicaid covered services including EPSDT . 6.1. The State elects to provide the following forms of coverage to children: (Check all that apply.) (Section 2103(c)); (42CFR 457.410(a)) Guidance: Benchmark coverage is substantially equal to the benefits coverage in a benchmark benefit package (FEHBP -equivalent coverage, State employee coverage, and/or the HMO coverage plan that has the largest insured commercial, non -Medicaid enrollment in the state) . If box below is checked, either 6.1.1.1., 6.1.1.2., or 6.1.1.3. must also be checked. (Section (Section 2103(a)(1) and 42 CFR 457.420) Guidance: Check box below if the benchmark benefit package to be offered by the State is the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield preferred provider option service benefit plan, as described in and offered under Section 8903(1) of Title 5, United States Code attach copy of the plan.)

(Section 2103(b)(2)) 6.1.1.2. State employee coverage; (Section 2103(b)(2)) (If checked, identify the plan and attach a copy of the benefits description.) Guidance: Check box below if the benchmark benefit package to be offered by the State is offered by a health maintenance organization (as defined in Section 2791(b)(3) of the Public Health Services Act) and has the largest insured commercial, non- Medicaid enrollment of covered lives of such coverage plans offered by an HMO i n the state. (Section 2103(b)(3) (42 CFR 457.420(c))) Effect ive Date: October Approval Date: April 22, 2022 6.1.1.3. HMO with largest insured commercial enrollment (Section 2103(b)(3)) (If checked, identify the plan and attach a copy of the benefits description.) The benefit package offered by the health maintenance organization with the largest insured commercial, non -Medicaid enrollment of covered lives was selected after severa l well attended public meetings where the benefits of the three benchmark plans were compared with the assistance of the insurers/administrators for the three plans. The benefit plan was altered slightly to make it more appropriate for children's needs. In addition to the ALL Kids basic benefits package, additional benefits may be available for enrollees who have special needs. These additional benefits are known as ALL Kids PLUS benefits and are only available as prescribed by ALL Kids PLUS authorizing agencies. These decisions regarding what benefits are provided, the requirements for their receipt, and the provision of the benefits is under the auspices of the PLUS authorizing state agencies. These state agencies are those with which CHIP has a con tract for the provision of ALL Kids PLUS services, those agencies that ordinarily serve children with special health care conditions and needs, and which provide the matching funds for federal CHIP funding The ALL Kids benefits plan is described in the AL L Kids Summary Plan Description (SPD), which is available upon request. The benefit package for enrollees in the CHIP Medicaid expansion will be identical to other children enrolled in comprehensive Medicaid categories. Guidance: States choosing Benchmark -equivalent coverage must check the box below and ensure that the coverage meet s the following requirements: the coverage includes benefits for items and services within each of the categories of basic services described in 42 CFR 457.430: dental services inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physicians' services, surgical and medical services, laboratory and x -ray services, well-baby and well -child care, including age- appropriate immunizations, and emergency services; the coverage has an aggregate actuarial value that is at least actuarially equivalent to one of the benchmark benefit packages (FEHBP -equivalent coverage, State employee coverage, or coverage offered through an HMO coverage plan that has the largest insured commercial enrollment in the state); and the coverage has an actuarial value that is equal to at least 75 percent of the actuarial value of the additional categories in such packa ge, if offered, as Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 50 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 described in 42 CFR 457.430: coverage of prescription drugs , mental health services, vision services and hearing services. If 6.1.2. is checked, a signed actuarial memorandum must be attached. The actuary who prepares the opinion must select and specify the standardized set and population to be used under paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of 42 CFR 457.431. The State must provide sufficient detail to explain the basis of the methodologies used to estimate the actuarial value or, if requested by CMS, to replicate the State results. The actuarial report must be p repared by an individual who is a member of the American Academy of Actuaries. This report must be prepared in accordance with the principles and standards of the American Academy of Actuaries . In preparing the report, the actuary must use generally accept ed actuarial principles and methodologies, use a standardized set of utilization and price factors, use a standardized population that is representative of privately insured children of the age of children who are expected to be covered under the State child health plan, apply the same principles and factors in comparing the value of different coverage (or categories of services), without taking into account any differences in coverage based on the method of delivery or means of cost control or utilization used, and take into account the ability of a State to reduce benefits by taking into account the increase in actuarial value of benefits coverage offered under the State child health plan that results from the limitations on cost sharing under such covera ge. (Section 2103(a)(2)) 42 CFR 457.430) Specify the coverage, including the amount, scope and duration of each service, as well as any exclusions or limitations . Attach a signed actuarial report that meets the requirements specified in 42 CFR 457.431. Guidance: A State approved under the provision below, may modify its program from time to time so long as it continues to provide coverage at least equal to the lower of the actuarial val ue of the coverage under the program as of August 5, 1997, or one of the benchmark programs . If \"existing comprehensive state- based coverage\" is modified, an actuarial opinion documenting that the actuarial value of the modification is greater than the val ue as of August 5, 1997, or one of the benchmark plans must be attached. Also, the fiscal ye ar 1996 State expenditures for \" existing comprehensive state- based coverage\" must be described in the space provided for all states . (Section 2103(a)(3)) Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 51 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 6.1.3.

Guidance: Secretary -approved coverage refers to any other health benefits coverage deemed appropriate and acceptable by the Secretary upon application by a state. (Section 2103(a)(4)) (42 CFR 457.250) Section 1905(r) of the Act defines EPSDT to require coverage of (1) any medically necessary screening, and diagnostic services, including vision, hearing, and dental screening and diagnostic services, consistent with a periodicity schedule based on current and reasonable medical practice standards or the health needs of an individual child to determine if a suspected condition or illness exists ; and (2) all services listed in section 1905(a) of the Act that are necessary to correct or ameliorate any defects and mental and physical illnesses or conditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not those services are covered under the Medicaid state plan . Secti on 1902(a)(43) of the Act requires that the State (1) provide and arrange for all necessary services, including supportive services , such as transportation, needed to receive medical care included within the scope of the EPSDT benefit and (2) inform eligib le beneficiaries about the services available under the EPSDT benefit. If the coverage provided does not meet all of the statutory requirements for EPSDT contained in sections 1902(a)(43) and 1905(r) of the Act, do not check this box . 6.1.4.1. Coverage of all benefits that are provided to children that is the same as the benefits provided under the Medicaid State plan, including Early Periodic Screening , Diagnos tic, and Treatment (EPSDT) . 6.1.4.2. Comprehensive coverage for children under a Medicaid Section 1115 demonstration wai ver. Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 52 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 6.1.4.3. Coverage that the State has extended to the entire Medicaid population. Guidance: Check below if the coverage offered includes benchmark coverage, as specified in \u00a7 457.420, plus additional coverage . Under this option, the State must clearly demonstrate that the coverage it provides includes the same coverage as the benchmark package, and also describes the services that are being added to the benchmark package. 6.1.4.4. Coverage that includes benchmark coverage plus additional coverage . In the second amendment to the Alabama CHIP State Plan, ALL Kids PLUS was established which provided additional benefits for children with special health care conditions/needs. Attachment A contains a detailed description of the ALL Kids PLUS component of CHIP. 6.1.4.5. Coverage that is the same as defined by existing comprehensive state - based coverage applicable only in New York, Pennsylvania or Florida . (under 42 CFR 457.440) Guidance: Check below if the State is purchasing coverage through a group health plan, and intends to demonstrate that the group health plan is substantially equivalent to or greater than coverage under one of the benchmark plans specified in 457.420, through the use of a benefit -by- benefit comparison of the coverage . Provide a sample of the comparison format that will be used . Under this option, if coverage for any benefit does not meet or exceed the coverage for that benefit under the benchmark, the State must provide an actuarial analysis as described in457.431 to determine actuarial equivalence. 6.1.4.6. Coverage under a group health plan that is substantially equivalent to or greater than benchmark coverage through a benefit by benefit comparison ( Provide a s ample of how the comparison will be done) . Guidance: Check below if the State elects to provide a source of coverage that is not described above. Describe the coverage that will be offered, including any benefit limitations or exclusions. 6.1.4.7. Other . (Describe) Comprehensive health coverage will be provided from conception to birth for those with family incomes up to and including 312% FPL, whose mothers do not have comprehensive coverage, and reside in select counties in geographic areas in Alabama where CHIP un born coverage is available. Prenatal care, labor and delivery and limited postpartum care are paid using a bundled payment. In addition to the bundled payment, the state will provide comprehensive coverage during the postpartum period through ALL Babies H SI Initiative. Coverage begins upon enrollment and will Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 53 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 continue until the last day of the month in which the 60 day postpartum period has elapsed after the end of a pregnancy. For example, if a woman gives birth on June 26, benefits covered in the bundled package or postpartum HSI would end on August 31. The first day without coverage would be September 1. The date of enrollment may be as early as the first day of maternity -related service provision even if the application is completed a few days after t he service is received. In other cases coverage will begin on the date the application is received by the CHIP office. The definition of comprehensive coverage includes coverage for obstetrical benefits. If a pregnant woman has other coverage but the ot her coverage does not include obstetrical benefits, then the other coverage would be considered non -comprehensive, regardless of any other benefits it insures. In this circumstance, the pregnant woman would meet the criterion for not having comprehensive coverage. Guidance: All forms of coverage that the State elects to provide to children in its plan must be checked . The State should also describe the scope, amount and duration of services covered under its plan, as well as any exclusions or limitations . States that choose to cover unborn children under the State plan should include a separate section 6.2 that specifies benefits for the unborn child population. (Section 2110(a)) (42CFR, 457.490) If the state elects to cover the new option of targeted l ow income pregnant women, but chooses to provide a different benefit package for these pregnant women under the CHIP plan, the state must include a separate section 6.2 describing the benefit package for pregnant women. (Section 2112) 6.2. The State elects to provide the following forms of coverage to children: (Check all that apply. If an item is checked, describe the coverage with respect to the amount, duration and scope of services covered, as well as any exclusions or limitations) (Section 2110(a)) (42CFR 457.490) A description of the scope, amount and duration of services covered under ALL Kids and ALL Kids PLUS, as well as any exclusions and limitations can be found in the ALL Kids Summary Plan Description (SPD) which is available upon request. Health insurance benefits provided to conception to birth enrollees will be identical to the health insurance benefits provided to any pregnant ALL Kids enrollee. The date of enrollment may be as early as the first day of maternity- related service provision even if the application is completed a few days after the service is received. In other cases coverage will begin on the date the application is received by the CHIP office. Prenatal care, labor and delivery and limited postpartum care are paid using a bundled payment . In addition to the bundled payment, the state will provide comprehensive coverage during the postpartum period through ALL Babies HSI Initiative. In geographic areas in Alabama where CHIP unborn coverage is available, coverage for bundled obstetrical benefits begins upon enrollment and will continue until the last day of the month in which the 60 day postpartum period has elapsed after the end of a pregnancy. For example, if a woman gives birth on June 26, benefits covered in the Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 54 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 bundled package or postpartum HSI would end on August 31. The first day without coverage would be September 1. 6.2.1. Inpatient services (Se ction 2110(a)(1)) 6.2.2. 6.2.4. Surgical services (Section 2110(a)(4)) 6.2.5.

Reimbursement for services delivered to ALL Kids' enrollees is paid based on the preferred dent al network fee schedule. All network dentists agree to accept this as payment in full, with the exception of enrollee co -pays (no copay ments on preventive or diagnostic services). When costs are expected to exceed $1500 for a calendar year, ALL Kids utilizes a prior authorization process to ensure medically necessary services are provided. Costs associated with diagnostic and preventive services are excluded from this $1500 threshold. The amount is calculated by totaling the amount paid in dental cl aims minus the amount paid for preventive and diagnostic dental services. If an enrollee is in need of dental services beyond $1500 in a calendar year, providers are instructed to submit a predetermination request to BCBS. BCBS reviews all provider requests to determine dental necessity of services and ALL Kids provides final approval to pay for services exceeding $1500. Providers are familiar with this process and dentally necessary services are provided in a timely manner regardless of the time of year. There is no unnecessary carry -over of services that need immediate attention. If a family would like to appeal the BCBS/ALL Kids decision regarding the application of \"medically necessary,\" there is an appeals process which is consistent with the requ irements of 42 CFR 457.1160 (b) and in compliance with state laws, the Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and all other applicable regulations of the Department of Labor Procedures. 6.2.1.1- DC Periodicity Schedule.

If not all the covered populations are offered EPSDT, The State must conduct a parity analysis of the benefit packages provided to those populations . Please continue to 6.2.3 - MHPAEA. Mental Health Parity Analysis Requirements for States Not Providing EP SDT to All Covered Populations Guidance: The State must complete a parity analysis for each population under the State child health plan that is not provid ed the EPSDT benefit consistent with the requirements 42 CFR 457.496(b ). If the State provides benefits or limitations that vary within the child or pregnant woman populations, states should perform a parity analysis for each of the benefit packag es. For example, if different financial requirements are applied according to a beneficiary 's income , a separate parity analysis is needed for the benefit package provided at each income level. Please ensure that changes made to benefit limitations under the State child health plan as a result of the parity a nalysis are also made in Section 6.2. 6.2.3- MHPAEA In order to conduct the parity analysis, the State must place all medical/surgical and mental health and substance use disorder benefits covered under the State child health plan into one of four classifications : Inpatient, outpatient, emergency care, and prescription drugs 42 describe below the standard(s) used to place covered benefits into one of the four classifications.

More specifically, the State must determine the ratio of (a) the dollar amount of all payments expected to be paid under the State plan for medical and surgical benefits within a classification which are subject to the type of quantitative treatment limitation for the plan year (or portion of the plan year after a mid -year change affecting the applicability of a type of quantitative treatment limitation to any medical/surgical benefits in the class) to (b) the dollar amount expected to be paid for all medical and surgical benefits within th e classification for the plan year . For purposes of this paragraph, all payments expected to be paid under the State plan includes payments expected to be made directly by the State and payments which are expected to be made by MCEs contracting with the S tate. ( 42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(i)( C)) The State assures it has applied a reasonable methodology to determine the dollar amounts used in the ratio described above for each classification within which the State applies QTLs to mental health or substance use disorder benefits.

(42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(i)( A)) Yes No Guidance: If the State does not apply a type of QTL to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in a given classification of benefits, The St ate may n ot impose that type of QTL on mental health or substance use disorder benefits in that classification. ( 42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(i)(A)) 6.2.5.3.1- MHPAEA For each type of QTL applied to mental health or substance use disorder benefits, t he State must determine the predominant level of that type which is applied to medical/surgical benefits in the classification. The \"predominant level\" of a type of QTL in a classification is the level (or least restrictive of a combination of levels) that applie s to more than one -half of the medical/surgical benefits in that classification, as described in 42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(i)(B).The portion of medical/surgical benefits in a classification to which a given level of a QTL type is applied is based on the dollar amount of payments expected to be paid for medical/surgical benefits subject to that level as compared to all medical/surgical benefits in the classification, as described in 42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(i)(C). For each type of quantitative treatment limitation ap plied to mental health or substance use disorder benefits, the State assures : The same reasonable methodology applied in determining the dollar amounts used to determine whether substantially all medical/surgical benefits within a classification are subject to a type of quantitative treatment limitation also is applied in determining the dollar amounts used to determine the predominant level of a type of quantitative treatment limitation applied to medical/surgical benefits within a classification.

Section 7 . Quality and Appropriateness of Care Guidance: Methods for Evaluating and Monitoring Quality- Methods to assure quality include the application of performance measures, quality standards consumer information strategies, and other quality improvement strategies. Performance measurement strategies could include using measurements for external reporting either to the State or to consumers and for internal quality improvement purposes . They could be based on existing measurement sets that have undergone rigorous evaluation for their appropriateness (e.g., HEDIS) . They may include the use of standardized member satisfaction surveys (e.g., CAHPS) to assess members ' experience of care alo ng key dimensions such as access, satisfaction, and system performance. Quality standards are often used to assure the presence of structural and process measures that promote quality and could include such approaches as: the use of external and periodic review of health plans by groups such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance; the establishment of standards related to consumer protection and quality such as those developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners; and the formation of an advisory group to the State or plan to facilitate consumer and community participation in the plan. Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 88 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 Information strategies could include: the disclosure of information to beneficiaries about their benefits under the plan and their rights and responsibilities; the provision of comparative information to consumers on the performance of available health plans and providers; and consumer education strategies on how to access and effectively use health insurance coverage to maximize q uality of care. Quality improvement strategies sh ould include the establishment of quantified quality improvement goals for the plan or the State and provider education. Other strategies include specific purchasing specifications, ongoing contract monit oring mechanisms, focus groups, etc. Where States use managed care organizations to deliver CHIP care, recent legal changes require the State to use managed care quality standards and quality strategies similar to those used in Medicaid managed care. Tools for Evaluating and Monitoring Quality- Tools and types of information available include, HEDIS (Health Employer Data Information Set) measures, CAHPS (Consumer Assessments of Health Plans Study) measures , vital statistics data, and State health registries (e.g., immunization registries). Quality monitoring may be done by external quality review organizations, or, if the State wishes, internally by a State board or agency independent of the State CHIP Agency . Establishing grievance measures is also an important aspect of monitoring. Check here if the State elects to use funds provided under Title XXI only to provide expanded eligibility under the State's Medicaid plan, and continue on to Section 8. Guidance: The State must specify the qualifications of entities that will provide coverage and the conditions of participation. States should also define the quality standard they are using, for example, NCQA Standards or other professional standards . Any description of the information strat egies used should be linked to S ection 9 . (Section 2102(a)( 7)(A)) (42CFR 457.495) 7.1. Describe the methods (including external and internal monitoring) used to assure the quality and appropriateness of care, particularly with respect to well -baby care, well - child care, and immuniza tions provided under the plan. ( Section 2102(a)(7)(A)) (42CFR 457.495(a)) Will the State utilize any of the following tools to assure quality? (Check all that apply and describe the activities for any categories utilized.) The State utilizes the expertise within the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) School of Public Health in the implementation of the assessment of the ALL Kids program. Quality and appropriateness of care is assessed through the use of surveys such as a new enrollee survey, a conti nuous enrollee survey, and a disenrollee survey. Both process measures as well Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 89 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 as outcome measures are considered when assessing the quality and appropriateness of care. CHIP also reviews claims data for quality assessment. Among the items used in track ing are the use of several claims data indicators such as whether or not children truly have a \"medical home\"; how well they are adhering to the recommended scheduled well -child exams; whether or not they are appropriately immunized; whether or not non -trauma based emergency room use is going down; how referrals are being made and if specialty care and related services are being received; and, patterns of prescription drug use. The State is also considering using other databases that can provide general i ndicators of child health and well -being such as the State's immunization registry, adolescent pregnancy rates and health care utilization patterns identifiable off birth certificates, and the results of child death review efforts. Alabama monitors custom er/patient/provider satisfaction through the use of surveys and informal communications with families, advocacy groups, and providers. In addition to these monitoring strategies, the State assures access to care through monitoring of the provider network and benefit package design. Program staff are actively involved in identifying new providers for the ALL Kids network and have been particularly involved in the addition of pediatric dentists, primary care nurse practitioners, community mental health centers and emergency transportation providers. Geographic distribution of providers is monitored and is crucial when decisions regarding vendor choice are made. The ALL Kids benefits package requires preauthorization only for hospitalization services. Therefore, access to all primary care providers and specialists is open to all enrollees without referral. Claims data are monitored by program staff to ensure qua lity and appropriateness of care. In addition, the State employs a masters level social worker to assist families who are experiencing difficulties accessing necessary services due to benefit structure or provider geographic availability. This staff mem ber works closely with case managers at the vendor to identify areas in need of attention and provides the State with recommendations for benefit plan adjustment and/or provider network issues. The ALL Kids PLUS program coordinates the evaluation of quality and appropriateness of care with the ALL Kids PLUS authorizing agencies and CSHCC/N advocacy groups through collaboration with stakeholders. It is also anticipated that an evaluation of ALL Kids PLUS may become part of the UAB evaluation in the fut ure. 7.1.1. Quality standards . Performance measurement 7.1.2 (a) CHIPRA Quality Core Set 7.1.2 (b) Other Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 90 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 The State ensures quality through contracted performance measures.

Quality improvement strategies The performance guarantees and provider recoupment policy were included in the RFP and are included in the co ntract with the health plan. Guidance: Provide a brief description of methods to be used to assure access to covered services, including a description of how the State will assure the quality and appropriateness of the care provided . The State should consider whether there are sufficient providers of care for the newly enrolled populations and whether there is reasonable access to care. (Section 2102(a)(7)(B)) 7.2.

Access to covered services, including emergency services as defined in 42 CFR 457.10. (Section 2102(a)(7)) 42CFR 457.495(b)) Access is monitored through a number of methods including the following: Quarterly review of claims data Quarterly review of new enrollee, continuous enrollee, and disenrollee survey data Feedback from families via telephone, e- mail, and postal service mail Feedback from providers Feedback from the CHIP Social Work Consultant Further, the state uses claims data to monitor emergency room use as is described in 7.1. Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 91 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 7.2.3. Appropriate and timely procedures to monitor and treat enrollees with chronic, complex, or serious medical conditions, including access to an adequate number of visits to specialists experienced in treating the specific medical condition and access to out-of-network providers when the network is not adequate for the enrollee's medical condition. (Section 2102(a)(7)) (42CFR 457.495(c)) Access is monitored through a number of methods including the following: Periodic review of the number and types of providers by county Quarterly review of claims data Quarterly review of new enrollee, continuous enrollee, and disenrollee survey data Feedback from families via telephone, e- mail, and post service mail Feedback from providers Feedback from CSHCC/N advocates and ALL Kids PLUS providers The ALL Kids PLUS network includes State agencies that serve children with special health care needs/conditions and that contract with CHIP to provide state matching funds for ALL Kids enrollees who use PLUS services. Currently, Children Rehabilitation Services is the only active PLUS program. The PLUS agency provides ALL Kids children with an individual case manager who will monitor access to specialists and treatment. In general, the Medicaid standards will be used to establish qualifications for ALL Kids PLUS case management staff. All case management staff will meet specific qualifications, including education, training and appropriate credentialing which will be established by the participating agencies. In most circumstances, the agencies' delivery systems are discrete and clear which program provides services for specific conditions. However, where there is potential for overlap in responsibilities, the determination of which agency will provide case management will be done based on the needs of the child with input from the family and by determining what is in the best interest of the child. The agencies using the case management process, will coordinate with each other, the child, the family, and the care providers in determining if a change i n case management is needed. 7.2.4. Decisions related to the prior authorization of health services are completed in accordance with State law or, in accordance with the medical needs of the patient, within 14 days after the receipt of a request for servi ces. (Section 2102(a)(7)) (42CFR 457.495(d)) Exigent medical circumstances may require more rapid response according to the medical needs of the patient. The health plan vendor has policies in place to assure that prior authorization of health services are completed in accordance with state law or regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor. CHIP staff receive feedback from providers and enrollee families if time periods are exceeded. All prior authorization of health services is in accordance wit h state laws. Children Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 92 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 enrolled in a Medicaid expansion are subject to the same prior authorization policies to which children enrolled in Medicaid's other full service children's programs are subject.

For eac h type of financial requirement applied to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in a classification, the State assures : The same reasonable methodology applied in determining the dollar amounts used in determining whether substantially all medical/surgical benefits within a classification are sub ject to a type of financial requirement also is applied in determining the dollar amounts used to determine the predominant level of a type of financial requirement applied to medical/surgical benefits within a classification. ( 42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(i)(E)) The level of each type of financial requirement applied by the State to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification is no more restrictive than the predomina nt level of that type which is applied by the State to medical/surgical benefits within the same classification. ( 42 CFR 457.496(d)(2)(i)) Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 100 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 Guidance: If there is no single level of a type of financial requirement that exceeds the one- half threshold, the State may combine levels within a type of financial requirement such that the combined levels are applied to at least half o f all medical/surgical benefits within a classification; the predomin ant level is the least restrictive level of the levels combined to meet the one- half threshold. ( 42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(i)(B)(2)) 8.5. Describe how the State will ensure that the annual aggregate cost -sharing for a family does not exceed 5 percent of such family's income for the length of the child's eligibility period in the State . Include a description of the procedures that do not primarily rely on a refund given by the State for overp ayment by an enrollee: (Section 2103(e)(3)(B)) (42CFR 457.560(b) and 457.505(e)) Alabama ensures that the annual aggregate cost -sharing for a family does not exceed five percent (5%) of a family's income as is required by Section 2103(3)(B) of Title XX I. In addition, cost sharing, both premiums and copayments are in compliance with CHIP regulations. There is minimal cost sharing for families, other than Native Americans and Alaskan Natives who have no cost sharing. No family is charged for more than three (3) premiums even if the family has more than three children. To protect families against excessive medical expenses and comply with the statutory limit of no more than five percent of family income being expended on cost sharing expenses, families will be notified in writing, at initial enrollment and renewal, of the annual out of pocket maximum . Families are informed of this policy through educational literature. Also, CHIP staff and partners are trained to educate families about the limit on out of pocket expenses. Families are encouraged to keep receipts for all copayments and premiums so that once the out of pocket maximum is reached they will have the necessary documentation to stop cost -sharing. If a family reaches this limit and notifies the ALL Kids program, ALL Kids will review the case and if the limit has been reached new insurance cards will be issued stating that the child(ren) are not subject to further co -pays for the coverage period. 8.6. Describe the procedures the State will use to ensure American Indian (as defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976) and Alaska Native children will be excluded from cost -sharing . (Section 2103(b)(3)(D)) (42CFR 457.535) If a child is identified on an application as an American Indian, the enrollment worker automatically places the child in the no -fee category if the child becomes enrolled. Therefore the insurance vendor sends an insurance card, to the family, which indicates that the child is not subject to any co -pays. 8.7. Provide a description of the consequences for an enrollee or applicant who does not Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 101 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 pay a charge. (42CFR 457.570 and 457.505(c)) Superseded by ACA SPA Guidance: Section 8.7.1is based on Section 2101(a) of the Act provides that the purpose of title XXI is to provide funds to States to enable them to initiate and expand the provision of child health assistance to uninsured, low -income children in an effective and efficient manner that is coordinated with other sources of health benefits coverage for children. 8.7.1. Provide an assurance that the following disenrollment protections are being applied: Guidance: Provide a description below of the State's premium grace period process and how the State notifies families of their rights and respo nsibilities with respect to payment of premiums. (Section 2103(e)(3)(C)) 8.7.1.1. State has established a process that gives enrollees reasonable no tice of and an opportunity to pay past due premiums, copayments, coinsurance, deductibles or similar fees prior to disenrollment.(42CFR 457.570(a)) ALL Kids has an annual premium for those in cost sharing categories. Upon enrollment, families are notified, by letter, that premiums are due. Enrollees have the entire 12 -month coverage period to pay premium balances and receipt of benefits is not contingent upon payment of premiums. Current enrollees are not terminated for non -payment of premium during the 12 -month coverage period. At one month, four months, seven months, and 10 months, families are notified of outstanding premium balances. They are notified, every notice for past -due premiums and cost -sharing , that, in most circumstances, premiums must be paid in full for ALL Kids coverage to be renewed. If a renewal application is received within 90 days past the coverage end date (and the premium is paid no later than 90 days past the coverage end date), enrollees may renew with no lapse in coverage. 8.7.1.2. The disenrollment process affords the enrollee an opportunity to show that the enrollee's family income has declined prior to disenrollment for non- payment of cost -sharing charges . (42CFR 457.570(b)) The amount of family income written on the renewal form is reviewed by enrollment workers at the time of renewal. If it is known to ALL Kids that a family is experiencing financial difficulty, the ALL Kids Social Work Consultant and/or ALL Kids Regional staff may assist the family in locating assistance for premium payment. Non -payment of pre miums is forgiven if the family provides proof of bankruptcy status during the enrollment period or if the family has been affected by disaster events (living or working in FEMA or Governor declared disaster areas at the time of a disaster event). 8.7.1.3. In the instance mentioned above, that t he State will facilitate enrolling Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 102 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 the child in Medicaid or adjust the child's cost -sharing category as appropriate. (42CFR 457.570(b)) At the time of renewal, if the family's income has dropped but is still above the Medicaid eligibility level, if the dec ision is made to forgive the unpaid premium(s), the child is renewed and placed in the appropriate ALL Kids category. If a family's income has dropped below the ALL Kids eligibility, the child's application is reviewed for Medicaid eligibility and, if th e child meets all eligibility requirements, s/he is enrolled in Medicaid. 8.7.1.4 The State provides the enrollee with an opportunity for an impartial review to address disenrollment from the program . (42CFR 457.570(c)) This type of grievance is handled in the same impartial manner in which other grievances are handled as described in Attachment A . 8.8. The State assures that it has made the following findings with respect to the payment aspects of its plan: (Section 2103(e)) 8.8.1. No Federal funds will be used toward State matching requirements . (Section 2105(c)(4)) (42CFR 457.220) 8.8.2. No cost -sharing (including premiums, deductibles, copayments, coinsurance and all other types) will be used toward State matching requirements . (Section 2105(c)(5) (42CFR 457.224) (Previously 8.4.5) 8.8.3. No funds under this title will be used for coverage if a private insurer would have been obligated to provide such assistance except for a provision limiting this obligation because the child is eligible under the this title . (Section 2105(c)(6)(A)) (42CFR 457.626(a)(1)) 8.8.4. Income and resource standards and methodologies for determining Medicaid eligibility are not more restrictive than those applied as of June 1, 1997. (Section 2105(d)(1)) (42CFR 457.622(b)(5)) 8.8.5. No funds provided under this title or coverage funded by this title will include coverage of abortion except if necessary to save the life of the mother or if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest . (Section 2105)(c)(7)(B)) (42CFR 457.475) 8.8.6. No funds provided under this title will be used to pay for any abortion or to assist in the purchase, in whole or in part, for coverage that includes abortion (except as described above) . (Section 2105)(c)(7)(A)) (42CFR 457.475) Section 9 . Strategic Objectives and Performance Goals and Plan Administration Guidance: States should consider aligning its strategic objectives with those discussed in Section II of the CHIP Annual Report. Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 103 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 9.1. Describe strategic objectives for increasing the extent of creditable health coverage among targeted low -income children and other low -income children: (Section 2107(a)(2)) (42CFR 457.710(b)) 1. Reduce the number of uninsured children 2. Increase access to care 3. Increase the use of preventative care Guidance: Goals should be measurable, quantifiable and convey a target the State is working towards . 9.2. Specify one or more performance goals for each strategic objective identified: (Section 2107(a)(3)) (42CFR 457.710(c)) 1. Performance Goals for Objective 1: 1.1: The percentage of low -income uninsured children will be maintained at less than, or equal to 4% of all children in AL 1.2: The percentage of low -income uninsured children in Medicaid's income eligibility range will be maintained at less than or equal to 6% 1.3: CHIP Population Uninsured - the percentage of uninsured children in the ALL Kids in come eligibility range will be maintained at less than, or equal to 6% 2. Performance Goals for Objective 2 2.1: Access to Physicians - two or more physicians within 20 miles of the place of residence for at least 95% of ALL Kids enrollees 2.2: Urban Access to Dental Care - for at least 95% of those residing in an urban area to have access to two or more dentists within ten miles of their residence 2.3: Suburban Access to Dental Care - for at least 95% of those residing in a suburban area to have access to two or more dentists within 15 miles of their residence 2.4: Rural Access to Dental Care - for at least 95% of those residing in a rural area to have access to at least one dentist within 25 miles of their residence 2.5: Children Access to Primary Care Ph ysicians - at least 90% of children and adolescents who have had no more than one gap in enrollment will have at least one primary care physician visit annually 3. Performance Goal for Objective 3: 3.1: Doctor Communication on Prevention - at least 95% of total CAHPS survey respondents reported that their primary care physician usually, or always, explained their health in a way that was easy to understand 3.2: Getting Needed Care - at least 95% of total CAHPS survey respondents reported that it was usually , or always, easy to get access to care, test, or treatments within the last six months 3.3: Annual Dental Visits - at least 75% of enrollees, between the ages of two and 19 had at least one dental visit during the year Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 104 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 Guidance: The State should include data sources to be used to assess each performance goal . In addition, check all appropriate measures from 9.3.1 to 9.3.8 that the State will be utilizing to measure performance, even if doing so duplicates what the State has already discussed in Section 9. It is acceptable for the State to include performance measures for population subgroups chosen by the State for special emphasis, such as racial or ethnic minorities, particular high- risk or hard to reach populations, children with special needs, etc. HEDIS (Health Employer Data and Information Set) 2008 contains performance measures relevant to children and adolescents younger than 19. In addition, HEDIS 3.0 contains measures for the general population, for which breakouts by children's age bands (e.g., ages < 1, 1- 9, 10- 19) are required. Full definitions, explanations of data sources, and other important guidance on the use of HEDIS measures can be found in the HEDIS 2008 manual publis hed by the National Committee on Quality Assurance . So that State HEDIS results are consistent and comparable with national and regional data, states should check the HEDIS 2008 manual for detailed definitions of each measure, including definitions of the numerator and denominator to be used. For states that do not plan to offer managed care plans, HEDIS measures may also be able to be adapted to organizations of care other than managed care . 9.3. Describe how performance under the plan will be measured through objective, independently verifiable means and compared against performance goals in order to determine the State's performance, taking into account suggested performance indicators as specified below or other indicators the State develops: (Sectio n 2107(a)(4)(A),(B)) (42CFR 457.710(d)) Assurance of an Objective Means for Measuring Performance The State assures to use reliable, independent data sources to assist in conducting an objective evaluation of all performance measures. At a minimum, evaluation will be conducted annually to determine progress in meeting objectives.

Formalized CHIP development groups were the CHIP Commission and the CHIP Task Force Work Groups. The CHIP Commission met three times, October 7, November 12 and December 17, 1998. The CHIP Task Force Work Groups met twelve times beginning August 6, 1998, and split into subcommittees to develop proposals in the following areas: (1) benefits, (2) eligibility, outreach and enrollment, and (3) funding. These subcommittee meetings were open to interested individuals and groups. At least three news conferences were held by the State Health Officer and/or the Medicaid Commissioner. Public awareness was promoted through means such as television programs. Interes ted organizations such as Alabama ARISE, the Alabama Developmental Disabilities Planning Council, and Voices for Alabama's Children were provided information for their membership about CHIP. Media coverage was provided and CHIP information has been made available on the Internet at: http://www.adph.org/allkids (formerly: http://www.alapubhealth.org) since October 2, 1998. During the first six and one -half month period of October 4 through April 21, 1998, 1,247 h its were made on this site specifically requesting CHIP information. This website includes a description of the program, a calendar of scheduled events, and an opportunity for interested persons to express their opinions about the program's development. Or der forms are available at every presentation. These forms enable participants to fax orders to the ALL Kids office and receive printed materials at no charge. The largest number of requests for information (312) came during the month of January. Newspape r editorials have praised the value of this program for our State's children. The CHIP Task Force Work Groups were comprised of employees of the Alabama Medicaid Agency, Public Health Department employees, and other interested parties including representatives of the Alabama Primary Care Association, Alabama ARISE, the Alabama Devel opmental Disabilities Planning Council, Voices for Alabama's Children, the Alabama Child Caring Foundation, Alabama Dental Association, Alabama Hospital Association, Alabama Psychological Association, American Academy of Pediatrics -Alabama Chapter, Blue Cr oss Blue Shield, Children First, Children's Health System, Children's Hospital of Alabama, Family Voices, Health Maintenance Organization Association, Legislative Fiscal Office, Legislative Reference Service, Medical Association of the State of Alabama, University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of South Alabama, University of South Alabama Children's and Women's Hospital, United Health Care, as well as other State agencies including the Department of Education, the Department of Human Resources, the Department of Mental Health/Mental Retardation, State Employees' Insurance Board, State Insurance Department, and the Department of Rehabilitation Services. These entities are now referred to as stakeholders and they continue to be involved as Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 109 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 program changes are developed. The Alabama program will continue to inform the general public about CHIP through the news media, to announce planning meetings, and to invite additional groups with an interest in being involved or informed as they become identified . There was extensive public involvement in the preparation of a comprehensive 133 -page report which was released to the Alabama Legislature on January 12, 1998. In relation to the Governor's Task Force on Children's Health Insurance, periodic reports on the progress of recommendations contained the report are made. 9.9.1. Describe the process used by the State to ensure interaction with Indian Tribes and organizations in the State on the development and implementation of the procedures required in 42 CFR 457.125. States should provide notice and consultation with Tribes on proposed pregnant women expansions.( Section 2107(c)) (42CFR 457.120(c)) A meeting was held with representatives of the 2,176 member Poarch Band of Creek Indians, the only federally recognized Native American group in Alabama. Six other tribes are recognized by the State. The CHIP Program was explained and discussion centered on ways to coordinate CHIP and Indian Health Service -funded care, the role of traditional Native American healing , outreach methods for children and some demographics of the Poarch Band. Several presentations have been made to the Alabama Commission on Indian Affairs and CHIP staff meet and coordinate regularly with staff of the Commission. Other forms of outreach h ave included numerous presentations to the tribes, presence at Native American festivals throughout the state and the employment of a Native American consultant whose specific task was to develop a regionally-based outreach plan to the Native American population in Alabama. 9.9.2.

Effect ive Date: October 1, 2021 110 Approval Date: April 22, 2022 Alabama has no state law applicable to public notice of either cost sharing changes or waiting list implementations in CHIP. Public Notice of Cost Sharing Changes: Specific public notice was given via a meeting of CHIP stakeholders in August 2003 and letters to enrollees' families informing them of the changes in cost sharing. This meeting and the mailings followed much publicity in the state regarding the state's financial situation and the possible impact on CHIP if a statewide referendum to raise taxes on (September 9, 2003) did not pass. Public Notice of the Waiting List: ALL Kids initiated a waiting list beginning with all new enrollees who would have had an effective date October 1, 2003. Once the decision had been made to establish a waiting lis t, a press statement was released and letters were sent to stakeholders and other interested parties informing them of the institution of a waiting list and stressing the importance of returning renewal forms on time. Additionally, a letter to this effect was sent to every enrollee family along with a new insurance card(s). All of these notices were issued during the month of September 2003 prior to the impact of the waiting list. On August 23, 2004, ALL Kids reopened enrollment and discontinued use of the waiting list. If the State determines that it is again necessary to implement a waiting list, it will provide prior, appropriate public notice. There are no public notice state laws regarding enrollment caps and waiting lists in SCHIP. 9.9.3.
