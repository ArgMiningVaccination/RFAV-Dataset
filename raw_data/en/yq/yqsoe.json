This is very much dependant on the individual and what is being worked on. What Are Energy Detox Symptoms? The detox symptoms are always gentle and short-lived, and can range from: - mild cold-like symptoms, - body aches, - emotional release, - tearfulness, - tiredness, - strange dreams, - mental fog, - muscle twitches etc. Energy detox is not an illness and is not a sign that the energy work is making you ill. Energy detox is a sign that the attunement or treatment is working to clear anything non-serving from your energy bodies. This is why you would have decided to have a treatment or attunement in the first place to bring [healing](https://www.blissfullight.com/blogs/energy-healing-blog/what-does-healing-really-mean), balance, and support to your life. These symptoms show that you are doing just that. As such it is important not to be afraid of the symptoms, try and embrace them! Energy detox is mild and short lived. If you are experiencing significant symptoms or are unable to function, this must not be assumed to be energy detox. You should consult your doctor to ensure there is no underlying problem. How To Reduce The Symptoms Of Energy Detox Look at what symptoms you have, any dreams, emotions or thoughts that may be coming to the surface and mindfully acknowledge them as a result of the clearing and see what it is that you can clear or learn from it. Try not to label the emotion or thought or become attached to it. Remain detached and release it with love. While going through the clearing be gentle with yourself and try not to judge yourself for any reactions you may have as a result of any emotions or thoughts that come up. There are a few ways that you can reduce the symptoms felt and accelerate the clearing: - Be gentle and kind to yourself. - If you have been attuned, try and use the energy at least once a day. - Have energy healing treatments. - Drink plenty of water. - Take salt baths. - Eat healthy balanced meals. - Avoid alcohol and caffeine. - Rest and have early nights. - Want to release what is coming up to be cleared. - Don't hold onto or label what comes up. - Keep a dream journal to help focus on what needs to be released. - Remain in the present. Detox usually passes within a few hours or days. Congratulate yourself for releasing baggage and taking the next steps on your journey. One final note, if you ever feel that the symptoms are too much for you, ask your higher self to either stop the clearing for a while or reduce the symptoms. You are ultimately in control of your experiences and as such can control what you clear. "}
