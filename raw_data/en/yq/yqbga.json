Whether you are experiencing back pain, feeling out of alignment, or just want to get healthier, we can help. To help all of our patients, we offer the following services: Corrective Exercises Corrective exercises can help make any pain that you are experiencing go away and stay away. These exercises will strengthen and correct the irregularities of your body which may be causing your pain. Most of these exercises are able to be performed in the comfort of your own home. In addition to skeletal misalignment, muscles or connective tissues that are out of place can also cause pain. Wellness Care There are so many things you can do to become healthier. Many people think that becoming healthier means salads for every meal and exercising daily. We recommend that you start slow. What is one thing that you are doing every day that you could switch out for something healthier? Could you stop drinking that can of soda for dinner and instead grab a water bottle? Becoming healthier is all about making small changes. Chiropractic Adjustments A chiropractic adjustment can make you feel so much better. Your body does not want to be out of alignment, and that's exactly what an adjustment can help address. It is also known as chiropractic manipulation, manual manipulation, or spinal manipulation. The adjustment refers to the manipulation of the vertebrae that have abnormal movements and are not functioning properly. A chiropractic adjustment will assist in fixing these issues. Physical Therapy Physical therapy rehabilitation uses mechanical force and movement to improve mobility, function, and even quality of life through examination, diagnosis, prognosis, and physical intervention. Our physical therapists are trained and licensed to examine, evaluate, diagnose, and treat impairment, functional limitations, and disabilities in patients. Back Pain Chronic back pain is one of the biggest problems Americans face today. Back pain actually affects eight out of ten people at some point in their lives. Even though back pain is common, it is not all the same. Many different conditions can cause back pain and cause different areas of the back to hurt. These include sprained ligaments, strained muscles, trigger points, arthritis, ruptured disks, inflamed joins, sport injuries, and many more. Auto Accidents An auto accident can cause many different issues. Often an accident can throw your neck, your spine, or even your entire body out of alignment. Our trained professionals are able to work with you to find the exact cause of each of your issues and help you through exercises as well as regular chiropractic care so that you begin to feel like yourself again. These are just some of the services that we provide here at Balance Chiropractic Center, LLC. We love assisting others and helping them feel better again. No matter what your pain or injury is, we will work with you to ensure that you are pain free and feeling great.
