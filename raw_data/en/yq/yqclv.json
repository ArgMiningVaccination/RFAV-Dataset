Action Consists of IgG antibodies capable of providing passive immunity against CMV disease. Therapeutic effects Prevention of serious sequelae of CMV disease in transplant patients. Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Administered IV only, resulting in complete bioavailability. Distribution: Unknown. Metabolism and Excretion: Unknown. Use Cautiously in: Obstetric / Lactation: Pregnancy or lactation (safety not established); Renal insufficiency or predisposition to acute renal failure. Adverse Reactions/Side Effects Central nervous system - headache - tremor - anxiety - seizures Hematologic - pancytopenia - hemolysis - leukopenia Respiratory - wheezing - dyspnea - pulmonary edema Cardiovascular - hypotension - thromboembolism Gastrointestinal - nausea - vomiting - hepatic dysfunction Dermatologic - flushing - rash Genitourinary - oliguria - anuria - acute renal failure Musculoskeletal - back pain - muscle cramps Miscellaneous - allergic reactions including chills - fever - anaphylaxis (life-threatening) Interactions Drug-Drug interactionMay interfere with immune response live-virus vaccines including measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR ; do not administer within 3 mo of immune globulin). Route/DosageKidney Transplant Intravenous (Adults) 150 mg/kg within 72 hr of transplantation, followed by 100 mg/kg at 2, 4, 6, and 8 wk, then 50 mg/kg at 12 and 16 wk post-transplantation.Liver, Pancreas, Lung, or Heart Transplant Intravenous (Adults) 150 mg/kg within 72 hr of transplantation, and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 wk, then 100 mg/kg after at 12 and 16 wk post-transplantation. Intravenous (Children) Safety and efficacy has not been established in pediatrics, however adult doses have been used in children. Availability Powder for injection: 1000-mg vial, 2500-mg vial Nursing implications Nursing assessment - Monitor vital signs prior to, during, and following infusion and before any increases in infusion rate. - Monitor patient for adverse reactions throughout therapy. If patient develops minor side effects (nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, back pain, fever, flushing, chills), slow infusion rate or stop infusion temporarily. If hypotension or anaphylaxis occurs, stop infusion and administer treatment (epinephrine and diphenhydramine). Potential Nursing DiagnosesRisk for infection (Indications) Deficient knowledge, related to medication regimen (Patient/Family Teaching) Implementation Intravenous Administration - Intermittent Infusion: Reconstitute with 50 mL of sterile water for injection with a double-ended needle or large syringe. To avoid foaming, do not shake vial. If using a double-ended needle, insert into water first, as powder is supplied in an evacuated vial and water will transfer by suction. After sterile water is transferred, release residual vacuum to speed dissolution. Rotate gently to wet undissolved powder. Allow 30 min for powder to dissolve. Solution should be clear, colorless, and free of particulate matter. Infusion should be started within 6 hr and completed within 12 hr of reconstitution. - Administer via infusion pump through a separate IV line. If not possible, solution may be piggybacked in an IV line containing 0.9% NaCl, D5W, D10W, D20W, or combinations of dextrose but do not dilute to more than 1:2. Do not use filters. - Rate: Administer initial dose at 15 mg/kg/hr for first 30 min. If no adverse reactions occur, rate may be increased to 30 mg/kg/hr; if no adverse reactions occur in subsequent 30 min, rate may be increased to 60 mg/kg/hr. Do not exceed 75 mL/hr volume or 60 mg/kg/hr rate. Monitor patient closely during rate changes. May cause pain at injection site. - During subsequent doses, rate may be increased in same increments every 15 min if no adverse reactions occur, until 60 mg/kg/hr maximum is reached. Patient/Family Teaching - Instruct patient to notify health care professional if any adverse reactions occur. - If live virus vaccines were administered within 14 days of immune globulin, vaccination should be repeated 3 mo after the last dose of immune globulin. Evaluation/Desired Outcomes - Prevention of serious sequelae of CMV disease, including blindness, associated with transplantation of kidney, lung, liver, pancreas, or heart.
