Before treatment starts, a thorough consultation is needed so you and your Naturopathic Doctor can work together on an ideal treatment program to help you achieve your health goals. Here are some popular intravenous vitamin drips offered at Toronto Functional Medicine Centre's [IV therapy Toronto](https://torontofunctionalmedicine.com/services/nutritional-iv-therapy/) clinic to help you decide which kind you may need. Myers Cocktail Myers cocktail is one of the popular intravenous treatments offered in our wellness center and in other IV drip lounges. Here's an abstract from NCBI describing the origin of Myers IV: \"Building on the work of the late John Myers, MD, the author has used an intravenous vitamin-and-mineral formula for the treatment of a wide range of clinical conditions.\" Source: [NCBI] People with adrenal fatigue may benefit from a Myers cocktail. It may be an effective energy booster and may help keep your body in balance. High Dose Intravenous Vitamin C There is more to vitamin C than just being considered a \"vitamin\". High dose vitamin C has been shown to fight sepsis, a type of blood infection commonly seen in ICU patients. \"There's a doctor in Virginia who is trying to promote IV mega-dose vitamin C for intensive care units (ICU) by lecturing to ICU doctors throughout the nation. Dr. Paul Marik was the head of the Norfolk General Hospital's ICU. In January of 2016, out of desperation, he decided to try IV mega-dose vitamin C on a middle-aged woman dying from septic shock in his unit. His IV \"cocktail\" consisted of vitamin C, thiamine (vitamin B1), and hydrocortisone. Her turn-around and recovery were so unexpectedly rapid and complete that he continued using that cocktail for sepsis victims with a very high success rate.\" From: [HealthImpactNews.Com] If you're looking to get more information on high-dose IV vitamin C, [contact us here](https://torontofunctionalmedicine.com/contact-us/).
