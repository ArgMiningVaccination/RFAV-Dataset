Attention: Ms. Elisa Harkins 500 Arcola Road Collegeville, PA 19426 Dear Ms. Harkins : On February 4, 2020, pursuant to Section 564(b)(1)(C) of the Act, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determined that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the heal th and security of United States citizens living abroad, and that involves the virus that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID -19).1 On the basis of such determination, the Secretary of HHS on March 27, 2020, declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of drugs and biologic al products during the COVID -19 pandemic , pursuant to Section 564 of the Feder al Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act or the Act) (21 U.S.C. 360bbb -3), subject to terms of any authorization issued under that section.2 On December 11, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for emergency use of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine for the prevention of COVID -19 for individuals 16 years of age and older pursuant to Section 564 of the Act. FDA reissued the letter of authoriz ation twice: December 23, 20203 and February 25, 2021 .4 1 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Determination of a Public Health Emergency and Declaration that Circumstances Exist Justifying Authorizations Pursuant to Section 564(b) of the Federal F ood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb -3. February 4, 2020. 2 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Declaration that Circumstances Exist Justifying Authorizations Pursuan t to Section 564(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb -3, 85 FR 18250 (April 1, 2020). 3 In the December 23, 2020 revision, FDA remov ed reference to the number of doses per vial after dilution from the letter of authorization, clarified the instructions for vaccination provider s reporting to VAERS, and made other technical corrections. FDA also revised the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) to clarify the number of doses of vaccine per vial after dilution and the instructions for reporting to VAERS. In addition, the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) and the Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers were revised to include additional inf ormation on safety monitoring and to clarify information about the availability of other COVID -19 vaccines. 4 In the February 25, 2021 revision, FDA allowed flexibility on the date of submission of monthly periodic safety reports and revised the requirements for reporting of vaccine administration errors by Pfizer Inc. The Fact Sheet for Health Care Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) was revised to provide an update to the storage and transportation temperature for frozen vial s, direct the provider to the correct CDC website for information on monitoring vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse reactions, to include data from a developmental toxicity study, and add adverse reactions that have been identified d uring post authorization use. The Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers was revised to add adverse reactions that have been identified during post authorization use. Page 2 - Pfizer Inc. On May 10, 2021, having concluded that revising this EUA is appropriate to protect the public health or safety under section 564(g)(2) of the Act, FDA again is reissuing the letter in its entirety to authorize emergency use of Pfi zer-BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine for the prevention of COVID -19 for individuals 12 t hrough 15 years of age , as well as for individuals 16 years of age and older . With authorization of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine for the prevention of COVID -19 in individu als 12 through 15 years of age, the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) is being revised to include the following Warning: \"Syncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines , in particular in adolescents. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting.\" The Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers is being revised to instruct vaccine recipients or their caregivers to tell the vaccination provider about fainting in association with a previous injection. Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine is for use for active immunization to prevent COVID -19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) in individuals 12 years of age and older . The vaccine contains a nucleoside -modified messenger RNA (modRNA) encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS -CoV -2 formulated in lipid particles. It is an investigational vaccine not licensed for any indication . For the December 11, 2020 authorization for individuals 16 years of age and older, FDA reviewed safety and efficacy data from a n ongoing phase 1/2/3 trial in approximately 44,000 participants randomized 1:1 to receive Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 V accine or saline control . The trial has enrolled participants 12 years of age and older. FDA's review at that time considered the safety and effectiveness data as they relate to the request for emergenc y use authorization in individuals 16 years of age and older. FDA's review of the available safety data from 37,586 of the participants 16 years of age and older , who were followed for a median of two months after receiving the second dose , did not identify specific safety concerns that would preclude issuance of an EUA. FDA's analysis of the available efficacy data from 36, 523 participants 12 years of age and older without evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection prior to 7 days after dose 2 confirm ed the vaccine was 95% effective (95% credible interval 90.3, 97.6) in preventing COVID -19 occurring at least 7 days after the second dose (with 8 COVID -19 cases in the vaccine group compared to 162 COVID -19 cases in the placebo group). Based on these data , and review of manufacturing information regarding product quality and consistency, FDA concluded that it is reasonable to believe that Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine may be effective . Additionally, FDA determined it is reasonable to conclude , based on the totality of the scientific evidence a vailable, that the known and potential benefits of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine , for the prevention of COVID -19 in individuals 16 years of age and older . Finally, on December 10, 2020, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted in agreement with this conclusion. For the May 10, 2021 authorization for individuals 12 through 15 years of age, FDA reviewed safety and effectiveness data from the above -referenced, ongo ing Phase 1/2/3 trial that has enrolled approximately 46,000 participants, including 2,260 participants 12 through 15 years of age. Trial participants were randomized 1:1 to receive Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine or Page 3 - Pfizer Inc. saline control. FDA's review of the av ailable safety data from 2,260 participants 12 through 15 years of age, who were followed for a median of 2 months after receiving the second dose, did not identify specific safety concerns that would preclude issuance of an EUA. FDA's analysis of SARS -CoV -2 50% neutralizing antibody titers 1 month after the second dose of Pfizer - BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine in a subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection confirm the geometric mean antibody titer in participants 12 through 15 years of age was non -inferior to the geometric mean antibody titer in participants 16 through 25 years of age. FDA's analysis of available descriptive efficacy data from 1,983 participants 12 through 15 years of age without evidence o f SARS -CoV -2 infection prior to 7 days after dose 2 confirm that the vaccine was 100% effective (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0) in preventing COVID -19 occurring at least 7 days after the second dose (with no COVID -19 cases in the vaccine group compar ed to 16 COVID -19 cases in the placebo group). Based on these data, FDA concluded that it is reasonable to believe that Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine may be effective in individuals 12 through 15 years of age. Additionally, FDA determined it is reasonab le to conclude, based on the totality of the scientific evidence available, that the known and potential benefits of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine, for the prevention of COVID -19 in individuals 12 th rough 15 years of age. Having concluded that the criteria for issuance of this authorization under Section 564(c) of the Act are met, I am authorizing the emergency use of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine for the prevention of COVID -19, as described in the Scope of Authorization section of this letter (Section II) and subject to the terms of this authorization. I. Criteria for Issuance of Authorization I have concluded that the emergency use of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Va ccine for the prevention of COVID -19 when administered as described in the Scope of Authorization ( Section II) meet s the criteria for issuance of an authorization under Section 564(c) of the Act, because: 1. SARS -CoV -2 can cause a serious or life -threatening disease or condition, including severe respiratory illness, to humans infected by this virus; 2. Based on the totality of scientific evidence available to FDA, it is reasonable to believe that Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID -19, and that, when used under the conditions described in this authorization, the known and potential benefits of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine when used to prevent COVID -19 outweigh its known and potential risks; and 3. There is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the emergency use of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine to prevent COVID -19.5 II. Scope of Authorization 5 No other criteria of issuance have been prescribed by regulation under Section 564(c )(4) of the Act. Page 4 - Pfizer Inc. I have concluded, pursuant to Section 564(d)(1) of the Act, that the scope of this authorization is limited as follows: Pfizer Inc. will supply Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine either directly or through authorized distributor (s)6, to emergency response stakeholders7 as directed by the U.S. government, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) and/or other designee , for use consistent with the terms and conditions of this EUA ; The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine covered by this authorization will be administered by vaccination providers8 and used only to prevent COVID -19 in individuals ages 12 and older; and Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine may be administered by a vaccination provider without an individual prescription for each vaccine recipient . Product Description The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine is supplied as a frozen susp ension in multiple dose vials ; each vial must be diluted with 1.8 mL of sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP prior to use to form the vaccine. The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine does not contain a preservative . Each 0.3 mL dose of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine contains 30 mcg of a nucleoside - modified messenger RNA (modRNA) encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS -CoV -2. 6 \"Authorized Distributor(s)\" are identified by Pfizer Inc. or, if applicable, by a U.S. government entity, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and/or other designee, as an entity or entities allowed to distribute authorized Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine. 7 For purposes of this letter, \"emergency response stakeholder\" refers to a public health agency and its delegates that have legal responsibility and authority for responding to an incident, based on political o r geographical boundary lines (e.g., city, county, tribal, territorial, State, or Federal), or functional (e.g., law enforcement or public health range) or sphere of authority to administer, deliver, or distribute vaccine in an emergency situation. In some cases (e.g., depending on a state or local jurisdiction's COVID -19 vaccination response organization and plans), there might be overlapping roles and responsibilities among \"emergency response stakeholders\" and \"vaccination providers\" (e.g., if a local he alth department is administering COVID -19 vaccines; if a pharmacy is acting in an official capacity under the authority of the state health department to administer COVID -19 vaccines). In such cases, it is expected that the conditions of authorization that apply to emergency response stakeholders and vaccination providers will all be met. 8 For purposes of this letter, \"vaccination provider\" refers to the facility, organization , or healthcare provider licensed or otherwise authorized by the emergency respon se stakeholder (e.g., non -physician healthcare professionals, such as nurses and pharmacists pursuant to state law under a standing order issued by the state health officer) to administer or provide vaccination services in accordance with the applicable em ergency response stakeholder's official COVID -19 vaccination and emergency response plan(s) and who is enrolled in the CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program. For purposes of this letter, \"healthcare provider\" also refers to a person authorized by the U.S. Depar tment of Health and Human Services (e.g., under the PREP Act Declaration for Medical Countermeasures against COVID -19) to administer FDA -authorized COVID -19 vaccine (e.g., qualified pharmacy technicians and State -authorized pharmacy interns acting under th e supervision of a qualified pharmacist) . See, e.g., HHS. Fourth Amendment to the Declaration Under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for Medical Countermeasures Against COVID -19 and Republication of the Declaration . 85 FR 79190 (Decembe r 9, 2020). Page 5 - Pfizer Inc. Each dose of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine also includes the following ingredients: lipids 0.01 potassiu m chloride, 0.01 mg monobasic potassium phosphate, 0.36 mg sodium chloride, 0.07 mg dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, and 6 mg sucrose. The diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection) contributes an additional 2.16 mg sodium chloride per dose. The dosing regimen is two doses of 0.3 mL each , 3 weeks apart. The manufacture of the authorized Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine is limited to those facilities identified and agreed upon in Pfizer's request for authorization. The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine vial label and carton labels are clearly marked for \"Emergency Use Authorization.\" The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine is authorized to be distributed , stored , further redistributed , and admin istered by emergency response stakeholders when packaged in the authorized manufacturer packaging ( i.e., vials and carton s), despite the fact that the vial and carton labels may not contain information that otherwise would be required under the FD&C Act . Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine is authorized for emergency use with the following product -specific information required to be made available to vaccination providers and recipients , respectively (referred to as \"authorized labeling\") : Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) : Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine to Prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers: Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine to Prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) in Individuals 12 Years of Age and Older I have concluded , pursuant to Section 564(d)(2) of the Act, that it is reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine , when used to prevent COVID -19 and used in accordance with this Scope of Authorization (Section II), outweigh its known and potential risks. I have concluded, pursuant to Section 564(d)(3) of the Act, based on the totality of scientific evidence available to FDA, that it is reasonable to believe that Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine may be effective in preventin g COVID -19 when used in accordance with this Scope of Authorization (Section II), pursuant to Section 564(c)(2)(A) of the Act. Having reviewed the scientific information available to FDA, including the information supporting the conclusions described in Section I above, I have concluded that Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine (as described in this Scope of Authorization (Section II)) meets the criteria set forth in Section 564(c) of the Act concerning safety and potential effectiveness. Page 6 - Pfizer Inc. The emergency use of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine under this EUA must be consistent with, and may not exceed, the terms of the Authorization, including the Scope of Authorization (Section II) and the Cond itions of Authorization (Section I II).
