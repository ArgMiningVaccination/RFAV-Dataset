These discursive writings were gathered and systematized in about AD600 by Vgbhaa, to produce the Agahdayasahit ('Heart of Medicine Compendium') that became the most popular and widely used textbook of ayurvedic medicine in history. Vgbhaa's work was translated into many other languages and became influential throughout Asia. Ayurvedic medicine has remained a living system of medical interpretation and therapy in South Asia until today, and is formally supported by the ministries of health in India and Sri Lanka. Throughout the twentieth century it has also had adherents in East and South Africa. In recent decades ayurveda has started to become popular in Europe and North America where it has a taken its place in the portfolio of therapies called Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). This modernized form of ayurveda, sometimes called 'New Age Ayurveda' is an adapted and edited form of the tradition. It has been re-imported to India where it is marketed in branded forms to the middle classes in urban centres. Simultaneously, modernized ayurvedic services to the tourist industry, especially in Kerala, have become economically and socially important. Chinese culture Traditional Chinese medicine has more than 5,000 years of history as a system of medicine that is based on a philosophical concept of balance ( yin and yang, Qi, History of alternative medicine in Western culture Western approaches to alternative medicine have more than 3,000 years of history behind them as systems of medicine based on natural philosophies that are rooted in all aspects of Western culture. This is a history of how Western natural philosophies developed over the ages. European History Throughout Western European history there were two major trends: the professionalism of physicians who belonged to the upper classes and the folk healers who lived among the peasant population. The professionals developed in order to enhance their status in life, while the folk healers developed out of the necessity to survive. Herbalism and the water cure, The Greco-Roman Period In Europe, interest in the hydrotherapy can be traced back to the ancient Roman spas and the hot mineral springs at Bath, England . The Dark Ages In Europe, the Catholic church played a central role. At first, the Church suppressed all development. Later on, the Church supported the development of professional physicians. Eventually, the power of the Church literally exterminated much of the competition from folk healers during the witch-hunting period which spanned more than four centuries (from the 14th to the 17th century). Healers throughout the medieval period could come in many varieties. Physicians who studied the works of the Greek masters at universities, were the elite of the medical profession in the Middle Ages. However few people other than the well-off or the nobility had regular access to these. Folk healers passed on their knowledge from master to apprentice, and were more accessible to the peasant or labourer than physicians. Unregulated, but knowledgeable on herbs and folk-remedies, they were gradually excluded from the medical system. Monastic medicine monasteries played a big part in the provision of medieval medicine. Virtually every monastery had an infirmary for the monks or nuns, and this led to provision being made for the care of secular patients. 19th century A medical reform movement was started in Europe as a reaction against heroic medicine. Germany became the world center of medical research, training, and pharmaceuticals drawing students from all over the world by the end of the 19th century. Hygiene and public health became the central focus of emerging urbanization. The 20th century In the first half of the 20th century a number of factors including internal conflict and the relative success of conventional medicine led to the decline of alternative medicine in the western world. American History Western healing practices developed differently in the New World than they did in the Old World. In Europe, physicians already had a centuries old monopoly over the right to treat patients. But in America, medical practice was literally open to anyone who called themselves a doctor. The Popular Health Movement (1830-1850) In America, the Popular Health Movement played a central role in the development of alternative therapy practices. Herbalism, Only homeopathy, natural hygiene and eclecticism managed to last from the 1830s through the rest of the 19th century. Progressive era of Health Care Reform (1890-1920) The 20th century The high-technology of medicine becomes firmly housed in the hospital. Hospitals are transformed from institutions designed for long-term care of the sick into facilities designed to test, treat and release patients as fast as possible.
