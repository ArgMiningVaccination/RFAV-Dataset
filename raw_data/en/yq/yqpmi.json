Methods: A total of 58 patients were randomized into a high-dose acupuncture group (19 cases, 5 cases dropped off), a low-dose acupuncture group (20 cases, 6 cases dropped off) and a control group (19 cases, 2 cases dropped off). Conventional chemotherapy and antiemetic treatment were adopted in the control group. On the basis of the treatment in the control group, acupuncture was applied 7 times each chemotherapy cycle for totally 21 times in the high-dose acupuncture group, and 3 times each chemotherapy cycle for totally 9 times in the low-dose acupuncture group. Baihui (GV 20), Zusanli (ST 36), Neiguan (PC 6), etc. were selected in the two acupuncture groups, as well as back-shu points selected by the meridian heat sensing technique. Electroacupuncture was connected to ipsilateral Zusanli (ST 36) and Neiguan (PC 6), with continuous wave, 2 Hz in frequency for 20 min. The Edmonton symptom assessment system (ESAS) score was observed on day 1-7, 14, and 21 of each cycle of chemotherapy respectively in the 3 groups. Results: The symptom burden was worst within 7 days of each cycle of chemotherapy in the 3 groups. After the 3rd chemotherapy cycle, the total score of ESAS in the low-dose acupuncture group was lower than the control group (P<0.05), the total score and the scores of feeling of non-well being, pain and shortness of breath of ESAS in the acupuncture group (the high-dose acupuncture group combined with the low-dose acupuncture group) were lower than the control group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Acupuncture shows promising effect in controlling symptom burden during adjuvant chemotherapy in gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy. 58195206192721 392 controlled trial (RCT); symptom burden.
