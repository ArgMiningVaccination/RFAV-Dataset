I'm going to discuss lessons learned, what has changed, and remaining huge challenges. Unfortunately, after the pandemic, our position in 2022 reminds me even more than ever of Aragorn at the Black Gate of Mordor, but that does not mean things are hopeless.

How would that work? What are the obstacles? Is it even possible? It should be, but it will be messy and complicated.

It's basically the same as the last strategic plan, but with one new addition. It's not really a new addition, but it signals a resurrection of an old trope about \"integrating\" quackery with science-based 2021 [](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/evenity-for-osteoporosis/) [Evenity for Osteoporosis](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/evenity-for-osteoporosis/) Hip and wrist fractures are a common result of osteoporosis. A new drug, Evenity, reduces the risk of vertebral fractures, but it doesn't significantly reduce the risk of non-vertebral fractures. Other drugs do.

A recent review discovers plenty of pseudoscience. [Jann Bellamy](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/author/versus/)/ February 27, 2020 "}
