WIPO attempts to collaborate for each report with institutional partners (IGOs, NGOs, public institutions of Member States) working in the respective field and having an interest in a specific topic. The collaborative work in the planning and evaluation phases may also serve as a vehicle for these institutions to familiar - ize themselves with the utilization and exploitation of patent information and related issues of patent protection. WIPO welcomes proposals for collaboration. Each report also serves as an illustrative example for retrieving patent information in the respective field and how search strategies may be tailored accordingly. It therefore includes detailed explanations of the particular search methodology, the databases used and well documented search queries that should ideally enable the reader to conduct a similar search.Each report of this project is contracted out to an external firm selected in a tendering procedure. The tender is open to a limited number of bidders that were pre-selected based on their submission of an Expression of Interest (EOI). WIPO invites the submis - sion of further EOIs by qualified providers.

patent applications were extracted from the Patbase (Minesoft) and the FamPat and USPTO or other databases provided by national patent offices. Patbase and FamPat group together patent applications into families of patents and cover all of the domains found in the documents published by 95 patent offices. Patbase and FamPat group respectively patent applications into INPADOC families and Fampat families (definition can be found in appendix \"Terminology\"). The research methodology used for this study combines conventional Boolean operators (AND, OR and AND NOT) with more complex search operators such as word truncations (in the middle or at the end of the word), search of successions of words and search for several words in the same sentence or paragraph. Keyword searches may be carried out in the titles, abstract and claims of documents. The patent search were limited or extended by the use of codes of the International Patent Classification (IPC), the European classification (ECLA), the US patent classification (USPC) or the Japan FileIndex (Japan FI). The patent searches were not limited by filing or priority dates. Sets of data were validated and/or corrected by intellectual screening of the retrieved documents. The processing of raw data and overall statistics was performed using Intellixir software (www.intellixir.com ). Vaccines for selected infectious diseases 2012 11 Guide to reading diagrams: CATEGORIES OF THE BREAKDOWN (e.g. Patent Offices) APPLICANTSNumber of patent families filed by different applicants via the European procedure Number of patent families filed by GSK in the different patent offices Vaccines for selected infectious diseases 2012 12 Executive summary This patent landscape deals with active constituents of prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases. It focuses specifically on three diseases: human pneumoccal conjugate vaccines, human conjugate typhoid vaccines and human influenza vaccines. It also focuses on patent filings in Brazil, India and China. A vaccine is defined by the World Health Organization as any preparation intended to produce immunity to a disease by stimulating the production of antibodies. Vaccines include, for example, suspensions of killed or attenuated microorganisms, or products or derivatives of microorganisms. Vaccines are of public health importance since they prevent from major pandemics but not all. Therefore, the development of new vaccines is still required to combat diseases such as HIV or malaria, for exemple, but also to improve existing ones due to the emergence of new strains of pathogens such as for influenza. After an explanation of the followed search methodology to retrieve relevant patent families, this report starts by the overall analysis of the datasets of patent families claiming active constituents of prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases. This overall analysis led to the identification of more than 11800 patent families filed between 1921 and 2011 with an average of about 50% of these families including, at least, one grant of a patent in one jurisdiction and 60% including a PCT application. Historically, the United Kingdom and the United States have been the major patenting locations. Today, the United States are largerly dominating the area but is nevertheless challenged by China in the recent decade. Japan, Russia and European regional and national offices have been also active places of filings. The offices of second filings are mainly regional and national European offices as well as the United States. The most common applicants were identified as the US Government laboratories and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). They are followed by Russian research institutes, other large pharmaceutical companies (e.g. Pfizer, Novartis) and other important research institutes specialized in infectious diseases (e.g. Pasteur Institute). A deeper analysis of Brazilian, Indian, and Chinese filings shows a continuous increase of first filings in those three countries. However, Brazilian and Indian patent applications are still modest (about 70 patent families on the period). Indian data must however be taken with caution given the fact that patent information in this area is not yet fully available in worldwide database. Among these three countries, China is playing ahead in terms of filings. The record of Chinese patent application started in 1985, continuously increased since, to reach more than 180 first filings in 2010. A focus on Chinese first filings shows that these patenting activity is mainly due to Chinese academies of sciences and Chinese Universities. Hardly any Chinese industrial applicants are among the most active players. The global patent landscape on active constituents of prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases deals with a very large volume of patent families. It is important to keep in mind that many different types of inventions are in the dataset, leading sometimes to deal with apples and oranges. Information can only be relevant at a macrolevel. In order to be able to draw more accurate focuses of technological sectors, it is convenient to analyse smaller volumes of patent families and therefore to focus on more specific fields. Vaccines for selected infectious diseases 2012 13 This was the purpose of the three other patent landscapes that each focused only on one type of vaccines. The first one focused on patent families claiming active ingredients of human pneumoccal conjugate vaccines. The dataset includes 165 patent families, the first one being filed in 1979. About 40% of these families included, at least, one grant of a patent in one jurisdiction and 70%, a PCT application. The United States and the United Kingdom have been the major patenting locations. China, with a recent but active patenting activity, is the third office of first filing in terms of number of patent applications. This field is mainly dominated by pharmaceutical companies and especially by large pharmaceutical corporations such as GSK, Novartis and Pfizer that tend to protect their inventions with a wide geographical coverage. The presence of some complex patent families, enlarging the protection of initial inventions, highlights an important patenting strategy developed by these companies to dominate this market. It is also interesting to note the recent active patenting activity of Novartis as well as the fact that contrary to GSK and Pfizer, this pharmaceutical corporation is not yet marketing pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. The second one focused on patent families claiming active ingredients of human typhoid conjugate vaccines. The dataset includes 36 patent families filed between 1981 and October 2011. This low volume of filings is also marked by a low volume of granted patents since only 30% of them were issued by, at least, one patent office. The United States and the United Kingdom dominate as offices of first filing but India, despite a late arrival, comes third. Vaccines on the market were developed by a US government laboratory, the national institute of health (NIH) that may explain the dominant position of this player on this field. The typhoid sector is, here, well balanced between industrial and institutional applicants. The emergence of India is due to the very active research of Indian institutes to develop new conjugate typhoid vaccines for infants and especially the ALL India Institute. The third and last focused on patent families claiming active ingredients of human influenza vaccines. The dataset includes 516 patent families filed between 1941 and October 2011. Half of them have a PCT member. The rate of granted patents was not very high, reaching barely 40%. The patenting activity is very high in the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and Japan. The first efficient vaccine was developed in 1944 with the help of the American army which started an intense research in this field inside the US government laboratories. This analysis confirms the dominant position of the US even if Russian institutes and large pharmaceutical corporations such as Novartis and GSK are coming first. Of important economical importance, this sector led to the arrival of new players and to large geographical protections of inventions especially for those filed by players of the pharmaceutical industry. To draw an even more detailed picture of these three focused field and, it would require integrating information from the patent landscape with market and pipeline data as well as an analysis of a technological breakdown of these datasets. This would enable a better understanding of companies' strategy and a more precise picture of the content of the patent portfolio of each player. Vaccines for selected infectious diseases 2012 14 Introduction The present patent landscape report is based on WIPO's Development Agenda project DA_19_30_31_01 (\"Developing Tools for Access to Patent Information\") described in document CDIP/4/6 adopted by the CDIP at its fourth session held from November 16 to November 20, 2009. In the context of this approved project WIPO is preparing 12 patent landscape reports in the biennium 20102011. Patent landscape reports are envisaged to become in future a standard service of WIPO in the context of improved access to and exploitation of patent information. The present landscape report was prepared in collaboration with WIPO and the WHO cluster on Innovation, Information, Evidence and Research (IER). It is intended to contribute to the implementation of several of the eight elements of the Global Strategy and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property (GSPOA) of WHO. The intention of this patent landscape report on vaccine related patents is to detect patterns of patenting activity and innovation in the area of vaccine research and manufacturing in order to facilitate the sourcing of vaccine technologies that could potentially be used in developing countries, via a comprehensive study of the patents and patent applications filed in this field. A first part (part I) will cover vaccines against infectious human and animal diseases in general. This part aims at providing an overview of patenting activity in the area of vaccines by means of a statistical analysis. A second part (part II) will complement this broad picture by focusing separately on the patenting related to vaccines for three selected human infectious diseases of high economic and health burden importance: streptococcus pneumonia conjugate vaccines; typhoid conjugate vaccines; and influenza vaccines. In addition to describing the respective statistical patterns of patenting activity, this Part II of the report also aims at identifying all of the relevant patent families, and is complemented by respective databases including these patent families. Each part of the report also includes a special focus on the patenting activity in Brazil, China and India. The scope of the present patent landscape report aims are patent families that claim inventions directly related to vaccines, i.e. any patents that protect any aspect like the active ingredient (antigen, antibody) as such, derivatives thereof, combinations, methods of production, uses, etc. Vaccines for selected infectious diseases 2012 15 1. Active ingredients of vaccines against infectious diseases 1.1. Search methodology 1.1.1. Introduction This section describes the search methodology developed to retrieve patents and patent applications claiming active constituents of vaccines against human and animal infectious diseases. The narrative of this search history shows how the search was performed. It describes specific tools, databases, and challenges encountered and methods of circumventing. This section also discusses the limits of the use of patent classification codes (IPC, ECLA...) when looking for patents and patent applications dealing with active constituents of vaccines. As the volume of patents and patent applications expected in the issued patent database is very large, it cannot be considered to be exhaustive and without noise. It is estimated to have 5 to 10 % of missing relevant patent families and 5 to 10% of irrelevant patent families which is the limit that does not affect the global trends, analysis and perspective of this part of the report that aims only at describing the general statistical patterns of patenting activity in this area. 1.1.2. Methodology and databases A background study was first performed by looking at the literature on vaccines against infectious diseases in order to collect keywords to build the patent queries and especially to help us determine the relevancy of a patent family compared to another in relation to the fact that only patent describing \"active constituents\" had to be taken into account. General articles about vaccines against infectious diseases found on the Internet were useful to make a list of keywords1. Then, a review of patent classification was carried out to identify patent classification codes related to vaccines against infectious diseases. With the list of keywords and patent classification codes established such as described, queries were built and run into Patbase database (MinesoftTM). 1 http://www.who.int/to pics/vaccines/en/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine see appendix 2 Vaccines for selected infectious diseases 2012 16 1.1.3. Background study Review of the literature A vaccine is a preparation of killed or inactivated microbes (parasites, viruses, batteria) or purified products derived from them used to elicit the immune system to a particular disease. Prophylactic vaccines used to elicit the immune system to prevent future infections have to be distinguished from therapeutic vaccines that are used to treat a disease already present in the organism (such as cancers). Different types of vaccines are produced or under development such as killed vaccines, attenuated vaccines, subunit vaccines, conjugate vaccines, toxoid vaccines, DNA vaccines, recombinant vectors or synthetic vaccines. This analysis focuses on patents and patent applications claiming active constituents of prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases. Following this definition, we excluded from this study patents and patent applications claiming purely diagnostic related technologies, therapeutic vaccines, general methods for large scale production of vaccines, as well as documents claiming only methods of administration of vaccines or vaccine adjuvants (however, if adjuvants or methods of administration were claimed in a patent were the active ingredients of vaccine is clearly described, these documents were included into the database). From the background study, a list of keywords was established. This list was refined during the building of the search strategy by reading and analysing relevant patents and patent applications as well as patents and patent applications that were initially found by broader queries bu determined as unrelevant. The potential translations (vaccine> vaccina), orthographic variations (immunise >immunize) and similar words (prevent>prevention) used in the refined queries are not mentioned in the lists below. These lists are thereby not considered as exhaustive. Keywords potentially related to relevant patents and patent applications: Vaccine: constituent: SEQ ID (peptide sequence) Prevention of a disease and induction of the immune system: prevent, protect, elicit, generate, induce, trigger Infectious diseases: infection, virus, bacteria, parasite, VLP (virus like particle) Other: subject, host, patient, man, human, woman, animal Keywords potentially related to irrelevant patents and patent applications: Technologies related to vaccines but not active constituent: adjuvant, probiotic, stabilizer Vaccines for selected infectious diseases 2012 17 Non infectious diseases: cancer, tumor, carcinoma, neoplasm, melanoma, cytokine, Crohn, Alzheimer, immune disease, autoimmune, inflammation, neurotoxicity, amyloid, arthritis, allergy, sclerosis, leukemia, lymphoma, diabetes, obesity, healing Production of vaccines: cell line, culture, matrix, model, bioreactor, reactor, large scale, mass production, manufacture Treatment and test: assay, diagnosis, detect, immunopotentiation, immunomodulation, immunostimulation, treatment, therapy, medicament, medicine, compound, monoclonal, graft, rejection, down regulation, xenograft, implant, transplantation, immunosuppressor Delivering and formulation: deliver, cream, tablet, aqueous, solvent, gel, powder, oil, water, emulsion, dry Review of relevant classification codes By screening the international, European, American and Japanese patent classifications, there is no specific code for vaccines but a set of codes related to active constituent of vaccines such as antigens. However these codes are not specific to infectious diseases but also include antigens against other diseases. The codes corresponding to medicinal preparations containing antigens directed against infectious diseases were collected. The following codes were thereby identified: International Patent Classification (IPC): Selection of subgroups of subclass A61K39 corresponding to medicinal preparations containing antigens or antibodies directed against infectious diseases Examples of selected subgroups of antigens, bound to carriers) The reason for not selecting certain IPC codes was they were not specific to infectious diseases. Although these codes were not included in the query, they can be present in the relevant and validated patents and patent applications of the final database. US Patent Classification (USPC): Selection of subgroups of subclass 424/184.1 corresponding to antigen, epitope, or other immunospecific immunoeffector specific to infectious diseases Examples of selected subgroups of subclass 424/184.1: 424/193.1 (Conjugate or complex), 424/204.1 (Virus or component thereof), 424/254.1 (Bordetella pertussis) Examples of unselected subgroups of subclass 424/184.1: 424/274.1 (Fungus, except allergen, or component thereof or substance produced by said fungus (e.g., Trichophyton, etc.)), 424/277.1 (Cancer cell or component thereof) Vaccines for selected infectious diseases 2012 18 Subclasses 424/813 to 424/832 corresponding to viral vaccines or bacterial vaccines for some animal species such as bovine or fish species Examples of subclasses 424/813 to 424/832: 424/817 (Viral vaccine for fish), 424/825 (Bacterial vaccine for porcine species (e.g., swine, etc.)) European classification (ECLA): Selection of subclasses of subgroup A61K39 corresponding to medicinal preparations containing antigens or antibodies directed against infectious diseases Examples of selected subclasses of Selection of subclasses of subgroup A61K39 corresponding to medicinal preparations containing antigens or antibodies directed against infectious diseases Examples of selected subclasses of subgroup A61K39: A61K39/002 or variola virus A61K of viral and bacterial of of subgroup the immunostimulating additives, e.g. chemical adjuvants) 1.1.4. Search strategy The patent search (see the corresponding appendix for the detailed strategy) started by building a pool of patents and patent applications retrieved by the classification codes selected (pool 1 - queries 1 to 5). In a second step, within this pool 1, patent searches using a combination of keywords specific to vaccines were carried out to select patents and patent applications that clearly dealt with vaccines. The group of these selected patents from pool 1 (i.e. patent dealing with vaccines) is now called pool 2 (queries 6 to 7 - see figure 1). At this point of the search strategy, pool 2 was split into two subgroups (pool 2A and pool 2B). Pool 2A was obtained by crossing pool 2 with queries built from high relevant keywords (e.g. vaccine, queries 8 to 19). Pool 2B is constituted with the remaining documents (pool 2 minus pool 2A - query 37). At this point, pool 2A and pool 2B contained respectively about 80% and 20% of relevant patents. Pool 2A was then cleaned using queries built with keywords related to irrelevant patents (see lists above in section 1.1.3 and queries 20 to 36). A first group of relevant and validated patents and patent applications was thereby obtained. Vaccines for selected infectious diseases 2012 19 Figure 1 - Schematic view of the patent search strategy followed for this study For Pool 2B, another approach was implemented consisting in an iteration of keyword search queries that either selected relevant documents or eliminated irrelevant ones, decreasing progressively the number of documents remaining in pool 2B (queries 38 to 48). A second group of relevant and validated patents and patent applications was thereby obtained. Relevant patents from pool 2A and pool2B were gathered to constitute the final database. Finally, to validate the fact that only a tiny fraction of relevant patents and patent applications were not covered by the selected classification codes (pool 1), other classification codes were investigated (queries 49 to 51). 1.2. Statistical analysis 1.2.1. General statistics of filings The patent search resulted in 11818 INPADOC families of patents and patent applications published until November 2011. These 11818 patent families include 51476 patents or published applications. Among these 11818 patent families, 5950 included one or more granted patents. Granted patents were identified by creating a query based on kind codes related to granted patents of all patenting authorities and applying it to the patent pool of active ingredients of human pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Each patenting office has its own kind code system. For example, publications of the European Patent Office having a \"B\" kind code are granted patents, whereas publications having an \"A1, A2, A3\" kind code are applications. For the US Patent and Trademark Office, publications with an \"A\" kind code published before November 2000 and publications with kind code \"B1, B2\" are granted patent while publications with a \"A1, A2\" kind code published after November 2000 are applications. Families having granted family members do not necessarily mean that protection has entered into force or the patent is still valid. Granted patents may not be in force for several reasons including that the patent term expired, that fees have not been paid, or that it did not survive opposition or revocation procedures.

The graph represents the number of patent families (Y axis) over the year of first filing (X axis). This year (priority year) was chosen rather than the publication year, as this is more indicative of patenting activities since they are less dependent on the varying publication policies and docket backlogs of patent offices. Please note that for earlier years of filing, national publication policies and the evolution of national patent legislation have to be taken into account. For example, until November 2000, the US patent legislation published only granted US patents. Thereby, US applications that were not granted were in fact never published. For the coverage of national databases used in this study, please refer to corresponding appendix. In addition, because of the 18 months of publication delay after the date of patent filing, the data after 2009 are incomplete. Figure 2 - Evolution of patent filings per year of first filing and comparison to global patenting activity per year of first filing Vaccines for selected infectious diseases 2012 21 The graph shows a strong increase of filings from 1980 (50 filings) to 2000 (500 filings) reaching a plateau of 500600 filings a year in the 20002010 period. When comparing to global activities in patent filings (figure 1, dashed gray line) from 1985 to 2008, it can be seen that patent activities related to vaccines has more or less (less before 1995 and more after 1995) followed the trend of global increase in patenting. The next figure further describes patent activity over time similar to Figure 2 but in more detail. The count of families for each year of first filing is split into two fractions according to whether families included a PCT application or not. Starting 1991, PCT applications were widely used to reach over 60% of patent families. Figure 3 - Evolution of the number of patent families with an d without PCT applications per year of first filing The table below lists the office of origin of all PCT applications. This table was established by looking at the application number of a PCT filing that mentions the office of origin of the PCT (e.g. 2008WO FR00687, this PCT application was filed via the French patent office). This table shows that PCT applications were mainly filed via national or regional offices. Only few applications (5%) were filed directly via the international bureau.

The count of families for each year of first filing is split into two fractions according to whether families included at least one granted patent or not. In the 1990s, up to 70% of patent families contained at least one granted patent while, after 2000, this rate has been continuously decreasing from 50% to barely 10% in 2009. The small fraction of grants in younger families (since 2005) reflects the pendency of patent issue, i.e. the time between the filing of an application and the grant of a patent which varies from a patent office to another and can last for several years (e.g. about 4 years for patents issued by EPO). For these families the examination of family members may still be pending or may not be requested yet. For earlier years of filing, national publication policies and the evolution of national patent legislation have to be taken into account. For example, until November 2000, the US patent office only published granted US patents. Thereby, US applications that were not granted were in fact never published. For the coverage of national databases used in this study, please refer to corresponding appendix. In addition, because of the 18 months of publication delay after the date of patent filing, the data after 2009 are incomplete.

Location of first filings An analysis of the place of filing of priority patents results in the following tables. The location of first filings gives an indication of the country of origin of applicants and the dynamic of innovation in these countries. A map compiling these data can be found in the corresponding appendix. Please note that 319 patent filings were not classified in the list below because of a lack of priority data in the database. It mainly concerns patent applications registered in Thailand and Taiwan as well as about 50 old patent applications registered in the UK, that seem to correspond to extensions not properly grouped within the patent family. As it concerns less than 2% of the dataset, it was unnecessary to perform manual corrections to improve statistics.

Evolution of first filings by offices (2/2) Vaccines for selected diseases 27 27 Among the offices of first filings that gather the highest number of patent and patent applications, several countries have a long history and strong continuous filings all over the period such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Russia, France, Australia, Korea and Germany, and largely dominate as offices of first filing. On the contrary, China, that registered the second more important volume of filings over the period, has had an emerging filing activity over the last decade. The filings stemming from Brazil, Cuba, Argentina, Taiwan, India and South Africa, although not yet massive, are still worth noticing. In order to have a better understanding of the country of origin and the innovation dynamic in these countries, it is more appropriate to take a look at the number of filings according to inventors' place of residence rather than the office of first filing. To be able to make these statistics, the data related to Inventor's country (extracted from the address of the inventor), indexed in FamPat database (QuestelTM), was used. To do this, patent families of the database \"Active Ingredients of Vaccines\" were loaded into FamPat. The number of relevant patent families changes (12323 instead of 11818) because of the different definition of FAMPAT families compared to INPADOC families (FAMPAT families are built with patent applications having exactly the same priority whereas INPADOC families are built with patent applications having at least one priority patent application in common). The number of filings naming at least one inventor coming from a country in particular was then counted. It should be noted that totals of the two categories of the table are different because the inventors indicated in an individual patent application may have different countries of residence; each country was counted once, e.g. an application with two inventors residing in Belgium and one inventor residing in the United Kingdom would result in one count for each country. In addition, these data should be taken with caution, since the country of inventors are not always stated in the databases (this is particularly true for Japanese and Chinese filings as well as ancient patents that do not systematically state this data). The number of inventors stemming from these two countries are therefore underestimated. Based on these data, it was noted that Canadian innovation tends to be first protected through the US patent office and that European innovation tends to be first protected through UK patent offices and through European Procedure. Several reasons can coexist to explain these differences: The interest in specific cases to use US provisional patents (even when the innovation do not stems from US inventors) The difference in location of patent officers and research team. For example, 414 applications filed by Belgian inventors vs. 13 first filings registered at the Belgian patent office. This is explained by the fact that GSK vaccine research team is located in Belgium but files in the United Kingdom where are located the headquarters. On the same way, NOVARTIS/CHIRON research team is located in Italy but files in the United Kingdom. The interest of filing directly in English to lessen future translation fees Some inventors are collaborating with foreign research teams and therefore do not file in their country of origin but in the country of their collaborators. This is for instance the case for Singaporeans that collaborate with many US companies, institutes or Universities.

Location of second filings An analysis of the location of second filings results in the following table. A map compiling these data can be found in the corresponding appendix. Countries chosen for the extension of priority filings are an indicator of the markets and/or the production sites. The choice of countries may also be guided by company's competitors and potential infringers, even if there is no market in these corresponding territories. In Life Sciences, the choice can also be guided by usual locations of clinical trials (Poland, Hungary, Thailand, India...). These data were established by looking at the publication numbers of each family without taking into account the publication number of the first filing. However, for patent and patent applications of European countries filed via the European Procedure, a different counting was carried out because of specificities of European procedures. According to the designated and chosen offices, a new patent application number is attributed by these offices or not. For instance, German patent office will deliver a number (DE123456) after an extension via the European procedure while France will use the EP number (EP654321). When looking at the patent families via the patent & patent application numbers, it therefore created, improperly, a higher number of German extensions compared to French ones. Consequently, when a patent family contained a patent application filed via the EPO, the numbers issued by the selected offices (during the national phases) were not recorded. These numbers were counted only if no EP filing was part of the family. Many second filings were performed via the PCT procedure (as seen in the previous section, it represented about 60% of the patent applications). The European Patent office (EPO), Australia, Canada, Japan and the United States also dominate as offices of second filings. Beware that the importance of Australia must be understood in relation to the policy of the Australian patent office which automatically delivered an Australian patent number when the PCT mentions Australia even if no extension was filed in Australia during the national phase.

Figure 6 - List of main applicants ( 50 patent or patent applications) The US Government laboratories and Russian Scientific Research Institutes dominate in terms of number of patent families. GSK, Novartis, Pfizer, Merck&Co and SanofiAventis have a strong global position. It should be noted that this position may be explained by the mergers and acquisition strategy of these large pharmaceutical companies. To do these statistics, affiliates and subsidiaries were gathered under their parent company except in some cases. For example, Merial and Sanofi Aventis were not grouped together because of the separation between animal and human health. These groupings were performed via a homemade database of mother companies and subsidiaries developed with Elsevier's business intelligence database2, companies' websites, annual reports, business intelligence reviews and websites...

Indian focus This section focuses on the 69 patent families having India as office of first filing. Contrary to the Brazilian patent office, Indian patent office only published electronically granted patent and not patent applications which therefore underestimates the number of filings. The figure below represents the evolution in filing. This figure shows that the number of patents is increasing since the beginning of the 2000s. The decreasing phenomena since 2007 might be explained by the grant lag of the Indian patent office which is about 34 years.

Introduction This section describes the search methodology developed to retrieve patents and patent applications claiming active constituents of human conjugate vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae . The narrative of this search history shows how the search was performed. It describes specific tools, databases, and challenges encountered and methods of circumventing. The search consisted generally of the use of combinations of keyword and classification searches, the intellectual review of search results for refining the queries and excluding irrelevant documents, and a final benchmarking of the search strategy through inclusion of documents cited in relevant documents. This section also discusses the limits of the use of patent classification codes (IPC, ECLA...) when looking for patents and patent applications dealing with active constituents of human conjugate vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae . 2.1.2. Methodology and databases A background study was first performed by looking at some literature on pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in order to collect keywords to build the patent queries and especially to help us determine the relevance of a patent family compared to another one, given that only patents describing \"active constituents\" had to be taken into account. Reviews such as Webster et al. BMC Public Health 2011, 11(Suppl 3):S26 were useful to make a list of keywords as well as general articles found on the Internet about the disease and its related vaccines3. A list of useful links can be found at the end of the section. As a next step, a review of patent classification was carried out to identify patent classification codes related to pneumococcal antigens. With the list of keywords and patent classification codes established such as described, queries were built and run into Patbase database (Minesoft TM). 3 http://www.who.int/wer/2007/wer8212.pdf http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine Vaccines for selected diseases 46 46 2.1.3. Background study 2.1.3.1 Review of the literature The bacterium responsible for Pneumonia was initially named Pneumococcus when it was discovered in 1881, to be then termed Diplococcus pneumoniae in 19744. In addition to Pneumonia, S. pneumoniae causes many types of pneumococcal infections such as acute sinusitis, otitis media, meningitis (one of the most common causes of bacterial meningitis in adults), bacteremia, sepsis, osteomyelitis, septic abscess. A conjugate, or conjugated vaccine, is a type of vaccine that is created by joining an antigen to a protein molecule. It usually consists of (but is not limited to) a polysaccharide antigen combined with a carrier protein. The protein part of a conjugate vaccine acts as a carrier for the antigen, and serves to magnify the immunological response to it. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) are used to protect infants and young children. There are currently three PCV vaccines available on the global market: Prevnar (called Prevenar in some countries), Synflorix and Prevnar 13. Prevnar (heptavalent vaccine) contains the cell membrane sugars of seven serotypes of pneumococcus, conjugated with Diphtheria proteins. It was manufactured by Wyeth (now Pfizer). The key patent family related to Prevnar is represented by US 5,360,897. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February 20005. Synflorix (decavalent vaccine) is produced by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) serotypes of pneumococcus (1, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) which are conjugated to a carrier protein. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency in January 2009 and received market approval of European Commission in March 2009. Synflorix is covered by the key patent family of EP22775356. Prevnar 13 (triskaivalent vaccine), produced by Pfizer, contains thirteen serotypes of pneumococcus (1, 3, 4, 19A, conjugated to a carrier protein. Prevnar 13 was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February 2010. 4 See, e.g.: http://www.who.int/wer/2007/wer8212.pdf http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine 5 http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccine s/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm137057.htm 6 http://www.gsk.com/media/pressrel eases/2009/2009_pressrelease_10039.htm Vaccines for selected diseases 47 47 List of patent studies http://www.who.int/vaccine_resea rch/documents/IVR_IPR_Tokyo_ Session2_McDiarmid_presentati on.pdf From this background study, a list of keywords was established. Keywords related to Pneumococcus conjugate: conjugate(d), glycoconjugate(s), as well as the words fused, fusion, linked, coupled, bound, associat(ed), attach(ed), merg(ed), peptidic, carrier(s) (and all related keywords) human pneumococcal conjugate vaccines: Prev(e)nar, Synflorix 2.1.3.2 Review of relevant classification codes By screening the international, European, American and Japanese patent classifications, the codes corresponding to medicinal preparations containing antigens or antibodies of Streptococcus were collected. The following codes were thereby identified: International Patent Classification (IPC): A61K39/09 [0] A61K39/00 A61K39/385 Haptens or antigens, bound to US Patent Classification (USPC): 424/237.1 [0] 424 Drug, bioaffecting and body epitope, or immunospecific tolerogen, immunospecific immunosuppressor, etc.). Subject matter involving an antigen, an epitope, or another immunospecific immunoeffector, such as an immunospecific vaccine, an immunospecific stimulator cellmediated immunity, an immunospecific tolerogen, or an immunospecific immunosuppressor. Vaccines for selected diseases 48 48 [2] 424/234.1 Bacterium or component thereof or substance produced by said bacterium (e.g., Legionella, Borrelia, Anaplasma, Shigella, etc.). Subject matter involving a bacterium, a component of a bacterium, or a substance produced by a bacterium. [3] 424/236.1 Toxin or toxoid, except endotoxin (e.g., exotoxin, enterotoxin, etc.). Subject matter involving a bacterial toxin or toxoid, except an endotoxin. [4] 424/237.1 Staphylococcus or Streptococcus. Subject matter wherein the toxin or toxoid originates from a bacterium of the genus Staphylococcus or from a bacterium of the genus Streptococcus. 424/193.1 [0] 424 Drug, bioaffecting and body epitope, or immunospecific complex. Subject matter involving a conjugate or a complex. (1) Note. A conjugate is taken to mean a coupling of one substance to another via covalent means, either directly via a covalent bond or indirectly via a chemical linking group. (2) Note. A complex is taken to mean a coupling of one substance to another via noncovalent means (e.g., via adsorption). (3) Note. The conjugates and complexes provided for in this subclass and indented subclasses are often of the haptencarrier type. A hapten is a substance that can bind an antibody, but which cannot induce production of an antibody unless it is coupled to a carrier that is immunogenic. A hapten is usually, but not always, of low molecular weight. Common carriers, for vaccination purposes in humans, are tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid. European classification (ECLA): A61K39/09, antigens [2] 49 Medicinal preparations containing antigens or Haptens or antigens, bound to carriers 2.1.4. Search strategy The patent search started by evaluating the number of patents and patent applications dealing with Streptococcus pneumoniae . Therefore, patent queries using truncations (mentioned by a * in the queries) of keywords related to Streptococcus pneumoniae were built. As the core of the invention is described in the title, abstract and claims of the patent family members, the queries were carried out in these fields (e.g. TAC in Patbase). 1.1.1.1. Keywordbased queries QUERY 1/ TAC=(pneumonia* OR pneumoco*) This query led to 7162 INPADOC families as search results. Most of the patent families did not refer to Streptococcus pneumoniae perimeter of search was thereby narrowed by specifying the genus of the bacteria or at least the abbreviated terminology (e.g S. pneumoniae ). query led to 2429 INPADOC families as search results. The families were related to Streptococcus pneumoniae but not yet to vaccines because many patents claimed antibiotics, diagnostic tests, methods of culture... The next step was therefore to limit the results to patent families claiming vaccines. QUERY 3/ (QUERY 2) AND TAC=(vaccin* OR antigen* OR immunogen* OR immunis* OR immuniz*) This query led to 1058 INPADOC families as search results. At this stage, there was a mix of patent families claiming conjugate vaccines and other type of vaccines as well as diagnostic methods, or therapeutic antibodies. It was therefore necessary to introduce a limitation to conjugate vaccines. QUERY 4/ (QUERY 3) AND TAC=(carrier* OR conjugat*) This query resulted in a list of 661 INPADOC families as search results. However, the set of results showed too much noise,i.e.e a high fraction of irrelevant patents because the keyword \"carrier\" also retrieved patent families related only to the delivery of vaccines. At this stage, it was therefore decided to suppress it and to use it later, associated with other keywords. QUERY 5/ (QUERY 3) AND TAC=(conjugat*) This query provided 396 INPADOC families as search results. However, some patent families did not refer to conjugate vaccines but to vaccines conjugated with pharmaceutical carriers to improve their Vaccines for selected diseases 50 50 delivery or to immunoconjugates (antibodies conjugated to chemical entities for a therapeutic use). Queries were therefore built to remove these patents (QUERY 6, QUERY 7). QUERY 6/ (QUERY 5) AND TAC=(conjugat* W10 pharmaceutic*) \"W10\" means \"10 words around\". This query led to 55 INPADOC families as search results. A review of these patent families was performed in order to distinguish these claiming both a conjugate pneumococcal vaccine and vaccines conjugated with pharmaceutical carriers, and these claiming only vaccines conjugated with pharmaceutical carriers. The patent families not within the scope of this study were stored in a folder in order to remove them afterwards. QUERY 7/ (QUERY 5) AND TAC=immunoconjugat * This query led to 15 INPADOC families as search results. All these patents did not refer to conjugate vaccines except one (US5785973) that used the term \"immunoconjugate\" to name a conjugate vaccine. When reviewing these patent, an \u00ab extended patent family \u00bb filed by IMMUNOMEDICS was identified as being outside the scope of the study. This \"extended family\" was referenced as \"VLF30687837 \u00bb in Patbase. It gathered 95 patent families and 23 of them were brought by QUERY 5. The patent families not entering in the scope of this study were stored in a folder in order to remove them afterwards. At this stage, a review of the set of results brought by QUERY 5 but without the patent families identified as out of the scope of the study (and stored in the folder \"patent families to be removed\") was performed. QUERY 8/ (QUERY 5) AND NOT RF= patent families to be removed 1 \"RF\" means \"Recorded Folder\" This query led to 357 INPADOC families. The review of these patent families highlighted many patents claiming a formulation of conjugate vaccines against meningitis combining conjugate vaccines of several agents responsible for this disease (e.g. Nesseiria antigens, pneumococcal antigens, hib antigens...). 37 patents were therefore eliminated and stored in the folder \"patent families to be removed\" in order to remove them afterwards. Among the other patent families brought by QUERY 8, many did not correspond to active constituents of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines but they described: Regimens of immunisation (e.g. US2008026002); Methods of (e.g. US2007009542; US2002094338; US2005070876; US2002010428; US2008066739; US2002038111); Vaccines for selected diseases 51 Administration of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in the regimens of vaccination against other pathogens (e.g. US2009047353 The method of claim 46, wherein the medicament is administered to a patient at substantially the same time as a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine); Description of vaccine formulations (e.g. US2002107265); Composition of multivalent vaccines in which additional antigens are added and among these potential additional antigens, pneumococcus is mentioned (e.g. US2007161088; US2006121059); Purification processes of antigens that could be used in the development of conjugate vaccines (e.g. US2008286838; CN102094053); Production of therapeutic antibodies (e.g. WO05070458; US2009191217; WO10094720); Methods of culture of microorganisms that could be used in the process of manufacturing pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (e.g. US2010290996); Detection methods such as evaluation of the efficacy of a pneumococcal (e.g. WO0074716); Methods using Pneumococcus polysaccharide conjugates for use against other infectious diseases (e.g. US2003099672; WO0062802); Methods that do not require conjugation to a carrier protein (e.g. US2009136547); immunomodulators (US2004156857; US5985264; WO11041691). All the patent families corresponding to such inventions were eliminated and stored in the folder \"patent families to be removed\" in order to remove them afterwards. At this stage, the folder \"patent families to be removed\" contained 248 patent families and it remained 148 patent families of QUERY 5 that dealt with active constituent of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. As QUERY 5 was analyzed and a first pool of relevant patent families was constituted, new queries were built to find out if other patent families not mentioning \"conjugate\" but answering to the description of \"conjugate vaccines\", by using other keywords, could be identified. The first step consisted in combining the words describing a conjugation such as fused, fusion, linked, coupled, bound, associat(ed), attach(ed), merg(ed), chimer(s), chimeric (and all related keywords) with describing the conjugated molecule such as protein(s), peptide(s), peptidic or carrier(s). OR W10 OR carrier*))) AND NOT (QUERY 5) \"~\": \"fuse~\" finds fuse, fused, fusing Vaccines for selected diseases 52 52 This query led to 159 INPADOC families but after reviewing them, only 14 families that were not retrieved dealt with adjuvants, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, use of pneumococcal protein (or peptide) as carrier. Most pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were based on glycoconjugates. Therefore, these keywords were tested to see if new patent families could be retrieved. QUERY 10/ ((QUERY 3) AND TAC=glycoconjugate*) AND NOT ((QUERY 4) OR (QUERY 9)) This query led to 2 INPADOC families but only one was relevant (WO11027116). As three pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are commercially available, it was interesting to see if the trade mark was used in the patent literature. QUERY 11/ TAC=(prevnar OR synflorix) AND NOT ((QUERY 4) OR (QUERY 9)) This query led to 2 INPADOC families but any relevant one. QUERY 12/ (TAC=((((D OR diplo*) WF1 pneumonia*)) AND conjuga*)) AND NOT ((QUERY 4) OR (QUERY 9)) This query led to 2 INPADOC families but only a relevant one. 1.1.1.2. Classification code based queries Once the keyword based queries were all tested, queries based on patent classification codes were tested. QUERY 13/ ((IC=A61K39/09 OR UC=424/237.1 OR EC=A61K39/09* OR JCI=A61K39/09) AND TAC=(pneumo* AND conjugat*) AND NOT ((QUERY 4) OR (QUERY 9)) \"IC\" means \"international patent classification \"UC\" means \"US patent classification \"EC\" means European classification \"JCI\" means Japan File Index This query led to 19 INPADOC families. After reviewing these families, only four were retrieved (PE13052007 ; NL300415; CO5241278; US5679768). QUERY 14/ (((IC= A61K39/385) AND (QUERY 2)) AND NOT ((QUERY 4) OR (QUERY 9)) This query led to 22 INPADOC families. After reviewing these families, 4 were retrieved (FR2475900 ; KR20020000785 ; US2002032323; US2003162260 (entitled vaccine adjuvant but corresponding to a conjugate vaccine). Vaccines for selected diseases 53 53 1.1.1.3. Queries with nonEnglish keywords After testing queries based on keywords and/or patent classification codes, queries were built with languages other than English (Latin and nonLatin). QUERY 15/ (QUERY 2 AND TAC=(conjug* OR konjug*) AND NOT ((QUERY 4) OR (QUERY 9) OR (QUERY 13) OR (QUERY 14))) This query led to 22 INPADOC families but only one claimed a vaccine (PE00602008). As with this query, no keywords specifically related to vaccine were used, most of the patent claimed treatments or detection methods based on conjugation. QUERY 16/ [RU]: TAC=(( ) AND ) means \"Vaccine\" QUERY AND ) \" \" means \"Vaccine\" QUERY AND ) \" \" means \"Vaccine\" QUERY AND ) \" \" means \"Streptococcus pneumoniae \" \" \" means \"Vaccine\" By combining non Latin language terms (in Russian (RU), Japanese (JP), Chinese (CN) and Korean (KR)) and removing the previous ones ,i.e. (QUERY 15 OR QUERY 16 OR QUERY 17 OR QUERY 18) AND NOT (QUERY 4 OR QUERY 9 OR QUERY 12 OR QUERY 13 OR QUERY 14)), 83 patent families were retrieved. After reviewing these families, many of them claimed vaccines but not conjugate vaccines (which is normal since no keyword related to conjugate was used to simplify the query) but this step allowed the recovery of 4 patent families not identified before (CN101024079 ; CN101130071; WO06065137; WO9839450). These patents were not initially retrieved because of problem of machine translation that gave orthographic errors of translated keywords. 1.1.1.4. Consistency analysis of the patent pool Vaccines for selected diseases 54 54 The citation analysis of the patent pool leads to a list of the most cited patents. These most cited patents were either already in our patent pool or outside. The patent families that were not included in the pool were checked and did not lead to the identification of further relevant patent families. This confirms that the search strategy does not need further refinement with complementary keywords or IPC codes or else. 1.1.1.5. Refinement of the patent pool and final database A total of 33 INPADOC patent families needed a review by technical experts in order to determine their relevancy. A list of 33 potentially relevant INPADOC patent families were identified and reviewed in collaboration with the WIPO and WHO in order to validate or eliminate them from the final database. The final database on human pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, created 3rd November 2011, contains 165 relevant INPADOC patent families (22 INPADOC patent families were excluded through this second manual review) . 2.2. Statistical analysis 2.2.1. Number and evolution of patent filings and grants Total number of patent families claiming active ingredients of human pneumococcal conjugate vaccines 165 Total different patents & patent applications 951 Average INPADOC Family Size 5.7 patents or applications/family Granted patents 43% PCT applications 68% Table 8 - General statistics of patent filings and grants The patent search resulted in 165 INPADOC families of patents and patent applications published until October 2011. These 165 patent families include 951 patents or published applications. Among these 165 patent families, 71 included one or more granted patents. These 165 patent families contain three \"Complex Patent Families\" (CPF): One claiming the US19910656773 priority (6 patent families out of 46 patent families of this CPF were included in this database) (filed by UNIV ALABAMA and/or UAB RESEARCH FOUNDATION) One claiming the GB19990006437 or the GB19990009077 priority (11 patent families out of 24 patent families of this CPF were included in this database) (filed by GSK) One claiming the GB20050026232 priority (11 patent families out of 44 patent families of this CPF were included in this database) (filed by GSK) Vaccines for selected diseases 55 55 For more information on how families are built, please refer to WIPO standards references on Patent Family7 or other references on the Internet 8 Granted patents were identified by creating a query based on kind codes related to granted patents of all patenting authorities and applying it to the patent pool of active ingredients of human pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Each patenting office has its own kind code system. For example, publications of the European Patent Office having a \"B\" kind code are granted patents, whereas publications having an \"A1, A2, A3\" kind code are applications. For the US Patent and Trademark Office, publications with an \"A\" kind code published before November 2000 and publications with kind code \"B1, B2\" are granted patent while publications with an \"A1, A2\" kind code published after November 2000 are applications. Families having granted family members do not necessarily mean that protection has entered into force or that the patent is still valid. Granted patents may not be in force for several reasons including that the patent term expired, that fees have not been paid, or that it did not survive opposition or revocation procedures. The figure below describes patenting activity over time and gives a view of patent grant rate in the field of active ingredients of human pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. The graph represents the number of patent families (Y axis) over the year of first filing (X axis). This year (priority year) was chosen rather than the publication year, as this is more indicative of patenting activities since they are less dependent on the varying publication policies and docket backlogs of patent offices. The count of families for each year of first filing is split into two fractions according to whether families included at least one granted patent or not. The graph shows an increase in filings up to 1999, and then a second spike up to 2005. The small fraction of grants in younger families reflects the pendency of patent issue, i.e. the time between the filing of an application and the grant of a patent which varies from a patent office to another and can last for several years (e.g. about 4 years for patents issued by EPO). In the 1990s, more than 70% of patent families contained at least one granted patent while, after 2000, this rate did not go beyond 50%. The small fraction of grants in younger families (since 2005) reflects the pendency of patent issue, i.e. the time between the filing of an application and the grant of a patent which varies from a patent office to another and can last for several years (e.g. about 4 years for patents issued by EPO). For these families the examination of family members may still be pending or may not be requested yet. For earlier years of filing, national publication policies and the evolution of national patent legislation have to be taken into account. For example, until November 2000, the US patent office only published granted US patents. Thereby, US applications that were not granted were in fact never published. For the coverage of national databases used in this study, please refer to corresponding 7 http://www.wipo.int/standards/en/pdf/08 0101.pdf 8 http://www.intellogist.c om/wiki/Patent_Families Vaccines for selected diseases 56 56 appendix. In addition, because of the 18 months of publication delay after the date of patent filing, the data after 2009 are incomplete. Figure 19 - Evolution of the number of granted and not granted patent families per year of first filing A PCT application was filed for a large majority of patent families. In the figure below, it can be noted that peaks in 1991, 1999 and 2005 concerning patent families without PCT applications are only due to the \"Complex Patent Families\". Vaccines for selected diseases 57 57 Figure 20 - Evolution of the number of patent families with and without PCT applications per year of first filing The table below lists the office of origin of all PCT applications. This table was established by looking at the application number of a PCT filing that mentions the office of origin of the PCT (e.g. 2008WO FR00687, this PCT application was filed via the French patent office). Office of first filing Number of PCT applications UNITED STATES 50 EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE (EPO) 22 INTERNATIONAL BUREAU (WIPO) 13 FRANCE 5 UNITED KINGDOM 5 ISRAEL 4 CANADA 3 DENMARK 3 KOREA 2 NETHERLANDS 2 AUSTRALIA 1 ITALY 1 JAPAN 1 Table 9 - Origin of PCT applications PCT applications were mainly filed with national or regional offices and only few directly with the international bureau. Vaccines for selected diseases 58 58 2.2.2. Location of first filings An analysis of the place of filing of priority patents results in the following table. A map of these filings can be seen in appendix. The location of priority filings and their evolution may give an indication of the country of origin of applicants and the dynamic of innovation in these countries. Table 10 - Evolution of first filings by offices Early patent applications were filed in France but the United States and to a lesser extent the United Kingdom largely dominate as offices of first filing. The important number of priority filings in the red circled number is due to the presence of \"Complex Patent Families\". Although a recent emergence of China can be seen through this analysis, it is not yet significant in terms of filings. In order to have a better understanding of the country of origin and the innovation dynamic in these countries, it is more appropriate to take a look at the number of filings according to inventors' place of residence rather than the office of first filing. To be able to make these statistics, the data related to Inventor's country (extracted from the address of the inventor), indexed in FamPat database (QuestelTM), was used. To do this, patent families of the database \"Active Ingredients of human pneumococcal vaccines\" were loaded into FamPat. This did not change the number of retrieved patent families although the definition of FamPat families is a little different from INPADOC families (FAMPAT families are built with patent applications having exactly the same priority whereas INPADOC families are built with patent applications having at least one priority patent application in common). Then, the number of filings naming at least one inventor coming from a country in particular was then counted. It should be noted that totals of the two categories of the table are different because the inventors indicated in an individual patent application may have different countries of residence; each country was counted once, e.g. an application with two inventors residing in Belgium and one inventor residing in the United Kingdom would result in one count for each country. 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 9 091 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 Total PCT WORLD 2 2 UNITED STATES 22 11 2944 1427532 1622632 1 1 18 3 CANADA 11 EUROPE 1 1 1 1 1 5 UNITED KINGDOM 1 15 3 11 41 13 6 2 47 F R A N C E 11 1 1 11 1 7 DENMARK 11 1 3 ITALY 1 2 3 GERMANY 1 1 2 SWEDEN 2 2 CHINA 11 1 1 2 6 KOREA 1 1 2 JAPAN 1 1 AUSTRALIA AUSTRALIA 1 1 112002101232 1 0 44145 1 0 7 1 9 62398 1 610 1 04 13 5 165AMERICA EUROPE ASIA Total Vaccines for selected diseases 59 59 Number of filings in each patent authorityNumber of filings according to inventors' place of residence PCT WORLD 2 / UNITED STATES 83 67 CANADA 1 11 BRAZIL / 1 EUROPE 5 / UNITED KINGDOM 47 9 FRANCE 7 9 DENMARK 3 4 ITALY 3 20 GERMAN Y 23 SWEDEN 2 2 BELGIUM / 26 ICELAND / 1 AUSTRIA / 2 NETHERLAND / 7 BELARUS / 1 INDIA / 2 CHINA 6 7 KOREA 2 3 JAPAN 1 1 MIDDLE EAST ISRAE L /1 AUSTRALIA AUSTRALIA 1 2 165 179 TotalAMERICA EUROPE ASIAEURASIA Table 11 - Comparison between place of filings and origin of the inventors Based on these data, it was noted that Canadian innovation tends to be first protected through the US patent office and that that Italian, Dutch and Belgian tends to be first protected through the UK patent offices. Several reasons can coexist to explain these differences: The interest in specific cases to use US provisional patents (even when the innovation do not stems from US inventors) The difference in location of patent officers and research team. For example, 26 applications filed by Belgian inventors but no filing registered at the Belgian patent office. This is explained by the fact that GSK vaccine research team is located in Belgium but files in the United Kingdom where are located the headquarters. On the same way, NOVARTIS/CHIRON research team is located in Italy but files in the United Kingdom. The interest of filing directly in English to lessen future translation fees Vaccines for selected diseases 60 60 2.2.3. Average family size per office of first filing These data were established by looking at the publication numbers of each family in order to extract the number of offices in which the applications were filed. However, for patent and patent applications of European countries filed via the European Procedure, a different counting was carried out because of specificities of European procedures. According to the designated and chosen offices, a new patent application number is attributed by these offices or not. For instance, German patent office will deliver a number (DE123456) after an extension via the European procedure while France will use the EP number (EP654321). When looking at the patent families via the patent & patent application numbers, it therefore created, improperly, a higher number of German extensions compared to French ones. Consequently, when a patent family contained a patent application filed via the EPO, the numbers issued by the selected offices (during the national phases) were not recorded. These numbers were counted only if no EP filing was part of the family. In addition, only one document per office was taken into account when calculating the family size in order not to count twice the patent application and the issued patent.

The US and GB patent families are divided in two main groups: these that were never extended and these with a high number of extension (~12) which lead to an average family size of middle value but with a high standard deviation. 2.2.4. Location of second filings An analysis of the location of second filings results in the following histogram. A map compiling these data can be found in the corresponding appendix. Countries chosen for the extension of priority filings are an indicator of the markets and/or the production sites. The choice of countries may also be guided by company's competitors and potential infringers, even if there is no market in these Vaccines for selected diseases 61 61 corresponding territories. In Life Sciences, the choice can also be guided by usual locations of clinical trials (Poland, Hungary, Thailand, India...). These data were established by looking at the patent numbers of each family without taking into account the number delivered by the office of first filing (see previous section for the explanation of the calculation). Figure 21 - Number of applications in th e offices of second filings Many second filings were performed via the PCT procedure (as seen in the previous section it represents 68% of the patent applications). The European patent office (EPO), Canada, Australia and Japan also dominate as offices of second filings. Beware that the importance of Australia must be understood in relation to the policy of the Australian patent office which automatically delivered an Australian patent number when the PCT mentions Australia even if no extension were filed in Australia during the national phase.

Analysis of applicants Two types of applicants can be distinguished: institutional and industrial ones. The evolution of institutional vs. industrial priority filings (figure below) outlines the strong presence of industrial filings. Only few and old applications were jointly filed by an industrial and an institutional applicants. Vaccines for selected diseases 64 64 Figure 23 - Number of Institutional/Industrial/Individua l priority filings per year of first filing The following graph shows the main applicants classified by the size of their patent portfolio. Co filings are counted for each coowner. For instance, a patent application cofiled between US Government and GSK is counted once for US Government and once for GSK. Figure 24 - List of main applicants ( 2 patent or patent applications) INDUSTRIAL APPLICANTS INSTITUTIONAL APPLICANTS Vaccines for selected diseases 65 65 The large pharmaceutical company, GSK, dominates in terms of number of patent families. It should however be noted that GSK has three \"Complex Patent Families \" that increases artificially the number of families due to the filings of Continuation in Part and Divisional but claiming the same Priority. When not taking these \"Complex Patent Families\" into account, GSK, Novartis, Pfizer and to a lesser extent Merck&Co, Sanofi Aventis and Baxter have a similar profile. Please note that affiliates/subsidiaries were gathered under their parent company. These groupings were performed via a homemade database of mother companies and subsidiaries developed with Elsevier's business intelligence database9, companies' websites, annual reports, business intelligence reviews and websites...

Figure 25 - Main applicants' preferred offices of first filings Figure 26 - Main applicants' preferred offices of second filings Vaccines for selected diseases 67 67 The following graph details the evolution of first filings by applicant. The year corresponds to the first priority year of the patent family. Such a graph allows the identification of pioneer or emerging applicants in terms of filings. Figure 27 - Evolution of main applicants' filings (by year of first filing) Pasteur Institute was the first research centre to file patent application about pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Among the most active applicants, it can be noted that the Henry M. Jackson foundation and the UAB research foundation only filed patent applications before 2000 while GSK and Novartis filed the majority of their patent applications after 2000. Pfizer, the US government laboratories and to a lesser extent Merck & Co and Baxter have regularly filed patent applications since their first filing. Among the emerging applicants, the company Protea Vaccine Technologies has to be considered. Among the first three applicants, only Novartis is not marketing pneumococcal conjugate vaccines yet but this might be explained by the fact that this company was very active in this field only recently. The following table details the average family size by applicant. Please note that, because of the particular numbering of patent applications filed during the national phase of the European procedure (see section 2.2.3. for the detailed explanation), when a patent family contained a patent application filed via the EPO, the numbers delivered by the selected offices (during the national phases) were not recorded. These numbers were counted only if no EP filing was part of the family. Vaccines for selected diseases 68 68 In addition, only one document per office was taken into account when calculating the family size in order not to count twice the patent application and the issued patent. These data show that institutional applicants tend to file smaller families compared to industrial applicants.

Active ingredients of human typhoid conjugate vaccines 3.1. Search methodology 3.1.1. Introduction This section describes the search methodology developed to retrieve patents and patent applications claiming active constituents of human conjugate vaccines against typhoid. The narrative of this search history shows how the search was performed. It describes specific tools, databases, and challenges encountered and methods of circumventing. The search consisted generally of the use of combinations of keyword and classification searches, the intellectual review of search results for refining the queries and excluding irrelevant documents, and a final benchmarking of the search strategy through inclusion of documents cited in relevant documents. This section also discusses the limits of the use of patent classification codes (IPC, ECLA...) when looking for patents and patent applications dealing with active constituents of human conjugate vaccines against typhoid. 3.1.2. Methodology and databases A background study was first performed by looking at some literature on typhoid conjugate vaccines in order to collect keywords to build the patent queries and especially to help us determine the relevance of a patent family compared to another one, given that only patent describing \"active constituents\" had to be taken into account. Articles such as Audino Podda, et al., J Infect Dev Ctries, 2010; 4(6):404411 were useful to make a list of keywords as well as general articles found on the Internet about the disease and its related vaccines10. As a next step, a review of patent classification was carried out to identify patent classification codes related to typhoid antigens. With the list of keywords and patent classification codes established such as described, queries were built and run into FAMPAT database (QuestelTM). Therefore this document present the FAMPAT queries used to identify the relevant patent families of this focus. However, the final database, from where the statistical analyses were setup, was created using INPADOC Review of the literature Typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella enterica , serovar typhi (S. typhi ). This worldwide illness is transmitted by the ingestion of food or water contaminated by excreta from infected person or chronic carriers. Enteric fevers also include paratyphoid fever caused by strains of three species of Salmonellae that are Salmonella paratyphi A, S. paratyphi B (or S. schottmuelleri ) and S. paratyphi C (S. hirschfeldii ). The paratyphoid bears similarities with typhoid fever, but its course is more benign. Recent studies showed that around 22 million cases of typhoid fever occur each year. About 1% of the infected persons died from this illness with higher incidence in children and young adults between 5 and 19 years old. As typhoid and paratyphoid do not affect animals, the transmission occurs only from human to human. In addition, it can only spread in contaminated environments where human excreta come into contact with water or food. Prevention therefore involves in priority sanitation and hygiene. However vaccines remain crucial for the limitation of these illnesses. Apart from the heatkilled injectable wholecell S. typhi vaccine used as far back as 1896 and still licensed today in several countries in spite of its high reactogenicity, two recent vaccines are currently recommended by the WHO for the prevention of typhoid. The injectable Vi polysaccharide vaccine (US5204098) was developed at the NIH in the 80's and licensed to SanofiPasteur (Typhim TM, SanofiPasteur; Typherix vaccine (US4632830) was developed at the \"Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute Berne\" in the 80's and licensed to Berna Biotech now acquired by Dutch company Crucell (Vivotif TM, Crucell). Both demonstrated their efficacy in multiple randomized trials (between 50% to 80% protective) and are widely used worlwide. Several other live attenuated S. typhi vaccines are currently in development and seem to be even more immunogenic than Ty21a vaccine. Due to the fact that classical used vaccines are poorly immunogenic in infant and cannot be used to vaccinate children less than 2 years of age, development of conjugate vaccines is a major necessity. Two typhoid conjugate vaccines are currently in development, one at the NIH using recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A as the protein carrier and the second at ALL India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi using the OmpC protein from S. typhi as carrier. A conjugate vaccine, or conjugated vaccine, is a type of vaccine that is created by joining an antigen to a protein molecule. It usually consists in (but is not limited to) a polysaccharide antigen combined with a carrier protein. The protein part of a conjugate vaccine acts as a carrier for the antigen, and serves to magnify the immunological response to it. From this background study, a list of keywords was established. Keywords related to typhoid: typhoid, paratyphoid, Keywords related to conjugate vaccines: conjugate(d), glycoconjugate(s), as well as the words linked, coupled, bound, associat(ed), attach(ed), merg(ed), peptidic, carrier(s) (and all related keywords) Keywords related conjugate 3.1.3.2 Review of the relevant classification codes By screening the international, European, American and Japanese patent classifications, the codes corresponding to medicinal preparations containing antigens or antibodies of Salmonella typhi or Salmonella paratyphi were collected. The following codes were thereby identified: International Patent Classification (IPC): A61K39/112 [0] A61K39/00 A61K39/385 Haptens or antigens, bound to US Patent Classification (USPC): 424/258.1 [0] 424 Drug, bioaffecting and body epitope, or immunospecific tolerogen, immunospecific immunosuppressor, etc.). Subject matter involving an antigen, an epitope, or another immunospecific immunoeffector, such as an immunospecific vaccine, an immunospecific stimulator or an immunospecific immunosuppressor. [2] 424/234.1 Bacterium or component thereof or substance produced by said bacterium (e.g., Legionella, Borrelia, Anaplasma, Shigella, etc.). Subject matter involving a bacterium, a component of a bacterium, or a substance produced by a bacterium. [3] 424/258.1 Salmonella (e.g., Salmonella typhimurium, etc.). Subject matter wherein the bacterium is of the genus Salmonella. 424/193.1 [0] 424 Drug, bioaffecting and body treating compositions epitope, or immunospecific complex. Subject matter involving a conjugate or a complex. (1) Note. A conjugate is taken to mean a coupling of one substance to another via covalent means, either directly via a covalent bond or indirectly via a chemical linking group. (2) Note. A complex is taken to mean a coupling of one substance to another via noncovalent means (e.g., via adsorption). (3) Note. The conjugates and complexes provided for in this subclass and indented subclasses are often of the haptencarrier type. A hapten is a substance that can bind an antibody, but which cannot induce production of an antibody unless it is coupled to a carrier that is immunogenic. A hapten is usually, but not always, of low molecular weight. Common carriers, for vaccination purposes in humans, are tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid. European classification (ECLA): A61K39/02T, Haptens or antigens, bound to carriers 3.1.4. Search strategy The patent search started by evaluating the patents and patent applications retrieved by the classification codes based query. In a second time, the results of patent searches using keywords combination were evaluated. Therefore, patent queries using truncations (mentioned by a + in the queries) of keywords related to Salmonella typhi , paratyphi , vaccines and conjugates were built. As the core of the invention is described in the title, abstract and claims of the patent family members, the queries were carried out in these fields (e.g. BI/CL in Questel). 4.1.3.1 Classification codes based queries QUERY 1: a first combination of classification codes led to 877 FAMPAT patent families. ((A61K039/112)/IC) OU ((424258100)/PCLO) OU ((A61K039/02T classification means \"US patent classification \"ECLA\" means European classification \"FI\" means Japan File Index For the rest of the document, please refer to the appendix. 877 results The results are not specific to Salmonella typhi (e.g. Shigella, Salmonella typhimurium ...), not specific to conjugate vaccines (e.g. diagnostic, adjuvant ...) and not specific to human. QUERY 2: a second combination of classifications codes led to 82 FAMPAT patent families.

Salmonella typhimurium causes gastroenteritis in humans and other mammals and is not involved in typhoid or paratyphoid fevers. The patent families brought by the word typhimurium were then analyzed to confirm this idea. QUERY 4: check of the patent families containing the key word \"typhimurium\" (((typhoid+ OU ET (typhimurium OU (typhi murium))/BI/CLMS 274 results Most of the documents did not enter in the scope of the study. They claimed vaccines against pathologies caused by Salmonella typhimurium or other technologies using Salmonella typhimurium antigens. However, 11 FAMPAT (Questel) patent families that seem relevant and 9 potentially relevant were saved manually using their publication numbers. All these patent families were reviewed in collaboration with the WIPO and WHO in a second time in order to validate or eliminate them from the final database. Example of relevant patent family WO2005110471: Preparation of salmonella broadspectrum vaccines Example of potentially relevant patent family WO8809669: Avirulent microbes and uses therefor: Salmonella typhi EP1539978: Method of isolating biologically active fraction containing clinically acceptable native Slipopolysaccharides obtained from bacteria producing endotoxic lipopolysaccharides QUERY OU (typhi murium))/BI/CLMS 224 results After reviewing the dataset, only 31 relevant FAMPAT patent families and 26 potentially relevant FAMPAT patent families were saved using their publication numbers. All these patent families were reviewed in collaboration with the WIPO and WHO in a second time in order to validate or eliminate them from the final database. Other patent families claimed a variety of technologies mentioning the keywords used in the query but that did not correspond to active constituents of typhoid conjugate vaccines: Detection methods (e.g. IN02598MU2008, CN102053153, KR20100101288, CA2084083) Description of vaccine formulations (e.g. WO2011014418) Methods of administration and delivery systems antibodies (e.g. WO9735884, DK63187, EP1833510) In order to enlarge the query and check new patent families that could enter in the scope of the study, we decided to simplify the query writing \"typhi+ OU paratyphi+\" instead of immuniz+) ET (carrier+ OU +conjugat+))/BI/CLMS) 8 families were retrieved after removing the 498 FAMPAT patent families already reviewed No relevant patent families were identified Another investigation was conducted, adding new keywords to the field of keywords related to conjugate vaccines such as protein, peptide, polysaccharide and chimeric.

After reviewing these families, no new relevant patent families were retrieved. Consistency analysis of the patent pool The citation analysis of the patent pool led us to a list of the most cited patents. These most cited patents were either already in our patent pool or outside. The patent families that were not included in the pool were checked and did not lead to the identification of further relevant patent families. This confirms that the search strategy does not need further complementary refinement with complementary keywords or IPC codes, or else. Refinement of the patent pool and final database A total of 80 INPADOC patent families needed a review by technical experts in order to determine their relevancy. These 80 relevant or potentially relevant FAMPAT patent families (corresponding to 73 INPADOC patent families) were reviewed in collaboration with the WIPO and WHO in order to validate or eliminate them from the final database. The final database on human typhoid conjugate vaccines, created 5th October 2011, contained 36 relevant INPADOC patent families (37 INPADOC patent families were excluded after this second manual review) . These 36 relevant INPADOC patent families correspond to 44 FAMPAT patent families. 3.2. Statistical analysis 3.2.1. Number and evolution of patent filings and grants Total number of patent families claiming active ingredients of human typhoid conjugate vaccines 36 Total different patents & patent applications 158 Average INPADOC Family Size 4.4 patents or applications/family Granted patents 30.5% PCT applications 66.7% Table 18 - General statistics of patent filings and grants The patent search resulted in 36 families of patents and patent applications published until October 2011. These 36 patent families include 158 patents or published applications. Among these 36 patent families, 11 included one or more granted patents. These patent families did not contain any \"Complex Patent Families\". Granted patents were identified by creating a query based on kind codes related to granted patents of all patenting authorities and applying it to the patent pool of active ingredients of human pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Each patenting office has its own kind code system. For example, publications of the European Patent Office having a \"B\" kind code are granted patents, whereas publications having an \"A1, A2, A3\" kind code are applications. For the US Patent and Trademark Office, publications with an \"A\" kind code published before November 2000 and publications with kind code \"B1, B2\" are granted patent while publications with an \"A1, A2\" kind code published after November 2000 are applications. Families having granted family members do not necessarily mean that protection has entered into force at all or the patent is still valid. Granted patents may not be in force for several reasons including that the patent term expired, that fees have not been paid, or that it did not survive opposition or revocation procedures. The figure below describes patenting activity over time and gives a view of patent grant rate in the field of active ingredients of human typhoid conjugate vaccines. The graph represents the number of patent families (Y axis) over the year of first filing (X axis). This year (priority year) was chosen rather than the publication year, as this is more indicative of patenting activities since they are less dependent on the varying publication policies and docket backlogs of patent offices. The count of families for each year of first filing is split into two fractions according to whether families included at least one granted patent or not. The graph shows rather continuous filings all over the period with two small peaks of filings in 2005 and 2007. The small fraction of grants in younger families (since 2005) reflects the pendency of patent issue, i.e. the time between the filing of an application and the grant of a patent which varies from a patent office to another and can last for several years (e.g. about 4 years for patents issued by EPO). For earlier years of filing, national publication policies and the evolution of national patent legislation have to be taken into account. For example, until November 2000, the US patent office published only granted US patents. Thereby, US applications that were not granted were in fact never published. For the coverage of national databases used in this study, please refer to corresponding appendix. In addition, because of the 18 months of publication delay after the date of patent filing, the data after 2009 are incomplete. Figure 29 - Evolution of the number of granted and not granted patent families per year of first filing A PCT application was filed for a large majority of patent families. Only 8 families did not contain a PCT application. Figure 30 - Evolution of the number of patent families with and without PCT applications per year of first filing The table below lists the office of origin of all PCT applications. This table was established by looking at the application number of a PCT filing that mentions the office of origin of the PCT (e.g. 2008WO FR00687, this PCT application was filed via the French patent office). Office of first filing Number of PCT applications UNITED STATES 11 EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE (EPO) 6 INDIA 5 CANADA 1 CUBA 1 FRANCE 1 INTERNATIONAL BUREAU (WIPO) 1 UNITED KINGDOM 1 Table 19 - Origin of PCT applications PCT applications were mostly filed with national or regional offices and only few directly with the international bureau. 3.2.2. Location of first filings An analysis of the place of filing of priority patents results in the following table. A map of these filings can be seen in appendix. The location of priority filings and their evolution may give an indication of the country of origin of applicants and the dynamic of innovation in these countries. First patent applications were filed in the United States that still dominate this sector as office of first filing. It can also be noted some recent filings stemming from the United Kingdom and India. 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 Total WORLD 11 1 3 UNITED STATES 1 1 2 11 1 1 1 1 2 11 1 1 5 CUBA 11 EUROPE 11 UNITED KINGDOM 2 4 17 FRANCE 1 1 INDIA 4 15 CHINA 11 KOREA 11 SINGAPORE 1 1 10000012011101110131032161512 3 6AMERICA EUROPE ASIA Total Table 20 - Evolution of first filings by offices In order to have a better understanding of the country of origin and the innovation dynamic in these countries, it is more appropriate to take a look at the number of filings according to inventors' place of residence rather than the office of first filing. To be able to make these statistics, the data related to Inventor's country (extracted from the address of the inventor), indexed in FamPat database (QuestelTM), was used. To do this, patent families of the database \"Active Ingredients of human pneumococcal vaccines\" were loaded into FamPat. This did not change the number of retrieved patent families although the definition of FamPat families is a little different from INPADOC families (FAMPAT families are built with patent applications having exactly the same priority whereas INPADOC families are built with patent applications having at least one priority patent application in common). Then, the number of filings naming at least one inventor coming from a country in particular was then counted. It should be noted that totals of the two categories of the table are different because the inventors indicated in an individual patent application may have different countries of residence; each country was counted once, e.g. an application with two inventors residing in Belgium and one inventor residing in the United Kingdom would result in one count for each country. Based on these data, it was noted that innovations stemming from Italian and Belgian inventors tend to be first protected through the UK patent office. Several reasons can coexist to explain these differences: The difference in location of patent officers and research team (GSK vaccine research team is located in Belgium but files in the United Kingdom, NOVARTIS/CHIRON research team is located in Italy but files in the United Kingdom) The interest of filing directly in English to lessen future translation fees Number of filings in each patent authorityNumber of filings according to inventors' place of residence PCT WORLD 3 UNITED STATES 15 14 CUBA 1 1 CANADA 2 AMERICA BRAZIL 1 EUROPE 1 UNITED KINGDOM 7 3 FRANCE 1 2 SWITZERLAND 1 ITALY 3 GERMANY 1 BELGIUM 5 NETHERLAND 1 EUROPE SLOVAKIA 1 INDIA 5 6 CHINA 1 1 ASIA KOREA 1 1 AFRICA GHANA 1 AUSTRALIA AUSTRALIA 1 Total 36 45 Table 21 - Comparison between place of filings and origin of the inventors 3.2.3. Average family size per office of first filing These data were established by looking at the publication numbers of each family in order to extract the number of offices in which the applications were filed. However, for patent and patent applications of European countries filed via the European Procedure, a different counting was carried out because of specificities of European procedures. According to the designated and chosen offices, a new patent application number is attributed by these offices or not. For instance, German patent office will deliver a number (DE123456) after an extension via the European procedure while France will use the EP number (EP654321). When looking at the patent families via the patent & patent application numbers, it therefore created, improperly, a higher number of German extensions compared to French ones. Consequently, when a patent family contained a patent application filed via the EPO, the numbers issued by the selected offices (during the national phases) were not recorded. These numbers were counted only if no EP filing was part of the family. In addition, only one document per office was taken into account when calculating the family size in order not to count twice the patent application and the issued patent. Office of first filing Average family size Standard deviation CHINA (CN) 1 CUBA (CU) 7 EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE (EPO) 8 FRANCE (FR) 9 UNITED KINGDOM (GB) 4 2.5 INDIA (IN) 2.2 1.6 KOREA (KR) 1 SINGAPORE (SG) 2 UNITED STATES (US) 5.4 3.7 INTERNATIONAL BUREAU (WIPO) 3.3 1.5 Table 22 - Average family and standard deviation size per office of first filing US and UK patent families are divided in two main groups: those that were never extended and those with a high number of extensions (~10) which lead to a family size of medium value but with a high standard deviation. 3.2.4. Location of second filings An analysis of the location of second filings results in the following histogram. A map compiling these data can be found in the corresponding appendix. Countries chosen for the extension of priority filings are an indicator of the markets and/or the production sites. The choice of countries may also be guided by company's competitors and potential infringers, even if there is no market in these corresponding territories. In Life Sciences, the choice can also be guided by usual locations of clinical trials (Poland, Hungary, Thailand, India...). Figure 31 - Number of applications in th e offices of second filings Many second filings were performed via the PCT procedure (as seen in the previous section it represents 68% of the patent applications). The European patent office (EPO), Australia and Canada dominate as offices of second filings. Beware that the importance of Australia must be understood in relation to the policy of the Australian patent office which automatically delivered an Australian patent number when the PCT mentions Australia even if no extension were filed in Australia during the national phase. 3.2.5. Breakdown of filings by IPC codes The figure below shows the most common relevant IPC codes present in the database. IPC Definition Number of patent & patent applications A61K39385 Medicinal preparations containing antigens or antibodies, Haptens or antigens, bound to carriers 19 A61K39112 Medicinal preparations containing antigens or antibodies, Bacterial antigens, Salmonella; Shigella 17 A61K47 Medicinal preparations characterised by the nonactive ingredients used, e.g. carriers, inert additives [2] 12 A61P31 Antiinfectives, i.e. antibiotics, antiseptics, chemotherapeutics, Antibacterial agents 12 C07K14195 more than 20 amino acids; from bacteriaGastrins; Somatostatins; Melanotropins; Derivatives thereof 7 C12N15 Mutation or genetic engineering; DNA or RNA concerning genetic engineering, vectors, e.g. plasmids, or their isolation, preparation or purification 7 A61P37 Drugs for immunological or allergic disorders (e.g. immunomodulators) 6 C07K17 Carrierbound or immobilised peptides; Preparation thereof 6 Other A61K39 Medicinal preparations containing antigens or antibodies (except A61K3909) 5 Other C07K14 Peptides having more than 20 amino acids; Gastrins; Somatostatins; Melanotropins; Derivatives thereof 4 A61K3574 Medicinal preparations containing material or reaction products thereof with undetermined constitution, from bacteria 3 C07K14255 Peptides having more than 20 amino acids; Gastrins; Somatostatins; Melanotropins; Derivatives thereof, from bacteria Salmonella (G) C07K16 Immunoglobulins, e.g. monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies 3 C07K19 immunoglobulins composed solely of immunoglobulins C07K 16/46) 3 G01N33 Investigating or analysing materials by specific methods not covered by groups G01N 1/00G01N 31/00 2 A61K39385 Medicinal preparations containing antigens or antibodies, Haptens or antigens, bound to carriers 19 IPC Definition Number of patent & patent applications A61K39112 Medicinal preparations containing antigens or antibodies, Bacterial antigens, Salmonella; Shigella 17 Table 23 - Number of patent families classified within relevant IPC codes Figure 32 - Number of patent families classified within relevant IPC codes per year of first filing No clear trend can be highlighted by the analysis of the evolution of IPC codes. 3.2.6. Analysis of applicants Two types of applicants can be distinguished: institutional and industrial ones. The evolution of institutional vs. industrial priority filings (figure below) shows an equivalent sharing of the portfolio between this two types of applicants. Only few applications were jointly filed by an industrial and an institutional applicants. Figure 33 - Number of Institutional/Industrial/Individua l priority filings per year of first filing The following graph shows the main applicants classified by the size of their patent portfolio. Cofilings are counted for each coowner. For instance, a patent application cofiled between US Government and GSK is counted once for US Government and once for GSK. Figure 34 - List of main applicants ( 2 patent or patent applications) INDUSTRIAL APPLICANTS INSTITUTIONAL APPLICANTS The US Government laboratories and GSK dominate in terms of number of patent families, followed closely by Indian research institutes, Pfizer, Johnson&Johnson and Sanofi Aventis. Please note that affiliates/subsidiaries were gathered under their parent company. These groupings were performed via a homemade database of mother companies and subsidiaries developed with Elsevier's business intelligence database11, companies' websites, annual reports, business intelligence reviews and websites...

Figure 37 - Evolution of main applicants' filings (by year of first filing) The US Government laboratories and Johnson&Johnson were the first applicants to file patent applications about typhoid conjugate vaccines but only the US Government laboratories kept filing over period. Please note that, because of the particular numbering of patent applications filed during the national phase of the European procedure (see section 3.2.3. for the detailed explanation), when a patent family contained a patent application filed via the EPO, the numbers delivered by the selected offices (during the national phases) were not recorded. These numbers were counted only if no EP filing was part of the family. In addition, only one document per office was taken into account when calculating the family size in order not to count twice the patent application and the issued patent.

Active ingredient of human influenza vaccines 4.1. Search methodology 4.1.1. Introduction This section describes the search methodology developed to retrieve patents and patent applications claiming active constituents of human vaccines against influenza virus . The narrative of this search history shows how the search was performed. It describes specific tools, databases, and challenges encountered and methods of circumventing. The search consisted generally of the use of combinations of keyword and classification searches, the intellectual review of search results for refining the queries and excluding irrelevant documents, and a final benchmarking of the search strategy through inclusion of documents cited in relevant documents. This section also discusses the limits of the use of patent classification codes (IPC, ECLA...) when looking for patents and patent applications dealing with active constituents of human vaccines against influenza virus . 4.1.2. Methodology and databases A background study was first performed by looking at some literature on human influenza vaccines in order to collect keywords to build the patent queries and especially to help us determine the relevance of a patent family compared to another one, given that only patent describing \"active constituents\" had to be taken into account. Reviews including patent studies12 were useful to make a list of keywords as well as general articles found on the Internet and patent families13 about influenza virus and its related vaccines. As a next step, a review of patent classification was carried out to identify patent classification codes related to human vaccines against influenza virus. 12 such as: \"A review of production technologies for influenza virus vaccines, and their suitability for deployment in developing countries for influenza pandemic preparedness \" conducted by the World Health Organization Initiative for Vaccine Research, the \"Working Paper on Patent issues related to influenza viruses and their genes \", prepared by WIPO at the request of the World Health Organization, the \"WIPO Patent search report on pandemic influenza preparedness (PIP)related patents and patent applications \", prepared by the International 13 http://www.who.int/in fluenza/vaccines/en/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae http://www.patentlens.net /daisy/influenza/4132.html http://www.boliven.com/boliven_lands capes/ip_report/Influenza_landscape With the list of keywords and patent classification codes established such as described, queries were built and run into FAMPAT database (QuestelTM). Therefore this document presents the FAMPAT queries used to identify the relevant patent families of this focus. However, the final database, from where the statistical analyses were setup, was created using INPADOC documents (Patbase export; MinesoftTM). 4.1.3. Background study 4.1.3.1 Review of the literature Influenza, commonly called as the flu, is an infectious disease caused by RNA viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae , which affects mammals and birds: the influenza viruses. These viruses infect the airways of a subject and cause general respiratory symptoms, fever and extreme coldness, weakness and fatigue, body aches, headache and even nausea and vomiting. In humans, influenza may result in morbidity and mortality rates, especially in children and elderly persons. Influenza viruses are divided in three subtypes: A, B the two most common causes of influenza in man and C. They are distinguishable by their antigenic determinants. Indeed, the influenza virions carry two major surface glycoprotein antigens, Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA). The HA and NA proteins are most susceptible to vary with 16 immune classes of HA (from H1 to H16) and 9 different NA classes (from N1 to N9). This provides the basis for the different influenza virus subtypes, like H9N2 or H5N1. Influenza viruses have two essential immunological characteristics that represent a real challenge to vaccine makers. First, genetic variations called \"antigenic drift\" occur in the surface glycoproteins every few years, producing viruses that escape to resistance elicited by commercialized vaccines (seasonal influenza). Second, the \"antigenic shift\" concerns the fact that influenza viruses can exchange genetic material and merge resulting new strains different from both parental viruses (influenza pandemic). This new influenza strain emerges and starts easily spreading. One example of an influenza pandemic is the \"Spanish flu\" (H1N1) pandemic in 1918 with more than 20 million people killed worldwide. Another example is the case of the avian influenza that has crossed the species barrier from birds to mammals, including humans, such that the human population would be immunologically pathogenic to this new strain. Nowadays, influenza has a critical importance for global public health. In this context, vaccination is the most effective solution for preventing infection and severe outbreaks caused by influenza viruses. Such a vaccine is composed with a whole but attenuated or killed virus or of a viral antigen such as the HA protein. The first efficient vaccine against influenza was developed in 1944 by Dr. Thomas Francis, Jr., with the funding of the American Army. Several vaccine preparations are now commercially available: study, a list of keywords was established: Keywords related to influenza virus: response, prevent, prevention, preventing, protect, protection, protecting. 4.1.3.2 Review of relevant classification codes By screening the international, European, American and Japanese patent classifications, the codes corresponding to medicinal preparations containing antigens or antibodies of influenza virus were collected. The following codes were thereby identified: International Patent Classification (IPC): A61K 39/145 424: Drug, bioaffecting and or immunospecific 424/ 209.1: influenza virus, fowl plague virus, etc.) 424/210.100 [0] 424: Drug, bioaffecting and body or immunospecific 424/ 209.1: influenza virus, fowl plague [4] 424/210.100: Subunit vaccine Derivatives Orthomyxoviridae, e.g. influenza virus 4.1.4. Search strategy 4.1.3.3 Classification codes based queries QUERY 1: Classification codes related to Orthomyxoviridae including influenza virus ((A61K039/145)/IC) OU ((424209100)/PCLO) OU classification means \"US patent classification \"ECLA\" means European classification \"FI\" means Japan File Index For further details of command lines, please refer to the appendix. This query led to 2397 FAMPAT families (published until November 2011). Under the IPC code A61K 039/145, the majority of patent families classified are related to influenza vaccines (e.g. US20080311153) including specific strains of the virus (e.g. RU2105063). However, the A61K039/145 IPC code is not dedicated to humans and includes patent families claiming influenza vaccines for animals like horses (e.g. WO0160849), dogs (e.g. WO200897970), pigs (e.g. JP59039831) and birds (e.g. RU2009114430). Furthermore, patent families claim vaccines against the other genera of the family of Orthomyxovirus like Isavirus (e.g. WO200072878). Other patent families do not correspond to influenza vaccinal element (antigen, viral strain) but to the global process of production of such vaccines, as the use of liposomes (e.g. WO9749423) or adjuvants (e.g. WO2009151313), the replication of viruses in cell culture (e.g. US20030119183), their purification (e.g. WO200806780), the frozen stockpiling of vaccines (e.g. WO200817956)... Other patent families are about detection of influenza virus (e.g. WO2007134166) because the IPC code also includes patent families protecting materials for immunoassay (G01N33/53). Patent families referring to diagnostic (e.g. SU1463758), to antibody against influenza virus (e.g. WO200378600) and antiviral peptide are also classified under the A61K039/145 IPC code. Furthermore, a lot of patent families did not refer to influenza virus but to Haemophilus influenza (e) (e.g. EP2133359) or Parainfluenza virus (e.g. US2007134271) that are not virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family. Some patent families claim vaccines against bacteria as Streptococcus equi (e.g. EP0786518). Patent families belong to results although they seem to be unrelated to Orthomyxovirus and influenza virus , probably because the keyword \"influenza\" is mentioned in claims (e.g. WO200172281). In conclusion, the A61K039/145 IPC code cannot be used to build a query mining influenza vaccines. The perimeter of search was thereby narrowed by eliminating patent families that do not deal with human influenza virus and completed by queries using keywords. 4.1.3.4 Keywordbased queries QUERY 2: Name of the influenza virus, the infectious disease and the virus family (in title, abstract and claims). (INFLUENZA+ OU FLU OU INFLUENZA_VIR+ OU ORTHO_MYXOVIR+ OU MYXOVIR+)/BI/CLMS \u00ab BI \u00bb means that the research is carried out in the titles and abstracts of FAMPAT families. \u00ab CLMS \u00bb means that the research is carried out in the claims of FAMPAT families. \u00ab _ \u00bb replace a space, a - or no space at all (i.e. ortho_mixoviridae can retrieve the words orthomixoviridae , ortho mixoviridae or orthomixoviridae ). For further details of command lines, please refer to the appendix. This query led to 20896 FAMPAT families. The results were related to influenza virus but not yet to vaccines (e.g. EP0007467) because many patents also claimed a treatment for influenza (e.g. ZA7905491), the detection of the virus (e.g. SU639941), a diagnostic test (e.g. SU1698288), a strain for modeling infection in mice (e.g. SU1735363), the replication of high growth virus strains in cell lines (e.g. US5824536) of their purification (e.g. EP0171086), an antiinfluenza virus agent from plant extracts (e.g. JP2002145790)... The influenza virus can also be quoted among a list of viruses in dependent claims (e.g. WO201056991) and one member of a family quotes the term \"influenza\" (e.g. WO200221614) or \"flu\" (e.g. US6378219) without link to the virus. Furthermore, patent families claimed Haemophilus influenzae (e.g. WO200216440) or Parainfluenza virus (e.g. US6410023), that should be eliminated with a specific query. The set of results was too noisy because of patent families not only related to influenza virus and/or vaccines. These irrelevant patent families had to be eliminated using specific queries. QUERY 3: Defined subtypes of influenza virus (in title, abstract and claims). ((H1N# OU H2N# OU H3N# OU H4N# \u00ab # \u00bb replaces strictly one character This query led to 1903 FAMPAT families. Most of these patent families were retrieved with Query 2 (e.g. RU2416641). For H1N#, H1 is the first of known types of the protein Hemagglutinin, associated with one of the known types of the protein Neuraminidase (N#). The exclusion of \"H2NR, H2NO and H2NH\" was a way to suppress irrelevant patent families (e.g. WO2008093086). However, some patent families did not refer to human influenza vaccines but to virus production (e.g. WO200745674), their detection (e.g. CN1858249)... QUERY 4: Undefined subtypes of influenza virus (in title, abstract and claims). ((H#N# OU A_H#N# OU B_H#N# OU B_H#N#)/BI/CLMS PHR (+MYXOVIR+ +VIRIDAE OU SEROTYPE? OU STRAIN? OU GL#COPROTEIN?

This query led to 1429 FAMPAT families. Most of these patent families were retrieved by the Queries 2 and 3 (e.g. RU2007127098). For H#N#, H# was one of the known types of the protein Hemagglutinin, associated with one the known types of the protein Neuraminidase (N#). The exclusion of \"HAND, HANG, HING, HTND, HSNI, HENO, HTNF and HANP\" was a way to suppress irrelevant patent families, as those claiming the use of restriction enzymes such as HIND III (that is fetch through H#N# keyword, e.g. WO2006085016). However, some patent families did not refer to human influenza vaccines as for the two precedent queries. QUERY 5: Names of the other genera of virus of the Orthomyxoviridae (in title, abstract and claims). (THOGOTO_VIRUS OU ISA_VIRUS)/BI/CLMS This query led to 20 FAMPAT families. These results would be eliminated of the study, as the patent family covering a vaccine against Isavirus (e.g. WO200072878). QUERY 6: Name of Haemophilus influenza (in claims). ((H?EMOPHILUS 1AV means \"up to one word before the other\". This query led to 2044 FAMPAT families. Haemophilus influenza , formerly called Bacillus influenza, is a bacteria of the Pasteurellaceae family and was considered until 1933 as the cause of influenza. The results dealt with Haemophilus influenza (e.g. WO02060938), Haemophilus influenzae (e.g. US20110150889) and Hemophilus influenza (e.g. WO8912460). This query was used in order to eliminate these irrelevant results from the queries related to influenza virus . QUERY 7: Name of Parainfluenza virus (in title, abstract and claims). (PARA_INFLUENZA)/BI/CLMS This query led to 1299 FAMPAT families. The Parainfluenza virus is a member of the Paramyxovirus family, and is different from the influenza virus. The review of these patent families highlighted many irrelevant results claiming for example recombinant parainfluenza virus vaccines (e.g. US6410023). This query was used in order to eliminate these results from the influenza queries. However, relevant patent families would also be eliminated with such a query because \"para influenza\" is a Spanish notion meaning \"for influenza\" (e.g. MX2011000459). But, these relevant results would be retrieved with complementary queries such as Spanish ones. QUERY 8: Elimination of the other genera of virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family, Haemophilus influenza and Parainfluenza virus . (QUERY 2 OR QUERY 3 OR QUERY 7) AND NOT (QUERY 5 OU QUERY 6 OU QUERY 7) This query led to 19252 FAMPAT families. At this stage, there was a mix of patent families quoting at least one of the keywords related to influenza virus and claiming vaccines and as well as diagnostic methods or therapeutic antibodies... It was therefore necessary to introduce a limitation to vaccines. QUERY 9: Combination of the Query 8 and a query including synonymous of vaccines to get patent families related to influenza vaccines (in title, abstract and claims). QUERY 8 ET (VACCIN+ OU IMMUNOGEN+ OU IMMUNIS+ OU IMMUNIZ+ OU ANTIGENIC)/BI/CLMS This query led to 3802 FAMPAT families. However, some patent families did not refer to influenza vaccines but to general vaccines, adjuvants, antiviral agents, inhibitors (e.g US20080181949)... and vaccines for animals (CA2535127). The next step was therefore to limit the results to human vaccines and a query was built to remove these irrelevant patent families. QUERY 10: Elimination of patent families claiming animals (in title, abstract and claims). QUERY 9 SAUF ((CHICKEN? OU FISH?? OU PIGEON? OU (NEWCASTLE DISEAS+) OU CATTLE OU AVIAN OU POULTRY OU (BURSAL DISEAS+) OU ANIMAL+ OU GOSLING OU GOOSE? CANID+ OU DOG? OU CAT? OU COW? OU FELINE OU PORCINE OU BIRD? OU EPIZOOTIC OU HOG? OU CALF OU BOVINE OU TURKEY? OU GOAT? OU SALMON? OU HORSE? OU OU VET) SAUF (HUMAN? OU PATIENT? OU MAN OU WOMAN OU MEN OU WOMEN OU ADULT? OU MAMMAL? OU CHILD OU CHILDREN OU BABY OU BABIES OU INFANT? OU SUBJECT? OU PEOPLE))/BI/CLMS This query led to 3097 FAMPAT families. At this stage, patent families claiming a veterinary use of the invention (e.g. WO9406468, US5916879) were eliminated, except those that also covered a human use (e.g. WO2007082734). The last residual patent families related to animals would be cleaned by an intellectual screening. However, some patent families did not refer to human influenza vaccines but to the virus production (e.g. WO200745674), their detection (e.g. CN1858249)... The next step consisted therefore in limiting the results to patent families claiming the vaccines themselves and not the purification process, the cell culture of viruses... For this purpose, these irrelevant patent families were suppressed with queries of keywords not related to vaccines that were built for the study about vaccines in general (Part I). All Queries from Query 11 to Query 23 were therefore used to suppress irrelevant patent families. QUERY 11: (((BIOREACTOR+ OU REACTOR+ OU INDUSTRIAL OU (LARGE SCALE) OU (MASS PRODUCTION))/TI) OU (((BIOREACTOR+ OU REACTOR+)/AB) XENOGRAFT+ OU NEEDLE+ MICRONEEDLE+ PEN OU POWDER+ OU QUERY 18: (CROHN OU ALZHEIMER OU (IMMUNE DISEASE?) OU (AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE) OU 19: (DELIVER+ PAPILLOMA TUBERCULOSIS ANTHRAX OU INFLUENZA+ OU FLU OU EPSTEIN OU ANGUILLARUM OU VACCIN+))/TI/AB/CLMS)) OU ((STABILI+ ET (FORMULATION PEPTID+)))/TI/AB/CLMS QUERY 24: QUERY 10 SAUF (QUERY 11 OU QUERY 12 OU QUERY 13 OU QUERY 14 OU QUERY 15 OU QUERY 16 OU QUERY 17 OU QUERY 18 OU QUERY 19 OU QUERY 20 OU QUERY 21 OU QUERY 22 OU QUERY 23) This query led to 2324 FAMPAT families. At this stage, irrelevant patent families were still present in the dataset. To eliminate them, the Query 25 was built with the suppression of recurrent terms (purif+, inhitor?...) related to results about influenza virus inhibitors, virus purification... QUERY 25: QUERY 24 SAUF ((PURIF+ OU +ASSAY+ OU ANTIBOD+ OU DETECT+ OU MENINGITIS ANKARA OU MALARIAL? OU ANTIVIRAL OU BACULO+ OU MURAMYL OU OU OU (A61P035+)/IC) This query led to 1379 FAMPAT families. An intellectual screening allowed checking the results of the Query 25 to decide if they had to be conserved in a list (e.g. RU2422517) or eliminated (KR20110072473). For this purpose, the title, abstract and claims of the 1379 results were manually analyzed. Such a detailed review allowed the identification of new keywords to validate the previous queries or build new ones, as well as the identification of irrelevant patent families to suppress them. QUERY 26: Supplemental search concerning immune response (INFLUENZA+ OU FLU OU INFLUENZA_VIR+ OU ORTHO_MYXOVIR+ OU MYXOVIR+)/BI/CLMS PHR RESPONSE?)/BI/CLMS This query led to 2318 FAMPAT families. This query completed the relevant patent families of the Query 9 (keywords related to vaccines) with additional relevant results (e.g. WO2008054540). The new relevant results of this query were added in the list of selected patent families. QUERY 27: Supplemental search concerning nonnatural virus (INFLUENZA+ OU FLU OU ORTHO_MYXOVIR+ OU MYXOVIR+)/BI/CLMS PHR (ATTENUAT+ OU INACTIVAT+ OU KILLED OU LIVE OU VIRULENT OU AVIRULENT)/BI/CLMS This query led to 1014 FAMPAT families. Most of them were already identified with previous queries (e.g. KR20080100632). The new relevant results of this query are added in the list of selected patent families. QUERY 28: Supplemental search concerning viruslike particles (INFLUENZA+ OU FLU ET ((+LIKE PHR PARTICLE?) OU VLP?)/BI/CLMSoffice of first filings This query led to 383 FAMPAT families. The viruslike particles (VLPs) can induce an immune response since they include at least surface proteins displayed in a conformation similar enough to their native conformation. Moreover, these particles do not contain the complement of the genetic material required to the viral replication. Most of patent claiming VLPs were already identified with previous queries (e.g. WO2009105729) but new relevant patent families were identified (e.g. WO200200885) with this additional query. They were therefore added to the list of selected patent families. QUERY 29: Supplemental search concerning virosomes VIROSOME?/BI/CLMS This query led to 215 FAMPAT families. Most of them were already identified with previous queries (e.g. WO2007107585). The new relevant results of this query were added to the list of selected patent families (e.g. US5879685, not included in the results of the Query 25). Another investigation was conducted, adding new keywords related to the structure of influenza virus that was similar in composition for the viral particles of all influenza viruses. The virus structure is made of a viral envelope containing two main types of glycoproteins on the outside of the viral particles: Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA). QUERY 30: ((H?EMAGGLUTININ? OU (HA AV (PROTEIN? OU GENE? OU SEQUENCE?)) (NA AV (PROTEIN? OU ANTIGENIC))/BI/CLMS This query led to 1355 FAMPAT families. The results mainly concerned the immune response elicited by the viral protein Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA). Most of them were already identified with previous queries (e.g. WO2010125202). An intellectual screening was the way to eliminate Neuraminidase not related to influenza virus (but to Pasteurella multocida , e.g. WO9816649). The new relevant results of this query were added to the list of selected patent families (e.g. CN1660421, not included in the results of the Query 25). QUERY 31: Query in foreign language: French, Spanish, German, Russian, Japanese, Chinese and Korean. French = \"GRIPPE\"means \"influenza\" and \"VACCIN?\" means \"vaccine(s)\". Spanish = \"IMPFSTOFF?\" means \"vaccine(s)\". Russian = \" \"means \"influenza\" and \" \" means \"vaccine(s)\". Japanese = \" \"means \"influenza\" and \" \" means \"vaccine(s)\". Chinese = \" \"means \"influenza\" and \" \" means \"vaccine(s)\". Korean = \" \"means \"influenza\" and \" \" means \"vaccine(s)\". (GRIPPE ET VACCIN?)/BI/CLMS (INFLUENZA ET VACUNA?)/BI/CLMS ET )/BI/CLMS OU ( ET )/BI/CLMS This query led to 1470 FAMPAT families. This query combined non English terms such as French (FR), Spanish (ES), German (DE), Russian (RU), Japanese (JP), Chinese (CN) and Korean (KR). Such a detailed study allowed the identification of further relevant patent families related to influenza vaccines, as well as patent families to be eliminated. Several relevant results (e.g. CL10702008) were thus added to the list of selected patent families. These patents were not retrieved by former English queries because of mistakes in the automatic English machine translation. 4.1.3.5 Consistency analysis of the patent pool The citation analysis of the patent pool led to a list of the most cited patents. The most cited patents were either already in our patent pool or outside. The patent families that were not included in the pool were checked and did not lead to the identification of further relevant patent families. This confirms that the search strategy does not need further refinement with complementary keywords or IPC codes, or else. 4.1.3.6 Refinement of the patent pool and final database A total of 79 INPADOC patent families needed a review by technical experts in order to determine their relevancy. These 79 potentially relevant INPADOC patent families identified were reviewed in collaboration with the WIPO and WHO in order to validate (e.g. WO11014794) or eliminate (e.g. WO06045532) them from the final database. The final database on human influenza vaccines, created 18th November 2011, contains 516 relevant INPADOC patent families (45 INPADOC patent families were excluded through this second manual review) . 4.2. Statistical analysis 4.2.1. Number and evolution of patent filings and grants Total number of patent families claiming active ingredients of human influenza vaccines 516 Total different patents & patent applications 2226 Average INPADOC Family Size 4.31 patents or applications/family Granted patents 38.3% PCT applications 53.7% Table 28 - General statistics of patent filings and grants The patent search resulted in 516 families of patents and patent applications published until November 2011. These 516 patent families include 2226 patents or published applications. Among these 516 patent families, 198 included one or more granted patents. These patent families contained two \"Complex Patent Families\" (CPF): One claiming the U.S Provisional application 60/303,396 filed July 9, 2001 as first filing (6 patent families out of 56 patent families of this CPF were included in this database) (filed by BOGOCH ELENORE; BOGOCH SAMUEL) One claiming the GB20070007697 filed April 4, 2007 as first filing (2 patent families out of the 44 patent families of this CPF were included in this database) (filed by GLAXO SMITHKLINE BIOLOGICALS) For more information on how families are built, please refer to WIPO standards references on Patent Family14 or other references on the Internet 15 Granted patents were identified by creating a query based on kind codes related to granted patents of all patenting authorities and applying it to the patent pool of active ingredients of human pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Each patenting office has its own kind code system. For example, publications of the European Patent Office having a \"B\" kind code are granted patents, whereas publications having an \"A1, A2, A3\" kind code are applications. For the US Patent and Trademark Office, publications with an \"A\" kind code published before November 2000 and publications with kind code \"B1, B2\" are granted patent while publications with an \"A1, A2\" kind code published after November 2000 are applications. Families having granted family members do not necessarily mean that protection has entered into force or that the patent is still valid. Granted patents may not be in force for several reasons including that the patent term expired, that fees have not been paid, or that it did not survive opposition or revocation procedures. The figure below describes patenting activity over time and gives a view of patent grant rate in the field of active ingredients of human influenza vaccines. The graph represents the number of patent families (Y axis) over the year of first filing (X axis). This year (priority year) was chosen rather than the publication year, as this is more indicative of patenting activities since they are less dependent on the varying publication policies and docket backlogs of patent offices. The count of families for each year of first filing is split into two fractions according to whether families included at least one granted patent or not. The graph shows a rather steady number of filings until 2002 (~10 filings a year) and a strong increase in the filings as of 2004 (to reach over 60 filings in 2009). A deeper analysis might confirm that this strong patenting activity was due to the bird flu pandemics that had been spreading throughout Asia since 2003, Europe in 2005, and the Middle East, as well as Africa, the following year. The high risk of transmission to humans pushed scientists to develop vaccines against new strains of influenza viruses. The small fraction of grants in younger families reflects the pendency of patent issue, i.e. the time between the filing of an application and the grant of a patent which varies from a patent office to another and can last for several years (e.g. about 4 years for patents issued by EPO).. 14 http://www.wipo.int/standards/en/pdf/08 0101.pdf 15 http://www.intellogist.c om/wiki/Patent_Families In the 1990s, more than 60% of patent families contained at least one granted patent while, since 2001, this rate has not exceeded 50%. The small fraction of grants in younger families (since 2005) reflects the pendency of patent issue, i.e. the time between the filing of an application and the grant of a patent which varies from a patent office to another and can last for several years (e.g. about 4 years for patents issued by EPO). For these families the examination of family members may still be pending or may not be requested yet. For earlier years of filing, national publication policies and the evolution of national patent legislation have to be taken into account. For example, until November 2000, the US patent office published only granted US patents. Thereby, US applications that were not granted were in fact never published. For the coverage of national databases used in this study, please refer to corresponding appendix. In addition, because of the 18 months of publication delay after the date of patent filing, the data after 2009 are incomplete. Figure 39 - Evolution of the number of patent families and without grants per year of first filing Starting 1991, PCT applications were widely used to reach more than 70% of patent families. Figure 40 - Evolution of the number of patent families and without PCT applications per year of first filing The table below lists the office of origin of all PCT applications. This table was established by looking at the application number of a PCT filing that mentions the office of origin of the PCT (e.g. 2008WO FR00687, this PCT application was filed via the French patent office).

Location of first filings An analysis of the place of filing of priority patents results in the following table. A map of these filings can be seen in appendix. The location of priority filings and their evolution may give an indication of the country of origin of applicants and the dynamic of innovation in these countries. The United States (that registered the first known patent application dealing with active ingredients of vaccines against human influenza) and Russia largely dominate as Office of first filing making this mapping the only \"cold war\"like mapping analyzed through this study. The United Kingdom, Japan and recently China are playing runners up. 113 113 41 60 61 62 63 64 65 6 667 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 0 607 08 09 10 11 TOTA L PCT WORLD 1 1 11111 7 UNITED STATES 1 111 1 121 12 312 1 2335512133533 10916 31 28 26 39 10 227 CANADA 2 2 MEXICO 11 2 CUBA 1 1 EUROPE 1 21 3 2 111 44 20 UNITED KINGDOM 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 113 12131 233412 36 FRANCE 1 1 12 11 1 1 1 1 11 GERMANY 11 1 11 5 IRELAND 11 1 1 4 FINLAND 21 1 4 AUSTRIA 11 1 3 HUNGARY 1 1 2 ITALY 11 2 DENMARK 11 2 SWITZERLAND 1 1 BULGARIA 1 1 SWEDEN 1 1 NETHERLANDS 1 1 SPAIN 1 1 RUSSIAN FEDERATION 1 213214 1 42154 93 3243 222523 35 79 KAZAKHSTAN 2 2 CHINA 1 1372319683 44 JAPAN 1 111311 2 1223313 26 KOREA 2 21 1 2 1122 14 INDIA 1 11 3 TAIWAN 1 1 MIDDLE EAST ISRAE L 11 1 1 1 1 6 AFRICA SOUTH AFRICA 1 1 AUSTRALIA AUSTRALIA 21 3 1100002430111243212544536222646 1 3 1 0 8 1 7 1 0 57 1 1 1 4 1 6 9 1 2 1 7 2 5 3 1 4 9 4 8 4 0 6 6 2 4 3 5 1 2AMERICA EUROPE EURASIA ASIA Total Table 30 - Evolution of first filings by offices Vaccines for selected infectious diseases2012 11 4114 In order to have a better understanding of the country of origin and the innovation dynamic in these countries, it is more appropriate to take a look at the number of filings according to inventors' place of residence rather than the office of first filing. To be able to make these statistics, the data related to Inventor's country (extracted from the address of the inventor), indexed in FamPat database (QuestelTM), was used. To do this, patent families of the database \"Active Ingredients of human pneumococcal vaccines\" were loaded into FamPat. This did not change the number of retrieved patent families although the definition of FamPat families is a little different from INPADOC families (FAMPAT families are built with patent applications having exactly the same priority whereas INPADOC families are built with patent applications having at least one priority patent application in common). Then, the number of filings naming at least one inventor coming from a country in particular was then counted. It should be noted that totals of the two categories of the table are different because the inventors indicated in an individual patent application may have different countries of residence; each country was counted once, e.g. an application with two inventors residing in Belgium and one inventor residing in the United Kingdom would result in one count for each country. It can thus be noted that innovation created by Canadian inventors tends to be first protected through the US patent office and that Italian, Dutch, German, Austrian and Belgium innovation tends to be first protected through UK or EP patent offices. Several reasons can coexist to explain these differences: The interest in specific cases to use US provisional patents (even when the innovation do not stems from US inventors) The difference in location of patent officers and research team. For example, 19 applications filed by Belgian inventors but no filing registered at the Belgian patent office. This is explained by the fact that GSK vaccine research team is located in Belgium but files in the United Kingdom where are located the headquarters. On the same way, NOVARTIS/CHIRON research team is located in Italy but files in the United Kingdom. The interest of filing directly in English to lessen future translation fees Vaccines for selected infectious diseases2012 11 5115 Number of filings in each patent authorityNumber of filings according to inventors' place of residence PCT WORLD 7 / UNITED STATES 227 173 CANADA 2 22 MEXICO 2 3 CUBA 1 1 EUROPE 20 / GERMAN Y 52 5 UNITED KINGDOM 36 24 BELGIUM / 19 AUSTRIA 3 16 FRANCE 11 15 NETHERLANDS 1 14 ITALY 21 3 SWITZERLAND 1 7 SWEDEN 1 6 FINLAND 4 4 DENMARK 2 3 SPAIN 1 2 BULGARIA 1 1 HUNGARY 2 1 LATVIA / 1 SLOVAKIA / 1 ROMANIA / 1 IRELAND 4 / RUSSIAN FEDERATION 79 66 KAZAKHSTAN 2 2 UKRAINE / 1 CHINA 44 42 JAPAN 26 23 KOREA 14 16 INDIA 3 5 SINGAPORE / 4 THAILAND / 1 TAIWAN 1 / MIDDLE EAST ISRAEL 6 11 SUDAN / 1 SOUTH AFRICA 1 / AUSTRALIA 3 12 NEW ZEALAND / 2 512 538AMERICA EUROPE EURASIA ASIA TotalOCEANIAAFRICA Table 31 - Comparison between place of filings and origin of the inventors Vaccines for selected infectious diseases2012 11 6116 4.2.3. Average family size per office of first filing These data were established by looking at the publication numbers of each family in order to extract the number of offices in which the applications were filed. However, for patent and patent applications of European countries filed via the European Procedure, a different counting was carried out because of specificities of European procedures. According to the designated and chosen offices, a new patent application number is attributed by these offices or not. For instance, German patent office will deliver a number (DE123456) after an extension via the European procedure while France will use the EP number (EP654321). When looking at the patent families via the patent & patent application numbers, it therefore created, improperly, a higher number of German extensions compared to French ones. Consequently, when a patent family contained a patent application filed via the EPO, the numbers issued by the selected offices (during the national phases) were not recorded. These numbers were counted only if no EP filing was part of the family. In addition, only one document per office was taken into account when calculating the family size in order not to count twice the patent application and the issued patent. Office of first filing Average family size Standard deviation AUSTRIA (AT) 7.3 2.1 AUSTRALIA (AU) 1.3 0.6 BULGARIA (BG) 1.0 CANADA (CA) 2.0 1.4 SWITZERLAND (CH) 25.0 CHINA (CN) 1.0 0.3 CUBA (CU) 13.0 GERMANY (DE) 4.8 4.0 DENMARK (DK) 4.5 0.7 EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE (EP) 7.0 4.5 SPAIN (ES) 2.0 FINLAND (FI) 3.8 2.4 FRANCE (FR) 8.5 5.4 UNITED KINGDOM (GB) 7.9 5.6 HUNGARY (HU) 1.0 IRELAND (IE) 1.0 ISRAEL (IL) 2.8 3.1 INDIA (IN) 5.0 5.3 ITALY (IT) 1.0 JAPAN (JP) 3.3 4.1 KOREA (KR) 1.5 0.9 KAZAKHSTAN (KZ) 2.0 MEXICO (MX) 1.5 0.7 NETHERLANDS (NL) 10.0 RUSSIA (RU) 1.2 1.3 SWEDEN (SE) 3.0 Vaccines for selected infectious diseases2012 11 7117 Office of first filing Average family size Standard deviation TAIWAN (TW) 2.0 UNITED STATES (US) 5.4 4.4 INTERNATIONAL BUREAU (WO) 5.6 5.7 SOUTH AFRICA (ZA) 4.0 Table 32 - Average family size and standard deviation per office of first filing It can be noted that Russian, Chinese and Korean patent families were almost never extended while US, Japanese and European patent families are divided in two main groups: those that were never extended and those with a high number of extension (~12) which lead to an average family size of medium value but a high standard deviation. 4.2.4. Location of second filings An analysis of the location of second filings results in the following histogram. A map compiling these data can be found in the corresponding appendix. Countries chosen for the extension of priority filings are an indicator of the markets and/or the production sites. The choice of countries may also be guided by company's competitors and potential infringers, even if there is no market in these corresponding territories. In Life Sciences, the choice can also be guided by usual locations of clinical trials (Poland, Hungary, Thailand, India...). These data were established by looking at the patent numbers of each family without taking into account the number delivered by the office of first filing (see previous section for the explanation of the calculation). Figure 41 - Number of applications in th e offices of second filings Vaccines for selected infectious diseases2012 11 8118 Many second filings were performed via the PCT procedure (as seen in the previous section it represents 68% of the patent applications). Canada, the European patent office (EPO), Australia, Japan and China also dominate as offices of second filings. Beware that the importance of Australia must be understood in relation to the policy of the Australian patent office which automatically delivered an Australian patent number when the PCT mentions Australia even if no extension were filed in Australia during the national phase. 4.2.5.

Analysis of applicants Two types of applicants can be distinguished: institutional and industrial ones. The evolution of institutional vs. industrial priority filings (figure below) outlines the strong presence of institutional filings and the increasing number of industrial ones. Since 2003, It can be noted the emergence of co filings between institutional and industrial applicants. Vaccines for selected infectious diseases2012 12 1121 Figure 43 - Number of Institutional/Industrial/Individua l priority filings per year of first filing The following graph shows the main applicants classified by the size of their patent portfolio. Cofilings are counted for each coowner. For instance, a patent application cofiled between US Government and GSK is counted once for US Government and once for GSK. Figure 44 - List of main applicants ( 4 patent or patent applications) INDUSTRIAL APPLICANTS INSTITUTIONAL APPLICANTS Vaccines for selected infectious diseases2012 12 2122 The Russian scientific research institutions dominate in terms of number of filings outnumbering the US Government laboratories and the University of Wisconsin institutional filings. GSK, Novartis, Astrazeneca, Pfizer, SanofiAventis and to a lesser extent Merck&Co hold a significant position. Please note that affiliates/subsidiaries were gathered under their parent company. These groupings were performed via a homemade database of mother companies and subsidiaries developed with Elsevier's business intelligence database16, companies' websites, annual reports, business intelligence reviews and websites...

The following graph details the evolution of office of first filing by applicant. The year corresponds to the first priority year of the patent family. Such a graph allows the identification of pioneer or emerging applicants in terms of filings. Figure 47 - Evolution of main applicants' filings (by year of first filing) The University of Pennsylvania that was the first applicant to file a patent application about human influenza vaccines seems to have left the field a long time before filing again as of 2006. Among the most active applicants, the Russian scientific research institutes have had a strong and continuous activity since 1979 and all over the period. To a lesser extend, GSK have had also a continuous activity since the middle of the 1960s. Some other applicants, such as the US Government laboratories, Novartis, Sinai school of medicine or AstraZeneca, filed some patent applications before the 2000s but emerged in terms of filings only recently. In contrast, some players, such as Daiichi Sankyo might have stopped research on human influenza vaccines because no more patent applications have been filed since 1993. The following table details the average family size by applicant. Please note that, because of the particular numbering of patent applications filed during the national phase of the European procedure (see section 4.2.3. for the detailed explanation), when a patent family contained a patent application filed via the EPO, the numbers delivered by the selected offices (during the national Vaccines for selected infectious diseases2012 12 6126 phases) were not recorded. These numbers were counted only if no EP filing was part of the family. In addition, only one document per office was taken into account when calculating the family size in order not to count twice the patent application and the issued patent.

Vaccines for selected infectious diseases2012 13 4134 Appendix 1: Terminology Patent family: all the documents having at least one priority in common belong to the same INPADOC patent family and strictly the same priority belong to the same FAMPAT patent family. INPADOC is an acronym for International Patent Documentation Center. INPADOC is an international patent collection founded by WIPO but produced and maintained by the European Patent Office. FAMPAT is a patent database created by Questel. Patent publication: patent applications are generally published 18 months after the earliest priority date of the application. Prior to that publication, the application is confidential. After publication, depending upon local rules, certain parts of the application file may remain confidential, but it is common for all communications between an Applicant (or his agent) and the patent office to be publicly available. Office of first filing (OFF): it is the country where the first patent application (the earlier priority) was filed. Office of second filing (OSF): it is the offices where subsequent family members of a patent were filed. Continuation: a continuation application is a patent application filed by an applicant who wants to pursue additional claims to an invention disclosed in an earlier application of the applicant that has not yet been issued or abandoned. It is claiming priority based on the filing date of the parent application. Continuation inpart: a continuation inpart application is a patent application that repeats substantional portion of an invention disclosed in an earlier application and adds subject matter not disclosed in this parent application. It is claiming priority based on the filing date of the parent application. Divisional: A divisional patent application is a patent application which contains matter from an earlier application but claims a distinct or independent invention extracted from the parent application. Divisional applications are generally used in cases where the parent application may lack unity of invention (i.e. parent application describes more than one invention) and the applicant is required to split the parent into one or more divisional applications each claiming only a single invention. A divisional application is retaining its parent's filing date and is generally claiming the same priority. Granting: the procedure for granting patents varies widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. However, a patent application always includes one or more claims defining the invention which must be new, inventive and industrially applicable. PCT (WO): the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) is an international patent law treaty concluded in 1970. Any contracting state to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (1883) can become a member of the PCT. It provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an international application, PCT application. Vaccines for selected infectious diseases2012 13 5135 European patent (EP): the Convention on the Grant of European Patents signed October 5, 1973, commonly known as the European Patent Convention (EPC) and sometimes known as the Munich Convention, is a multilateral treaty instituting the European Patent Organisation (EPO) and providing an autonomous legal system according to which European patents are granted. The term European patent is used to refer to patents granted under the European Patent Convention. However, after granting, a European patent is not a unitary right, but a group of essentially independent nationally enforceable patents. Eurasian patent (EA): The Eurasian Patent Organization (EAPO) set up by the Eurasian Patent Convention (EAPC) was signed and ratified by nine countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan) in 1994 and came into force in 1995. The Convention allows the filing of one patent application in the Russian language with an automatic designation of all Member States. After the grant of a Eurasian Patent, the patentee shall indicate in which Member States he desires to maintain the patent. ARIPO (AP): ARIPO is the African Regional Industrial Property Organization for Englishspeaking Africa. The Agreement between the member countries (Botswana, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia (from 24 March 2010), Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) was signed on December 9, 1976. A protection can alternatively be obtained on an individual basis in any of these countries via a national application in such country. OAPI (OA): OAPI is the African Intellectual Property Organization for Frenchspeaking Africa. The Agreement between the member countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) was signed on September 13, 1962. It is not possible to obtain protection in any of these countries other than by way of an OAPI application. Vaccines for selected infectious diseases2012 13 6136 Appendix 2: Previous Patent Landscape Reports on vaccines & Links A background study was performed in order to collect publicly available patent studies that already existed on vaccines against infectious diseases, as well as articles and presentations. These studies were used to collect information (such as useful keywords to build patent queries) before starting this patent landscape.

A61K39/02 OR A61K39/04 OR A61K39/1* OR A61K39/2*) 5032 results As mentioned in the search strategy introduction, the combination of these queries built with classification codes created the pool 1. QUERY 5: combination of classification codes based queries query 1 OR query 2 OR query 3 OR query 4 Pool 1=28299 results 2. Keyword-based query - Pool 1 To understand the query language, please refer to appendices. QUERY 6: query used to clean the pool 1 TAC=(vaccine% OR vaccin% OR vaccina* OR vacina* OR FT=( ) These results were crossed with pool 1 in order to eliminate all patents and patent applications that clearly do not deal with vaccines and obtain pool 2 QUERY 7: pool 2 query 5 AND query 6 Pool 2=22745 results 3. Keyword-based query - Pool 2A To obtain pool 2A, pool 2 was crossed with high relevant keywordbased queries. Many keywords were tested to build the following queries of keywords that retrieve a high percentage of relevant patents and patent applications. QUERY 8: TAC=((immunis* OR immuniz*) WF1 12: TA=((attenuat* OR inactivat* OR killed OR live OR virulent OR avirulent) AND (Strain% OR *virus OR bacter* OR for) OR (vaccine adjuvants) OR dose OR intranasal OR somatostatin OR cream OR QUERY OR immunis*) W5 against) These queries of highly relevant keywords were combined (query 18) and then crossed with pool 2 to obtain pool 2A (query 19) QUERY 18: combination of high relevant keywordbased queries query 8 OR query 9 OR query 10 OR query 11 OR query 12 OR query 13 OR query 14 OR query 15 OR query 16 OR query 17 51608 results QUERY 19: pool 2A query 7 AND query 18 Pool 2A=11276 results Then pool 2A (containing 11276 patents and patent applications) was cleaned with queries of keywords containing combinations of typical irrelevant keywords to obtain the first group of relevant patents and patent applications. Many keywords were tested to build the following typical irrelevant queries of keywords that cleaned pool 2A.

Keyword-based query - Pool 2B To obtain pool 2B, pool 2A was removed from pool 2. Then, an iteration of queries of keywords that alternatively retrieved relevant documents or eliminated irrelevant ones were implemented, decreasing progressively the number of remaining documents to analyze in pool 2B. Gradually, these steps led to a new group of relevant patents and patent applications. QUERY 37: pool 2B query 7 AND NOT query 18 11474 results remaining to analyze Pool 2B (containing 11474 patents and patent applications) was first cleaned with the keyword search queries containing combinations of irrelevant keywords (query 38) QUERY 38: iteration 1 - elimination of irrelevant patents and patent applications using the typical irrelevant queries of keywords query 37 AND NOT query 35 9058 results remaining to analyze After this step and for the next steps of the iteration process, relevant queries of keywords (that should only retrieve relevant patents and patent applications) retrieved also irrelevant patents and patent applications. These irrelevant patents and patent applications were identified by intellectual screening and then saved in a folder in order to remove them easily (folder \"irrelevant patents\"). To simplify the presentation of the present search strategy, this pool of irrelevant INPADOC patent families was removed at the next step (query 39). QUERY 39: iteration 2 - elimination of folder \"irrelevant patents\" query 38 AND NOT folder \"irrelevant patents\" 8594 results remaining to be analyzed QUERY 40: iteration 3 - recovery of a first group of relevant patents and patent applications query 39 AND TAC=(prevent* WF9 infect*) AND TA=(vaccine* OR antigen* OR immunogen*) 335 relevant families identified and removed from the query 39 8259 results remaining to be analyzed QUERY 41: iteration 4 - recovery of a second group of relevant patents and patent applications query 40 AND TA=((vaccine* composition*) OR (immunogenic* composition*)) AND TAC=((prevent* OR protect*) WF9 infect*) 21 relevant families identified and removed from the query 40 8238 results remaining to be analyzed QUERY 42: iteration 5 - recovery of a third group of relevant patents and patent applications query 41 AND TA=(elicit* OR generat* OR induc* OR trigger*) W5 (re%ponse*) 66 relevant families identified and removed from the query 41 8172 results remaining to be analyzed For the next step, in order to simplify the presentation, iteration steps that could be grouped were presented in the same query (query 43, query 44 and query 45). QUERY 43: iteration 6 - elimination of irrelevant patent families using a series of irrelevant queries of keywords presented below TI=(assay% OR immunoassay% OR microassay%) antineoplas* neoplas*) antitumor* OR (anti tumor*) OR antitumour* OR (anti tumour*) OR obesity OR healing) AND NOT (HPV OR papilloma*) query 42 AND NOT series of irrelevant keywordbased queries presented above 5618 results remaining to be analyzed QUERY 44: iteration 7 - recovery of a fourth group of relevant patent families using a set of relevant queries of keywords presented below TAC=(elicit* OR generat* OR OR antigen%) AND (vaccin* OR immuniz* OR immunis*))) query 42 AND NOT series of relevant keywordbased queries presented above 1624 relevant families identified and removed from the query 43 3994 results remaining to be analyzed QUERY 45: iteration 8 - elimination of irrelevant patent families using a new series of irrelevant keywordbased queries presented below TAC=monoclonal TI=antibod* TA=antibod* AND NOT TI=(immunogenic immunization prophyla* OR vaccino*) OR vaccino*) TI=(medicament% OR medecine% OR compound%) query 44 AND NOT series of irrelevant keywordbased queries presented above 2883 results remaining to be analyzed QUERY 46: iteration 9 - recovery of a fifth group of relevant patents and patent applications query 45 AND TAC=((stimulat*) WF5 (immune re%ponse*)) AND NOT (treat* OR therap*) 14 relevant families identified and removed from the query 45 2869 results remaining to be analyzed QUERY 47: iteration 10 - elimination of irrelevant patent families query 46 AND NOT TA=(treat* OR therap*) AND NOT TAC=(vaccin* AND immuniz* OR immunis* OR immunogenic)) 2255 results remaining to be analyzed QUERY 48: iteration 11 - recovery of a sixth group of relevant patents and patent applications query 47 AND TA=(immunogenic WF1 influenza) 2 relevant families identified and removed from the query 47 2253 results remaining to be analyzed At this stage no further keywordbased queries were sufficiently helpful to eliminate or retrieve irrelevant or relevant patent families. A deep review was performed on a sample of the patent families remaining to analyze in order to estimate the percentage of relevant patent families present. As this percentage was inferior to 10%, it was decided in accordance with the WIPO to eliminate the whole pool of remaining patent families. This concluded the iteration process concerning pool 2B. A second group of 2062 relevant patents and patent applications was validated 5. Investigations to valida te the search strategy Other IPC codes were investigated to confirm and validate the fact that only a tiny fraction of the relevant patents and patent applications were not classified within the classification codes selected. As IPC codes cover the major part of patents and patent applications comparing to other type of classification codes, the next steps were only performed using IPC codes. By screening the IPC classification, it appeared that the main group C07K14 gathered patent families claiming peptides. As antigens are mostly from peptide origin, it was decided to investigate this major group. However, this classification does not only cover patents claiming vaccine applications; these classification codes had therefore to be combined with other IPC codes (or keywords) such as A61P31 or A61P33 that are related to potential vaccine application. These IPC codes are presented below. International Patent Classification (IPC): Selection of subclasses of subgroup C07K14 corresponding to peptides having more than 20 amino acids specific to infectious diseases Examples of selected subclasses of subgroup C07K14: C07K 14/005 and their respective subclasses Note that these IPC codes are related to infectious diseases but despite their combination are still not fully specific to vaccines (there are still patents claiming therapeutic peptides, immunomodulators ...) QUERY 49: Other IPC codes AND (IC=(A61P31 OR A61P33)) 5778 results From these results were removed all the results retrieved through by the classification codes selected and already analyzed (query 5). QUERY 50: Other IPC codes investigated without the classification codes already analyzed query 49 AND NOT query 5 1279 results Then, this result was crossed with the combination of queries of high relevant keywords (query 18) and cleaned with the combination of queries of irrelevant keywords (query 35) in order to highlight the potentially relevant patent families. QUERY 51: Other IPC codes investigated - potential relevant patent pool (query 50 AND query 18) AND NOT query 35 77 results This result shows that very few relevant patents and patent applications were not retrieved by the first selection of classification codes (query 5). Although the volume of relevant patents and patent applications retrieved through the other IPC codes investigated was not representative comparing to the volume of the global database, these patent families were included in the final database. This analysis therefore confirmed and validated the formerly set up search strategy. 6. Final database The final database on vaccines against infectious diseases, created 23rd November 2011, contained 11818 relevant INPADOC patent families.
