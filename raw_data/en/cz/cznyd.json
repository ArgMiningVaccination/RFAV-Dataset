Mind-body medicine is an approach to healthcare that recognizes the interconnectedness of the mind and body and seeks to address health and wellness from a holistic perspective. It includes a variety of practices such as meditation, relaxation techniques, and cognitive-behavioral therapy, among others. [Dr. Sarno Approach](https://www.sarnoclinic.com/what-is-the-dr-sarno-method/) Dr. John E. Sarno was a pioneer in the field of mind-body medicine and developed an approach to treating chronic pain that has helped many people find relief from their symptoms. Sarno's approach emphasizes the role that psychological factors play in the development and maintenance of chronic pain conditions. According to Sarno, many chronic pain conditions are not caused by structural abnormalities in the body, but rather by repressed emotions such as anger, fear, and anxiety. He believed that the mind and body are closely linked and that emotional tension can manifest as physical symptoms such as back pain, neck pain, fibromyalgia and other chronic pain conditions. Sarno's approach involves helping patients to identify and work through the underlying emotional issues that may be contributing to their pain.
