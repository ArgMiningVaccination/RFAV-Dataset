There are no contraindications to the use of Echinaforce\u00ae either before or after the flu vaccination. Even if you've had the flu vaccine, it's still advisable to use Echinaforce daily because the vaccine does not protect you from cold viruses. Most winter infections are due to colds. 2. How do I know if I have a cold or the flu? It can sometimes be difficult to tell. Flu (or influenza) produces similar symptoms to the common cold but these are usually more severe. In addition, you may experience fever, sweats and muscle aches. 3. I already have a cold /flu / sore throat...is it too late for me to start using Echinaforce\u00ae? Not at all, just increase the dosage until your symptoms subside by taking 2 tablets 3-5 times a day before meals, or 20 drops 3-5 times a day in a little water and once your symptoms subside, return to the daily dosage in point 1. 4.

Patients who suffer from any form of auto-immune disease or those on immuno-suppressant medication must please consult their healthcare practitioner before using Echinaforce\u00ae. 6.

Excellent. It really works as it prevents it getting worse.\" Jen Marsh \"I have been using this product for many years and it has never let me down. As soon as I feel slightly under the weather, generally when I know a cold or worse is coming on, I immediately take and keep taking echinacea drops over an extended period. Generally it backs the symptoms right away and, if not, it relieves the worst the cold or flu can throw at me. Yes, I'm convinced that it does boost the immune system in the longer term.\" Alexander Mckinven \"I take 15 drops of this every night and have not had a chest infection (which I previously got every 2-4 months) for over a year.\" Debra Cooper "}
