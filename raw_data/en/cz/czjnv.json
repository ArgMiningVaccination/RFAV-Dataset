Methods: A cross-sectional survey was administered to community-dwelling adults between the ages of 46 and 75 years, and a total of 351 participants completed the questionnaire. Log-binominal regression analyses were fitted to explore the factors associated with the use of CAMs. Results: The mean age of the participants was 57.0 years, and 67.0% reported that they had used CAMs within the past three months. Middle-aged adults were more likely to use CAMs than late middle-aged adults and older adults (p < 0.001). Overall, the major CAMs utilized to relieve psychological stress were music therapies (37.6%), massage (31.1%), spinal manipulation (25.1%), relaxing therapies (24.2%), and reading scriptures or The Bible (23.9%). Religion and vegetarian diets were the most important factors influencing participants to use CAMs, especially music therapies, massage, and reading scriptures/The Bible. Conclusions: CAM use was very prevalent among middle-aged adults in Taiwan; in particular, music therapies were the most favored activities for reducing stress.

Introduction [1](#B1-healthcare-10-02250), [2](#B2-healthcare-10-02250)]. As is well known, the health of middle-aged to older adults (the population aged 45 and above) is the most important concern, which will require increasing attention in the future [ [2](#B2-healthcare-10-02250), [3](#B3-healthcare-10-02250), [4](#B4-healthcare-10-02250), [5](#B5-healthcare-10-02250), [6](#B6-healthcare-10-02250)], as the incidence of chronic disease rises dramatically with age and the majority of patients with a chronic disease are over the age of 65 years. Studies have also reported that the increased prevalence of chronic disease in middle-aged to older populations has led to increased healthcare expenditure, as well as having impacts on their physiological health and psychological stress, eventually affecting their quality of life [ [7](#B7-healthcare-10-02250), [8](#B8-healthcare-10-02250), [9](#B9-healthcare-10-02250)]. [10](#B10-healthcare-10-02250), [11](#B11-healthcare-10-02250), [12](#B12-healthcare-10-02250)]. Accordingly, adults aged 45 years and older with chronic diseases or illness were more worried about the spread of infection and were more likely to experience loneliness and negative mental health consequences during the COVID-19 pandemic period, particularly in Asia [ [13](#B13-healthcare-10-02250), [14](#B14-healthcare-10-02250)]. A growing number of studies have indicated that people worried about becoming infected with COVID-19 and those who experienced considerable levels of stress considered the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) to enhance the balance of their body, mind, and spirit during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic [ [15](#B15-healthcare-10-02250), [16](#B16-healthcare-10-02250), [17](#B17-healthcare-10-02250)]. CAMs are defined as diagnostic procedures, self-care management, and treatment practices, being non-medical interventions that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine. They can generally be classified into several types, such as nutritional, psychological, physical, and combination approaches [ [4](#B4-healthcare-10-02250)]. Studies have indicated that up to 80% of the general population used at least one CAM in the past year. The reasons why they seek CAMs included enhancing disease-fighting properties through antioxidant supplements, improving disease-specific quality of life, increasing vital energy flow, and improving their physical and mental health [ [18](#B18-healthcare-10-02250), [19](#B19-healthcare-10-02250), [20](#B20-healthcare-10-02250)]. Traditional Chinses medicine (TCM) treatments or herbal products, muscle relaxation techniques (e.g., yoga, massage, tai chi, dance, and exercise), functional food and dietary supplements (e.g., probiotics and vitamin D), mindfulness activities (e.g., Ayurveda and Reiki), and aromatherapy were the most popular CAM interventions used at home to ease the symptoms induced by COVID-19 infection, support the immune system to avoid infection, or promote psychological wellbeing in order to return to normal life during this stressful time factors have been reported to be associated with the CAM utilization, such as a strengthened immune system to alleviate infectious diseases, altered nervous system activity to improve mental wellbeing and quality, and regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to relieve psychological stress [ [22](#B22-healthcare-10-02250), [26](#B26-healthcare-10-02250), [27](#B27-healthcare-10-02250)]. Despite the above, most studies have focused on CAM utilization in adult or pediatric populations with no particular focus on CAM use among the community-dwelling middle-aged to older adult population. Taken together, research on the prevalence of usage of different CAMs for emotional management during the COVID-19 public health emergency is sparse in Taiwan. Moreover, the potential factors in relation to CAM utilization also remain under investigation. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of CAM utilization among three age groups\u2014middle-aged adults (ages 46-55), late middle-aged adults (ages 56-65), and older adults (ages 66-75)\u2014in order to examine the influencing factors associated with the most-used CAMs for self-care management and coping with psychological distress during the global pandemic period in Taiwan. The outcomes of this study are important, in terms of allowing healthcare providers and decision makers to evaluate healthcare practices and develop strategies that improve health outcomes in middle-aged to older adults. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Participants 2.2. Cross-Sectional Survey Sampling [28](#B28-healthcare-10-02250)], a public service of Creative Research System survey software, according to the population between years 46 and 75 in Taiwan. To obtain accurate findings, the suitable sample size for interviewing is 384 to allow for a sampling error of 5% (with 95% confidential level) to reflect the demographic profile of Taiwan. In summary, 450 people were recruited and 351 participants completed a valid response. The total response rate was 78% in this study. 2.3. Development of the Survey Form [20](#B20-healthcare-10-02250)], revision based on five expert opinions, and final editing. Questionnaires on CAM uses within the past three months was classified into six categories according to the classification system for various modalities from the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) [ [4](#B4-healthcare-10-02250)]. They were namely nutritional approaches (e.g., herbs, probiotics, dietary supplements, special diets, or microbial-based therapies), psychological approaches (e.g., meditation, music therapies, or relaxing therapies), physical approaches (e.g., acupuncture, massage, or spinal manipulation), combinations of psychological and physical or psychological and nutritional approaches (e.g., yoga, tai chi, qigong, art therapies, aromatherapy, dance therapies, or mindful eating), other complementary health approaches (traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), homeopathy, naturopathy, Ayurvedic medicine, or functional medicine), and other (e.g., far infrared rays, reading scriptures or The Bible, or fortune-telling). The reliability and validity of the questionnaire were 0.863 and 0.90, respectively. 2.4. Survey Distribution 2.5. Data Setting [Supplementary Materials](#app1-healthcare-10-02250). A file for the final version of the questionnaire). 2.6. Statistical Analysis 3. Results [Table 1](#healthcare-10-02250-t001)provides the demographic statistics of the 351 included respondents (78% completion rate). Of the participants, the mean age was 57.0 years and females were the majority (53.8%). Among the three age groups, most of the older adults had more than two children (72.7%, p < 0.001), had attained the education level of high school degree or below (50.0%, p < 0.001), and were retired or did not work (74.3%, p < 0.001). However, more middle-aged adults had a college degree or above (72.3%, p < 0.001), were in a skilled/professional occupation (29.3%, p < 0.001), exercised irregularly (54.2%, p 0.011), drank functional beverages = 0.034), and p < 0.001). In [Table 2](#healthcare-10-02250-t002), the results show that more than half of the participants perceived their health status to be poor/very poor (54.4%) and had a history of chronic disease (59.5%). Of the participants, many older adults had chronic disease (75.8%, p = 0.007), especially hypertension (37.9%, p < 0.001), hyperlipidemia (24.2%, p < 0.001), and sleep disorders (19.7%, p < 0.001). Regarding the use of prescription medication, 72.7% of the older adults took more than one prescription medicine, which was statistically higher when compared with the other two groups of participants (p = 0.046). The use of hypolipidemic agents (21.2%, p and hypnotics (12.1%, p = 0.048) were also significantly in older adults. [Table 3](#healthcare-10-02250-t003)). [Table 4](#healthcare-10-02250-t004)displays the log-binomial regression analyses for CAM use and each of the five top CAMs used to help support the mental stress of participants during the COVID-19 pandemic period, with respect to their independent variables. First of all, religion (Christian/Other, PR = 1.43; 95% CI: CI: 95% CI: 1.08-1.47, 95% CI: 1.03-1.56, p = 0.027) were four positive factors associated with the use of CAMs, whereas late middle-aged adults (PR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.42-0.90, p two negative factors. 4. Discussion [17](#B17-healthcare-10-02250), [29](#B29-healthcare-10-02250)]. Epidemiological studies have indicated that the middle-aged to older population were more affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than young adults and children. Particularly, older adults are generally more susceptible to severe illnesses and have a high mortality rate due to various chronic diseases [ [3](#B3-healthcare-10-02250), [11](#B11-healthcare-10-02250)]. In the past few decades, Taiwan has been faced with challenges associated with the issue of an aging population. The majority of patients with a chronic ailment are over the age of 65 years, and more than 50% of the older population had more than two chronic diseases [ [9](#B9-healthcare-10-02250), [30](#B30-healthcare-10-02250)]. Our data showed that the chronic diseases with higher prevalence among older adults were hypertension (more than 30%) and hyperlipidemia (more than 20%), consistent with other extensive studies conducted over the past several years in both Taiwan and other countries [ [3](#B3-healthcare-10-02250), [24](#B24-healthcare-10-02250), [31](#B31-healthcare-10-02250), [32](#B32-healthcare-10-02250)]. Notably, work pressure or other stress-induced high blood pressure was related to mental health problems and disease-specific quality of life. Other chronic diseases also have been linked to diet; in terms of dietary modification, increased fruit and vegetable intake can decrease the risk of hypertension, obesity, and type 2 diabetes [ [9](#B9-healthcare-10-02250), [33](#B33-healthcare-10-02250)]. Similar to previous reports, our data indicated that middle-aged adults significantly preferred to choose vegetarian diets (79.1%), use CAMs (72.9%), and had less chronic disease (1.2 \u00b1 1.4) than the older adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results can be used in further studies in order to investigate whether healthy eating habits can enhance the health condition or not, especially under pressure. Furthermore, the question regarding whether a vegetarian diet is a predictor for the prevention of disease and maintenance of well-being remains under exploration. [3](#B3-healthcare-10-02250), [15](#B15-healthcare-10-02250), [16](#B16-healthcare-10-02250)]. Recent studies have suggested that middle-aged to older adults tended to seek different kinds of CAM to help them improve the harmony between their mind, body, and spirit [ [6](#B6-healthcare-10-02250), [18](#B18-healthcare-10-02250), [24](#B24-healthcare-10-02250)]. Middle-aged adults, especially women and those with a higher education level, tend to search for more valuable sources of information to use different kind to CAMs and share their experiences with their friends [ [20](#B20-healthcare-10-02250), [30](#B30-healthcare-10-02250), [34](#B34-healthcare-10-02250)]. In Taiwan, the prevalence rate for CAM use in the previous 12 months was 38 to 86% among people aged 18 years and above to maintain their health. The most commonly used CAMs were dietary supplements, massage, spinal manipulation, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) [ [35](#B35-healthcare-10-02250), [36](#B36-healthcare-10-02250)]. Our data showed that the prevalence rate of CAM use to cope with stress in the older adults (57.6%) was significantly lower than in the middle-aged adults (72.9%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding the reason why older people had lower CAM utilization, one reason may be the risk of virus infection for older adults influence them to go out during the COVID-19 outbreak or visit CAM institution. Another possible reasons might be a lack of trained CAM practitioners to give them accurate advice, such as how to use aromatherapy, physical therapy, art therapies, and so on [ [19](#B19-healthcare-10-02250), [35](#B35-healthcare-10-02250)]. The other reason might be influenced by healthcare spending regarding the use of CAMs. Finally, older adults generally have poorer health which makes them or their healthcare givers more likely to consider CAM use for the treatment of their diseases rather than for coping with mental stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, further investigations can be performed in order to understand the causal relationships related to this question. [16](#B16-healthcare-10-02250), [17](#B17-healthcare-10-02250), [35](#B35-healthcare-10-02250)]. Correspondingly, a lower education level and older age might reflect low socio-economic status, thus influencing individuals to use other CAMs. Furthermore, most research only focused on some specific CAM types used in their interested target population; therefore, further investigation is required to explore the correlation of prevalence and patterns of CAM use with the reasons they are used in Taiwan. Another possible reason that might cause our result to have a bias is the sample size of the older adult group. According to the statistics of Taiwan's population, the ratio of our three study groups should be 40:38:22; however, our population ratio is 50:31:19. One possibility is the lower response rates for the 60+ age group misrepresents the actual results of Taiwanese older adults' choices of CAM uses. However, it is difficult to distinguish whether these results can be interpreted in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic or reflect the Taiwanese population's preference for CAM treatments. Notably, in our questionnaire, we have specifically asked our respondents which CAM they used to cope with stress during the COID-19 pandemic period. Therefore, our findings should be interpreted in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic rather than a reflection of the Taiwanese population's preference for CAM treatments. Further investigations should be performed in order to explore the causal relationships related to this issue. [22](#B22-healthcare-10-02250), [27](#B27-healthcare-10-02250)]. In this study, middle-aged adults preferred to use music therapies (e.g., listen music) to relieve their stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially those who had specific religions (e.g., Buddhism and Christian/other) and chose vegetarian diets. One recent study found that mindfulness-based music listening can regulate negative emotions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic in young adults [ [37](#B37-healthcare-10-02250)]. Whether the effect of listening to religious music is similar to mindfulness-based music or mediation music on relieving a body's physiological stress is worth investigating. As is well known, individuals remain in the workforce and have the highest psychological stress responses related to family, economic, and health issues in this stage of life [ [8](#B8-healthcare-10-02250), [34](#B34-healthcare-10-02250)]. It has also been found that music listening interventions or online music therapies have effects on reducing anxiety, enhancing mood, improving mental health, and supporting subjective wellbeing, not only for coping with diagnosed diseases but also for combating COVID-19-induced mood disturbance or mental stress [ [21](#B21-healthcare-10-02250), [26](#B26-healthcare-10-02250), [38](#B38-healthcare-10-02250)]. Some types of music may actually increase negative emotions, although this differential effect of music has not yet been adequately tested. Liu and colleagues' study indicated that sad music increases the young university students' negative mood states, whereas calm and happy music can effectively adjust participants' adverse emotions [ [37](#B37-healthcare-10-02250)]. Interestingly, another report revealed that differences in age and musical expertise will affect individuals' emotion recognition in music [ [39](#B39-healthcare-10-02250)]. Further studies can be designed to evaluate the short- or long-term intervention effects of different types of musical activities and the duration of music listening practices on the causal mechanism of physiological and psychological responses for ameliorating stress, reducing negative emotions, and moderating the quality of life in middle-aged adults. [6](#B6-healthcare-10-02250), [31](#B31-healthcare-10-02250)]. A recently published article has indicated that chiropractic care or spinal manipulation can provide management for musculoskeletal disorders; however, the inappropriate information from social media and the internet provided by chiropractic regulatory agencies which claimed that it can enhance immunity to protect against COVID-19 should be strictly noted by healthcare providers [ [40](#B40-healthcare-10-02250)]. One cross-sectional survey also indicated that massage, TCM, and chiropractic treatments can cause adverse side-effects [ [34](#B34-healthcare-10-02250)]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis results demonstrated that TCM and acupuncture has been frequently used to successfully treat patients' symptoms caused by COVID-19 [ [41](#B41-healthcare-10-02250)]. Our data showed that they were not the main options in middle-aged and older adults during the early stage of COVID-19 in Taiwan. Since the infection rates were significantly augmented after mid-May 2021, further studies can investigate whether TCM or acupuncture was used in patients when they were infected by COVID-19. Additionally, another study revealed that mindfulness practices had positive effects on emotional wellbeing and general health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [ [30](#B30-healthcare-10-02250)]. Another publication also emphasized that mindfulness-based music listening can improve an individual's negative emotions relating to COVID-19 [ [37](#B37-healthcare-10-02250)]. Whether those who used these CAM practices had special religions, occupation, lifestyle, or eating habits which affected their choices remain unclear. Due to the observational nature of this study, further evidence-based systematic studies may be performed to explore the causal relationships related to this issue. [42](#B42-healthcare-10-02250)]. Therefore, this study only focused on the middle-aged and older adults ages 46 to 75. This may lead to biased research results. Finally, with the current data, we could not evaluate the stress-reducing effects of CAM use, limiting our ability to understand the possible associated psychological mechanisms. Further studies could classify participants into high- or low-risk of stress groups to compare their CAM uses during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. 5.
