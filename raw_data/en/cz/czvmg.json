Although there is growing research on the components and outcomes of well-being, very few studies have focused on traditional practices that can be used as interventions to encourage human flourishing. The current study was developed to address this research gap. We suggest one effective method of increasing psychological well-being, the practice of yoga, an age-old practice that has been said to produce physical and psychological health. In this observational study, we examined associations with participation in a 4-week yoga teacher training resident program. Measurement instruments were chosen to capture changes in psychosocial health and human flourishing. Measurements were taken before the start of the program, immediately after the program, and 3 months postprogram. As expected, in this healthy population, the human flourishing scales showed more change than the psychosocial health scales. For example, in this healthy sample, there were no significant changes in perceived social support, quality of life, or self-efficacy from baseline to the 3-month follow-up. However, optimism, a positive psychology research measure, improved from baseline to follow-up. The mindfulness subscales of observation, awareness, and nonreactivity all improved following the training, suggesting that one benefit of yoga practice is a more refined ability to attend to one's inner experience. This study adds to the growing literature focusing on interventions that move beyond relieving pathology to those that produce optimal functioning and human constitute important minority communities in Canada.

This review provides modern and Ayurvedic perspectives on theories and management of a 12 week yoga camp, 40 participating women (m = 34.7) showed significantly improved scores on the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) compared to baseline. The improvement occurred in all six domains of FSFI (i.e., desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain). The improvement was more in older women (age > 45 years) compared with younger women (age < 45 years).| practiced both in developing and developed countries. Many patients and yoga protagonists claim that it is useful in improving sexual functions and treating sexual disorders. AIM: We wanted to study the effect of yoga on male sexual functioning. METHODS: We studied 65 males (age range=?24-60 years, average age=40-8.26 years) who were enrolled in a yoga camp and administered a known questionnaire, i.e., Male Sexual Quotient (MSQ) before and after 12 weeks session of yoga. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MSQ scores before and after yoga sessions. RESULTS: It was found that after the completion of yoga sessions, the sexual functions scores were significantly improved (P<0.0001). The improvement occurred in scores of all the domains of sexual functions as studied by MSQ (desire, intercourse satisfaction, performance, confidence, partner synchronization, erection, ejaculatory control, orgasm). CONCLUSIONS: Yoga appears to be an effective method of improving all domains of sexual functions in men as studied by MSQ.| |Publication||The paper recent research is reviewed on the effects of yoga poses on psychological conditions including anxiety and depression, on pain syndromes, cardiovascular, autoimmune and immune conditions and on pregnancy. Further, the physiological effects of yoga including decreased heartrate and blood pressure and the physical effects including weight loss and increased muscle strength are reviewed. Finally, potential underlying mechanisms are proposed including the stimulation of pressure receptors leading to enhanced vagal activity and reduced cortisol. The reduction in cortisol, in turn, may contribute to positive effects such as enhanced immune function and a lower prematurity rate.| indicate that the overall cancer incidence in the United States, in spite of billions of dollars spent on research each year, has not changed significantly in the last half-century.

This study was done to evaluate the impact of stress on psychological, physiological parameters, and immune system during medical term -academic examination and the effect of yoga practices on the same. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was carried out on sixty first-year MBBS students randomly assigned to yoga group and control group (30 each). The yoga group underwent integrated yoga practices for 35 minutes daily in the presence of trained yoga teacher for 12 weeks. Control group did not undergo any kind of yoga practice or stress management. Physiological parameters like heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure were measured. Global Assessment of Recent Stress Scale and Spielbergers State Anxiety score were assessed at baseline and during the examination. Serum cortisol levels, IL-4, and IFN- levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. RESULT In the yoga group, no significant difference was observed in physiological parameters during the examination stress, whereas in the control group, a significant increase was observed. Likewise, the indicators of psychological stress showed highly significant difference in control group compared with significant difference in yoga group. During the examination, the increase in serum cortical and decrease in serum IFN- in yoga group was less significant (P<0.01) than in the control group (P<0.001). Both the groups demonstrated an increase in serum IL-4 levels, the changes being insignificant for the duration of the study. CONCLUSION Yoga resists the autonomic changes and impairment of cellular immunity seen in examination 15.8 million people in the United States now practice some form of yoga, and nearly half of current practitioners stated they began yoga practice as a means of improving overall health. More broadly understood in a modern context, yoga is a set of principles and practices designed to promote health and well-being through the integration of body, breath, and mind. This article outlines the history of yoga and describes several forms, including asana-based yoga, which is becoming popular in the United States. Research findings related to use of yoga as a therapy for various health problems are reviewed. Guidelines for finding a yoga teacher are offered, as are a number of book and Internet sources most common and controversial issue in many parts of the world. Approximately 46 million abortions are performed worldwide every year. The world ratio is 26 induced abortions per 100 known pregnancies. Pakistan has an estimated abortion rate of 29 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age, despite the procedure being illegal except to save a woman's life. 890,000 abortions are performed annually in Pakistan. Many government and non-government organizations are working on the issue of abortion. Muslim jurists are unanimous in declaring that after the fetus is completely formed and has been given a soul, abortion is haram (forbidden).| |Publication||Human life--Ayurveda is practiced in India since time immemorial.

To date, no study has been conducted on Jain monks. The study comprises of 180 subjects and the overall response rate was 76% among them. Oral hygiene status was assessed by the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S) of Greene, Vermillion14 (1964), and periodontal status was assessed by the Community Periodontal Index. Additional information was collected regarding food habits, education level and oral hygiene habits. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), Chi Square Test and Step-wise multiple linear regression analysis were carried out using SPSS Software (11.0). The results showed that the oral hygiene status of Jain monks was poor and only 5.6% of the subjects had good oral hygiene. Overall periodontal disease prevalence was 100% with bleeding and shallow pocket contributing a major part (72.8%) among all the age groups (p < 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that oral hygiene habits, caloric intake and education level explained a variance of 11.7% for the Oral hygiene index collectively. The findings confirmed that Jain monks have poor oral hygiene and an increased prevalence of periodontal disease compared to that of the similarly aged general population because, as a part of their religion, many Jain individuals avoid brushing their teeth especially during fasting, keeping in mind not to harm the microorganisms present in the is one of the most comprehensive healing systems in the world and has classified the body system according to the theory of Tridosha to overcome ailments.

There is also a progressive trend toward use of yoga as a mind-body complementary and alternative medicine intervention to improve specific physical and mental health conditions. To provide clinicians with therapeutically useful information about yoga, the evidence evaluating yoga as an effective intervention for children and adolescents with health problems is reviewed and summarized. A brief overview of yoga and yoga therapy is presented along with yoga resources and practical strategies for clinical practitioners to use with their patients. The majority of available studies with children and adolescents suggest benefits to using yoga as a therapeutic intervention and show very few adverse effects. These results must be interpreted as preliminary findings because many of the studies have methodological limitations that prevent strong conclusions from being drawn. Yoga appears promising as a complementary therapy for children and adolescents.

Decisions within the Government of India have led to a conducive environment for conducting clinical studies, to achieve integration of more than one system of medicine, so that their combined benefits can be brought to bear on chronic, difficult-to-treat conditions. AIM To develop integrative dermatology treatment protocols for patients with long-standing skin diseases who have received treatment from many centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS A team of doctors from modern dermatology, Ayurveda, yoga therapy, and homeopathy studied recruited patients to develop mutual orientation on each therapeutic system and a working knowledge of approach to their clinical diagnosis. Six-hundred thirty-eight patients affected by lower limb lymphedema requiring skin care as a major part of treatment were treated integrating modern dermatology and Ayurveda. Three-hundred eighty-one vitiligo patients were examined and treated to understand the clinical presentations and treatment options in Ayurveda. RESULTS A two-step cluster analysis performed by SPSS Version 16 showed average volume reductions of 13.3% and 23% on day 14, 19.7% and 31.1% on day 45, and 23.4% and 39.7% on day 90 of treatment in small and large lymphedematous limbs. Inflammatory episodes before the onset on this treatment was reported by 79.5% of our lymphedema patients, and 9.4% reported this at the end of three months after our treatment. Among vitiligo patients, we found that 39.6% of patients had pitta, 10.8% had vatha and 0.52% has tridoshaja presentation. There are over 100 treatment options available in Ayurveda to treat vitiligo. DISCUSSION Each system of medicine recognizes the same disease albeit with minor difference in description. Skin care procedures like washing and emollients restore the barrier function and skin health. We have converged Ayurvedic skin care with that of dermatology with an aim of achieving patient management that is better than that achievable by a single system alone. Overload of the lymphatic system due to loss of epidermal barrier function and consequent inflammation from bacteria and soil irritants is responsive to selected Ayurvedic herbal preparations. CONCLUSION It is evident that integration at the therapeutic level is possible, although the pathological basis is interpreted differently. Irrespective of background understanding of the given disease, a mutually oriented multisystem therapeutic team was able to effectively use medicines from more than one system of medicine and to develop guidelines for their prescription and a patient care algorithm.| of the add-on yogic prana energization technique (YPET) on healing of fresh fractures. Materials and methods: Thirty (30) patients (22 men and 8 women) between 18 and 55 years with simple extra-articular fractures of long and short bones were selected from the outpatient department of Ebnezar Orthopaedic Centre and Parimala Speciality Hospital, Bengaluru. They were randomized into yoga (n = 15) and control (n = 15) groups. Compound, complicated, pathologic fractures, old fractures, and those associated with dislocations were excluded. Both groups received the conventional plaster of paris immobilization of the fracture site as the primary treatment. The yoga group, in addition, practiced YPET twice a day (30 minutes/session) for 2 weeks using taped audio instructions after learning under supervision for 1 week. YPET is an advanced yoga relaxation practice that involves breath regulation, chanting, and visualization, which according to yogic science revitalizes the tissues by activating the subtle energies (prana) within the body. Both the groups were assessed on the 1st and 21st day by the Numerical Pain Rating Scale for pain (NRS), tenderness (0-4), swelling (0-4), fracture line density (1-4), and the bridging of cortices (1-4). Results: Two (2) groups were matched on all variables. The Wilcoxon test showed significant improvement in both groups on all variables. Pain reduction (NRS) was better (p = 0.001 Mann-Whitney test) in the YPET group (94.5%) than in the control group (58.6%); Tenderness reduced (p = 0.001) better in the YPET group (94.4 %) than in the control group (69.12%); Swelling reduced by 93% in the YPET group and by 69.4% in controls (between-groups p = 0.093, i.e., nonsignificant); increase in fracture line density was better (p = 0.001) in the YPET group (48%) than in the control group (18.25%). The number of cortices united was significantly better (p = 0.001) in the YPET group (81.4%) than in controls Conclusions: Add-on yoga-based YPET accelerates fracture healing.| |Publication||Journal on natural products and traditional medicines are re-emerging as attractive options.

Its main objective is to achieve optimal health and well-being through a comprehensive approach that addresses mind, body, behavior, and environment. Ayurveda emphasizes prevention and health promotion, and provides treatment for disease. It considers the development of consciousness to be essential for optimal health and meditation as the main technique for achieving this. Treatment of disease is highly individualized and depends on the psychophysiologic constitution of the patient. There are different dietary and lifestyle recommendations for each season of the year.

Its main objective is to achieve optimal health and well-being through a comprehensive approach that addresses mind, body, behavior, and environment. Ayurveda emphasizes prevention and health promotion, and provides treatment for disease. It considers the development of consciousness to be essential for optimal health and meditation as the main technique for achieving this. Treatment of disease is highly individualized and depends on the psychophysiologic constitution of the patient. There are different dietary and lifestyle recommendations for each season of the year.

All this depicts a new paradigm of the disease state. This paper also examines the scope of plant drugs used in the treatment of cancer. A retrospective meta-analysis of observations on 85 plant drugs reported to have an anticancer effect indicates that herbs with Katu, Tikta, Kasya Rasa pungent, and Katu Vipka (catabolic active metabolites), and herbs with dry, coarse, light, and sharp biophysical properties have significantly greater possibilities of producing anticancer effects.| paper critically examines the Ayurvedic concept of cancer diathesis and its pathogenesis in terms of the theory of Tridosa, Sapta Dhatus (body tissues), the Agni or body's biologic fire, Srot\u00e1msi (i.e., channels of the body), and the generic sequence of events in the genesis of a disease (e.g., Satkriyakala).

The mechanistic model which served biomedicine well for many years is gradually collapsing, thanks to the efforts of dedicated researchers who have looked beyond that model's flaws. Thus we now know that networks of chemical communication exist between the nervous and immune systems, and that prayer at a distance can positively affect the conditions of those who are seriously ill, even when the prayer and the patient are not known to one another. Another participant in this exciting climate of change and ferment is Ayurveda, India's ancient medical system. While Ayurveda has already contributed much to modern medicine (reserpine, gugulipid, plastic surgery), its real contributions are yet to be made. While some of these are likely to come in matters of materia medica and technique, most will likely be derived from Ayurveda's way of seeing the world, its \"darshana.\" This paper outlines a few of the ways in which Ayurveda's \"vision\" is likely to facilitate medicine's ability to teach people not just how to avoid disease but how to proactively develop and maintain a healthy \"state.\"| |Publication||Indian | Modern medical science is currently in the throes of a revolution which is likely to have a dramatic impact on both the theory of medicine and the way it is practised.

The background, paradigm, interventions, scientific research, and strategies to implement Ayurveda in APN practice are explored. Although little is known about Ayurveda in Western cultures, it offers many health promotive interventions that can help the APN fulfill the needs of families who seek a level of wellness not offered by conventional medicine.| | Ayurveda, the oldest health care system in the world, has unique potential waiting to be exploited by the advanced practice nurse (APN) practicing in family health and primary care settings.

Numerous beneficial mental and physical effects have been classically ascribed to this holistic ancient method. The purpose of the present study has been to examine the effects of long-term yoga practice on Subjective Sleep Quality (SSQ) and on several hormonal parameters of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Twenty-six subjects (16 experimental and 10 controls) were recruited to be part of the study. Experimental subjects were regular yoga practitioners with a minimum of 3 years of practice. Blood samples for the quantification of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) were drawn from all subjects. Likewise, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was employed to assess SSQ. As statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U-test was performed. The yoga group displayed lower PSQI scores and higher blood cortisol levels than control subjects. Therefore, it can be concluded that long-term yoga practice is associated with significant psycho-biological differences, including better sleep quality as well as a modulatory action on the levels of cortisol. These preliminary results suggest interesting clinical implications which should paper examines the backgrounds and motivations of persons trained or training as Ayurvedic practitioners at two London-based institutions offering Ayurveda programmes at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. It draws upon in-depth interviews with individuals at various stages of their training and practice in order to examine the paths that bring them to Ayurveda, their motivations for undergoing training, and the ways in which they apply their knowledge of Ayurveda during and after their training period. The findings here corroborate what other scholars have demonstrated in the case of Asian traditions like Yoga and Ayurveda in the West; these traditions have inevitably undergone shifts in meaning by virtue of their assimilation into the Western, in this case British, holistic health milieu. Most significant in Ayurveda's case is the shift away from a preoccupation with remedial medicine (the bedrock of mainstream Ayurveda in modern South Asia), to a focus on self-knowledge and self-empowerment as a path to 'holistic healing' (understood to address mental and spiritual, not just physical, wellbeing). Even though the Ayurvedic curriculum transmitted at the educational institutions in London is based largely on that taught at Ayurveda colleges in India, the completely different orientations and dispositions of students in Britain (as compared to their South Asian counterparts) ensures that the Ayurveda they go on to apply and practise is radically different - this is 'spiritualised' Ayurveda, in radical contrast to the 'biomedicalised' version obtaining in modern mainstream South |Abstract||Religion and spiritual practices are among the resources used by patients to cope with chronic pain. The major concepts of Hinduism that are related to pain and suffering are presented. Ways that Hindu traditions deal with pain and suffering are reviewed, including the concept of acceptance, which has been studied in the pain medicine literature. By becoming more familiar with Hindu views of pain and suffering, pain medicine practitioners can offer potentially helpful concepts to all patients and support Hindus' spirituality as it relates to pain and suffering. PERSPECTIVE: Religion or spirituality is often important to patients. This article will inform the pain medicine practitioner how pain and suffering are viewed in Hinduism, the third largest religion in the world. It is hoped that these concepts will prove helpful when treating not only followers of Hinduism but all patients.| |Publication||The Journal of Pain: Official and spiritual practices are among the resources used by patients to cope with chronic pain.

This report describes the development, advertisement, administration and preliminary results of the survey. Over 1200 Buddhist practitioners responded. Electronic advertisements were the most effective means of recruiting participants. Survey participants were mostly well educated with high incomes and white. Participants engaged in Buddhist practices such as meditation, attending meetings and obtaining instruction from a monk or nun, and practiced healthful behaviors such as regular physical activity and not smoking. Buddhist meditative practice was related to psychological mindfulness and general health.| between buddhist religious practices, health, and psychological characteristics| "}
