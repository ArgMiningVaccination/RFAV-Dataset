Very good results may be achieved. Good luck [HYEONG HWANG](/Expert/2412144-HYEONG-HWANG)Acupuncturist Austin, TX To help alleviate depression, more and more Americans are turning to age-old holistic modalities such as Chinese medicine. \"Chinese medicine, which includes acupuncture, massage and herbal medicine, is a very popular way to help individuals relax and re-energize. It can help with conditions such as anxiousness, depression, insomnia, tense muscles, headaches and pain; all things many of us experience\", said licensed acupuncturist and American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine clinic dean, John Kolenda. The College's low-cost Community Clinics have treated patients with mental illness since the 1980's, and see upwards of 17,000 patient treatments each year. According to Kolenda, many patients report an enhanced sense of well-being and a deep feeling of relaxation after an acupuncture or massage treatment. These modalities alleviate stress and depression symptoms by releasing endorphins, the body's own natural painkillers, and improving the circulation of blood and lymphatic fluids which bring fresh oxygen to body tissues. This increased oxygen flow eliminates waste products from inside the body and enhances recovery from diseases. Acupuncture and massage also decrease the stress hormone cortisol, lower blood pressure, reduce the heart rate, and relax muscle tissue. \"One of the reasons acupuncture and massage are so popular is because they provide health benefits that are also free of side effects when performed by a licensed professional\", Kolenda said.

[Mrs. Rebecca Kitzerow](/Expert/586706-Rebecca-Kitzerow)Acupuncturist La Center, WA Yes, Acupuncture can be helpful and stabilizing in cases of mental illness, but it is always recommended to also work with a therapist and/or a psychiatrist depending on the severity of the issue. [ryan bishop](/Expert/81226544-ryan-bishop)Acupuncturist loxahatchee, fl Yes [Carolyn Shannon Sullivan](/Expert/3501720-Carolyn-Shannon-Sullivan)Acupuncturist Randolph and Stoughton, MA Acupuncture can help balance that which is out of balance in Chinese Medicine theory. But it is NOT a substitute for anti psychotic meds and others when they are needed. Acupuncture can help improve mood, balance hormone levels, lower cortisol levels in the brain (which gives you that happy, euphoric feeling), help with sleep and so on. All of these can improve symptoms related to mental illness but it is NOT a cure all and medications are definitely warranted in most if not all cases. Check with your doctor and psychiatrist to determine which medications are right for you. Good luck!

[Celeste King](/Expert/82738853-Celeste-King)Acupuncturist New Braunfels, TX Yes, acupuncture can help mental emotional disorders by treating several different meridians according to 5 element theory.

McLean](/Expert/82737416-Bonnie-B-McLean)Acupuncturist Gulf Breeze, FL Mental illness needs a multi-pronged approach that might include acupuncture, but I would not recommend acupuncture alone. A psychologist, LCSW, or MSW, and a psychiatrist if medications are needed should be the main therapists in this situation. [Mr. Anthony James Lorenzo](/Expert/2819877-Anthony-James-Lorenzo)Acupuncturist Mental Illness encompasses a book larger than the Bible and is a very vague grouping of sets of symptoms. If you mean depression or anxiety, it usually does, in my experience. [Daisy Dong](/Expert/1916920-Daisy-Dong)Acupuncturist Denver, CO Bipolar, anxiety, and depression.

[Henry Vu](/Expert/82737718-Henry-Vu)Acupuncturist Harvey, LA Yes, but it depends on the severity of mental illness, such as chronic conditions, which can be harder to treat. [Jeff Rippey](/Expert/81225813-Jeff-Rippey)Acupuncturist Saint Joseph, MO It depends on what, exactly, the mental illness is. For issues like mild to moderate anxiety or depression, yes, acupuncture can often be an excellent treatment choice. For more severe anxiety or depression, acupuncture can still help, but it's best to combine acupuncture with more conventional treatment options like pharmaceuticals and therapy. For things like OCD, schizophrenia, borderline personality and so on, again, it's a question of severity. In these cases, you will definitely want to couple acupuncture treatment with more conventional pharmaceuticals and therapy treatments. Whatever the condition and severity, please make sure you're seeing a provider who is state licensed and nationally board certified in acupuncture/Chinese medicine. A person like this will have an L.Ac. or R.Ac. credential and either a Dipl Ac or Dipl OM board certification. To find a provider with these qualifications, go to NCCAOM.org and use their \"Find a Practitioner\" look up.
