Credentials, Education, & Achievements: Master's Degree in Spiritual Psychology from the University of Santa Monica Advanced Certification in Consciousness, Health, and Healing from the University of Santa Monica Life Coaching Certification from the University of Healing Arts Nutrition Certification from the Brain Optimization Institute Bachelors Degree in Ballet from the University of Utah Why I became a coach? Through my own personal journey of healing, I was inspired to share and help facilitate others as they heal. I have worked and studied alongside naturopathic doctors, eastern and western medical doctors, physical therapists, medical intuitives, psychologists, and world-renowned leaders in the healing arts. The result of which is a unique multi-modal philosophy, utilizing a vast understanding of medicine, psychology, spirituality, and coaching. Inspiring and creating the best versions of others is my passion. It is my calling and honor to be in service as a Coach. I am grateful every day I get to support my clients. I've been coaching for over 10 years and truly love what I do! Who I love to coach: Anyone willing to let go of the old and welcome the new. Clients who want to overcome anxiety, depression, lack of direction, or poor boundaries. Clients who are struggling with their hair loss and looking for solutions Clients who have tried many other forms of self-help or counseling but still feel stuck and unsatisfied. Clients who are ready to truly overcome past disappointments and stop self-sabotaging behaviors. Clients who want practical and tangible tools on how to heal and transform their lives. Clients who don't mind my sometimes \"colorful\" (French) language. Clients who know how to laugh and be willing to make growth and change fun. Things you may not know about me: I was a professional ballerina with the esteemed company Ballet West and have performed over 1000 performances including principle, soloist, and corps de ballet. I am a mother of 10-year-old twins. I grew up on a farm in the Midwest and have a special place in my heart for country living. My ideal vacation would be on a tropical island listening to reggae music exploring the jungle or watching the waves crash on the beach. I am a continuous student of life, always growing and developing my personal wholeness and highest self. Praise: Ciria M. 5/26/2020 "}
