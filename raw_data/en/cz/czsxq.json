We assess and treat some conditions through [virtual visits](/content/vmfhorg/en/our-services/primary-care-in-person-and-virtual-care/virtual-visits.html). Our secure online platform enables you to discuss symptoms with a gynecology provider from home or wherever it's convenient for you. We then plan the next steps of care, which may include an in-office exam, lab tests or treatments. Save time during your appointment by filling out forms ahead of time: If you are scheduled for a procedure, find out more about [planning for your surgery](/content/dam/vmfhorg/pdf/legacy-vm/workfiles/surgery/Planning_for_Surgery.pdf). We explain what to expect and how to prepare in the days leading up to it. It's not always easy scheduling gynecology appointments around your period, and you might not have to. We can assess many gynecologic concerns even if you are on your period. And there's no reason to feel self-conscious or embarrassed. If you would feel more comfortable rescheduling, we ask that you call at least 24 hours before the appointment. If you need a gynecologic procedure, it may be best to come back at a later date.
