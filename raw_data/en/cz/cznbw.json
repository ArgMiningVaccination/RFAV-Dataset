This was done not on the basis of a scientific review but by legislative fiat.l Our state along with 12 others has chosen to establish \"Medical Marijuana\" laws in which (as Time magazine said), \"pot is medicine now. Dealers qre called caregivers, and the people who buy their dope- med,icine, are patients\"2 Again this was done not on the basis of scientific review, but by popular vote. At least part of this effort is as Time reports \"legalization via the clinic door\". Supporters of marijuana legalization like billionaire George Soros and activist Richard Cowan began promoting and funding this backdoor strategy to legalization in the early 1990's according to Time (article attached). So instead of making medical decisions about marijuana on the basis of a dispassionate review of scientific evidence and risk-benefit profile, heated politics and ideology drive the discussion. The question I would pose is \"if we are going to use marijuana as a medicine should that approval be determined by the same scientific process we apply to all other drugs? (Marijuana is not just a benign \"herbal\" but is a potent, interesting, and promising drug source). \"lf not, should medical marijuana be exempted from scientific review\"l and be evaluated by referendum? Even the libertarian CATO Institute which favors marijuana legalization does not advocate that substances used as medication should be exempted from scientific validation. Normally, drugs are approved by a rigorous series of studies starting with Phase 1- toxicity & human tolerance, Phase ll - dose response & toxicity, and Phase lll - large testing and evaluation for safety & efficacy. No Phase l. ll. or lll studies have ever been conducted for smoked marUuana. Phase lll studies using sprays of marijuana extract and synthetic pills have been conducted. So both Congress, through inappropriate scheduling, and 13 states, have effectively cast aside the concept that a drug's safety and efficacy should be assessed scientifically on the basis of its risks and benefits. That might be appropriate if the debate was about the legalization of recreationat marijuana.l However, we are discussing medical marijuana. By branding il as \"medical' without the science universally applied to all other drugs, we gain none of the 'Cohen 2009,Medical Marijuana: The Conflict between Scientific Evidence and Political Ideology; Utah Law Review.

Regarding the Montana law: - there is no process for scientific review for indications of use. - no requirements of physicians to monitor those they approve - in fact the law encourages quick evaluations for cash with little or no obligation/responsibility to the patient. - no training, education, standard or expertise required of those who manufacture, dispense, and advise regarding the drug. No ethical standard of care. - no standards regarding potency, purity, or lack of contaminants for the drug. - no insurance requirement of the suppliers in the case of harm occurring from their product. - the law encourages many suppliers and profiteering. - no meaningful means to track supplies and amounts in even a rudimentary fashion (in the rest of the medical world every milliliter of controlled drug must be accounted for) - since an illegal market still exists - it is inevitable that there will be increased diversion of the drug to other groups. None of the possible benefits of legalization occur. - no requirement for truthful labeling or advertising regarding the product. Let me illustrate by walking through a \"medical marijuana\" website with you. In summary, the law is too flawed and should be scraped. Better solutions are possible, but we should start from the ground up. lf we are going to call it medical then we should not exempt it from the usual scientific validation. lf we are going to legalize it then we should not drag medicine into it.

Research in this area has had mixed results. While some studies have shown cannabis to be useful in helping patients manage the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia, some patients report an increase !n symptoms when cannabis is used. To date. there has only been one formal clinical study on the effecls of cannabis on tardive dyskinesia patients. Clinicians administered a rating lesl used to measure the severity of symptoms in tardive dyskinesia patients, called the Abnormal Involuntary Movemeni Scale or AIMS. Patients who were older, female and had had the disorder for a longer time showed the worst symptoms. More significanlly however, those with the highest AIMS scores were those who had used recreational cannabis. Since tardive dyskinesia is largely due to the side effects of drugs used to treat psychosis, it seems appropriate to discuss lhe connection between cannabis use and mental disorders. . \\/vhile there is little harm in occasional. moderate use of cannabis, most clinical evidence shows a strong link between heavy, regular use and the development of certain kinds of mental disorders. Vvhile scientitic evidence does not suggest that cannabis is helpful for trealing tardive i:: dyskinesia, some pa*nts do report that their use of marijuana relieves their symptoms. However, these reports are anecdotal and not scientiflc. ll would seem inadvisable to use cannabis for such purposes without discussing it with a doclor.

Interestingly, medical marijuana for symptom relief is not the subject of the new study. Rather, a group of researchers based in the U.K. found that people with IBD had more cannabinoid receptors in the tissues of their colons than did people without the disease. Cannabinoids are molecules produced in the body that closely resemble a group of compounds found in the cannabis plant -- the same compounds that are responsible for the plant's unique pharmacological effects. \"The system that responds to cannabis in the brain is present and functioning in the lining of the gut,\" said lead researcher Dr. Karen Wright of the University of Bath. She and her colleagues found the location of cannabinoid receptors CBI and CB2 in the tissues of the colon. They observed that CB2 was increased in IBD, along with the heightened wound-healing effects associated with the activity of cannabinoids. As IBD often involves damage to the lining of the intestine, cannabinoids merit the attention of the scientific community, the researchers believe. Both the psychoactive effects and the legal issues associated with marijuana use make it unsuitable as a treatment, said Dr. Wright. However, she added, it might be possible to produce a cannabis-like drug with all the therapeutic benefits and none of the other effects of cannabis. With cannabis-based medicines already being used for multiple sclerosis in some countries, that possibility doesn't seem far-fetched. But not so fast, warns IBD expert Dr. Jonathan Markowitz, a member of CCFA's National Scientific Advisory Committee O,ISAC). At best, hd said, the British study offers preliminary evidence that justifies furthef researchinto the role of cannabinoids and their receptors in bowel physiology. \"I think it's still safe to say that there is no evidence to date that cannabis is an effective treatment for IBD,\" he said. As for symptom alleviation, Dr. R. Balfour Sartor, chairperson emeritus of the NSAC, has expressed strong opposition to marijuana as a palliative in IBD: \"Because IBD is an illness that lasts a lifetime, patients and their physicians should concentrate on discovering the cause of the symptoms and pinpointing a treatment that will control them without causing adverseffi wAs a potentialtherapy for inflammatory bowel disease (lBD), cannabis-based drugs may hold promise, according to a report published in the August issue of Gastroenterology -- but that doesn't mean it's time for people with IBD to start smoking marijuana. Although the illegal drug has been used to reduce nausea and pain in patients with terminal illnesses, CCFA's medical leadership does not support the use of \"medical marijuana\" in effects. Using a substance such as marijuana to alleviate symptoms only masks the actual problem.\" Today, patients have access to more medications than ever -- medications capable of controlling symptoms and dramatically improving qualiry of' life. CCFA's expert consensus remains: The harmful side effects of . marijuana far outweigh its potential benefits. In other words, until a nerX cannabinoid-based drug comes to market, don't go there. & eOHTtSf*lj$*I)*T{{}*f {}f * df r r,*s: ffi@ 2009 CCFA I All medical information on this Web site has been CCFA's National Scientific Advisorv Committee Privacv Policv I Contact Usreviewed members ofNorthern Lights Medical Marijuana - \"links We Support\" Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric Aids Foundation linkNorthern Lights Medical Marijuana - \"links We Support\" National Pain Foundation linkLiving AlternativeandComplementary and Pain Management Marijuana and Pain Management l: BillMcCarberg, M.D. U Millions of people in the United States suffer from chronic pain, and much of that suffering cannot be relieved adequately by existing treatments. Patients are in desperate need of new pain management approaches. Cannabinoid medicines appear very promising, although the subject often is obscured by controversy, prejudice, and confusion in part because cannabinoids have some relation to the cannabis plant - also known by the slang term marijuana, What scientific reasons do doctors have to think that cannabinoids actually work? Do they provide genuine symptom improvement, or do patients become intoxicated and merely think that their symptoms are reduced? Basic research conducted over the past 20 years provides us with many answers. ln the early 1990s, researchers identified the cannabinoid receptor system. This system is found in some of the most primitive animal forms on earth - it is also the most widespread receptor system in the human body. The cannabinoid receptor system has two types of receptors: r CB1 receptors are found primarily in the brain, spinal cord, and periphery. t QB2 receptors are on the immune tissues. Specific molecules (called endocannabinoids) are produced by the body that interact with these CBI and CB2 receptors, much like endorphins interact with the body's opioid receptor system. These findings initiated a new era of scientific interest and research in cannabinoids. Numerous studies have now established that cannabinoids help lessen pain and affect a wide range of symptoms and bodily functions. Such research has also demonstrated that cannabinoids may work together with opioids to enhance their effectiveness and reduce tolerance. This body of research has allowed cannabinoids to be informally classified into three types: e endocannabinoids (produced by the body). phytocannabinoids (produced by the cannabis plant) l. synthetic cannabinoids (produced in the laboratory)v Each type is being studied aggressively, but because endocannabinoids are quickly metabolized and probably cannot be patented, they have not yet been researched in humans. What progress is being made toward developing cannabinoids as prescription pain relievers? Some cannabinoids are unstable and many are insoluble in water, which makes them difficult to research and turn into modern medicines. Patients react very differently to cannabinoids. Data from recent clinical trials are encouraging, but somewhat mixed. Looking closely at the results suggests that composition and delivery route (i.e., how a medicine is administered) are extremely important to the viability of cannabinoid medicines. The Delivery Route \\y'y'hen taken orally, cannabinoids are not very well absorbed and often have unpredictable effects. Patients often become sedated or have intoxication- like symptoms when tetrahydrocannabinol (THC - the primary psychoactive cannabinoid in cannabis) is metabolized by the liver. A small number of studies with Marinol (synthetic THC in sesame oil in a gelatin capsule) and Cesamet (synthetic THC analogue) have shown some effectiveness in pain relief, but optimal doses that relieve pain often cannot be achieved because of unpleasant psychologic side effects. lnhaling cannabinoids, especially THC, also may cause problems for many patients. Blood levels rise suddenly and then drop off sharply. This rapid on- off effect may produce significant intoxication, particularly in patients who are new to cannabinoids. This may pose the risk of abuse potential. Smoking cannabis produces this effect, which is the very reason that recreational users prefer the inhaled route. Patients, however, generally wish to avoid psychologic effects, and it is unclear how difficult it might be to find a dosing pattern that enables them to have pain control without side effects. A new product, called Sativex, was approved by Health Canada in June 2005 for marketing as an adjunctive medicine for central neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis. Adjunctive therapy means taking two or more medications to help control pain. Sativex has a different delivery system - an oromucosal/sublingual spray absorbed by the lining of the mouth - that, according to the manufacturer, Ielerally allows patients to gradually work up to a stable dose at which they obtain therapeutic pain relief without unwanted psychologic effects. flll-the United States, Sativex is being studied in large randomized trials in cancer pain that has not been adequately relieved by opioids. Three early and six pivotal controlled studies in the United Kingdom demonstrated positive results treating chronic pain of various origins including neurologic pain, various symptoms of multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer pain. Initial results show improvement in pain for more than one year despite lack of effectiveness of the opioids. Common adverse effects of Savitex have included complaints of bad taste, stinging, dry mouth, dizziness, nausea or fatigue.Additional research also may uncover other ways of avoiding the problems associated with oral or inhaled delivery. Ajulemic acid, a synthetic cannabinoid, binds to both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, and has shown benefit in a small neuropathic pain trial. lt may have reduced psychologic effects and is being studied for the treatment of interstitial cystitis. ] rnt\".nlay of Gannabinoids The use of herbal cannabis - usually smoked * has received considerable media attention since California and Arizona passed \"medical marijuana\" initiatives in 1996. Despite numerous anecdotal reports of effectiveness, very few controlled studies have been published in the pain area. Little is knoryn about the number of patients who actually experience some degree of benefit or side effects. ,: Furthermore, herbal cannabis is neither standardized nor monitored for quality. The cannabinoid content can vary a great deal, and cannabis sold at dispensaries may be contaminated with pesticides or mold. Dosing is uncertain, depending on the preparation or method of use. So-called \"vaporizers\" do not eliminate all the contaminants. Without clinical trial data and an assurance of product quality, physicians lack the information necessary to assist patients in making informed therapeutic decisions. Both the FDA and Institute of Medicine have stated that there is no future for herbal cannabis as a prescription medicine. Nevertheless, there may be some truth to the idea that there is pain relief potential in phytocannabinoids (plant-based cannabinoids) and that such potential may be affected by the interaction of THC with other botanical components, particularly with other cannabinoids. Modern strains of cannabis have been bred to maximize the THC at the expense of all other cannabinoids, most of which do not have psychologic effects. Some of those cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD), have been demonstrated to have important therapeutic value, particularly on pain and inflammation. Concluding Thoughts The possibilities for cannabinoid medicines are very promising, and much exciting research is proceeding at a rapid pace. As new FDA-approved cannabinoid products become available, physicians and patients will have a solid scientific foundation from which to assess their appropriateness. Hopefully, robust scientific data will soon allow cannabinoids to take their place - along with opiates and other pain relievers - in the modern medical supply for treating chronic pain. Bilt H.

Primarily, the most painfui areas were in my feet.\" O'Malley, 39, was diagnosed with MS in 1992. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that attacks the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain, spinal cord and cranial nerves. Symptoms, including chronic and acute pain and inflammation, arise from damage to nerve fibers. The disease causes the destruction of myelin, the fatty tissue lining of nerves. This causes scarring of faulty transmission of nerve impulses- Sometimes, the nerve fibers themselves suffer damage. MS can be diagnosed spinal fluid examination, and the lesions can be detected through magnetic resonance imaging (MRl.) O'Malley described her first pain sensation as the \"pins and needles' feeling familiar to most MS patients. The tingling started in her feet and evenlually developed into leg pain so severe it felt like third-degree burns. Over the past five years, O'Malley has taken Valium, gabapentin (Neurontin), and amitriptyline. Gabapentin, an antiepileptic medication, can alleviate some types of pain associated with MS. O'Malley's physician also prescribed amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant commonly used to manage the way the body reacts to pain. 'l didn't see an improvement,\" recalled O'Malley. \"They thought if they got to the appropriate dosage for me, the combination could work. I had the side effects of fatigue and exhaustion that increased with the dosage.' She feared, too, that even if she tried narcotic analgesics, the potential reduction in pain might bear another cost of its own. \"My doctors told me that with pain like I was describing, most people have only one desire, to get out of the pain. I asked a lot of questions and wasn't really open to the idea of getting involved with drugs that powerful and potentially debilitating, maybe drugs that would require I lie in bed all day.' Meanwhile, O'Malley's pain intensified. \"l dealt with that pain for almost two years. I couldn't put my feet on the ground. I had to start using the wheelchair more and more.\" A pain management specialist pointed out to O'Malley that combining pain management drugs does not result in a \"2 + 2 = 4\" approach. \"The pain specialist indicated that it's an exponential effect, as far as how the medications affect you. The medications I was taking would temporarily take the pain away, but then it would come back. Each time they upped the ante, the fatigue would always increase, but it did not always take the pain away. Often, it would come back stronger.\" Multiple sclerosis (MS) can cause pain due to complications arising from the autoimmune disease's attack on the CNS. While pain may affect MS patients to different degrees and wilh highly varying frequency, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society reports that pain syndromes are not uncommon. One study indicated 55% of participants had 'clinically significant pain\" due to MS symptoms, while almost half (48%) suffered chronic pain. 'The pain and paresthesias associated with MS are quite a variable and individualized problem,\" said Jeffrey Rome, MD, Medical Director of the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Pain Rehabilitation Center in Rochester, Minn. Paresthesias are abnormal sensations, often described as numbness or sensory loss. \"For some persons with MS, pain is not at all an issue; for others, a major symptom and obviously quite variable in terms of location,\" said Rome. \"The therapeutic approaches to this symptom of MS are different from one person to the next.\" According to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies of Medicine, pain that afflicts people with MS can be divided into four broad categories. Neuropathic pain is chronic or recurring pain resulting from the abnormal function of the brain and spinal cord. This is caused by the demyelinating process that strips nerves of their myelin lining. Myelin is crucial to normal transmission of impulses. Trigeminal neuralgia, a stabbing pain in the face, and tonic spasms, severe pain lasting no more than two minutes, are forms of neuropathic pain, as well as Lhermitte's sign, a brief, stabbing, electric-shock-like sensation that runs from the back ofthe head down the spine, brought on by bending the neck forward. Acute pain is that which results from the active inflammatory process. Examples would be optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve lhat leads to severe eye pain) and headache. Pain secondary to increased muscle tone includes cramps and pain related to spasticity, a condition in which certain muscles are continuously contracted, causing stiffness and tightness of the muscles. Chronic or recurrent pain of a nonspecific nature such as neck or back pain can result from muscle weakness. Myofascial pain due to disuse and spasticity can cause constant pain in various regions or pain that subsides but returns with regularity. http://ll''W.nationalpainfoundation.o .glafticles 147 4lmanag ing-pain-with-ms Page 1 of 4l\\4anaging Pain With Ms 3/8/11 8:25 PM \"There are a wide variety of pharmacologic approaches, from disease modifying agents, to adjuvant medications for neuropathic pain, to simple and opioid analgesics, to behavioral and complementary techniques,\" said (diazepam.) John Richert, Professor of Neurology and Professor and Chair of Microbiology and lmmunology at Georgetown University, helped MS patients manage their pain atthe university's MS clinicfor 15 years.'The most common pain complaints of MS patients involve t.igeminal neuralgia, nerve root distribution and pain in the extremities,\" said Richert. He indicated that one group of medications often prescribed are anticonvulsants. \"ln MS, the nerve root entry zone to the spinal cord can be affected by inflammatory processes and demyelinization. The electrical properties of neurons are affected by these drugs.' Richert pointed out that a second group of drugs, tricyclic antidepressants can also be beneficial in treating pain in MS patients. \"The effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants is probably related to the effect on the seratonergic neurotransmitter system,\" said Richert. \"One does not have to be depressed for an antidepressant to work on neurogenic parn.\" Baclofen, a centrally acting muscle relaxant, can alleviate muscle spasticity, subsequently relieving associated spasmodic pain. The medication can be administered orally, by injection or through an implanted pain pump that delivers Baclofen directly into the fluidjilled space surrounding the spinal cord by way of a catheter. According to the Multiple Sclerosis International Foundation, morphine (morphine sulfate) and other (levorphonal) relieve pain by acting as \"false\" neurotransmitters at receptor sites in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and in the brain stem. In a report at lmmunesupport.com, Michael Rowbotham, MD, Professor of Clinical Neurology and Anesthesia at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), explained the potential benefits of using opioids, or narcotic pain relievers like levorphonal, in the treatment of neuropathic pain, as examined in a 2003 study funded by the National Institutes of Health (NlH.) \"The study shows that opioids can be beneficial for relief of neuropathic pain, but don't help everyone,\" said Rowbotham. \"The beneflts must be weighed against the drawbacks for each patient. Some may take a dose high enough to produce many side effects, but still experience no relief of their pain.\" Side effects of opioids may include restlessness, depression and behavior changes. Multiple sclerosis patients participating in the study were among those who experienced particularly beneficial effects while taking high doses of levorphonal. Over-the-counter pain relievers like aspirin show minimal effectiveness in relieving MS-associated pain, yet a recent study in the April 12, 2005, issue of Neurology indicated that aspirin may reduce the fatigue prevalent among MS patients. lbuprofen and naproxen, anti-inflammatory medications available without prescription, can relieve backache and muscle soreness. Rhonda Barker, 49, lives in Amarillo, Texas, and suffered intractable ear pain for two years, due to her MS, which was diagnosed in 1994. \"My first bout of pain with MS was with retrobulbar neuritis,' said Barker. \"l lost the vision in my right eye and had severe eye pain. They heated my MS with lV steroids. The pain went away, but then it came back.\" Six years later, Barker developed unbearable ear pain. \"l had an MRl, and they found six lesions on my brain and on my right optic nerve,\" recalled Barker. \"l was diagnosed with lrigeminal neuralgia, which is usually severe face pain, but with me, it was more of a horrible earache, a deep pain way down in there, not just on the surface.\" The ear pain never let up. \"l had it for two years. lt was constant,\" said Barker. \"l saw ENTs, [ear, nose and throat doctorsl since it felt ear related, and continued my lV steroids. Eventually, they told me I would just have to learn to live with it. They gave me Neurontin. I got up to 1800 mg per day on that. Still, I had the pain.\" Her doctors added Tegretol, another anticonvulsant used to treat chronic pain, to no avail. Reaching the limit of her pain tolerance, Barker sought help from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society- \"l asked them if they knew of other doctors I could see,\" said Barker. \"They sent me to a neurologist in Dallas.' Together, Barker and her neurologist adjusted her Neurontin dosage and added Topamax (topiramate) and Tripleptal (oxcarbazepine), Indocin (indomethacin), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Finally, the drug regimen worked. \"lt had been four years since my first onset of ear pain, but finally, the medication eliminated the pain,\" said Barker. http:/ /wwwjnationalpainfoundation.orylatticlesl4T 4lmanaging-pain-with-ms 3/8/11 8:25 PNI Afler her odyssey of seeking and finding relief from her Ms-related pain, Barker recommends that people with MS should rely on the expertise of an MS specialist. \"l go to the University of Texas Southwestern every six months,' said Barker. \"There are five MS specialists there. I see Dr. Kathleen Hawker. All I have to do is email her physician's assislant with any problems, and she gets back io me, usually the same day.' Many pain management centers, like that at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., combine drug therapies with complementary therapies, such as exercise, diet, nutritional supplements, acupuncture, and stress management. On the pharmaceutical horizon, cannabinoids, chemical derivatives of marijuana plants, provide interesting and promising options for the treatment of neuropathic pain. ;|/arirot lOronabindl is the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved synthetic cannabindid. lt is prescribed for the treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. In clinical trials, the medication also has shown to be notably effective in lreating CNS-mediated pain in people with MS. Kristina B. Svendsen, MD, with the Danish Pain Research Center and department of neurology at Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, examined the effectiveness of cannabinoids in the treatment of central pain of MS, as reported in the British Medical Journal in July 2004. In Svendsen's study, 24 patients wiih MS who experienced central pain took capsules containing dronabinol, a cannabis extradt, or a placebo capsule for three weeks. In the study, central pain was pain in a body area that led to abnormal sensation when subjected to a pinprick, touch, or changes in temperature. The patients also recorded their pain intensity. Those taking the cannabis extract had significantly lower pain intensity as well as greater pain relief compared with patients taking the placebo, according to published reports. They also had less pressure-related pain and better mental health. The greatest pain relief came during their final week of treatment. Solvay Pharmaceuticals, maker of the dronabinol capsules, is currently developing a pulmonary dronabinol, an inhalant, for use in the treatment of migraine, nausea, pain management and spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis. Sativex is another new cannabis-based medication. In April 2005, GW Pharmaceuticals received an approval with conditions from Health Canada for the drug's use as an adjunctive treatment for the symptom relief of neuropathic pain in MS. Sativex contains extracts of chemically and genetically characterized Cannabis saliva L. marijuana plants and is administered as an oral spray. Cfunently, no FDA testing is scheduled fof US markets. In February of 2005, Biogen ldec and Elan announced the voluntary suspension in the marketing of Tysabri (ziconotide), an MS therapy for chronic pain. Serious adverse events thatoccurred in patients treated with Tysabri in combination with Avonex (lnterferon beta-1a) led tothe suspension. Ultimately, MS patients who are unable to squash persistent pain should consult with MS and pain medicine specialists to resolve pain issues and find the most effective balance of therapies. Frances O'Malley found relief from her unrelenting leg pain in the form of a new antidepressant. \"l recently went to a doctor of physical therapy,' said O'Malley. \"This doctor told me about a new antidepressant called Cymbalta. I took my first dose in January, and the next morning I awoke pain free. I slowly tapered off eveMhing else, except Baclofen. Presently, I take two 30-mg doses of Cymbalta before bed. Now I'm working on walking and go to physical therapy three to four times a week. I'm back at work part-time. lt's been like night and day.' Regaining function and the ability to return to work proved a major milestone for O'Malley after her release from the restrictions of intractable pain. She has a book of photography in the works and looks forward to possibly returning to work full-time. \"l think it is so important for MS patients to stay as active as possible,\" said O'Malley. \"You should eat well. Physical therapy helps, too. The pain relief, for me, has given back a much greater level of activity. Instead of turning people away because of the pain, I feel befter and want to get with people. The pain can really isolate you. I don't have to put those things off now that the pain is gone. Pain was truly the debilitating aspect of my MS.\" O'Malley also warns patients that describing your pain effectively to physicians is imperative in receiving the best treatment. \"There is a tendency for doctors to think that all your pain is due to the MS,\" said O'Malley. \"Be sure the backache you might be having isn't due to something other than your MS. You have to be careful in how you describe your pain to doctors. Be as specific as possible. You really have to try and try until you and your doctors find what works best for you.'

However, these products are less effective than safer and more available medicines. Most research regarding marijuana use took place before some current medications with fewer side effects were available. The high dose of marijuana necessary to produce a clinically relevant effect on IOP in the short term requires constant inhalation, as much as every three hours. The number of significant side effects generated by long-term oral use of marijuana or long-term inhalation of marijuana smoke make marijuana a poor choice in the treatment of glaucoma, a chronic disease requiring proven and effective treatment. Currently, marijuana is designated as a Schedule I drug (drugs which have a high potential for abuse and no medical application or proven therapeutic value). The only marijuana cuffently approved at the Federal level for medical use is Marinol, a synthetic form of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the most active component of marijuana.It was developed as an antiemetic (an agent that reduces nausea used in chemotherapy treatments), which can be taken orally in capsule form. The effects of Marinol on glaucoma are not impressive. |f\" date, no studies have shown that marijuana- or any of its approximately 400 chemical components-canr - safely and effectively lower intraocular pressure better than the variety of drugs currently on the markgt. Currently, there are no National Eye Institute studies in the United States concerning the use of marijuana to treat glaucoma. The Glaucoma Research Foundation will continue to monitor the research community for any new and well- designed studies regarding the use of marijuana to effectively treat glaucoma.

A simple definition: non-standard, unconventional therapy for treating glaucoma. In the US, use of alternative medicine has increased l0 to 15 percent in the past ten years.lnfact,12 million adult Americans spend an estimated $27 billion a year on alternative medications. Reportedly, some 50 percent of glaucoma patients use some form of alternative therapy. The following summary is derived from an extensive review of the literature and studies, with personal experience of this author. The results seem rather negative. It's important to remember that aspirin is derived from the willow tree, and pilocarpine - the first used drug for glaucoma - was a plant extract. A part of this report is to encourage needed research in this area. Vitamins - Vitamin A is an antioxidant. Studies have shown it has no effect on intraocular pressure (IOP) or visual field. Vitamin B1, or Thiamin, also reportedly has no effect on IOP or visual field. Vitamin B12 improved visual field in one 9-month study, but scientists consider the study inadequate. Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is found in the aqueous humor that fills the front of the eye. To effectively reduce IOP, massive doses of vitamin C are required, making it impractical due to related complications (diarrhea and dehydration). Topical uses have shown little effect. Vitamin E is an antioxidant, but studies thus far have shown no effect on IOP or visual field. Marijuana - There are 400 different chemicals in marijuana, some of which may be damaging. Moderately long{ Lterm studies have shown that cannabis has no proven effect on glaucomr. When ingested, marijuana does produce ! 20 percent decrease in intraocular pressure; however, the decrease in pressure is only for a short period of time.- In order to be effective as a medication, it would need to be taken many times a day. Side effects of this would be loss of concentration and coordination, and risk of emphysema and lung cancer. Topical use has shown no effect in studies to date, but cannabis derivatives are currently being studied in laboratory tests to determine if they may be effective. Much more work is needed to determine if cannabis derivatives will have a proven effect in glaucoma treatment. Herbal remedies - Ginkgo biloba is an antioxidant.In one study of patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma, it was reported that ginkgo \"appears to improve visual fields in some.\" However, this study was criticized as poorly controlled. More long-term studies need to be conducted to determine if ginkgo has any proven effect on visual field. Ginkgo biloba increases ocular blood flow and may provide a neuroprotective effect. Bilbeny is supposed to promote optic nerve health, but there is no evidence to support this claim. Diet - Drinking large quantities of water within a short period of time (one quart within 5 minutes) may increase intraocular pressure and may have a negative effect. A person's weight does not affect IOP. Meditation - Long-term practice of meditation may help reduce IOP, but the reduction would not be significant. Acupuncture - Many studies have been done, and in most cases there were no changes in IOP or visual field, except for one report indicating a minor change in visual field. Exercise - Moderate exercise over time can result in a lowering of IOP that can last several months. In addition to helping lower pressure, exercise helps the brain, the heart, and the cardiovascular system. We encourage patients ^.to exercise appropriately. -Article by John Hetherington, MD. Dr. Hetherington is Clinical Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of http: / /www. ri'r:c;ht; l;rrr,ricgi,; Canadian Society policy statement on the medical use of marfiuana for glaucoma Yvonne M Buys MD, FRCSC; PhD, FRCSC The marijuana plant Cannqbis sativa has long been recognized to have medicinal properties.l ln 1964 the active component of marijuana, As-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), was isolated and its structure defined.z In addition to its psychotropic effects, THC also acts as an analgesic, appetite stimulant and nausea suppressant. The intraocular pressure lowering effects of marijuana were first reported in 1971.3 Since then other studies have confirmed the intraocular pressure lowering effect of THC by various modes of administration including inhalational,a oral,s intravenous,6 sublingual,T and topical.s Although topical application might seem to be an optimal route of administration, ocular penetration has been poor due to the high lipophilicity and low aqueous solubility of the cannabinoid extracts. Topical preparations have also been noted to cause local irritation and corneal damage. ln addition some studies have failed to find a hypotensive effect of topical THC.e'to The oral route has also been limited by variable absorption.5 The mechanism of intraocular pressure reduction is not well understood.tt-t'The maximum hypotensive effect occurs between 60-90 minutes and the duration of action of is brief at only 3-4 hours.3'14 The main problems with inhaling the smoke of burning marijuana are the side effects which acutely include psychotropic effects (euphoria, dysphoria, decreased short-term memory, cognitive impairment, time distortion, decreased co-ordination, sleepiness),a's tachycardia, palpitations, systemic hypotension8 and conjunctival hyperaemia. The long-term effects of smoking marijuana include emphysema and possible lung cancer.ls There are also concerns about the potential addictive properties and the development of tolerance.16 The clinical utility of marijuana for the treatment of glaucoma is limited by the inability to separate the potential clinical action from the undesirable neuropsychological and behavioural effects. The Canadian Ophthalmological Society does not support the medical use of marijuana for the treatment of glaucoma 6 due to the short duration of action, the incidence of undesirable psychotropic and other systemic side effects and the absence of scientific evidence showing a beneficial effect on the course of the disease+ This is in contrast to other more effective and less harmful medical, laser and surgical modalities for the treatment of glaucoma.

B issue of Nature, researchersfromthe Stanford University School of Ieilhe report that endocannabinoids, naturally occurring chemicals found in the brain that are similar to the rctive compounds in marijuana and hashish, helped trigger a dramatic improvement in mice with a condition ;imilar to Parkinson's. This study points to a potentially new kind of therapy for Parkinson's disease,\" said senior author Robert Ialenka, MD, PhD, the Nancy Friend Pritzker Professor in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. \"Of course, it is a rng, long way to go before this will be tested in humans, but nonetheless, we have identified a new way of ntentially manipulating the circuits that are malfunctioning in this disease.\" /alenka and postdoctoral scholar Anatol Kreitzer, PhD, the study's lead author, combined a drug already used to reat Parkinson's disease with an experimental compound that can boost the level of endocannabinoids in the rrain. When they used the combination in mice with a condition like Parkinson's, the mice went from being frozen n place to moving around freely in 15 minutes. \"They were basically normal,\" Kreitzer said. ]ut Kreitzer and Malenka cautioned that their findings don't mean smoking marijuana could be therapeutic fog )arkinson's disease, It turns out the receptors for cannabinoids are all over the brain, but they are not always activated by the taturally occurring endocannabinoids,\" said Malenka. The treatment used on the mice involves enhancing thg rctivity of the chemicals where they occur naturally in the brain. \"That is a really important difference, and it iq vhy we think our manipulation of the chemicals is really different from smoking marijuana.\"4 -he researchers began their study by focusing on a region of the brain known as the striatum. They were nterested in that region because it has been implicated in a range of brain disorders, including Parkinson's, le5sion, obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction. -heE-ctivity of neurons in the striatum relies on the chemical dopamine. A shortage of dopamine in the striatum nn lead to Parkinson's disease, in which a person loses the ability to execute smooth motions, progressing to nuscle rigidity, tremors and sometimes complete loss of movement. The condition affects 1.5 million Americans, rccording to the National Parkinson Foundation.It turns out that the striatum is much more complicated than imagined,\" said Malenka. The striatum consists of ;everal different cell types that are virtually indistinguishable under the microscope. To uncover the individual ;ontributions of the cell types, Malenka and Kreitzer used genetically modified mice in which the various cell types ve;alabeled with a fluorescent protein that glows vivid green under a microscope. Having an unequivocal way tojOf the cells allowed them to tease apart the functions of the different cell types. /lalenka's lab has long studied how the communication between different neurons is modified by experience and lisease. In their examination of two types of mouse striatum cells, Kreitzer and Malenka found that a particular orm of adaptation occurs in one cell type but not in the other. Ialenka said this discovery was exciting because no one had determined whether there were functional lifferences between the various cell types. Their study indicated that the two types of cells formed complementary ;ircuits in the brain. )ne of the circuits is thought to be involved in activating motion, while the other is thought to be involved in estraining unwanted movement. \"These two circuits are critically involved in a push-pull to select the appropriate novement to perform and to inhibit the other,\" said Kreitzer. )opamine appears to modulate these two circuits in opposite ways. \\Men dopamine is depleted, it is thought that he pathway responsible for inhibiting movement becomes overly activated -- leading to the difficulty of initiating notion, the hallmark of Parkinson's disease. )urrent treatment for Parkinson's includes drugs that stimulate or mimic dopamine. lt turns out that the neurons (reitzer identified as inhibiting motion had a type of dopamine receptor on them that the other cells didn't. The esearchers tested a drug called quinpirole, which mimics dopamine, in mice with a condition similar to human )arkinson's disease, resulting in a small improvement in the mice. That was sort of expected,\" said Malenka. \"The cool new finding came when we thought to use drugs that boost he activity of endocannabinoids.\" Based on prior knowledge of endocannabinoids and dopamine, they speculated nU two chemicals were working in concert to keep the inhibitory pathway in check. Vhen they added a drug that slows the enzymatic breakdown of endocannabinoids in the brain -- URB597, being leveloped by Kadmus Pharmaceuticals in lrvine, Calif. -- the results were striking. The dopamine drug alone did a little bit but it wasn't great, and the drug that targeted the enzyme that degrades rndocannabinoids basically did nothing alone,\" Krei2er said. \"But when we gave the two together, the animals eally improved dramatically.\" -his work was supported by a Ruth L.

From her clavicles southward, her body is a riot of tattoos-the usual skulls and anchors aqlvell as a large circle with a squiggle inside it on her right arm. (When a visitor points quizzically to the OgSt\", she replies politely, \"It's a baby in a brain,\" though the tone of her voice says, \"Like, duh.\") We shouldn't be misled by the biker look or the faux-'6os talk of changing the world. Robinson is all business- a consummate tradeswoman. In the past 16 months she has found a way to combine her passions for food and pot and make the combination pay, as founder, owner and head baker of Nancy B's Edible Medicine, one of the most successful start-ups in Colorado's newest \"industry\": medical marijuana. (See pictures of Ca_nnabis Culture.) Robinson's muffins and Rice Krispies squares are getting raves. \"I have a very high tolerance,\" said one food critic in the Denver Chronicle, a medical-marijuana blog, \"and a z-dose lemon bar will put me on my ass.\" \"I loved the buzz, which lasted B hours,\" wrote another. \"Very functional and social.\" The growth of Robinson's business has come with the explosion in the number of Colorado's medical-marijuana dispensaries, or centers. Coloradans who are recommended by a doctor and approved by the state go to the centers to buy their pot, either in traditional bud form or as an \"infused product\" like Robinson's lemon bars, which are roo%o organic and laced with a marijuana concentrate. Her success is reflected in the Mile High Macaroons and Cannabis Cups stacked in the new commissary-style kitchen she's rented in the gentrifying neighborhood of City Park West in Denver.o Even with a decent supply of high-grade pot in her walk-in freezer, Robinson can scarcely keep up with demand. She and her two employees (a third is soon to be hired) work six days a week to refine her menu, revise recipes, taste-test hash oil and manage inventory-and still squeeze in time every day to medicate.\"For my ADD,\" she says. \"And some shoulder pain.\" ficatef The medical-marijuana industry relies heavily on such genteel euphemisms. To medicate is to smoke pot, and no one in the industry calls pot pot anymore; it's medicine now. Dealers are called caregivers, and the people who buy their dope-medicine, medicine-are patients. There's no irony here, winks or nudges to signal that someone's leg is being pulled. \"After work,\" says a counter clerk, or budtender, at Briargate Wellness Center, an upscale dispensary serving the tony north side of Colorado Springs, \"I'll just go home, kick back, take out the bong and medicate.\" See pictures of Colorado's marijuana industry. See pictures of stoner cinema. The euphemisms are an important element in the larger movement to bring marijuana use out from the shadows, as advocates say, so it can take its place innocently on Americans' nearly infinite menu of lifestyle preferences, from yachting to survivalism to macrobiotic cooking. So far, the strategy is working. Colorado and 13 other states, along with the District of Columbia, have legalized medical marijuana in the past r4 years. More than a dozen other states are considering the idea. Overnight, dispensaries have sprung up in I -'lreds of towns and cities; billboards touting one outlet's pot over its rivals' are plastered all over Los AFgeles. In some parts of California-where marijuana is the biggest cash crop, with total sales of $r4 billion annually-medical pot has become such an established part of the commercial base that cities are moving toward taxing it. It's not clear that even political setbacks discourage, much less stop, the mainstreaming of marijuana. Anti- pot forces cheered on Nov. z when voters in four states apparently rejected pro-pot ballot initiatives- including California's Prop 19, which would have legalized possession of an ounce (28 g) of pot or less. But by Election Day, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the state legislature had already rendered Prop 19 moot. A month earlier, he signed a bill that reduced possession of up to an ounce from a misdemeanor to a civil infraction. By Jan. r,2oLL,jaywalkers may have more to fear from California cops than potheads do. (See cannabis conventions around the country.) Medical marijuana has helped make all this possible. In a short time, pot has gone from being a prohibited substance to one that is, in many places, widely available if you have an ache or a pain and the patience to fuss with a few forms. This did not take place by accident. In fact, medical marijuana's emergence has many oflhe attributes of a product rollout. As with any hot commodity, dope is now accorded the same awed r||rd in some Colorado retail establishments as fine wine, dark chocolate and artisanal cheese. Only now it takes place under the cover of medical care, wellness and pain management. And so what is emerging in many places is a strange, bipolar set of rules: dope is forbidden for everyone but totally O.K. for anyone whois willing to claim a chronic muscle spasm. Does anyone take such farcical distinctions seriously? And can a backlash be far behind? faHzation via the Clinic Door George Soros, the jillionaire currency trader and patron of countless liberal organizations, began funding pro-legalization groups in the early 199os, with instructions that they redirect their energies toward \"winnable\" issues like medical marijuana. It was a savvy tactic. Even when polls showed strong resistance to making pot legal, large majorities of Americans supported making it available to patients for pain relief. \"If we get medical access, we're going to get legalization eventually,\" activist Richard Cowan said in 1993. \"The cat will be out of the bag.\" Colorado is a good test of wtrether that seemingly inexorable trajectory will remain plausible or prove a pipe dream. Along the regulatory spectrum that stretches from distinctly mellow L.A. to schoolmarmish New Mexico, Colorado sits somewhere near the rniddle. In zooo, Colorado voters approved an amendment to the state constitution to legalize the possession of marijuana for patients suffering from \"debilitating medical conditions\": cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS and multiple sclerosis, slnnptoms like \"severe nausea\" and \"severe pain.\" Voters 20, 54% to 46%.(See the science of pot.') The implementation was based on what is called a caregiver model, Each patient, on the recommendation of ftor, could designate a friend or neighbor to grow up to six plants for the patient's use, and each of these caregivers could provide for no more than five patients. Both patient and caregiver would register with the state. The idea was to prevent profiteering, and from zooo to 2oo7, roughly 2,ooo patients signed up. \"The system worked pretty well,\" says Don Quick, state district attorney for two counties in central Colorado. \"Nobody really had a problem with it.\" But in 2oo7, a pro-pot group called Sensible Colorado sued the state health department, and a state court ruled the five-patient limit unconstitutional. \"That opened the floodgates,\" says Brian Vicente, the group's executive director. \"A caregiver could have 5o patients if they wanted. And if you had 5o patients, why not open a shop?\" Over the next two years, more than t,ooo dispensaries sprang up to serve the more than loo,ooo Coloradans who had suddenly discovered their need for medicinal marijuana and applied for a patient card. As Jon Stewart noted, what had been considered the healthiest state in the country rapidly became one of the sickest. And the economics changed overnight. Patients might spend $Soo a year growing six plants on their own. By contrast, dispensaries routinely charge $gSo to $5oo for t oz. of pot. With patients limited by law to Sssion of no more than z oz., they could easily drop $5,ooo a year on treatment. \"A good-size dispensary will have a few hundred regular customers,\" Quick says. \"You can do the math.\" One who did the math was Joe DiFabio, who fits the mold of the hardy American entrepreneur-if thehardy American entrepreneur sold pot for a living. Now in his ]ate zos, DiFabio ran a construction company and worked in sales before a friend suggested he open a dispensary. He is also a patient, for back pain- ne,aLrly everyone who works in the industry medicates-and he had become disenchanted with the finsaries he'd seen: stoned budtenders, sloppy service, subpar well kept up,\" he says. \"Kind of dirty.\" His business plan was to offer an alternative for the well-heeled professionals in northern Colorado Springs. \"I wanted to have the very best medicine at the lowest prices in town,\" he says, in \"a safe, discreet, professional environment.\" Briargate Wellness Center opened earlier this year, and the plan seems to be working. On a recent weekday afternoon, the three cars in Briargate's parking lot were a Jaguar, a Mercedes and a BMW. DiFabio greets customers in a pressed oxford shirt, trim khakis and polished loafers.

I'm $45,ooo in debt.\" Beyond the waiting room, the medicine sits carefully displayed on a shelf in little vials labeled with rfrable names from a distant, less businesslike era: Mowie Wowie, Couchlock, Atomic Haze-more than zo varieties in all. There are boxes of rolling papers and massed ranks of bongs and vaporizers, a recent innovation that theoretically allows the patient to inhale pot fumes without burning the weed. Pipes made of colorful blown glass have replaced the old metal pipes familiar to an earlier generation of dopers. Marijuana-infused salsa and chips-\"they work phenomenally,\" DiFabio says-are waiting to be washed down with a bottle of Dixie Elixir medicated soda, in your choice of grape, strawberry or orange. Lollipops are in high demand, and gummy bears fly off the shelves. DiFabio's biggest complaints nowadays would warm the heart of a U.S. Chamber of Commerce lobbyist. \"The regulations,\" he says, \"are just over the top.\" His application for a dispensary license ran to L,4oo pages, with attachments. Modern liberalism has always maintained a tension between its libertine and bureaucratic impulses, and in medical marijuana the contradictions collide: the government will let you get as high as you want, but only if you fill out a form first. Would-be patients must obtain a recommendation from a doctor and mail a notarized application and a check for $9o to the state department of health. If they can prove to a budtender that they've applied for a card, they're eligible to buy medicine after 35 days. The card arrives in the mail eventually; the backlog at the health department is nine months and getting longer. For dispensary Qtr and their suppliers-growers and infused-product makers like Robinson-the regulations seem to never end. Alarmed by the sudden efflorescence of dispensaries and customers, the Colorado legislature this summer placed the industry under the regulatory oversight of an official of the state revenue department. Though he's a former cop who busted pot smokers in the r98os, Matt Cook says he approaches his workwith pristine disinterestedness. \"The way I see it,\" he says, \"I regulate widgets. Whatever there is to regulate, that's fine with me.\" (See \"The Great American Pot Smoke-Out.\") C has prepa red, gzpages of proposed regulations modeled on the rules that govern casinos. Dispensary- license fees now run as high as $r8,ooo. Budtenders and owners face strict residency requirements, and anyone with a felony drug conviction is barred from the industry for life. Owners will soon be required to place video cameras throughout their cultivation sites and dispensaries so regulators can log on to the Internet and trace the movement of every marijuana bud from the moment its seeds are planted to the point of sale. The video will be transmitted to a website accessible to regulators round the clock. The regulators dictate where the cameras must be placed and at what angle. DiFabio is particularly irked by a proposal to monitor his marijuana scales by linking them to the Web. \"We've paid our fees,\" he says. \"Why do they have to watch us every second?\" Only in a state where marijuana is almost legal can you find so many Obama voters complaining about Big Government. High? What High? A few facts in particular drove the legislature to tighten the regs this summer. Even Inspector Clouseau mjght have begun to suspect there was more to the industry than medicating the terminally ill. No one 0,, that medical marijuana has brought relief to the state's cancer patients, AIDS sufferers and MS victims. But these aren't the customers the industry is really serving. At the beginning of this year, Colorado health department records show that only z% ofregistered patients had cancer; suffered \"severe pain\"-a catchall condition that can be entirely subjective and difficult for a doctor to measure or verifir. Statewide, more than 7o% of doctor recommendations were written by fewer than 15 physicians. Three out of four patients are men under 4o. This patient profile-young males complaining of chronic pain-has been roughly the same in other medical-marijuana states like Montana and California. See the link between marijuana and schizophrenia. A couple of weekday afternoons spent at several Colorado dispensaries confirms the picture the numbers paint. Nearly all the patients were male, a large majority in their zos and 3os. Figures from other states, though less comprehensive, match Colorado's. Brian Vicente shrugs off the numbers. Young men are more likely to work the kind of jobs that result in chronic pain, he says. \"All this really shows is that pain is more fal\"nt in society than AIDS and cancer.\" Pot affects different people differently-\"We're all our own walking chemistry experiments,\" Robinson likes to say-and for many patients, smoking it or eating it will quickly relieve pain, nausea and muscle spasmsassociated with chemotherapy and MS. Studies have demonstrated beyond quibble that marijuana has some effectiveness in mitigating severe pain. Unfortunately, only clinical tests can show which of marijuana's 1oB active compounds cause which of its many effects, and because the balance of compounds shifts from plant funt, dosage is nearly impossible to control when the medicine is consumed in its botanical state. (See a video on L.A.'s medical marijuana odysselz.) Even activists now concede that marijuana is addictivefor to%o of regular users-making it less addictive than alcohol (tS%) and much less addictive than cigarettes (Sz%), which are, they point out, perfectly legal. Marijuana unquestionably causes cognitive impairment; nobody would smoke it for fun otherwise. Loss of memory and a decline in decisionmaking ability are the most pronounced effects, data confirmed anecdotally and by Cheech and Chong movies. How long the impairment lasts-whether a month or a lifetime-and to what degree are open questions. Use of marijuana has been linked clinically to the onset of depression, anxiety and schizophrenia; the link is especially strong in younger users and stronger still in young men with a predisposition to mental illness. At the same time, budtenders and dispensary owners alike extol pot's bounteous ability to heal in language that is part Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, part Whole Earth Catalog. Forget migraines and insomnia, back pain and lack of appetite: pot is routind sold as a cure for irritable-bowel herpes, diabetes, gonorrhea, bulimia, eczema enough-both obesity and Ona loss. Andrew Weil, the alternative-medicine doctor and holistic-healing guru, suggests marijuana might cure cancer. And what, a laytrlerson might impolitely ask, about thebuzz? Hearing tales of pot's medicinal powers, you would think it was the last thing on anybody's mind. Budtenders will even use air quotes when they speak the word high to nonpatients, as though the stoner effects were an elaborate urban myth.Yet among patients, it's often hard to disentangle the curative and palliative functions of marijuana from the desire to get, if you'll forgive the expression, high. Typical are these patient testimonials from a website run by Montana Caregivers Network: the Romspice variety, says one satisfied customer, \"is the strongest body high I've ever felt. It literally makes my whole body feel numb and tingly. I give it a rz out of ro for pain.\" About AK-47, another testifies, \"A more 'active' high, pretty decent munchie factor after a few minutes and a very pleasant mental haze. Pain relief is definitely also a good plus with this one.\" Here the recreational and medicinal are so balled up that one begins to look like an excuse for the other. Nobody would dare talk this way about Percocet. See how people learn to grow medical marijuana. That's what worries Christian Thurstone, a psychiatrist for adolescents who runs a drug-treatment programin Denver. He cites the confluence of two trends among the city's young. \"There's an increase in the availability of marijuana,\" he says, \"at the same time that we're seeing a decrease in the perceived harmfulness of marijuana.\" His program has seen a marked increase in patient referrals for marijuana use Ohis clinic, where all patients are under rB. \"We've started hearing things we hadn't heard before,\" he says. \"They're telling us that marijuana isn't a drug, that it's a medicine. They even call it medicine.\" To register as a medical-marijuana patient, a minor must submit the notarized signatures of both parents to the Colorado board of health. Even so, Thurstone says, when he collected data on 55 juvenile marijuana patients, he found that 6o% of them had gotten their pot from a patient with a medical-marijuana card. \"This age is a crucial developmental window for these teenagers, particularly young males,\" he says. He cites studies that suggest marijuana use in adolescence doubles the risk of schizophrenia in later life. \"The human costs are potentially huge.\" Meanwhile, a national survey on drug use and health reports that the percentage of kids under 17 using marijuana has been rising-from 6.7% in zoo3 to 7.g% last year. (See The Backlash Cometh For all its success, there are signs that the advance of the medical-marijuana movement is not inevitable. ft narrow losses for initiatives in South Dakota and, apparently, Arizona, despite lavish funding on their Ellalf, were discouraging to advocates, who are ordinarily quite cheerful-no surprise there-and upbeat about the prospects for their cause. The Los Angeles city council recently moved to reduce the number of local dispensaries from an estimated t,ooo to roughly zoo. The New Jersey legislature passed a medical- dope law in January far more stringent than the one activists hoped for. Only terminally ill patients or those with cancer or ALS will be permitted to buy marijuana from a handful of state-sponsored clinics. New Mexico's law, passed in zoo7, will prohibit the private cultivation of marijuana, which will be available only through the state government's own \"cannabis-production facilities.\" Meanwhile, at the federal level, it's still 1985. Marijuana retains its status as a Schedule r controlled substance, the legal equivalent of heroin and LSD, with \"a high potential for abuse\" and. \"no currently accepted medical use.\" That designation sharply limits the medical research that can be done with marijuana, setting up a flawless bureaucratic catch-zz: pot is listed as Schedule r because science hasn't found an accepted medical use for it, but science can't find a medical use for it because it's listed as Schedule r. Either Congress or the Drug Enforcement Administration could change the designation, but the DEA shows no signs of budging, and when Representative Barney Frank introduced a bill two years ago torlmifV marijuana for medical research, he gathered all of four original co-sponsors. The high hopes that advocates once had for the Obama Administration have faded too. During the presidential campaign, Barack Obama promised to de-emphasize federal prosecution of medical-marijuanaviolations, and Attorney General Eric Holder formalized the policy with a memo to U.S. Attorneys in September 2oo9. ftt was a short honeymoon. Last January, Obama stunned the movement by reappointing George W. Bush's DEA acting administrator, Michele Leonhardt, who has an uncompromising approach to marijuana. This year, the DEA has made a series of raids on medical-marijuana facilities in Nevada, Michigan and California, claiming the operations were simply fronts for conventional drug dealing. When a federal survey last month showed a surge in pot smoking among young people, Obama's drug czar, R. Gil Kerlikowske, was quick to finger medical-marijuana laws as the culprit. \"I think all of the attention and the focus of calling marijuana medicine has sent the absolute wrong message to young people,\" Kerlikowske said. For the marijuana movement, the Obama era has been all hope and no change. (See inside Colorado's marijuana industry.l If nothing else, technology may make medical marijuana obsolete. Mark A.R. Kleiman, a specialist in drug policy at UCLA, says it's inevitable that some form of measurable, dosable medical marijuana will be made available in the next few years, a medicine that comes not in plant form but in a spray or an inhaler. \"And that will do away with the argument for medical marijuana as we know it,\" he says. Already Canada and the U.K. have approved the use of Sativex, a cannibis-based spray for the nose and mouth that was developed by GW Pharmaceuticals, and it's in late-stage testing in the U.S. Sativex has been effective for pain from MS 1Jms and cancer treatment without causing the marijuana high. The moment Sativex goes on the market, tFneed for medical dispensaries, caregivers and growers-and all the confusions and prevarications that attend them-disappears. There's a rough justice here: the disingenuousness of the push for medical marijuana-billed as a compassionate reform and used as a tactic toward full legalization-was always its Achilles' heel. Up to now, most states have approached medical marijuana with a series of evasions. Doctors rely on a patient's report of pain to recommend it, dispensaries rely on the word of doctors to sell it, regulators rely on legislators to determine who can provide it, and legislators fall back on public opinion, which is ill suited to making careful and informed decisions about pharmacology. And no one takes direct responsibility. None dare call it legalization. There is another way to go about it. \"If we want to legalize marijuana,\" said Thurstone, \"then let's legalize marijuana and call it a day. Let's not sneak it in the back door, dragging the medical system into it.\" U, at least, Thurstone finds an unexpected ally in Jenelise Robinson. Going through boxes of her new Pu=ff Potion medicated soda ($6 a bottle wholesale), she reflects on the oddity of the culture that medical marijuana has created in her state. \"It seems silly, doesn't it?\" she says. \"If there's someone who's been smoking for a long time, medicating, and this is what they like to do and this is what works for them, thenwhy can't they just do it? Why make them go to the doctor and register? Why force them to lie about it?\" Ferguson is a senior editor at the Weekly Standard.

Cannabis can cause short-term psychotic experiences, such as hallucinations and paranoia, even in healthy people, but researchers have also long noted a link between marijuana use and the chronic psychotic disorder, schizophrenia. Rqeatedly, studies have found that people with schizophrenia are about twice as likely to smoke pot as ,O *no ur\" unaffected. Conversely, data suggest that those who smoke cannabis are twice as likd to develop schizophrenia as nonsmokers. One widely publicized 2oo7 review of the research even concluded that trying marijuana just once was associated with a 4o%o increase in risk of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. (See photos of cannabis conventions around the country.) But here's the conundrum: while marijuana went from being a secret shared by a small community of hepcats and beatniks in the r94os and '5os to a rite of passage for some 7o% of youth by the turn of the century, rates of schizophrenia in the U.S. have remained flat, or possibly declined. For as long as it has been tracked, schizophrenia has been found to affect about t% of the population. (See a photoessay on a father with mental illness.) One explanation may be that the two factors are coincidental, not causal: perhaps people who have a genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia also happen to especially enjoy marijuana. Still, some studies suggest that smoking pot can actually trigger the disease earlier in individuals who are predisposed, and yet researchers still aren't seeing increases in the overall schizophrenia rate or decreases in the average age of onset.o In recent months, new research has explored some of these issues. One study led by Dr. Serge Sevy, an associate professor of psychiatry at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, looked at roo patients between the ages of 16 and 4o with schizophrenia, half of whom smoked marijuana. Sevy andcolleagues found that among the marijuana users, 75%hadbegun smoking before the onset of schizophrenia and that their disease appeared about two years earlier than in those who did not use the drug. But when the researchers controlled for other factors known to influence schizophrenia risk, including fr\"r, education and socioeconomic status, the association between disease onset and marijuana disappeared. (See TIME's special on preventing mental illness disorders.) Gender alone accounted for a large proportion of the risk of early onset in Sevy's study, which included 69 men and 31 women. \"Males in general have earlier age of onset of schizophrenia,\" says Sevy. In men, the disease tends to take hold around age 19, while in women it isn't typically seen until 22 - irrespective of marijuana use. But, typically, teenage boys are four times more likely than girls to be heavy pot smokers, which may create an illusory association between the drug and onset of the disease. Yet past studies limited to males have found exactly such a link, associating marijuana use with earlier development of full-blown psychosis. And other research has found that ongoing cannabis use increases hospitalizations for psychotic symptoms in schizophrenic patients and decreases social and cognitive functioning. A zoo8 review of the data found that relapse and failure to take prescribed medication was consistently associated with cannabis use, although, again, controlling for other factors weakened the link. One explanation could be that the effects of marijuana vary depending on the genetics of the individual O*= schizophrenia. Marie-Odile Krebs, professor of psychiatry at the National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) laboratory in France, and her colleagues published a study in June that identified two broad groups of people with schizophrenia who used cannabis: those whose disease was profoundly affected by their drug use and those who were not. Within Krebs's study population of r9o patients (rzr of whom had used cannabis), researchers found a subgroup of 44 whose disease was powerfully affected by the drug. These patients either developed schizophrenia within a month of beginning to smoke pot or saw their existing psychosis severely exacerbated with each successive exposure to the drug. Schizophrenia appeared in these patients nearly three years earlier than in other marijuana-users with the disease. See photos of the great American pot smoke-out. Read about how to grow medical marijuana. The key difference between the cannabis-sensitive patients and the nonaffected group was a family history offease: those in the former group had three times the number of close relatives with psychotic disorders, sffXrebs. Further, the sensitive group started smoking pot at a younger age - before age L7, compared with 18 in patients without marijuana sensitivity - and Krebs thinks the early exposure may have critically altered the development of brain receptors affected by marijuana.These receptors, known as endocannabinoid receptors, affect the action of the brain's dopamine systems, fine-tuning the response of the neurons involved. Although this process is not yet completely understood, fSinS the way endocannabinoids influence dopamine during development could result in a chronically high level of dopamine in some regions of the brain, which may increase the likelihood of psychotic episodes. Stimulant drugs such as amphetamine and cocaine, which increase the action of the dopamine system, for instance, are known to produce psychotic experiences, while antipsychotic drugs work by blocking the brain's dopamine receptors. (Does teen drug rehab cure addjgtion or create it?) Given that an estimated So% of the risk for schizophrenia is attributable to genes and family history, disseminating the results of research like Iftebs's could help delay the onset of disease in thousands of people and prevent years of severe disability in those with a family history of schizophrenia. Although the disease itself affects only t% of the population, about to% ofhealthy people have personality features that, when intensified, ffi&y characterize schizophrenia - such as paranoia - meaning that the proportion of the population who may be sensitive to marijuana could be larger than expected, Krebs says. (See a brief history of medical marijuana.) However, discouraging marijuana use in patients who have schizophrenia or are at high risk of developing it is a complicated task, not least because the drug is extremely popular with this group. Their affinity for the d; mal be related to a phenomenon recently described in a study published in the British Journal of N{chiatry: The research tracked the moods of Bo marijuana smokers, 4z of whom had psychotic disorders like schizophrenia. Participants were asked to record their moods at various points over the course of six days, determined by a watch that beeped periodically to signal the volunteers. All participants, not surprisingly, reported feeling happier when they were high, but the mood-lifting effect of marijuana was stronger among smokers with schizophrenia. Unlike people without the disease, schizophrenia patients also reported a reduction in negative feelings after smoking marijuana. \"Everyone feels better,\" explains lead author Cecile Henquet, an assistant professor of psychology and psychiatry at Maastricht University in Holland. \"But [schizophrenia] patients also have less anxiety and are less socially withdrawn.\" But which is the chicken and which is the egg? In another study by Sevy at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, researchers interviewed adults with schizophrenia (and their families) who smoked marijuana, and found that they reported being better adjusted during childhood than those who did not indulge. It makes sense when you consider the practicalities and social nature of drug use. Being at least somewhat socially connected is necessary to be able to obtain an illegal drug - if you appear too \"crazy,\" people are less likely to befriend you and dealers may be too wary to sell to you. Many people with schizophrenia .1Jn odd behavior that puts them at risk for social rejection years before they develop full-blown de'lfsions and hallucinations in adulthood. (See a video on home delivery of medical marijuana. The access issue may also help explain why some studies find better - not worse - cognitive functioning inpeople with schizophrenia who smoke marijuana. That's what Pamela DeRosse, a research scientist at Long Island's Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, and her colleagues found in a study of 455 people with schizophrenia published in Schizophrenio. Researchin July. The research showed that patients who smoked ,rfouru had faster brain processing speed, greater verbal ability and better memory than patients who didn't smoke - not attributes usually associated with being high. \"I can't really tell you why they aren't doing worse,\" says DeRosse. \"But in order to go out to even find cannabis, enough to become dependent or abuse it, requires that you be more cognitively intact than the average patient with schizophrenia.\" Indeed, many schizophrenia patients who smoke pot smoke enough to become addicted. As Henquet's study showed, the drug's mood-boosting effects appear immediatd after smoking, as do some hallucinations, but the bulk of negative marijuana-related effects appear later on, as an increased rate of hallucination that affects patients even when they are not high. This is the exact type of drug effect that raises addiction risk: The user's experience is one of short-term gain associated with the drug, with long- term pain that seems unrelated. \"This is what explains why patients with schizophrenia use cannabis for longer and more frequently than controls,\" says Henquet. \"They are apparently more sensitive to the addictive potential than other people.\" That marijuana can have such incompatible effects in schizophrenia patients - enhancing mood while exacerbating hallucinations and delusions - is not surprising, when its chemical makeup is considered. One fi\"ut called delta-g tetrahydocannabinol (THC) is known to cause hallucinations and in high doses can even make healthy people feel paranoid or suffer brief attacks of psychosis. But another component of marijuana called cannabidiol (CBD) has anti-psychotic effects. Consequently, researchers who study the knotty relationship between drug use and schizophrenia hope that patients may one day benefit from cannabis-derived drugs. The key is to replicate the antipsychotic properties of CBD without triggering the risks carried by THC. But in the meantime, scientists are still trj'rng to identify which patients, based on genes and family history, may be most helped by potential new pharmaceutical drugs and who may be spared harm by avoiding illicit drug use now.
