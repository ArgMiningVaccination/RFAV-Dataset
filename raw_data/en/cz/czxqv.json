Energy Deregulation Legislatures and the public utility commissions (PUCs) of many states have created competition for electricity and natural gas supply. With competition, generation is separated from transmission and distribution. This allows consumers to choose their energy supplier, while the delivery of the energy is still regulated and is the responsibility of the local utility company. Energy deregulation enables public agencies to shop for the best price of energy just as they do for their other products and services. With these benefits comes the task of competitively procuring these energy commodities, which takes a thorough understanding of the markets and the suppliers. This is where Tradition Energy is here to help. Success Stories with OMNIA Partners With its energy contract managed by the State, Hillsborough did not have the market transparency or understanding of how its natural gas rates were being determined. As a result of the competitive procurement process involving all-natural gas suppliers, Hillsborough achieved a new rate that reduced its costs by 41% versus their previous contract and saved the District more than $540,000. Athens Housing Authority in Georgia was paying an average of $300,000 annually in natural gas costs to fuel over 1000 residences. Tradition Energy's advisor worked with the Athens Housing Authority to evaluate their historical procurement practices and identify new opportunities to improve supplier competition and procurement timing.
