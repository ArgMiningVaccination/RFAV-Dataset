Fewer infections means less chance of dangerous variants. - The [Canadian Pediatric Society recommends](https://caringforkids.cps.ca/handouts/immunization/covid-19-vaccine-for-children)eligible children be vaccinated. While kids have a lower risk of severe illness, vaccines offer the best protection from getting COVID-19. Immunity - The COVID-19 virus emerged in late 2019, and no one had pre-existing immunity. - Immunity for people who have had COVID-19 may not last long. Child cases in Alberta - Find information on [COVID-19 cases in children in Alberta](https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm#characteristics). - Most COVID-19 cases in children are mild, but some kids can get very sick, have long-lasting symptoms (Long COVID), or complications such as - Vaccine safety Approval process - All vaccines approved in Canada undergo a rigorous [review and approval process](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/covid-19-vaccine-treatment.html)to ensure they are safe and effective. Side effects - It's normal to have minor side effects after vaccination - it's a sign your immune system is responding to the vaccine. [Common side effects](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/vaccination-children/safety-concerns-side-effects.html)include muscle aches, fatigue, mild fever, and pain at the injection site. Adverse effects - Once a vaccine is in use, Alberta Health, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada all monitor Canadian and international adverse events following immunization. Health Canada also publishes information and counts of all COVID-19 adverse events following immunization. - Overall, serious side effects from vaccination are rare. 99.98% of vaccines administered in Alberta to date had no serious side effects. - Very rare cases of inflammation of the heart muscle and lining surrounding the heart ( [myocarditis and pericarditis](/system/files/custom_downloaded_images/health-myocarditis-and-pericarditis-following-covid.pdf)) have been reported across all age groups, although this side effect is more common in adolescents and young adults. The cases are typically mild and are treatable. Myocarditis is far more likely after COVID-19 infection than after vaccination. Severe allergies - The vaccines do not contain egg, latex or preservatives. - The only time someone should not get a COVID-19 vaccine is if they are severely allergic to [specific ingredients in the vaccine.](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/pfizer-biontech.html#a4)Speak to your doctor if you have questions about your child's allergies.

COVID-19 can rarely also cause death in children. - Children can also spread the virus to others, even when they don't have symptoms. - Getting the vaccine is the best way to protect your child. How many children get infected with COVID-19? - Find information on [COVID-19 cases in Alberta by age group](https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm#characteristics). Why is natural immunity not adequate protection? - While having had COVID-19 offers some protection, it may not last very long. - Getting all the vaccine doses your child is eligible for offers the best protection. What are the common side effects in children? - The COVID-19 vaccines are well tolerated in children. Most side effects are mild and are a sign the immune system is responding to the vaccine. - These side effects include pain at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, chills, joint and muscle pain, and fever. What is the risk of heart problems after vaccination? - Reports of myocarditis and pericarditis (heart inflammation) after vaccination are rare.

All approved vaccines are safe, effective and continue to play a role in preventing COVID-19 infection and limiting its spread. More importantly, these vaccines help prevent serious illness from COVID-19 infection. You're encouraged to review current evidence to make an informed decision about your health. COVID-19 vaccines can be given at the same time, before or after the influenza vaccine and other routine immunizations to individuals 6 months of age or older. - mRNA COVID-19 vaccines The mRNA vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) are proven highly effective in preventing serious illness and death. Who should get the mRNA vaccines - The bivalent mRNA vaccines are available as primary series for individuals 6 months and older and as booster doses to eligible individuals 5 years and older. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) preferentially recommends that individuals 12 to 29 years of age get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as the rare risk of myocarditis is lower when compared to the Moderna vaccine. Who shouldn't get the mRNA vaccines - Consult your doctor if you have questions about your health conditions. How mRNA vaccines work - The vaccines use [mRNA technology](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/type-mrna.html)to teach cells how to make a protein to trigger an immune response and make antibodies to fight the COVID-19 virus. It does not alter your DNA. Possible side effects - Pain at injection site, body chills, feeling tired or feverish are common. - Allergic reactions are rare. - No major safety concerns have been identified. - Rare cases of heart inflammation (known as myocarditis and pericarditis) after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine have been reported internationally and in Canada. Investigations are ongoing. These are cases are rare, treatable, and typically mild. - As of July 26, 2023, there have been 112 reported cases of myocarditis in Alberta out of more than 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines administered. - Current evidence suggests a likely causal association between myocarditis and the mRNA vaccines. - Learn more: [Myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccines](/system/files/custom_downloaded_images/health-myocarditis-and-pericarditis-following-covid.pdf)(PDF, 444 KB) - The bivalent mRNA vaccines are available as primary series for individuals 6 months and older and as booster doses to eligible individuals 5 years and older. - Novavax vaccine (currently not available) The [Novavax](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/novavax.html)COVID-19 vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine (non-mRNA vaccine) proven effective in preventing serious illness and death in adults from COVID-19 infection. - A complete primary series with an mRNA vaccine is preferentially recommended. Who should get it - Novavax is a non-mRNA vaccine authorized for use for individuals aged 12 years and older who cannot receive or refuse an mRNA vaccine. - Due to limited quantities, call Health Link at 811 to book an appointment at select locations across Alberta. Who shouldn't get it - Not currently authorized for people under 12 years of age. How it works [Protein subunit vaccines](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/protein-subunit.html)use purified COVID-19 spike proteins to stimulate your immune system to produce antibodies that will protect you against COVID-19. Possible side effects - Pain at injection site, body chills, feeling tired or feverish are common. - Allergic reactions are rare. As with any medication, you should contact your health-care provider if you experience any health concerns. - What's the difference? All vaccines help our bodies learn how to protect us against future infection from the virus that causes COVID-19, but use a different mechanism to get the attention of the immune system: - The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines use mRNA technology to teach cells how to make a protein to trigger an immune response and make antibodies to fight the real virus. It does not alter your DNA. - The Novavax vaccine uses purified COVID-19 spike proteins to stimulate your immune system to produce antibodies that will protect you against COVID-19. After your vaccine, it's normal to have some minor side effects like fever or aches that go away on their own after a few days. As with all medicines, there's also a small chance that there will be a serious side effect like an allergic reaction, so it is important to stay for monitoring at the place you get your vaccine for 15 minutes after being vaccinated. Some very rare reactions after COVID-19 vaccines include: - mRNA vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech): Rare cases of [myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and/or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining around the heart)](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/vaccines/safety-side-effects.html#a5)have been reported after receiving an mRNA vaccine. - Protein subunit vaccine (Novavax): 2 cases of myocarditis following a second dose of Novavax vaccine were reported during a clinical trial, but current information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. - Vaccine effectiveness against Omicron Need help booking your appointment?
