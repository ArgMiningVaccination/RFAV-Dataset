Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019- CoV), which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. Vaccines are a powerful tool to counter infectious diseases threats with pandemic potential. The development of the experimental vaccines requires a plethora of molecular techniques as well as strict compliance with safety procedures. The research and clinical data integrity, cross validation of the results, and appropriated studies from the perspective of efficacy and potency side effects have recently become a hotly discussed topic [2]. In the article The 2020 race towards SARS-CoV2 specific vaccines written by Tomasz Karpinski et al, they present an update on latest advances and progress in an ongoing race to develop 52 different vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, focusing on registered clinical trials until November 04, 2020 that fulfill the international safety and efficacy criteria in the vaccine development. And there are more 103 preclinical candidates to vaccines. The vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 should meet at least the following requirements: 1. Minimi ze undesired immune potentiation; 2. Be suitable for adult healthcare workers; 3. Be suitable for adults > 60 years old or with underlying diabetes or hypertension; 4. And be suitable for long-term stockpiling; These 52 vaccines include 13 protein subunit candidates, 11 non- replicating viral vector vaccines, 6 inactivated, 6 RNA and 4 DNA vaccines, 4 replicating viral vectored, 2 virus-like protein (VLP), and 6 others. Between the preclinical candidates, 55 were protein subunit, 19 non-replicating viral vector, 19 RNA, 17 replicating viral vector, 15 VLP, 13 DNA, 12 inactivated, 3 live attenuated and 2 others. There are advantages and disadvantages to each vaccine platforms. Viral vector vaccines exhibit potential risk such as chromosomal integration and oncogenesis, and generally cannot be used in immunocompromised subjects. Protein vaccines need adjuvants to enhance immunological response. At the same time global scale deployment of attenuated Huang WL, J Vaccines Res Vaccin 2021, 7: 018 DOI: 10.24966/VRV-0193/100018 HSOA Journal of Vaccines Research and Vaccination Research Article Huang WL* Infectious Diseases, General Practice, Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition Doctor, Acupuncture and Pain Management specialist. Medical Acupuncture and Pain Management Clinic, Franca, S\u00e3o Paulo, BrazilAre We Vaccinating Immunocompetent or Immunocompromised People for COVID 19? Abstract Introduction: Since January 2020, Chinese scientists shared the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence and approximately, 321 research groups begin the search for vaccine since then. The CDC notes that immunocompromised patients may receive the vaccines so long as they have no contraindications to vaccination, but that they should be counseled about the unknown safety profiles of the vaccines in immunocompromised populations. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the majority of the patients that the author is attending nowadays is in the category of immune compromised patients. Methods: The author did radiesthesia procedure to measure the energy of the seven chakra of 1000 patients during 2015 to 2020. Doing this measurement, the author was measuring the energy of the five massive organs in traditional Chinese medicine, responsible for the production of energy Yin, Yang, Qi and Blood, important to maintenance of health and the immune system in the human body and the production of Zheng-Qi, that is responsible for the protection of the body against the invasion of external pathogenic factor, in this case SARS-CoV-2. Results: The result of this study is that more than 97 percent of the patients analyzed were in the lowest level of energy, meaning that their immune system are compromised because energy in TCM means immune system. Conclusion: The conclusion of this study is that we are vaccinating immunecompromised people and not immunecompetent for COVID 19. In the group of patients studied by the author, more than 90% of the patients have no energy in the chakras' energy centers that corresponds to no energy in the five massive organs in traditional Chinese medicine, responsible for the production of Yin, Yang, Qi and Blood to maintenance of health and immune system. Keywords: Chakra; COVID Immunocompetent or for COVID 19? J Vaccines Res Vaccin 7: 018. Page 2 of 10 J Vaccines Res Vaccin ISSN: 2573-0193, Open Access Journal DOI: 10.24966/VRV-0193/100018 Volume 7 Issue 1 100018vaccines is always associated with risks of pathogen reactivation and regaining its virulence in the future. At present every vaccine technology represents a compromise between good efficacy, safety, and a lack of side-effects [3]. According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in United States two vaccines are authorized and recommended to prevent COVID-19: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, these both vaccines are made by RNA [4]. According to CDC, these two vaccines are indicated to all the population over 18 years of age except for those who had allergic reactions to polysorbate or any other component of the vaccine, as well as allergic reactions after the first dose [5]. Immunocompromised individuals can receive COVID-19 vaccination if they have no contraindications to vaccination. However, they should be counseled about the vaccine's unknown safety profile and efficacy in immunocompromised populations, as well as the potential for reduced immune responses and the need to continue to follow all current guidelines to protect against COVID-19. Antibody testing is not recommended to assess immunity to COVID-19 after vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA [6]. In this article, the author will bring to you a different point of view about the population we have nowadays in our world. She will follow what Hippocrates said in one of his quotes that \"it is more important consider other ancient medical traditions prior the knowledge we have nowadays\", so the author will show to you if the population is immunocompetent or immunocompromised in the energy point of view using traditional Chinese medicine and other ancient medical tools. Chinese medicine never discusses immunity directly. Instead it describes the clinical symptoms of the body's response to an invasion by external pathogens in terms of Zheng Qi, vital Qi, which protects human health by fending off invasion [7]. In the editorial entitled Acupuncture and Immunity written by Fengxia Liang et al (2015), they showed that more and more research has revealed that acupuncture can regulate immunity, for example, to enhance anticancer and anti-stress immune function and exert anti-inflammation effects. This may be the basis of acupuncture in preventing and treating later diseases. Moreover, TCM focuses on the theory that prevention before the onset of the diseases or intervening in an early stage of diseases is much better than treating after the onset [8]. Purpose To demonstrate that patients that we are vaccinating nowadays are in the immune compromise category and not immunocompetent. Methods To better understand the type of people we have nowadays the author did a research in her clinic in Brazil between 2015 and April of 2020 measuring the energy of her patients' chakras' energy centers through the radiesthesia procedure. This method of measuring energy is done using a crystal pendulum, positioned in front of each chakra (First to seventh), followed by the analysis of the pendulum movements, to measure the energy. The energy of the chakras was evaluated in a scale of one to eight (one representing the lowest level, and eight the normal level). The author measured the chakras' energy centers of 1000 patients, but she was only able to analyze and compile the files of 409 patients. To understand why the author used this kind of reasoning to explain this process, she will show you the tree metaphor that she usually uses in all her publications in diverse pathologies and diseases process. This tree has a trunk with several branches, each branch represents one medical specialty. And coming out of each branch, you can see many leaves. Each leave represents the symptoms and diseases treated by each medical specialty. But in this tree has the root, and is not usually visible by the naked eyes, so Western medicine do not recognize it is existence because is it invisible. But traditional Chinese medicine understood that all signs and symptoms and diseases comes from the imbalances on internal energy in the root, generated by the emotions and wrong eating habits and also, could be the influences of the external pathogenic factor, that are surrounding this tree, as you can see in the (Figure 1). To demonstrate if the patients nowadays are considered immunocompromised or immunocompetent, the author will show the results of the analysis of the energy of the five elements on the root of the tree, that usually are not visible by the naked eyes. Results The results of this research, the author divided in three groups. The first group was patients that have no energy in any chakra energy center, corresponding to 69% percent of the total, with exception of the seventh chakra that was normal, rated in eight. You can see this result on the (Figure 2 and Table 1). The patients were divided in three groups by age, from 2 to 19, 20 to 59 and 60 to 80. In the table one, representing 69 percent of the patients studied, is showing that they had no energy from chakras 1 to 6, but had energy on the seventh chakra, which is the spiritual chakra. In all the age groups, looking at the Western medicine diagnosis, the anxiety appeared as one of the main diagnosis in all three groups, following by headache in the young adults (20-59 years) and knee Figure 2: Demonstration of the results of the chakras' energy measurement in the group 1.Figure 1: Metaphor of the tree comparing Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine's point of view.

On the other hand, looking by the point of view of traditional Chinese medicine, the main energies imbalances in the teenagers group (2-19 years) were deficiency of Yin and Yang, in the young adults group (20-59 years) was deficiency of Yin and in the older patients group (60-80 years) were Yin deficiency, Yin and internal Heat, Yin and Yang deficiency with internal Heat, as you can see in: (Table 1). The second group of the patient, demonstrated in the (Figure 3 and Table 2), is representing almost 20% of the patients studied, that had no energy in any of the chakras from 1 to 7. In Western medicine anxiety is a common diagnosis for the three groups, and in the young adults' (20-59 years) low back pain is common, and on the older patients (60-80 years) is knee pain. The more common energies imbalances among children and teenagers (2-19 years) were deficiency of Yin, Qi and internal Heat. In young adults' (20-59 years) deficiency of Yin and Yang with formation of internal Heat were more common. In older patients (60-80 years) were Yin deficiency with formation of internal Heat. In these three groups, the formation of internal Heat is a common factor, as you can see in the (Table 2). The 11 % that aren't in these tables also had lack of energy in some organs, but some had normal energy yet, as showed in the (Table 3). The results highlighted in blue symbolizes the results that has energy in the second chakra or the Kidney, which represents the Zheng-Qi in TCM. ST means self-steam. In this table, the author is showing the various combinations of energy found in the measurement of the remaining 11 percent of the patients analyzed. According to this data, you can see that there are patients that has energy in some chakra, that corresponds to energy in some massive organ in TCM, but what the author wants to emphasize in this table is that only 2,59% of the total of the patients analyzed have Zheng-Qi, that corresponds to the energy in the Kidney, represented by the second chakra.

The remaining patients do not have energy in the second chakra that corresponds to 97,41% of the total patients analyzed do not have Zheng-Qi. Discussion In Western medical theory, the immune system has a defensive function; the cells of the immune system work together with different proteins to seek out and destroy anything foreign or dangerous that enters the body [9]. According to Andrea Cortegiani et al in the article Immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: secondary analysis of the LUNG SAFE database, \"immunocompromised\" patients are defined as all patients with at least one of the following conditions: Immunosuppression (defined as viral immunosuppression, neoplastic disease, immunosuppressive drugs including steroids, chemotherapy, or congenital immunosuppression); Active hematologic malignancy (i.e., still requiring treatment) Active neoplasm (i.e., a neoplasm that has not been resected, still requires treatment, or with metastasis). Patients without these conditions were classified as \"immunocompetent\" [10]. According to the Canadian Immunization Guide, immunocompromised people are more susceptible to vaccine- preventable infections and may have severe infections. The safety and effectiveness of vaccines in immunocompromised people are determined by the type of immunodeficiency and degree of immunosuppression. Each immunocompromised person is different and presents unique considerations regarding immunization. The relative degree of immunodeficiency is variable depending on the underlying condition, the progression of disease and use of immunosuppressive agents. Immunodeficiency can also vary over time in many people and the decision to recommend for or against a particular vaccine will depend upon a case-by-case analysis of the risks and benefits. There is potential for serious illness and death if immunocompromised people are under-immunized and every effort should be made to ensure adequate protection through immunization; however, inappropriate use of live vaccines can cause serious adverse events in some immunocompromised people as a result of uncontrolled replication of the vaccine virus or bacterium [11]. Traditional Chinese medicine literature understand Zheng Qi as the ability of the organism to protect itself from the influences of the external pathogenic factors, exposed in the tree metaphor, shown in the (Figure 1), as well as the ability of the organism to recover after damaging influences or energy imbalances caused by emotional distress or a bad eating habits. Zheng Qi is formed with the constitutional energy of the Kidney meridian (second chakra) and is part inherited from the parents and part acquired from diet. TCM refers to all pathogenic factors as malicious energy or Xie Qi [13]. There are some studies found in the literature, correlating the chakras' energy centers and the five massive organs in the Five Elements theory. The article entitled The Geometry of Emotions: Using Chakra Acupuncture and 5-Phase Theory to Describe Personality Archetypes for Clinical Use, written by Chase C.R. (2018), he is explaining that there are some correspondence between five elements and the chakras' energy centers [12-30]. For this reason, when measuring the chakras' energy centers, the author is measuring the energy of the five massive organs in TCM because each organ has their own energy function inside the body. Each chakra corresponds to the functioning of one of the massive organ (Liver, Heart, Spleen, Lung and Kidney) in the theory of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese medicine and each massive organ is responsible for the functioning of one sensorial external organ eyes - vision (Liver), tongue - communication (Heart), mouth - taste (Spleen), nose - sense of smell (Lung), ears - hearing (Kidney) and production of Yin, Yang (Kidney - second chakra), Qi (Liver - first chakra and Lung - fourth chakra) and Blood (Spleen - fifth chakra and Heart - third chakra) as the author published it in several article of her and the correspondence can be seen in the (Table 4) [12-31]. In this article, the author is showing that the five massive organs inside the body of her patients were in the lowest level, meaning that they are not working appropriately to keep their functions. For example, the fifth chakra that is responsible for the absorption of nutrients do not have energy to work, for this reason, the patient is not absorbing the foods that they are eating and for this reason, the production of Blood is also compromised, leading to weak state of all organs and tissue that depends on the Blood to supply their energy. In this case, the fifty chakra represents the door for entrance of energy to other chakra, like in the case of the Lung energy or fourth chakra, that is responsible for the respiratory energy of entrance of oxygen inside the body, that in this case is also compromised, due to the lack of energy in this meridian too, that is responsible for the distribution of energy inside the body, together with the first chakra, that is the Liver energy, that is also compromised. To Blood flow adequately inside the body, it is necessary the energy of Yin and Yang and also Qi, that the author is demonstrating in this article, that all the internal organs that are responsible for the production of these energies are all in the lowest level of power, meaning that they are more prompt to have complications because all the disease are formed by these energy imbalances, that the author is demonstrating in many articles published by her regarding the formation of many diseases [12-31]. In this study, the author is showing that 97, 41% of her patients do not have Zheng-Qi, that is the energy that prevents the entrance of the external pathogenic factor inside the body. In this case SARS-CoV-2 infection is considered invasion of the external pathogenic factor, as the author presented in many webinars during 2020, as in the Webinar of allergy and infectious disease on October 2020, among many others. The article entitled Energy Alterations and Chakras' Energy Deficiencies and Propensity to SARS-CoV-2 Infection , published by the Acta Scientific Microbiology on March 2021, the author is demonstrating the traditional Chinese medicine\u00b4s point of view in relation to development of COVID 19 [1,28,32]. Nowadays, the majority are in the last situation described on the right (gravity) in the (Figure 4). The appearance of disease results from a fight between these two factors, Zheng Qi and Xie Qi. This conflict could be in three different ways: normality when Zheng Qi is stronger than Xie Qi, empty when Zheng Qi is weak but less weak than Xie Qi and gravity when Zheng Qi is real and much lower than Xie Qi [33]. In this study, the author demonstrates that the Zheng Qi of 97, 41% of her patients were compromised, due to lack of energy in the second chakra (Kidney) in all the three groups.Citation: Huang WL (2021) Are We Vaccinating Immunocompetent or for COVID 19?

For this reason, the production of Yin and Yang that is produced by the Kidney energy is compromised and also, the Blood by the fifth chakra (Spleen) and also, the Qi, that is distributed by the fourth chakra (Lung) and first chakra (Liver) is also in the lowest level of energy .Traditional Chinese medicine comprehends diseases and symptoms as reflexes of imbalances in the energy flow. Everything in the world is formed by energy, including the human body. Traditional Chinese medicine considers that different energy inside the body have to be maintained in balance for achieving a state of health. These energies are Yin, Yang, Qi and Blood, and different aspects and behaviors can influence the body, like emotions, diet and external factors. This relationship between these four forces can be seen in the (Figure 5). The internal Heat is formed when is some energy deficiencies between Yin or Yang or Qi or/and Blood or a combination of them. This energy created by this deficiency is responsible for the manifestation of many diseases in the leaf level of the tree such as anxiety, inflammatory conditions, urticarial, infections, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, etc., [12-29]. In the article Energy Alterations and Chakras' Energy Deficiencies and Propensity to SARS-CoV-2 Infection , the author is explaining that some patients that is acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infections have Heat retention prior to the diagnosis of COVID-19 and that is why, they all have inflammatory process inside their body before acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection that could aggravate their inflammatory situation depending on the type of medication that they could be receiving, because could harm or not their internal energy balance state and worse the production of Heat, leading to increased level of cytokines diagnosed in Western medicine, in the second and third phase of the infection, but actually caused by the production of internal Heat, in the energy level [32,34]. In the article SARS-CoV-2 infection: The role of cytokines in COVID-19 disease, written by Ruiz et al (2020), the authors are reviewing the alterations found in patients that need to be admitted in the intensive care unit and their alterations in the expression on the cytokines [34]. In the article Can Hospital Osteomyelitis Be Treated Without the Use of Antibiotics?, written by the author and published in 2018, she is demonstrating in two cases reports that the inflammatory process shown in patients with osteomyelitis after knee nosocomial infections were due to the excessive use of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications and the withdrawn of the use of these medications that these two patients were using to treat the nosocomial infection were responsible for the manifestation of osteomyelitis symptoms [35]. As said by Hippocrates, the symptoms presented by Wood Fire Earth Metal Water Orientation East South Middle West North Season Spring Summer Late Summer Autumn Winter Climate Wind Summer Heat Dampness Dryness Cold Cultivation Germinate Grow Transform Reap Store Yin Organ Liver Heart Spleen Lung Kidney Yang Organ Gall Bladder Small Intestine Stomach Large Intestine Bladder Orifice Eye Tongue Mouth Nose Ear Tissues Tendons Vessels Muscles Skin & Hair Bones Emotions Anger Joy Pensiveness Grief Fear Color Blue / Green Red Yellow White Black Taste Sour Bitter Sweet Pungent Salty V oice Shout Laugh Sing Cry Groan Table 4: Five elements and the five massive organs and their correspondence of external sensorial organs, seasons, climate, color, taste, etc. Figure 4: Demonstration of the various situations that the patient can present the Zhen- Qi and Xie-Qi.

In this case, the symptoms manifested by the patients could be only the reactions of the body against the influences of the type of the medications used, type of foods that the patients is consuming and also, the influences of the external pathogenic factor entrance in this patients, that is normally not considered in the formation and manifestation of disease process in Western medicine [7]. According to the Five Elements and Yin and Yang theories, the functioning of all energy meridians is interlinked. Therefore, if the Spleen or the fifth chakra is imbalanced, it will cause a decrease in the absorption of nutrients, leading to a reduction in the formation of Blood and is controlled by the Heart or third chakra and both were without energy. This malnutrition will lead to decrease in Yin and Yang energy, produced by the Kidneys (second chakra), and a decrease in the energy of the Liver (first chakra), responsible for energy distribution. But to have Yin and Yang energies, the person has to have energy in the Kidney or second chakra that is where these energies are produced [31]. Without energy to circulate properly in the body and blood vessels, Blood stasis and Qi stagnation can occur. The Qi energies is distributed by the Liver or first chakra and the Lung that is the forth chakra that in these patients were in the minimum level of energy [12- 31]. Although we do not find articles in the literature discussing the deaths that occurred in patients after taking the vaccines, it is known, through social media, newspapers and news sites around the world, that in several countries where people are already being vaccinated, there are people said to be healthy, dying after being vaccinated [36]. There are reports of some people having blood clot after receiving some kinds of vaccines. Although we cannot find any scientific article explaining all these facts, in the Western medical perspective, they cannot explain the reason what is behind these symptom [37]. Western medicine sees the patient in the leaf level that the author showed and demonstrated in the tree like (Figure 1). But in the root of this tree, the internal massive organs of these patients could be compromised, as the author showed in the (Tables 1,2 and 3). These people that are receiving these vaccines are compromised due to the lack of energy in all the massive organ, responsible for the production of Yin, Yang, Qi and Blood, as the author demonstrated in the beginning of this article. The lack of this energy could be the cause leading to the stagnation of Blood, and can manifest in many kinds of symptoms, in the leaf level, but the cause could be the same (energy deficiency and Heat retention) [12-29]. To avoid this complication, it is necessary to treat this energy deficiency that the author is demonstrating in many articles wrote by her, all involving Blood stagnation. In one of the articles entitled Chakras' Energies Deficiencies as the Main Cause of Myocardial Infarction without Arterial Obstruction , the author is demonstrating that the cause of several myocardial infarction presented by the patient reported in this article was caused by energy deficiencies in the chakras' energy centers and the replenishment of this energy using homeopathies medications according to the theory Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements based on Traditional Chinese Medicine was very important to prevent the stagnation of Blood inside the Heart artery, that was leading to the symptoms of myocardial infarction, even without any arterial obstruction, diagnosed by coronary angiography and cardiac catheterization [20]. Even patients that have history of myocardial infarction with arterial obstruction has chakras' energy centers without energy, as the author is demonstrating in the article entitled The Importance of Correcting Energy Imbalances in the Prevention and Treatment of Myocardial Infarction , published on May 2020. The necessity of treating these patients with history of myocardial infarction, replenishing the chakras' energy centers are the major importance in prevention another myocardial infarction because the lack of energy that was causing the stagnation of Blood inside the vessel was not corrected yet leading to more propensity to have another myocardial infarction or another clinical condition that always have an energy deficiency in the background, as the author demonstrated in several articles published by her. So, are we not underestimating our immunocompromised population? Are our immunocompromised much bigger than we think they are? Immunocompromised people are not only those who have HIV , diabetes, cancer or are immunosuppressed. For this study that the author has done, patients diagnosed with anxiety, depression, panic syndrome, back pain, knee pain, headache, diabetes... all are in the group of immunocompromised, because everyone's energy is low. The sample that the author is demonstrating in this article was in Brazil but she thinks that this lack of energy could be affecting the entire population in this world, as she will explain in the next paragraphs [12- 29]. According to Andrew Clark et al in the article Global, regional, and national estimates of the population at increased risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions in 2020: A modelling study, the estimates of the number of individuals at increased risk were most sensitive to the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory disease. However, these studies cannot capture the global diversity of patterns of multi morbidity, which will differ in regions where, for example, there are high prevalence of HIV or sickle cell disorders [38]. In the article entitled Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study published by Nanshan Chen et al, at the Lancet in January 2020, they showed a study with 99 patients in a hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients described in this article already had comorbidities such as chronic medical illness (51%), cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (40%), digestive system disease (11%), endocrine system disease (13%), malignant tumor (1%), nervous system disease (1%), and respiratory system disease (1%). The evolution of these patients to acute respiratory distress syndrome were 17 %, acute renal injure were 3%, acute respiratory injure were 8%, septic shock was 4% and ventilator associate pneumonia was 1% [39]. The author also wrote some articles regarding cancer, in one of them entitled The Importance of Treating Energy Imbalances and Chakras Replenishment for Prevention and Treatment of Cancer, published in 2020 at Advances in Cancer Research & Clinical Imaging and in this article, the author is demonstrating through three cases reports that cancer patients have energy deficiencies and Heat retention as root and also chakra's energy deficiencies in the lowest level. The balance of the energy deficiencies and taking out the Heat retention associated with the replenishment of these energies is important to prevent and treat cancer patients [15]. The author also has two others articles regarding cancer: Energies and Chakras' Replenishment in Prevention and Treatment of Patients with Atypical Pap Cells Exam and Chakras' Energies Deficiencies as One of the Cause of Kidney Cancer. In the first, the author showed that the atypical cellular results in a pap smear exam can be normalized with a correction of the woman's body energies disturbances and using Chinese dietary counseling, auricular acupuncture, apex-ear bloodletting as a tool Citation: Huang WL (2021) Are We Vaccinating Immunocompetent or for COVID 19?

And in the second, the author demonstrated that one possible cause for kidney cancer development could be the chakras' energy deficiencies. The replenishment of the chakras' energy is very important to recover the energy of the patients that is leading to cancer formation, preventing for metastasis and also, the generation of other kinds of chronic diseases or other cancers in other sites of the body [17]. In another two articles entitled: Energy Imbalances and Chakras Energy Replenishment to Treat Patients with Urinary Incontinence and Sexual Dysfunction Post-Cancer Prostatectomy and Energies Alterations and Chakras' Energies Deficiencies as the Main Cause of Radiation induced Rectal Bleeding Post-Prostate Cancer Surgery, the author is showing that patients with urinary incontinence, sexual dysfunction and rectal bleeding post-cancer prostatectomy have energy imbalances and chakras' energy deficiencies as the root of the symptoms. The treatment rebalancing these energies and replenishing the chakras' energy centers, with high-diluted medications (homeopathies according to the theory Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements based on Traditional Chinese Medicine ) was crucial for the recovery of the symptoms presented by all the patients after the surgery but the treatment was done looking at the root of the problem, that was the energy deficiencies and not just the symptoms [18,19]. The author presented a study entitled Chakras' Energies Deficiencies as the Second Cause of Immune Deficiency in HIV patients in the HIV AIDS Infectious Disease and Health Care Webinar on November 23rd, 2020 where she demonstrated that patients with HIV and in treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and other kinds of medications have chakras' energy deficiencies and the treatment of these deficiencies are important to improve their immune system [40]. All these patients that are considerate immunocompromised by Western medicine, with diabetes, hypertension, cancer, HIV , chronic diseases such as patients with knee pain, anxiety, depression, insomnia, panic syndrome, community and nosocomial infections etc., all have in common the lack of energy in the five massive organs and the articles that they are saying that they all have chakras' energy deficiencies are shown in several articles published by the author and presented in many webinars during 2020 and 2021. As you can see in the (Tables 1, 2 and 3), the author is showing that the majority of patients that had chakras' energy deficiencies had common diagnosis (anxiety, depression, headache and knee pain, low back pain) and are not considered nowadays as high-risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. But, in this study, the author is demonstrating that the majority of patients are in the risks of acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection due to these lack of energy in the chakras' energy centers because energy means immunity in traditional Chinese medicine, leading to the weak Zheng-Qi, responsible for the prevention of the entrance of the external pathogenic factor inside the body. Another important consideration concerning these studies is that all patients who were not characterized as immunocompromised, can also be considered immunocompromised, because according to the authors experience, some 6 or 7 years ago (2013 or in 2014) patients were not in the same energy situation like in this study. People had energy in their organs, there were few people who they had no energy at all. What the author is seeing is that in the last 5 years everyone has no energy in their organs, measured by the radiesthesia procedure. The lack of energy found in the majority of patients could be related to the 5G technology, as mentioned by Thomas Cohen, a medical doctor from USA. It is possible that the beginning of the use of these devices could be one of the reason that the whole population could be nowadays. The author is generalizing to the whole population because the electromagnetic waves are in the whole world and could be affecting the majority of the population in the world, [12- 29]. In publications regarding the possible harmful effects of the electromagnetic waves in the literature, what the author noticed was that the studies that concluded that this energy cannot induce harmful effects on the human body, they did not study the energy of the patients in the majority of them, and that occurs because the energy level cannot be seeing by the naked eyes [41]. In the article, entitled Did Wired and Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony cause the emergence of epidemic Poliomyelitis. written by Vincent Lauer, the author is showing that the time coincidences of poliomyelitis epidemiology and electromagnetic waves emissions, together with the evolution of the virus of polio, bring strong support to the hypothesis that exposure to electromagnetic fields triggered both epidemic poliomyelitis and the diversification of the virus of polio [42]. In the article entitled Health risks from radiofrequency radiation, including 5G, written by Hardell and Carlberg, that there are lack of proper risk evaluation of the 5G technology because there are cartel of individuals all monopolizing the committees that are evaluating these effects and it is characterizing this action as scientific misconduct [43]. To show that the evolution from health to disease has energy disturbances in the back ground, the author is demonstrating through the (Table 5), the different phases. Before a disease is detected during laboratorial exams, there has already been an alteration in energy level, the patients have symptoms but the tests are still normal. There are various phases of disease progression in a healthy body. During phases 1 to 3, only a slowing of the organ functions occurs because of energy imbalances, and the patient has and complains of symptoms, but the results of laboratorial exams are normal. At phase 4 the laboratory exams show some alterations, and the disease is still curable, and at phase 5, the exams are very altered, and the cellular damage is irreversible and the disease incurable. To have changes in the exams, the person must have spent many years with energy imbalances. To you better understand this difference, you can imagine two similar batteries, one charged and one discharged. The one that is charged you will be able to use, the same happens with the organs in our body, are not possible see in the laboratorial exams if they are charged in energy or not. That is why the person may appear to be well, but he could be without energy, like the discharged battery. The author\u00b4s suggestion is that each country measures the energy of its population in order to know if this is happening only in some places or if it is something that is happening in whole world [12-29]. To treat these energy deficiencies, the author is using the homeopathies medications according to the theory Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements based on Traditional Chinese Medicine of all her patients, shown in the Table 6. This treatment needs to be at least for more than one year but the author still studding and evaluating these patients and until today she could not stop the patients for the use of these medications because they would reduce their energy and became weak in energy again, causing the manifestation of diverse symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and a diverse disease as the author demonstrated throughout the article [31]. The medications used are shown in the (Table 6). Citation: Huang WL (2021) Are We Vaccinating Immunocompetent or for COVID 19? J Vaccines Res Vaccin 7: 018. Page 8 of 10 J Vaccines Res Vaccin ISSN: 2573-0193, Open Access Journal DOI: 10.24966/VRV-0193/100018 Volume 7 Issue 1 100018 In this case, the author is using highly diluted medications because of Arndt-Shultz law, shown in the (Figure 6) [44]. In this law, created by two German researchers, they are saying that the use of high concentrated medications can harm the vital energy or prana in Ayurvedic medicine or Qi in traditional Chinese medicine and the use of highly diluted medications can improve the internal energy, as you can see in the Figure 6. For this reason, it is important to use highly diluted medications to replenish the chakras' energy centers of these patients that were in the lowest level of energy, and reduce or avoid the use of highly concentrated medications, as showed in many publications of the author. Currently, Western and traditional Chinese medicine are different for most physicians around the world. However, they can be integrated. A metaphor of Yin and Yang as the different kinds of medicine was created. For the adequate treatment of the diseases and to understand the different points of view regarding the classification in immunocompetent or immune deficient, it is important to associate traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine\u00b4s reasoning, so the patient can be seen on the symptoms level and on the root of the problem, which are the energy imbalances [12-29] (Figure 7). Conclusion The conclusion of this study is that we are vaccinating immunecompromised people and not immunecompetent for COVID 19. In the group of patients studied by the author, more than 90% of the patients have no energy in the chakras' energy centers and 97% of the patients have lack of energy in the second chakra or the Kidney energy meridian in TCM, that is responsible for maintenance of Zheng Qi, that is the ability of protecting the body against the invasion of the external pathogenic factor and the ability of recover after the infectious process. The result in this article could be important to understand the other process related to complications related to vaccination in the population we have nowadays, for example blood clot or even death, because these alterations are in the energy level that cannot apeear in the laboratorial exams . More studies regarding this field need to be done in more countries to evaluate if these alterations are in the whole world to study and implement other measures to reduce the posible causes that are harming the vital energy of our population, leading to immunedeficiency.
