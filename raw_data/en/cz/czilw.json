Find out what to do with these tips!", "sitename": "BODi", "date": "2016-11-09", "cleaned_text": "What to Eat Before and After a Cleanse So you finally decided to do it: [You're going to do a cleanse](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/cleanse-hub). You [figured out which one is right for you](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/quiz-which-cleanse-is-right-for-you-3-day-refresh-or-ultimate-reset), and you're prepared for what you need to do during your cleanse. But what are you supposed to do before? Or after? Does it even matter? It does matter. Why? Because by doing a little preparation, you 'll make the transition into a cleanse feel less... challenging, and by easing slowly back into a regular routine afterward, you'll help make your healthy new habits more likely to stick. And of course, any time you make significant changes to your diet, it's always a good idea to check in with your doctor first, especially if you take medication or have a health condition. What to Do Before a Cleanse DO Research Your Cleanse If you're doing [3-Day Refresh](http://www.teambeachbody.com/shop/us/b/nutrition-supplement?subcategory=3DayRefresh&ICID=BLOG_3DRF&refsource=Blog), don't stress too much about what you eat beforehand; it's OK to start right after a calorie-bomb weekend or holiday feast. \"That's what the R.D., is a way to get back on track.\" But you can make things easier for yourself by [prepping your meals ahead of time](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/try-the-3-day-refresh-with-this-easy-meal-prep). You'll also want to taper off heavy exercise. It's generally not a great idea to head into a serious calorie deficit situation when your body is trying to replenish glycogen or repair muscle. For a longer cleanse like [Ultimate Reset](https://www.teambeachbody.com/shop/us/b/nutrition-programs?ICID=BLOG_REST&refsource=Blog), you'll probably want to do a little more [prep work](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-cleanse). In addition to tapering off your workouts, make it a point to get more sleep and alert your family and friends so they can cheer you on. If you need a little more support, there's a Facebook page full of [people who have your back](https://www.facebook.com/UltimateReset/). DON'T Go on a Pre-Cleanse Binge Sure, you could eat a whole pizza for dinner the night before your cleanse starts, but intentionally bookending your cleanse with greasy grub as the \"last meal\" reinforces the idea that healthy food is something you have to suffer through. \"This is not your last chance to eat junk food,\" says Denis Faye, M.S. \"There's nothing wrong with indulging occasionally, but don't make healthy food the villain.\" Instead, remind yourself why you're doing the cleanse in the first place \u2014 and focus on the [tasty recipes](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/tag/ultimate-reset-recipes) you have planned during your cleanse. DO Cut Back on Caffeine Sorry, coffee lovers, but it's gotta be done. If you're struggling to imagine mornings without coffee, we feel you \u2014 but easing up slowly beforehand will be a lot easier than going cold turkey on Day 1. DO Eat More Fiber [Ultimate Reset](https://www.teambeachbody.com/shop/us/b/nutrition-programs?ICID=BLOG_REST&refsource=Blog) is high in fiber, so if you don't already follow a high-fiber diet, consider upping your intake in the week leading up to your cleanse. \"Fiber is good for you, but it can also make you a little gassy sometimes, especially if you're not used to it,\" says Faye. Adding more fiber before you start a cleanse will give your body extra time to adapt. What to Do After Your Cleanse DO Take It Slow A no-holds-barred cheat day might sound like a fantastic idea, especially when you're craving a plate of loaded nachos. But the day after your cleanse is not a good time to go all-out. \"Your body has been working at its ultimate capacity,\" Bente says. \"You've been putting healthy, whole foods in \u2014 to shock it with a highly processed meal is going to make you feel sick.\" DO Observe How Your Body Reacts If you completed the [Ultimate Reset](https://www.teambeachbody.com/shop/us/b/nutrition-programs?ICID=BLOG_REST&refsource=Blog) (well done, you!), start adding grains back into your diet during the first week afterward, and pay attention to how your body reacts to each new food. If something makes you feel sick, gassy, or congested, Faye says, you may be sensitive to that food. DO Branch Out Slowly In the second week, as your body adjusts, you can boost your portion sizes a bit and add legumes and tempeh back in. DO Add Animal Products Last Three weeks after, you can slowly start adding meat back into your diet (if you eat meat, of course). Start with organic yogurt or eggs, then add other animal products back in slowly. DO Reevaluate Your Diet You can always use your cleanse as a jumping-off point to try a vegan diet or cut back on carbs. \"You don't have to introduce every food back,\" Faye says. \"Just because the [ [Ultimate Reset](https://www.teambeachbody.com/shop/us/b/nutrition-programs?ICID=BLOG_REST&refsource=Blog)] guide says you can reintroduce animal protein in week 3, you don't have to \u2014 it's only if you want to.\" Start with some of these [post-cleanse recipes](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/tag/ultimate-reset-post-reset-recipes) to help you get started. DO Stay Hydrated If you had to boost your water intake to get through the cleanse, that's actually a hint that you may not have been getting enough water in the first place. Even after the cleanse is over, Faye says, \"There's no tapering off \u2014 just keep drinking water.\" Not sure [how much water you need](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/why-do-we-need-water-and-how-much-should-we-be-drinking)? BODi recommends using your body weight as a general guide to get started. Drink your body weight, divided by two, in ounces. So, if you weigh 150 pounds, that would be 150 divided by 2, which equals 75. That's 75 ounces of water every day. But note: That amount will change depending on your activity level and the environment you're in, but it's a good place to start. DON'T Go Back to Bad Habits Processed foods, sugar, alcohol, tobacco, and artificial sweeteners should be avoided as long as you possibly can after your cleanse. \"If you can stay away from them forever, great,\" Bente says. After the tune-up your body gets from the cleanse, you may find you no longer crave junk, anyway. By taking a little time to prepare and care for your body pre- and post-cleanse, you'll reap the rewards long after it's over. "}
