Anyone over the age of nine months with plans to travel to or live in an area that's at high risk for the yellow fever virus, such as South America and Africa, should receive a yellow fever vaccine. If you are planning on traveling from Crystal to Brazil, Ghana, or a number of other countries, a yellow fever vaccine will be required for entry. You must be vaccinated at least ten days before your trip. While a yellow fever vaccine cannot be administered over video, your doctor can evaluate and advise you or your child from your home in Crystal. They can discuss your travel plans, recommend and order necessary vaccinations, and book immunization appointments via telemedicine. Without insurance, a consultation, service fee and yellow-fever vaccine will typically range from $150 to $350. With preventative insurance, you will end up paying the copay for a consultation and vaccine administration, ranging from $10 to $40. Costs will vary by clinic - book a consultation at a Crystal-area clinic to see how much a yellow-fever vaccine would cost for you. As yellow fever vaccines are considered elective, it's not uncommon that insurance will not cover the cost of the vaccine. However, if your plan includes preventative benefits, the yellow fever vaccine will usually be covered and you may only need to cover the co-pay out-of-pocket. Telemedicine vaccine consultation coverage will vary depending on your circumstances. Typically, if your insurance will not cover an in-person visit, it won't cover similar appointments via telehealth. Since the yellow fever vaccine is considered elective and in-person visits are not usually covered by medical insurance, it is unlikely video visits with travel vaccination specialists will be covered. Getting the yellow fever vaccine can reduce your risk of getting this viral infection. Knowing more about the yellow fever shot and how it works can empower you to make informed healthcare decisions for yourself and your family. Yellow fever is a viral infection you can contract if you are bitten by a mosquito infected with this virus. Anyone can get yellow fever, though older adults may be at higher risk for severe infection, reports the National Library of Medicine (NLM). This disease tends to be common in South America and sub-Saharan Africa, adds the NLM. Yellow fever has three stages: the infection stage, the remission stage, and the intoxication stage, reports the NLM. Symptoms of yellow fever are different depending on the stage you're in. Stage 1 of yellow fever is the acute infection phase or the acute phase. According to the NLM, symptoms in the acute phase usually go away within three to four days and include: Stage 2 of yellow fever is the remission phase. Some people recover fully from yellow fever during this phase, while others may develop more severe symptoms and progress to the toxic phase, adds the NLM. Stage 3 of yellow fever is the toxic stage or the intoxication stage. The NLM reports that symptoms in the toxic phase usually affect the organs, especially the heart, liver, and kidney. These symptoms include: The NLM suggests seeing a doctor at least 10 to 14 days before traveling to a region in which yellow fever is common. It adds that yellow fever countries where this virus is common include certain parts of Africa and South America. Your doctor can use this information to determine whether you should be vaccinated as a yellow fever prevention method. You should also see your doctor when you arrive home after traveling to these countries. The NLM recommends contacting your doctor immediately if you have traveled to a region where yellow fever is common and you or a family member has developed fever, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, or jaundice. Yellow fever is caused by a virus that is carried by mosquitoes. You can get yellow fever if you are bit by one of these mosquitoes and aren't vaccinated against this virus. According to the NLM, the yellow fever virus is found mainly in certain parts of Africa and South America. Being unvaccinated against yellow fever is a major risk factor for this virus. Avoiding trips to yellow fever countries in Africa and South America can also reduce your risk of getting yellow fever, reports the NLM. Other steps you can take to lower your risk further, according to the CDC, include using mosquito repellent products, wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, and taking steps to control mosquitoes indoors and outdoors. Yellow fever can cause a wide range of serious health problems, reports the NLM. Internal bleeding and even death can occur if you get yellow fever. Other potential complications from yellow fever include: The yellow fever vaccine may prevent yellow fever, states the NLM. Other effective prevention methods include staying in areas that are screened in or air-conditioned, wearing protective clothing, and using effective insect repellent products. The yellow fever vaccine can provide lifelong protection against this virus, states the CDC. The NLM adds that this vaccine is approved for use in people between the ages of nine months and 59 years who are traveling to or who live in an area where yellow fever is known to exist. Many countries require you to show proof of vaccination against yellow fever before you can enter. According to the CDC, the best way to protect yourself against mosquitoes is to use an insect repellent that is registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Repellents registered with the EPA contain active ingredients such as DEET and oil of lemon eucalyptus that can ward off mosquitoes to prevent mosquito bites and yellow fever. The CDC also recommends wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants to prevent mosquito bites and spending time indoors where window screens and air conditioners are available and fully functional.
