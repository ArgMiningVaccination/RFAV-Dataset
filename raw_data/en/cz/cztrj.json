Expo - sure to bloodborne pathogens through a contaminated needlestick or cut is the most frequent mode of transmis - sion in healthcare workers.1 Expo - sure can also occur with exposure to nonintact skin (eg, chapped, abraded, infected, or cut skin). Human bites are another potential means for bloodborne pathogen transmission, although this has been infrequently documented. Bloodborne pathogens, including HIV, are found at highest concentra - tions in blood or body fluids.4 The greatest risk for transmission, to healthcare workers, occurs from expo - sure to blood and bloody secretions, while exposure to infected fluids or tissues remains a lower risk. Body flu - ids, which may be potentially infected with HIV, include cerebrospinal fluid, amniotic fluid, or any body fluid visibly contaminated with blood. Urine, feces, saliva, sputum, sweat, vomitus, and tears are considered to have low infec - tious potential unless visibly contami - nated with blood. Initiation of postexposure prophy - laxis (PEP) should occur as soon as (continued on page 4) pathogens infections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infec - tions.2 Occupational exposures should be considered urgent medical concerns to ensure timely postexposure man - agement. Appropriate postexposure management is an important element of workplace safety, and an essential component to preventing infection fol - lowing bloodborne pathogen exposure. Healthcare workers are at an increased risk for contracting HIV through contact with contaminated needles or sharp objects or a splash to mucous membranes (ie, eyes, nose, or mouth).1 According to the World Health Organization, the risk of transmis - sion of HIV from an infected patient through a needlestick where the skin is punctured by a sharp is less than Occupational exposures should be considered urgent medical concerns to ensure timely post- exposure management. Appropriate postexposure management is an important element of workplace safety, and an essential component to preventing infection following bloodborne pathogen exposure.2(continued on next page) CRITERIA-FOR-USE CHANGES Methylene Cannot be used in tube feedings Methylnaltrexone and alvimopan are the first peripheral mu-opioid-re - ceptor antagonists. Both agents were reviewed proactively because of their potential for off-label misuse, potential safety issues, and high costs. Methylnaltrexone is an injectable peripheral mu-opioid-receptor antago - nist with a labeled indication for the treatment of opioid-induced constipa - tion when laxatives have failed. It is intended for palliative care patients receiving large doses of opioids for chronic pain. Methylnaltrexone is given subcutaneously every other day. The dosage has to be reduced with renal dysfunction, and it should not be used in patients with severe hepatic disease or bowel obstruction. Methylnaltrexone was shown to be effective at producing rescue-free laxation within 4 hours compared with placebo. Patients received their regular laxative treatments for at least 3 days prior to methylnaltrexone treatment. It should be noted that 9% to 14% of patients in the placebo group had a bowel movement within 4 hours of \"treatment.\" Gastrointestinal effects are the most common adverse effects (ie, diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatus, and nausea). Dizziness is also a common effect. The mechanism for dizziness is unclear since methylnaltrexone does not cross the blood-brain barrier. An indirect effect may be the cause. Few patients have been exposed to methylnaltrexone, so its safety is not well described. Methylnaltrexone was added in the Formulary but was restricted to use for its labeled indication. This restriction will be enforced by a Methylnaltrexone Order Form . The indication for use, contraindications, and dosage must be specified on the form. Methylnaltrex - one will automatically be stopped once the patient has a bowel movement. Alvimopan is an oral peripheral mu-opioid-receptor antagonist with a labeled indication for the prevention of post-operative ileus. Alvimopan was approved by FDA despite concerns about cardiovascular toxicity, and therefore, it is available only via a re - stricted drug distribution program that limits its use to hospitals and only for 7 days and 15 doses (ie, the Entereg Access Support & Education Program or EASE Program). Alvimopan appears to be effective compared to placebo as measured by the GI-2, which measures the time to pa - tients taking oral food post-operatively or when the patient has their first bowel movement. Also, it decreases length-of- stay (LOS), but the effect is small, and it is unclear if decreased LOS will be real - ized in a practice setting. Chewing gum (sugar-free) has been shown to have a greater effect on post-operative ileus and LOS by a Cochrane review, but this is not a direct comparison to alvimopan. A direct comparison between alvimopan and chewing gum would be interesting. Gastrointestinal effects are the com - mon adverse effects. Few patients have been exposed to alvimopan, so safety is not well described. As previously noted, a higher rate of myocardial infarctions was noted in a long-term study of alvi - mopan for the reversal of constipation in patients with chronic pain receiving opioids. This is not an approved use for alvimopan. Alvimopan was reviewed proactively because of the potential for misuse and because it cannot be used until (or if) Shands at UF signs the EASE agree - ment, which puts strict limitations on its use. Alvimopan costs $62 per capsule and an entire prophylactic course could cost near $1000 per patient. Currently, use to prevent post-opera - tive ileus after colon resection surgery is the only approved use for alvimopan, and off-label use is prohibited. This, along with the current safety concerns, led to the nonformulary and not avail - able designation. Olmesartan is 1 of 7 FDA-approved angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs); 3 (losartan, irbesartan, Shands at UF Formulary . However, olmesartan was frequently ordered through the nonformu - lary process. There is limited information to support the preferential use of 1 ARB over another. Olmesartan has labeled indications for the treatment of hypertension, either alone or in combination with other antihy - pertensive agents. Treatment is initiated at lower doses (ie, 5 mg to 10 mg daily) in patients who are volume-depleted. There are no recommended dosage adjustments for elderly patients or pa - tients with moderate to marked renal or hepatic dysfunction. Data from studies provide inconclu - sive results; it appears that olmesartan is comparable in efficacy to other ARBs. However, no conclusions may be made about its comparative efficacy with other agents because of methodological flaws in the published studies. Adverse effects of olmesartan are the same as expected for other ARBs. There are no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events observed between ARBs in comparative trials. Therefore, no single ARB appears to con - fer any safety benefit. No ARB should be used in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Caution is needed in severe heart failure or in patients with renal artery stenosis. Concomitant use with drugs that increase serum potas - sium may lead to hyperkalemia. The acquisition cost of olmesartan is comparable to the other available ARBs. Olmesartan was added in the Formulary pending a proposal for a therapeutic interchange among the available ARBs. Cefpodoxime was evaluated be - cause of high volume of nonformulary use. A review of the charts of the pa - tients receiving cefpodoxime revealed that it was used for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). CAP remains a common and serious illness, in spite of the availability of potent new antimicrobials and effec - tive vaccines. Initial therapy for CAP is empirical and based on the more commonly seen pathogens (ie, Strep - tococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical organisms). A goal of therapy when treating CAP is the utilization of oral antimicrobials. Switching patients from parenteral therapy to oral therapy as soon as the patient is deemed clinically stable is crucial in decreasing lengths of hospi - tal stay and costs. Cefpodoxime has a labeled indica - tion for use in community-acquired pneumonia. It mainly covers gram- negative organisms, but it is effective against some gram-positive organisms. Other labeled indications for cefpo - doxime include acute bacterial exac - erbation of chronic bronchitis, acute uncomplicated gonorrhea, uncompli - cated skin and skin infec - acute otitis media, pharyngitis or tonsillitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The results from 3 studies and 1 meta-analysis demonstrate that step- down therapy with cefpodoxime is a safe and effective option for the treat - ment of CAP. Early conversion to oral therapy from parenteral therapy in inpa - tients with CAP not only improves the quality of care for hospitalized patients but can often prevent the complica - tions and associated costs of IV therapy (ie, phlebitis, cellulitis, and bacter - emias), while at the same time allowing patients to become more mobile and permitting them to leave the hospital. The most frequently reported adverse effects for cefpodoxime are diarrhea and nausea. Cefpodoxime is contraindicated in patients with a known allergy to cefpodoxime or to the cephalosporin group of antibiotics. It should be used with caution in patients with a known penicillin allergy (ie, IgE mediated reactions). Cross hypersen - sitivity among beta-lactam antibiotics Formulary update, from page 13may occur in patients with a history of penicillin allergy. Cefpodoxime is best absorbed in an acidic environment and may interact with medications that in - crease the gastric pH (ie, antacids and H2 antagonists), lowering the effective - ness of cefpodoxime. Cefuroxime is an alternative oral option to cefpodoxime in the Formulary that is nearly 1/4 the cost for the treat - ment of CAP. Although cefpodoxime may be used in the treatment of CAP, there is no clinical or financial benefit of using it over the second generation cephalosporin cefuroxime for step- down therapy. Due to cefpodoxime's broad-spectrum of activity, it increases the risk for the development of antibi - otic resistance (ie, greater \"collateral damage\"). Therefore, the Anti-Infective Subcommittee (AIS) recommended that cefpodoxime be designated nonformu - lary and not available. Levocetirizine is a recently-market - ed prescription nonsedating antihis - tamine. It is the active enantiomer of cetirizine, which is widely available as a generic nonprescription product. Levocetirizine is twice as potent on a mg-per-mg basis as cetirizine; it is con - siderably more expensive. Cetirizine is not currently listed in the Formulary and is automatically interchanged to loratadine. Therefore, loratadine will be automatically dispensed for levo - cetirizine using the following ratios: loratadine 5 mg for levocetirizine 2.5 mg, and loratadine 10 mg for levoceti - rizine 5 mg. Human C1-esterase inhibitor is the first marketed drug with a labeled indication for treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare and poten - tially life-threatening genetic disorder than affects about 6,000 to 10,000 people in the US. This plasma-derived product regulates clotting and inflam - matory reactions that, when impaired, can lead to local tissue swelling. C1- esterase inhibitor does not function in patients with HAE, and plasma-derived human C1-esterase inhibitor replaces the nonfunctioning or missing protein. It is administered parenterally every 3 to 4 days (chronically). Cinryze\u00ae is available in the communi - ty setting only via the Cinryze\u00ae Solutions Program (877-945-1000) from 2 specialty pharmacies (Caremark and Curascript) on a patient-specific basis. Drug is shipped to the site of care, which could be the patient's home, a physician's office, a clinic, or a hospital, depending on where the patient's therapy is being administered. Shands at UF cannot purchase and stock a nonpatient-specific supply of Cinryze\u00ae. Therefore, it cannot be listed in the Formulary. Human C1-esterase inhibitor was designated a high-priority nonformu -lary drug, which creates a process to inform prescribers about how to acquire Cinryze\u00ae for inpatient use, if a patient is admitted. Patients can receive this drug in the inpatient setting only if they use their own supply. This will be an exception to the Patients Own Medica - tions policy, which generally prohibits the use of a patient's supply of injectable products. However, in this case, there is no other method of continuing therapy. Eltrombopag is an oral nonpeptide thrombopoietin-receptor agonist approved by the FDA with a labeled indication for the tre atment of idiopathic thrombo- cytopenic purpura (ITP) in patients who insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. Eltrombopag is available only through a restricted-distribution program called PROMACTA Cares; prescribers, pharmacies, and patients must register in the program to prescribe, dispense, or receive eltrombopag (877-9-PROMACTA or 877-977-6622). Eltrombopag has the potential to be used off-label for the treatment of throm - bocytopenia from other causes, includ - topenia and nonchemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (eg, patients with hepatitis C virus receiving interferon and ribavirin therapy). These other indications are currently being studied. It is unclear whether these uses would be allowed in the restricted-distribution program. It is doubtful that patients could be enrolled in the restricted-distri - bution program for off-labeled uses. The major warnings for eltrombopag concern its risk of hepatotoxicity. Alanine transferase (ALT) and bilirubin must be measured at baseline and every 2 weeks during the dose adjustment phase and monthly once the dosage is stabilized. There are guidelines for addi - tional monitoring and discontinuation of therapy if ALTs or bilirubins increase. At this point, neither UF prescrib - ers nor Shands at UF are registered for the restricted-distribution program. A high-priority nonformulary designation assures that prescribers will understand the options for managing these patients during their hospitalization (eg, use of the patient's own supply of medication or use of an alternative). Methylene blue is a water-soluble dye used to diagnose suspected gastro - intestinal fistulas or for the treatment of methemoglobinemia from cyanide toxic - ity or drug-induced methemoglobinemia. Methylene blue has been used for other uses, including coloring enteral feedings for the diagnosis of aspiration. However, a 2003 FDA Health Advisory warned of deaths associated with tube feedings tinted with blue dyes. The FDA con - cluded that dyes do not offer significant benefit for the diagnosis of aspiration. Dyes may increase gastrointestinal per -meability, which has been associated with adverse events (eg, sepsis and deaths). An alternative method of aspira - tion detection involves using glucose oxidase test strips to monitor for elevations in glucose concentrations of endotracheal secretions. Endotracheal secretions normally contain low glu - cose concentrations; thus, any eleva - tion would likely indicate aspiration of glucose-rich enteral formulas. This method has been shown to be superior in detecting aspiration in comparison to the blue food dye method. A 5% false-positive rate has been reported for the detection of aspiration with glucose oxidase strip testing, as compared with a 33% false-positive rate of detection of aspiration with the blue food dye method. However, additional studies have found elevated endotracheal glucose concentrations in both enterally and nonenterally fed patients. Additional concerns with the method include false-positives from blood contamination and low sensitiv - ity when enteral formulas containing lower concentrations of glucose are used. While glucose oxidase may be superior to the blue dyes, its multiple problems preclude it from being rec - ommended as a reliable, safe method of aspiration detection. Another method of aspiration detec - tion is monitoring of gastric residual volumes (GRV) during enteral feeding. While a 2002 consensus statement recommended withholding tube feeds and reassessing tolerance if GRV is greater than 500 mL, they recommend - ed careful bedside evaluation and an algorithmic approach to management throughout various levels of GRV. However, attempts to validate the use of GRV found no appropriate desig - nated GRV level to identify aspiration could be derived because of poor sen - sitivity over a wide range of GRVs. Ultimately, radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates along with clinical manifestations of pulmonary insults remain the most accurate and reliable ways to document, as well as to assess for, significant aspiration in critically ill patients. Due to the lack of reliable bedside methods of aspiration detection in enterally fed patients, the focus should be on prevention techniques, such as proper feeding- tube placement, proper head-of-bed positioning at 30 to 45 degrees, optimi - zation of oral health, etc. Therefore, the use of methylene blue in enteral feedings is now prohib - ited. The use of glucose strips, gastric residual volumes, and radiographic methods should be considered as alternative bedside methods of detect - ing aspiration in enterally fed patients.Formulary update, from page 24Policy and procedures, from page 1 possible \u2014 within hours rather than days of exposure.1 Early PEP is thought to inhibit HIV replication.4 Studies have shown systemic infec - tion does not occur immediately; and, therefore, a short window of opportunity exists to prevent viral replication. Currently, antiretrovirals from 5 classes of drugs are available to treat HIV infection.2 Determining which PEP to use is mainly empiri - cal. The recommendations from the US Public Health Service provide guidance using 2 or more PEP drug regimens on the basis of the level of risk for HIV transmission. These rec - ommendations apply to situations in which the health care provider has been exposed to a source person who either has confirmed HIV infec - tion or whom is considered to be at high risk of HIV infection. HIV PEP is built upon the level of exposure, which is dependent upon severity and amount of exposure to blood or body fluids. Persons receiving PEP should complete a 4-week regimen; although, the optimum length of therapy has not been determined. HIV status of the source indi - vidual is useful, but not necessary. Healthcare workers who have been exposed to blood or body fluids need to treat the incident as though the patient is infected with a bloodborne pathogen.2 If the source individual has a known HIV status, then information about the stage of infection should be made available to those assisting the exposed healthcare worker. Known or suspected resistance of the source virus to antiretroviral agents, particu - larly those that could be included in a PEP regimen, is a concern and should be offered when possible. Shands at UF has an established protocol for employees exposed to HIV. Employees can access the protocol via the Pharmacy Services-UF Web - site or by accessing the following link: https://my.portal.shands.ufl.edu/ portal/page/portal/DEPT_CONTENT/ Pharmacy/UF/Department-Tools/PDFs/ HIV-PEP.pdf. Employees are instructed to go to Occupational Health Services (OHS) as soon as possible after the ex - posure, preferably within 1 to 2 hours. Exposures occurring during evening, night, or weekend hours will be tri - aged by the nursing coordinator who will make referrals to the Emergency Department (ED), if necessary. The ED attending may prescribe a 72-hour course of PEP following the protocol. The ED will administer the first dose(s) of PEP medications, and then write a prescription for the remaining medica - tions. The exposed employee will then fill the prescription at a local pharmacy. The employee should contact OHS the next business day for follow-up. UF faculty, staff, resident house- staff, and students who experience exposures to bloodborne pathogens should contact the Needle Stick Hotline at 866-477-6824. Bloodborne pathogen exposure re - mains a significant occupational haz - ard to all healthcare professionals. Prevention of exposure to blood and body fluids is the primary means of preventing occupationally acquired bloodborne pathogens. In the event of exposure, PEP should be initiated as quickly as possible. Employees should be aware of PEP practices and keep up-to-date about the latest strategies for the management of bloodborne pathogen exposure. by Morgan L. Mace, PharmD REFERENCES 1. KT .

The most new drugs approved in 1 year occurred more than 10 years ago in 1996 when 53 new drugs were approved. There has been a steady decline since then. The 24 new drugs (21 if you count only NMEs) approved in 2008 is in line with historical averages. 9 of the drugs ap - proved in 2008 were \"priority review\" drugs, which are supposed to be reviewed by the FDA within 6 months of their application. Many of the drugs and biologicals will not be widely marketed, and there were few potential blockbuster drugs approved. Only 40% of the drugs approved in 2008 were first-in-class agents, represented a significant thera - peutic advance, or addressed a disease not previously treated. Several drugs approved are for rare disorders and di - agnostic procedures. Only 3 drugs were approved for the treatment of cancer, which is lower than in previous years. 2008 was another big year for first- time generic approvals. Generic ver - sions of drugs continue to be marketed as patents expire. Many third-party payers, including Medicare Part D plans, encourage patients to use gener - ics by assessing much lower co-pays. important used in health systems include Flolan\u00ae (epo - prostenol) and Camptosar\u00ae (irinotecan). The growing arsenal of generics makes it easier to find a less expensive option in many therapeutic categories. After generics have been on the market for several months, the cost to health systems can drop by as much as 70% or more. Although difficult to predict, generic versions are expected in 2009 for Ad - vir). Many of these are blockbuster drugs accounting for over a billion dollars in sales (based on 2007 sales). Prevacid\u00ae (3.3 billion), Topamax\u00ae (1.8 billion), Lamictal\u00ae (1.7 billion), Valtrex\u00ae (1.4 billion), Adderall\u00ae XR (1.3 billion), Flomax\u00ae (1 billion), and Imitrex\u00ae (1 billion) account for more than 10 billion dollars in prescription sales.

Override medica - tions are those that are available from the Omnicell\u00ae without a pharmacist's review of the order. Whenever a medi - cation is removed from the dispensing cabinet via override, the person remov - ing the drug assumes the responsibility of the pharmacist (ie, checks for aller - gies, other contraindications, appropri - ate dosing, etc). The purpose of this revision was to comply with The Joint Commission standards for medica - tion safety, which state that all orders should be reviewed for appropriateness before administration to the patient. The 2 criteria used in determining what are appropriate override medica - tions are that a delay for pharmacist review of the order would result in im - mediate patient harm or that a licensed independent practitioner will be at the bedside during administration of the drug. Medications ordered \"Stat\" do not meet these criteria; \"Stat\" meds are needed within 15 minutes, which allows time for pharmacist review. The revision of this policy dramatically de - POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Override medications in automated dispensing cabinets creases the number of drugs available by override. For example, instead of all narcotics being available, transder - mal patches and sustained-released products have been removed since they do not provide immediate relief.
