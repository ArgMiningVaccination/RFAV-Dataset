The Wake Forest Institute of Regenerative Medicine (WFIRM) has a unique infrastructure that provides facilities and expertise for translational studies, from basic preclinical findings all the way through Phase 2 clinical trials. The overall goal of our T32 pre-doctoral training program, \"Studies in Translational Regenerative Medicine\", is to develop the next generation of multidisciplinary trained research scientists and engineers, who will lead new diverse research teams designing solutions to real-world health problems and advance the RM field. Ability to link state-of-the-art multidisciplinary basic science training to the infrastructure and knowledge base required to accelerate translation of RM technologies are key strengths. WFIRM's multidisciplinary training includes a range of activities, including didactic courses, participation in cutting-edge team science, and new opportunities to engage in academic, government, and industrial externships. The new program emphasizes professional and career development, including project and time management, grant writing, regulatory science, GMP manufacturing, and scientific ethics. The program has 3 NIBIB-aligned focus areas: - Biomaterials - Enabling Technologies (bioprinting, body-on-a-chip, imaging & multifluidics) - Stem Cells/Cell Therapies applied to one or more application areas: - Cardiovascular - Musculoskeletal - Gastrointestinal/Endocrine - Urological After a common 1st year curriculum (unique to each track), trainees identify one of 13 primary mentors (of 22 mentoring faculty), take specialized RM courses and choose a graduate committee. Inclusion of seasoned Primary Mentors (13), Mentors-in-Training (6), and Emeritus Mentors (3) with career-long mentoring experience is a unique program aspect. The program is reviewed by Internal and External Advisory Boards composed of prominent academic, government, and industry members. The T32 program has 21 mentors, arranged in well-defined, three-level mentoring/co-mentoring structure: primary mentors (n=13), mentors in training (n=4), and Emeritus Mentors (n=4). Concomitantly, each research focus contains at least five faculty members with complementary expertise, who participate in the training and supervision of graduate students as co-mentors. WFIRM faculty have appointments in multiple graduate tracks, bringing together expertise and cutting-edge technologies in cell and molecular biology, genetics, biomedical engineering, physiology, stem cell biology, animal modeling, surgery, matrix biochemistry, and materials chemistry. All 19 training faculty have a primary appointment or a cross-appointment at WFIRM. Every translational research project at WFIRM is co-mentored by a basic scientist and a clinician. Trainees also engage with clinical co-mentors who are selected from many experts available across our extensive network of intramural, extramural and international collaborations. The primary focus of the STRM training program is in the following PhD program tracks of [Wake Forest University Graduate School](/education-and-training/graduate-programs) [Biomedical Biosciences](/education-and-training/graduate-programs/molecular-and-cellular-biosciences-track)(MCB) [Integrative Physiology and Pharmacology](/education-and-training/graduate-programs/integrative-physiology-and-pharmacology)(IPP) After a common 1st year curriculum (unique to each track), trainees identify one of 12 primary mentors (of 20 mentoring faculty), take specialized RM courses and choose a graduate committee choose a graduate committee that will guide them through their thesis work and participate in a variety of WFIRM-wide training activities; special workshops; participation in cutting-edge team research; grant writing; scientific presentations; and opportunities to engage within academic, government and industry collaborations. Inclusion of seasoned Primary Mentors, Mentors-in-Training, and Emeritus Mentors with career-long mentoring experience is a unique program aspect. The program is reviewed by Internal and External Advisory Boards composed of prominent academic, government, and industry members. The Program Director, [Dr. Anthony Atala](/faculty/a/anthony-atala), has ultimate responsibility for the administration of the training program, assisted by Co-Program Director, Dr Graca Almeida-Porada and an Executive Committee composed of senior experienced trainers. The training program is reviewed and evaluated annually by both an Internal Advisory Committee and External Advisory Committee, whose members have extensive experience managing training programs as well as nationally renowned research programs in regenerative medicine.

[Read more about our past fellows and where they are Nicholas Edenhoffer is a graduate student in the Integrative Physiology and Physiology PhD program. He is mentored by Dr. Shay Soker at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. His project focuses on using patient-derived tumor organoid models to study the interactions between cancer, stromal cells, and the surrounding extracellular matrix that composes the tumor microenvironment. The insights gained from this project could contribute to the development of innovative strategies to modulate the tumor microenvironment in order to enhance the efficacy of current cancer treatments.
