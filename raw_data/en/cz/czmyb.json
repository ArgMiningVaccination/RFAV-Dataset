Ayurveda is an ancient Indian medicine and health system that originated thousands of years. It is based on balance and harmony between the body, mind, and spirit and promotes physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. Ayurveda considers disease a result of an imbalance in the individual's unique combination of doshas, the biological energies that govern different bodily functions. Ayurvedic massage, also known as abhyanga, is a traditional massage based on the principles of Ayurveda. Massage involves the application of warm herbal oils to the body, which are believed to promote balance and harmony by nourishing the skin, reducing stress and anxiety, and improving circulation. The oils used in Ayurvedic massage are chosen based on the individual's unique dosha type and can help to restore balance and promote overall well-being. Ayurvedic massage is part of a comprehensive Ayurvedic treatment plan. It is considered a holistic and gentle form of therapy that can help promote physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. The treatment includes various health conditions, including stress, insomnia, digestive problems, and joint.
