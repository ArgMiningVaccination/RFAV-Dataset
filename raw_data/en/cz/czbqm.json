The Measure states: \"The citizen oversight committee shall annually review the expenditure of the essential health care services tax fund for the prior year and shall report to the Board of Supervisors on the conformity of such expenditures. \" With ongoing support from the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA), the Oversight Committee spent several months reviewing allocation reports, highlighting accomplishments while deliberating and communicating concerns to providers, and reviewing and editing the Measure A annual report. Report forms that are based on the Results-Based Accountability methodology, along with in-person presentations from several providers, were used to review all funding allocations. history of the Measure Passed by 71% of Alameda County voters in March 2004 Extended through 2034 (as Measure AA) by 76% of voters in June 2014 Raises County sales tax by one-half cent for health care services: Emergency medical, hospital inpatient/outpatient, public health, mental health, substance abuse target populations: Indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children and families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County \u00bd % Overall Conclusion The Oversight Committee found that Alameda Health System (AHS) and other recipients of the sales tax revenue spent the funds in compliance with the provisions of Measure A. The Oversight Committee did have concerns for a small number of allocations. These concerns are noted in this Executive Summary and in the individual report summaries for the relevant providers. Measure A generated $142,643,720* in FY 16/17. Of the $142,643,720 that Measure A generated in FY 16/17, AHS received 75%, and the remainder of the funds was distributed by the Board to many health care providers who provide essential health care services.

Despite these achievements in increasing the number of individuals who have health insurance, an estimated 80,391 individuals or 4.9% of County residents, remain uninsured according to the American Community Survey estimates for 2017. Thus, Measure A revenues continue to play a critical role in helping indigent, uninsured, and low income residents of Alameda County\u2014who depend on the County's health care safety net\u2014maintain access to essential health services. With regard to Measure A recipient reporting, the Committee recognizes an ongoing trend of improvement in the quality and level of detail in the reporting process compared to prior years. This is due in part to the ongoing effort of the Committee and the Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) to improve the accountability of Measure A recipients by providing ongoing technical assistance training to providers. Everybody Benefits In a continuing trend, Measure A funds in FY 16/17 supported the health and well-being of large numbers of County residents. Providers serving large populations included AHS (122,636 County residents through Measure A) and the Alameda County Public Health Department Public Health Prevention Initiative (64,959). Patient numbers accessing care for certain diagnoses at Primary Care Community-Based Organizations included 40,514 patients with hypertension; 23,415 30,153 with a mental health diagnosis; and 1,714 with HIV. Measure A's reach extended throughout the County. Recipient providers stretched from Berkeley in the north to Fremont in the south to Livermore in the east. Measure A Leverages Additional Funding Many Measure A recipients leveraged their allocations to receive additional funds from other sources. For the 25% of Measure A funds allocated by the Board, recipients leveraged their allocations to obtain a total of $26,756,099 in matching funds. Thus, every $1 in Measure A funds to these recipients returned $0.78 in matching funds. For some recipients, the matching funds represented a return greater than 1 to 1. Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center, Inc. obtained over $210,000 AHS served 122,636 County residents through Measure A in FY 16/17, while the Alameda County Public Health Department Public Health Prevention Initiative served 64,959 . Alameda County Community Food Bank2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 6in matching funds on its $60,000 Measure A allocation. Eden Youth and Family Center obtained over $200,000 in matching funds on its $75,000 Measure A allocation. Most notably, the School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative obtained over $6,000,000 in matching funds on its $622,000 Measure A allocation\u2014a ratio of almost 10 to 1. health Outcomes improve In addition to financial benefit, physical and mental health services funded by Measure A resulted in measurable positive outcomes for recipients. For example, for patients who attended a health class at Davis Street Community Center, Inc., 63% with a BMI score greater than or equal to 30 saw a drop in score of at least 0.10 points, 50% of hypertensive patients saw a drop in their blood pressure reading to less than 140/90, and 67% of diabetic patients had a post-class Hemoglobin A1C reading that was less than 7.0, a significant indication of controlled diabetes. In addition, due to case management, there was a 93% reduction in the percentage of clients who had been to the emergency room after receiving Asthma Start's case management services. Clients Are Satisfied Recipient surveys reveal a high level of satisfaction with Measure A-funded services. For example, 95% of Senior Support Program of Tri-Valley clients would recommend the program to someone they know. 87% of UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland patients reported they were satisfied or very satisfied with the services they received. Axis Community Health received an overall 95% satisfaction rating, and 100% of families of newborn patients reported that they were satisfied with the services they received at the Center for Early Intervention on Deafness. Providers Exceed Expectations In another example of Measure A funding providing notable bang for the buck, many providers exceeded their targets in services provided, thus improving their service-to-dollar ratio. For example, the City of Fremont Aging and Family Services Health Promoters program assisted 113 older adult clients in accessing and receiving mental health, health, and medically related services, compared to a target of 50. The Senior Injury Prevention Program Enhance Fitness program served 84 participants compared to a target of 11\u2014an increase of 764%\u2014while the Ger-Fit program served 109 participants compared to a target of 13\u2014an increase of 817%. And the LifeLong Medical Center Heart2Heart Axis Community Health Reduction in percentage of clients who had been to the ER after receiving Asthma Start's case management services.93%2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 7program participated in 203 community engagement activities and events compared to a target of 30, and provided health education and services to 644 community members compared to a target of 100. Youth Receive Special Attention Youth populations continue to be a special focus for many Measure A providers, with positive results. The Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) assessment administered to students receiving services through the School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative showed significant improvements in life functioning, behavioral/emotional needs, school success, and child strengths. Among students who received individual or group clinical services, the proportion who experienced depression decreased from 30% at intake to 10% at discharge. Eighty-three percent of youth participating in the Mind Body Awareness program at the Juvenile Justice Center reported a decrease in stress, and 81% reported that they learned positive tools and skills to manage emotions. At Alameda Boys & Girls Club, 725 unduplicated youths participated in Healthy Habits programming. In FY 16/17, the graduation rate for participants in the Spanish Speaking Unity Council of Alameda County, Inc. Latino Men and Boys Program was 95%, compared to the Oakland Unified School District's graduation rate of 45% for Latino boys. general Concerns and Recommendations In developing this report, the Oversight Committee identified several concerns regarding the state of health care funding both during the years of Measure A implementation (2004-2017) and in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, many families, especially those living in disadvantaged communities, have not benefitted from the economic recovery in recent years and face rising housing and living costs, which significantly impact the health of County residents. According to the EveryOne Counts! 2017 Homeless Count and Survey data submitted to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), an estimated 5,629 County residents experiencing homelessness were counted. As the housing and homelessness crisis continues to grow in Alameda County, Measure A continues to play a vital role in providing essential health services to many vulnerable residents, including low income families and seniors. The Committee urges Alameda County to pay close attention to public health policy changes that relate to homelessness and housing affordability that may have significant impacts on health care access or the County's safety net. Moreover, Medi-Cal rate reductions and other Alameda Boys & Girls Club2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 8funding cuts over the past several years have continued to decrease the ability of health providers to offer services to the expanded Medi-Cal and uninsured populations in the County. Realizing the full promise of these reforms presents a significant challenge as the health care delivery system remains fragmented, eligibility systems are cumbersome and difficult to negotiate, and access to care continues to be compromised by low reimbursement rates and a shortage of providers\u2014particularly in primary and preventive care. Measure A will continue to serve as an essential revenue stream in developing creative and innovative ways to improve access to care, lower the cost of care, and improve the patient experience. This in turn helps promote equity in health care service delivery by addressing the root causes of poor health outcomes. RECOMMENDATION: The Board should make a public announcement that Measure A funding is open to all organizations so that eligible organizations become aware of this funding opportunity and learn how to apply. Outside the area of health care funding, the Committee recognizes that the composition of the Committee has improved in reflecting the diverse make-up of the population served by Measure A. RECOMMENDATION: Recruitment of Oversight Committee membership should place an ongoing focus on representing the diverse make-up of the population served by Measure A. Regarding Measure A funding, the Committee raises the following concerns. Note: The Committee believes it is important to present any concerns it noticed while reviewing Measure A recipient reports. At the same time, the Committee wants to make clear that raising a concern does not necessarily mean that a problem exists with a recipient's use of Measure A funds. For example, the concern may arise because of incomplete or inaccurate reporting, not because of any inappropriate use of funds. The Committee expresses an ongoing concern that the County Counsel's interpretation of the Measure A ordinance limits the Committee's ability to review program efficacy and cost-effectiveness. The Oversight Committee believes that the interpretation of the statute must be revised to expand the role of the Committee and appropriately allocate Measure A funds for administrative staff to oversee the contracts and ensure the effective use of public funds to all grantees\u2014via audit or other method. As part of its role in providing fiscal oversight, the Committee recognizes a need for providers and HCSA to work together to San Leandro Senior Services2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 9evaluate the long-term impact of Measure A investments in Alameda County. Although reporting continues to improve, the Committee expresses the ongoing concern that its review is impacted by the varying level of detail provided in fund recipient reports, as well as varying levels of responsiveness to specific questions posed by the Committee to specific recipients. This makes it difficult for the Committee to determine whether funding is being spent on the Measure A target population. For example: - Multiple provider reports listed objectives that are not measurable and/or stated positive outcomes without quantifying the statements. - For some reports, it is unclear whether the target population falls within one of the categories listed in the Measure A statute: \"indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children, families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. \" - In other reports, the provider's description of the services offered raises questions as to their relevance to the wording of the Measure A statute. RECOMMENDATION: HCSA should receive funding to provide training to Measure A recipients to increase their capacity to effectively collect and report demographic data on the clients that they serve and their results-based effort, quality, and impact measures. The Committee further advocates that HCSA be sufficiently staffed to successfully implement such a process. RECOMMENDATION: Organizations that do not provide adequate information may not be considered for future funding. RECOMMENDATION: The Board should authorize HCSA to include evaluations of Measure A programs as part of its initiative to improve oversight and outcomes in selected programs. RECOMMENDATION: Up to 10% of Measure A recipients should undergo a formal audit each year to track whether money is being spent in accordance with the wording and intent of the measure. RECOMMENDATION: To sustain base funding, adequate Measure A reserves should be maintained to address projected decreases in revenue. Multicultural Institute2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 10Specific Concerns Alameda health System In response to questions from the Measure A Oversight Committee, Nancy Kaatz, Interim CFO, and Mr. Terry Lightfoot, Director of Public Affairs and Community Engagement, described Alameda Health System's accounting decision to integrate Measure A dollars ($106,757,190) into their \"overall revenue\" ($969,974,000). Therefore, the Committee was unable to: Determine what portion of Measure A funds were allocated to personnel, subcontracted services, non-personnel program and/or operating expenses, or administrative overhead, separate from their overall agency budget for these categories. Determine what portion of Measure A funds were allocated to the actual number of staff supported, separate from their entire agency staff of 4,148. RECOMMENDATION: Alameda Health System should undergo a full and comprehensive audit to track Measure A fund allocations during the FY16/17 period to ensure public accountability for how the $107 million in tax funds were utilized. If this is not possible, then the auditor should recommend the appropriate accounting and reporting systems that would enable satisfactory tracing of Measure A dollars. genesis Worship Center This provider did not supply any Measure A funding information for FY 16/17, despite repeated calls from Health Care Services Agency staff to obtain this information. Therefore, the Committee cannot evaluate whether funds were spent in accordance with the strictures of Measure A. Center for Early Intervention on Deafness2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 11hOW thE MOnEY WAS SPEnt Measure A tax revenue is used to provide emergency medical, hospital inpatient, outpatient, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children and families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. Each year, the Alameda Health System (AHS) receives 75% of Measure A funds, which is allocated by their Board of Trustees to provide primary and specialty care, preventative, and mental health services to patients served at AHS's multiple facilities, including Highland Hospital, John George Psychiatric Hospital, Fairmont Hospital, San Leandro Hospital, and Alameda Hospital. The remaining 25% of the Measure A funds received is allocated by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors (Board) to provide critical medical services offered by community-based health care providers, emergency care, and public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to address the many health needs of communities throughout the County. In FY 16/17, Measure A generated $142,643,720 (not including interest earned). The funds were allocated as follows:Alameda Health System Alameda County approved budget totaled $2.971 billion. The Alameda County Health Care Services Agency approved budget totaled $728 million, or 24.5% of the total County budget. Measure A revenues not specifically designated for AHS accounted for 1.2%. The following sections in the report provide more detail on how AHS and the Board spent Measure A funds in FY 16/17, which includes revenue generated in the reporting year as well as unspent funds earned in previous years.Alameda County Board of Supervisors Alameda Health System Board of Trustees25% 75%25%DiStRiBUtiOn OF individuals served: 122,636) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families, SeniorsServices provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Inpatient, Hospital Outpatient, Public Health, Mental Health, Substance Abuse Service area: Countywide, Homeless or transient Background Alameda Health System (AHS) is a patient- and family-centered system of care that promotes wellness, eliminates disparities, and optimizes the health of its diverse communities. AHS program objectives are guided by a three- to five-year strategic plan, which is built on the following pillars: Access: Increase total clinic visits from 297,289 to 350,152 Quality: Eliminate preventable harm Service: Improve the patient experience Sustainability: Achieve an Earnings Before Interest, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBIDA) margin of 6.8% Workforce Development: Reduce the number of managers receiving low employee engagement scores The AHS Complex Care Program is a multidisciplinary team of registered nurse care managers, social workers, and community health workers that serve AHS patients with multiple chronic conditions who frequently use the emergency department (ED) as their source of primary care. The program's goal is to help patients gain the confidence and skill they need to succeed, to make sure their care is well coordinated, and that they have tools for success. Program services include social support and tangible needs, coordination of and access to services, self-management and mental health, and medical status and health trajectory. These categories include assistance in placing patients in temporary or permanent housing, monitoring their nutrition, and ensuring delivery of fresh food. Measure A Funding Summary Measure A is a supplemental revenue source for AHS, reducing the gap between reimbursement for services from a variety of sources and the FY 16/17: 75% Of Measure A Funds Allocated to Alameda health System alamedahealthsystem.org Matching Funds $23.8 M AHS leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain $23,835,950 in matching federal funds. 2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 12actual cost of providing those services to underinsured and uninsured persons.

If this is not possible, then the auditor should recommend the appropriate accounting and reporting systems that would enable satisfactory tracing of Measure A dollars. 2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 14FUNDS ALLOCATED BY THE ALAMEDA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS GROUP 1: BEHAVIORAL HEALTH Behavioral Health and Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Community ............................................................. 16 Center for Healthy Schools and Communities (School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative) .............. 17 Criminal Justice Screening and In-Custody Services .......................................................................................... 20 Detoxification/Sobering Center ................................................................................................................................. 24 Health Services for Unaccompanied Immigrant Youth: La Familia Counseling Services ..................... 25 La Familia Counseling Services ................................................................................................................................ 26 Mental Health Services for Juvenile Justice Center ............................................................................................ 27 Mental Health Services for Newcomers and Immigrants (CERI) ................................................................... 28 Safe Alternatives to Violent Environments (SAVE) ............................................................................................. 29 Senior Support Program of Tri-Valley ...................................................................................................................... 30 2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 15Background Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) works to maximize the recovery, resilience, and wellness of all eligible Alameda County residents who are developing or experience serious mental health, alcohol, or drug concerns. Community-based organizations (CBOs) provide mental health and substance use disorder services under contract with BHCS to meet the diverse cultural and language needs of County resident populations. Measure A Funding Summary Measure A funds were used to support seven mental health and 19 substance use disorder programs. Funds were roughly evenly distributed between mental health and alcohol and other drug (AOD) programs. Providers used Measure A funds to support expansion in service operations and administrative needs, and to address cost increases not sufficiently covered by standard cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) provided by their contracts. The use of Measure A funds to mitigate budget cuts allowed providers to serve approximately the same number of County residents in substance user disorder programs as prior years, despite unavoidable cost increases for insurance, utilities, and other non-service-related operational expenses. These additional funds contributed to significant client-level outcomes, such as service continuity, outreach effectiveness, and client engagement in treatment objectives that would be put at risk by cutbacks in provider service capacity.FY 16/17 Allocation: $775,848 | Expended/Encumbered: $505,760 individuals served 10,000 (Total individuals served: 36,000) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families, SeniorsServices provided: Mental Health, Substance Abuse Service area: BerkeleyBehavioral health and Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Community www.acbhcs.org Matching Funds $25,003 from the Medi- Cal and the Medi- Cal Administrative Activities (MAA) programs. 2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 16FY 16/17 Allocation: $622,356 | Expended/Encumbered: individuals served: 4,563) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, FamiliesServices provided: Mental Health, Substance Abuse Service area: Ashland, Castro Valley, Cherryland, Dublin, Emeryville, Hayward, Livermore, Newark, Oakland, Pleasanton, San Leandro, San Lorenzo, Union City, Homeless or transient Background The Center for Healthy Schools and Communities (CHSC) works to foster the academic success, health, and well-being of Alameda County youth by building universal access to high quality supports and opportunities in schools and neighborhoods. Co-coordinated by CHSC and the Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) Agency, the Alameda County School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative strengthens the use of evidence-based practices along a continuum of behavioral health supports that includes prevention, early intervention, and treatment strategies. CHSC and BHCS used their Measure A allocation to enhance a core program of the Alameda County School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative: the Our Kids Our Families Program, District Behavioral Health Consultation program. The main objective of the initiative is to implement and strengthen this program in the following school districts: Emery Unified Newark Unified New Haven Unified Dublin Unified Livermore Valley Joint Unified Oakland Unified Pleasanton Unified San Leandro Unified Hayward Unified The Our Kids Our Families program, provided at 29 school sites in the Hayward and Oakland Unified School Districts, is a school-based behavioral health program that fosters social-emotional wellness in an Center for healthy Schools and Communities (School-Based Behavioral health initiative) achealthyschools.org Matching Funds $6,016,022 from the following sources: Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and treatment (EPSD t) funding, hayward: $1,345,957 Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and treatment (EPSD t) funding, Oakland: $2,133,989 T obacco intervention Program: $412,866 of Oakland, Oakland Unite: $200,000 School District funding: $110,098 2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 17educational environment so that children and families feel connected, safe, and supported in school. The program supports prevention efforts at the school sites, as well as early intervention and treatment services for any student and their family that needs it. The School District Consultation program places behavioral health consultants (BHCs) in school districts to provide and enhance preventive social-emotional supports and mental health services for students and their families. The services provided by BHCs included the following: Assess the social-emotional service needs and infrastructure of a school district or set of schools and develop a service plan Coordinate the work of all partner agencies who deliver behavioral health services in schools and districts Provide and/or coordinate clinical case management, group and individual counseling, and crisis assessment and intervention to students Provide workshops, parenting groups, mental health and other appropriate consultation, and linkages to needed school and community resources to parents/caregivers Measure A Funding Summary The School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative used its Measure A allocation to support the following activities through the Our Kids Our Families Program, District Behavioral Health Consultation program. Prevention Activities BHCs in all eight school districts were responsible for planning and/or implementing evidence-based prevention programs that promote social/emotional learning (SEL) among students and SEL application among adults, including the following: Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) Restorative justice Mental health consultations with teachers, staff, parents, and students Classroom-based SEL curriculum and instruction BHCs also provided a variety of non-clinical preventative services to students, families, and teachers and other staff at schools and schools districts. These services included the following: Youth groups (5,246 youth seved) Teacher consultations (3,601 teachers served) Staff presentations (1,456 staff served) Individual mentorship/drop-ins with youth (1,299 youth served) Family groups/workshops (115 families served)highlights In surveys of youth receiving behavioral health services in the School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative, 100% reported improvements in their access to an individual who can help them in a crisis. In surveys of parents whose students had received services, 99% who participated in parent/family engagement workshops reported that the information addressed their needs and will help them as parents. Among students who received individual or group clinical services, the proportion who experienced depression decreased from 30% at intake to 10% at discharge. 100% 99% 20% 2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 18Early Intervention and Treatment Strategies BHCs performed several roles and responsibilities to strengthen the quality of early intervention and treatment programs in all school districts: In all districts, BHCs served as key point persons for responding to behavioral health crises at school sites. BHCs either directly provided crisis response services or coordinated crisis response. In FY 16/17, BHCs provided crisis assessment services to 265 youth. In addition to overseeing Clinical Case Managers in Oakland and Hayward, BHCs provided direct supervision and/or coordination of graduate level Social Work and MFT interns in the Emery, Newark, New Haven, San Leandro, and Hayward Unified School Districts. The Our Kids Our Families Intern Program supervised a total of 18 social work and MFT interns. During FY 16/17, 4,563 students were provided with 152,433 hours of clinical services through the program. In FY 16/17, BHCs coordinated SEL initiatives at all eight school districts supported by Measure A funds. Emery, Newark, and Hayward school districts received funding to implement a PBIS framework in every school. As a result of this work, PBIS was implemented in 18 of 21 schools in Hayward and four of 13 schools in Newark. BHCs also supported quality improvements of San Leandro's PBIS initiative, which was implemented in every school in the district. BHCs also supported other SEL and restorative justice resources in school districts, such as implementing restorative justice coordinators at all secondary schools in Hayward, and developing Parent Ambassador and Student Ambassador programs to support engagement in district planning efforts. BHCs also supported the adoption of SEL curriculums in the Emery, San Leandro, and Dublin school districts. BHCs implemented Coordination of Services Teams (COST) and other referral mechanisms for behavioral health supports. During FY 16/17, BHCs supported the implementation of COST in 204 schools in 13 school districts. COSTs at these schools received over 8,861 student referrals during the year. Approximately 69% of all students (or 6,098) referred to COST were connected to critical behavioral health services. Success Story A student was referred to prevention and early intervention services due to concerns around his arguing with teachers, anger outbursts, and peer conflicts. The COST team, teachers, and staff developed a plan to support this student inside and outside of the classroom. The school also collaborated with the student's parents. The student was not willing to engage in services/treatment outside of school, but showed more interest in services provided at the school. Prevention and early intervention services included building a rapport with the student and developing emotional awareness and coping skills. Eventually, the student demonstrated a more positive outlook toward counseling and was linked to an outside provider for treatment. 2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 19Background Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) works to maximize the recovery, resilience, and wellness of all eligible Alameda County residents who are developing or experience serious mental health, alcohol, or drug concerns.

SRH works in partnership with physicians and employees to heal and comfort all those it serves. SRH is a safety-net, independent, nonprofit hospital that provides critical access to emergency medical, hospital inpatient, and outpatient services for indigent, low income, underinsured populations in Central and Southern Alameda County. These services include the following: Critical access. SRH serves as a critical access point for Alameda County and is the only Medi-Cal-contracted facility between Oakland and Fremont. Additionally, SRH serves as a safety-net hospital and provides health care access to many low income residents that do not have adequate transportation to the Alameda County Medical Center. Hospitalists programs. The Hospitalists assume care of indigent and uninsured patients who are admitted to SRH. This alleviates the financial impact of private physicians who request compensation for lack of reimbursement. Women's services. SRH subsidizes the Women's Center to meet the growing demand for OB/GYN services in the community, because many OB practitioners do not accept Medi-Cal rates. The program provides immediate and emergency care for pregnant women who present to the emergency room (ER), often with no history of prenatal care. Cardiac care. SRH is the only Medi-Cal-contracted facility to provide elective cardiac and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) services in Central Alameda County. SRH routinely accepts hospital transfers for emergency and elective cardiac care from non-Medi-Cal providers. Tele-Psychiatry. SRH started a Tele-Psychiatry program for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with mental health issues.

Specifically, SRH used its Measure A allocation to help achieve the following: Conduct over 3,770 patient encounters and provide over $3.2 million in cost of care to uninsured/indigent patients For both traditional and Managed Care Medi-Cal programs, conduct over 25,200 patient encounters and incur over $30.4 million of costs in excess of amounts Experience 31,448 ER visits, including 69%, or 21,759 visits, from uninsured and underinsured patients (target: 23,500) Provide financial support to hospital-based physicians to take ER call and provide services to 11,217 uninsured/underinsured patients (target: 12,100) Support uninsured and underinsured patients (target: 3,000) Success Story After a 29-year-old Hispanic male had surgery at SRH for acute appendicitis, his wife wrote: \"Our family is so [grateful] for the opportunity for my husband to be treated at St. Rose Hospital. We were uninsured and thought that we would be sent away from St. Rose Hospital. We are living with my husband's family. We do not have any other place to live ... and we have to pay our rent so that the four of us do not have to become homeless. My husband's family relies on us to pay our rent so that they can buy food for the household.

At CHO, Measure A funding supported three programs/activities: The pediatric Emergency Department (ED), specifically to provide adequate staffing for the large volume of children seen at the ED The Center for Child Protection (CCP), which treats children who experience abuse and other types of trauma Two school-based clinics in Oakland Emergency Department CHO provides highly specialized pediatric emergency services for the children of Alameda County, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. CHO's ED sees a broad array of pediatric disease and injury from the basic to the most complex. CHO is the leading provider for Alameda County children in need of acute care. Children with Medi-Cal rely nearly exclusively on CHO for emergency services since the public hospitals in the area do not provide specialized pediatric care and do not have any beds for children in the event a child needs to stay overnight. In FY 16/17, to CHO's ED was the highest volume ED in the San Francisco Bay Area. Trauma services are a subset of the ED, requiring highly specialized equipment, facilities, and highly trained staff. CHO's ED is one of two designated Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Centers in Northern California and the only one in the Bay Area. Children's Trauma Center has 24-hour in-house staff including pediatric specialists in emergency medicine, trauma surgery, anesthesiology, neurosurgery, orthopedics, diagnostic imaging, and critical care. CHO maintains an extensive in-house and outpatient rehabilitation department for pediatric trauma patients. The Trauma Center also supports an injury prevention program for the hospital and the community.

Approximately 70% of patients seen in the CHO ED receive Medi-Cal. This number is higher than almost any other hospital\u2014child or adult\u2014in California. Without the CHO ED, children would need to travel further and/or receive care that is not specialized to children. With little doubt, more children would die without the CHO ED. Center for Child ProtectionCHO and Alameda County recognize that they share a responsibility to provide immediate and comprehensive care for this population of children, yet there are many challenges to maintaining this responsibility. CCP serves more than 600 clients per year. CCP is a comprehensive child abuse program within CHO. CCP is the only provider in Alameda County that has the capacity to offer many of its services. Because many CCP services are funded by external sources such as Measure A, there is no charge for eligible clients. This feature is very important because if CCP needed to charge insurance for these services, there would be a record of services provided, and many families would not step forward to divulge such sensitive information. CCP maintains staffing 24 hours per day to respond to acute forensic examinations for children under 14 years old when the alleged sexual abuse occurred within 72 hours. Non-acute forensic examinations for children under age 18 and second opinion medical consults are performed in the CCP outpatient clinic through appointment only. Clinical case management is provided to children and adolescents who present to the ED and/or child abuse management clinic following diagnosis or disclosure of abuse. Clinical case management assists families with navigating the criminal justice system, arranging necessary medical follow-up, and assisting with community resource referrals. Comprehensive evidenced-based mental health services are provided to children, adolescents, and their families. For most of these families, there are no alternatives in Alameda County for many of the services provided by CCP. School-Based ClinicsCHO runs two school-based health centers: one at Castlemont High School and one at McClymonds High School. Both sites are integrated into full-service youth and/or family centers that promote youth development and serve as national models for adolescent health care.

The Castlemont site is now the highest volume school-connected mental health site in Alameda County. The sites' School-Based Mental Health Program has become a national model for the integration of medical and mental health care, and it has been cited for success at addressing underlying social stressors related to mental health. The program has developed a training and consultation program for school professionals and mental health providers who work with schools, and it has contracts to conduct trainings throughout Alameda County and California. Measure A Funding Summary CHO used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following: Emergency Department In FY 16/17, there were a total of 46,380 visits to the ED. 451 of these visits were trauma cases where the child faced an immediate life-threatening situation. The average length of stay for patients discharged from the ED was reduced to 2.91 hours, compared to 3.1 hours three years previously (target: <3 hours). Center for Child Protection In FY 16/17, the CCP provided forensic medical and/or mental health services for more than 600 children and their families (target: 600). All children and youth presenting through the ED and/or Child Abuse Management clinic for forensic medical care received crisis intervention and a corresponding needs assessment. 90% of children referred internally for psychotherapy services began service engagement within one week of the referral. 124 children participated in individual therapy. 32 children participated in group therapy. 85% of children participating in therapy demonstrated enhanced intrapersonal and interpersonal functioning. 100% of children who received Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy demonstrated clinical progress (target: 100%). School-Based Clinics In FY 16/17, the two clinics run by CHO had a total of 6,735 encounters and saw 947 unique patients.in FY 16/17, there were a total of 46,380 visits to the ED. 2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 36FUNDS ALLOCATED BY THE ALAMEDA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS GROUP 3: PRIMARY CARE Alameda County Dental Health ................................................................................................................................. 38 Axis Community Health ................................................................................................................................................ 40 Center for Elders' Independence ............................................................................................................................... 41 Center for Healthy Schools and Communities (School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative) .............. 42 Connecting Kids to Coverage (CKC) Initiative ...................................................................................................... 46 Davis Street Community Center, Inc. ........................................................................................................................ 49 Health Aging and Family Services ............................................................................................................................ 50 Health Enrollment for Children ................................................................................................................................. 52 Health Services for Day Laborers: Community Initiatives (Day Labor Center) .......................................... 53 Health Services for Day Laborers: Multicultural Institute ................................................................................ 55 Health Services for Day Laborers: Street Level Health Project ...................................................................... 57 Increase Hospice Utilization ....................................................................................................................................... 59 Medical Costs for Juvenile Justice Center: Direct Service Planning and Administration ...................... 60 Medical Costs for Juvenile Justice Center: Mind Body Awareness ................................................................. 62 Medical Costs for Juvenile Justice Center: Niroga Institute ............................................................................ 63 Medical Costs for Juvenile Justice Center: Victims of Crime ............................................................................ 64 Native American Health Center ................................................................................................................................. 66 Preventive Care Pathways ........................................................................................................................................... 67 Primary Care Community-Based Organizations ................................................................................................... 68 Roots Community Health Center ............................................................................................................................... 71 Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center, Inc. ........................................................................................................................ 73 Washington Hospital ..................................................................................................................................................... 75 2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 37Background The Alameda County Public Health Department works in partnership with the community to ensure the optimal health and well-being of all people through a dynamic and responsive process that respects the diversity of the community and works to provide for present and future generations. The Alameda County Office of Dental Health provides an accessible early entry point for oral health assessment and preventive dental services for high risk families and children ages 0-5 years at Women, Infants, and Children centers (WIC), as well as continuity and referral for regular follow-up dental care in the community. The services provided at WIC include dental history interviews to identify risk factors and oral home care practices, brushing the child's teeth and applying fluoride, assessing the child's mouth, defining and gaining acceptance for home care behaviors, and promoting the oral health of prenatal women and their newborns. For children who need follow-up care beyond the services provided at the WIC site, the outreach worker collaborates with the family to assess insurance coverage, obtain a dental appointment with a provider, and assist with making the initial dental appointment. For families lacking insurance coverage, the outreach worker arranges insurance assistance through the Healthy Smiles Dental Treatment program. The focus of the service is to families of children (ages 9 to 15 months) who participate in Dental Days at WIC at the Eastmont, Telegraph, Hayward, and Fremont sites. Since siblings often accompany the caregiver at the Dental Days, all services are offered to them as well.FY 16/17 Allocation: $257,580 | Expended/Encumbered: individuals served: 6,052) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families Services provided: Public Health Service area: Alameda, Ashland, Berkeley, Castro Valley, Cherryland, Fairview, Fremont, Hayward, Newark, Oakland, San Leandro, San Lorenzo, Union CityAlameda County Dental health www.acphd.org/dental-administration.aspx Matching Funds $257,580 from the Maternal, Child and Adolescent health Program (MCAh) and Child health and Disability Prevention (ChDP). 2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 38Measure A Funding Summary Measure A funding helped the Office of Dental Health achieve the following: Provide oral health education to 922 parents/guardians through WIC Dental Days (target: at least 1,000) Provide oral health assessments to 856 infants/children 0-5 years old through WIC Dental Days (target: at least 900) Screen 1,205 students at the school-based program (target: 1,050) Provide fluoride varnish to WIC Dental Days (target: 100%) Provide 80% of parents whose children received a dental assessment and need a dental provider with care coordination and assistance towards making an appointment with a dental provider (target: 100%) Enroll 84% of infants and children receiving an oral health assessment into the Healthy Kids Healthy Teeth (HKHT) program and link them to a dental home (target: at least 75%) Success Story At a WIC Dental Day, a Laotian mother informed the Community Health Outreach Worker (CHOW) and Registered Dental Assistant (RDA) that her four-year-old daughter had been complaining of tooth pain but did not have dental insurance.

Implemented in the Oakland, Hayward, and San Leandro school districts, the initiative aims to eliminate common barriers to health-insurance enrollment and retention by leveraging school districts as channels for reaching uninsured families. The CKC Initiative centralizes enrollment assistance in school district- based Central Family Resource Centers so that families can apply for and renew their health-care coverage and public benefits in a \"one-stop shop, \" minimizing visits to multiple County offices. The initiative is a collaboration among the Alameda County Social Services Agency; the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA); three of the County's largest school districts; and two community-based organizations. A majority of consumers accessing assistance are Latino and Spanish- speaking and reside in Oakland, the largest school district participating in the initiative. Most families have qualified for two or more affordable coverage programs, indicating that the \"one-stop shop\" model is of particular value for these families. The CKC \"one-stop shop\" model is particularly important for the working poor, whose demanding and inflexible work schedules and difficulty accessing reliable or efficient transportation can prevent them from making or attending appointments at different public agency locations for each family member. The CKC Initiative utilizes three primary strategies to reach its target populations: Trainings or presentations for school site staff, community-based partners, or other school-based resources to increase the number of people at school sites who are referring families in need to the CKC Family Resource Centers for health benefit enrollment assistance.

MI's core constituencies are Latino immigrant families and other low income youth and adults lacking access to critical services. Its programs are focused on historically disadvantaged groups in neighborhoods in Alameda and other counties. The Life Skills/Day Laborer Program offers comprehensive wraparound services focused on improving the economic and social lives of Alameda County day laborers and other low income families. In addition, MI contributes to health awareness and prevention by offering health education, referrals, screenings and health services. In addition to health referrals, services, and educational workshops, participants also benefit from the following: Culturally and linguistically appropriate street outreach. In MI's on-the-street model, staff accompanies day laborers every morning while they look for work in West Berkeley. This approach allows for services to trickle down to those that otherwise would not seek out these services. Referrals and job placements often occur at the street corners. This program also works with local officials and area businesses to ensure that the area is safe, that workers have access to trash receptacles and portable bathrooms, and that there is no harassment of workers. Workforce development and job placement assistance. This program offers day laborers job matching services at no cost. They are connected to employers for short-term, long-term, and permanent jobs at a minimum of $20/hour.

After his initial checkup, he was referred to Highland Hospital, where he had two surgeries: one for cataracts and the other on his retina. Thanks to him enrolling in HealthPAC and his referral from the mobile van, he paid nothing to receive these services. His vision is better and currently there is no risk of him losing his eyesight. 2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 56Background Street Level Health Project is an Oakland-based health center dedicated to improving the health and well-being of underserved urban immigrant communities in the Bay Area. Twenty-two percent of Street Level Health's new patients had not seen a doctor in over five years, and 61% of patients were uninsured. The Street Level Health Access Program is a critical entry point to the health care and social service system for a vulnerable population excluded in Alameda County. Many of the community members that access Street Level Health face a multitude of barriers that include issues related to language and literacy skills, legal status, unemployment, and lost work opportunities due to long wait times at Federally Qualified Health Centers. Street Level Health's Whole Person Care Model strives to combat these barriers by prioritizing Mam language interpretation as part of its free, twice-weekly health screenings, drop-in health navigation, and onsite health enrollment. In response to the issues related to food access and malnutrition in the community, the Health Access Program provides a nutritious, twice-weekly lunch service. Mental health awareness has been an area of focus this year due to heightened immigration enforcement in the community. Street Level's Mental Health team initiated a five-week seminar series to provide guidance on how to reduce stress and establish internal peace. Participants found the sessions to be a safe place to share personal stories and learn the ways of reducing stress, such as meditation and breathing exercises.FY 16/17 Allocation: $89,301 | Expended/Encumbered: individuals served: 742) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Families, Seniors Services provided: Public Health, Mental Health Service area: Countywide health Services for Day Laborers: Street Level health Project streetlevelhealth.org highlights Street Level Health met or exceeded its targets in all areas\u2014for example, distributing 2,292 free bags of fruits and vegetables to 456 low income households, compared to a target of 2,000 bags to 400 households.2,292 2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 57Measure A Funding Summary Measure A funding helped Street Level Health Project achieve the following: Provide 1,130 health care screening and episodic care visits to 676 clients across multiple languages (target: 1,200 screenings/visits to 750 clients) Offer 2,785 health-related navigation and referral services across 76 local health care agencies (target: 2,100) Provide 347 mental health consultations to 181 low income clients (target: 125 consultations) Provide 247 nutritionist/herbalist consultations to 180 clients (target: 100 consultations) Distribute 2,292 free healthy fruit and vegetable food bags to 456 low income households (target: 2,000 bags to 400 households) Recruit and train 26 prospective and current health care providers to provide them with experience working with uninsured low income communities (target: 25) Provide medical service in the same day to 96% of clients who checked in to the clinic (target: 95%) Refer 80% of clients who had no health care coverage to the enrollment worker (target: 75%) Provide information on how to access services to 90% of clients who screened positively for unmet mental health needs (target: 80%) Provide a glucose screening at first visit to 84% of clients who reported a family history of diabetes (target: 60%) Success Story Yolanda came to Street Level Health to address issues that were not being taken seriously by her current primary care provider. During her visit, Yolanda received a health screening, a nutritionist/herbalist consultation, and a mental health consultation. The mental health consultation revealed that Yolanda was undergoing extreme anxiety and difficulty managing her stress after her son was murdered two months prior. The fear and pain from this tragic event were in addition to her medical issues. Yolanda was immediately referred to Casa del Sol for further evaluation and treatment. She was also set up with a care plan at Highland Hospital and Street Level Health for continuous medical treatment. 2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 58Background The Alameda County Getting the Most Out of Life (GMOL) program is designed to reduce suffering and improve quality of care for terminally ill residents of Alameda County.

The Alameda Health Consortium is guided by the following principles: All people have the right to accessible and affordable high quality health care that prevents illness, promotes wellness, and is sensitive to the unique needs of particular communities and cultures. The barriers that prevent people from seeking care must be eliminated. Individuals and families must be empowered to participate in their own health care. Low income and underserved people play an important role in the formation of health policy at the local, state, and national level. Building consensus and coalitions around important health issues leads to innovative solutions. Providing quality health care improves the well-being of our communities. Racial and ethnic health disparities must be eliminated in order to have healthy communities. The Consortium's outpatient services are provided at community health center locations throughout Alameda County and are not hospital-based. The health centers see patients regardless of income, insurance, or immigration status. In addition to providing medical, dental, and behavioral health care, the health centers provide a wide range of support services to improve the lives of patients served. More than 20 different languages are spoken across the health centers. 2016 -2017 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 68The Alameda Health Consortium's eight member health centers are the following: Asian Health Services Axis Community Health La Clinica LifeLong Medical Care Native American Health Center Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center Tri-City Health Center West Oakland Health Council Measure A Funding Summary The eight Alameda Health Consortium member health centers used their Measure A allocation to ensure that low income uninsured Alameda County residents have access to affordable health care at community health centers under the Health Program of Alameda County (HealthPAC). The funds enable the health centers to provide essential medical services to HealthPAC enrollees, as well as health insurance enrollment assistance for the uninsured. Specifically, Measure A funding helped Consortium member community health centers achieve the following: 16,634 low income Alameda County residents made a total of 63,159 service visits to access quality services through HealthPAC. 18,660 low income residents were enrolled in HealthPAC at one of the health centers. Across three health centers, 39,465 patient screenings for HIV and 12,183 for Hepatitis C were conducted. Twelve Community Health Workers were added across the health centers, increasing their capacity to support more than 800 medically complex patients. LifeLong Medical Care opened a primary care health center site in Pinole, increasing patient access to services. Two cohorts totaling 18 primary care professionals from across the consortium completed the UC Davis Primary Care Psychiatry Fellows program to better manage behavioral health patients with complex needs. Three primary care professionals participated in the UC Davis Pain Management Fellows Program to increase provider capacity in the area of pain management and opioid addiction. The Training and Technical Assistance program for behavioral health clinicians continued to grow to support primary care and behavioral health integration at all health centers. Data sharing between specialty mental health providers and primary care providers was improved to work towards a whole-person care approach when caring for behavioral health patients. Success Story A young female patient came to America from Mexico alone in search of a better life. With no family support, she was at a loss when she became pregnant. Through community members, she learned about LifeLong Medical Care. At LifeLong, she gained access to prenatal care and learned how to manage a healthy pregnancy.
