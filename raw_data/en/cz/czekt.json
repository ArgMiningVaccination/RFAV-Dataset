To avoid a large outbreak, vaccines are administered preferably as quickly as possible. However, in the early stages of an outbreak the information on the disease is limited and waiting with the intervention allows to design a more tailored vaccination strategy. In this paper we study the resulting tradeo between timing of vaccination and the e ectiveness of the response. We model disease progression using the seminal SIR model, and consider a decision maker who allocates her budget over two vaccine types: an early aspeci c vaccine and a later speci c vaccine. We analytically characterize the switching curve separating the parameter space region where the late speci c vaccine is preferred from the region where the early aspeci c type is preferred. More importantly, we show that the decision maker should not only consider pure strategies, i.e., strategies which spend the entire budget on one of the types. Instead, she should suitably invest in both vaccine types to bene t both from the early response and from the good vaccine. We prove that at the switching curve, such ahybrid strategy is strictly better than either of the pure strategies due to the non-linear dynamics of epidemics. Numerical experiments show that the associated bene t of hybrid strategies over pure strategies in terms of reduction of the number of infections may be more than 50%. Such experiments also substantiate our restriction to two vaccine types.

As an infectious disease can spread quickly through a population, the earlier people can be immunized, the better. However, an e ective response strategy cannot always be started directly, either because the characteristics of the outbreak are not yet known or because it takes time to produce and distribute the right vaccines. Thus policy makers face a trade-o between the timing of vaccination and the e ectiveness of the response. The e ectiveness of the response is related to the e\u000ecacy of a vaccine, which is a measure of relative risk in a vaccinated group compared to an unvaccinated control group. The higher the e\u000ecacy of a vaccine, the better the vaccine is able to achieve immunity in the vaccinee. There are numerous practical situations where policy makers have to make a trade o between the e\u000ecacy of vaccines and the timing of vaccination. Here are three examples: 1. The production for the annual in uenza vaccine starts well before the in uenza season starts. That implies that detailed knowledge about the characteristics of the annual u is missing and that it is di\u000ecult to design a good vaccine. Policy makers face a `commit-or-defer' decision: either they should decide on the vaccine composition early with little knowledge available, or they decide to defer the decision in order to learn more about the coming in uenza season (e.g., Cho, 2010; Kornish & Keeney, 2008). Quick decisions have the advantage of having the vaccines available early, but deferring could lead to vaccines with a higher e\u000ecacy. 2. Whereas the annual in uenza is expected, an unexpected outbreak of in uenza can also occur, poten- tially resulting in a pandemic. In those situations policy makers have to determine how to respond. They can often choose among multiple vaccine types: vaccines with a high e\u000ecacy or vaccines with a lower e\u000ecacy. The latter might seem worse, but might have a lower price, a shorter delivery time or may be available in larger quantities. Nguyen and Carlson (2016) vary the time at which vaccines become available and the stockpile size to determine the e ects on the epidemic. 3. For some vaccines a single dose only results in limited protection. To bene t fully from the vaccine, you need multiple doses, a number of days apart. When a certain number of doses of vaccine is available, policy makers have to decide how this vaccine stockpile should be allocated: they can either give a large number of people a single dose, or two doses to half of the group (Matrajt, Britton, Halloran, & Longini, 2015). It may not be obvious how timing of vaccination plays a role in this example. But 2the fact that there is a xed time in between two doses implies that the epidemic can spread between the rst and the second dose. A one-dose strategy thus corresponds to a quick response, whereas a two-dose strategy has a higher e\u000ecacy. In this paper we synthesize these di erent decision problems and formulate a general problem that encapsulates all three examples. We formulate this general problem in terms of example 2, but the other examples can analogously be analyzed. We consider a policy maker who has a limited budget to ght an outbreak of an infectious disease. The budget can be spent on di erent vaccine types that di er in the time at which they are available and in their e\u000ecacy. The simplest example on which most of our research focuses is the case of two vaccine types: type 1 is an early aspeci c vaccine, which has a low e\u000ecacy, and type 2 is a late speci c vaccine, which has a high e\u000ecacy. We analyze for which combinations of parameters (e\u000ecacy, moment of availability) the late speci c vaccine is preferred over the early aspeci c vaccine. We rst prove a rather intuitive result: the existence of a switching curve which separates the region in the parameter space where the late speci c vaccine is preferred from the region where the early aspeci c type is preferred. In this paper we give an analytical expression characterizing this curve. More importantly, we show that the decision maker should not only consider spending her entire budget on one of the vaccine types. Instead, she should suitable invest in both vaccine types to bene t both from the early response and from the good vaccine. Such a hybrid strategy is not well taken up in literature, although some national pandemic response plans propose a similar strategy by emphasizing the importance of investing in stockpiles of vaccines for known virus types as well as expanding the vaccine manufacturing capacity for the production of pandemic vaccines tailored to the speci c virus (Homeland Security Council, 2006; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2005). Our main contribution in this paper is formally proposing and analyzing such hybrid strategies. We characterize the areas in the parameter space where either of the two pure strategies or the hybrid strategy is optimal. We prove that there is an area around the switching curve where hybrid strategies are superior to pure strategies. We argue that this is due to the non-linear dynamics of an epidemic: By using both vaccine types the early vaccine can be used to reduce the initial growth in infections, while the better vaccine is used to control the epidemic. Our numerical results show that a hybrid strategy can reduce the number of infections by more than 50% compared to the best pure strategy. We note that because our formulation generalizes examples 1-3 above, our analysis of hybrid strategies contributes to three streams of literature (see Section 2. In this article we focus on the most interesting case of hybrid strategies, namely those with two vaccine 3types. Our numerical results show that this choice is not restrictive, as hybrid strategies with more than two vaccine types are not bene cial. Moreover, our results can also be applied to vaccines that become available in batches instead of instantaneously. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. We start with a literature review in Section 2. In Section 3 we formally de ne the vaccination problem. This problem is analyzed in Section 4: we compare the two vaccine types and analyze hybrid strategies. In Section 5 we derive our numerical results. We close with a discussion and conclusions in Section 6. 2 Literature Extant literature considers the trade-o between timing of vaccination and vaccine e\u000ecacy in three separate practical settings. We now rst discuss literature in the setting of the annual in uenza vaccine, then literature on the e ects of timing of vaccination and nally literature on the number of doses to use. Timing of vaccination is part of a much broader stream of literature on vaccine logistics. For a recent overview we refer to Duijzer, van Jaarsveld, and Dekker (2017). Annual in uenza vaccine The trade-o between timing and e\u000ecacy is well studied for the annual in uenza vaccine. There exist multiple types of the in uenza virus and mutations might lead to new types. Every year the World Health Organization (WHO) advices on the composition of the in uenza vaccine (Silva et al., 2015), i.e., which virus types to include in the vaccine. To produce a su\u000ecient number of doses, the composition of the vaccine must be determined well before the in uenza season starts. Wu, Wein, and Perelson (2005) discuss the `follow policy', where the forecasted epidemic strain is included in the annual vaccine. The authors investigate whether this policy can be improved by including information on the strains to which the individual has been exposed in the past. The results conclude that the follow policy is only slightly suboptimal and is therefore recommended to be continued. Kornish and Keeney (2008) study when it is bene cial to defer the decision on the vaccine composition in order to buy time to gather more information about the coming in uenza season. Deferring reduces uncertainty and could lead to better decisions on which strains to include in the vaccine. However, waiting too long reduces the available time for production, potentially leading to higher production costs. The authors assume that they can estimate the number of cases during the outbreak, based on the information at the current time. The authors formulate a commit-or-defer model and derive conditions on the optimal decision using dynamic programming. When 4discussing their model assumptions the authors mention the disadvantage of waiting with production while gathering information on one of the strains that are included in the vaccine. They suggest a solution in which production of the other strains could start earlier and the new strain is only added to the vaccines subsequently produced. This solution can be seen as some kind of hybrid strategy, but the strategy is not formally analyzed by the authors. Cho (2010) extend the work of Kornish and Keeney (2008) by including production yield uncertainties. Decision makers have to decide on retaining the current vaccine or shifting to updated compositions. The latter may have more production yield uncertainty. A discrete time model is proposed with three possible decisions at every time: select the current vaccine strain, update to the most prevalent new strain or postpone decision making to the next period. \u007fOzalt\u0010n, Prokopyev, Schaefer, and Roberts (2011) allow for choosing among multiple possible strains for the vaccine, not only the most prevalent one. The authors use parameters to quantify the proportion of the population that got infected caused by a certain in uenza strain. A multi- stage stochastic mixed integer model is formulated to integrate the composition decision and the timing of this decision. The results show that selecting a less prevalent strain might be bene cial, if this strain has higher production yields for example. All papers on the in uenza composition decision consider only situations in which all vaccines are of the same type. In other words, the policy maker either decides to `commit' or to `defer'. A hybrid strategy, in which the decision maker commits for part of the budget and defers for the remaining budget, are not analyzed apart from the brief discussion in Kornish and Keeney (2008). Timing of vaccination The second example of a trade-o between timing and e\u000ecacy is the selection among multiple vaccine types with di erent delivery times. Matrajt and Longini Jr (2010) study a related problem and compare multiple moments of vaccination and di erent available stockpiles. Their results show how the vaccine stockpile size and the moment at which this stockpile becomes available a ect the optimal allocation over the di erent age-groups and risk-groups. A similar setting is studied by Matrajt, Halloran, and Longini Jr (2013), who focus on a network of cities connected by an airline network instead of a single population. Motivated by practical considerations they shortly discuss the case of vaccines that arrive in two batches, with xed amounts of vaccines per batch. This is a form of hybrid strategy and results show that the optimal allocation almost coincides with the pro-rata allocation over children in the di erent cities. Yarmand, Ivy, Denton, and Lloyd (2014) study a two-phase allocation problem with minimum required vaccination levels in each phase, where the required level for a region in the second phase only applies if the epidemic in that region is not yet contained after phase 1. They formulate a stochastic programming problem 5and show how the optimal allocation depends on the minimum required levels. Nguyen and Carlson (2016) compare di erent vaccination strategies which di er in when and how much vaccines become available. Deterministic and stochastic models are used and the optimal allocation for two coupled populations is determined numerically. All vaccines are assumed to be available at the same time. The authors present contour plots that indicate which combinations of the vaccination fraction and the timing of vaccination result in the same nal size. We extend this work by analytically describing the shape of these contour curves as well as by analyzing hybrid strategies where people can be vaccinated at multiple moments in time. Optimal vaccine dosage There are some studies on determining the optimal dose for vaccines against pandemic in uenza. Riley, Wu, and Leung (2007) show that a lower vaccine dose may be preferred, because it increases coverage levels. This strategy can be seen as a hybrid strategy which is advocated in the current paper. Similar results are found by Wood, McCaw, Becker, Nolan, and MacIntyre (2009), who nd that the lowest dose results in the smallest attack rate. Matrajt et al. (2015) compare the e ects of a one-dose and a two-dose strategy for in uenza vaccination and use a more analytical approach. The authors prove that there is a threshold in the level of protection that is obtained after the rst dose below which the two-dose strategy is the best. For pre-pandemic vaccination this threshold can analytically be characterized and for reactive vaccination numerical and simulation results are found. Our results contribute two this literature in two ways: we derive an analytical approach that also holds for the reactive case, but more importantly we propose hybrid strategies and show their bene ts. These hybrid strategies translate to some people receiving one dose and others receiving two doses. Riley et al. (2007) brie y mention the possibility to give health care workers a higher dosage than the remainder of the population, but this strategy is not analyzed. Model We now relate our modelling choices to current literature. We make use of the SIR model, which is a seminal model in epidemiology proposed by Kermack and McKendrick (1927). As our problem incorporates the e ect of timing of vaccination, we allow for vaccination during an outbreak (see also Chowell, Viboud, Wang, Bertozzi, & Miller, Fisman, Kwong, & Greer, 2010). Alternatively, there are studies that focus on pre-pandemic vaccination, assuming that all vaccines are available prior to the outbreak (e.g. Duijzer, Van Jaarsveld, Wallinga, & Dekker, 2016; Keeling & Shattock, 2012; Wu, Riley, & Leung, 2007). To evaluate the e ects of di erent vaccination strategies we focus on minimizing the nal size , i.e., the proportion of people infected during the outbreak (e.g., Keeling & Shattock, 2012; Lee, ericourt, 6& Sun, 2009; Wu et al., 2007). An alternative performance criterion is the reproduction ratio R, which is related to the initial growth of infections (Diekmann, Heesterbeek, & Britton, 2013). There are studies that focus on minimizing the reproduction ratio (Goldstein et al., 2009; Wallinga, van Boven, & Lipsitch, 2010) or on reaching a certain threshold value of the reproduction ratio (e.g., Gittings & Matson, 2016; Tanner, Sattenspiel, & Ntaimo, 2008). The reproduction ratio di ers from the nal size by focusing on the short term, whereas the nal size takes into account the entire time course of the epidemic. However, Duijzer et al. (2016) show that under certain conditions optimization problems involving these two performance criteria are equivalent. 3 Problem formulation We evaluate the e ects of di erent vaccination strategies and make use of the deterministic SIR model to model the time course of the epidemic. This model is explained in Section 3.1. In Section 3.2 we describe the e ect of vaccination on the epidemic and the considered decision problem. We formalize this in Section 3.3. In Section 3.4 we formulate the optimization problem that is studied in this paper. 3.1 The SIRmodel TheSIR model is a seminal model in epidemiology proposed by Kermack and McKendrick (1927). The population is divided into three compartments for which the time course is tracked (cf. Hethcote, 2000). Let s(t);i(t) andr(t) be the fractions of the population respectively susceptible, infected and removed at time t. In this paper we assume that the removed compartment consists of recovered individuals, deaths can be taken into account straightforwardly. By interpretation it must hold that s(t) +i(t) +r(t) = 1 for all t\u00150. TheSIR model is described by the following system of di erential equations, with the transmission rate and the rate of recovery denoted by and , respectively. ds dt=\u0000 si di dt= si\u0000 i dr =s0,i(0) =i0andr(0) =r0are given, with i0>0 and s0+i0+r0= 1. Figure 1 illustrates the time course for an epidemic that evolves according to the SIR model. This gure is made using the Runge-Kutta method (Kutta, 1901). The gure shows that not everybody gets infected during the outbreak. Around 50% of the population is still susceptible when the 7epidemic has died out, so they have escaped infection. We also observe in the gure that the infected individuals are initially increasing until they reach a certain peak value. After the peak, the epidemic starts to die out. From the di erential equations we can derive that this peak occurs when s(t) = . We therefore refer to an epidemic being controlled when s(t) is below the threshold . Although the number of infected people in a controlled epidemic can still be substantial, there are more recoveries than new infections per time unit so that the proportion of infected people is decreasing. Figure 1: Illustration of the deterministic SIR model with parameters = 0:25; = 0:35;i0= 10\u00006and s0= 1\u0000i0. 3.2 Problem description Vaccination reduces the fraction of susceptible individuals, in order to control the epidemic at an earlier point in time and to avoid or reduce an increase in the fraction of infected individuals. The e ect of vaccination is twofold. The people who directly bene t from vaccination are the vaccinees, because they acquire (partial) immunity due to vaccination. Indirectly also unvaccinated people bene t from the vaccination of others, as it reduces their disease exposure. This indirect e ect of vaccination is known as the herd e ect (Fine, 1993). Consider a decision maker who has a budget available to spend on the di erent vaccine types in the set J. These vaccine types di er in three aspects: the price per dose of vaccine ( pj), the e\u000ecacy of the vaccine ( j) and the time at which the vaccine becomes available ( j). The e\u000ecacy of a vaccine is the level at which the vaccine is able to induce immunity and can be interpreted as the proportion of vaccinated people that will get immune after vaccination. We assume that all vaccines can quickly be distributed as soon as they are available. Denote by Bthe total budget of the policy maker. Her goal is to divide this budget over the vaccine types in such a way that as few people as possible will get infected during the outbreak. 8The e ect of vaccination on the epidemic is illustrated in Figure 2. In this gure we consider a population of 106individuals where 150 000 people are vaccinated at time 10 with a vaccine that has e\u000ecacy 0.4 and another 100 000 people are vaccinated at time 100 with a vaccine that has e\u000ecacy 0.7. This means that e ectively 150 000 \u00020.4 + 100 000\u00020.7 = 130 000 people have become immune through vaccination. If we compare Figure 1 and Figure 2, we see that vaccination lowers the peak in infected individuals. Next to that, more people have escaped infection when vaccination is used: the proportion of people still susceptible when the epidemic has died out (i.e., the herd e ect) has increased from 50% to almost 60%. Figure 2: Illustration of vaccination in the deterministic SIR model with vaccination, with parameters as in Figure 1. In the remainder of this section we give a detailed model for the problem. 3.3 Vaccination To formally de ne vaccination, we introduce the following notation. Denote by Bjthe budget allocated to vaccines of type j. Furthermore, let 'j= j pjbe the e\u000ecacy per dollar for vaccines of type jwhich are available at j. The vaccines are administered to susceptible individuals and we assume that it is possible to identify the susceptible people. Thus the fraction of people no longer susceptible and immune due to allocatingBjto vaccines of type jequalsfj='jBj N, whereNis the size of the considered population. It makes sense to consider only Bj\u0014pjs( j)N: the amount of allocated budget is at most enough to vaccinate the entire susceptible population. Under this constraint fj\u0014s( j) j. ForBj>pjs( j)Nwe stipulate that fj=s( j) j. We also assume that vaccination takes no time, meaning that vaccination results in immunity immediately. 9We refer to Section 6 for a discussion of these assumptions. Under our assumptions vaccination causes a shift at time jfrom state ( s( j);i( j)) to state ( s( j)\u0000fj;i( j)). This implies that r( j) shifts tor( j)+fj. This is a common way of modelling vaccination (e.g., Bansal, Pourbohloul, & Lugn\u0013 er, & Wallinga, 2008). To compare di erent vaccination strategies we consider the state of the system when t!1 . This state is also referred to as `disease-free equilibrium', because lim t!1i(t) = 0 which can be derived from the di erential equations (1). For notational convenience, we de ne = ( 1;:::; n). Let G(f; ) denote the nal fraction of people susceptible in the disease-free equilibrium. More precisely, for fj2[0; js( ) = lim t!1s(t); (2) withs(t) evolving according to (1) in between two consecutive vaccination moments and after the last vaccination moment. We determine G(f; ) with an implicit relation called the nal size equation , details are in Appendix A. G(f; ) quanti es the so-called herd e ect , which is the indirect e ect of vaccination where unvaccinated people bene t from the vaccination of others. We refer to Duijzer, van Jaarsveld, Wallinga, and Dekker (2015) for a more extensive analysis of the herd e ect and the function G(f; ) for a single vaccination moment. In the remainder of this paper we focus on the nal size , i.e., the proportion of the population that has been infected during the outbreak. The nal size is denoted by Z(f; ) and j2Jfj+i0 (3) Observe that the part s0\u0000G(f; ) in above equation determines the proportion of people that were susceptible at the beginning of the outbreak, but are no longer susceptible at the end. These people have either become infected or have become immune because of vaccination. By correcting for those that are vaccinated (P j2Jfj), we remain with the number of infections during the outbreak. We add the initial infections ( i0) to determine the nal size of the outbreak. For a more detailed discussion of modelling vaccination in the SIR model we refer to Duijzer et al. (2015). 3.4 Optimization problem In this section we formally de ne our decision problem. Recall that we consider a decision maker with a total budget Bto spend on the vaccine types in Jin order to minimize the nal size of the outbreak. Using 10the notation that is introduced in Section 3.3 the optimization problem can be formulated as follows: minZ(f; ) s.t.NX j2Jfj 'j\u0014B fj\u001508j2J(4) The objective is to minimize the nal size. We formulate the optimization problem using the variables fj, but the constraints can easily be rewritten in terms of Bj. The rst constraint ensures that the budget Bis not exceeded. The second constraint makes sure that the amount of vaccines is non-negative. 4 Analytical results In this section we study Problem (4) and compare di erent vaccination strategies. In Section 4.1 we start with showing that a hybrid vaccination strategy can equivalently be summarized as a vaccination strategy with a single vaccination moment. The characterization of this single moment strategy enables us to analyze hybrid strategies in the following sections. In Section 4.2 we focus on comparing two vaccination strategies. We analyze pure strategies in which the entire budget is spent on one vaccine type, and we consider hybrid strategies where the budget is divided over the two vaccine types. Section 4.3 is dedicated to the analysis of two vaccine types that arrive in batches, such that vaccination does not take place at a single moment, but during a vaccination campaign. 4.1 Characterizing hybrid vaccination strategies Hybrid vaccination strategies are di\u000ecult to compare, because they di er both in the times at which people are vaccinated and in the proportion of the population vaccinated at those times. To simplify the comparison, we show how to construct for each hybrid strategy a single moment strategy, such that the hybrid strategy and the single moment strategy have the same nal size. Note that this single moment strategy di ers from the pure strategies described earlier, because the vaccination moment for the single moment strategy need not, and typically is not, one of the moments at which vaccination is possible for the hybrid strategy. The formal result is presented in the following theorem. The proof can be found in Appendix B. In this theorems(i)(t) ands(ii)(t) respectively denote the proportion of people susceptible at time tin the hybrid strategy (i) and the single moment strategy ( ii). 11Theorem 1. We consider an initial state denoted by (s0;i0)and use the SIR model to evaluate the epi- demic. A hybrid vaccination strategy (i)withnvaccination moments at times 1;:::; nand corresponding vaccination fractions f1;:::;fnresults in the same nal size as a single moment vaccination strategy (ii)with one vaccination moment at time Tand a vaccination fraction fT=Pn j=1fjif and only T2[ 1; n]satisfying (5). The interpretation of Theorem 1 is as follows. E ectively vaccinating a certain number of people divided overnmoments in the time interval [ 1; n] results in the same nal size as e ectively vaccinating this same number of people at once at some time T. Although the existence of Tmay be intuitive, its characterization in (5) is not trivial. The contribution of Theorem 1 is therefore that we characterize the single moment vaccination strategy: we describe the vaccination fraction and the time at which vaccination should take place. The condition (5) that characterizes s(ii)( T) has the following interpretation. Upon vaccination at time jin strategy ( i) the susceptible population reduces j)\u0011 . The time Tissuch that multiplying s(ii)( T) with the product of all these factors for j= 1;:::;n results in a reduction of fT. The characterization of Tallows us to compare di erent hybrid strategies with each other and with pure strategies. To compute the actual value for T, we numerically evaluate of the di erential equations in (1) to determine at which time the proportion of susceptible people equals s(ii)( T). In Appendix C we show that the result of Theorem 1 also holds for a more general epidemic model, namely the SInRmodel with nconsecutive infectious stages. The SInRmodel can also take into account a latent period or multiple levels of infectivity. Since the characterization of s( T) in Theorem 1 underlies the other results in this paper, we conjecture that these results also extend to this more general epidemic model. If this conjecture is true, our choice for the simple SIR model is not restrictive. 4.2 Comparison of vaccination strategies In this section we focus on comparing vaccination strategies for which two vaccine types can be used, i.e., jJj= 2. Consider a policy maker that has a certain budget available to spend on these two vaccine types. We start with considering strategies in which all budget is spent on one vaccine type (Section 4.2.1). We 12refer to these vaccination strategies as `pure strategies'. Next, we extend these results to hybrid strategies in which the budget may be divided over the two types (Section 4.2.2). 4.2.1 Pure strategies The two considered vaccine types are characterized by a vaccine e\u000ecacy and a time at which the vaccines become available, respectively denoted by 'jand jforj= 1;2. We refer to vaccine type 1 as the vaccine type which is available early, but has a low e\u000ecacy per dollar and to type 2 as the vaccine type which is available at a later point in time, but has a high e\u000ecacy per dollar. Hence, 1< 2and'1< ' 2. Let us assume that the characteristics are xed for vaccine type 1. We analyze the e ects of varying the availability and e\u000ecacy per dollar of type 2 to see which vaccine type is preferred. If the vaccines of type 2 are available very early, i.e., just after 1, hardly any new infections will occur in the interval [ 1; 2]. The higher e\u000ecacy per dollar of type 2 outweighs the delayed availability, because it allows to e ectively vaccinate more people and possibly even to control the epidemic directly at 2. On the other hand, if the vaccines of type 2 are available when the epidemic is already declining, they are of little use. In a declining epidemic the risk of becoming infected is low and you would almost only vaccinate people that would not have become infected anyways. Thus, when type 2 is available very late, we prefer type 1 vaccines because they are available in time to reduce the growth in infections and lower the risk of infection for unvaccinated people. We thus see that type 1 is preferred when type 2 is available very late, but also that type 2 is preferred if this type is available early. This implies that there is a speci c time for the availability of type 2 at which the two pure strategies are equally good. Theorem 2 derives a formal result along these lines and characterizes the curve where the pure strategies are equally good. In this theorem 2is implicitly de ned through s2( 2), withsj(t) denoting the proportion of people susceptible in strategy jat timet. Theorem 2. The pure strategies 1 and 2 result in the same nal size under the following condition: s2( than the right-hand side in above expression, then strategy 2 is worse (better). Recall that the proportion of people susceptible is decreasing over time, such that a lower s2( 2) implies a later availability (i.e., a higher 2). Thus, Theorem 2 con rms our nding that strategy 2 is worse if the vaccines of this type are available late, but better if they are available early. We can derive the following managerial implications from Theorem 2. First, we observe that if the two vaccine types have the same 13e\u000ecacy per dollar, the best vaccine is the one that is available at the earliest time. Secondly, if the two vaccine types are available at the same time such that s1( 1) =s2( 2), the vaccine with the highest e\u000ecacy per dollar results in the lowest nal size. In short, vaccinating early is better and vaccines with a higher e\u000ecacy per dollar are better. These conclusions also imply that later available vaccine types with a lower e\u000ecacy per dollar are always dominated by vaccine types that are available at an earlier time and have a higher e\u000ecacy. This con rms our choice to consider vaccine types for which 1< 2and'1<' 2. If the epidemic can be controlled with only vaccines of type 1, then there are not many new infections after 1andG(f1; 1) is only slightly smaller than\u0010 s1( 1)\u0000B'1 N\u0011 . By (6) in that case vaccines of type 2 can only be preferred if 2is very close to 1. In condition (6) the two parameters that characterize type 2 appear: the availability and the e\u000ecacy per dollar. For strategy 1 and 2 to be equally good, there is a trade-o between those two parameters. Delaying should be compensated by a higher e\u000ecacy per dollar. Though if the availability is too far delayed, there is no compensation possible. Corollary 3. The value for 2that satis es (6)is increasing in '2. We illustrate the switching curve for two vaccination strategies in Figure 3. We can compute 2easily from (6) by numerical evaluation of the di erential equations (1). The parameters for this gure are as follows:B=N = 0:5 and = 0:35; = 0:24. Both vaccines have a price of 1 dollar per dose. Vaccines of type 1 have e\u000ecacy per dollar '1= 0:4 and are available at time 0 when i0= 10\u00006ands0= 1\u0000i0. To construct the gure, we use (6) to determine the relation between s2( 2) and'2and we evaluate the di erential equations to derive 2froms2( 2). The gure shows the same structure as described before. We also see that vaccines which become available very late are never preferred, regardless of their e\u000ecacy per dollar. 4.2.2 Hybrid strategies In addition to the pure strategies that are analyzed in the previous section, we can also consider hybrid strategies. In hybrid strategies the budget is partly spent on vaccines of type 1 and partly on vaccines of type 2. Intuitively one might think that one of the vaccine types is better than the other, such that only a pure strategy can be optimal. However, in this section we prove and explain that the opposite is true. To investigate when hybrid strategies can be optimal, we take the e\u000ecacy per dollar of type 2 as xed and vary the time at which these vaccines become available. We start with 2high, such that it is best to spend the entire budget on vaccines of type 1. By advancing the availability of type 2, we will reach a point 140:30:40:50:60:70:80:9 1050100150200 '2<' 1 '2 2 Figure 3: Illustration of the switching curve. In the white area strategy 1 results in the lowest nal size and is therefore the best and in the dark area this holds for strategy 2. at which these vaccines are so attractive, that it is no longer optimal to spend the entire budget on vaccines of type 1. The following theorem shows under which condition this happens. To derive this condition, we make use of Theorem 1 which provides a useful characterization of the hybrid strategy. Theorem 4. Consider the pure strategy where all vaccines are of type 1. It is better to shift \u000fvaccines to type 2, with \u000f>0small, under the following wheres1( v 1)denotes the proportion of people susceptible just after vaccination at time 1. By spending some of the budget on vaccines of type 1 and some on vaccines of type 2, the population can bene t from the advantages of both vaccine types. The early vaccination with type 1 reduces the initial growth in infections and with the high e\u000ecacy per dollar of type 2 many people can achieve immunity due to vaccination. Such a hybrid strategy is only bene cial if the epidemic is still ongoing when the vaccines of type 2 become available and if the e\u000ecacy per dollar of type 2 is high enough. This can also be seen if we analyze the condition in Theorem 4. The term on the right-hand side represents the proportion of the total number of infections after 1that occurs while waiting for the vaccines of type 2, i.e., in the interval [ 1; 2]. This proportion is an indication of the additional infections experienced if the decision maker decides to wait for vaccines of type 2. It is bene cial to wait if the gain in e\u000ecacy per dollar, captured by the ratio'2 '1, outweighs the additional infections during this waiting time. 15If the vaccines of type 2 become available when the epidemic has almost died out, then almost all infections have already taken place in the interval [ 1; 2] and the higher e\u000ecacy per dollar of type 2 does not compensate for the late availability. On the other hand, if the epidemic is still ongoing and infections are increasing when type 2 becomes available, only a small part of the infections has already taken place while waiting for type 2 and it is worth waiting for this better vaccine. One could argue that if the decision maker should shift \u000fvaccines from type 1 to type 2, why not spend the entire budget on vaccines of type 2? There are two main reasons why this would not result in a good strategy. Firstly, the vaccines of type 2 are available at a later point in time. By using only these vaccines, the epidemic can spread freely until 2, which might cause a lot of infections. The second reason is related to the high e\u000ecacy per dollar of the vaccines of type 2 through which many people can be e ectively vaccinated. This seems to be advantageous, but it might also mean that the epidemic can easily be controlled with less vaccines. Spending the entire budget on vaccines of type 2 results in vaccinated people that would not have become infected in the rst place. These vaccines are not e ectively used and it is better to use part of the budget for reducing the initial growth by vaccinating some people at 1, such that the epidemic can be controlled at 2by spending the remaining budget on vaccines of type 2. The following two lemmas formally describe the relation between pure and hybrid strategies: Lemma 5. At the indi erence curve, when the two pure strategies are equally good, the hybrid strategy is strictly better and results in a lower nal size. Lemma 6. If the two pure strategies are equally good for vaccines of type 2 that become available at time T, then there exists a T\u0003>T such that it is optimal to shift \u000fvaccines to type 2 when the vaccines of type 2 become available at time T\u0003. The interpretation of Lemma 6 is that while advancing the availability of type 2, you will rst reach the point where it is optimal to shift a little bit of the budget to type 2 before you reach the switching curve. Thus, even if the pure strategy with only type 2 is worse than the pure strategy with only type 1, it can be bene cial to use vaccines of type 2 in a hybrid strategy. Lemma 5 con rms that the hybrid strategy is optimal around the switching curve. The structure described by these two lemmas is also illustrated in Figure 4, which is determined with enumeration. We observe that the solid switching curve lies in the dashed region where hybrid strategies are optimal. The parameters for this gure are the same as in Section 4.2.1. We observe the following in Figure 4. If pure strategy 1 is optimal for some 2, it is also optimal when the vaccines of type 2 are available even later. Delaying the availability of type 2 results in even more infections 160:30:40:50:60:70:80:9 1050100150200250300350400 '2<' 1 '2 2 Figure 4: This gure illustrates the optimal strategy. In the white area strategy 1 results in the lowest nal size and is therefore the best and in the dark area this holds for strategy 2. The dashed area between the two dashed lines is a sketch of the region in which a hybrid strategy is optimal. The solid curve represents the switching curve from Figure 3. while waiting for this type which are not outweighed by the gain in e\u000ecacy per dollar. Analogously, pure strategy 2 remains optimal if 2is reduced. The reduced waiting time results in less infections, so the gain in e\u000ecacy per dollar will surely compensate that. Next to that, if 2is smaller there are still more people susceptible when the vaccines of type 2 become available, such that more vaccines are needed to control the epidemic at 2. This implies that there is no incentive to reduce the vaccination fraction at 2by shifting some vaccines to type 1. We also see that by increasing '2we can move from a region where pure strategy 2 is optimal to a region where the hybrid strategy is optimal. For these higher values of '2, pure strategy 2 is no longer optimal, because the type 2 vaccines became so e\u000ecacious that spending the entire budget on these vaccines would lead to vaccinating people that would not have become infected in the rst place. Finally, the gure shows that the dashed area lies around the solid switching curve. Thus, the decision maker should consider spending the budget on both vaccine types when the two types are equally attractive. Clearly, if one vaccine type avoids much more infections than the other, this type should be used. But if the two types are comparable, our results show that it is suboptimal to arbitrarily choose one of the types. By dividing the budget and investing in both types, even more people can be saved from infection. As a nal part of this section, we analyze the e ects of an increasing budget in Figure 5. The gure shows that for small budgets, the optimal strategy is to order only the vaccines with the highest e\u000ecacy per dollar. 17Figure 5: Optimal division of the budget over the two vaccine types with the following characteristics: 1= 0,'1= 0:4, 2= 90 and'2= 0:7. In those cases the budget is insu\u000ecient to control the epidemic, so it is best to e ectively vaccinate as many people as possible. However, when the budget increases, it becomes bene cial to use a hybrid strategy. For a su\u000eciently large budget the epidemic can already be controlled at 1and the optimal strategy is to use only the vaccines of type 1. The results in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 are derived for a homogeneous population. In the discussion in Section 6 we discuss how our results are expected to carry over to heterogeneous populations, for example populations with multiple age-groups. 4.3 Two vaccination campaigns In this section we present one more result that follows from Theorem 1. This result is an extension of our results on pure strategies in Section 4.2.1. Instead of considering vaccines that are all allocated at once, we consider vaccines that are allocated in a vaccination campaign consisting of multiple vaccination moments. There are multiple reasons why a single vaccination moment might not be possible. Logistical considerations may play a role, which render it practically infeasible to allocate all vaccines at the same time (e.g., Rachaniotis, Dasaklis, & Pappis, 2012; Ramirez-Nafarrate, Lyon, Fowler, & Araz, 2015). Next to that, the production of vaccine is a complex process, amongst others characterized by random yields (cf., Adida, Dey, & Mamani, 2013; Eskandarzadeh, Eshghi, & Bahramgiri, 2016). Together with capacity constraints, this can result in production processes or technologies that produce vaccines in batches, such 18that the vaccines become available over time. In this section we extend some of our results to the case of vaccination campaigns. Let us consider two vaccination campaigns which di er in the e\u000ecacy per dollar of the used vaccine and in the time at which the campaign starts. These di erences are for example attributed to di erent production technologies. Denote by 'iand irespectively the e\u000ecacy per dollar of the vaccine and time at which the campaign starts for i= 1;2. Assume that during the vaccination campaign a total budget ofBis spent over nvaccination moments, such that B=n dollar is spent each time. The time in between two vaccination moments is Tfor both campaigns, which implies that the j-th vaccination moment takes place at time i+ (j\u00001)Tfor campaign i. Letsi jdenote the proportion of susceptible people at the j-th vaccination moment in the campaign i. The two vaccination campaigns result in the same nal size if the following condition is satis ed, where G('1; 1) denotes the herd e ect (8) If the left-hand side is positive (negative), strategy 1 is better (worse). The derivation of this condition can be found in Appendix D.3 and makes use of Theorem 1. Note that condition 8 implicitly de nes the relation between 2and'2, ass2 jfor alljdepend on 2. We can compute this relation through numerical analysis. Figure 6 illustrates the relation for the parameters '1= 0:5, 1= 0n= 4,T= 30 andB= 0:2N. As expected, we see that campaign 2 is better than campaign 1 if either campaign 2 does not start too late, or if the corresponding vaccines have a high e\u000ecacy. Again, we see that for 2above a certain threshold, around 80 in this case, vaccines of campaign 2 are too late to be optimal. Since a campaign with multiple moments is already some kind of hybrid strategy in itself, we do not consider partially investing in two campaigns. If a vaccination campaign is used instead of instantaneous mass vaccination, then preferences for the vaccine types can change. For example, the advantage of an early aspeci c vaccine type might disappear if it is distributed through a lengthy vaccination campaign. 5 Numerical experiments In this section we perform some numerical experiments. Our analytical results in Section 4 show theoretically that hybrid strategies can outperform pure strategies for two vaccine types. The objective of our numerical experiments in this section is twofold: rstly, we want to know how many infections can actually be saved by using a hybrid strategy and secondly we investigate whether it is bene cial to use a hybrid strategy with 19Figure 6: The switching curve for the two vaccination campaigns. In the white area campaign 1 is optimal and in the dark area campaign 2. The initial state and disease parameters are the same as in Figure 3. more than two vaccine types. We use data on an in uenza outbreak and in uenza vaccines from Matrajt et al. (2015). The parameters for the outbreak are as follows: N= 106;i0= 10\u00006;s0= 1\u0000i0; = 0:35 and = 0:25. They do not consider prices of the vaccines and assume that there are enough vaccines to vaccinate half of the population. In terms of our model we let the price be pdollar per dose of vaccine for all vaccine types and use a budget of B=pN=2. Matrajt et al. (2015) study vaccines that have an e ect on susceptibility, infectiousness and on the symptoms in case of infection. In our paper we only consider the e ect on susceptibility. Matrajt et al. (2015) study vaccines that become available 0, 45, 60, 75 or 90 days after the start of the outbreak and that have an e\u000ecacy in the range of 0.4-0.66. Likewise, we analyze the following seven vaccine types, assuming thatp= 1: Type 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 j 0 45 60 60 75 75 90 'j 0:4 three vaccine types in which no vaccine type(s) is/are dominated by others. This means that we do not consider those subsets which include two vaccine types that have the same time at which the vaccines become available or the same e\u000ecacy per dollar. For example, if a decision maker has to choose between vaccines of type 4 and 5, she will always prefer the vaccines of type 4 because they are available earlier and have the same e\u000ecacy per dollar. Analogously, type 6 will always be preferred if one has to choose between type 5 and 6, because both vaccine types are available at the same time, but type 6 has a higher e\u000ecacy per dollar. Taking these considerations into account, we nd 14 subsets consisting of three vaccine types each. For these subsets we analyze the best pure strategy, the best hybrid strategy 20with at most 2 types and the best hybrid strategy with at most 3 types. Note that the pure strategies are also included in the hybrid strategies. For the hybrid strategies we use enumeration and a stepsize of 1000 = 10\u00003Nvaccines. The results are reported in Table 1. In this table the nal size for the pure strategies is reported as a population fraction. For the hybrid strategies the relative performance compared to the best pure strategy is presented. Recall that our goal is to minimize the nal size. Hence, if the reported value in the table is below 100, it means that the hybrid strategy is better and results in a lower nal size than the pure strategy.

In brackets the optimal allocation over the three considered types with a step size 103doses of vaccine.\u0003the allocations for hybrid strategies with a most two and at most three vaccine types are the same. We start with discussing the column on hybrid strategies with at most two vaccine types in Table 1. The results show that in most cases a hybrid strategy is preferred. We see that the hybrid strategy often combines the earliest available vaccine with the vaccine that has the highest e\u000ecacy per dose. By using a hybrid strategy the nal size can be reduced with even more than 60% for vaccine types 1,2,7 and 1,3,7. 21Only for a few vaccine type combinations the nal size of the best hybrid strategy is the same as the nal size of the best pure strategy, which implies that the pure strategy is optimal in those cases. We conclude from Table 1 that using a hybrid strategy can result in a substantially lower nal size and is therefore worth investigating. The second goal of this section is to investigate hybrid strategies with more than two vaccine types. Interestingly, if we analyze Table 1 and compare hybrid strategies with at most two types with hybrid strategies with at most three vaccine types, the nal sizes are the same for all subsets of vaccine types. The additional freedom that is introduced by allowing to divide the budget over three vaccine types does not result in further reductions of the nal size. Additional experiments not reported here have also supported the conclusion that hybrid strategies with more than two vaccine types typically give no or very little additional bene ts In this section we do not analyze hybrid strategies with more than three vaccine types. Nevertheless we can draw conclusions for those situations. Consider a hybrid vaccination strategy with nvaccine types. By applying Theorem 1 to types 3, ..., nand summarizing them in one moment, the strategy with nvaccine types is equivalent to a vaccination strategy with three vaccine types. In our numerical results we do not nd situations where a hybrid vaccination strategy with three vaccine types is better than a hybrid strategy with at most two vaccine types. It is therefore unlikely that hybrid strategies with more than three vaccine types are optimal. Hence, we can conclude this section as follows. Consider a decision maker that can choose between multiple vaccines types. Based on our results decision makers can expect signi cant bene ts by considering hybrid strategies with two types of vaccine. However, hybrid strategies that invest in more than two vaccine types are expected to provide little to no additional bene t and the decision maker does not have to investigate those hybrid strategies. 6 Discussion In this section we discuss modelling assumptions, the generality of our results and possible directions for future research. The results in this paper are established under some assumptions. We model vaccination as an immediate transition of people from the susceptible compartment to the removed compartment. This assumption could be relaxed to studying the case where vaccination takes more time, which can be modelled as a vaccination campaign (cf., Section 4.3). In our analysis we assume that the vaccine e\u000ecacy is known for every vaccine 22type. Further research is needed to extend the analysis to environments where e\u000ecacy is uncertain, e.g., situations where the delayed availability is caused by a vaccine development phase with unknown outcome. Furthermore, we base our analysis on the SIR model, but show in Appendix C how some results extend to the more general SInRmodel. In the SIR model we consider a homogeneous population. Alternatively, a model for a heterogeneous population could be used, for example a population that is subdivided in multiple age- groups (e.g., Medlock, Meyers, & Galvani, 2009; Teytelman & Larson, 2012). In a heterogeneous population the nal size is the result of an optimization problem that is used to determine which allocation over the age-groups is best. We conjecture that a switching curve result similar to Theorem 2 can be derived in the case of a heterogeneous population, i.e., that there exists a curve separating the region where a pure type 1 strategy is optimal from the region where a pure type 2 strategy is optimal. Making the vaccines of type 2 more attractive by increasing their e\u000ecacy, reducing their price or by advancing their availability will reduce the nal size, as the original allocation is still feasible. Another interesting research direction is incorporating high-risk and high-transmission groups (e.g., Lee et al., 2015; Samii, Pibernik, Yadav, & Vereecke, 2012). 7 Conclusions In this paper we study the trade-o between the timing of vaccination and the e ectiveness of the response. This trade-o plays a role in several vaccination problems of which three examples are discussed in the introduction. We focus on a problem with an early aspeci c vaccine and a late speci c vaccine. We derive an analytical expression for the switching curve separating the region where the early aspeci c vaccine is preferred from the region where the late speci c vaccine is preferred. We demonstrate that it is not always optimal to spend the entire budget on one of the two vaccine types, but that a hybrid strategy can reduce the nal size with more than 50%. The derived insights are useful for decision makers. We show the importance of the trade-o between timing and e\u000ecacy and the e ects on controlling the epidemic. Early vaccination is able to reduce the initial increase in infections, but a vaccine with a higher e\u000ecacy per dollar can achieve higher immunity levels in the population such that the epidemic can be controlled quickly. When the epidemic can already be controlled with the early aspeci c vaccine, the decision maker should use only this vaccine. But when this is not possible, either only the speci c later vaccine should be used or a hybrid strategy should be considered. By applying a hybrid strategy the target population bene ts from both a quick response and a e\u000ecacious vaccine. Such a solution can also be helpful for decision makers who balance between the public pressure to respond quickly and the aim to spend the budget on the best possible vaccine. 23Extant literature mentions some practical considerations for using hybrid strategies. E.g., starting pro- duction earlier for some in uenza strains allows to have su\u000ecient time to produce vaccines against these strains while buying time to learn more about the other strains and allowing higher vaccine dosages for health care workers protects them from getting infected by patients. In this paper we give an important motivation for hybrid strategies even in the absence of such practical considerations. We show that a hy- brid strategy may in many cases make more e\u000ecient use of resources than any pure strategy, due to the non-linear dynamics of an epidemic. This paper thus provides an additional and more generally applicable motivation for the use of hybrid strategies which supersedes the practical arguments used in literature or in the US national pandemic response plan. Our results encourage to study hybrid vaccination strategies in any application where the trade-o between timing and e\u000ecacy plays a role, even if a direct practical necessity is missing.

In Section 3.3 we show that the herd e ect, denoted by the function G(f; ), is an important determinant in the nal size. The herd e ect is de ned as the nal fraction of people susceptible after a vaccination strategy characterized by vaccination fractions fand times . More precisely, for fj2[0;'jsj( )] G(f; ) = lim t!1s(t); (9) withs(t) evolving according to (1) for t > n. In this appendix we present and analyze an alternative formulation of the herd e ect, which forms the basis of the structural analysis of the herd e ect. Based on the di erential equations of the SIR model we derive an implicit expression for the herd e ect. From (1) the following equation follows, which presents the relation between i(t) ands(t) at characterizes the state of the system at any point in time, but prior to vaccination. In Theorem 1 we show that for any vaccination strategy with multiple vaccination moments, there is a single- moment strategy resulting in the same nal size. In this single-moment strategy a fraction fTof the population is vaccinated at time T. In the remainder of this section we will use the parameters of the single-moment vaccination strategy to analyze G(f; ). Upon vaccination at time Tthe state of the system changes from state ( s( T);i( T)) to state ( s( T)\u0000 fT;i( T)). Hence, the state ( s( T)\u0000fT;i( T)) directly after vaccination can be seen as a new initial state, wherei( T) can be obtained from (10). Since lim t!1i(t) = 0, the function G(f; ) can be derived from (10) by settingi(t) = 0 and thus is the unique i0>0. Denote by Z(f; ) the nal size according to Rewriting (11) the following: G(f; ) =s0\u0012 1\u0000fT s( T)\u0013 expf\u0000\u001bZ(f; )g that (11) and (12) are implicit de nitions of the herd e ect. Alternatively, we can derive a de nition based on the Lambert W function (Corless, Gonnet, Hare, Je rey, & Knuth, 1996; Ma & Earn, 2006). This de nition can be used to calculate the herd An early response is always better than a later response, as shown in the following lemma: Lemma A.1. For xedfT, the herd e ect G(f; )is increasing in s( T)and the nals size Z(f; )is decreasing in s( T). Proof. See Section 4.5 of Duijzer et al. (2015). Appendix B Multiple vaccination moments In this Appendix we prove Theorem 1. Thereto we rst present two supporting results: a result on the dynamics of an epidemic in Lemma B.1 and a technical result in Lemma B.2. Recall that we have nmoments of vaccination, respectively at time 1; 2;:::; n. The vaccination fractions at these moments are denoted by f1;:::;fnands( j) denotes the fraction of susceptible people just prior to vaccination at time jforj= 1;:::;n . For notional convenience we add two vaccination moments at 0= 0 and n+1= +1at which no vaccination takes place, such that f0=fn+1= 0. The following theorem shows that in between two vaccination moments this system follows the time course of a system without vaccination and with a di erent initial state. Lemma B.1. For allk= 1;:::;n we consider the following two systems, that both follow the dynamics of theSIR model. Note that (i) is a system with vaccination and (ii) a system without vaccination: (i) let (s(t);i(t))denote the state at time tof the system with initial state (s(0);i(0)) = (s0;i0)when a fractionfjof the susceptible people is vaccinated at time jforj= 1;:::;k . (ii) letsk(t)andik(t)denote the state at time tof a system without vaccination and with initial of system (i) on the interval t2( k; k+1)is the same as the time course of system (ii) on the shifted interval [t\u0003 k;t\u0003 k+ theorem will be proven by induction. We start with proving that it holds for k= 1. Consider system (i) and note that the relation between i( 1) ands( 1) just prior to vaccination at time 1can be described by (10) as follows: i( 1) =\u0000s( 1) +log(s( 1)) \u001b+s0+i0\u0000log(s0) \u001b(14) On the interval t2[ 1; 2) we can see system (i) as a system that starts at time 1with initial state [(s( 1)\u0000f1);i( 1)]. We can use (10) again to In the second line of above derivation we substitute s( 1) andi( 1) from (14) and in the third line we take the exponent. We can verify with (10) that the states ( s(t);i(t)) fort2[ 1; 2) that satisfy (15) are also part of the time course of system (ii) for k= 1 by substituting in (10) the following initial state for system at which system (ii) is in the state ( s( 1)\u0000f1;i( 1)). Such time t\u0003 1must exist, because the state ( s( 1)\u0000f1;i( 1)) is part of the time course of system (ii). Then the time course of system (i) on the interval ( 1; 2) is equivalent to that of system (ii) on the interval ( t\u0003 1;t\u0003 1+ 2\u0000 1). This completes the base case of the proof by induction. We perform the inductive step and assume that the theorem holds for k. In that case we can determine the state of systems (i) and (ii) at time k+1with (10) as follows, using that sk 0+ik prove that above relation implies that the theorem also holds for k+ 1. Thereto, we analyse system (i) for t2( k+1; k+2). We make use of (10) and take the state at time k+1just after vaccination, (s( k+1\u0000fk+1;i( k+1)), as the initial state. Then the following holds use (16) to substitute s( k+1) andi( k+1). We can again verify with (10) that the states (s(t);i(t)) fort2( k+1; k+2) that satisfy (17) are part of the time course of system (ii) for k+ 1, as before for the case k= 1. Lett\u0003 k+1denote the time at which system (ii) is in the state ( s( k+1)\u0000fk+1;i( k+1)), then the time course of system (i) on the interval ( k+1; k+2) is equivalent to that of system (ii) on the interval (t\u0003 k+1;t\u0003 k+1+ k+2\u0000 k+1). This completes the proof of this theorem. Lemma B.2. The following relation holds for all n\u00151, where we de neQj\u00001 n= 1 : 1\u0000(1\u0000x1) holds initial state denoted by (s0;i0)and use the SIR model to evaluate the epi- demic. A hybrid vaccination strategy (i)withnvaccination moments at times 1;:::; nand corresponding vaccination fractions f1;:::;fnresults in the same nal size as a single moment vaccination strategy (ii)with one vaccination moment at time Tand a vaccination fraction fT=Pn j=1fjif and only one T2[ 1; n]satisfying (5). Proof. Note that strategy (i) and (ii) allocate in total the same amount of vaccines, because fT=Pn j=1fj. Hence, to show that the nal sizes for both strategies are the same, it su\u000eces to show that both strategies result in the same herd e ect, i.e. lim t!+1s(t) is equal for these two systems. Denote by s1(1) ands2(1) the nal fraction of people susceptible in system (i) and (ii) respectively. Note that for t!+1the fraction of infected individuals goes to zero. From Lemma B.1 and the fact that 28i1(1) = 0 we derive that s1(1) follows from In case of a single vaccination moment we can use the nal line of i)\u0011 it holds that (18) and (19) are equal to each other, which implies that s1(1) =s2(1). With the equal herd e ects and the same amount of e ectively allocated vaccines, the nal sizes of the two strategies are equal. It remains to show that T2[ 1; n]. We prove this in the following two steps: (i) we show that s1( n)<s( T)<s( 1) and (ii) we show that (i) Observe that s1( that s( T)<s1( 1). Analogously, we can prove that s( s1( n)<s( T)<s1( 1). (ii) Given that s(t) is decreasing over time, s( T)< s 1( 1) implies that T> 1. Furthermore, by Lemma B.1 strategies (i) and (ii) are equivalent for time t > n. This implies that T< nand hence, T2[ 1; n] This completes this theorem. Appendix C Generality of Theorem 1 One of the extensions to the standard SIR compartmental model, is the SInRmodel with ndi erent consecutive infectious stages. Let s(t) andr(t) denote the fraction of people respectively susceptible and 29removed at time t. The fractions of people infected in every state are given by ik(t) fork= 1;:::;n . Interpretation dictates that s(t) 1 for all t. Let kand kdenote respectively the transmission rate and recovery rate in infectious stage k. The di erential equations (1999) prove that R0=Pn k=1 k kfor this model, with R0denoting the basic reproduction ratio. In (10) we present a relation between s(t) andi(t). A similar relation can be derived for the SInRmodel (Appendix C (21) we can derive that the result of Theorem 1 also holds for the SInRmodel. The proof is identical, we only need to use an adjusted version of Lemma B.1. Next, we show how the result of this latter theorem carries over to the more general SInRepidemic model. Lemma C.1. For allk= 1;:::;m we consider the following two systems, that both follow the dynamics of theSInRmodel. Note that (i) is a system with vaccination and (ii) a system without vaccination: (i) let (s(t);i1(t);:::;in(t))fort2( k; k+1)denote the state at time tof the system with (s(0);i1(0);:::;in(0)) as initial state for which a fraction fjof the susceptible people is vaccinated at time jforj= 1;:::;k . (ii) let (sk(t);ik 1(t);:::;ik (i) on the interval t2( k; k+1)is the same as time course of system (ii) on the shifted interval [t\u0003;t\u0003+ The proof is analogous to the proof of Theorem 1, now only using the relation between s(t) and i1(t);:::;in(t) from (21) instead of the relation for the SIR model (10). 30Appendix D Analytical results D.1 Pure strategies In this section we derive the switching curve which is presented in Theorem 2. To prove this theorem, we propose a function that can be used to compare the two pure vaccination strategies. In the supporting result of Lemma D.1 we show how this function can be used to determine which strategy is best, i.e., which strategy results in the lowest nal size. We de ne this function H(f1;f2;s1;s2) the herd e ect for strategy 1. The following result can be derived: Lemma D.1. The sign of the function H(f1;f2;s1;s2)determines which strategy is best: if the function value equals zero, the two strategies are equally good and if the function value is positive (negative) strategy 1 is better (worse). Proof. We prove this theorem in the following three steps: (i) Strategy 1 and 2 are equally good if and only if H(f1;f2;s1;s2) = 0, (ii) Strategy 1 is better than strategy 2 if and only if H(f1;f2;s1;s2)>0, (iii) Strategy 2 is better than strategy 1 if and only if H(f1;f2;s1;s2)<0. The proof is as follows: (i) Z(f1; 1)\u0000Z(f2; 2) = 0 ,G(f1; (3) ,s0\u0012f2 s2\u0000f1 expf\u0000\u001bZ(f1; = 0 substitute (12) (ii) Observe that the condition H(f1;f2;s1;s2) = 0 can equivalently be formulated 1) + (s1\u0000f1)(f2\u0000f1) that the nal size Z(f; ) is monotonically decreasing in s( ). Hence, if s2is slightly lower than the expression above, then Z(f2; 2)>Z(f1; 1). s2<s1f2G(f1; 1) f1G(f1; 1) + (s1\u0000f1)(f2\u0000f1),H(f1;f2;s1;s2)>0 (iii) Analogous to (ii). Theorem 2. The pure strategies 1 and 2 result in the same nal size under the following condition: s2( than the right-hand side in above expression, then strategy 2 is worse (better). Proof. The results follows directly from Lemma D.1. Corollary 3. The value for 2that satis es (6)is increasing in '2. Proof. We proof this result by taking the derivative of the switching curve (6) with respect to '2: s1( 1)\u0000V'1 N\u0011 which means that the nal fraction of people susceptible is smaller than the fraction of people susceptible just after vaccination. This holds, because the proportion of people susceptible is decreasing over time. Hence, s2( 2) is decreasing in '2. By the same argument this means that the value for 2that satis es (6) is increasing in '2. This completes the proof. D.2 The hybrid strategy In this section we analyze the hybrid strategy that consists of an early aspeci c vaccine and a late speci c vaccine. We respectively denote by strategy 1 and 2 the two pure strategies for the considered vaccine types. We start this section with Theorem 4 in which we derive under which condition the hybrid strategy outperforms strategy 1. We know that strategy 1 and 2 are equally good at the switching curve. Hence, if the condition derived in Theorem 4 holds at the switching curve, then the hybrid strategy is better than both pure strategies at the switching curve. We show in Lemma 5 that this is indeed the case. Before we prove this lemma, we rst present two auxiliary results on the dynamics of the SIR model in Lemma D.2 and Lemma D.3. 32In this section we use the following notation: strategy 3 denotes the hybrid strategy with V1vaccines of type 1 and V\u0000V1vaccines of type 2, with V12(0;V). In Table 2 we summarize the three strategies, and formulate the hybrid strategy in terms of a pure strategy by applying Theorem 1. We denote by si(t) the proportion of people susceptible at time tin strategy i= 1;2;3. Strategy fat This table describes the three vaccination strategies. The last two columns with fi;sicharacterize the vaccination strategy by Theorem 1 with only one vaccination moment and the same nal size. Theorem 4. Consider the pure strategy where all vaccines are of type 1. It is better to shift \u000fvaccines to type 2, with \u000f>0small, under the following wheres1( v 1)denotes the proportion of people susceptible just after vaccination at time 1. Proof. In this proof we compare strategy 1 and strategy 3 of Table 2. These strategies are identical, and therefore equally good, in case V1=V. By Lemma D.1 the following condition holds if evaluate the derivative of H(f1;f3;s1;s3) with respect to V1at the point V1=V. If this derivative is positive, then decreasing V1results in a decrease of H(f1;f3;s1;s3), rendering it negative and implying that 9\u000f>0 such that strategy 3 with V1=V\u0000\u000fis better than strategy 1 by Lemma D.1. We now investigate this derivative with respect to V1. Note that V1only plays a role in strategy 3, such 33thats1;f1andG1(f1; 1) are not a ected by changes in V1. We use @V1H(f1;f3;s1;s3)jV1=V>0 by substituting V1=Vin above expression. ForV1=Vstrategy 1 and 3 are identical, which implies that s3( 2) =s1( denote proportion of people susceptible directly after vaccination, i.e., s1( v 1) =\u0010 s1\u0000V'1 N\u0011 . We substitute Lemma D.2. Consider two systems sj(t)andij(t)forj= 1;2and assume that they both follow the dynamics of the deterministic SIR model. Ifs1(0) = (1\u0000f1)s2(0)andi1(0) =i2(0), thens1(t)>(1\u0000f1)s2(t)for all t>0. Proof. We proof this lemma \u000fAt time it ands1(0) = (1\u0000f1)s2(0). \u000fAs long \u000fWhens1(t)\u0015s2(t) ands2(t) intersect at most This proves the lemma for all t>0. It su\u000eces to prove the claim in the second bullet point. We start with s1(0) = (1\u0000f)s2(0) as long as s1(t)< s 2(t) we also have that i1(t)<i2(t). We prove the lemma by induction, using the following inductive step: if s1(t)\u0015(1\u0000f1)s2(t) and i1(t)<i2(t), thens1(t+\u000f)>(1\u0000f1)s2(t+\u000f). We prove inductive step are satis ed at t=\u000f, the proof of the lemma is completed. Lemma D.3. two di (sj 0;ij 0)forj= 1;2and assume that sj(t)andij(t)follow the dynamics of the deterministic SIR model. Then s1(t) =s2(t)for at most one t2[0;1). i.e., the curves for the proportion of people susceptible intersect at most once. Proof. De ne the function H(x) =\u0000x+1 \u001blog(x). Then the following can be derived from (10): i(t) =H(s(t)) +i0\u0000H(s0) When the curves for the proportion of people susceptible intersect, it holds Observe that the right-hand side of above equation is a constant that only depends on the initial state. When two curves intersect, the derivative of the one must be larger than the other. Using the di erential equations t=t1>0,i1(t1)\u0000i2(t1)>0 35If condition is satis ed, the constant at the right-hand side of (22) must be positive. Now consider the intersection at t2, where we need the following: @ @ts2(t) t=t2\u0000@ @ts1(t) t=t2<0,i1(t2)\u0000i2(t2)<0 This condition can only be satis ed if the right-hand side of (22) is negative. Since this right-hand side is a constant, it cannot be positive and negative at the same time. Hence, it is not possible to have two intersections. We arrive at a contradiction and conclude that the curves s1(t) ands2(t) can intersect at most once, which completes the proof of this lemma. Lemma 5. At the indi erence curve, when the two pure strategies are equally good, the hybrid strategy is strictly better and results in a lower nal size. Proof. The outline of the proof is as follows: \u000fWe use Lemma D.1 to nd an expression for G(f1; 1) making use of the fact that the two pure strategies, strategy 1 and 2, are equally good. \u000fThis expression for G(f1; 1) is substituted in the condition of Theorem 4 and we show that the resulting expression is positive. By Lemma D.1 the following condition holds if strategy 1 and 2 are equally We insert above expression for G(f1; 1) the second to last condition of Theorem 4 to show that the hybrid strategy we substitute the expression for G(f1; 1). To show that above condition holds, we apply Lemma D.2 and note that until 1the two epidemics follow the same time course. Hence, the hybrid strategy withV1=V\u0000\u000fis better than the pure strategies. This completes the proof of this theorem. Lemma 6. If the two pure strategies are equally good for vaccines of type 2 that become available at time T, then there exists a T\u0003>T such that it is optimal to shift \u000fvaccines to type 2 when the vaccines of type 2 become available at time T\u0003. Proof. Observe that TandT\u0003are respectively characterized by (6) and (7). In both expressions the time is implicitly characterized via s2(T) ors1(T\u0003). In condition (7) we used the following notation s1( v 1) is the proportion of people susceptible just after vaccination at time 1. i.e.,s1( v 1) =\u0010 s1( v)\u0000V'1 N\u0011 . Substituting this equation is derived from (6). Note that s1( v 1) =s1( that s1(T)>s2(T)\u0010 1\u0000V'1 Ns1( 1)\u0011 . Since the proportion of people susceptible is decreasing over time, this implies that T <T\u0003, which completes the proof. D.3 Two vaccination campaigns In Section 4.3 we describe two technologies that can be used for the production of vaccines for a vaccination campaign. The resulting vaccination campaigns have each nvaccination moments. To analyze the campaigns and the corresponding nal sizes, we apply the result of Lemma B.1. Using the notation of that theorem, we have that fT i='iB Nand fori= 1;2. We make use of expression (6) to derive the switching curve that compares two single-moment vaccination strategies. We use that fi j='jB the second step, we substitute the expression for s2( T 2). The derivation above leads to condition (8), which is presented in Section 4.3. 37References Adida, E., Dey, D., & Mamani, H. (2013). Operational issues and network e ects in vaccine markets.
