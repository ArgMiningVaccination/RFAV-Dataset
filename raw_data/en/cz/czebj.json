I don't travel much now and I feel lucky that I have found Dr Janet to take care of me when I've done something to pull my back out. She is that most dedicated chiropractic professional I have ever met. If she can't fix you , it won't be for lack of trying - 2/2/2019 Over the past 25 years I have had a slew of Chiropractors work on my back. Dr Janet has the greatest touch, as she does a blend of Chiropractic and deep tissue massage, and takes her time getting stuff in to the right places. Thumbs way up ! - 1/12/2016 I have known Dr. Janet Cirrone for over twenty years. My family goes to her as well. She is a true professional. She has helped me so many times over the years with my back. She has put me back in business to be able move and bend and live my life. She is also a kind wonderful compassionate person. An asset to our community. - 6/3/2014First to Review I have had ongoing neck and back pain 7+ years with chronic headaches and a chronic gnawing pain in my shoulder blade. I've tried it all--acupuncture, physical therapy, yoga, spinal injections, pain medication, prolotherapy--none ever greatly helped my pain. I started seeing Dr. Cirrone in May after finding her on Yelp, and after 2 visits, the constant pain in my shoulder blade has disappeared! I have never felt better! She also was able to have my past MRI and x-Ray reports faxed to her office and explained their results to me better than any doctor ever has! It's not all about adjusting, Dr. Cirrone incorporates massage, and postural teaching into each visit.
