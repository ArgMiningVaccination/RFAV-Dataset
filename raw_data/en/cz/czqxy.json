On April 20, 1973, Nevada governor Mike O'Callaghan signed into law Senate Bill 448, also known as the Chinese Medicine Act, making Nevada the first state in the United States to recognize traditional Chinese medicine (including acupuncture) as a learned profession and to allow for the practice of acupuncture by non-physician licensed acupuncturists. Journal of Integrative Medicine 2015 The early history of acupuncture in USA during 1969-1979 Journal of integrative medicine 2016 A variety of primary sources show that while acupuncture has been practiced in South Carolina by non-physicians only since the 1970s, its full history in the state begins much earlier. The historical evidence makes clear that acupuncture was once an established and highly respected therapy used by medical doctors across South Carolina to treat a wide range of patient ailments. An analysis of sources such as case studies and essays published in nineteenth-century medical journals along with medical school syllabi, lecture notes, doctoral dissertations, and other materials reveals that prior to the Civil War, several South Carolinian physicians knew of and utilized acupuncture in their practices, and faculty at the state's first medical college taught acupuncture techniques to students. Combined, these items illustrate a rich, complex history regarding the early uses of acupuncture in the United States\u2014the beginnings of a healing practice that have gone largely unnoticed in the historical literature and merit further scholarly attention. PLOS ONE Acupuncture has been practiced in the United States more or less continuously since the early nineteenth century. Evidence strongly suggests that American physicians were the first health care professionals to practice acupuncture in the U.S. Although most physicians who used acupuncture lived in New York and Philadelphia, the procedure quickly spread to the South and Midwest as well, with some physicians using related therapies such as moxa. Physicians employed acupuncture for a wide range of ailments, including rheumatism, neuralgia, and various types of musculoskeletal pain, and reported various degrees of success among diverse groups of patients. By the late 1850s, however, the use of acupuncture had declined considerably, due largely to concerns about the pain it caused and an inability to explain how and why acupuncture worked. Despite these concerns, some American physicians continued to utilize acupuncture in practice, and to recommend it for certain conditions. While many people credit James Reston's 1971 account in the New York Times with the introduction of acupuncture to the United States, it actually has been used continuously in this country for nearly two centuries. One of the first practitioners of acupuncture was Franklin Bache, a Philadelphia physician. In 1825, Bache performed the first rudimentary trials of acupuncture on American soil, treating more than a dozen prisoners suffering from chronic pain, neuralgia, rheumatism, and other disorders. The results of his work were published in a prestigious medical journal the following year, making Bache one of the first, if not the first, American to document his experiences using acupuncture on a clinical basis. 2017 Many complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions, such as acupuncture and herbal medicines, are rooted in traditional medicine (TM) systems indigenous to particular cultures and lands. The World Health Organization has recommended that nations take steps to regulate both TM and CAM practitioners worldwide, with the aim of enhancing their 'safety, quality and effectiveness'. Several United Nations bodies have moreover recommended that nations take steps to protect TM knowledge, and prevent further misappropriation of TM practices. However, to date, very few studies have investigated or discussed how regulators may address the unique complexities of regulating TM practitioners and TM-rooted practices. This PhD dissertation - a qualitative case study of traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture regulation in the province of Ontario, Canada: a) explores the range of factors that distinguish the regulation of traditional medicine practices and professionals from biomedi... Annals of Internal Medicine 2002 Asian Medicine 2021 Tolbert Small (b. 1943) is a physician and civil rights activist best known for his advocacy for research on sickle cell anemia. In the summer of 2020 two of Asian Medicine's editors, Daniel Burton-Rose and Yi-Li Wu, interviewed Small about his clinical career of more than fifty years. The interview focuses on Small's experience with acupuncture, the practice of Chinese medicine in the United States, and his commitment to social justice. Small was introduced to acupuncture in 1972 as a member of a delegation of the Black Panther Party to the People's Republic of China, and he incorporated it into his clinical practice upon his return to Oakland, California. Small began practicing acupuncture at a time when instructional materials and therapeutic implements were difficult to obtain. He witnessed the gradual mainstreaming of Chinese medicine in the United States, accompanied by problems of differential access based on race and income.
