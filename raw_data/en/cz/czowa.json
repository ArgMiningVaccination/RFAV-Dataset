Rosenwasser 331 Pharmacoeconomics of allergic diseases Linda Cox ContentsGlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGY xIIIPREfACE Allergic diseases are affecting the lives of more than one billion people worldwide. With an epidemic rise during the last 60 years, their prevalence is expected to reach up to 4 billion in 2050s. Because of immense numbers of affected individuals, the general public confronts huge direct and indirect costs with major effects on macroeconomics due to health-care, loss of productivity and absenteeism of patients. Unfortunately, high number of unmet needs due to missing scientific knowledge in disease mechanisms, prevention, patient care, and social determinants remain to be resolved. T o tackle this huge global health problem, we as the EAACI decided to develop the \"Global Atlas of Al - lergy\" as a follow up of our \"Global Atlas of Asthma\" which was launched last year. With this Atlas, we aimed to gather evidence to call attention to the burden of allergic diseases; to warrant their recog - nition as a main concern in national health strategies; to reveal their priority for research; to describe environmental factors; to evaluate the best ways to prevent and control allergies; to provide guidance on how to overcome barriers; to alert the political bodies to ensure global management approaches. The EAACI Global Atlas of Allergy contains 139 chapters written by 183 authors with 274 illustra - tions and 100 tables. It is developed as a desktop reference for multisectoral usage covering all as - pects of allergic diseases from allergens, epidemiology, risk factors and molecular and cellular mecha - nisms to their management, major current problems in allergies and associated diseases, prevention and control of allergic diseases.

Most commonly, however, it is the skin and the mu - cous membranes that are involved since they represent the frontier between the individual organism and its environment. Allergy often starts in the first three months of life but very rarely at birth, although there is a strong genetic background. Aller - gy in some cases does not persist over life-time; it starts and some patients may out grow their al - lergic disease spontaneously. We should study these patients in - tensively, who spontaneously lose their allergy. Many allergic diseas - es have a chronic course, but there are ways to cure. Allergic diseases can be influenced by psychological processes in a positive or in a neg - ative way. KEY REfERENCES 1. Bergmann KC, Ring J. History of Al - lergy. Basel:Karger, 2014 - in press. 2.

In 1919 Ramirez noticed that blood transfusion could trans - fer allergic asthma and passively sensitize the recipient. In 1921, Prausnitz and K\u00fcstner demon - strated passive sensitization of the skin, since then referred to as the PK-test. The search for reagin, the factor in plasma causing the positive PK- test, was unsuccessful for about 45 years and some rather confus - ing proposals were published, e.g. identifying reagin as IgA. In the 1960's K. and T. Ishizaka published several articles describing an an - tiserum that could block the PK- test indicating that it reacted with reagin. They referred to this anti - serum as anti- E. Not surprisingly considering the very low serum concentration of IgE, they did not succeed in isolating their E. In 1965 S.G.O.

Very small amounts of IgND did, in dose-re - sponse, block the PK-test and the active structure was located in the Fc-fragment. A sensitive radio-im - muno assay was developed for IgND. Extremely low serum con - centrations, in the order of a few nanograms per ml, were found in healthy individuals but, interest - ingly, 10-100 fold higher levels were found in allergic individuals. Purified IgND was sent to the Ishizakas in 1967 and was found to react with their anti- E. In Feb - ruary 1968 the WHO Internation - al Reference Centre in Lausanne, where studies on IgND had been performed for some months, in - vited the two groups to a meeting to review comparative laboratory studies of IgND and E, resulting in the publication of the official re -port on the fifth immunoglobulin class, IgE. The discovery of IgE has had a significant impact on the diagno - sis and management of allergic disease, enabling clinicians to dif - ferentiate between IgE-mediated allergic diseases and other hyper - sensitivity reactions, and to man - age allergic diseases according to their underlying mechanisms. T ests became available that al - lowed a more simple and reliable diagnosis covering a very broad spectrum of allergens. The char - acterization and standardization of allergen preparations for clini - cal diagnosis and allergen specific immunotherapy, ASIT, improved although there is still much to do in this area. An injectable mon - oclonal anti-IgE is now available that eliminates IgE and has an im - portant role in the management of severe allergic asthma, severe food allergy and chronic urticaria.KEY REfERENCES 1.

Johansson presenting RAST in 1974.6GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION A - Allergy - from genetics to mechanisms A protein capable of instructing the immune system to start producing IgE antibodies is called a primary sensitizer Pro-allergenic properties of a protein cannot be separated from the individual being exposed or from the context of exposure Several structural and functional properties have been ide ntified that contribute to allergenicity There is not a single common denominator for allergenicityPatients with type I allergy make IgE antibodies against some, but not against all environmental or dietary proteins they are exposed to. In fact, most allergens belong to a rather limited number of pro - tein families. Can we identify common struc - tural or functional properties of proteins that turn them into al - lergens? Before answering this question, it is important to clearly define what an allergen is. An ab - solute prerequisite for a molecule to be designated an allergen is for it to bind specific IgE antibodies. Not every protein fulfilling that requirement is however also ca - pable of instructing the immune system to start producing these IgE antibodies, i.e. of being a pri - mary sensitizer (Figure 1). Clear examples of allergens not able to do so are those in fruits, nuts and vegetables that are cross-reactive with the major birch pollen Bet v 1. Their allergenicity is dependant on their structural (and functional) similarity to their \"parent\" mole - cule Bet v 1, the primary sensitizer. The more intriguing question is however, what determines wheth - er a protein is capable of being the primary sensitizer. The answer to this question is complex, because Ronald van Ree Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, The NetherlandsAllERGENS - STRUCTURE AND fUNCTION 3a Key messages Allergens - structure and functionpotential endogenous pro-aller - genic properties of a protein can - not be seen in isolation from the individual being exposed and from the context of exposure, which includes timing and dose of expo - sure, and the presence of co-fac - tors that may act as pro-allergenic or anti-allergenic adjuvants (Fig - ure 2). With that in mind, are there com - mon endogenous structural or functional properties that deter - mine allergenicity? Glycosylation per se has often been mentioned as marker for allergenicity, but convincing evidence for such a general claim cannot be found. Some properties of proteins, in - cluding specific types of glycosyla - tion and binding of lipids, seem to determine their role as allergens via interaction with the innate immune system. Many known al - lergens are indeed lipid binding proteins (e.g. Bet v 1 and homo - logues, house dust mite group 2 allergens, lipocalins of pets, plant lipid transfer proteins), and some are glycoproteins (e.g. peanut Ara h 1 and grass pollen Phl p 1). Their lipid ligands and conjugated gly - cans have been shown to interact with pathogen recognition recep - tors such as T oll-like receptors and C-type lectins on antigen-present - ing cells, thereby skewing the im - mune systems towards Th2-type responses and IgE production (Figure 3). In addition, protease activity such as of the cysteine protease Der p 1 has been shown to drive Th2 inflammation. It is important to note that all these in - nate Th2-skewing properties may also turn other proteins without these pro-allergenic properties 7GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION A - Allergy - from genetics to mechanisms into allergens during simultane - ous exposure. In summary, several structural and functional properties have been identified that contribute to aller - genicity, but it is safe to say that there is not a single common de - nominator for allergenicity.KEY REfERENCES 1.

Mechanisms of allergenicity of allergens11GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION A - Allergy - from genetics to mechanisms Members of the same protein family may share IgE and T cell epitopes, which can cause allergic reactions by cross-reactivity Shared IgE epitopes between inhalant allergens and food allergens can induce an immediate IgE-mediated reaction confined to the oral cavity, known as the oral allergy syndrome Cross-reactivity at the T cell level represents one of the mechanisms of worsening of atopic eczema in birch-pollen allergic patients Immunological cross-reactivity is explored as a possible cure for allergy, by inducing cross-reactive regulatory T cells and/or cross-reactive blocking IgG4 antibodiesAllergens belong to a relatively low number of different protein fami - lies according to intrinsic features, e.g. similar amino acid sequenc - es and/or 3-dimensional folding. Members of the same protein fami - ly may share IgE and T cell epitopes, which by cross-reactivity can cause allergic reactions. In this context, birch pollen-related food allergy has been well studied. This special form of food allergy affects more than 70% of birch pollen-allergic patients and is one of the most fre - quent food allergies in adults. Bet v 1, the single major birch pol - len allergen belongs to the patho - genesis-related protein family 10 and homologous molecules are present in various foods, e.g. Mal d 1 in apple, Pru av 1 in cherry, Gly m 4 in soy and Ara h 8 in peanut. Al - though these proteins derive from plant species non-related to birch trees, their primary and tertiary structures are highly homologous with Bet v 1. Bet v 1 contains mainly confor - mational IgE-epitopes, as destruc - tion of its 3-dimensional structure leads to a dramatic reduction of its IgE-binding capacity. Due to similar protein folding, Bet v 1 - homologs contain surface patch - es forming epitopes that may be Barbara Bohle Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria AllERGENS AND CROSS- REACTIVITY 3c Key messages Allergens and cross-reactivityrecognized by Bet v 1 - specific IgE antibodies (Figure 1A). Although not all IgE-epitopes are shared, Bet v 1 - related food allergens contain sufficient epitopes to achieve cross-linkage of IgE bound to the surface of mast cells and basophils. In most cases, this in - duces the oral allergy syndrome, an immediate IgE-mediated re - action confined to the oral cavity. Destruction of the 3-dimensional protein structure, e.g. by gastroin - testinal degradation or heat pro - cessing, reduces IgE cross-reac - tivity, which explains why cooked foods containing Bet v 1-related proteins usually are tolerated by birch pollen-allergic patients. Cross-reactivity at the T cell level depends on amino acid sequence homologies. After uptake by anti - gen-presenting cells, allergens are degraded into short linear pep - tides, which are then loaded onto MHC class II molecules to be pre - sented to T cells (Figure 1B). Pro - teins with homologous amino acid sequences are processed in analog fashion resulting in similar pep - tides. These activate cross-reac - tive T cells to proliferate and pro - duce cytokines. Clinically, T cell activation by Bet v 1-related food allergens may result in a worsen - ing of atopic eczema in birch pol - len-allergic patients. The analysis of the immune mech - anisms underlying birch pollen-re - lated food allergy has markedly 12GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION A - Allergy - from genetics to mechanisms contributed to our understanding how immunological cross-reac - tivity can induce allergy. Birch pollen-related food allergy is now currently investigated as a disease model to elucidate whether immu - nological cross-reactivity can cure allergy, e.g. by cross-reactive reg - ulatory T cells and/or cross-reac - tive blocking IgG4 antibodies.

They are of paramount importance in all but the few regions of the world, where they do not survive due to aridness, extreme cold or high al - titude. IgE binding studies have found that while a wide range of mite proteins can elicit antibodies most induce low or sporadically de - tectable titres (T able 1). T aking D. pteronyssinus as the exemplar, only 3 allergens bind IgE from most people at high titre, Der p 1&2 and the recently recognized Der p 23. The allergens Der p 4, 5, 7 and 21 each elicit IgE antibodies in 30- 50% of mite-allergic subjects and collectively, and sometimes indi - vidually, induce titres of a magni - tude considered important for the induction of disease. The group 1&2 allergens can be readily de - tected in dust and proprietary house dust mite extracts made from mites cultured in optimized allergen-producing conditions.

In most regions of the world, however, they only induce IgE in about 10% of mite-allergic subjects. There are possible ex - ceptions mentioned in uncorrobo - rated reports from Zimbabwe and Japan showing high titre binding, suggesting regional importance. In another example of a regional ef - fect, aboriginals in northern Aus - tralia do not have IgE to Der p 1, 2 or 10, but instead have high titres to the amylase, Der p 4. The profile of allergens responsible for sensi - tisation, thus might vary from the studies conducted in urban tem - perate regions. The main species that cause al - lergic sensitisation are D. ptero - nyssinus and D. farinae . The most abundant, D. pteronyssinus (Figure 1), is essentially the only species found in Australasia and the Unit - ed Kingdom and mixed species are found elsewhere except for D. farinae -rich regions of central and northern Korea, northern Italy and high-latitude areas of east - ern USA, where mites are found in low abundance. The allergens from these species cross react extensively so species-specificity cannot be determined by skin test.

The major allergens in cat, dog and horse extracts are Fel d 1, Can f 1 and Equ c 1, with serum IgE-reactivity in allergic patients of about 95, 50 and 75%, respec - tively. However their proportions may vary between different ge - ographic regions. The serum IgE profile in cat allergy is dominated by Fel d 1, whereas the profile in dog and horse is more complex. Fel d 1 is a secretoglobin glycoprotein composed of 10-20% carbohy - drates, which has been suggested to increase allergenicity via man - nose receptor uptake. Yet another mechanism by which Fel d 1 exerts its allergenicity is via signaling through the innate T oll-like recep - tors 4 and 2. Polysensitization between pets is extensive and a risk factor for severe asthma. The most prom - inent group of cross-reactive al - lergens is the lipocalin family, in - cluding e.g. cat Fel d 4, horse Equ c 1, dog Can f 6 and rat Rat n 1. A second cross-reactive cluster are serum albumins, responsible for the pork-cat syndrome, a rare phenomenon that can lead to se - vere reactions.

This approach to the classification of allergenic trees according to their phylogeny provides useful guidance both for their geograph - ical distribution and typical flow - ering seasons (Figure 1). Thus, Fa - gales trees are widely distributed within the temperate climate zone of the Northern hemisphere and predominantly flower in spring. Oleaceae trees grow in the Medi - terranean areas as well as in oth - er parts of the temperate climate zone. Their flowering season vary according to regions, ranging from early January to June. Cupres - saceae plants are widely distrib - uted in parts of Europe, Asia and Northern America, with pollina - tion periods occurring between January and April, depending on the region.

In Northern and central European countries, a high prevalence to birch pollen was observed while reactivity to cypress was generally low. Sensitization to olive was most abundant in Switzerland and Greece suggesting an involvement of cross- reactive ash-tree pollen. The majority of sensitized patients (66%-75%) displayed clinical symptoms to the allergen permission G, et al. relevance of inhalant allergen lyases and polygalacturonases. Natural purified Cupressaceae allergens display extensive IgE cross-reactivity, which is partly due to the presence of cross-reac - tive carbohydrate determinants. In addition, the overlap of flower - ing period with winter flu seasons complicates the clinical diagnosis of Cupressacea pollen allergies.

The grass family ( Poaceae ) includes >600 genera and >11,000 recognized species with a wide distribution. Over 95% of allergy-relevant grass species belong to three sub - families; Pooideae , Chloridoideae and Panicoideae (Figure 1 and 2). GlObAl DISTRIbUTION Depending on climate and geogra - phy, grass pollens represent major contributors of airborne allergens during spring as well as summer. They grow on all continents and represent 25% to 35% of the temperate climate zones; Chlorodoideae cover the North American, African and Australian continents and Panicoideae grow in tropical and subtropical envi - ronments of Asia, Australia, Africa and South America (Figure 3). AllERGENS Of GRASS POllEN Grass pollen allergens are grouped according to their protein struc - ture and function (T able 1). They are named according to the offi - cial nomenclature (www.allergen. org), i.e.: Phl p 1 = grass group 1 al - lergen from Phleum pratense (tim - othy grass). T en designated groups GRASS POllEN AllERGENS 3g Key messages Grass pollen allergens consist of major (>50% sensitiza - tion rate, SR) and minor allergens (<50% SR). Due to their abun - dance and potency, grass group 1 and 5 allergens are considered immunodominant major Pooideae pollen allergens (Figure 4). While group 5 allergens are restricted to the Pooideae subfamily, group 1 allergens are present through - out the subfamilies of Poaceae . In contrast, pan-allergens profilin (group 12) and polcalcin (group 7) contribute to ubiquitous cross-re - activity between grass, tree and weed pollen in 10 - 15% of grass pollen sensitized subjects. Present concepts of homologous allergen groups, are based on similar bio - chemical composition, homology and immune cross-reactivity re - flecting in most cases their close taxonomic relationship and have been adopted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). ClINICAl AllERGY bASED ON SENSITIZATIONS Sensitizations to grass pollen al - lergens, indicated by grass pollen allergen (extract) positive skin test or specific IgE, reflect regional plant distribution and pollen ex - posure. Population based sensiti - zation rates are mainly available for Europe and the US and vary considerably between and within countries (Figure 5). Grass pollen allergy is a global problem (Figure 5c). At least half of grass pollen allergen sensitized subjects will suffer from symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or bron - chial asthma, particularly during the warm seasons in moderate cli - mate regions.

While many are herbaceous, some have greater or lesser woody stocks, for example the sagebrushes, Ar- temisia tridentata and A. frigida . Some are prostrate and hug the ground, while others, such as giant ragweed, Ambrosia trifida , may be over 3 meters high. Herbaceous varieties may be annuals or per - ennials. Weeds found in numerous botanical families can be inducers of allergic rhinitis and asthma, but a few families stand out with the majority of aeroallergen sources. Amaranthaceae contains the pig - ( Cheno- podium ). The latter three groups were earlier placed in a separate family, Chenopodiaceae. More recent systematics has, however, redefined this group as a subfam - ily of Amaranthaceae. The major tumbleweeds of the North Amer - ican Great Plains are Russian thistle ( Salsola kali ) and burning bush ( Kochia scoparia ): both are introduced plants.

Asteraceae (previously known as Compositae) is the largest family of flowering plants (Angiosper - mae), and contains several noto - rious inducers of pollinosis. The genus Ambrosia contains all the ragweeds, including several re - classified from the discarded ge - nus Franseria .

Class I aller - gens are often resistant to heat, degradation and digestion. Class II allergens are mainly labile and eas - ily degradable. According to these characteristics the clinical mani - festation is influenced by the type of allergens to which an individual is sensitized. The class I allergens have a higher potential to induce severe reactions compared to the easily degradable class II food al - lergens, which induce often symp - toms restricted to the oral cavity. Due to such reasons, great efforts have been made in the last few years to identify and characterize individual food allergen molecules in the most prevalent allergenic foods (http://www.allergen.org/; http://www.allergome.org/; http:// www.meduniwien.ac.at/allergens/ allfam/) and to - regions.Barbara Ballmer-Weber University Z\u00fcrich allergensMore than 65% of plant food al - lergens are members of just four protein families/superfamilies: the prolamin, cupin, Bet v 1 and profilin family (T able 1).

At school age, adolescence and adulthood cross-reactive food al - lergy is dominating. According to new epidemiologic data sensitiza - tion to the respective food aller - gens is heavily dependent on the exposure and sensitization to in - halant allergens. In a recent study including adult participants from eight European centres the preva - lence of IgE to foods ranged from 6.6% (Iceland) to 23.6% (Switzer - land) and was significantly corre - lated with the prevalence of sensi - tization to birch-pollen-associated allergens Bet v 1 and Bet v 2 (pro - filin), whereas IgE sensitization to non-pollen-related plant allergens were more evenly distributed.

A similar association of sen - sitisation to pollen from the Betu - laceae family, particular alder, and the development of fruit allergy was observed in Japan. Sensitiza - tion to food LTP is highly prevalent in Mediterranean countries and associated with a higher rate of systemic reactions. Also in China sensitization to peach LTP , Pru p 3, was associated with a high rate of systemic reactions. Differences in the sensitization pattern were also demonstrated for children with peanut allergy from three different geographic regions. Spanish patients were mainly sensitised to non-specific LTP (Ara h 9), Swedish patients to the Bet v 1 homologous allergen Ara h 8 and US patients to the storage proteins in peanut Ara h 1, Ara h 2 and Ara h 3.

Social insects have de - veloped a division of labour with sterile females forming a work - ing class. Female workers have a stinger by which venom is injected during a sting into the skin. Within the Aculeatae , Vespidae (vespids), Apidae (bees), and Formidaceae (ants) are social insects (Figures 1 and 2). Vespidae are divided into the subfamilies Polistinae and Vespa. INSECT VENOMS Insect venoms contain a complex mixture of toxic proteins and pep - tides, of which some may induce IgE-mediated sensitisation. T oday, 12 molecular allergens of hon - ey bee venom, and 5 of Vespula venom are known and have been sequenced (T able 1). For some of these allergens, isoforms have been detected. Major allergens are characterized by the fact that there is corre - sponding specific IgE-antibodies (sIgE) in the blood of the majority of allergic patients. Major aller - gens are probably more important than minor allergens in terms of Franziska Ru\u00ebff Ludwig-Maximilian University Munich, GermanyVENOM AllERGENS 3j Key messages Venom allergenseliciting an allergic reaction.

Phospholipase A2, hyaluronidase, and acid phosphatase are the ma - jor bee venom allergens. Major allergens of Vespula venom are Phospholipase A1, Hyaluronidase, and Antigen 5. Some allergens of Vespula and bee venom share mi - nor to moderate sequence iden - tity and show a corresponding cross-reactivity. However, the closer is the taxonomic relation - ship of insects the greater is the overlap of biochemical structures of molecular venom allergens.

Venom allergens from Polistinae or Dolichovespula are more related to Vespula venoms. In-vITRO DIAGNOSTICS Of VENOM SENSITIZATION Demonstration of venom-specific sensitization is essential for diag - nosing an insect venom allergy and is also a prerequisite to select the proper venom for immunothera - py. T o identify venom-specific IgE in human blood, insect venoms are in use since the seventies. In the late eighties, purified allergens were produced. T oday, one recom - binant allergen component of hon -ey bee venom (Api m 1) and two of Vespula venom (Ves v 1 and 5) are available for routine diagnostics. It is assumed that in the near fu - ture more molecular compounds will be available to identify venom sIgE. In contrast to certain food al - lergies, where the sensitization patterns were found to be associ - ated with mild or severe allergic reactions and can be used for risk assessment, for venom allergy, the clinical relevance of a certain pattern of venom sIgE remains un - clear. T esting sIgE to single venom al - lergens is of major importance for improving sensitivity and specific - ity of in-vitro diagnostics. Using recombinant allergens improved the value of assays testing sIgE to the whole venom. Another problem for the diagnosis of insect venom allergy is the dou - ble positivity although presuma - bly the patient only suffers from one allergy. Double positivity may be due to true double allergy, to cross reactivity between allergen compounds of honey bee and Ves - pula venoms, and to sensitization to widespread cross-reactive car - bohydrate determinants (CCD), which are present in many aller - gen sources from plants and ani - mals. The latter, however, usually do not act as allergens. Allergen compounds, which are free from CCD improve the specificity of in vitro testing. KEY REfERENCES 1.

This in turn has revolutionized in vitro diagnosis, by determining the range of cross reactivities and establishing aller - gen panels. Of special interest is the identification of marker aller - gens: allergens that tend to induce rather severe symptoms versus allergens that rather account for mild symptoms. It is only a minority of proteins that exert allergenic activity. T o date allergens can be assigned to 2% of all known protein families. According to allergen databases, the dominating protein families among animal-derived food gens are tropomyosins, pro - lamins, cupins and PR10 proteins are the 3 most important plant protein families (T able 1). ANIMAl-DERIVED fOOD AllERGENS Tropomyosins are highly con - served eukaryotic proteins with a typical coiled-coil structure that are necessary for regulating mus - cle contraction. So far, allergenic tropomyosins have been identi - fied from e-vertebrates, highly cross-reactive among crustaceans and mollusks, as well as inhalant Karin Hoffmann-Sommergruber Medical University of Vienna Vienna, AustriaEMERGING AllERGENS 3k Key messages Emerging allergensallergens from mites and cock - roaches. Parvalbumins share an EF-hand domain binding Ca2+ and thus are involved in signaling pathways or Ca2+ transport. These major food allergens were identified from fish and amphibians, but not from higher vertebrates. Caseins are a major heterogenous protein fraction in mammalian milk displaying a random-coiled structure. They function as Ca2+ binders and allergenic caseins and are highly cross-reactive among mammalian species. So far sensitization to carbohy - drates has been regarded as of low clinical importance in allergic diseases. However, recently, aller - gic reactions to alpha-gal epitopes were observed in meat allergy. Previous administration of mono - clonal antibody doses induced the sensitization event. This highlights that alternative exposures have to be considered if new and unex - pected cases of allergies occur. PlANT-DERIVED fOOD AllERGENS The non-specific lipid transfer proteins (LTP) and the 2S albumins belong to the prolamin superfam - ily. Both types of proteins display a rigid tertiary structure and are resistant to enzymatic and ther - mal treatment. Non-specific-LTPs are involved in plant defense, and are relevant allergens in various fruits, nuts and pollens. 2S albu - mins are seed storage proteins and together with the proteins from the cupin superfamily they represent important allergens in seeds and nuts, usually evoking severe symptoms in patients. The PR10 proteins , involved in plant defense, are present in pollen as 35GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION A - Allergy - from genetics to mechanisms well as in plant food, usually evok - ing mild oral symptoms. Eventual - ly, they can induce severe symp - toms as in soy allergy. In conclusion, a number of aller - gens are now available for compo - nent-resolved in vitro diagnosis. Analysis of their physicochemical features, especially their 3D struc - ture contributes to our under - standing of protein stability, range of cross reactivity and changes in allergenicity during thermal or en - zymatic treatment.

Their prevalence have been increasing since dec - ades and an end is not in sight. Pollen is a natural product and shows a large geographical and climatic variability. Indeed, natural variability is so large that a simple prediction of pollen load depend - ing on the year long experience is not possible. This has led to the im - plementation of pollen monitoring networks. GEOGRAPHIC fACTORS AND POllEN ExPOSURE Few pollen monitoring networks exist worldwide (Figure 1). In addi - tion, rotorod samplers are used in USA, while Hirst-type pollen traps are frequent in Europe making quantitative comparison between continents challenging. However, similar results emerge: pollen exposure varies substan - tially. For Europe, according to a 20-year average, birch pollen is the dominant pollen with 2-times higher counts than grass pollen in almost all reported locations. Between locations, a 10-fold dif - ference of pollen load was noted (Figure 2). echnische Universit\u00e4t 3l Key messages Pollen allergens and geographical factorsClimate change is reported to influence pollen season for the starting date and for the intensi - ty for early blooming species. The natural yearly variability in pollen exposure is large, making the ef - fect of climate change difficult to predict. An elongation of the birch pollen season was reported only in a few random places. Pollen exposure is mostly dependent on short-term local weather, making on the spot monitoring an essen - tial instrument in determining ex - posure. GEOGRAPHICAl fACTORS AND POllEN POTENCY Pollens are natural products and like wine and strawberries their \"quality\" depends on the climatic conditions at source, which var - ies with the geographical location. The amount of allergen released per pollen is variable between years, locations and even days. In a EU-wide project (www.hialine. eu) the allergen release potency for olive, birch and grass pollen was analyzed with standardized methods. Across Europe, pollen potency varied 12-fold for olive pollen, 10-fold for birch pollen and even more for grass pollen. Also, potency of pollen from olive and birch depended on the origin of emission as potency is deter - mined by weather at the place of emission, not at the place of meas - uring the pollen. Within Germany, a constant 3-fold gradient of birch pollen potency is observed, with 37GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION A - Allergy - from genetics to mechanisms southern pollen being more po - tent that northern pollen. In the same line, olive pollen from Spain released 5 times more Ole e 1 than Portugese olive pollen. The difference in pollen potency could be due to two competing rip - ening processes: allergen expres - sion in pollen increases from zero in the week before pollination to high numbers upon pollination (ripening of Bet v 1). Concomitant - ly the anthers ripen too, and will release pollen when they are ripe and weather is suitable. Thus, bad weather can result in late opening of anthers and consequently long ripening periods for the allergen, resulting in more potent pollen. CONClUSION All investigated aeroallergens:pol - len from birch, olive and grass, but also from cat, dog and horse vary at least 10-fold in allergen release within the same species.

These cytokines play a role in the pro - duction of allergen-specific IgE, eosinophilia, permissiveness of endothelium for the recruitment of inflammatory cells to inflamed tissues, production of mucus and decreased threshold of contrac - tion of smooth muscle cells. The discovery of ILCs has changed our perception of T cells as the major cytokine-secreting effec - tors of immunity and made us aware of completely unappreci - ated innate immune cell sources of effector cytokines. Particularly type 2 ILCs can contribute to Th2 type inflammation similar to Th2 cells in mouse models.

Highly activated epithelial cells undergo apoptosis and shedding takes place. Chemokines are essential players for the recruitment of inflammatory cells, which is followed by survival and reactivation of migrating inflammatory cells and their interaction with resident tissue cells and other inflammatory cells. Innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) play a role in T and B cell activation and recruitment and are early providers of Th2 and T cell recruitment cytokines. Th2 type of an immune environment is characterized by IL -4, IL -5, IL -9, IL -13, IL -25, IL -33 production coming from Th2 cells and tissue cells. Eosin - ophilia is induced by IL -5, IL -25, IL -33. Local and systemic IgE production takes place in allergic patients with the involve- ment of IL -4, IL -13. Other effector T cell subsets, such as Th9, Th17 and Th22 cells also play partial roles in inflammation, mucus production and tissue healing. Smooth muscle, myofibroblasts activation and bronchial hyperreactivity is related to IL -4, IL -9, IL -13, IL -25, IL -33.

Immune tolerance to allergens can be defined as estab - lishment of a long-term clinical tolerance against allergens, which immunologically implies changes in memory type allergen-specific T and B cell responses as well as mast cell and basophil activation thresholds that do not cause al - lergic symptoms anymore (Figure 3). T and B regulatory cells and production of allergen-specific IgE-blocking IgG4 isotype anti - bodies play an essential role in allergen tolerance. Similar mech - anisms of immune tolerance take place in high dose allergen ex - posed bee-keepers and cat owners (who do not develop allergy), after allergen-specific immunotherapy, and in individuals who naturally outgrow allergic diseases.KEY REfERENCES 1.

These cytokines can then activate eosinophils (via IL -5, -13) and mast cells (via IL -9) as well as B and T lymphocytes (Figure 1). In addition, secretion of IL -13 induces mucus produc - tion, smooth muscle contractility, and alternative activation of alve - olar macrophages, which leads to amplification of IL production. ILC2 also secrete amphiregulin, 44GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION A - Allergy - from genetics to mechanisms which may be involved in airway remodeling. TSLP also drives the maturation of immature lung den - dritic cells (DC) to conventional DC capable of presenting antigen to T cells. These allergen-activat - ed DC then initiate the adaptive immune responses characteristic of atopic airway disease. In summary, innate immunity plays a key role in initiating asthma. Rec - ognition of insults by AEC leads to activation of ILC2, which pro - duce Th2-type cytokines, and DC, which stimulate allergen-specific CD4+ T cell responses is necessary for asthma progression.

Epithelial cells also secrete IL -25, IL -33, and TSLP , which activate type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) and dendritic cells (DC). ILC2 cells produce \"Th2-like\" cytokines (e.g., IL -5, IL -9, and IL -13). These cytokines then active eosinophils, mast cells, and goblet cells to cause disease.

ILCP are further differentiated into ROR t, NK, and ILC2 cells through the activities of transcription factors (GATA3, ROR ) and cytokines (IL -7, IL -15). CLP cells also differentiate into Th2 cells through thymic maturation. ILC2 and Th2 cells secrete an overlapping set of cytokines. Adapted from ref. 3.

Before adaptive immuni - ty is induced to environmental or food allergens, the allergen must get through the natural barriers of the body (skin, mucus membranes) and reach the cells of the immune system that are recirculating in the lymph nodes (LN).

After antigen uptake, DCs migrate to the draining LN and present the processed antigen to na\u00efve T cells, leading to clonal expansion and differentiation of antigen-specific T cells (Figure 2). Dendritic cells arriving in the LN report on the type of pathogen or allergen that has been encountered in the pe - riphery, and they subsequently induce CD4 T helper cell differen - tiation (Figure 3), CD8 T cell acti - vation and transfer some of their encountered antigens to B cells. DCs originating from the lungs of house dust mite (HDM) al - lergen-exposed mice are neces - sary and sufficient to induce Th2 sensitization to HDM. Lung and skin DCs also play a crucial role during the chronic phase of the allergic response, by producing chemokines that attract other in - flammatory cells back to periph - eral tissues (Figure 2). In addition, allergen-specific IgE and IgG1, through stimulation of Fc RI and FcRIII respectively, target aller - gens to DCs thus boosting Th2 immunity further.

Triggering of pattern recognition receptors on epithelial cells like the T oll-like receptor 4 or protease activated receptors by allergens leads to the production of epithelial-derived chemokines and cytokines (Fig - ure 4) that recruit DCs and that program the DCs to induce Th2 immune responses. Epithelial cells and other innate immune cells also make endogenous danger signals like uric acid, ATP and High Mobili - ty Group Box 1 (HM-GB1) that can have the same effect on DCs. Patients with atopic dermatitis, al - lergic rhinitis and asthma have in - creased numbers of activated DCs armed with IgE in the inflamed tissues. Not surprisingly, target -ing the function of DCs in allergy constitutes a therapeutic avenue. However, eliminating the function of DCs completely would also in - duce immunodeficiency, and it is much more important to unravel how DCs induce and maintain Th2 immunity selectively, to find new therapeutics for allergy.

However allergic asthma may additionally involve innate, T cell independent immune responses. Several different populations of innate lymphoid cells (ILC), in - cluding natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and CD1-restricted NK1 cells have been previously impli - cated in the regulation of immune responses in the respiratory tract. NK cells are innate lymphocytes, which are a first line of defense against infection and cancer. The airways are a major route of en - try of many important pathogens into the body and the ability of NK cells to respond rapidly to infection suggests an important role for these cells in acute pul - monary infection. Recent devel - opments in our understanding of NK cell subsets support their role in allergic diseases that may contribute to allergen-specific Th1 or Th2 cell generation as well induction or suppression of IgE.

These results demonstrate that circulating NK cells retain effector subsets in humans with distinct cytokine profiles and may display different inflammatory properties. In addition, it has been reported that patients with aller - gic rhinitis had a higher percent - age and cytotoxicity of NK cells compared to nonatopic patients. The mean percentage of IL -4- and IL -13-secreting NK cells were sig -nificantly higher, while IFN- + NK cells were not significantly lower in allergic rhinitis patients com - pared to nonatopic controls.

In humans and other vertebrates, mast cells reside in virtually all tissues, often close to epithelial surfaces (e.g., the skin, respira - tory system, and gastrointesti - nal tract) and near blood vessels, nerves, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Mast cell precursors are generated in the bone mar - row, circulate in the blood, and then enter the tissues where they complete their maturation, be - coming cells with many prominent cytoplasmic granules (Figure 1A & C). These granules are storage sites for mast cell products (often called \"mediators\") that, when re - leased by the cell, have powerful effects on other cell types. Mast cell granules contain most of the body's histamine and virtually all of its heparin, as well as a variety of proteases (T able 1). When mast cells are \"activated\" (i.e., stimulat - ed to release their products), they release histamine, heparin and proteases by \"degranulation\" (Fig - ure 1B & D), and they also secrete many other mediators that are not stored, but are synthesized by the activated cells, including leukot - rienes, prostaglandins, cytokines, chemokines and peptide growth factors (T able 1). Mast cell num - bers can increase in tissues at sites Stephen J. Galli Stanford University Stanford, USAMAST CEllS 9 Key messages Mast cellsof allergic diseases or parasite in - fections, and in other settings. HOW CAN MAST CEllS bE ACTIVATED TO RElEASE THEIR PRODUCTS? Mast cells express on their sur - face hundreds of thousands of high affinity receptors (Fc RI) that strongly bind the Fc portion of IgE antibodies. Individual mast cells can bind IgEs which recognize any of a variety of different aller - gens derived from pollens, foods, dust mites, medicines, etc. Such mast cells can be activated when they encounter any antigens that cross-link two adjacent IgE mole - cules, which results in aggregation of the IgE-bound Fc RIs, signaling the cells to release their products (Figure 1B & D). Mast cells also can be activated independently of IgE, e.g., by products of microorgan - isms, certain neuropeptides, and compounds present in animal ven- oms (T able 2). When large numbers of mast cells are rapidly activated by the sys - temic distribution of an allergen in subjects who have IgE recog - nizing that allergen, anaphylaxis can occur within minutes. Such IgE-dependent anaphylaxis is ab - sent or markedly diminished in mice genetically lacking mast cells (even though they have basophils, another bone marrow-derived cell 54GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION A - Allergy - from genetics to mechanisms figure 1 (A, C) A resting mast cell (shown in a transmission electron micrograph in A and as a cartoon in C) contains many cytoplasmic granules (indicated by arrows in A) and has allergen-specific IgE (yellow symbols in C) bound to Fc RI receptors (green symbols in C) on its surface (B, D).

Such activated mast cells also secrete newly synthesized products that are not stored in the granules. (Modified from Fig. 9.44 in Parham P .

Mast cells activated by IgE and specific antigen can release many or all of the products listed in T able 1. By contrast, other acti - vation mechanisms can result in the relatively selective release of granule-stored products (e.g., in response to certain peptides) or cytokines, chemokines and growth factors (e.g., in response to certain microbial products). type that can bind IgE), showing that mast cells importantly con - tribute to this acute, catastroph - ic and potentially fatal reaction. Through effects of released mast cell products on inflammation and structural cells in the affected tissues (T able 1), IgE-dependent mast cell activation can contribute to late phase reactions (that devel - op hours after allergen exposure) and to the features of chronic al - lergic inflammation (e.g., in allergic asthma). DO MAST CEllS CONTRIbUTE TO HEAlTH, OR ONl Y TO DISEASE? From an evolutionary perspective, mast cells did not develop in order to cause disease. Likely beneficial roles of mast cells include enhanc - ing host resistance to some par - asites and other pathogens and enhancing innate and acquired re - sistance to certain animal venoms. Mast cells also have the potential to limit the pathology associated with certain innate or acquired immune responses through the production of mediators with an - ti-inflammatory or immunosup - pressive effects.

They were first document - ed by Paul Ehrlich more than 100 years ago, but their functional sig - nificance remained enigmatic for a long time. Basophils share certain features with tissue-resident mast cells, including the presence of ba - sophilic granules in the cytoplasm, the surface expression of IgE re - ceptor (Fc RI), and the release of chemical mediators in response to various stimuli (T able 1). There - fore, they have often erroneously been considered as minor and re - dundant relatives or precursors of tissue-resident mast cells. Indeed, in clinical settings, basophils have been used, as surrogates of less accessible tissue mast cells, for the in vitro quantification of immedi - ate-type response to allergens in allergic patients.

Recent development of analyti - cal tools for basophil function in vivo, including basophil-deficient mice, has identified pivotal and nonredundant roles for basophils in a variety of immune responses in mouse models, such as allergic reactions (allergic rhinitis, chronic cutaneous allergic inflammation, systemic anaphylaxis, esophagitis), autoimmun - ity (lupus nephritis), protective immunity against infections with parasites (ticks and intestinal hel - minths), and regulation of innate and acquired immunity (gener - ation of Th2 cells and M2-type macrophages, and enhancement of humoral immunity) (Figure 1). Of note, the number of basophils recruited to affected tissues of model mice is much smaller than that of eosinophils, as observed in allergic patients, suggesting that basophils may also play key roles in the development and exacerba - tion of human allergic disorders in spite of their paucity. Therefore, basophils and their products could be promising targets for the treat - ment of allergic disorders.KEY REfERENCES 1. Karasuyama H, Mukai K, Obata K, Tsujimura Y, Wada T.

Eosinophils are generated in the bone marrow under the influence of eosinopoie - tins (IL -3, IL -5, GM-CSF), released to peripheral blood upon matura - tion, and mainly reside in the he - matopietic and lymphatic organs, such as the bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus. The normal eosinophil blood count ranges from 50 to 500 x 109/L. Eosinophil numbers can increase in various inflammatory reactions, including allergic diseases. Several proposals for the classification of eosinophil-related disorders have been published. In allergic diseas - es, eosinophilia is largely mediat - ed by IL -5 - producing T cells. Clinical observations point to a potential role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. Eosinophil numbers in blood and eosinophil tissue infiltration of - ten correlate with the severity of the disease. Therefore, therapies Hans-Uwe Simon University of Bern Bern, SwitzerlandEOSINOPHIlS 11 Key messages Eosinophilsthat reduce eosinophil numbers are usually effective in allergic dis - eases. Moreover, the numbers of eosinophils in sputum have been shown to predict the success of anti-eosinophil therapies in asth - matic patients. For example, tai - loring of asthma treatment based on sputum eosinophils is effective in decreasing asthma exacerba - tions. The exact role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of allergic dis - eases is currently a topic of inten - sive research. In asthma, eosin - ophil-derived cytotoxic proteins and reactive oxygen species have been shown to damage bronchial epithelial cells, leading to a bar - rier defect. Eosinophils are also a source of lipid mediators, such as leukotriene C4 and platelet-ac - tivating factor, which can cause bronchoconstriction. Moreover, eosinophils can amplify T helper 2 immune reactions by the gener - ation of cytokines. A role for eo - sinophils in experimental asthma has been demonstrated in eosino - phil-deficient mice, which demon - strated reduced T cell recruitment and mucus production, as well as reduced bronchial hyperreactivity. Eosinophils also play a role in tis - sue repair and remodeling pro - cesses. Specific anti-eosinophil treatment by using anti-IL -5 an - tibodies was associated with re - duced fibrosis in allergic asthma and eosinophilic esophagitis. The peribronchial fibrosis was also reduced in experimental asthma induced in eosinophil-deficient mice. Therefore, eosinophils can contribute to organ dysfunction by both cytotoxicity and fibrosis.59GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION A - Allergy - from genetics to mechanisms KEY REfERENCES 1.

(A) Eosinophils originate from multipotent and lineage- restricted hematopoietic progenitor cells. They mature in the bone marrow under the influence of eosinophilopoietic cytokines (IL -3, IL -5, and GM-CSF). Mature eosinophils are released in the peripheral blood and can infiltrate inflammatory tissues as it occurs in allergic diseases. At sites of inflammation, eosinophils are activated and their apoptosis is delayed (reviewed by Geering B, Stoeckle C, Conus S, Simon HU. Living without infiltration of organs outside the hematopoietic and lymphatic systems. (B) An example of eosinophil tissue infiltration: Eosinophil infiltration of the dermis in a patient with drug allergy. The tissue section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (original magnification x63). (C) Eosinophils are multifunctional cells. Following activation of eosinophils, they release granule proteins and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are able to kill pathogens, but also tissue cells possibly causing organ dysfunction. Eosinophils additionally release mitochondrial DNA, which forms together with granule proteins eosinophil extracellular traps (reviewed by Simon D, Simon HU, Yousefi S. Extracellular DNA traps in allergic, infectious, and autoimmune diseases. Allergy 2013;68:409-416). By releasing cytokines and lipid mediators, eosinophils are further involved in immune regulation and remodeling events. Eosinophils60GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION A - Allergy - from genetics to mechanisms Allergy is dependent on the immunologic memory as it re-occurs regularly Allergic symptoms correlate with T cell activation particularly of the Th2 type T cells do also react to allergens in asymptomatic patients and may mediate allergen tolerance by active immune suppressionIMMUNE MEMORY - GOOD AGAINST bUGS, bAD fOR AllERGIC AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES The potency of the immune mem - ory is assumed to be a key event in the evolution that allowed the success of larger organisms over smaller sized creatures and gen - erated longer-lived organisms. However, the ability to remember pathogens has also its downsides. A key feature of allergy is that the symptoms occur again every season. This is similar to the im - munologic feature that memoriz - es determinants on pathogens or other harmless structures such as autoantigens or allergens. The inappropriate immune response caused by dysregulation of the im - munologic tolerance is underlying autoimmune and allergic diseases. Both memory and immune toler - ance are mediated by T lympho - cytes, which recognize immu - nogenic structures by the T-cell receptor (TCR). This receptor is characterized by a very high varia - bility that is generated by multiple gene-segment cassettes that are alternatively rearranged to gen - erate a final gene product. Further variation is introduced by a flexi - ble fusion process that increases Carsten B. Schmidt-Weber T echnical University Munich and Helmholtz Center Munich, GermanyT CEllS 12 Key messages T cellsvariability and, thus, an extend - ed repertoire of TCRs that cover most determinants of our environ - ment is generated. Apart from the sophisticated structure of TCRs, the activation and differentiation of these cells is integrating mul - tiple signals from the tissue, the immune system and the external environment. This integration pro - cess involves antigen-presenting cells (APC) that need to digest the environmental allergen/antigen and present it in a molecule with similar high diversity as the TCR. Major histocompatibility com - plexes, (MHC) bring the digested peptides to the surface of the APC and also deliver additional signals that are essential for the activa - tion or deactivation of T cells. The successful activated T cell will di - vide and after the termination of an immune response some cells (memory cells) will remain. These memory cells are able to quickly expand and reproduce an immune response that has been proven to be successful. It is anticipated that the generation of memory cells is underlying successful immuniza - tions (vaccination) against infec - tious agents. Hyposensitisation by allergen-specific immunother - apy (AIT) may also be governed by memory populations. DECISION MAKING IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM The decision making process is subject of immunology research and has the intention to solve the \"black box\" of immune tolerance mechanisms. The goals are to prevent the loss of immune tol - erance by means of public health initiatives (e.g. pollution control, dietary advices etc.), to increase effectiveness of specific immuno - therapy and similar vaccination 61GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION A - Allergy - from genetics to mechanisms strategies and to develop new therapies that prevent severe tis - sue damage as it occurs in the gut, skin and airways. The decision of the immune system is reflected by the T lymphocyte activity, mainly by their secreted mediators, in - terleukins (IL). Interleukins are typically of the \"Th2\"-type includ - ing IL -4, IL -5 and IL -13, whereas autoimmune or pathogen-trigged T cells usually express \"Th1- or Th17-type\" IL 's and interferons (IFN) such as IFN- or IL -17. IL -4 produced by T cells is essential for the production of IgE, the diagnos - tic key parameter in the detection of allergies. The interleukins have various functions and are charac - terizing the regulatory impact of T cells on other immune cells and on tissue cells. The exploration of T cell mediated signals on tis - sue cells is just beginning and it is already revealed that T cells can directly mediate tissue pathology such as epithelial damage or colla - gen deposition (Figure 1).TERMINATING IMMUNE RESPONSES This holds particularly true for the immune system. T regulatory (Treg) cells represent a key discov - ery that falls into this category, as they are actively suppressing oth - er immune cells particularly Th1, -2 and-17 cells. In fact, healthy individuals are showing immune activation in vitro, suggesting that mechanisms exist that keep these processes under asymptomatic control. Novel immune regulato - ry T cell phenotypes are hypothe - sized to mediate anti-inflammato - ry signals also to tissue cells. AIT is assumed to generate Treg cells and future research and novel phar - maceutical strategies are aiming to reinforce these mechanisms in order to re-construct immune tol - erance under minimal influence on anti-pathogen responses.

IgE-production by B cells entails class-switch recombination at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus into the IgE heavy chain (C ). CD4+ Th2 cells that produce IL -4 and express CD40L orchestrate the differentiation of IgE-switched B cells. It has been suggested that there are two pathways for IgE production after secondary expo - sure to antigen. The first involves the differen - tiation of IgE-switched plasma cells from IgG1+ precursors by sequential switching from C 1 to C , leading to the production of high affinity IgE antibodies by somatic hypermutation (affinity maturation). The second pathway involves the direct differentiation of IgE+ memory B cells generated during the primary immune re - sponse into plasma cells, leading to a robust recall IgE antibody re - sponse. The relative contribution b CEllS 13 Key messages B cellsof each pathway to the generation of disease-promoting pathogenic IgE antibodies remains to be es - tablished (Figure 1). The highly variable correlation be - tween the levels of allergen-spe - cific IgE antibodies and suscepti - bility to anaphylaxis indicates that other factors, such as IgG antibod - ies, have profound influences on IgE-mediated responses. Immuno - therapy to aeroallergens has been shown to stimulate the production of allergen-specific IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies, that protect against disease by inhibiting allergen in - teraction with Fc RI-bound IgE on mast cells and basophils, thus pre - venting their degranulation. Recently, much attention has been given to regulatory B (Breg) cells that inhibit over-activated im - mune responses. Several groups have proposed that a reduction in Breg cells worsens symptoms of allergic disease such as contact hypersensitivity and anaphylax - is. Breg cells are characterized by their production of the negative regulatory cytokines, IL -10 and TGF- . An increased number of IL -10-producing B cells has been found in S. mansoni worm infection and the in vivo transfer of these cells prevents recipient mice from anaphylaxis.

There are four subclasses of IgG (IgG1-4) and two of IgA (IgA1, IgA2), making a total of 9 nine different classes including the subclasses in humans. Every person can produce an anti - body to recognize virtually any po - tential antigen by a combination of mechanisms. The initial repertoire of IgMs generated in the bone marrow by \"V(D)J\" gene recombi - nation and junctional nucleotide variation is highly diverse and is further adapted by antigen stimu - lation of the B cells in the immune response. This results in cell prolif - eration and the formation of ger - minal centers in lymphoid tissues, where they undergo two process - es: somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). SHM introduces point mu - tations in the antigen-binding sites, which may increase or de - crease affinity for antigen result - ing in selection of high-affinity mutants that compete for antigen in a process called affinity matu - ration.

This changes the antibody class and the way it is able to engage dif - ferent effector cells in the immune response. Germinal center reac - tions may also occur in the target organs of allergy. Antibodies of the IgE class are central to the allergic response (Figure 3). They are synthesized and secreted by IgE-expressing B cells that have differentiated into IgE-secreting plasma cells. IgEs bind to mast cells and anti - gen-presenting cells bearing the high-affinity IgE receptor, Fc RI, to sensitize the cells for allergen ac - tivation. Allergen-activated mast cells release the physiologically potent molecules that cause the symptoms of allergy. The activat - ed antigen-presenting cells stim - ulate T helper 2 (Th2) cells, which in turn induce the production of more allergen-specific antibodies in a positive feedback loop primed by allergen. Antibodies of the same or cross-re - acting specificity, but another an - tibody class can compete with IgE for antigen binding to prevent or suppress the allergic response. This may occur in specific allergen immunotherapy, which stimulates a modified Th2 response, causing a massive up-regulation of IgG4 and IgA2. Some of these antibod - ies may recognize the allergen and Hannah Gould Yih-Chih Chan King's College London London, United Kingdom65GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION A - Allergy - from genetics to mechanisms figure 1 All five antibody classes have the same basic \"immunoglobu - lin\" structure with two heavy- and two light-chains, each with variable-re - gions (white) containing the anti - gen-combining site and class-specific constant-regions shown in different colors. The distinctive constant re - gion of the IgE heavy-chain is shown in green. Carbohydrates attached to the protein are depicted as small purple circles. The different constant-regions are encoded in a tandem array in the germ line immunoglobulin heavy- chain gene locus on human chromosome 14, downstream from the heavy-chain variable-region of the expressed heavy- chain gene. figure 2 Class switch recombination is required to express IgE. The immu - noglobulin heavy-chain locus contains the rearranged variable (VDJ) region linked to a transcriptional enhancer (E) and a series of three elements re - quired for expression of the complete heavy-chain, an \"intervening\" exon (I), a switch region (S) and a constant re - gion (C). During class switch recombi - nation the VDJ, I and proximal part of S are recombined with the distal part of S within another germ line gene cassette (I, S, and C distinguished by Greek letters corresponding to the newly expressed antibody class). The intervening sequence is deleted and the ends join to form a circle. Prior to recombination, specific cytokines stimulate germ line gene transcrip - tion from the I exon promoters of the two genes that subsequently undergo recombination. The germ line gene transcript corresponding to the gene to be expressed helps to instigate the subsequent recombination. The I exon promoter in the switch circle, now attached to the previously expressed gene, remains transiently active, producing a circle transcript whose sequences can be used to identify the genes that re - combined.

These cytokines lead to B cell proliferation and further switching to IgE in B cells expressing other isotypes in a positive feedback loop, resulting the generation of even more IgE. figure 4 Natural exposure to allergens may induce allergen- specific IgE production in sensitive individuals by stimulation of antigen- presenting cells in a T helper 2 (Th2) immune response. This IgE sensitizes effector cells (mast cells, basophils and eosinophils) and the generation of allergen-specific IgE by B cells. Exposure to high-doses of allergens through immunotherapy induces IL - 10/IL27 release from dendritic cells leading to suppression of the Th2 by deviation of T cell differentiation into the T helper 1 cell and T regulatory (Treg) cell pathways.

Reduced barrier func - tion is due to a combination of gene mutations encoding skin barrier proteins such as filaggrin with the downregulation of epithelial dif - ferentiation protein levels induced by Th2-type cytokines and IL -22. Loss of filaggrin has been linked to enhanced allergen penetration into the skin, increased S. aureus growth and S. aureus infection (Figure 1). Staphylococcus aureus triggers and maintains skin inflammation in AD via the production of virulence fac - tors, such as superantigens and al - pha toxin (Figure 2). Superantigens are potent poly - clonal T cell activators that also stimulates cytokine release from antigen-presenting cells (Figure 3). Evidence supporting a role for superantigens in AD include the observation that most AD pa - tients make IgE antibodies direct - ed against superantigens found on their skin and the presence of these IgE antibodies to superan - tigens correlate with skin disease severity.

In asthma, dendritic- and epithelial-derived chemokines elicited by the inhaled allergens recruit and activate Th2 cells and eosinophils through CCR4 and CCR3, respectively, contributing to the generation of an IgE-mediated inflam - matory response. In COPD, chemokines released from lung epithelial cells and macrophages following exposure to cigarette smoke and/or pollutants generate a neutrophilic/monocytic-enriched infiltrate driven by Th1/Th17 cells that contributes to the inflammatory response and determins lung structural damage.

Chemokines' range of regulatory competences has been widened over the last decades, as almost all cell types, including structural cells such as fibroblasts, endothe - lial and epithelial cells, as well as tumor cells have been found to express regulated profiles of func - tional chemokine receptors. By regulating cell proliferation, differ - entiation and apoptosis functions, and - either directly or indirectly - controlling angiogenesis and ex - tracellular matrix remodeling, the chemokine system is also central to cancer-related inflammation, angiogenesis, tumor cell survival and invasiveness, and is critically involved in the step-wise process of wound healing.Inhibition of leukocyte recruit - ment is a major mechanism of glu - cocorticoids' anti-inflammatory action and a major goal for novel therapies selectively targeting specific recruitment pathways. Antagonism of chemokine-me - diated functions offers major challenges, partly due to member redundancy in each subclass, but mostly to the complexity of the control of their expression, which spans from transcriptional to post - translational and extracellular ma - trix-dependent mechanisms, that are diversely affected in specific disease settings. Antagonism of single chemokine receptors has so far shown only partial success as therapeutic strategy, and is now flanked by research toward more specific downstream regu - latory pathways modulating the chemokine network.

As a phy - logenetically ancient immune sys - tem, the complement activation system, is a sophisticated network of soluble and membrane-bound proteins. It has evolved to recog - nize \"danger or pattern-associated molecular patterns\" expressed by foreign organisms through \"hard- wired\" pattern recognition recep - tors (PRRs). Activation of these PRRs culminates in the generation of C3 and the production of two pro-inflammatory anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, which induce inflam - mation and the membrane attack complex, which lyses foreign cells. The anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a are potent pro-inflammatory me - diators that bind to specific cell surface receptors and regulate many processes observed in asth - ma including leukocyte activation, smooth muscle contraction, and mucus secretion. Consistent with a role for C3-C3a in asthma, exposure to a variety of environmental triggers of asthma in animal models has been shown Marsha Wills-Karp Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Baltimore, USACOMPlEMENT-MEDIATED REGUlATION Of THE AllERGIC RESPONSE 18 Key messages Complement-mediated regulation of the allergic responseto directly activate complement at the airway surface. Genetic de - letion of C3 in animal models has been shown to protect against the development of allergen-, pollut - ant-, and RSV-induced asthmat - ic responses and Th2 cytokine production suggesting that C3a production at the airway surface serves as a common pathway for the induction of Th2-mediated inflammatory responses thereby driving and/or exacerbating the disease (Figure 1, 2, 3). The exact mechanisms by which C3 regu - lates allergic responses are un - known, but current evidence sug - gests that C3a can both enhance antigen uptake by antigen-pre - senting cells, thereby enhancing sensitization to allergens, and ini -tiate recruitment and activation of various inflammatory cells asso - ciated with asthma pathogenesis (Figure 4). In humans, segmental allergen provocation resulted in a signifi - cant increase in C3a levels in the bronchoaveolar lavage of asth - matics, with no change in healthy volunteers.

Following airway exposure to a variety of environmental triggers of asthma in genetically susceptible individuals, C3 is produced and secreted by airway epithelial cells lining the airways. C3 is cleaved into its active form, C3a, presumably by proteases either contained in the allergens or produced by the epithelium. C3a then binds to its receptor, C3aR1 on antigen presenting cells, enhancing uptake of antigen by these cells. Antigen-loaded APCs then drive the differentiation of na\u00efve T cells to Th2 cells. Th2 cytokines in turn recruit and active the effector cells of the allergic response, eosinophils and mast cells. During the effector phase of the response, C3a can bind its receptor on these effector cells enhancing their recruitment and activation. Growth factors and bronchoactive substances from these cells lead to increased airway smooth muscle growth and contractile capacity.

Lipid mediators of inflammation are difficult to study due to their complex metabolism, chemical similarities and rapid in - activation. Their levels in airways can be measured in bronchial or nasal lavage, induced sputum or exhaled breath condensate, while systemic production can be as - sessed in urine. Regulation of the airways tonus, secretion or inflammation involves numerous mediators (Figures 1 and 2). Respiratory epithelium produces prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), secreted to the apical surface.

Airway inflammation is another characteristic of asthma which, to a variable extent, is responsive to corticosteroids and often associ - ated with allergy. This concept of allergy driving an IgE, mast cell and eosinophilic in - flammation in asthma has been heavily underpinned by involve - ment of the Th2 subtype of T cells capable of releasing an array of cy - tokines and chemokines linked to the allergic cascade. However, this simplistic approach has not been rewarded by thera - peutics targeting individual com - ponents of the allergic cascade, which while identifying selective subgroups of \"responders\" , has not provided a ubiquitous series of treatments where \"one size fits all\" .

Even under basal conditions, the asthmatic epithe - lium shows enhanced expression of biomarkers of apoptosis (e.g. caspases, P85 fragment of PARP) indicating loss of resilience. Asthmatic airways, both in chil - dren and adults, are more vulner - able to common and usually innoc - uous respiratory viruses such as rhinoviruses (RVs) adenoviruses and coronaviruses. When infect - ed with major or minor subclass RVs, asthmatic epithelial cells fail to eliminate the virus adequately leading to enhanced replication, shedding and cytotoxic cell death with pro-inflammatory media - tor release. Such a mechanism explains viral exacerbations of asthma, the relatively weak effect of corticosteroids and the mixed neutrophilic/eosinophilic inflam - matory profile. The primary defect appears to be in the first step of induction of the anti-viral protec - tive cytokines interferons (IFNs) and after ds viral RNA binds to microsomal TLR3 (Figure 2). At least part of this defect can be ac - counted for by the enhanced basal production of TGF to reduce SMAD3 phosphorylation and in - crease nuclear inhibitory signals provided by SOCS1 and 3. Since exogenous IFN could restore de - fective anti-viral defence to asth - matic epithelium in vitro, inhaled IFN could be a novel therapeutic for severe exacerbations. Indeed, when administered at the first sign of a common cold in severe asthma inhaled IFN 1 given dai -ly for 14 days almost abolishes the post-viral exacerbation in parallel with maintaining biomarkers of anti-viral defence in respiratory secretions. THE ASTHMATIC EPITHElIUM DISPlAYS IMPAIRED HEAlING The epithelium also contributes to persistence of asthma through enhancing remodelling pathways in the form of aberrant epithelial repair. Over expression of the epi - dermal growth factor (EGF) family of receptors and their phosphoryl - ation in the asthmatic epithelium increases in proportion to disease severity and is not accompanied by appropriate proliferative respons - es as a consequence of mobilisa - tion of cell cycle inhibitors such as P21waf to the epithelial nuclei where they inhibit cell cycling. The net result of this is delayed epithelial Allergy and the epithelial barriers86GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION A - Allergy - from genetics to mechanisms figure 2 In chronic asthma, there is a defect innate immunity at the level of defec - tive production of interferons when toll-like recep - tors such as TLR3, TLR5 and TLR7 be - come activated by viral nucleic acids as the first step in triggering an an - ti-viral response. This results in virus survival, replication and eventual cytotoxic destruction of ep - ithelial cells with release of inflam - matory mediators that contribute to exacerbations. The defect appears to be in Step 1 of the anti-viral cascade involving defective interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 signalling to the interferon genes with low production of IFN induc - tion, reduced signalling via the common IFN receptor and, therefore, reduced IRF7 amplification of the antiviral cascade in Step 2. The IRF7 pathway itself remains intact. For this reason a small amount of exogenous IFN acting via the common IFN receptor can restore a full anti-viral response as shown in the left bottom panel. It is upon this principle that inhaled IFNb1ais being developed for the prevention/treatment of severe asthma exacerbations. ( From Holgate S. T. Arshad SH, Rob - erts GC, Howarth PH et al.

The epithelium of asthmatic chil - dren displays similar characteris - tics and when grown as a monolay - er and physically injured displays slower and incomplete restitution suggesting that the abnormality is intrinsic to the asthmatic epitheli - um irrespective of age. INADEQUATE EPITHElIAl TIGHT JUNCTION ASSEMbl Y IN ASTHMA There is increasing evidence that the epithelial barrier function is persistently deranged in asthma at the level of junctional integrity. The defective barrier function in asthmatic epithelium persists in differentiated epithelial cell cul - tures following repeated passage indicating an intrinsic abnormality linked to enhanced mucous meta - plasia, reduced cilia-genesis and reduced innate immune respon - siveness. Increased permeability is enhanced by T cell interactions within the epithelium as well as the actions of \"biologically active\" allergens (e.g. proteases), viral in - fection and pollutant exposure, all of which perturb tight junction functions. IS ASTHMA A DISORDER Of EPITHElIAl SENSING Of THE INHAlED ENVIRONMENT? Such a \"pro-asthmatic\" epithelium may have its origin in the way the epithelium senses the inhaled en - vironment, with altered sensitiv - ity being predetermined through altered expression of transcrip - tion factors involved in foetal lung morphogenesis such as SPDEF increase secondary to FoxA2 and NKX2-1 (TTF-1) decrease.

However, both proteases and protease inhibitors can be active players in inflammation Proteases can be endogenous and exogenous. Almost all inhala nt allergens such as pollens, mites and fungi have protease activity. Proteases exert their activity through Protease Activated Receptors, PAR 1-4, which are highly relevant in asthma and other allergic diseases Proteases disrupt tight junctions between the cells, can penetrate into the tissue and directly activate the cells apart from the classical flow of immunological mechanismsProteases are composed of a group of molecules with diverse physiological and pathological ef - fects. The human body is equipped with a variety of protease inhib - itors that counteract and thus control the activity of proteases. However, these protease inhibi - tors can be active participants of inflammation. Proteases are naturally present in all organisms. Depending on their catalytically active site, they are termed as serine, cysteine, aspar - tic and metalloproteases. Endog - enous proteases are produced by inflammatory cells, most im - portantly by mast cells (chymase, tryptase), neutrophils (cathep - sin, elastase) and epithelial cells (thrombin).

The action of proteases can be me - diated through Protease Activat - ed Receptors (PAR) 1-4. They are G protein-coupled receptors and are present almost on all cell types. PAR-dependent action of proteas - es results in: increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by epithelial cells, endothelial cells, inflammatory cells, keratinocytes and fibroblasts; enhancement of IgE production; angiogenesis; in - creased cell migration, infiltration and degranulation of inflamma - tory cells; proliferation and con - traction of airway smooth muscle cells; proliferation and activation of goblet cells and increased mu - cous production (Figure 1). Some activities of proteases are PAR-independent and are ba - sically a function of exogenous proteases. They increase pro-in - flammatory cytokine production by airway epithelial cells, activate eosinophils and increase mucus production. Their highly relevant activity for allergic diseases is the effect of proteases on epithelial tight junc - tions and adhesion molecules. Through their ability to disrupt occludin and claudin molecules and to activate MMP9 (which ac - tivates other cellular proteases), 89GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION A - Allergy - from genetics to mechanisms proteases can penetrate through the intracellular junctions in the mucosal epithelial barrier and ep - idermis. This allows the penetra - tion of the allergenic molecules into the tissues, where they can exert their protease as well as im - mune stimulating activities. This recently emerging concept raises the intriguing possibility that pro - tease activities of the allergens may be critical not only for the maintenance of tissue inflamma - tion observed in allergic diseases, but may also be important in the inception of allergic diseases. In addition, this initial penetration may be subsequently followed by the stimulation of a variety of cell types without the classical IgE and other cellular immune mechanism. KEY REfERENCES 1.

The immunoregulatory mecha - nisms that can mediate tolerance towards allergens in humans have been subject to intensive research during the last decades. These mechanisms have been studied in allergic patients receiving aller - gen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) as well as in healthy individuals, who are exposed to high-doses of allergens, such as beekeepers and cat owners. These human in vivo models have demonstrated that the mechanisms leading to peripheral tolerance to allergens include early desensitization of mast cells and basophils, induc - tion of T regulatory (reg) and Breg cells, regulation of allergen-spe - cific immunoglobulin production and interference with migration and activation of eosinophils, mast cell and basophils in the allergic tissues. Treg and Breg cells play a key role MECHANISMS Of IMMUNE REGUlATION IN AllERGY 23 Key messages Mechanisms of immune regulation in allergyin the induction and maintenance of tolerance towards allergens. These cells produce immunoreg - ulatory cytokines such as -10 and TGF- . TGF- is a pleiotropic cytokine that has a wide range of functions including suppression of B and T cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as control of airway inflammation and air - way remodeling. IL -10 is a key an - ti-inflammatory cytokine, which inhibits effector T cell activation directly through suppression of co-stimulatory pathways in T cells, and indirectly through sup -pression of antigen-presentation capacity of DCs. IL -10 also sup - presses mast cell and eosinophil activation, thereby interfering with early and late phase allergic responses. Both Treg and Breg cells contribute to IgG4 produc - tion and suppression of IgE pro - duction. Inducible IL -10-produc - ing B regulatory 1 (Br1) cells are skewed towards the production of anti-inflammatory IgG4 antibod - ies.

The susceptibility of mast cells and basophils to allergen-induced degranulation is reduced already after the first injection of AIT. This may be the result of subclinical lev - els of degranulation of these cells caused by allergen, leading to the increased activation thresholds observed during in vitro measure - ments. Furthermore, rapid up-reg - ulation of histamine receptor (HR) 2 was observed in basophils during the first 6 hours of venom immunotherapy. HR2 triggering could suppress Fc RI-mediated basophil degranulation. Histamine can be released from mast cells and basophils that are activated during AIT and can regulate T cell responses as well. HR2 negatively regulates both Th1 and Th2-type responses. Therefore, HR2 ap - pears to be a key mediator in the suppression of Th2 responses and induction of tolerance towards al - lergens. Intensive research in the area is essential to fully uncover the molecular pathways of aller - gen tolerance. KEY REfERENCES 1. Meiler Zumkehr J, Klunker S, R\u00fcckert B, M.

In addition to the profound dysregulation in in - nate and adaptive immune func - tions, dysbalanced neurogenic re - sponses substantially contribute to the disease (Figure 1). Airway hyper-responsiveness is considered a hallmark of asth - ma. The contractility of airway smooth muscle cells is controlled by several types of neurons in - cluding sympathetic (adrenergic), parasympathetic (cholinergic) and non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons. These types of neurons are part of the complex innervation network of the air - ways and the lung. Neurons control lung function via the axon reflex (Figure 2). This is best described for sensory neu - rons, which pick up stimulatory signals in the airways and transmit them via the sensory neurons to the central nervous system (CNS). Stimuli able to excite these neu - rons include unspecific pollutants such as tobacco smoke particles, ozone and NO2 as well as signals driven from microbes and aller - gens.

Efferent signals are sent back from the cell body of the neurons to the lung periphery. Within the cell bodies, neuropeptides are produced and stored. Afferent firing of the neurons triggers not only the production, but also the retrograde transport of these neuropeptides back to the site of irritation and activation. These locally released peptides (includ - ing tachykinins, neurokinins and others) play an important role in mediating acute pro-inflammato - ry events such as vasodilatation, recruitment of inflammatory cells, activation of mast cells and eosin - ophils and others.

The development of the peripher - al neuronal network, the state of activation, and the differentiation of neurons and various subtypes is tightly controlled by another group of mediators termed neuro - trophins (Figure 3). Neurotrophins belong to a family of mediators, which control neuronal functions and exert also important effector mechanisms on many other cells including immune cells. The pro - totype of the neurotrophin family is the nerve growth factor (NGF). The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and other mem - bers of this family have also been extensively studied. Neurotro - phins signal through two different types of receptors, the pan-neu - rotrophin-receptor p75 and the high-affinity neurotrophin recep - tors TRKA, B and C. These recep - tors are also expressed at various degrees and extend on cells of the innate and the adaptive immune system. An important step forward in bet - ter understanding the neurogenic component in asthma was the de - scription of increased neurotro - phin levels in asthmatic patients (observed in sputum, BAL, tissue, blood). Further mechanistic stud - ies carried out both in human and mice models further revealed that NGF and BDNF play a critical role in maintaining eosinophilia and Th2-driven inflammation, mast cell activation, while enhancing IgE production by B cells. There - fore, neurotrophins are consid - ered major players in the overall maintenance of an already existing inflammatory response (T able 1). There is an urgent need for the development of better diagnostic tools to assess the state of neu - rogenic dysregulation in asthmat - ic patients. The development of novel biomarkers should go hand in hand with the development of novel therapeutic approaches aiming to re-establish neurogenic homeostasis in this disease. KEY REfERENCES 1.

The develop - ment of asthma mostly begins early in life time, and asthma man - ifests before the age of 16 years; usually, this early-onset asthma is preceded by rhinitis symptoms. Over 80% of young children with asthma are allergen sensitized, and atopy in this age group in - creases disease morbidity. Addi - tionally, atopy plays a critical role in the inception of asthma attacks in this age group, in particular dur - ing viral infection. Also in later life, rhinitis is a powerful predictor of asthma, and atopy significantly in - creases the risk for asthma devel - opment in late-onset asthma. A recent Europe-wide epidemio - logic study on the prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a dis - ease manifesting in the nose and paranasal sinuses, confirmed the well-known association between allergic rhinitis and early-onset asthma, but also demonstrated a clearly increased risk of suffering from late-onset asthma in CRS patients.

CRS can be differ - entiated into CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), based on symp - toms (loss of smell is typical for CRSwNP , headache and facial pain are typical for CRSsNP), nasal en - doscopy (presence of bilateral na - sal polyps) and CT scanning. From those phenotypes, CRSwNP has a clearly increased risk of asthma comorbidity in Caucasian popula - tions.

ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION A - Allergy - from genetics to mechanisms Epigenetic modifications result in changes in the expressio n of genetic material and can occur by three processes: DNA methylation, histone modification or microRNA mediated cha nges Like genetics, epigenetic marks are inherited with each cell division and can persist through generations and may account in part for the increased prevalence of allergic disease Genes in immune cells responsible for disease can be epigenetically modified by variables such as environmental exposures, diet, and the microbiome Identical twins with discordant asthmatic status have been shown to have different epigenetic marks on key immunologic genes in their genomeEpigenetics is the study of herit - able changes in gene activity that are not caused by changes in the DNA sequence (Figure 1). These include modifications to the struc - ture supporting the DNA called histones. Histone modification (adding or removing acetyl groups) determines DNA packaging and the cell's ability to access and read the associated sequence. DNA can also be modified directly by adding a methyl group to cytosine bases, which may restrict access to the DNA for transcription into mRNA. Finally, gene expression can be regulated at the post-transcrip - tional level by microRNAs, which can further modify mRNA tran - scripts and histones to alter the expression of genes (Figure 2). Many environmental factors are thought to regulate gene expres - sion through these mechanisms and studies are ongoing to identify specific exposures and pathways of effect (Figure 3). One of the main characteristics of epigenetic changes is that it is passed on to daughter cells with each cell divi - sion so it may have a long lasting effect on cell function. The importance of epigenetics in determining allergic phenotype was illustrated in identical twin EPIGENETICS Of AllERGY 27 Key messages Epigenetics of allergystudies, in which one twin suf - fered from asthma and the other did not. Asthmatic twins were found to exhibit DNA methyla - tion patterns that differed from their healthy counterpart. Most notably, they had increased meth - ylation and decreased expression of the FOXP3 gene, which is im - portant for the anti-inflammatory function of T regulatory cells. Ad - ditionally, they showed decreased function of non-allergic effector T cells through methylation of the IFN-gamma gene. Furthermore, there is evidence that some epigenetic marks can be transmitted from parents to chil - dren trans-generationally, with cumulative effect over multiple generations (Figure 4). This is par - ticularly relevant when consider - ing the epidemiology of allergic dis - ease, which seems to be amplified with subsequent generations. At the population level, allergic sen - sitization seems to have occurred in waves. The first wave was char - acterized by allergic rhinitis and asthma in industrialized countries (US, UK, Australia), more than 50 years ago. The second wave is now food allergy. Interestingly, devel - oping countries are currently just seeing the first wave.

DNA methylation involves adding a methyl group DNA base cytosine (red circle). This prevents gene access to transcription factors and promotes other epigenetic changes. Histones, which are large molecules that act as a scaffold for DNA strands, can be modified on their tails. Modification such as histone acetylation (green stars) can favour histone molecules to spread apart, allowing for an open DNA structure called euchromatin. Other histone modifications have been shown to favour a very condensed state (heterochromatin) in which DNA transcription is impossible. Chromatin remodelling is an active process that requires the intervention of various ATP-dependent enzymes.

The RISC will bind to complementary mRNA sequences and has 2 modes of action: one, it can occlude and prevent translation of the mRNA into functional proteins; two, it can recruit other proteins to degrade the bound mRNA.the world that are skewing people towards an allergic phenotype.

Trans -generational Amplification Hypothesis Figure A Figure Bfigure 4 Figure A depicts a trans- generational model of atopic disease predisposition that is solely based on environmental stressors. This model predicts that environmental pressure directly correlates with an increase in baseline genetic risk for disease only for generations that lived during the changed environment. Figure B illustrates an epigenetic transgenerational inheritance model wherein a change in environment not only increases baseline risk for disease but also induces epigenetic changes in subsequent generations as shown in animal models. This could lead to an amplification of the atopic disease that lasts up to two generations after return to normal environment.

Therefore, targeted treat - ment should be both biomark - er-driven and outcome-driven (Figure 2). The ideal biomarker should be pathway-specific, reproducible, easily measurable, and affordable.

This could result in a substantial improvement in asthma care.

The selection of outcome measures is difficult, as it must reflect the mechanistic intervention and should be rele - vant for both the population as a whole and for the particular indi - vidual. While endotype-driven thera - peutic strategies are becoming increasingly successful in asthma, only feeble attends were made for other allergic diseases. In addition, the issues related to the dissociat - ed effect and drug efficacy at the target site remain unresolved. For asthma the \"Th2 high\" and \"Th2 low\" endotypes are well rec - ognized and used to ascribe spe - cific treatment. Several subtypes of the Th2-high and Th2-low en - dotypes can be described based on the main operating molecular mechanism (T able 1). Applying the same model to al- lergic and non-allergic rhinitis could prove as successful in pro - moting personalized approaches, especially for the severe forms of the disease. The well recognized link between rhinitis and asthma should be integrated and tackled within the framework provided by endotypes. Rhinitis endotypes can be defined in relation to the background in - flammation or in terms of treat - ment responsiveness. The follow - ing endotypes can be proposed for allergic rhinitis: eosinophilic or Th2 (IL -4/IL -13) inflammation; steroid-responsive, anti IgE re - sponsive, anti IL -5 responsive, anti IL -4/IL -13 responsive. non-allergic defini - tion of endotypes (eosinophilic or neutrophilic inflammation, steroid responsive or resistant) should include the driving cause: supe - rantigens, local IgE production, autoantibodies.

Some of the described CRS endotypes were based on different biomark - ers linked to underlying mecha - nisms. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chron - ic inflammatory skin disease with complex genetic and immunolog - ical mechanisms. Several endo - types can be proposed according to the inflammatory background such as Th2/IL -22/periostin high or Th17/Th1 high or in relation to the expression of fillagrin, MATT or vitamin D pathway genes muta - tions. For the Th2 type AD serum periostin is related to disease se - verity. T argeting both the inflam - matory-immune dysregulated pathways or the barrier defect holds future promise. Several new targets such as toll-like recep - tors, type 2 innate lymphoid cells and tight junction proteins are emerging. Promising new thera - peutic agents in the near future are sphinganin, cannabinoids and highly targeted monoclonal anti - bodies. For food allergy phenotypes prove useful for predicting severe reactions. Different phenotypes of children with cow's milk allergy can be distinguished by casein- and milk-specific IgE levels, milk specific basophil reactivity, and milk SPT mean wheal diameters. In another study IL -25 was found highly elevated only in children with a clinical response to peanut, suggesting a role for IL -25 in the pathogenesis of peanut allergy and as a biomarker of a severe at - opic phenotype. For drug allergy several pheno - types were described for the hy - persensivity to non-steroidal an - duced urticaria/angioedema, single NSAID-IgE reactions and single NSAID T cell responses, which differ in terms of the path - ogenic pathways involved, as well as the mediators released after provocation tests.

Endotypes of allergic diseases108GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION A - Allergy - from genetics to mechanisms A wide range of animal models exist for a variety of allergic diseases Animal models are particularly useful for identifying novel cellular and molecular immunological mechanisms of allergy No single animal model completely recreates all the aspects of an allergic responseAnimal models have been devel - oped for almost all types of aller - gic disease such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, anaphylax - is, atopic dermatitis and allergic conjunctivitis. These models are important to examine the mech - anism of the disease, the activity of a variety of genes and cellular pathways, define the role of en - vironmental factors (such as the microbiota), predict the safety of new drugs before being used in clinical studies, define the patho - genic pathways and suggest new therapeutic options. The correct animal model should reflect the disease pathophysiology as close - ly as possible and new models are essential for the development of new therapies. Laboratory mice do not usually spontaneously develop allergies and a range of sensitization and challenge protocols have been developed. The number of sensiti - zations and challenges is decisive for the development of acute or chronic forms of these models. The nature of the allergic disease and inflammatory response is directly influenced by the genetic back - ground of the mice, the allergen, type of the sensitization and chal - lenge protocol and contamination Remo Frei Liam O'Mahony Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research Davos, SwitzerlandANIMAl MODElS Of AllERGIC DISEASE 29 Key messages Animal models of allergic diseaseof the allergen with substances (e.g. LPS), which stimulate the in - nate immune response. Certain protocols require the combina - tion of allergen with an adjuvant, for example aluminium hydroxide (ALOH3, Alum), which is one of the preferred adjuvants in respiratory allergy models. The sensitization, challenge and analysis parameters of murine allergy models are sum - marized in Figure 1. Although murine models of aller - gy provide important insights into the disease mechanisms, there are some limitations that should be considered. In addition to the genetic and physiological differ - ences between humans and mice, there are also limitations due to complexity of this disease. In oth - er words, mice do not develop al - lergy. One can replicate important components of the disease, but no single model accurately models all the features of allergy. This is very important to take into account when choosing the correct model to address the specific experimen - tal question. For example, chronic exposure models are required to examine many of the structural changes associated with allergic responses within the airways. Notwithstanding the limitations of these models, several studies carried out in animal models have given important clues that explain the pathophysiological conditions related to the disease status. For instance, the role of Th2 type cy - tokines and T regulatory cells in the pathogenesis of allergy have been particularly well-studied in animal models. Human clinical studies remain the gold standard for determining the clinical efficacy of new therapeu - tic approaches.

After sensitization, allergic responses are provoked, depending on the model, by oral application (food allergy), by inhalation (respiratory allergy), or by skin contact (skin allergy) with the allergen.

During the last two centuries, this phenomenon has characterized countries undergoing their epide - miological transition phase. Res - piratory allergies (allergic rhinitis and asthma) appeared first among the richest, then spread within the middle class and finally affected also the disadvantaged. Following a similar pattern, respiratory aller - gies and atopic eczema are nowa - days on the rise in middle income countries, especially in the urban areas (Figure 1). More recently, food allergies are clearly becoming more prevalent in westernized populations (Fig - ure 2). This \"second wave\" of the allergy epidemic is already gen - erating a heavy burden on health systems not well prepared to face this new challenge. The increasing prevalence of food allergies is as - sociated with fatal anaphylaxis in children and adolescents. A decline of microbial diversity was proposed since the late nine - ties as a major cause of the allergy epidemic. This area of the hygiene hypothesis, now defined \" biodiver- sity hypothesis \" , has found specific support in several epidemiological studies: 1) respiratory allergies are inversely related to the number of different foodborne infections; 2) a lower diversity of the gut micro - bial flora in the first week of life is associated with atopic eczema at 18 months (Figure 3); 3) the probability of developing asthma in farming children is inversely re - lated to the range of exposure to environmental bacteria and fungi. Two recent studies have coher - ently shown that reduced food diversity in infants' diet is associ - ated with atopic sensitization and allergic diseases later in childhood (Figure 4). A sufficiently high \" an- tigenic burden \" in early life, provid - ed by infections and nutrition, is therefore necessary to properly \"educate\" the immune system and to prevent childhood allergic dis - eases. Current knowledge is a good basis to identify the allergy protective factors and to inspire primary and secondary prevention strategies to revert the allergy epidemic trend.

Not all children with infantile eczema show a sensitisation to food allergens and will develop classical allergy Sensitisation to foods precedes sensitisation to inhalant allergens. Persistent sensitisation before and after 3 years of age is a risk factor for school age asthma Early infantile eczema, early sensitisation during the first 3 yea rs of life and atopic family history are predictors of allergic airway disease and persistence of asthma until puberty Children with infantile eczema often lose their symptoms until school age, although early onset is more frequently associated with persistence until puberty compared to children with later onset of the disease Remission of allergic asthma occurs not frequently up to the age of 20 yearsAllergy is common in children, adolescents and adults. Epidemi - ological studies like the German MAS (Multicentre Allergy Study) showed age-related typical man - ifestations of atopic and allergic diseases. In the \"Atopic March\" infantile eczema and food allergy precede the onset of allergic air - way disease (rhinitis and asthma). However, there are individu - als with isolated allergic airway disease (for example hay fever) starting later in life at school age without any signs of other atopic disease during infancy and pre - school age. Equally, there are chil - dren with infantile eczema with - out any signs of food or inhalant allergy. Furthermore, remission and relapse of disease entities are possible at any time. Studies on the molecular pattern of sensitisation to pollen allergens showed a preclinical phase, where sensitization (IgE antibodies in serum) to certain molecules of an allergen source (grass or birch) precedes symptoms. The likeli - hood of clinical allergy increases with the number of molecules rec - ognized by IgE. ATOPIC ECZEMA The incidence of atopic eczema Susanne Lau Charit\u00e9 Medical University Berlin, GermanyNATURAl HISTORY Of AllERGY 2 Key messages Natural history of allergyand food allergy to cow`s milk, hen`s egg, wheat and soy is high - est during the first 2 years of life in childhood, however, there is a second peak of new onset of atop - ic eczema in puberty for females. Two third of young children with infantile eczema will lose their symptoms up to the age of three years. However, those children de - veloping atopic eczema later in life (after the age of 5 years) are more likely to outgrow their eczema compared to those children, who had an earlier onset of disease (during the first year of life).ASTHMA In the German MAS cohort, the prevalence of asthma is 4% at 6 years of age and more prevalent in boys and 9% at age 20 years. The incidence of allergic asthma is highest during preschool and early school age (Figure 1). There is a second peak for new onset of asthma in females at puberty. Atopic family history is a major risk factor for the development of asthma (Figure 2). 29% of the German MAS cohort children with complete follow-up showed wheezing episodes during the 116GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION b - Epidemiology and risk factors first three years of life (early wheezers). 9% started wheezing between the age of 3 to 6 years (late wheezers) and another 9% started wheezing after 6 years of age (very late wheezers). Early persistent wheezers (early start of wheezing before 3 years of age, wheezing also after 6 years of age) showed the highest rates of atopy. In this group, early atopic eczema, parental atopy and early sensitiza -tion (<3 years of age), especially to perennial allergens, turned out to be the major risk factors for per - sistence of asthma/wheeze at age 11-13 years. IGE SENSITISATION TO AllERGENS The first allergens recognized by the immune system in terms of IgE production are food allergens. The most frequent food allergens inducing IgE-mediated sensitiza - tion are hen`s and peanut. Although, sensitisation to inhalant allergens like cat, house dust mite and pollen allergens can be present already during the first 3 years of life, in most of the chil - dren the clinical relevance is ob - served later, at school age. Atopy (sensitisation) in general is a risk factor for asthma at school age (Figure 3).figure 1 Incidence of asthma in the German MAS cohort. ( From Matricardi PM, Illi S, Gr\u00fcber C,et al.

AllERGIC RHINITIS There is a constant rise for the in - cidence and prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) from preschool and early school age until puberty. Allergic rhinitis until the age of 5 years was found to be a risk factor for subsequent wheezing onset with an adjusted relative risk of 3.79 (p<0.001). This association was not attributable to the type of sensitization, the severity of sensitization or atopic dermatitis during the first 2 years of life. On a population level 41.5% (95% CI: 20.0-61.3) of all new cases of wheezing was attributable to preceding AR. Neither AR until the age of 2 years nor non-aller - gic rhinitis until the age of 5 years were significantly associated with wheezing onset in childhood. The first manifestation of AR oc - curs in preschool children, where it is a risk factor for subsequent wheezing onset. Preschool chil - dren with rhinitis might thus ben - efit from early assessment of al - lergic sensitization to identify the children at high risk of developing wheezing. AllERGIC RHINITIS: SENSITISATION TO AERO- AllERGENS The 12-month prevalence of sen - sitization to indoor or outdoor al - lergens in the German MAS cohort rose with each time point of as - sessment, reaching almost 60% of all boys and a third of all girls at the age of 13 years (in children with one or two allergic parents).

There - fore, the best way to study aller - gies is to recruit new born babies and follow them as they grow (so- called birth cohort). Birth cohorts overcome problems related to the lack of accuracy (or completeness) of the recollections when patients are asked about the events, which occurred many years ago. Such studies permit careful longitudinal assessment of symptoms, sensiti - zation status, physician diagnoses and medication usage, and objec - tive measures such as lung func - tion. Allergies are heritable, but despite lots of effort, we have had limited success identifying what genes are important, and this has yet to im - pact on patient care. Many factors in the environment contribute to the development of allergies (for example diet, immunizations, an - tibiotics, pets and tobacco smoke), but we don't know how to modify the environment to reduce the risks.

Birth cohorts in The EArly Genetics and Lifecourse Epide - miology (EAGLE) Consortium are extensively collaborating to inves - tigate the genetic basis of allergy and asthma-related phenotypes in childhood. Numerous early breakthroughs have already been made. The on - going birth cohort studies offer the best chance of identification of children at increased risk of al - lergy.

There is a deficit in public aware - ness, education and training and an urgent need for efficient preven - tion strategies. The rising trend in allergies has been associated with changes in life-style, such as im - proved hygiene measures, smaller family sizes and control of infec - tions, which, taken together, result in an \"under-challenged\" immune system. On the other hand, life- style changes include the exposure to potentially harmful - indoor and outdoor - environmental pollut - ants suspected to keep our immune system in a constant state of alarm. How does this fit together? INDOOR RISK fACTORS In the western civilization, most individuals spend a considerable part of their lives indoors. Indoor exposure to mite, molds, chemi - cals and inhaled particles can elicit and/or exacerbate allergic diseas - es. The best assessed among the indoor pollutants are volatile or - ganic compounds (VOCs) and en - vironmental tobacco smoke (ETS), which is a mixture of VOCs, carbon monoxide and solid particles.

We recently identified ambient ozone as a major factor influencing al - lergen content and adjuvant lipid composition of birch pollen. This illustrates how anthropogenic environmental factors, via their effect on the allergen carrier, can indirectly influence the health of allergic patients. ClIMATE CHANGE RElATED RISKS Global warming is associated with elevated CO2 levels and pro - longed vegetation periods. This, in turn, causes prolonged flower - ing seasons, which might increase the load of allergenic pollen. The aggressive spreading of allergen - ic neophytes, such as Ambrosia artemisiifolia , in southeastern and parts of middle Europe already led to de novo sensitizations in the exposed populations. Moreo -ver, exposure to Ambrosia pollen might induce symptoms even in mugwort-sensitized patients due to the high degree in inter-species cross-reactivity. KEY REfERENCES 1.

Control measures should be based on allergen exposure monitoring performed accord - ing to well-defined and validated methods. T o measure exposure to airborne allergens, it is imperative to report the presence of the sources of al - lergens (mite counts, presence of pets), because allergen levels can stay high when there are no sourc - es or their number is low. The choice of optimal procedures depends on the setting and ob - jectives of allergen monitoring (Figure 1): epidemiological (pop - ulation) studies on exposure-re - sponse relation, intervention studies, diagnosis and follow-up of individual patients, hazard identi - fication for disease clusters, iden - tification of cases of \"new allergy\" , as part of routine monitoring or of a health surveillance program.

A dust sample is collected from the bed, carpet or sofa by vacuuming a square yard area of the bed/carpet/sofa per 2 minutes with a vacuum clean - er with a collection device. The presence of allergens is quantified with an ELISA test. Recently, an alternative wipe sampling method has been implemented to collect allergens from floor dust, where allergens are measured by a re - al-time quantitative PCR meth - odology. However, methods using settled dust might not provide ac - curate measurements of inhaled allergens. T o measure airborne allergens in the air, a technique has been developed that involves collecting an integrated total suspended particulate sample through an impactor. Extracts of air samples are then analyzed by a modified ELISA using an amplifica - tion of the generated colorimetric signal. The prevalent outdoor allergens are pollens and molds. Usually, pollen and mold counts are as - sessed,and not their derived aller - gens. A pollen count is nothing more than a measurement of how much pollen is in the air. It is expressed in terms of a concentration of pol - len in the air in a specific area at a certain point in time. The exact measure is grains of pollen per cu - bic meter over a 24 hour period.

Envi - ronmental factors must account for the apparent rise, not genetic predisposition. An over-arching effect may be the immune dys - regulation attributable to the \"hygiene hypothesis\" . Additional theories to explain increased ato - py, with food allergy as a bystand - er, include vitamin D insufficiency attributable to greater use of sun - screens and less time outdoors, reduced consumption of healthful omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants, and in - creased obesity, which may repre - sent an inflammatory state. How - ever, for environmental influence on food allergy in particular, the role of exposure to food proteins becomes relevant. Probably as a response to early studies suggesting that infants ex - posed to whole cow milk proteins were at higher risk of milk aller - gy compared to those receiving breast milk or hypoallergenic for - mula, among other observations, various expert panels and profes - sional organizations suggested avoidance of allergens for infants at risk. Some guidelines included allergen avoidance during preg - nancy and lactation. The goal was Scott H.

However, mounting studies sug - gest that extended avoidance of food allergens may be a risk factor for food allergies, rather than pre - ventative. Why would this be? One possibility is that earlier exposure allows for oral tolerance. For ex - ample, in a study of the rate of pea - nut allergy among Jewish children in the United Kingdom compared to Israel, there was a ten-fold high - er rate of allergy in the UK, where early peanut consumption was comparatively very low (Figure 1). Timing of ingestion may only be part of the story. Non-ingestion routes of exposure may be strong - ly sensitizing: for example, despite ingestion of raw fruits, many per - sons develop pollen-food related syndrome caused by inhalation of food-homologous proteins in pollens, bypassing oral tolerance. Similarly, it was suggested that topical exposure, especially via in - flamed skin, i.e., atopic dermatitis, during abstinence from oral expo - sure could be a sensitizing route bypassing oral tolerance (Figure 2). Additional evidence is the ob - servation that household con - sumption rates of peanut, particu - larly messy products that increase environmental exposure, are a risk factor for peanut allergy, especial -128GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION b - Epidemiology and risk factors ly if the infant has not ingested peanut early.

The resulting changes in lifestyle led to both a major increase in time spent in - doors and progressive \"improve - ments\" in homes. These changes not only allowed accumulation of allergens in fitted carpets, so - fas, bedding, etc. but in humid cli - mates allowed abundant growth of dust mites. Over this same pe - riod, almost all studies have shown strong associations between sen - sitization to indoor allergens and asthma in children over 5 years old and young adults (T able 1). ExPOSURE IN THE HOME AND IN THE COMMUNITY AS A CAUSE Of SENSITIZATION Children spend up to 95% of their time at home, at school or in other enclosed spaces. Initially it was assumed that the home had to be the primary site of sensitization; however, two findings have con - fused the simple message. 1. Studies designed to avoid expo - sure to dust mite carried out in Manchester and Sydney have not succeeded in preventing sensitization to this allergen. Thomas A.E. Platts-Mills University of Virginia Charlottesville, USAENVIRONMENTAl RISK fACTORS fOR AllERGY: HOME ENVIRONMENT 4d Key messages Environmental risk factors for asthma: home environmentThe explanation for that find - ing appears to be that relevant exposure to mite allergens can occur in other houses. In cities in the UK or coastal Australia most other houses in the com - munity will contain mites. In Northern Sweden or Chicago, very few children become aller - gic to mites because the houses are too dry for mite growth. 2. Many but not all studies on cat exposure have found less sensi - tization to cats among children with higher exposure (Figure 1). For cat allergens, it is now clear that Fel d 1 on dander particles is present in schools and homes without a cat. Thus, exposure of children without a cat is suffi - cient to cause sensitization. RElATIONSHIP Of SENSITIZATION TO ASTHMA Although sensitization to indoor allergens is strongly associated with asthma this relationship is not simple. Sensitization as judged by skin prick tests is common in non-asthmatic children and also may be common in rural villages in Africa or Ecuador, where none of the children have allergic asthma. However, one of the striking fea -131GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION b - Epidemiology and risk factors tures of asthma among children and adults in westernized or post hygiene societies is that titers of IgE antibodies to mite, cockroach, cat and Alternaria may be very high i.e. 30 IU/ml. We have seen highly significant association be - tween the titer of IgE antibodies to mite or cat and the severity of asthma (Figure 2). Furthermore, studying children in Costa Rica, we found a strong association be -tween the titer of IgE antibodies to mite and the impact of commu - nity acquired rhinovirus infection on wheezing (Figure 2). CONClUSIONS The increase in asthma has been documented as \"wheezing\" in ISAAC, as use of inhalers, or as presentation with acute asthma either to ED or hospital. In each of these settings, evaluation of sensitization has shown a strong correlation between asthma and the perennial and predominantly indoor allergens. In rural settings in Africa, Ecuador, Nepal, etc., sen - sitization as judged by skin prick tests may be present, but wheez - ing is more likely to correlate with evidence of Ascaris or other par - asitic infections.

Thus all relevant exposure is in the form of particles. The aerodynamic properties of the particles determine how long they remain airborne and their volume decides how much allergen they can carry (5). Glycosylated with alpha-gal; *Glycosylated with MUXF3 Environmental risk factors for asthma: home environment132GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION b - Epidemiology and risk factors there is consistent evidence that the western model of asthma re - lates to higher titers of IgE anti - bodies to one or more of the per - ennial allergens. Thus, overall we have a model where, increased time spent indoors in overheat - ed and under ventilated buildings leads to sensitization to the pre - dominant allergen in the commu - nity, which may be derived from mites, cockroaches, or animal dan - der. The major rise in prevalence of asthma in children is most likely to be due to the combination of in - creased exposure to indoor aller - gen and the associated sedentary lifestyle. KEY REfERENCES 1.

Apart from exposure, host factors may determine the risk of occupa - tional rhinitis and asthma.

Giv - en its significant health as well as socioeconomic burden, investiga - tors around the world have sought to define environmental and ge - netic factors that contribute to asthma inception in early life. One important environmental factor demonstrable in multiple studies has been respiratory tract infec - tions. From a genetics perspective, atopy and genetic variation at the 17q21 locus (that appears to be independent of atopy), are risk factors for asthma development. Interestingly, both appear to be dependent, at least in part, on an - tecedent preschool human rhino - virus (HRV) wheezing illnesses. EARl Y CHIlDHOOD RESPIRATORY VIRAl INfECTION AND ASTHMA IN CHIlDHOOD Although early childhood respira - tory syncytial viral (RSV) infec - tions have been documented to contribute to future asthma risk, recent advances in molecular diag - nostic testing have enabled inves - tigators to establish a relationship between HRV wheezing illnesses and asthma. In an evaluation of a high risk birth cohort, Jackson et al. found that infection with HRV RISK fACTORS fOR CHIlDHOOD ASTHMA: VIRAl INfECTION AND AllERGIC SENSITIZATION 4f Key messages Risk factors for childhood asthma: viral infection and allergic sensitizationin the first three years of life was the virus most significantly asso - ciated with the development of asthma at age 6 years (Figure 1). Mechanisms responsible for these developments are currently being intensely evaluated. Wark et al. found that cells from asthmatic pa - tients had decreased production of both type I and III interferons, two important cytokines in the host's innate immune response to viral infections. Recently, Caliskan and colleagues demonstrated that al - lelic variation at a highly replicable genetic locus for asthma was asso - ciated with significant asthma risk only in children who wheezed with HRV (not RSV) infections in early life. Since genes contained within this locus have functions that in - volve calcium membrane flux and the unfolded protein response, it is possible that alterations in these pathways may further in - fluence host immune response to viral infections at critical times in the lung development. Recently, infections with HRV-C have been noted to be associated with more significant clinical illnesses that may be of even greater severity in atopic children. COMbINED VIRAl INfECTION AND AEROAllERGEN SENSITIZATION The relationship of atopy with the subsequent development of asth - ma is widely recognized. Aeroal - lergen sensitization in the first 2 to 3 years of life has been report - ed to be a risk factor for the sub - sequent development of asthma. Frederick J. Rubner Robert F. Lemanske Jr. University of Wisconsin Madison, Wisconsin136GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION b - Epidemiology and risk factors The development of multiple early sensitizations increases not only the risk of developing childhood asthma, but its clinical severity in terms of hospital admission rates as well. Preschool viral wheezing illness - es and the development of aller - gic sensitization can both inde - pendently increase asthma risk. The presence of both can further influence the development of asthma, as demonstrated by data generated independently in two high-risk birth cohorts. In one of the high-risk birth cohort, aeroal - lergen sensitization without doc - umented preschool RV wheezing increased asthma risk by age six years (OR = 3.4) (Figure 2). If both RV wheezing and aeroallergen sensitization were present at age three, the risk of developing asth - ma by age 6 years was substantial - ly increased (OR = 80). Jackson et al. longitudinally eval - uated which development occurs first: allergic sensitization predis - posing to viral-induced wheez - ing, or the reverse. Using a four stage statistical model, the study found that allergic sensitization is more likely to precede viral-in - duced wheezing. Moreover, HRV wheezing illnesses were the most likely infections accounting for this temporal developmental se - quence. Allergic sensitization may increase lower airways inflamma - tion and symptoms based on the ability of IgE receptor numbers and bridging to be associated with reduced dendritic cell production of type I and type III interferons with decreased viral host defense (Figure 3). INflUENCE Of HRV WHEEZING IllNESSES INDEPENDENT Of ATOPY Genome-wide association studies of childhood asthma risk have re - vealed a high susceptibility locus on chromosome 17q21. Genetic variation in this 17q21 region has been associated with increased childhood asthma risk but not with atopy. Caliskan and col - leagues demonstrated that this association is in fact limited only to children who had HRV wheez - ing illnesses in the first three years of life.3 Importantly, this geno -type-attributable increased risk is totally independent of allergic sensitization (atopy). CONClUSION At least two distinct mechanistic pathways may predispose chil - dren to asthma (Figure 4), both dependent on antecedent HRV wheezing illnesses. The first path - way, termed 17q21, appears to be dependent on an asthma suscepti - bility locus and totally independ - ent of the presence of allergic sen - sitization. The second pathway, termed Fc RI, is dependent on the development of allergic sensi - tization. Continued evaluation of mechanisms responsible for these pathways hopefully will provide insight into disease treatment and prevention strategies. KEY REfERENCES 1.

Risk factors for childhood asthma: viral infection and allergic sensitization138GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION b - Epidemiology and risk factors In developing countries, large differences exist in the prevalence of allergies between rural and urban areas as well as between high and low socioeconomic status (SES) groups within urban areas Helminth infections, which are ubiquitous in rural areas and among low-SES urban dwellers, drive T-helper 2 (Th2) responses High levels of total IgE and allergen-specific IgE are seen in helminth-infected subjects, but these do not translate into skin reactivity or clinical symptoms Regulatory network induced by helminths and helminth-induced IgE cross-reactivity prevent the translation of Th2 respons es into allergic disorders Allergen-specific IgE has limited diagnostic value for allerg ic disease in helminth-endemic areasOver 1 billion people worldwide are infected with parasitic worms. Most of these individuals are found in tropical regions of the world, where such infections are linked to poverty and rural living. Both helminths and allergens are potent inducers of T helper 2 (Th2) responses that lead to high levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) E, tissue eosinophilia, mast cells as well as the secretion of Th2 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL -5, IL -9 and IL -13. Despite the similar immunologi - cal profiles associated with both helminths and allergies, there is little overlap in the geographical distribution of these two health problems. Moreover, in develop - ing countries, among urban popu - lations of high socioeconomic sta - tus (SES), improved hygiene and fewer infections have been linked to an increase in allergic disor - ders. Indeed, a number of studies have found a negative association between helminth infections and allergic disorders among rural and low SES urban populations within these countries (Figure 1). Mechanistically, chronic helminth infections have been shown to in - duce an immune regulatory net - work in the host characterized by ENVIRONMENTAl RISK fACTORS fOR AllERGY: HElMINTH INfECTIONS 4g Key messages Environmental risk factors for allergy: helminth infectionsregulatory T and B cells, alterna - tively activated macrophages and modified dendritic cells (Figure 2). This leads to an anti-inflammato - ry environment that prevents the down-stream effector phase of Th2 responses associated with al - lergic disorders. However, the tim - ing and duration of helminth infec - tion are key, since infections early in life and/or chronic infections are more effective in down-modulat - ing allergic disease. In addition, the species of helminth is also an important determinant in the modulation of allergic disorders. Another mechanism that might explain the inverse association between helminth infection and allergy may involve helminth-in - duced IgE cross-reactivity. Cur - rent helminth infections are as - sociated with increased levels of allergen-specific IgE that do not translate into skin reactivity or clinical symptoms (Figure 3). Moreover, this helminth-induced IgE appears to be of low affinity and does not lead to mast cell de - granulation. In fact, in developing countries, strong correlations are observed between allergen-specific IgE and symptoms of allergy among urban Abena S. Amoahfirdaus HamidHermelijn H.

However, in rural populations as well as ur - ban low SES groups, helminth-in - duced IgE cross-reactivity and regulatory networks may prevent the translation of allergen-specific IgE into skin reactivity or allergic symptoms (Figure 4). Therefore, allergen-specific IgE has limited diagnostic value for allergic dis - ease in helminth-endemic areas. Future studies taking an interna - tional perspective will be essential for our understanding of environ - mental risk factors and underlying mechanisms to develop new treat - ments that can halt the allergy ep - idemic worldwide.

Such exposure triggered an initial \"default\" response com - prising low-level Th2-immunity, including specific IgE production, which was eventually terminated by emergence of specific T-regu - latory cells (Tregs) that induced a state of long-lived immunological tolerance, protecting the animals against sensitization at subse - quent re-exposures. These find - ings served to focus human stud - ies on the etiology of atopy on the life period (infancy), during which the na\u00efve immune system first en - counters allergens. A number of resultant observations attest to the validity of this approach: (i) data from birth cohorts (Fig 1) demonstrate an initial induc - tion of aeroallergen-specific IgE in both atopic and non at - opic children during infancy, preceding subsequent stabi - lization of \"tolerized\" versus \"sensitized\" immunopheno - types, as the immune system progressively programs alter - nate forms of T-cell memory;Patrick G.

Over the last decades an increase in the preva - lence of allergic diseases has been reported worldwide. From pro - spective birth cohort studies, pos - sible protective and risk factors have been identified (T able 2, 3). A family history of allergic disease (asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivi - tis, atopic eczema or food allergy) in first degree relatives, is strongly associated with an increased risk for allergic disease. Considering that the increase in the prevalence of allergic diseas - es cannot be ascribed solely to genetic factors, most studies on development of allergic diseases have focused on the influence of in environmental factors, e.g. ear - ly feeding (breastfeeding vs. cow's milk formula), diets/nutrients, exposure to allergens, tobacco smoking, pollution, farm vs. urban environment, and infectious load.

Such associations can only be used for generation of hy - potheses. Many hypotheses on causes of the increase in allergic diseases have been suggested, most often without convincing and consist - ent results (T able 4). The concept of the hygiene hypothesis has been extensively investigated and has influenced our understanding of early-life events. According to this hypothesis, early exposure to common bacterial triggers such as endotoxins, LPS or helminths might have an allergy preventive effect. The hygiene hypothesis may in part explain the increase in the incidence of allergic diseases . However, multifactorial environ - mental factors may play a role and interact (T able 3). A strong association between ex- posure to allergens and IgE sensiti - zation has been documented and also a strong association between sensitization and development of allergic disease, such as allergic asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis. Sensitization to foods appears first, followed by sensitisation to indoor allergens (e.g. house dust 144GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION b - Epidemiology and risk factors mites, pets) and later by sensiti - sation to outdoor allergens (e.g. pollen, mould). However, sensiti - zation may be a transient normal phenomena followed by develop - ment of tolerance. THE CONCEPT Of AVOIDANCE For decades, primary prevention addressing prevention of sensiti - zation and development of clini - cal allergic disease has mostly fo - cused on avoidance of exposure to allergens (e.g. foods, indoor aller - gens). Over the last decade, a new concept of primary prevention has emerged. Earlier it was believed that breastfeeding and avoidance of cow's milk proteins could pre - vent development of cow's milk protein allergy. However, human milk contains cow's milk proteins, if the mother has an intake of cow's milk. Other food proteins are also present in human milk. Thus, for - eign proteins cannot be avoided by exclusive breastfeeding. The concept of avoidance of foods dur - ing breastfeeding is wrong. Infants are exposed to small amounts of foreign proteins ( reduced expo - sure ), which may rather lead to tolerance than to clinical allergic disease. Furthermore, breast milk contains many immune-modulat - ing factors that may influence the development of allergy (T able 5).TAblE 2 Predictors for sensitisation and persistent allergic disease Predictors for sensitization and allergic disease Atopic heredity Elevated cord blood IgE Early sensitization to foods and aeroallergens Persistent sensitization Predictors for persistent allergic airway disease into adolescence/adulthood Persistent sensitization High degree sensitization and polysensitization Early onset of persistent asthma Severe disease Reduced lung function Presence of another atopic disease TAblE 3 Possible environmental factors influencing development of allergic diseases Risk factors Protective factors Allergen exposure Exclusive breastfeeding 4-6 months T obacco endotoxins, LPS, introduction of solid foods?Diets/nutrients?

Historically, microbiologists have isolated and grown microorganisms to identi - fy pathogens causing disease. The advent of DNA based sequencing methods has allowed amplifica - tion of DNA from microorganisms and thereby identification of a large variety of microorganisms that have never been cultured before. The Human Microbiome Project has shown that the hu - man body contains trillions of mi - croorganisms, which outnumber human cells by 10 to 1 (Figure 1). Their genes encode products es - sential for human survival. In the gastro-intestinal tract microbes break down many of the proteins, lipids and carbohydrates from our diet into nutrients so that we can absorb them. Moreover, microbes produce beneficial compounds such as vitamins. The microbiome also profoundly affects the host's immune response. Mice raised under germ-free conditions have profound deficits in innate and adaptive immunity suggesting that the microbiome educates a child's immune system. Experimental studies in mice, fur - thermore suggest that the micro -Erika von Mutius Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital Munich, GermanyTHE ROlE Of MICRObIOME 7 Key messages biome has a role for the develop - ment of allergic diseases. Germ free mice develop more easily al - lergic asthma than conventionally raised mice. Reconstitution of ne - onates\u2014but not adult\u2014germ free mice with a conventional micro - biota protected the animals from allergic disease. This protective effect may be mediated by activa - tion of immune responses by mi - crobial compounds. Alternatively or additionally metabolites secret - ed by microbes such as short- chain fatty acids may mediate these beneficial effects. Changes in the microbiome will occur with diet and antibiotics as long as they are ingested. But also microbial exposures in the environment will affect the microbiome and there - by the risk of allergic diseases. Children being raised in environ - ments rich in microbial exposures such as on traditional farms (Fig - ure 2) have a much lower prev - alence of asthma, hay fever and allergic sensitization as children grown up in urban settings. The di - versity of the microbial exposure has been shown to account for the asthma-protective farm effect (Figure 3). In urban areas high ex - posure to environmental microbes (e.g. by keeping dogs indoors) also relates to a lower prevalence of allergic disease. A recent mouse study has demonstrated the piv - otal role of the gut microbiome in mediating this protective environ - mental exposure. Some birth co - hort studies also suggest that the composition of the gut microbiota may be a predictor for the onset of atopic eczema in young children, but these observations are not consistent and need further con - firmation.

Skin tests are widely used for the diag - nosis of inhalant allergies, but also allergies to foods, venom, occupa - tional agents and drugs can be in - vestigated by skin tests. TYPES Of SKIN TESTS AND REQUIREMENTS Skin prick tests (SPTs) and intra - dermal tests are still the corner - stone of the diagnosis of IgE-me - diated (type I) allergy. Especially SPTs are widely used (Figure 1). As they are usually easy to perform, cheap and allow a fast reading, they are an ideal tool for bedside diagnosis. Intradermal also named intracutaneous testing (Figure 2) is more demanding, but allows by titration of various allergen con - centrations a very accurate rating of the sensitization level. Epicutaneous or patch tests are used in patients with suspected type IV allergies for contact der - matitis or delayed type of drug hypersensitivity. Due to its po - tentially scar-inducing effect skin testing by scratching is limited to some special aspects of drug or mostly occupational allergens. The atopy patch tests (APT) may help to find out causes of exacerbation in atopic dermatitis or Eosinophil - ic Esophagitis, but its value is still controversial. Performing skin tests needs a specific training, es - pecially for intradermal and epicu - taneous tests with nonstandard - ized allergen material. Contraindications such as the use of some drugs, pregnancy or other conditions precluding some types of allergy testing should be evalu - ated. Also the skin condition of the patient must allow testing in the skin. Patients have to abstain from medications such as antihistamin - ics that could mask a positive type I reactions; on the other hand con - ditions such as dermographism/ pressure urticaria able to provoke false positive skin reactions must be considered. Using controls such as histamine for positive and saline as negative controls are cru - cial for SPT/intradermal testing.SKIN TESTS fOR INHAlANT AllERGENS SPT are the classical diagnostic tool get prompt information about sensitizations against inhalant al - lergens such as pollen, house dust mites, pets and, to a lesser extent moulds. As they are usually easy to perform, cheap and allow a fast reading, thus an ideal tool for bed - side diagnosis. Recommendations for standard series of SPT solu - tions are available for many geo - graphic and climatic regions. Skin prick tests can also be used in tropical areas and in countries with limited resources, where al - lergy is booming. However, local allergens may not necessarily be identified or available and can therefore be missed for skin test - ing. For example, it is crucial to include allergens such as Blomia tropicalis in the skin test battery of tropical countries.IN VIVO AllERGY DIAGNOSIS - SKIN TESTS 1 Key messages In vivo allergy diagnosis - skin testsJulia Katharina Genser Peter Schmid-Grendelmeier University Hospital of Z\u00fcrich Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland151GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION C - Allergy diagnosis In vivo allergy diagnosis - skin testsTAblE 1 Difference between basophils and mast cells Skin Prick T estIntradermal T estsEpicutaneous (Patch) T estsAtopy Patch T est Inhalant StandardRarely few available allergensn.a.Some forms of atopic dermatitis1 Food allergy++ With commercially available extracts and fresh n.a.Eosinophilic esophagitis?

T est - ing with fresh food enables a fast detection of sensitization also to foods individually provided by the patient or only locally available. As skin testing does not discriminate between sensitization and clinical relevant food allergy, additional tools such as food allergen oral provocation tests, elimination diets and more recently compo - nent-resolved in vitro diagnosis are indicated. Intradermal testing with food allergens is not recom - mended. SKIN TESTS fOR HYMENOPTERA VENOM AllERGY Skin testing for hymenoptera venom allergy is a very reliable and useful diagnostic tool. While SPT with venoms has limited sen - sitivity, intradermal testing with increasing concentrations allows the detection of the sensitization threshold, with high sensitivity and specificity. Concentrations starting at 0.00001 g/ml with a ten-fold increase in doses at each step till 1.0 g/ml are used. Simul - taneous testing with two hyme - noptera venoms seems to be safe and allows fast bed-side diagnosis. SKIN TESTS IN DRUG HYPERSENSITIVITY Skin tests are a very useful but also delicate tool to investigate drug hypersensitivity. Especially for in - tradermal testing of soluble drugs, the ideal concentrations need to be evaluated. In a recent position paper of the ENDA/EAACI Drug Allergy Interest Group drug con - centration for skin testing aiming to achieve a specificity of at least 95% have been postulated. Cur - rently such drug concentration can be recommended for beta - lactam antibiotics, perioperative drugs, heparins, platinum salts and contrast media. For many oth - er drugs, there is still insufficient evidence to define an appropriate drug concentration. KEY REfERENCES 1.

Allergen inhalation challenge mimics the natural situation and is useful for understanding the mechanisms of allergic airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Moreover, provocation tests play an important role in the diagnosis of asthma, and to a less - er extent also in AR. Via a bron - chial provocation test (BPT), AHR can be measured by challenging the airways with a variety of phys - ical and inhaled chemical stimuli resulting in airway constriction (Figure 1). The airway narrowing is measured by changes in FEV1 after gradually increasing the dose of provoking agent. A nasal provocation test (NPT) is used in case of a typical history of AR and a negative allergy test (Figure 2). It is of importance to differentiate AR from non-allergic rhinitis since management may be different. A positive test result is defined by the presence of symp - toms typical for AR plus objective parameters, such as decreased upper airway patency (measured with acoustic rhinometry or an -IN VIVO AllERGY DIAGNOSIS- NASAl AND bRONCHIAl PROVOCATION TESTS 2a messages In allergy diagnosis nasal and bronchial provocation teststerior rhinomanometry) or nasal secretion of inflammatory media - tors. Patients can have immediate or dual responses. METHODS Different methods for NPT and measurement of nasal respons - es are used. Medication that may interfere with the results should be stopped prior to the test and contra-indications should be ruled out. If available, it is advised to fol - low a validated and standardized protocol. Inhaled allergen challenge starts early in the morning in order to measure a late asthmatic response. Ideally, patients are observed for a longer period. It is strongly recom - mended to perform BPT in a clini - cal setting. In daily clinical practice for AHR diagnosis, the preferred agents are histamine, methacho -line and mannitol. These agents give a bronchoconstrive response that is less prolonged and quickly reversible with bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. Diag - nosis of occupational asthma and rhinitis may require specific inha - lation tests. lIMITATIONS Inhaled allergen provocation tests are safe in a dedicated setting with experienced staff. Several objec - tive and validated parameters to measure response are available for BPT, but not for NPT. Allergen application may produce nonspe - cific reactions. A limited number of standardized allergen extracts are commercially available. Aller - gen challenge can result in a tran - sient increase in symptoms and medication use.

Generalized reactions are rare after BPT, but asthma exacerba - tions may occur. After allergen challenge the magnitude of the bronchoconstriction may be more difficult to control than with direct challenges, such as histamine or methacholine. Moreover, the in - duced bronchoconstriction is usu - ally prolonged due to the release of proinflammatory mediators. Therefore, it is necessary that during an inhaled allergen provo - cation a doctor is present, the res - cue medication is ready to use and a resuscitation set is available on the ward.

Diagnosis of food allergy can be obvious, for example in the case of a child reacting with urticar - ia 10 minutes after having eaten peanuts. In this case caused by an IgE-mediated reaction, skin prick tests and in-vitro diagnosis, by measuring specific IgE in the se - rum, are most often positive and clearly relate to the symptoms. Food challenge might be done in patients with vague symptoms possibly related to food allergy, with a significant proportion of patients having positive IgE tests not related to the symptoms but to an atopic predisposition (false positive tests indicating only sen - sitization). In this context, a food challenge will be the gold standard for diagnosis (Figure 1). HOW DO WE DO fOOD CHAllENGES? Several variables have to be taken into account when organizing a food challenge. Most important - ly, the food challenge must be designed in a safe way. The food challenge must be performed in a location, where emergency medi - cation can be administered.

In all cases, the food challenge must be super - vised by nurses trained to recog - nize early signs of reactions. Also, the supervising physician must be trained in order to have sufficient experience in interpreting the various clinical signs possibly ob - served during a food challenge. The food is provided to the patient in increasing doses. The starting dose, as well as the time interval between the doses, will be deter - mined by the initial history of the patient and by the purpose of the challenge. A food challenge aiming to determine the threshold level of a reaction will start with a very low dose. The food can be administered openly, but also in a double-blind placebo controlled manner. Dur -ing this procedure, the challenge is separated into two parts, the food being hidden in a vehicle in order for blind both the patient and the examiner (Figure 2). lIMITATIONS Of A fOOD CHAllENGE A well designed food challenge will provide definite information about the presence or the absence of a food allergy. Nevertheless, one needs to be aware of some caveats. A food challenge is valid only for the type of preparation of the food. As an example, patients may react to raw egg, but not to cooked egg, and a patient with a negative challenge to cooked egg might afterwards react to a prepa - ration with raw or not completely cooked egg. Similarly, a negative challenge to a specific fish does 157GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION C - Allergy diagnosis figure 1 Decision tree for food allergy including either an open food challenge, or a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC).

A well designed food challenge is the definite diagnostic tool for food allergy. In addition, it is also a very useful tool in the follow-up of food allergic patients. A positive food challenge provides valuable information to the patient on how the reaction could take place and how to treat it, thus increasing the patient's quality of life. KEY REfERENCES 1.

In patients with single NSAIDs induced type of reactions, ASA is rarely a culprit drug, so OPT with the suspected NSAID may be performed. In pa - tients with NERD, bronchial or nasal challenges with the soluble form of ASA (lysine-ASA) may be an alternative to OPT to confirm/ exclude NSAIDs hypersensitivity. ORAl PROVOCATION TEST Oral challenge with ASA is recom - mended in patients with suspect - ed respiratory or cutaneous form of reactions to NSAIDs. Appropri- ate safety measures should be fol - lowed and contraindications con - sidered (T able 1). In patients with NERD, the two day protocol starts with placebo capsules adminis - tered on the first day, every 1.5-2 hours, with FEV1 measured every 30 minutes to establish baseline variability (T able 2). On the second day, the patient receives initially 10-30 mg of aspirin and the dose is Marek L.

The test is negative if none of the above ap - pears and the final ingested dose of 312 mg of ASA is well tolerated. A similar protocol, with extended intervals between ASA doses is indicated for the diagnosis of the cutaneous type of NSAIDs hyper - sensitivity (T able 3). TESTING WITH OTHER NSAIDS OPT can be used for testing hyper - sensitivity to other culprit NSAIDs or to assess tolerance to an alter - native NSAIDs in patients with both cross-reactive and immu - nologically-mediated reactions. Even if no immediate indications for treatment with NSAIDs exist, the potential patient's need for an analgesic, antipyretic or anti-in - flammatory treatment should be anticipated. T ests with alternative NSAIDs usually start with the oral administration of half of the ther - apeutic dose followed by monitor - ing in the doctor's office up to two hours. INHAlATION PROVOCATION TEST In patients with NERD, inhalation or intranasal challenge with Lysine (L)-ASA (a soluble form of acetyl - salicylic acid) can be used as an alternative to ASA-OPT (Figure 1) The bronchial provocation test start with the inhalation of a dil - uent, followed by increasing dos - es of L -ASA administered using 159GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION C - Allergy diagnosis In vivo diagnosis of NSAID hypersensitivityTAblE 1 Indications and contra indications to oral aspirin challenge in patients with NSAIDs hypersensitivity Indications Ambiguous or not clear history of response to aspirin/NSAIDs Confirmation/exclusion of cross-sensitivity if aspirin is not a culprit NSAID Beginning of desensitization Contraindications History of severe anaphylactic reactions induced by aspirin or other NSAIDs Not well controlled underlying disease (asthma/urticaria) Low baseline FEV1 (below 70% of the predicted value ) Severe delayed type reactions Concomitant disorders potentially aggravated by the challenge TAblE 2 Protocol for the oral aspirin challenge in a patient with suspected NSAIDs exacerbated respiratory diseases 8:00 Placebo 10 mga 9:30 Placebo 27 mg 11:00 Placebo 44 mg 12:30 Placebo 117 mg 14:00 312 mg a Optional in patients with a history of severe reaction to NSAIDs TAblE 3 Protocol for oral aspirin challenge in a patient with suspected NSAIDs exacerbated cutaneous disease Time Day 1 Day 2 8:00 Placebo 71 mg 10:00 Placebo 117 mg 12:00 Placebo 312 mg 14:00 Placebo 500 mg a dosimeter at 30 minutes inter - vals, allowing to complete the procedure in an outpatient set - ting in less than 5 hours.

If the positive reaction is observed PD20 ASA is calculated from the dose-response curve. Inhalation challenge may induce extrabronchial symptoms and may also involve a late phase reaction. Both oral and inhaled tests have similar sensitivity and specificity but, as compared to the oral chal - lenge, the inhalation test, is faster and safer to perform (the reaction is usually easily reversible with nebulized beta2 agonists). 160GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION C - Allergy diagnosisAdvantages limitations Oral challenge Gold standard (reliable ) Risk of severe reaction Useful in patients with extra bronchial symptoms Time-consuming bronchial challenge Short duration (< 4 h) Only in patients with bronchial/nasal symptoms Reaction easily reversibleRequires special equipment (dosimeter) Nasal challenge Safe in patients with severe/ unstable asthma Only in patients with bronchial/nasal symptoms Not possible in patients with nasal obstruction The nasal provocation test with L -ASA is particularly recommend - ed in asthmatic patients with low pulmonary function not suitable for bronchial provocation. The challenge starts with instillation of saline followed by L -ASA solution increasing concentrations applied into each nostril every 30 minutes. All parameters (objective and subjective) are recorded every 10 minutes. Alternatively, ketorolac nasal spray solution can be used.

A drug provoca - tion test (DPT) is performed: a) to exclude DH in a non-suggestive history (e.g. unspecific symptoms arising after intake of a penicillin), b) if a cross-reactivity in proven hypersensitivity has to be exclud - ed (e.g. to other pain medications in acetylsalicylic acid hypersen - sitivity), c) if a firm diagnosis in suggestive history of DH with neg - ative, non-conclusive or non-avail - able allergological tests shall be established (T able1). It is consid - ered to be the gold standard for DH diagnosis, required when oth - er allergy tests do not allow rele - vant conclusions. PROCEDURE A drug provocation test (DPT) is the controlled administration of a drug for diagnostic purposes, performed under close medical surveillance with emergency med - ication available and always after an individual risk-benefit analysis. Requirements for a DPT Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen DRUG PROVOCATION TEST 2d Key messages In vivo allergy diagnosis - drug provocation testthe possibility to hospitalize pa - tients, experience with emergen - cy treatment, consideration of pharmacological effects of tested drugs, exclusion of contraindi - cations, informed consent of the patient and sufficient wash-out interval from anti-allergic medi - cation. It is a high risk procedure as it induces symptoms similar to the original ones, albeit normally milder because of initially low and fractionated doses and immediate treatment (Figure 1, T able 2). The oral provocation test is the preferred route for most DPTs, although subcutaneous (e.g. for local anaesthetics, heparins, in - sulins), local or even intravenous provocations (e.g. for heparin) are possible. The time interval be - tween dose escalations and the figure 1 Mild generalized acute urticaria after oral drug provocation test with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid (as in Aspirin\u00ae) in a patient with reported drug hypersensitivity to another potentially cross-reacting pain medication.162GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION C - Allergy diagnosis duration of provocation have to be determined considering the origi - nal reaction and suspected mech - anism. General guidelines for perform - ing DPT have been published and specific protocols are available for some drugs, such as betalactam drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflam - matory drugs or radiocontrast media. INTERPRETATION In the majority of patients, DH can be excluded by DPT. In some pa - tients, the reappearance of reac - tions confirms the diagnosis. False positive and false negative results to DPTs are possible. In medicine, a DPT can never guarantee toler - ance in 100% of patients, but helps to decide, if lifelong avoidance is justified. Studies evaluating the validity of the DPT show that the majority of patients (>95%) toler - ated the drug in real life, if there were no reaction in the DPT and conclude that this test is beneficial for the patient.

In contrast to other allergy tests, ACCs are usually not ap - plied for individual diagnosis, but for assessing allergic treatments, studies in occupational allergy and basic research. At present, there are twelve ACCs active in Europe, USA, Canada and Japan (Figure 1). There is a broad conformity between the systems, although individual differences are to be mentioned. All ACCs are validated for pollen challenges like grass/ birch/ragweed or Japanese cedar pollen; some are also vali - dated for house dust mite or even for cat (Figure 2). The main common feature of all ACCs is a pre-defined and stable allergen concentration in the air, which has to be high enough to induce symptoms in sensitized subjects. In addition, the allergen concentration climatic conditions like temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration are kept sta - ble over several hours. All param - eters are constantly controlled to Friedrich Horak Research Consult GmbH Vienna, AustriaTHE AllERGEN CHAllENGE CHAMbER 2e Key messages The allergen challenge chamberensure high reproducibility of the ACC model. During a challenge session patients record their sub - jective symptoms several times an hour with good compliance. There is usually no application of rescue medication, which could possibly complicate the interpretation of the symptom score. Usually nasal, ocular and/or bronchial symptoms are scored using a 4-point scale (0 to 3). A challenge session lasts at least two hours, because by then a pla - teau is normally reached in all of the patients' symptoms, which will then not vary, if the allergen load is kept stable. This plateau-reaction is usually monitored for two to six hours (Figure 3).In contrast to field or park studies, it is possible to additionally monitor and report objective assessments during the challenge sessions. These objective parameters offer the opportunity to check the proper - ness and accuracy of the subjective scoring (T able 1). Furthermore, it is possible to take blood samples at several time points of the challenge session to follow the ongoing aller - gic reaction. The ACC model is approved by the FDA and EMA, at least for phase II trials and further supporting phase III trials. EMA suggests ACC trials for conducting dose finding trials of immunotherapeutic prod - ucts. Potential fields of application of ACC trials, however, can be more extensive (T able 2).164GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION C - Allergy diagnosis ACC can monitor specific immu - notherapy and reduce the cost of drug development substantially, not only by proof of concept stud - ies. Requiring significantly less time than field studies and small - er numbers of individuals per trial are the essential arguments for application of ACCs. Besides sev - eral advantages some disadvan -tages are to be mentioned (T able 3). The standardization of several ACCs worldwide and the \"be - tween-unit\" reproducibility are still unmet targets.

In some cases, in vivo provocation tests performed with the suspected allergen are needed to confirm the diagnosis The breakthrough allowing the development of highly specific and sensitive in vitro tests for allergic diseases was the discovery of the ''reaginic antibody'' termed immu - noglobulin E (IgE) more than 40 years ago. The prototype for the in vitro detection of serum IgE (the Reto Crameri University of Z\u00fcrich Davos, SwitzerlandIN VITRO AllERGY DIAGNOSIS - AllERGEN- SPECIfIC IgE 3a Key messages In vitro allergy diagnosis - allergen-specific IgEradioallergosorbent test, RAST) first described in 1967 used a pa - per disc as a solid phase to cova - lently immobilize the allergen fol - lowed by the addition of patient's serum. After different washing procedures to remove unbound serum proteins and antibodies, bounded IgE was detected with 125I-labelled polyclonal anti-hu - man IgE (Figure 1). Modern assays for the detection of allergen-spe - cific IgE have undergone impres - sive improvements including the calibration against the WHO Standard 72/502, allowing quan - titative determinations, and the implementation of fully automat - ed devices (Figure 2). T o date the most commonly used system to determine allergen-specific IgE is the ImmunoCAP system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Uppsala) con - sidered as the \"gold standard\" for the in vitro diagnosis of allergic conditions. More recently, novel diagnostic tests based on allergen microarrays have been introduced both in research and clinical prac - tice. Multiplex-based in vitro tools for allergy diagnosis allow a com - ponent resolved diagnostics of the atopy status of a patient in a cost effective way. figure 1 Typical immunoassay for the detection of allergen-specific IgE in three steps: 1) the allergen is adsorbed and immobilized to a solid phase, 2) patient's serum is added followed by incubation during 30-60 min and several washing steps and 3) allergen-bound IgE is detected by an enzymatically labelled anti-human IgE monoclonal antibody Labelled anti-human IgE167GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION C - Allergy diagnosis Despite the relevant technological improvement, several problems related to the in vitro diagnosis of allergy remain unsolved (Figure 3).

A switch to the production of allergen-specific IgE detectable in serum leads to the sensitization of a patient, reflecting its atopic status. However, not all sensitized individuals suffer from allergic symptoms highlighting the limitation of in vitro allergy diagnoses. Allergen challenge tests are needed to confirm the clinical relevance of an allergy suspected from the clinical history and from the presence of allergen-specific IgE in serum.

In fact, more than 20% of the individuals with aller - gen-specific serum IgE are asymp - tomatic. We should be aware that allergen-specific serum IgE is bi - ologically irrelevant as long as it doesn't bind to the high affinity receptor for IgE on effector cells. Therefore, the presence or the absence of allergen-specific IgE in serum is not sufficient to confirm or exclude an allergy in all cases. At the current state of the art, it is worthwhile to maintain a healthy scepticism about allergy diagnos - tic test results solely based on the determination of allergen-specif - ic serum IgE levels and to let the clinical history, corroborated by adequate provocation tests, which drive the diagnosis before consid - ering immunotherapeutic inter - ventions.

The first generation assays, starting from the very first RAST, allowed researchers and allergists to im - prove the diagnosis of IgE-medi - ated diseases. The first generation IgE assays were mainly based on allergenic extracts - a mixture of allergenic and non-allergenic compounds derived from natural sources (e.g. a pollen extract). A great step forward to a broader use of in vitro diagnosis in allergy was achieved in the early nine - ties, when the more reliable sec - ond generation assays appeared in laboratories worldwide and in parallel a new kind of test reagent started to be available. In fact, during the nineties an increasing number of allergenic molecules have been identified, character - ized and, most important, progres - sively translated into the daily use in diagnosis (Figure 1A). Most of the available allergenic molecules have been obtained by using the recombinant DNA technology, allowing cloning and production of recombinant allergens in a re - producible large scale. Within the last decades, allergenic molecules IN VITRO AllERGY DIAGNOSIS - MOlECUlES AND COMPONENT- RESOlVED DIAGNOSIS 3b Key messages In vitro allergy diagnosis - molecules and component-resolved diagnosishave been increasingly used in re - search and clinical studies leading to a cumulative number of scientif - ic publications (Figure 1B). This knowledge is now displayed in several free accessible inter - net-based resources documenting the magnitude of the worldwide allergy health problem (T able 1). The most recent keystone im - provement in this area has been the application of microtechnolo - gy to in vitro diagnosis of IgE-me - diated diseases. In the last decade, a new tool has become available to allergists allowing them the parallel diagnosis on hundreds of allergenic molecules from a huge collection of allergenic sources in a single test run (Figure 2). This multiplex microarray test is now available worldwide and allows allergic patients to be tested with the same panel of allergens re - gardless of age, gender and kind of allergen and route of exposure. Within the last decade, multi - ple studies from many countries around the world independently reported an added diagnostic val - ue by using molecular components for in vitro allergy diagnosis in the singleplex test systems - the more traditional approach in allergy laboratory testing. This progress became mainly evident in some of the most severe allergic diseases such as anaphylaxis due to food intake or insect stings, which can result in fatal outcome.

Allergenic molecules, represented by proteins available as purified natural compounds or recombinants, are immobilized as microspots (200 m in diameter) on a solid phase area of 7 x 10 mm and are grouped by sources and tissues and also on the basis of their biochemical structure and their IgE epitope sharing. It is thus possible to visualize the IgE cross-reactivity, now better- defined as IgE co-recognition, as a cluster of fluorescent spots. The extension of cluster IgE recognition can help clinical decision on whether an allergenic source must be avoided or not.shortcomings of the classical diag - nostic algorithm, which was solely based on allergenic extracts from nature, could be solved in terms of assay sensitivity, specificity and prediction of clinical severity and risk. Nowadays, several prominent examples exist, where the meas - urement of sIgE to molecular aller - gen components is a recommend - ed state-of-the-art procedure within the algorithm for clinical decision-making (T able 2). From a global perspective - de - spite the immense progress that has been achieved in the field of molecular allergy in vitro testing within the last two decades - there is a clinical and research need for a better reflection of allergenic molecules based on regional dif - ferences in the world. Not all aller - gens are global, some of them are regional, but still can cause severe allergic disease. This new era of allergy diagnosis, which calls for a global definition of allergenic source and molecules, has already been entered. The analysis of such wealth of data is now possible by using advanced information and communication technologies, which will ultimately result in bet - ter care for allergic patients.170GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION C - Allergy diagnosisTAblE 2 Molecular components or allergens with a demonstrated utility for clinical decision making in various allergic conditions Allergic DiseaseMolecular Component / AllergenDiagnostic Problem SolvedCountries of Major Studies Insect venom anaphylaxisApi m 1, Ves v 1, Ves v 5, Pol d 5Better differentiation of honey bee and vespid venom double-sensitized patientsGER, SUI, AUT, SLO, USA, ITA, POL, ESP Insect venom anaphylaxisVes v 5Increased sIgE assay with rVes v 5GER, SUI, AUT for food-/wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (F/WDEIA)JAP , FIN, DAN, GER, SUI Peanut allergy Ara h 2, Ara h 6Predictive marker allergens for severe reactions to ingested peanutUSA, GBR, GER, AUS Allergy to red meat -GalMarker allergen for delayed anaphylactic reactions to red meat and offalUSA, SWE, GER, AUT Pollen Allergy; Insect venom anaphylaxisCCDMarker for IgE-based cross-reactivity without clinical relevanceITA, NED, GER, AUT Insect venom anaphylaxisApi m 10, Api m 3Prediction of patients at risk for therapeutic failures in honey bee venom immunotherapyGER, SUI Abbreviations and explanations: Tri a bee venom allergens Phospholipase A2, Acid Phosphatase, Icarapin; Ves allergens Phospholipase A1, Antigen 5; Pol d 5, Polistes venom allergen Antigen 5; Ara h 2, 6, major peanut allergens storage protein allergens.TAblE 1 Comprehensive allergen databases providing free Database URl T arget/function WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Sub- Committeehttp://www.allergen.org/Responsible for maintaining and developing a unique, unambiguous and systematic nomenclature for allergenic proteins ALLERGOME http://www.allergome.org/A web site designed to supply information on allergenic molecules (allergens) for clinicians and researchers AllergenOnlinehttp://www.allergenonline. org/Provides access to a peer reviewed allergen list and sequence searchable database AllFamhttp://www.meduniwien. ac.at/allergens/allfam/The AllFam database is a resource for classifying allergens into protein families (based on the Allergome website) Abbreviations and explanations: WHO, World Health Organization; IUIS, International Union of Immunological Societies.

As any in vitro test, it has the advantage of quantifying the allergic response without any risk to the patient. The most common cellular test applied is basophil activation by allergen (BAT) (Figure 1). This is used when the patient history and specific IgE or skin tests are discordant, when there is no reli - able specific IgE or skin test, or if the patient history indicates that skin tests may elicit a systemic re - sponse. Determination of basophil sensitivity with serial dilutions of allergen can be used to meas - ure the point of inflection or half maximal allergen concentration as measure of allergic response. This is a more reproducible measure of allergic disease than provocation testing. Basophil sensitivity can be used to identify food allergens, the primary sensitizer amongst cross-reacting allergens or aller - gen preparations and to monitor progress of allergen immunother - apy and anti-IgE therapy (Figure 2). Basophil activation is measured as either histamine release or as upregulation of granule proteins to the cell surface in response Hans J\u00fcrgen Hoffmann Aarhus University Hospital Aarhus, DenmarkIN VITRO AllERGY DIAGNOSIS - CEllUlAR AllERGY TESTING 3c Key messages In vitro allergy diagnosis - cellular allergy testingto allergen exposure. The most common antigen to be measured on the surface of blood basophils, which are identified as CD193 or CD203c positive cells in whole blood is the tetraspannin, CD63. CD63 resides in the same vesicles as histamine in blood basophils and in tissue mast cells. For optimal performance, intro - duction of basophil activation including setting up the flow cy - tometer should be done in the context of the existing network of units offering this service. There is a strong movement toward stand - ardisation of measurement of ba - sophil activation by flow cytome -try, embodied amongst others by the EAACI-EuroBAT meetings and an EAACI T ask Force on this top - ic. Contribution to and complying with standardisation will enhance the quality of this recent diagnos - tic tool for allergy diagnosis. Type IV reactions to drugs can be severe and it is important to iden - tify the eliciting allergen in these patients. This is done with the lymphocyte transformation test, but increasingly also by Elispot and with flow cytometric tech - niques.

For example, measuring a specific IgE or urinary leukotriene E4 is important for diagnosis of atopic status or aspirin-sensitive asthma, respectively. Discovering novel biomarkers, as well as finding ap - propriate combinations with ex - isting biomarkers, is an important goal in allergy research aiming to improve diagnosis and treatment. \"Companion diagnostics\" , which can predict therapeutic efficacy, is now being widely recognized due the development of molecular targeted drugs against allergic dis - eases, particularly asthma. These drugs, mostly biologics, are expen - sive and are effective only for par - ticular types of patients. It is now thought that asthma is not a single disease, but a \"syndrome. \" Thus, it is important to classify asthma into several endotypes, based on their pathogenesis, and evaluate for which endotype, using the ap - propriate biomarkers each mo - lecular targeted drug is effective using the appropriate biomarkers. Although inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) provide beneficial effects for Kenji Izuhara Saga Medical School Saga, JapanbIOMARKERS fOR AllERGY DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT 4 Key messages Biomarkers for allergy diagnosis and treatmentmost asthma patients, 5-10% of patients are resistant or hypo-re - sponsive to ICS. Any biomarker in - dicating the cause of the resistance to ICS would be useful. Moreover, biomarkers that can predict asth - ma relapse upon steroid reduction would be also valuable. Eosino - philc airway inflammation is at least one factor associated with steroid responsiveness. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is con - sidered a surrogate biomarker for eosinophilic airway inflammation and is regarded as a biomarker for steroid responsiveness (Figure 1). Although still controversial, the ac - cumulated evidence has suggested that FeNO is useful for assessing control with ICS, predicting relapse upon ICS reduction, and estimating lung function. Periostin, a downstream molecule of IL -4 and/or IL -13, has emerged as a surrogate biomarker of type 2 inflammation and tissue remod - eling in bronchial asthma. It has been shown that serum perios - tin can predict the efficacy of an - ti-IL -13 antibody (lebrikizumab) and anti-IgE antibody (omalizum - ab), thus proving a prototype bi - omarker for the companion diag - nostic of allergic diseases (Figure 2). Moreover, high serum periostin is linked to hypo-responsiveness for ICS, particularly in late-onset eosinophilic asthma (Figure 3). In addition to periostin, sputum eo - sinophils are useful for estimating the of anti-IL -5 antibody (mepolizumab). 174GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION C - Allergy diagnosis Genetic biomarkers, such as the filaggrin gene for skin barrier dys - function or the glucocorticoid-in - duced transcript 1 gene for re - sponsiveness to steroid therapy, represent another avenue to be explored in allergy research.KEY REfERENCES 1.

Therefore, the economic impact of AR with significant di - rect and indirect costs should not be underestimated. The diagnosis of AR is based on the history of the patient with minimally 2 nasal symptoms, with consistent findings at anterior rhi - noscopy and positive skin prick test results or blood analysis for allergen-specific IgE. In AR, CD4+ T lymphocytes play a key role in the initiation and orchestration of the allergic immune response through the secretion of cytokines like IL - 4, IL -5, IL -10 and IL -13 (Figure 1). IL -4 is a cardinal cytokine in driv - ing the sensitization to allergens by inducing the IgE class switch in B lymphocytes. The cross-linking of allergens with allergen-specif - ic IgE on the surface of mast cells leads to a rapid release of pre - formed mediators like histamine causing the symptoms of the early nasal response , i.e. sneezing, rhi - norrhoea and nasal itching. Both histamine and tumor necrosis fac - tor alpha (TNF- ), as well as newly generated lipid mediators like leu -kotriene C4 and prostaglandin D2, contribute to the influx of inflam - matory cells like eosinophils, CD4+ cells and basophils. The influx of these cells characterizes the late allergic response with mainly nasal obstruction as presenting symptom. Both allergen-specific IgE as well as eosinophilic nasal inflammation are features of AR and distinguish AR from other forms of rhinitis like infectious rhinitis, hormonal rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa, rhinitis in el - and occupation - al rhinitis. Recently, re gulatory T lymphocytes have been shown to be critical in the maintenance of immune responses. Naturally oc - curring CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells and/or IL -10 producing Tr-1 cells suppress Th2 lymphocyte responses to allergens in health, whereas this inhibition is atten - uated in allergic conditions. Suc - cessful immunotherapy for Th2 mediated allergic conditions is as - sociated with the induction of IL - 10 and TGF- producing Tr-1 cells. Other forms of medical treatment aim at suppressing the allergic in - flammatory cascade. The major - ity of AR is well controlled with guideline-based treatment. Sever - al considerations need to be made in case of lack of control (Figure 2). The allergic immune response in - volves a nasal as well as systemic immune response .

CRS is broadly classified into two groups: CRS with nasal poly - posis (CRSwNP) and CRS without NP (CRSsNP). CRS is defined as inflammation of the nose and the paranasal sinuses for 12 weeks, without complete resolution of symptoms. In CRSwNP , nasal pol - yps accompany the CRS inflam - mation. Polyps can be divided in eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic (NE). NE polyps demonstrate glan - dular hypertrophy and dense col - lagen deposition. Recent data have demonstrated that CRS affects approximately 5-15% of the general population both in Europe and the USA. The prevalence of doctor-diagnosed CRS was 2-4%. NPs were more frequent in men (2.2 to 1), in the elderly (5% at 60 years of age and older) and in asth - matics. In the USA, the prevalence of NP was found to be 4.2% with a higher prevalence (6.7%) in the asthmatic patients. The preva - lence of CRS has been reported to be higher in smokers.CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS AND NASAl POl YPOSIS 2 Key messages Chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposisMechanisms involved in CRS w/ wo NP involve both Th2-type and Th1/Th17 type inflammation, B cell activation and local produc - tion of high IgE levels, superanti - gens and biofilm formation (T able 2 and Figure 1). Several disease endotypes were proposed (Figure 2). ECONOMIC COSTS Of CRSWNP CRSwNP has a high impact on quality of life. Indirect costs are related to episodes of illness, linked to missed workdays, dis - ability claims, and absenteeism. Indirect costs account for 40% of the total costs of rhinosinusitis. Missed worked days due to sinusi -tis was 12.5 million and restricted activity days was 58.7 million days. National health care costs in the US remain very high for CRS, at an estimated 8.6 billion dollar per year. In US the total cost of treat - ing a patient with CRS was $2609 per year; in Europe the direct costs of a patient treated in a uni - versity hospital for severe chronic rhinosinusitis was $1861/year.

It is the most common oc - ular allergic disorder affecting ap - proximately 25% of the population and is responsible for presentation to a number of doctors including general practitioners, allergists and ophthalmologists. The charac - teristic s of AC include ocular itch, tearing, redness, chemosis and lid oedema (Figure 1). Itch is consid - ered a hallmark symptom but may also be experienced in those with dry eye. Signs are usually more dramatic and obvious in those with SAC compared to those with PAC. Seasonal and perennial AC (SAC and PAC) are the most common forms and most frequently occur with nasal allergy. They are caused by a classic type 1 hypersensitivity reaction to common aeroallergens. SAC, accounting for approximately 80% of all ocular allergy cases, usu - ally has a more dramatic appear - ance and is more problematic than PAC. Triggers are those for season - al allergic rhinitis, typically, pollen from trees, grasses and weeds. PAC is similar to SAC, but is experienced year round. It is triggered by chron - ic exposure to aeroallergens such Constance H. Katelaris University of Western Sydney and Campbelltown Hospital Sydney, AustraliaOCUlAR AllERGY 3 Key messages Ocular allergyas house dust mite, animal dander and mould. In general, SAC and PAC are self limiting, depending on allergen exposure. Other forms of ocular allergy, namely vernal tis - junctivitis (AKC) are potentially sight-threatening disorders. They have a much more complex im - munopathophysiology. VKC is un - common, occurring in children and teenagers with a male predom - inance of 2:1. There is seasonal variation in severity although the condition is not directly caused by aeroallergen exposure and is more severe and prevalent in hot, dry climates. It usually runs a course spanning 2-10 years and is always eventually outgrown. Intense itch, marked photophobia and a ropey discharge are characteristic symptoms while physical exami - nation most often reveals upper lid swelling with cobblestoning of the superior palpebral conjuncti - va, when the lid is everted. Other signs include Trantas dots (com - posed of eosinophils and cellular debris; seen around the limbus), and in severe cases, corneal in -185GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION D - Major Allergic Diseases a b figure 1 a - tearing, redness, chemosis and lid oedema in allergic conjunctivitis; b - cobblestoning conjunctiva in from punctuate keratitis to shield ulcer formation which can be sight threatening. AKC is the chronic, bilateral, severe conjunctivitis as - sociated with atopic dermatitis. It develops in approximately 25% of the adult atopic dermatitis pop - ulation with skin signs preceding ocular inflammation and eyelid ec - zema a common accompaniment. Symptoms may be debilitating; subconjunctival scarring and dis - tortion of lid margins may occur; chronic conjunctival inflammation and tear film disturbance may lead to ulceration, scarring and vision loss. Of all AKC patients, about 5% develop cataract and are at risk of other complications such as kera - toconus, retinal detachment and herpetic ocular infection. Giant papillary cell conjunctivitis is a condition not seen as frequently these days. It is caused by chron - ic exposure to a foreign body and was most commonly seen with long term contact lens use but with modern daily lenses, this is much less frequently seen. It may be seen in those with ocular prostheses and ocular sutures. Dry eye syndrome results from decreased tear pro - duction or disruption to the tear film stability. It can be confused with allergy and can commonly co-exist with AC. It is worsened by the use of oral antihistamines. Reg - ular use of lubricants is a useful ad - ditional therapeutic option in these patients as they assist in removal of allergen and relieve symptoms simultaneously. Management strategies for all forms of AC begin with allergen identification, removal or mini - misation, then trials of non phar - macological therapy such as eye irrigation and lubrication and pharmacological therapy. Treat - ing the nasal component of aller - gic rhinoconjunctivitis can bring significant relief from the ocular symptoms but several specific oc - ular allergy treatments are also available. In general, topical anti - histamine preparations are much more effective than oral antihis - tamines which can exacerbate the dry eye component if taken regularly. A number of mast cell stabilising agents are available for those who experience frequent and distressing symptoms; these Ocular allergymust be commenced 1-2 weeks before the anticipated onset of the allergy season to give maxi - mum relief. They are often used in combination with symptomat - ic topical antihistamine therapy. Medications with multiple actions (mast cell stabilising and antihis - tamines) have become mainstay treatment for patients with more troublesome symptoms. T opical corticosteroids are an im - portant component of manage - ment of VKC and AKC, but their use must be monitored carefully by an ophthalmologist. T opical cy - closporin (Restasis) may be useful in those with a T cell driven chron- ic inflammation such as VKC and AKC, where it can be steroid spar - ing. Ocular allergy is most common - ly managed by the general prac - titioner, but a patient, who is non-responsive to standard ther - apy, or who has one of the com - plex, potentially sight-threatening disorders, or who requires topical corticosteroids needs to be re - ferred for specialist management.

In the current update of the Glob - al Initiative for Asthma, asthma is described as a heterogeneous dis - ease, usually characterized by air - way inflammation, and defined by the presence of respiratory symp - toms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation. It is a chronic respiratory disease that can affect 1 to 18% of the population with considerable variability among countries (Figure 1). The variation of symptoms over time is triggered by factors such as exercise, aller - gen exposure, weather, or viral respiratory infections. Symptoms and airflow limitation may resolve spontaneously or in response to medication, and may sometimes be absent for weeks or months at a time. Patients can experience ep - isodic flare-ups (exacerbations) of asthma that may be life-threaten - ing and carry a significant burden to patients and the community. While there are no confirmatory diagnostic tests, asthma can pres - ent in early childhood as respira - tory tract illnesses.

The common view of asthma have changed considerably during the last 50 years. From initially being regarded as primarily a bronchos - pastic disorder, the inflammatory part of the disease and lately the systemic inflammatory part has been increasingly recognized. The new view of asthma as a primarily a systemic inflammatory disor - der, will call for new management and treatment strategies, closely linked to Allergology and Clinical Immunology. fROM RElEASE Of bRONCHO- SPASM TO CONTROllING AIRWAY INflAMMATION During the last decade there has been several paradigm shifts in the understanding of the disease mechanisms in adult asthma. In the 60th -70th much focus was on the smooth muscle component and the systemic and inhaled bronchodilators were used both as maintenance therapy and dur - ing acute attacks. From late 70th a paradigm shift occurred from bronchodilation to anti-inflam -Leif Bjermer Lund University Lund, SwedenADUlT ASTHMA 5 Key messages Adult asthmamatory treatment mainly with inhaled corticosteroids. Asthma was regarded as a central airway, eosinophilic disorder and it was believed that proper anti-inflam - matory treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) can achieve asthma control, and in some cases, even could cure the disease. How - ever, it soon became clear that ICS treatment only controlled parts of the disease with a rapid relapse as soon as the ICS treatment was stopped. Even though corticos - teroids cover a wide range of the asthmatic inflammation, there are other steroid refractory mecha - nisms that in the long run induces tissue changes, i.e. airway remod - elling, resulting in persistent air - way hyper responsiveness and an accelerated lung function decline. Chronic asthmatic inflammation and tissue remodeling, thus repre - sents one of the major future chal - lenges in asthma management. THE IMPORTANCE Of SMAll AIRWAYS IN ASTHMA It is a well-recognized fact that a large fraction of patients treated with ICS do not achieve accept - able clinical control, even when bad adherence is corrected for. One probable explanation is that ICS do not cover all aspects of the asthmatic inflammation (different inflammatory endotypes). It has also been shown that these pa - tients have an increased, partially steroid resistant inflammation in the peripheral airways. The pe -189GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION D - Major Allergic Diseases ripheral small airways, usually referred to as the \"silent zone\" , provides less than 10 % of airway resistance but more than 90 % of the total volume. This may explain lung function measured as PEF or FEV relates poorly to important asthma outcomes, such as symp - toms, exacerbations and quality of life. In the clinical context, small airways are not that silent. Impor - tant features of the disease such as nocturnal or exercise induced symptoms, risk for asthma exac - erbations are all related to uncon - trolled inflammation in the small airways. fROM A lUNG DISEASE TO A SYSTEMIC INflAMMATORY DISORDER The traditional view of asthma has been organ centered, focusing on asthma as a pure lung disorder. However, in the real life setting, most of the patients with asthma have one or more co-morbidities interfering with the disease. More than 80% of patients with asthma have concomitant rhinitis or rhi - nosinusitis and this link becomes stronger by disease severity. Thus, with more severe uncontrolled disease, concomitant rhinitis/rhi - nosinusitis is almost always pres - ent. Unfortunately, this obvious fact has been ignored by the phar - maceutical companies developing asthma drugs, excluding the most common asthma phenotype, i.e. the asthma-rhinitis patient from clinical asthma trials. Not only the upper airways have a great impact on the asthma con - trol. It is well known that food allergen sensitization increases the risk for asthma development later on in life. Recent data also suggests a close link between skin barrier dysfunction, dermatitis and inflammation in the airways. Thus, not only the lungs, but also a reduced skin barrier may be an important entrance for allergic sensitization also to airborne al - lergens. A third important link with sys - temic inflammation and asthma is the neuroimmunologic network (Figure 1). Anxiety and depres - sion are more prevalent among patients with asthma and allergy. Moreover, the neuroendocrine re - sponse to biological stress affects several somatic functions includ - ing the airways and this will prob - ably be a very important research area in the near future.

It is commonly IgE-mediated, but can also occur through IgE- independent immune mechanisms or direct mast cell stimulation. Vulnerable patients with anaphylaxis include infants, adolescents, pregnant women, the elderly, patients with asthma, cardiovascular disease, mast cell activation disorders, and those concurrently taking certain medications. Amplifying co-fa ctors include exercise, infection, and emotional stress. Initial treatment focuses on prompt epinephrine (adrenaline) intramuscular injection in the mid-outer thigh, calling for help, positioning the patient supine, providing supplemental oxygen and intravenous fluids, and vigilant monitoring. Post-discharge management includes preparing the patient to treat recurrences in the community, and preventing recurrences by confirming the anaphylaxis trigger(s), and initiating al lergen avoidance and immune modulation.Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic or hypersensitivity reaction that can cause death. It is rapid in on - set (minutes to a few hours) and typically involves multiple body systems. The lifetime prevalence of anaphylaxis from all triggers is at least 1%. Patient factors and co-factors that affect anaphylaxis are similar worldwide (Figure 1). The importance of different ana - phylaxis triggers varies with age and geography. Anaphylaxis com - monly occurs through an IgE-de - pendent immunologic mechanism triggered by foods, stinging insect venoms, medications or latex. It can also be induced by other immunologic mechanisms or by direct mast cell stimulation. In id - iopathic anaphylaxis, the possibil - ity of a novel trigger or a mast cell activation disorder should be con - sidered (Figure 2). Clinical criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis have been validat - ed for use in medical settings and epidemiologic studies and have high sensitivity, good specifici - ty, and a high negative predictive value. Skin and mucous mem - brane symptoms and signs such as itching, flushing, hives, and an - gioedema are present in 80-90% of episodes. Respiratory, gastroin -F. Estelle R.

Initial management involves hav - ing a protocol, assessing the pa - tient, then promptly and simulta - neously calling for help, injecting epinephrine (adrenaline) intra - muscularly in the mid-outer thigh and positioning the patient supine or in a position of comfort. Sup - plemental oxygen, intravenous fluid resuscitation and cardiopul -monary resuscitation should be provided. Heart rate and function, blood pressure, and oxygenation should be monitored, if possible, H1-antihistamines, H2-antihista- mines, glucocorticoids, and beta-2 adrenergic agonists should not be administered before epinephrine treatment, or as monotherapy (Figure 4). Patients with anaphy - laxis refractory to epinephrine, supplemental oxygen, and intra - venous fluid resuscitation need in - tensive care treatment with venti - latory and inotropic support. 192GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION D - Major Allergic Diseases figure 1 Age-related factors, concomitant diseases, concurrent medications, and amplifying co-factors in anaphylaxis.

Preparedness is critically important. Treatment should be initiated as soon as anaphylaxis is recognized, as death can occur within minutes.

For prevention of recurrences, a patient who has been treated for anaphylaxis should be evaluated by an allergy/immunology special - ist who will confirm the trigger(s) by using skin tests, measurement of allergen-specific IgE levels, and other investigations as indicated. Skin tests are performed at least 3-4 weeks after the anaphylactic episode and if negative in a patient with a strong history of anaphylax - is, they should be repeated weeks or months later. Information about avoidance of relevant triggers should be provided. If applicable, immune modulation using allergen specific immunotherapy or drug desensitization protocols should be initiated. Co-morbidities such as asthma or cardiovascular disor - ders should be optimally managed (Figure 5). Anaphylaxis research is no longer hindered by the perception that the disease is rare, by absence of an acceptable definition, or by lack of validated diagnostic clin - ical criteria. A global agenda for anaphylaxis research has been de - veloped to improve understand - ing of epidemiology, patient risk factors, mechanisms and triggers, and optimal methods of diagnosis, management, and prevention.

The diagnostic work-up of DHRs is a step-wise approach, starting with an as exhaustive as possible clinical history, followed, when validated, by in vivo (skin and provocation) tests and in some rare cases by in vitro biological testsAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) resembling clinically to allergy are called drug hypersensitivity reac - tions (DHRs). They comprise 15% of all ADRs and affect more than 7 % of the general population. The term \"drug allergy\" is reserved to immunologically-mediated DHRs, after showing direct or indirect evidence of either drug-specific antibodies or T-cells. These reac - tions are mostly unpredictable. They can be life threatening, may require or prolong hospitalization and necessitate changes in sub - sequent therapy. They are of sig - nificant concern for clinicians and patients. Even though urticaria and macu - lopapular eruptions are the most frequent manifestations, there are many other clinical presenta - tions artificially classified into two types (Figure 1), according to the delay of onset of the reaction after the last administration of the drug: 1) Immediate reactions , occurring less than 1 hour after the last drug intake, usually in the form of isolat - ed urticaria, angioedema, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, broncho tro-intestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), or anaphylax - is with or without cardiovascular collapse (anaphylactic shock) and Pascal Demoly University Hospital of Montpellier Montpellier, FranceDRUG AllERGY 7 Key messages Drug allergy2) , with variable cutaneous symptoms oc - curring after more than 1 hour and up to several days after the last drug intake, such as late-occurring urticaria, maculopapular Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and generalized bullous fixed drug eruptions), drug reaction with eo - sinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute generalized exan - thematous (AGEP) and symmetrical drug-related inter -triginous and flexural exanthemas. Internal organs can be affected either alone or with cutaneous symptoms and include hepatitis, renal failure, pneumonitis, ane - mia, neutropenia, and thrombo - cytopenia. The first category is mostly mediated through specific IgE, whereas the latter is specific T cell-mediated. Both under-diagnosis (due to un - der-reporting) and over-diagnosis (due to an over-use of the term \"allergy\") are common. The diag - nostic work-up of DHRs is a step- wise approach, starting with an 198GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION D - Major Allergic Diseases as exhaustive as possible clinical history, followed, when validated for some drug classes, by in vivo (skin and provocation) tests and in some rare cases by in vitro biologi- cal tests. Several guidelines and consensus documents on general or speci- fic drug class-induced DHRs are available to support the diagno - sis. The recent International Con - sensus (ICON) on Drug Allergy synthesizes multiple guidelines into one generally approved and accepted consensus document. It provides guidance for firm diag - nosis and solutions to find alter - natives when the responsibility of the drug is confirmed (Figure 2). Only a thorough diagnostic work- up will allow a better classification of the reactions and provides pa - tients with more reliable infor - mation and recommendations for future treatments. A lot still needs to be done to understand better DHRs and diagnose severe cuta - neous reactions for which drug provocation tests are contraindi - cated and in the field of biological diagnosis.

The clinical presentation of food allergy involves a large spectrum of symptoms (T able 1), triggered by ingestion of food, sometimes in very small amounts or even by in - halation and skin contact. Although these symptoms are re - ported frequent in the population, if investigated appropriately often they are not caused by food allergy. In a recent systematic review, the point prevalence of self-reported food allergy was approximately six times higher than challenge-prov - en food allergy. The prevalence of fOOD AllERGY 8 Key messages Food allergyfood allergy was generally higher in children compared to adults. While the prevalence of primary food allergy appeared to be sta - ble over time, the prevalence of secondary food allergy caused by cross-reactions of food allergens with inhalant allergens appears to be increasing. A proper diagnosis is necessary for a sufficient and safe treatment. A careful diet history is fundamen - tal, since it can establish the likeli - hood of the diagnosis and identify the potential food triggers (T able 2).

So far, the only safe treatment is identification and avoidance of the offending food. Education of the patient, families, health care professionals and others in the network around the patient on how to avoid ingesting the food and how to recognize and manage allergic reactions is important. In addition, especially in young chil - dren a nutritional balanced diet should be ensured to compensate the exclusion of the culprit food. Several new strategies such as oral immunotherapy are currently being investigated, and may prove to be useful in the future. KEY REfERENCES 1.

The incidence of AD has increased by two- to three-fold during the past three decades in industrialized countries. AD affects up to 20 % of the children and 2 to 10 % of adults and has a deep impact on the qual - ity of life of patients and parents. The increasing prevalence may be linked to the Western lifestyle. AD generates a substantial econom - ic burden. The average costs for an AD patients in Germany have been estimated to a total of about 4400\u20ac (1450 \u20ac reimbursed direct costs, 1130\u20ac costs not reimbursed costs and 1850 indirect costs). Due to its complex pathophysiol - ogy, the natural history of AD is highly variable and may be deter - mined by a number of (epi)genetic as well as environmental factors including the recently identified microbiome (Figure 2).

It is characterized by the ap - pearance of fleeting wheals, each lasting 1-24 hours and/or an - gioedema lasting up to 72 hours. The key cell involved is the mast cell, which can be activated by a vast variety of stimuli. Activation of superficially situated mast cells in the skin gives rise to urticaria, whereas mast cells in dermis are involved in angioedema. Often both manifestations are present in the same patient. Histamine is the key mediator in urticaria and most cases of angioedema, where - as bradykinin is responsible for some types of angioedema (he - reditary angioedema and Angio - tensin- Converting-Enzyme (ACE) induced angioedema). It is estimated that up to 25% of adults will experience at least one episode of acute urticaria some - time in their lifetime, while only around 3% will develop chronic spontaneous urticaria (point prev - alence 0.6%).

International guidelines divide ur - ticaria in acute and chronic (with an arbitrary limit set at 6 weeks of duration) and in spontaneous forms (without a known underly - ing cause except autoantibodies directed against the receptor for IgE) and inducible forms (T ables 1 and 3). The diagnosis is easily made in typical cases, but a thorough med - ical history is critical both for cor - rect classification and for avoid - ance of extensive investigations for underlying disease. Normally, a test for autoimmune urticaria with autologous serum or via in vitro tests together with investigations for a chronic infection is sufficient. Urticaria can, however also be a feature of more severe diseases and should not be overlooked. The severity of the disease is assessed according to the score system pre - sented in T able 2. Since disease, severity is often fluctuating during the day, a 24-hour score is advised, T able 2. In the inducible forms, the treat - ment of choice (but not always possible) is avoidance.

All aspects of the disease were critically evaluated using the GRADE methodology: definition, clinical aspects, diagnostic work- up, assessment of disease activi - ty and impact, and management. Ideally, the diagnostic work up in chronic urticaria (CU) (Figure 1) reveals a cause that can be treat - ed, but frequently this is not possi - ble. Especially the inducible forms of CU are mainly idiopathic. It is strongly advised to search for un - derlying causes in chronic spon - taneous urticaria only in patients with longstanding and/or severe disease and to perform extended diagnostic testing based on the patient history.Aiming for complete symptom con - trol in urticaria as safely as possible is recommended. Treatment with non sedating H1-antihistamines is the first line option (safety data are available for their use for sev - eral years continuously). Continu - ous use is superior to on demand use, as antihistamines block the development of new wheals and angioedema, but do not help to decrease the time to resolution of already existing ones. It is recommended not to use old - er first generation antihistamines, because they have pronounced adverse events.

Massimo University of Salerno Salerno, ItalyANGIOEDEMA 12 Key messages AngioedemaAngioedema is becoming a very frequent clinical emergency and it is the second cause of hospital - ization after asthma as an allergic disorder. The current classifica - tion of angioedema identifies both hereditary and acquired forms of the disease. Hereditary angioede - ma (HAE) is due to deficiency of C1 inhibitor (C1INH) a plasma protein that controls activation of the kinin system, the complement pathway and coagulation (Figure 2). Deficiency of C1INH leads to uncontrolled generation of brad -ykinin, a potent vasoactive medi - ator that is responsible for HAE attacks. Rare forms of HAE with normal C1INH have been associ - ated with activating mutations of Factor XII, the trigger of the brad - ykinin cascade. Acquired forms of angioedema include those as - sociated with allergic reactions, mostly induced by drugs, food or hymenoptera stings. These forms of allergic angioedema are due to vasoactive mediators such as histamine, prostaglandins, leu - kotrienes and platelet activating figure 1 A typical angiodema of the lips in a child with hereditary angioedema.213GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION D - Major Allergic Diseases angioedema due to C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency. Arrows indicate the biochemical steps controlled by C1-INH in the complement cascade, the kinin pathway and the fibrinolytic system. The generation of activated Factor XII (Factor XIIa), induced by local trauma, results in the conversion of prekallicrein into the active enzymatic form of kallicrein. This enzyme acts on high molecular weight kininogen (HMK) and generates bradykinin, a small peptide that induces angioedema by interacting with specific B2 receptors (bradykinin B2-R) expressed on endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of small vessels. factor (PAF) released by activat - ed mast cells. Two other variants of acquired angioedema are me - diated by bradykinin and include those due to an acquired deficien - cy of C1INH, frequently associ - ated with hematologic tumors, and angioedema induced by ACE inhibitors. ACE is a key enzyme responsible for bradykinin inacti - vation and its blockade by ACE in - hibitors, a commonly used class of antihypertensive agents, may trig - ger acute attacks of angioedema in genetically predisposed individ - uals. In many patients, however, the cause of angioedema remains unknown and they are defined as having \"idiopathic\" angioedema. Idiopathic angioedema - minergic depending on whether antihistamines prevent it. Regardless of its cause and wheth - er hereditary or acquired, an - gioedema is clinically character - ized by recurrent swelling of the face (mostly eyelids and lips), neck, upper or lower extremities and ex - ternal genitals. Mucosal angioede - ma is most frequently localized to the mouth (tongue and uvula), the gastrointestinal tract, with severe abdominal pain resembling an acute abdomen syndrome, or to upper respiratory tract. Laryngeal angioedema is the most severe lo - cation and may lead to death if not treated rapidly and appropriately. Even though allergic angioedema and angioedema due to C1INH deficiency have similar clinical features, their treatment is re -markably different. Attacks of allergic angioedema usually re - spond to antihistamines, gluco - corticoids and epinephrine (if part of anaphylaxis), whereas those due to C1INH deficiency require treatment with C1 inhibitor (re - placement therapy), ecallantide (a kallicrein icatibant, a bradikinin B2 receptor antago - nist.

Angioedema215GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION D - Major Allergic Diseases Allergic contact dermatitis is a T-cell mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction in the skin, with skin-infiltrati ng, CD3+ CD4+ T helper cells The clinical features depend on the type of responsible allergens: usually, dermatitis occurs at the site of allergen application, but spreading of the dermatitis is possible A good history and patch testing are the mainstays for diagnosis The management consists of the elimination or the reduction of contact allergens and the use of a topical steroid or of a topical calcineurin inhibitor Up to 70% of patients sensitized to wide-spread allergens will have some degree of chronic dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a typical manifestion a T-cell mediated, delayed-type hyper - sensitivity reaction in the skin. Most allergens in allergic contact dermatitis are so-called haptens of low molecular weight and need to link with proteins (carriers) in the skin, before they become an - tigenic. ACD is not related to ato - py, however, patients with atopic dermatitis develop epicutaneous sensitizations more frequently as compared to non-atopic individ - uals, probably due to the related barrier defect of the skin. CD3+ CD4+ T helper are the ma - jor skin-infiltrating cells. The role of skin-infiltrating CD8+ T cells is not clear yet, but a subpopulation of these cells may function as sup - pressor cells, which dampen down the reaction. Spontaneous reso - lution occurs after the antigen is removed and the T-cell mediators disappear. A number of cells (e.g. na\u00efve or induced Tregs) and mol - ecules (e.g. IL -10, prostaglandin E) are involved in the downregula - tion of the inflammatory response. The clinical features of ACD de - pend on the type of responsible al - lergens. Usually, dermatitis occurs at the site of allergen application, but spreading of the dermatitis is Thomas Werfel Hannover Medical School Hannover, GermanyAllERGIC CONTACT DERMATITIS 13 Key messages Allergic contact dermatitispossible (Figure 1a and b). Contact dermatitis caused by an airborne material may be difficult to iden - tify, but this can occur (e.g. with plants or volatile preservatives in wall colors). If a contact allergen is ingested or inhaled it can rare - ly lead to hematogenous allergic contact dermatitis. Worldwide, nickel sulfate is the leading cause of ACD. Women present more commonly than men with ACD, and there is an increase in incidence with advancing age. A good history and patch testing (Figure 2) are the mainstays in the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis. In taking the patient's history, it is important to consider occupational, household, and rec - reational exposure to possible al - lergens. Once there is a suspicion of ACD, patch testing is indicated. The European baseline series from the European Society of Contact Dermatitis is a recommendation of a minimum set of allergens to which European patients should be tested (http://www.escd.org/ aims/standard_series/). These can be adapted to regional occurenc - es of contact allergens and can be monitored to estimate incidence of contact sensitzations to indi - viduals allergens. According to the history, a more extensive allergen set shall be applied, if ACD is sus - pected. 216GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION D - Major Allergic Diseases The management of all types of suspected ACD consists of the elimination or the reduction of contact allergens and the use of a topical steroid or - particularly in sensitive areas (face, intertrig - inous sites) - a topical calcineurin inhibitor to return the skin to a normal state. Allergen avoidance can be simple or virtually impossi - ble at other times. Unfortunately, up to 70% of patients sensitized to wide-spread allergens will still have some degree of dermatitis after some years. Physicians who perform patch testing must be able to commu - nicate to the patient materials, which may contain offending aller - gens. The identification of a causa - tive occupational contact allergen, which may be avoided thereaf - ter can help to keep a patient at a workplace. It is recommended that the patient gets an 'allergy passport' with information about identified allergens. KEY REfERENCES 1. Mortz CG, Andersen KE.

The presentation of IgE-mediated Type I latex aller - gy ranges from mild itching and erythema at the site of skin or mu- cosal contact, localised urticaria (Figure 1) to anaphylaxis. This di - verse spectrum of reactions has been referred to as the contact urticaria syndrome.

Developing allergic contact der - matitis to chemicals used in the manufacture of rubber products (type IV hypersensitivity), includ - ing rubber accelerators, and the risk of irritant contact dermatitis through prolonged glove wearing remains a problem in some occu - pations, including dentistry, hair - dressing, mechanics and manufac - turing industry. Natural rubber latex is harvest - ed from the rubber tree, Hevea braziliensis , which is indigenous to the Amazon region, but mainly cultivated in Malaysia and Thai - land. Latex forms the cytoplasm of specialized cells called lacticifers that function to seal damaged sites. It contains water, rubber (cis-1,4-polyisoprene), protein, resins, sugars, ash and sterol gly - cosides. In adult latex allergic patients, pro - hevein (Hev b 6.01), hevein (Hev b 6.02), rubber elongation factor (Hev b 1) and Hev b 5 are impor - tant allergens. In children with spi - na bifida or those with a history of multiple operations, Hev b 1 and rubber elongation factor homo - logue (Hev b 3) are important. Hev b 8, on the other hand is a profilin with high cross-reactivity to many species of tree (including silver birch), grass, vegetable and some fruits (the latex-fruit syndrome). IgE against Hev b 8 was the com - monest mono-sensitisation on microarray in a series of 41 pa - tients with elevated specific latex IgE, but only one of them showed symptoms, illustrating that clinical latex allergy depends on the sen - sitization profile to the different latex proteins in rubber.

Immunologic tests should be performed to identify sensitization to specific occupationa l allergens Environmental control is crucial for prevention, and every effort should be made to keep the workplace without an exposure hazardOccupational allergy refers to those disorders or conditions that are caused by exposure to sub - stances in the work environment and in whose pathogenesis aller - gic factors are determinant. The allergic diseases that may be con - tracted as a consequence of expo - sure to sensitizing agents in the workplace are rhinitis, contact urticaria and occupational anaphylaxis. When these disorders are not caused by occupational exposures, but are aggravated in the workplace the term work-exacerbated is used. Workplace agents are complex mixtures of specific and non-spe - cific components (Figure 1). Sen - sitization precedes the develop - ment of allergic symptoms, which may follow the pattern of an \"oc - cupational allergic march\" (Figure 2). Occupational rhinitis is an in - flammatory disease of the nose, characterized by intermittent or persistent nasal symptoms, and/ or variable nasal airflow limita - tion and/or hypersecretion due to causes and conditions attributable to a particular work environment Santiago Quirce Hospital La Paz Institute for Health Research (IdiPAZ) Madrid, SpainOCCUPATIONAl AllERGY 16 Key messages Occupational allergyand not to stimuli encountered outside the workplace. Occupational asthma (OA) re - fers to de novo asthma or the re - currence of previously quiescent asthma induced by either sensiti - zation to a specific substance (eg, an inhaled protein or a chemical at work), which is termed allergic or sensitizer-induced OA, or by expo - sure to an inhaled irritant at work, which is termed irritant-induced OA (Figure 3). Approximately 372 different causes of allergic OA have been identified. These agents are categorized into high-molec - ular-weight (HMW) compounds, which are proteins acting through an IgE-mediated mechanism, and low-molecular-weight (LMW) compounds, which are chemical sensitizers that, with few excep - tions, are not associated with an IgE-dependent mechanism. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an allergic lung disease that occurs as the result of an immu - nologic inflammatory reaction to the inhalation of any of a variety of organic dusts or LMW chemicals 222GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION D - Major Allergic Diseases with or without systemic manifes - tations. The disease is a diffuse, predominantly mononuclear in - flammation of the lung parenchy - ma, particularly the terminal bron - chioles, interstitium, and alveoli. There is a wide variety of agents that can cause the disease, most of which are present in the work - place. Pathogenic mechanisms of OA and HP are summarized in Fig - ure 4. Occupational allergic contact dermatitis is one of the most com- mon occupational diseases. Mak - ing a timely and accurate diagno - sis is important to improving the outcome. T aking a work history and patch testing are essential el - ements in the diagnostic process.

Originally no striking absorptive or immunologic func - tions were attributed to this organ. In the mid-1990s, two case series described patients suffering from dysphagia accompanied by a prom - inent eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus. Eosinophilic esophagi - tis (EoE) was recognized as its own entity in the medical literature. MOlECUlAR AND ClINICAl CHARACTERISTICS EoE represents a Th2-type inflam - matory disease with IL -5, IL -13 and eotaxin as key mediators and eosinophils, T cells and basophils as critical cells involved. Remode - ling of the esophagus is a hallmark of EoE, leading to esophageal dysfunction and bolus impaction. Familial occurrence, an inflamma - tion-dependent genetic signature together with a genetic abnormal - ity in the eotaxin 3 genes under - score the influence of genetics in this disease. EoE may affect individuals at any age, though the clinical presenta - tion is highly age-dependent. Whereas children show a wide spectrum of symptoms, including chest pain, feeding problems and failure to thrive, adults present with a rather narrow spectrum, specifically, dysphagia for solids up to food impaction. There is a significant allergic bias in the EoE population, with more than 70% of patients having con - current allergic rhinitis, asthma, eczema and/or a history of atopy. Of note, in children, EoE seems to be primarily a food antigen driven disease, whereas in adults, main - ly aeroallergen sensitization has been observed. ENDOSCOPICAl AND HISTOlOGICAl fEATURES Endoscopy reveals some typical signs, such as edema with loss of vascular pattern, longitudinal fur - rows and white exudates in the acute inflammatory stage (Figure 1), and strictures and rings, lead - ing to a rigid and narrow esopha - gus in the fibrotic stage (Figure 2). Histopathologic key feature of EoE is a characteristic prominent eosinophil infiltration (Figure 3), refractory to treatment with pro - ton-pomp inhibitors. TREATMENT Treatment modalities for EoE in - clude the 3D's: Drugs, mainly top - ical corticosteroids and biologic agents, Diet, and Dilation. Due to their convincing efficacy with response rates of approximately 70% swallowed topical corticos - teroids are considered as first line drugs, whereas biologicals or im - munosuppressant's are used only for refractory disease.

FPIES is characterized by repeti - tive vomiting that begins approx - imately 2 hours following food ingestion, and often progresses to lethargy, diarrhea and additional signs and symptoms suggesting a systemic reaction distinct from IgE-mediated anaphylaxis (e.g., lacking urticaria or obstructive respiratory symptoms). In severe cases (about 15%) hypothermia, methemoglobinemia, acidemia, and or hypotension/shock may develop. Laboratory findings typ - ically reveal elevated white blood cells with neutrophilia, and may include thrombocytosis. In young infants, the presentation often mimics sepsis. Manifestations of FPIES vary de - pending on the exposure to the offending food and may be acute of not of chronic (T able 1). The ap - pearance of acute symptoms fol - lowing a period of food avoidance is the feature that distinguishes FPIES from other gastrointestinal food allergy disorders, such as en - teropathy, eosinophilic gastroen - teritis, or celiac disease.

The most common single food al - lergens in FPIES are cow's milk (CM), soy and rice. Solid foods including cereal proteins such as rice and oat, egg, fish, vegetables, and poultry have been reported in children, whereas shellfish and mollusks have been reported in adults. The prevalence of FPIES is un - known.

Antigen-specific T cells and imbalance between TGF- and IFN- that affects intestinal barrier permeability may play a role. Systemic food-specific IgE antibodies are typically absent in FPIES. Diagnosis of FPIES relies on recog - nition of a constellation of symp - toms and an oral food challenge (OFC) (T able 1 and 2).

Resolution of FPIES varies wide - ly among reports from different countries. The Israeli birth cohort showed 90% resolution of CM- FPIES by age 3 years, whereas experience from allergy referral populations in the U.S. showed 60% resolution by age 3 years. Sicherer et al.observed that chil - dren with detectable food-specific IgE tend to have a more protracted course and are at risk of develop - ing IgE-mediated immediate-type symptoms. Therefore, including SPT and/or measurement of se - rum food-specific IgE levels in the initial as well as follow-up eval -uations is prudent to determine timing and the type of oral food challenges. Further research should focus on the pathophysiology and natural history of FPIES, as well as the unique diagnostic tools for initial diagnosis and monitoring of toler - ance development.

Reported triggers include natu - rally derived and artificial food or drug additives including colour - ings, flavourings and preservatives, but also other ingredients such as lactose and artificial sweeteners. Patient-reported rates of food intolerance range from 7 to over 20%. The reported rate is 6 to 10 times greater than the prevalence determined through double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). Approximately 1 to 2% of the population may have non-al - lergic food hypersensitivity. Drug intolerance due to additives has been rarely reported in the liter - ature, but there are no controlled prospective studies on its preva - lence. Immune reactions are usually me - diated through non-IgE mediated mast cell degranulation (Figure 1). Non-immune reactions might be derived due to: 1.

The Southampton Study published in 2007 reported a small, but statisti - cally significant increase in hyper - activity levels with additives com - pared to placebo, but the effect was not consisted across both age groups and the overall effect did not reach statistical significance. In summary, there is not enough consistent data to confirm a role of food colourings in hyperactive behaviours.

In patients developing large lo - cal reactions (suspicion of Arthus reaction) measurement of serum vaccine-specific antibodies can be useful for the decision to with - hold additional dose. In patients developing eczema or persis - tent nodules, patch tests can be performed to diagnose delayed hypersensitivity to vaccine pre - servative or adjuvant. However, a positive patch test should not be considered as a contraindication for booster injection.ADVERSE REACTIONS TO VACCINES fOR INfECTIOUS DISEASES 4 Key messages Adverse reactions to vaccines for infectious diseasesSYSTEMIC REACTIONS TO VACCINES The most common systemic re - actions include maculopapular or delayed urticarial skin rashes. These reactions do not contrain - dicate further vaccine administra - tion, as they are believed to result from a non-specific activation of the immune system. Real IgE-mediated allergies to vac - cine are extremely rare, but their identification is important due to the potential life-threatening risk. Systematic approaches have been proposed to optimally manage pa - tients with a suspicion of vaccine hypersensitivity (Figure 1). In patients with a history of al - lergy to one of the vaccine con - stituents (i.e. egg, gelatin, yeast, formaldehyde, antibiotics and latex), who have not received the vaccine before, a complete allergic work-up is recommend - ed (i.e. skin tests, specific IgE measurement and/or a provo - cation test) to confirm an aller - gy. If this is the case, skin test with the vaccine itself should be performed. If positive, the vaccine can still be adminis - tered using adapted protocols. Regarding administration of in - fluenza vaccine in patients with severe egg allergy, it has been shown that the vaccine can be Jean-Christoph Caubet University Hospitals of Geneva Geneva, SwitzerlandIngrid T erreehorst Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, The Netherlands235GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION E - Other hypersensitivity diseases administered safely with some precautions. Skin test to the in - fluenza vaccine before vaccina - tion is no longer recommended. In patients with a history of sys - temic reactions to vaccine, the allergic workup should include testing of the vaccine itself as well as its components. In case of a positive test to one of the components, one can consider a vaccine not containing that component, if available. If the patient is positive to the vac - cine, a risk-benefit assessment should be performed; the physi -cian should determine whether subsequent doses of the sus - pected vaccine are necessary. Measurement of vaccines an - tibodies to determine whether they are at protective levels helps determining whether booster injection can be with - held. KEY REfERENCES 1.

Glucocorticosteroids and antimycotics are the mainstay of treatment. Allergen avoidance is crucial to prevent progressionAllergic bronchopulmonary my - coses are rare pulmonary hyper - sensitivity reaction , most com - monly directed against Aspergillus fumigatus (Allergic Bronchopul - monary Aspergillosis - ABPA). Many other fungi can also serve as antigen source, hence the term al - lergic bronchopulmonary mycosis. ABPA occurs on the background of either allergic asthma or cystic fibrosis. The disease occurs main - ly sporadic, but familial clustering has been reported. The pathogen - esis of ABPA involves complex lo - cal as well as systemic hypersensi - tivity reactions to fungal antigens from fungal mycelia, which grow in the bronchial lumen, where they cause local inflammation and subsequent tissue destruction re - sulting in central bronchiectasis. In addition to a marked cellular inflammation with eosinophils and neutrophils there is a humor - al component involving polyclon - al IgE-, IgG- and IgA production. Consequently, the complex immu - nopathogenesis of ABPA appears to involve type I as well as type III immune reactions. Comorbidities such as allergic rhinitis are fre - quent. Symptoms include wheezing, cough, malaise, fever, chest pain J. Christian virchow Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Rostock the production of copious amounts of purulent sputum, which often contains fungal hy - phae. Radiological features of ABPA are central bronchiecta - sis and fleeting pulmonary infil - trates, which do not respond to antibiotic therapy but to systemic corticosteroids instead. Most pa - tients have a considerable airflow obstruction, often combined with loss of lung volume due to pulmo - nary destruction by infiltrates and bronchiectasis and require high dose bronchodilator therapy in addition to anti-inflammatory glu - cocorticosteroids. The diagnosis of ABPA (T able 1) is difficult and there is a considera - ble lag time between first occur - rence of symptoms and diagnosis, often lasting many years.

ABPA has been classified in different stages (table 2) Treatment of ABPA requires con - siderable experience and a spe - cialist environment. Treatment aims are to prevent exacerbations by reducing endo-bronchial in - flammation to avoid progressive and eventually fatal loss of lung tissue. Glucocorticosteroids and antimycotics, both with a consid - erable potential for side-effects, are the central pillars of treat - ment. There are occasional case reports of successful treatment of ABPA with Omalizumab. Many patients in stage IV require main - tenance treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Allergen avoidance at home or workplace are crucial to prevent progression. Treatment in high al - titude such as Davos, Switzerland improves symptoms and reduces inflammation, most likely due to the low antigen content in these special environments. Prognosis is highly dependent on an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Therefore, pneumo - logic experience and a compre - hensive clinical, immunologic and radiologic workup are necessary to identify patients with this debil - itating disease. Treatment should be directed at the early identifica - tion of exacerbations to avoid the development of fatal pulmonary destruction. KEY REfERENCES 1. Virchow JC.

Skewing toward a Th2 phenotype is reported for chronic HP Phenotypic expression and severity depends on environmental and/or host genetic and immune co-factors The wide spectrum of causative antigens is continuously updated with new sources of airborne organic particles and drug-induced HP The diagnosis requires a detailed history, measurement of environmental exposure, pulmonary function tests, imaging, detection of serum specific antibodies, broncho-alveolar l avage, antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, environmental or laboratory-controlled inhalation challenge and lung biopsy Complete antigen avoidance is the best therapeutic measure, although very difficult to achieve in some cases. Systemic steroids are of value for subacute and chronic forms of HP, but do not influence long-term outcome. Manipulation of the immune response holds future promiseHypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an interstitial lung disease due to a combined type III and IV reaction with a granulomatous inflammation. The current view is that HP is caused by cytotoxic delayed hypersensitivity lympho - cytes, in a Th1/Th17 milieu (Figure 1). Both TLRs 2 and 9 contribute to the Th17 response and neutrophil recruitment. Additional mediators and pattern recognition receptors are involved in granuloma for - mation. Loss of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) control over the immune response is essential for the im - paired immune tolerance in HP . The mechanisms of progression to a chronic form remain unclear. For chronic HP a skewing toward a Th2 phenotype facilitated by group 2 innate lymphoid cells was described. Although many individuals are ex - posed to environmental antigens known to induce HP only 5-15% develop the disease. The pheno - typic expression of the disease depends on environmental co-fac - tors, such as viruses and/or host genetic and immune co-factors, which also promote considerable variability in disease severity and response to treatment. HP can occur in an occupational Ioana Agache Transylvania University Brasov, RomaniaHYPERSENSIVITY PNEUMONITIS 6 Key messages Hypersensivity pneumonitissetting or after home exposure, following inhalation of organic antigens (mammalian and avian proteins, fungi, bacteria), low-mo - lecular-weight chemicals or My - cobacterium avium-intracellulare complex organisms. As a non-in - halant variant HP can appear as a manifestation of drug-induced lung disease. Most recent re -ported drugs inducing HP are im - mune modulators used to treat neoplastic and connective tissue diseases or transplant recipients. New sources of airborne organ - ic particles are continually being recognized, such as the throm - bone player, Chacinero's lung, HP associated with catechin-rich green tea extracts, use of ultra -240GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION E - Other hypersensitivity diseases sonic misting fountains at home, Shiitake mushroom spores, mos - quito-coil smoke, medium-density fiberboard or cash handling. There is no single diagnostic single procedure or biomarker to confirm the diagnosis of HP . The diagnosis requires a detailed and careful history that would include social, environmental, and occupational status, measurement of environ - mental exposure, pulmonary func - tion tests, imaging, detection of serum specific antibodies, - of or laboratory-controlled inhalation challenge with the sus - pected antigen and lung biopsy. A sentinel case should prompt to the identification of exposed subjects, who might develop the disease. Improvement of symptoms away from exposure and/or a rapid re - sponse to oral steroids should heighten the awareness of HP . For monitoring HP activity meas - urement of alveolar NO following re-exposure and of biomarkers reflecting the lung injury/regen - eration (KL -6) and surfactant protein D are proposed. Complete antigen avoidance is the essential step in the management of HP . The majority of cases im - proves or heals, but some evolve to a chronic form probably due to persistence of exposure at an undetectable level in association with genetic and immunologic factors. Systemic corticosteroids are recommended for subacute and chronic forms of HP , although they do not influence long-term outcome. For progressive chronic HP immunosuppressants may be necessary (Figure 2). Modulation of the immune re - sponse holds future promise for treatment.

DIAGNOSIS AND ClASSIfICATION The diagnosis of systemic masto - cytosis (SM) is established on the basis of a bone marrow biopsy and smear, flow cytometry, mutational analysis of KIT, and serum tryptase (T able1). The classification of vari - ants of mastocytosis is shown in T able 2. The most frequent form of masto - cytosis is indolent systemic mas - tocytosis (ISM), which tends to fol - low a benign course. In contrast, aggressive forms of mastocytosis, including SM with an associated hematologic non-mast-cell-lin - eage disease (SM-AHNMD), ag - gressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), and mast cell leukemia (MCL), may lead to disability or even death. Dean D. Metcalfe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Bethesda, USAMASTOCYTOSIS 7 Key messages MastocytosisClINICAl fEATURES Of DISEASE Two-thirds of all cases of masto - cytosis present in childhood, with a second peak of onset in the late third to early fourth decade. The disease occurs in both males and females with roughly equal fre - quency. Cases of mast cell dis - ease diagnosed in childhood often resolve by adulthood, whereas adult-onset mastocytosis usually persists. Although there are cases of familial cutaneous mastocyto - sis, most patients report no fami - ly history. IgE-mediated allergy is not increased. Clinical symptoms follow patterns of organ system involvement, which includes the skin (Figure 1), gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Episodes of flushing and life-threatening episodic hypoten - sion may occur and are sometimes related to alcohol ingestion, insect stings, infection, certain medica - tions, and radio -contrast mate - rials. In patients with aggressive disease, fatigue and musculoskel - etal pain are frequent and may be accompanied by weight loss, fever and sweats. Chronic symptoms in - clude headache, decreased atten - tion span, irritability and depres - sion.

Systemic Mastocytosis (SM)The diagnosis of SM is made if one major and one minor criterion are present, or, if three minor criteria are met. Major CriterionMultifocal, dense infiltrates of mast cells (15 or more in aggregates) detected in sections of bone marrow and/or another extracutaneous organ, and confirmed by tryptase immunohistochemistry or other special stains. Minor Criteria In biopsy sections of bone marrow or other extracutaneous organs, more than 25% of the mast cells in the infiltrate are spindle-shaped or have atypical morphology, or, of all mast cells in bone marrow aspirates smears, more than 25% are immature or atypical mast cells. Detection of an activating point mutation at codon 816 of KIT in bone marrow, blood or another extracutaneous organ. Mast cells in bone marrow, blood or another extracutaneous organ express CD117 with CD2 and/or CD25. Serum total tryptase persistently greater than 20 ng/ml in the absence of an associated clonal myeloid disorder. mastocytosis (ISM)Smoldering SM Isolated marrow mastocytosis Systemic mastocytosis AllERGYSECTION E - Other hypersensitivity diseases followed by diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Mild hepatomeg - aly is often seen in patients with long-standing SM, and may be accompanied by mildly elevated levels of liver enzymes. Aggressive forms of mastocytosis are associ - ated with liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, ascites, and portal hypertension. Splenomegaly is observed in sys - temic disease. Bone pathology ranges from osteoporosis to oste - osclerosis. Cytopenias including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutro - are in aggressive forms of SM. Neutrophilia, mono - cytosis, and eosinophilia are also observed. Central and peripheral lymphadenopathy may occur. MANAGEMENT In adults, ISM tends to remain relatively stable or evolve slow - ly. Transformation from ISM into more aggressive forms of disease is unusual. Aggressive forms of disease, such as SM-AHNMD, of - ten progress and may require in -terventional therapy directed at decreasing the mast cell burden and treating the associated hema - tologic disease. Treatment of those with mas - tocytosis begins with symptom management with anti-mediator therapy. In most patients, symp - toms are controlled using such drugs. If not controlled use of glu - cocorticoids may be considered. For those with skin disease, man - agement includes good skin care, with preservation of moisture within the skin. Mastocytosis can be associated with spontaneous hypotension associated with an episode of mediator release (ana - phylactic shock), which is managed in the same way as anaphylaxis in allergic patients without masto - cytosis. Cytoreductive therapies including KIT-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors are reserved for the treatment of those with ASM, MCL, and SM-AHNMD. Referral to a center with expertise in man - aging rare forms of disease may be desirable.KEY REfERENCES 1. Horny HP , Metcalfe DD, Bennett JM et al, eds.

Vasculitis is defined by blood ves - sel damage and the presence of inflammatory leukocytes in vessel walls. Vasculitides are categorized by the size of the blood vessels af - fected, i.e. small, medium and large vessel vasculitis. HV is a small ves - sel vasculitis. ClINICAl PICTURE, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT HV is typically caused by drugs (most commonly antibiotics such HYPERSENSITIVITY VASCUlITIS (e.g. hepatitis B or C virus, parvovirus 19) or bacterial (e.g. streptococcal). HV signs and symptoms (palpable purpura and maculo-papular rash, figure 1) usually begin 7 to 10 days after the use of eliciting drugs or responsible infections. This peri - od may be shorter with repeated antigen exposure. Acute HV usu - ally resolves when the antigen is cleared, which is not always possi - ble. Especially chronic hepatitis B or C virus infections can be asso - ciated with a more chronic course. HV is diagnosed based on the typ - ical clinical findings, the history (drug or infection) and a skin biop - sy, showing leukocytoclastic vas -culitis and perivascular immune complexes that lack IgA. Patients should be tested for serum com - plement levels, markers of inflam - mation (ESR/CRP), and cryoglobu- lins. HV is defined by the American College of Rheumatology criteria (T able 1). These criteria, how - ever, do not reliably distinguish HV from IgA vasculitis (formerly called Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpu - ra). IgA vasculitis and HV are both immune complex-mediated, but IgA vasculitis shows internal or - gan involvement, whereas HV is, in almost all cases, limited to the skin. The treatment of HV is the discon - tinuation of the provoking drug or antigen, which usually leads to the resolution of the signs and symp - toms within a few days to weeks, Marcus Maurer T orsten Zuberbier Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Germany TAblE 1 American College of Rheumatol - ogy diagnostic criteria for hyper - sensitivity vasculitis 1. age >16 years, 2. use of a possible offending drug in temporal relation to the symptoms, 3. palpable purpura (figure 1), 4. maculopapular rash, 5. biopsy of a skin lesion showing neutrophils around an arteriole or venule. 246GlObAl AllERGYSECTION E - Other hypersensitivity diseases Hypersensitivity vasculitisbut some cases remain idiopathic and become chronic.

Over 200 genetic ab - normalities that lead to a variety of PID have been identified. Ap - proximately 250,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with PID, but according to estimates of the National Institutes of Health over 250,000 people are under diagnosed. In order to estimate the prevalence of PID in Europe as well as to establish and evaluate harmonized guidelines for the di - agnosis and treatment of PID, the European Society for Immunode - ficiencies (ESID) has developed an internet-based database for clini - cal and research data on patients with PID (T able 1). About 55% of the PID are humoral or B-cell abnormalities, 25% are T-cell or combined T and B-cell im - mune deficiencies, 25% are phago and <10% are complement deficien - cies (Figure 1). The most severe type of PID is lack of immune system at birth, e.g. absent T and B-cells (Severe combined immunodeficiency or SCID). SCID infants often die in the first year of life. Intervention with a bone marrow hematopoie - tic stem cell transplant is curative. Recent data shows that the prog - nosis of these infants is better if the diagnosis is made before 3 months of age for stem cell trans - plantation. T owards this goal in the United States newborn screening using quantification of T-cell re - ceptor excision circles (TRECs) has been initiated in 15 states. This initiative has resulted in the early diagnosis and treatment of SCID infants, and has changed the inci - dence from 1:100,000 from older epidemiologic studies to a more recent estimate of <1:50,000 live births. Another approach to the treatment of SCID patients has been gene therapy. 27% of PID are diagnosed before age 6, but 51% are diagnosed after age 30. This latter group is mainly patients with B-cell immune defi - ciency, the most common of which is the Common Variable Immu - nodeficiency (CVID). The delay in diagnosis of these adult patients is 9-12 years and contributes to chronic lung disease and other comorbid conditions (Figure 2).

Asthma in the elderly is heterogeneous in origin and often associated with loss of lung function Co-morbid conditions can affect treatment. Smoking adversely affects outcomes Additional research into pathophysiology and phenotypes is needed to improve treatment approachesEPIDEMIOlOGY The prevalence of allergic respira - tory disease (allergic rhinitis and asthma) in the elderly is difficult to estimate due to differences in cut-off ages (55, 65, 75 e.g.). Nonetheless, in vitro assays for specific IgE in adults age 55 years in the U.S. showed that ~65% were sensitized to at least one allergen. However, a Swiss study found that only 26% of men and 18% of woman aged >60 years were sen - sitized. Skin prick testing of elder - ly Koreans found a similar lower rate of allergic sensitization (17- 18%). Chronic rhinitis was also fairly common in the elderly Ko - rean population (25%), but allergic sensitization did not show a signif - icant association. The Swiss study found the prevalence of self-re - ported allergic rhinitis to be 13% for men and 15% for women ages >60 years. The lifetime prevalence of allergic rhinitis in adults (18-79) in Germany was similarly estimat - ed to be 15%.

Allergic sensitization does not appear to be a major factor in the development of asthma in the elderly. The prevalence of asthma in the elderly is variable in different populations (T able 1), but appears to be rising over the past decade. Only 2% of Chinese citizens ages >50 self-reported having asthma. However, physician diagnosed asthma was higher in Hong Kong Chinese aged 70 years (4-5%). Doctor diagnosed asthma in Swiss citizens aged >60 years was 6.6% in men and 7.6% in women. Cur - rent asthma in U.S. citizens 65 years were similar at 6.3% (T able 1). Asthma death rate increases with age (Figure 1).PROGNOSIS Some 8-15% of older adults in the U.S. are annually admitted to the hospital. Often elderly adults lack a perception of dyspnea and hos - pitalized patients used peak-flow meters less often than younger patients and had less self-manage - ment knowledge. Women 50-60 years old being non-white and less educated appear to be at risk for hospitalization. Fortunately, when controlled for age, asthma is not associated with all-cause mortali - ty. However, patients with asthma associated with COPD have wors - ened survival. fUTURE RESEARCH Asthma in the elderly presents di - agnostic challenges defining the pathophysiologic mechanism, and further characterization of pheno - type can lead to better treatments. 252GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION f - Special considerations Smoking avoidance and cessation can clearly reduce the burden of asthma in the elderly.

Suboptimal control of asth - ma or more severe asthma during pregnancy is associated with in - creased maternal or fetal risk. Once the diagnosis of asthma is confirmed a decision regarding the need for controller medica - tion versus rescue medication AllERGIC DISEASES IN PREGNANCY 3 Key messages Allergic diseases in pregnancycan be made (T able 2). Inhaled corticosteroids are the mainstay of controller therapy during preg - nancy, but addition of long-acting beta agonists is appropriate, if re - quired to achieve control. Adher - ence to therapy can change during pregnancy with a corresponding change in asthma control. Most commonly observed is decreased adherence as a result of a mother's concerns about the safety of medi - cations for the fetus. AllERGIC RHINITIS Allergic rhinitis (AR) is usually pre - existing, although it may develop or be recognized for the first time during pregnancy. Patients with AR often report prominent sneezing, nasal pruritus, and watery rhinor - rhea, and some have concomitant ocular itching and irritation. Com - mon triggers include dust mites, animal danders, molds, and pol - lens. The mainstays of therapy are avoidance of triggers, oral antihis - tamines and intranasal glucocorti - coids. No important differences in efficacy or safety appear to exist between the various intranasal glucocorticoid preparations.

ATOPIC DERMATITIS Atopic dermatitis (AD), or eczema is one of the most frequently ob - served skin diseases in pregnant patients. Most pregnant patients with AD present with lesions on the flexural aspects of the extremi - ties, although truncal involvement is not uncommon. AD can change in severity during pregnancy, but has not been associated with an increased risk of perinatal com - plications such as congenital mal - formations. Similar to treatment of AR, the treatment for AD relies on avoidance of triggers and the judicial use of medications such as antihistamines for pruritus and topical corticosteroids (T able 4). URTICARIA/ANGIOEDEMA While there is no specific pregnan - cy-related urticaria, idiopathic urti - caria may occur during pregnancy as well as urticaria due to any of the causes known to affect non-preg - nant women.There have been no associations between presence of urticaria and adverse fetal out - comes. As in non-pregnant pa - tients with urticaria, the treatment of choice is oral antihistamines, especially loratadine or cetirizine as noted above. Although not stud - ied specifically in pregnancy for this purpose, leukotriene receptor antagonists such as montelukast (FDA Category B) may also be con - sidered for recalcitrant urticaria, and may be continued, if started prior to pregnancy. ANAPHYlAxIS Anaphylaxis during pregnancy is considered a rare condition with an estimated prevalence of 2.7 cases/100,000 deliveries. Antibi - otics are the most common trigger. If maternal oxygenation is com - promised there may be associat - ed fetal hypoxemia. Epinephrine remains the treatment of choice in pregnant patients. Anaphylactoid Syndrome of Pregnancy (ASP) is a rare complication of delivery in mother and/or infant during the process of birth. The maternal mortality rate worldwide for this complication is between 10 and 16%, while the fetal mortality rate is upwards of 30%. While the ma - jority of infants will survive, the majority will also incur some form of neurologic defect.

Atopy has been shown to represent a risk factor for these conditions in both competitive and non-competitive exercisers. ExERCISE-INDUCED bRONCHOCONSTRICTION Exercise-Induced Bronchocon - striction (EIB) represents a sign of poor asthma control. However, EIB may also occur in subjects with no evidence of clinical asthma, particularly in children, athletes, patients with atopy or rhinitis and following respiratory infections. The type, duration and intensity of physical exercise and environmen - tal conditions are critical factors for the occurrence of EIB. EIB recognizes a peculiar patho-physiological pathway. The hyperventilation, particularly of cold and dry air, causes water loss and increased osmolarity of the airways which results in epitheli - al damage and release of several inflammatory agents. Additional mechanisms have been suggested.AllERGIC DISEASES AND SPORTS 4 Key messages Allergic diseases and sportsSelf-reported symptoms after exercise are not sufficient for a diagnosis of EIB, which has to be documented through pulmonary function tests before and after a standardized bronchial provo - cation. Exercise challenge or its surrogate indirect tests (Eucap - nyc Voluntary Hyperpnea and Hypertonic Saline or Mannitol) are recommended. Direct bron - chial provocation with histamine or methacholine is less accurate to document EIB, particularly in sub - jects without underlying asthma. EIB is usually efficiently reversed by beta-2 adrenergic agent inhala -tion. The best preventive strategy for EIB in asthmatics is represent - ed by achieving complete asth - ma control, according to GINA guidelines. Prevention of EIB in subjects without clinical asthma includes both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic measures. RHINITIS AND CONJUNCTIVITIS Allergic rhino-conjunctivitis is a very frequent condition in exercisers. The type of sport influences mech - anisms and symptoms (swimmer, winter, runner, boxer nose).

Rhinitis and conjunc tivitis also occur in non-allergic subjects: non-allergic rhinitis with neutrophilia has been reported in swimmers (Figure 1), possibly in relation to chlorine exposure, while cold air exposure may cause vas - omotor rhinitis in winter athletes. Diagnosis and treatment do not differ from those recommended by ARIA guidelines in the general pop - ulation. Particular attention should be placed on the potential negative effects on vigilance and reaction times of anti-histamines, particular - ly of those of the first-generation. AllERGIC SKIN DISEASES Urticaria and angioedema may oc - cur not only in relation to physical activity, but also to other factors connected to the specific sport practiced (pressure by sport in - struments; exposure to water, cold, sun, etc.). Sports instruments and vests (often made by rubber) may cause allergic contact derma - titis and anaphylaxis (EIAn) is a rare, but unpredictable and severe, syndrome in which anaphylaxis occurs in conjunc - tion with exercise. EIAn is often associated with food allergy and may only occur as a combination of exercise and ingestion of the sensitizing food (FDEIAn). There - fore, an accurate diagnosis of food allergy (including molecular diag - nostics) has to be made in subjects with EIAn, and the sensiting food should be eliminated from the diet (possibly also avoiding any food in - gestion in the three hours before exercising). AllERGIC DISEASES IN ElITE ATHlETES Several studies indicate that sen - sitization and allergic diseases occur in elite athletes with a high - er prevalence than in the general population (Figure 2). Suggested mechanism is the combined effect of a strenuous, chronic training and environmental exposure (al - lergens, pollutants, cold air, etc.) on both the immune system (with a switch to a Th2 cytokine profile, this also explaining the higher in - cidence of infections, particular - ly of the upper respiratory tract) and target organs. Diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases in elite athletes require special con - siderations in order to ensure the best performances, while respect - ing current anti-doping regula - tions (T able 1).

More than a third have symptoms of rhinoconjuctivi - tis, about 1 in 7 have asthma and around 1 in 50 have food allergy. This group experiences more mor - bidity and mortality than would be expected, they are overrepresent - ed in fatal series of food allergy and asthma death registry data. Therefore adolescents deserve special attention in any allergy clinic. ADOlESCENTS AS PATIENTS Adolescence is a challenging time for any individual, even if they do not have a chronic medical condition. While coping with the Graham Roberts University of Southampton Southampton, UKAllERGIC DISEASES IN ADOlESCENTS 5 Key messages Allergic diseases in adolescentsphysical changes associated with puberty, they have to start taking responsibility for themselves and others, gain independence, devel - op relationships outside their im - mediate families and renegotiate the rules at home (Figure 1). All this may perhaps explain why adolescents are often poorly en - gaged with their healthcare pro - vider. For example, despite follow up in an allergy clinic, adolescent patients often fail to avoid their triggering food allergens and car - ry their adrenaline autoinjector. There are similar issues with asth - ma. Looking at an allergy clinic from the adolescents' perspective, they may see consultations as be - ing dominated by their parents, perhaps do not feel that clinic is relevant for them and may have issues around their confidentiality.HOW CAN WE IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT Of ADOlESCENT PATIENTS? During adolescence, children must develop into independent adults with responsibilities for maintain - ing health status moving from par - ents to patient. Parents find this challenging, and adolescent may have limited opportunities to take on responsibility for their health. The management of adolescent patients, therefore needs to pro - mote this transition. There are a number of generic ap - proaches that may help to engage adolescent patients: Ensure that adolescent patients are active participants in clin - ic using appropriate language, being empathic, respectful, and non-judgmental. T aking a patient rather than a 260GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION f - Special considerationsdiseased centred approach may help adolescents realise the val - ue of a clinic appointment. Slowly transition from parents. Seeing adolescent patients on their own for the initial part of the consultation may help to empower them to take owner - ship of their allergies. For individual allergic diseases there are additional specific ap - proaches that may be helpful. For asthma, for example, the focus should be on what activities asth - ma stops them doing and dealing with these by prescribing thera - pies that fit into their daily sched - ule. For food allergy, for example, education around the recognition and management of allergic re -actions should be directed at the adolescent patient using scenario based role playing and adrenaline autoinjector simulators.

Developing an optimal man - agement plan in allergic diseases depends equally on appropriate medication recommendations as well as the patient's ability and desire to adhere to the proposed treatment. Adherence is the ex - tent to which a patient's behavior resembles the \"agreed upon\" man - agement plan as outlined by their healthcare provider. The qualifica - tion of 'agreed upon' emphasizes the importance of shared decision making between patient and their providers. Adherence contrasts the term compliance, which con - ceptualizes the patient's role as limited to following recommenda - tions, without explicit considera - tion of patient's preferences and goals. In allergic disease, adher - ence issues have been most fully explored in asthma care, primarily due to the increased availability of traceable outcome measures, such as exacerbation rates, sys - temic corticosteroids use, emer - gency department visits, and hos - pitalizations. Patient's adherence to the \"agreed upon\" management plan can be difficult to assess and sometimes not evident until poor outcomes ADHERENCE TO THE MANAGEMENT PlAN 6 Key messages Adherence to the management planare suffered. Barriers to adher - ence are numerous and include chronicity of disease, increasing - ly complex medication regimens, high medication cost, and lack of perceived treatment benefit (Figure 1). Assessing the level of adherence is crucial and can be accomplished by direct patient interviewing, pharmacy fill rate, medication monitoring methods (pill counting, inhaler dose coun - ters, etc) or through biochemi - cal assays. Exhaled nitric oxide is emerging as a potentially power - ful bioassay for measuring inhaled corticosteroid adherence in pa - tients with asthma. Improve adherence is critically important in the management of allergic diseases. Written Action Plans (WAPs) may be a useful tool for the practicing allergist to enhance patient understanding of the management plan (Figure 2). In the acute care setting, WAP have been shown to significant - ly increase patient adherence to inhaled corticosteroids, improve asthma control, and medical fol - low up.

On an individual level, a clinician's practice pattern and the patient's individual preferences and goals affect the milieu in which the treatment plan is made. The particulars of the disease and the available medications make up the specific variable of this complex equation.

Even the most extreme and severe form of allergy, anaphylaxis, has a low mortality rate. Allergic diseas - es rarely lead to traditional forms of infirmity, and societal aware - ness and concern regarding aller - gic diseases has thus been limited. However, research carried out over the last decades has shown that allergic diseases significant - ly impact quality of life (QoL) of patients, and this knowledge has dispelled many notions of allergy as being a \"trivial\" disease. Despite this, misunderstandings about the correct development and use of instruments measuring QoL may give the impression that these outcomes are \"soft\" and subjec - tive. In fact, proper application of good instruments generates out - comes that are neither. HEAlTH-RElATED QUAlITY Of lIfE: WHAT MATTERS TO PATIENTS? Health-related quality of life (HRQL) is that part of overall QoL, which is affected by health and disease (Figure 1). The most important aspect of question - naires measuring HRQL is that they are properly validated, as it is this process, which ensures that non-disease-related QoL is -Anthony E.J. Dubois University of Groningen Groningen, The NetherlandsAllERGIC DISEASES AND QUAlITY Of lIfE 7 Key messages Allergic diseases and quality of lifesues are excluded and that only HRQL is measured. Many in - struments have also ascertained the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), which repre - sents the smallest change or dif - ference in HRQL scores, which is clinically meaningful to patients. Thus, HRQL instruments can accurately measure as - pects of disease important to patients. In ad - dition, they can show if chang - es, for example brought about by treatment are relevant from the pa - tient's point of view. MEASURING HEAlTH-RElATED QUAlITY Of lIfE IN AllERGIC DISEASES Over the past 25 years, instru - ments for measurement of HRQL have been developed for rhinitis, asthma and atopic dermatitis, al - lergic diseases which tend to be 265GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION f - Special considerations chronic and where the impact on HRQL is of paramount importance in the assessment of management. More recently, instruments have been developed for measuring HRQL in patients at risk for ana - phylaxis, both from vespula ven - oms and foods, where the expecta - tion of outcome of future episodes and consequent avoidance behav - ior, rather than chronic symptoms, drives HRQL. The choice of the correct tool to measure HRQL is essential (Figure 2). Despite the eminent suitability of these measurements for re - search purposes, HRQL is usually a secondary rather than a primary outcome in most studies. Ironical - ly, symptom-medication scores, which are frequently used instead, are difficult to interpret, because it is usually unknown what chang - es are big enough to be important to patients. Application of HRQL measures in clinical practice is lim - ited by the lack of studies formally assessing the contribution of this information to management. KEY REfERENCES 1.

The other species are probably also affected even though data are only sparse. Major allergens include insect (flea, flies), environmental (house dust and storage mites, pollens, molds, epithelia) and food aller - gens. From a clinical point of view, the skin and the gastrointestinal tract are by far the most frequent - ly affected, even though horses and cats may present with clinical signs of allergic asthma. Insect allergies were the first well characterized allergy disorders in animals and are considered to be type I and type IV hypersensitivity reactions. In dogs and cats, fleas are frequently involved and flea hypersensitivity dermatitis was long considered the first cause of skin disorders in both dogs and cats. In horses numerous flies have been suspected to induce similar disorders. Affected animals pres - ent with intense itch usually lo - calized on the dorsal aspect of the body. In contrast, bee and wasp allergies are comparatively rare in domestic animals and are usu - ally associated with urticaria, an - gioedema and/or anaphylaxis.Claude Favrot University of Zurich Zurich, SwitzerlandAllERGIC DISEASES IN ANIMAlS 8 Key messages Environmental allergies mostly target the skin in animals. Atopic dermatitis is the most frequent dis - eases in dogs and in some breeds (French Bulldog, Shar pei, West- Highland-White T errier more than 50% of individuals are affected. Affected animals present with itch and erythema usually localized to the head, feet and ventral parts of the body (Figure 1). Canine atopic dermatitis is considered the coun - terpart of human disease and most of the findings observed in humans are applicable to the dog. In fact, canine atopic dermatitis is a Th2 driven disorder in the acute phase of the disease and is mainly Th1 in the more chronic one. The most frequently involved allergens are house dust mites even though sim - ilar symptoms have been observed with pollen and food allergies. AD is less well characterized in cats, horses and other domestic ani - mals but the disease is recognized in all of these species. Mites and pollen allergens are also involved in the pathogene - sis of equine and feline asthma. Equine heaves is a spontaneous occurring asthma-like condition affecting 10-20% of adult horses in the northern hemisphere and other temperate climates. Similar - ly to asthma, heaves is a chronic disorder of the airways, which is characterized by variable and re - curring airflow obstruction, bron - chial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation.

Clinical signs are triggered or exacerbated by inhalation of dust particles present in the sta - bles, especially those associated with hay feeding. Neutrophils and macrophages are present in large numbers in the airways of horses with heaves and may contribute to the disease through the release of several inflammatory mediators. Experimental models of feline asthma have been developed with cats sensitized to various allergens including mites and pollens. Sim - ilarities of horse heaves with the human asthma are currently being used to evaluate airway remod - elling and its reversibility in ways that are not possible in humans for ethical reasons. Research per - spectives that can be relevant to asthma include the role of neutro -phils in airway inflammation and their response to corticosteroids, systemic response to pulmonary inflammation, and maintaining athletic capacities with early in - tervention. Treatment of allergic disorders in animals is mainly based on al - lergen avoidance (insects: use of antiparasitic treatment avoidance or organic dust for heaves), use of allergen-specific immunomodula - tory (AIT) drugs such as glucocor - ticoids or cyclosporine and desen - sitization. AIT is mainly used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs and cats and is success - ful in about 60-70% of the cases. Bronchodilators and corticoster - oids are administered systemi - cally or by inhalation in heaves to provide rapid relief of airway ob -struction, or when control of the environment is partial or absent.

Allergy testing is di - rected towards establishing which triggers, if any, are responsible for the particular problems a pa - tient experiences. Once an aller - gic trigger has been identified, the management plan will depend on three main factors: (a) how easy it is to avoid the trigger, (b) whether there are multiple triggers and (c) how easy it is to induce tolerance (Figure 1). The possibility of avoidance de - pends on the source for airborne allergens. Pollens and mould spores may be ubiquitous and so avoidance measures are impossi - ble. In contrast, occupational aller - gens may be contained by altera - tions to manufacturing processes or air supply system. Animal dan - ders may be avoidable in ones own home, but may be a problem, if the patient has to visit other homes in the course of their work. Exposure to house dust mite allergens can be contained by exclusion covers, but has not always proved as effective as one might hope. In part, this may reflect the existence of multiple triggers, but it is also possible that the mechanisms, which lead to the induction of perennial allergic asth - ma and rhinitis are not the same as those which lead to its perpetua - tion. Extreme forms of dust mite avoidance, through living at high al - titude, appear more effective than the measures that can be achieved as sea level (T able 1). Drug treatment for allergies focus - es on blockade of key mediators of inflammation (e.g. antihista - mines and anti-leukotrienes) and more broadly on anti-inflammato - ry agents, principally glucocorti - coroids, which block the activation of key cytokines which augment and sustain airways inflammation. For full-blown anaphylaxis, self-ad - ministered adrenaline injection can be life-saving. More targeted therapies include monoclonal anti - bodies against IgE and against var - ious pro-allergic cytokines (e.g. an -ti-IL -5). Although expensive, these therapies are useful in the manage - ment of selected patients. T olerance implies that the individ - ual either ceases to react or has a reduced reaction on exposure to allergens, which previously caused symptoms. Specific immunother - apy can do this by deviating the immune response away from the allergic pattern. The results are more impressive for anaphylaxis to insect venom than for airborne allergies, but there is no doubt some patients do extremely well. Recent reports of inducing toler - ance in peanut allergy suggest that there is scope for further develop - ment of tolerance induction as a means of controlling food-related anaphylaxis. Anthony J.

Overview: avoidance, treatment, induction of tolerance273GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseases Several allergic manifestations of the upper and lower airways as well as the skin may exacerbate upon environmental exposure to outdoor or indoor allergens Causal relationship between environmental allergens and allergic symptoms is suggested by targeted avoidance and reexposure Exposure related allergies can be reproduced artificially in the lab or exposure chambers Complete avoidance of outdoor allergens in most cases is unrealistic. Avoidance of indoor allergens should always be tried as a first treatment of choice, however, results are variable a nd complete avoidance is not easy to achieveSensitization to environmental al - lergens may occur throughout life, however, the first two decades of life show the highest incidence of IgE-antibody-development to outdoor (pollen and moulds) or indoor (dust mite, cockroaches, pets, moulds) allergens. Sensitization usually precedes the manifestation of clinical symp - toms by months or years. It has be shown to be determined by genetic susceptibility, following a dose dependent risk. Children growing up in a domestic environ - ment with high levels of indoor allergens from pets or mites who develop sensitization during the first years of life, have been shown to have a significantly increased risk for lung function impairment during school age and for chron - ic persistence of allergic asthma. Therefore allergen avoidance or at least reduction of allergen ex - posure to the lowest possible level has always been a key element of the allergic patient care. OUTDOOR AllERGENS Given the fact that pollen with the greatest allergological relevance may be carried by wind for long distances, it is obvious, that com - plete outdoor allergen avoidance is not realistic in most cases.

Another pragmatic approach is to travel to privileged sites with low aeroallergen exposure during the main pollen season (seaside, high altitude resorts). INDOOR AllERGENS The key indoor allergens with global relevance are produced by different species of house dust mite (HDM). Growth and repro - duction of mites is facilitated by modern house insulation, higher temperatures and particularly high indoor humidity. Wall to wall carpets may also contribute to higher HDM allergen level. Hu - man exposure is particularly high during the night, since dust mites are found in mattresses at the highest concentrations (figure 1). While frequent vacuum cleaning and acaricides have been shown to be of insufficient, specific mat - tress encasing (Figure 2) which al - lows the exchange of humidity but not the transfer of allergens have been demonstrated to be useful barriers between the human body and dust mites in the mattress (Figure 3).

More recently laminar airflow systems in connection with allergen filters have been shown to be useful for HDM allergic patients during the night, particularly in severe, un - controlled asthma (figure 1).The elimination of moulds and their allergens obviously relates to indoor humidity. Strategies for elimination are currently not based on scientific evidence. Avoidance of pet allergens has to do with avoidance of pets in the domestic environment. While ex - posure to allergens from cats may be relevant in kindergardens and schools, most children spend the majority of time indoors at home, so that elimination of domestic pets is still a reasonable recom - mendation for affected families. Realistically we have to assume that still relevant airborne con - centrations from cats and other animals will remain in the domes - tic environments even months af - ter elimination.

There is no clear evidence as to why this has occurred. Infantile eczema and food allergy are usually the first steps in the allergic march, followed later on by respiratory allergies, including asthma and allergic rhinitis. For many years, food allergen avoidance in preg - nancy, lactation and infancy was recommended to prevent the de - velopment of food allergy, and possibly other allergic diseases, with the view that allergic sensiti - sation happens in the gastrointes - tinal tract and would not happen in the absence of gastrointestinal exposure. However, public health guidelines supporting allergen avoidance have failed to prevent the development of food allergies (Figure 1). This may be because allergen is required for the estab - lishment of oral tolerance and/ or because sensitisation does not occur via the gastrointestinal tract but via other routes. The immune response leading to oral tolerance develops in the gut and requires the presence of food allergens.

There is some observational evidence that initial sensitisation to food allergens occurs via the cutaneous route. For instance, early-onset severe eczema is associated with food allergy and topical exposure to peanut oil and high exposure to environmental peanut are associ - ated with peanut allergy. Currently, there are no clear guidelines other than recom - mending exclusive breast-feeding for the first 4-6 months of life and if breastfeeding is insufficient or not possible, hypoallergenic for -mula for high risk infants. Recent studies suggest that increased diversity of food within the first year of life might have a protec - tive effect on asthma, food allergy, and food sensitization. Further - more, early consumption of pea - nuts in infancy is associated with a low prevalence of peanut allergy.

In this regard, we can consider allergy as 'the canary in the coal mine'- a useful early barometer of environmental impact on human health (Figure 1). These environ - ment-driven changes begin in pregnancy, with emergent differ - ences in immune function detect - able at birth for newborns, who go on to develop allergies (Figure 2). Maternal diet, microbial expo - sures and toxic exposures in preg - nancy are implicated in allergy and in many other NCDs, increasing the predisposition, sometimes many years later. These same risk factors have ongoing role in early childhood, influencing the balance of gut bacteria, and developing immune and metabolic responses, and the predisposition to both al - lergy and other NCDs (Figure 3). The keys to prevent disease must, therefore lie in very early life be - fore the onset of disease, and be - fore allergic immune responses have become consolidated. Over the past decades, there has been a shift away from allergen avoid - ance strategies and towards more immunomodulatory approaches. This is because allergen exposure 'Canary'in'the'coal'mine' ' figure 1 A 'canary in the coal mine': Beginning in infancy allergy is the earliest onset NCD, and a sensitive early measure of the effects of the modern environment on immune health.

The optimal timing for introduction of aller - genic foods for allergy prevention is still the subject of research trials. Based on the currently available evidence, most experts recommend introducing comple - mentary solid foods from around 4-6 months, including potentially 'allergenic' foods. Breastfeeding is strongly encouraged, and there have been some suggestions that breastfeeding during the period that foods are first introduced may help prevent the develop - ment of allergy, although this is not proven. A more promising and logical strat - egy to prevent disease is to target the background environmental risk factors (Figure 3) that appear to be driving the rising risk of aller - gy and other inflammatory diseas - es - beginning in early life (Figure 4). At present, there are a number of trials underway to explore the role of immunomodulatory fac - tors such as prebiotics (soluble di -etary fibre) and probiotics, which may restore more favorable gut colonisation for the optimal meta - bolic and immune maturation. Pol - yunsaturated fatty acids and oth - er nutrients, such as antioxidants and vitamin D may also play a role in counteracting the rising pro - pensity for allergy and inflamma - tion. These strategies are likely to have benefits for not just allergies but all NCDs. Common risk factors will mean common solutions in overcoming the modern pandem - ic of NCDs, highlighting the need for cross-sector, interdisciplinary approaches.

Perinatal risk factors and strategies for allergy prevention281GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseases A variety of medications are utilized for symptomatic therapy of allergic diseases, usually in step management strategies Different from allergen immunotherapy, pharmacologic therapy usually does not modify the long-term outcome of allergy Treatment should be tailored to the primary symptom and to the severity of symptoms The optimal utilization of pharmacologic therapies varies a mong regions and countries. This variance may reflect the reliance o n sub - jectivity in the clinical assessment, the variability of disease phen o- types and varying preference of therapies in different populations The availability of multiple options is desirable to tailor therapy to the individualAllergic diseases affect over 30% of the population with variable sever - ity based upon allergen exposure and the degree of hypersensitivity. A variety of medications are uti - lized for symptomatic therapy. In general, the treatment should be tailored to the primary symptom or symptoms and to the severity of symptoms. Usually specific me - diator inhibitors, such as antihis - tamines provide more rapid relief, but are less effective for chronic symptoms, such as congestion. The variability of allergic diseases, their phenotypes and multiple treat - ment options have resulted in sev - eral step management strategies (T able 1, Figures 1 and 2). Combi - nation therapies are often utilized though efficacy data are sparse. As contrasted with allergen immu - notherapy, pharmacologic therapy usually does not modify the long- term outcome of allergy, although there are some exceptions. ANTIHISTAMINES Oral : Second-generation antihis - tamines are more selective for the primary histamine receptor than first-generation antihistamines, and fexofenadine has a very low central nervous system concentration. The result is a much lower risk of side ef - fects for second-generation antihis -Dennis K. Ledford University of South Florida T ampa, USAPHARMACOlOGICAl TREATMENT Of AllERGIC DISEASE 3 Key messages Pharmacological treatment of allergic diseasetamines, with a preference for these due to safety but not enhanced effi - cacy. Compared to first-generation anti-histamines, second-generation antihistamines have less anti-cho - linergic effects less effect on glandular secretions. T opical : Intranasal or ocular an - tihistamines are probably more effective for nasal or ocular symp - toms than oral antihistamines. The advantages include a more rapid onset of symptom relief and some benefit for congestion and possi - bly for inflammation. Allergic con - junctivitis will also improve with nasal antihistamine treatment, but a variety of topical, ocular an - tihistamines are more effective. Non-allergic rhinitis does not re - spond to oral antihistamines, but likely improves with nasal antihis - tamine therapy, primarily because of the benefit on congestion. Cur - rently, available intranasal anti - histamines result in mild sedation due to systemic absorption. Ef - ficacy of nasal antihistamines is less than nasal corticosteroids, al - though some studies show the two therapies to be equivalent. CORTICOSTEROIDS T opical : Intranasal corticosteroids are the single most effective ther - apy for intermittent and persis - tent allergic rhinitis. The delayed onset of action makes the thera -282GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseasespy less appealing for intermittent use as would be typically utilized for intermittent rhinitis. Intranasal corticosteroids are superior to the combination of oral antihistamine and leukotriene antagonist. Nasal corticosteroids are effective with as needed use, but efficacy is great - er with regular nasal application. Local side-effects are minimal and include nasal dryness and irritation and nasal bleeding. Rare reports of nasal septal perforation are in the literature, but this is very unlikely. There is systemic absorption of na - sal corticosteroid as demonstrat - ed with careful studies of growth in children. The magnitude of the systemic effects is small due to the low dose, but concerns of growth, glaucoma, cataracts and even bone loss are real, albeit limited in occur - rence. Ocular topical corticoster - oids are also very effective, but the side-effect concerns are significant with the potential to exacerbate viral infection of the eye, particu - larly herpetic keratitis, to increase intraocular pressure and to en - hance the development of cata - racts. Inhaled corticosteroids are the mainstay of asthma controller treatment and are recommended as first-line treatment (Figure 2). As with rhinitis their intermittent use is less proven. Local side ef - fects include oral candidiasis and pharyngo-laryngeal irritation. As with the nasal steroids there is sys - temic absorption with the risk of side effects such as growth retar - dation, bone loss or osteoporosis, increased fragility of the skin and suppression of the adrenal gland. T opical application of corticoster - oids on the skin is recommended as second-line treatment of atopic eczema or atopic contact dermati - tis. The lowest strength controlling the symptoms should be used. The potential for skin atrophy exists whenever topical corticosteroids are used, even with low potency preparations. Skin atrophy, along with other undesirable side effects such as telangiectasia and striae, can very rarely appear within 2 to 3 days of starting daily application, the greatest potential occurring when the application is occluded, when highly potent corticosteroids are applied or when the prepara - tion is applied to fragile skin. Risk depends on the strength of the corticosteroid, the length of appli -cation, the site treated, and the na - ture of the skin problem. Systemic : Oral or parenteral cor - ticosteroids are very effective for all of the symptoms of allergic diseases. Treatment with topical corticosteroids is preferable while systemic therapy is reserved for severe uncontrolled symptoms. Systemic corticosteroids have se - rious potential side-effects, which include sleep disturbance, mood change, appetite increase, glucose intolerance, aseptic bone necrosis, accelerated bone loss, increase in central body fat, and decrease in muscle strength. Due to the serious side-effect profile, systemic corti - costeroids ideally should be limited to a brief period of time. CROMONES Sodium cromolyn is available for topical treatment of allergic rhini - tis, asthma and conjunctivitis and limited benefit for food allergy and gastrointestinal mastocyto - sis. Since the action of the medi - cation is to inhibit calcium fluxes in mast cells and basophils, the benefits generally are prevention of symptoms rather than relief of current or active symptoms. Thus, the optimal treatment is regular application during times of active symptoms or utilization prior to contact with known or suspected allergen. Cromones have an excel - lent safety profile with no known, significant side effects. The neces - sity for dosing multiple times a day markedly diminishes the effective - ness of these agents, and they are generally not cost effective and only modestly effective. lEUKOTRIENE INHIbITORS Oral leukotriene inhibitors im - prove the symptoms of allergic rhinitis and asthma.

Biological agents (biologicals or biologics) have revolutionized the treatment of many rheumatic and immunological disorders and are currently being assessed for aller - gic disorders. Better understanding the endo - types and phenotypes of allergic disease may lead to specifically targeting the responsible molec - ular mechanism by a biological (Figure 3). Unlike traditional ther - apies of allergy, biologicals target a single molecule. Thus, the use of an anti-allergic biological ideally leads to the inhibition of a spe - cific molecule involved in allergic inflammation, without weaken - ing immunity against viruses and bacteria. The design and use of biologicals requires a profound understanding of the mechanisms underlying allergy. Allergy is thought to arise as an aberrant immune response to one or more innocuous environ - mental allergens, such as pollen, food, house dust mites, insects or animal products.

Concomitantly, B lymphocytes are activated by the allergen and under the influence of TH2 cell-derived cytokines produce immunoglobulin E (IgE). Moreover, TH2 cell-derived cy - tokines activate other immune cells, including eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils, which all pro - mote allergy. Biologicals target for example IL -4, IL -5, IL -13 or IgE. Some of the biologicals targeting IL -4 appeared to show some ben - efit in subgroups of patients with allergic asthma, while not causing any of the unwanted effects of conventional asthma treatments. Currently, IL -4 and IL -13-target - ing biologicals are under devel - opment and need further clinical trials with larger patient collec - tives and longer study durations.

The ef - fect of omalizaumab is limited, because it only depletes free IgE and cannot remove IgE from the basophil and mast cell membrane. It was shown that in skin mast cell response to allergen is hardly af - fected within 2 months, whereas basophils responses are dimin - ished within a week, probably due to the short half-life of basophils. Interesting novel developments are DARPins, which can actively promote the dissociation of IgE from Fc RI on basophils and mast cells within hours and in this way make these cells quickly insensi - tive for allergens. ACTIVATION Of INHIbITORY RECEPTORS A large number of immune in - hibitory receptors have been de - scribed in immunology, including on basophils and mast cells. These receptors have the potential to down-regulate Fc RI-induced mast cell and basophil activation. Many of these receptors signal through the so-called immunore - ceptor tyrosine-based receptor activa - tion these ITIM coupled receptors is Fc RIIB (CD32b), that has already been used as a target for potential treat - ments with fusion proteins. These 293GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseases studies showed that fusion pro - teins that co-aggregate Fc RIIB with Fc RI could be effective as novel drug candidates to prevent and treat allergic diseases. How - ever, a clinical trial with an aller - gen-CD32b conjugate has been stopped due to unknown reason. Other inhibitory receptors func - tionally described on basophils are expressed human basophils), LAIR-1/CD305. These families of inhibitory recep - tors include potent novel treat - ment modalities, but since these are not specific for basophils and mast cells it is a prerequisite to as - sociate specific mast cell/basophil targeting strategies.EffECT Of SPECIfIC INHIbITORS ON CEllUlAR ACTIVATION Several compounds that are al - ready in clinic do inhibit mast cell and basophil activation. A group of these drugs increase cellular cyclic AMP level via inhibiting phosphodiesterases, such as the - ophylline and 3-isobutyl-1-me - thyl-xanthine, siguazodan and rolipram. Although many NSAID potentially increase basophil and mast cell ac - tivation, nimesulide is a chemically unrelated NSAID that inhibits both cell types. Glucocorticosteroids, known for their anti-inflammatory activities, also inhibit basophil, but not mast cell, activation. Calcineu- rin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine A and FK-506 also inhibit basophil and mast cell activation, including inhibiting the synthesis of IL -4 and preformed figure 1 Basophils and mast cells activation by different type of stimuli. The most prominent activation is via allergen interactions with IgE causing crosslinking of Fc RI. Also other ligands can stimulate the cells via binding to specific receptors. For other triggers activators receptors are not completely clear. Activation of basophils and mast cells results in release of several types of mediators and cytokines/chemokines that are important in allergic diseases. figure 2 Degranulated human basophil.

There is much interest in implica - tion of specific signal-transduction cascade inhibitors that will block the signalling after activation of the Fc RI by allergens. In vitro ex - periments have described potent inhibition by inhibiting PI3-kinase, protein kinase C or tyrosine kinas - es such as Lyn, Syk and Zap-70. Very potent and specific inhibitors for this pathway have been de - scribed, but since these signalling molecules are not specific for ba - sophils and mast cells signalling, application in clinical studies is a challenge. REDUCING bASOPHIlS AND MAST CEllS fUNCTION fOllOWING AllERGEN IMMUNOTHERAPY The only curative treatment in allergy is allergen immunother - apy (AIT). Several immunologi - cal mechanisms are supposed to explain this effect; changes on T helper cells and induction of regu - latory T cells, the release of IL -10 and the synthesis of allergen-spe - cific IgG and IgG4. Although some studies have indi - cated that IL -10 can inhibit mast cells this is probably not its most likely effect with IgGs physical - ly blocking allergen to reach IgE on basophils and mast cells more likely to support the effect. In ad - dition, the IgG loaded allergens might still reach IgE on mast cells, but via simultaneous interaction with the Fc RIIb the activation will be diminished. Analysis of basophils during AIT have shown release of inhibitory factors in the plasma. Basophils responses to Fc RI signalling were diminished following oral AIT for peanut allergy, which seemes like an anergic type of response. Further research in AIT is focused on the development of allergen preparations that do not activate basophils or mast cells, while leav - ing T cell activation intact. KEY REfERENCES 1.

The signal triggered by crosslinking of IgE by the allergen can be inhibited by reducing IgE bound to the Fc RI, but also by blocking its downstream signalling by specific inhibitors. The inhibitors are depicted in red, whereas the positive signals are in green. Allergen-specific IgG induced after AIT can bind to the Fc RIIb blocking receptor.

T argeting basophils and mast cells for novel treatment approaches295GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseases Immune tolerance is the lack of immune responsiveness to sel f- antigens, and harmless environmental antigens such as allergens There are two major pathways of immune tolerance, central and peripheral tolerance, which prevent immunity to self-antigens during lymphocyte development, and environmental antigens, respectively Regulatory T cells play a central role in peripheral tolerance, inhibiting effector pathways that drive allergic reactions, including allergen-specific Th2 and IgE responses, as well a s cells that mediate allergic reactions such as mast cells and eosinophils Therapies such as allergen immunotherapy enhance regulatory T cell function to restore immune tolerance Regulatory B cells and immune regulatory subsets of other cells may play roles in immune tolerance to allergensImmune tolerance is the unre - sponsiveness of the immune system to substances, cells and tissues that elicit an immune re - sponse (antigens). It prevents in - appropriate immune responses to \"self-antigens\" present in the body's own tissues, which cause autoimmune disease, and reactiv - ity to harmless environmental an - tigens. Lack of immune tolerance to allergens (e.g. grass pollen, cat dander and house dust mites) can lead to allergic disease. Two major pathways of immune tolerance exist. During central tolerance immune cells (T and B lymphocytes) learn to discrimi - nate self from non-self during de - velopment in the thymus and bone marrow respectively. Lympho - cytes that recognise self-antigens are either eliminated (deleted) or rendered harmless (e.g. B cell re - ceptor editing). Peripheral tolerance develops after T and B lymphocytes ma - ture and enter the periphery, and results in the lack of reactivity to environmental antigens. One im - portant mechanism is through the induction of hyporesponsiveness (anergy) in T lymphocytes that en - counter antigen in the presence of inhibitory signals or the absence Catherine M.

This leads to peripherally induced regulato - ry T (Treg) cells, which suppress inappropriate immune responses through cell contact-dependent and -independent mechanisms (Figure 1). Treg cells are essential to inhibit immune pathways and cells that cause allergic disease, including Th2-mediated inflam - mation, allergen-specific IgE, mast cells, and eosinophils (Figure 2). A major Treg cell subset important in allergy expresses the transcrip - tion factor Foxp3. Young boys with a rare, X-linked, genetic mutation leading to the loss of Foxp3+ Treg (IPEX syndrome), suffer from mul - tisystem symp - toms of severe atopy including eczema, food allergy, and eosino - philic inflammation, highlighting the role of this subset in prevent - ing allergic disease. A second important T reg popu - lation expresses the anti-inflam - matory mediator interleukin 10 (IL -10). Blood cells from non-al - lergic individuals stimulated with allergen in the laboratory make significantly more IL -10 than cells from allergic patients. Individuals with severe allergic and asthmatic 296GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseasesdisease show reduced IL -10 syn - thesis. Because peripheral tolerance develops as a result of exposure to environmental antigens it is amenable to therapeutic manipu - lation. The best example is aller - gen immunotherapy (AIT), which involves administering increasing doses of allergen to the patient in order to induce allergen-specific long-term immune tolerance. AIT increases Treg particularly those that synthesize IL -10. Considera - ble research efforts are ongoing, including initiatives to identify adjuvants that can be used in con - junction with AIT, to improve its safety and efficacy. KEY REfERENCES 1.

Numerous randomized-con - trolled trials have demonstrated significant improvement in symp - toms, medication use, and quali - ty of life with AIT in both asthma and allergic rhinitis patients. In contrast to pharmacotherapy, the treatment effects of AIT persist after discontinuation and include prevention of new allergen sensi - tivities or progression to asthma. AIT has also been associated with significant long-term and during treatment cost-savings compared with pharmacotherapy alone. Globally, the two most commonly prescribed AIT routes are subcuta - neous (SCIT) and sublingual (SLIT). The efficacy of these 2 routes ap - pears comparable, with most dou - ble-blind, placebo controlled trials demonstrating an approximate 30% greater improvement in com - bined symptom-medication score compared with placebo (T able 1). Greater magnitudes of improve - ments have been seen in more symptomatic patient populations. Adverse reactions associated with SCIT include local reactions, Linda Cox Allergy and Asthma Center Fort Lauderdale, USAAllERGEN IMMUNOTHERAPY- OVERVIEW 9a Key messages Allergen immunotherapy - overviewwhich are usually induration and erythema at the injection site and systemic reactions (SR). Sys - temic reactions, which occur at a frequency of about 0.1 % of in - jections, are generally mild (grade 1 or 2), but could potentially be life-threatening or fatal. Because of potential for serious systemic reactions, it is recom - mended that SCIT be administered in a medically supervised setting with an appropriate wait-period after the injection. The safety pro - file with SLIT is more favorable than SCIT, which allows for home administration. Local reactions, such as oromucosal pruritus, are very common with SLIT, affecting up to 75% of patients. Local reac - tions usually occur during the be - ginning of treatment and resolve within a few days or weeks with - out any medical intervention such as dose adjustment, or premedica - tion. Which route is prescribed depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to, allergenic ex - tract availability, geographic loca - tion of physician/patient, patient preference and ability to adhere with the particular regimen. With SCIT the treatment regimen re - quires frequent - usually weekly - visits during the initial updosing 298GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseases phase. This is followed by a main - tenance phase, during which the injections are administered at monthly intervals. Many SLIT regi - mens require no updosing and the need for an updosing phase has not been clearly established. The maintenance dosing frequency for SLIT is usually daily. Both routes require multi-year treatment (usually 3 to 5 years). Adherence is equally poor with both routes and comparable with the low adherence seen with long- term pharmacotherapy. Interven - tions such as more frequent clinic monitoring, telecommunication reminders and educational pro -grams may improve adherence.

IMMUNE TOlERANCE TO AllERGENS Long-term clinical and immune tolerance to allergens can be in - duced by AIT. Its mechanisms include changes in the profile of allergen-specific memory T and B cell responses, the synthesis of specific antibody isotypes towards a non-inflammatory pattern, and decreased activation, tissue mi - gration and degranulation of ef - fector cells including mast cells, basophils and eosinophils (Figure 1). DESENSITIZATION Of EffECTOR CEllS Successful AIT is associated with the altered magnitude of media - tor release from the effector cells below the \"normal\" threshold of systemic anaphylaxis. The shift in the balance between allergen specific Th2 and Treg cells is cen - tral to either development of al - lergen tolerance during AIT and the recovery from allergic disease Marek Jutel Wroclaw Medical University Wroclaw, messages Mechanisms of allergen immunotherapy(Figure 1). In both healthy and allergic individuals three major types of allergen-specific subsets of T cells, the Th1, Th2 and Tr1 cells, are to be found in different proportions. Studies with MHC- class II tetramers showed a switch from dominating IL -4-producing T-cells to the FOXP3-positive and IL -10-producing antigen-specific CD4+ T-cells. T cell suppression can take place both in the second - ary lymphoid organs and in the af - fected tissues. Allergen-specific IgE and IgG responses. Allergen-specific B cells do not show tolerance or unresponsive - ness to allergens but skew from IgE-producing to IgG4-producing cells. IL -10 regulates isotype for - mation towards a non-inflamma - tory phenotype - IgG4. IgG4 is also a blocking antibody that pre - vents the activation and degranu - lation of effector cells. The shift in isotype production cannot howev - er, explain the therapeutic effect of SIT probably due to a very long life span of IgE-producing plasma cells in the bone marrrow. Suppression of allergic inflammation AIT efficiently modulates IgE-me - diated activation and histamine release from mast cells and baso - phils due to Treg cell-dependent mechanisms.

After the first administration of the AIT vaccine, there is an early decrease in mast cell and basophil degranulation and a decreased tendency for systemic anaphylaxis due to early desensitization. Then, allergen-specific Treg cells are generated and there is suppression of allergen-specific Th2 cells and other effector cells. Due to immune tolerance in Th2 cells, they can no longer contribute to IgE production, endothelial cell activation and Th2 cell homing to tissues, mucus production by the epithelium, and tissue migration, priming and survival of mast cells, eosinophils and basophils. IL -10 and TGF- directly and indirectly regulate B cells and effector cells. Other T cell subsets such as Th1, Th9, Th17 and Th22 are suppressed by Treg cells. Within the spectrum of changes in the immune system after SIT, there is a relatively early increase in the amount of IgG4 and a late decrease in IgE. A substantial decrease in the allergen-specific IgE/IgG4 ratio occurs after several months. A decrease in tissue mast cells and eosinophils and release of their mediators and decrease in late phase response is observed in the affected tissues.

Mechanisms of allergen immunotherapy303GlObAl ATlAS - Management of allergic diseases Subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy (SCIT) reduces the symptoms of allergic diseases and the need for medication, on top of the reduction of symptoms already obtained by pharmacotherapy SCIT is indicated for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, allergic asth ma and atopic dermatitis The beneficial effects of SCIT have been demonstrated with high-dose treatment After several months of SCIT the total costs of allergic respira tory disease management is lower than im - munotherapy (SCIT) allergen extract(s) are administered in a controlled, repetitive fashion, to finally create a state of tolerance, in which the patient no longer re - acts to the allergen. During the build-up phase SCIT injections are administered once to twice week - ly, with gradually incremental quantity of allergen (Figure 1). Af - ter reaching the projected mainte - nance dose the injection frequen - cy is tapered to every 2-6 weeks, without further dose-escalation. It is crucial to reach a high level of allergen for SCIT to be effective ('high dose' SCIT). SCIT is aller gen-specific, only those allergens adminis - tered in the SCIT. A correct diag - nosis of those allergens responsi - ble for the patient's symptoms is mandatory. Administration of too many allergens simultaneously is probably less effective. As such, the prescribing physician has to be thoroughly trained in allergy and SCIT to interpret skin prick tests or serologic testing correctly and select the right allergens for SCIT. SCIT has been shown to be effec - tive for several allergic diseases (Figure 2). High quality scientific evidence (Cochrane meta-analy -D\u00e9sir\u00e9e allergen SCIT improves symptoms and reduces medica - tion use in allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, at - opic dermatitis and severe allergic reactions to hymenoptera venom. Its use in latex allergy is still inves - tigational. Due to the risk of severe adverse reactions, SCIT should not be used for the treatment of food allergy, urticaria or ana - phylaxis. When given at the right dose SCIT with extracts of grass, tree and weed pollen is effective, as well as with house dust mite, animal dander and hymenoptera venom. However, SCIT has till now only shown efficacy with a limited number of molds (e.g. Alternaria and Cladosporium ). When applied in the correct way and by a specialized physician SCIT is generally safe. Local and systemic adverse reactions can occur (Figure 3). Due to safety rea - sons injections are withheld in un - stable patients and during acute illnesses. Patients with severe al - lergic diseases -such as severe or uncontrolled asthma- are not can - didate for SCIT, nor are patients who take systemic beta-blockers. High dose SCIT reduces the symp - toms of allergic diseases and the need for medication, on top of the reduction of symptoms already provided by pharmacotherapy. SCIT is the only disease modify - ing treatment available today. The effects of SCIT last beyond the duration of the treatment (Figure 4). In children with allergic rhinitis 304GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseases a three year course of high-dose SCIT reduced the risk of devel - oping allergic asthma even seven years after discontinuation of AIT (Figure 5).

Data are lacking regarding long-term safety and efficacy Further research and large, well designed, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials ar e needed before OIT can be used in clinical practiceOral allergen immunotherapy (OIT) for foods is one of the most studied research options for the treatment of food allergy (FA) in young chil - dren. At this time, management of FA consists of strict dietary avoid - ance of the allergen and access to readily available epinephrine. De - spite increased vigilance with food allergen avoidance, inadvertent exposure to the allergen is com - mon and can result in potentially life-threatening reactions. There is a strong unmet need for the devel - opment of disease modifying ther - apies for the treatment of FA and to develop a cure for FA. In the early 20th century, a report of a successful OIT regimen for the treatment of egg allergy was pub - lished in the Lancet. Recently, sig - nificant progress has been made in studying this strategy for the treatment of FA. WHAT IS INVOlVED IN THE ADMINISTRATION Of OIT? During OIT, doses of the food al - lergen (which are in the form of a powder) are mixed in a food vehicle (such as pudding, ice-cream etc.) and are ingested by the individual in gradual incremental doses, start - ing with extremely small amounts (Figure 1). This is in contrast to sub - lingual immunotherapy in which ORAl AllERGEN IMMUNOTHERAPY fOR fOODS 9e messages Oral allergen Immunotherapy for foodssmall drops of allergen extract are placed under the tongue, and are then swallowed or spit out.

Many questions remain unan - swered, such as tolerance versus desensitization mechanisms in - volved in OIT (T able 3), and long term data is lacking regarding safety and efficacy.

Allergic patients produce IgE antibodies against a variety of allergens, which upon inhalation, ingestions, skin contact and sys - temic administration cause severe inflammatory reactions. Aller - gen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the only allergen-specific and disease-modifying treatment with long-lasting effects . It is based on the administration of the dis - ease-causing allergens in the form of vaccines. AIT with a grass pollen allergen extract was performed already in 1911 for the first time and since then is still based on crude allergen extracts. However, the use of such crude allergen ex - tracts is a major bottle neck for the development of safe and effective allergy vaccines with convenient administration schedules because the composition of allergen ex - tracts shows variations, cannot be controlled by the manufactur - er and the administration of nat - ural allergens can cause severe side effects. Accordingly, only too few patients can benefit from SIT and the compliance of SIT-treat - ed patients is low.

MOlECUlAR CHARAC- TERIZATION Of AllERGENS: RECOMbINANT AllERGENS The possibility of isolating the genes coding for allergens by mo - lecular cloning has allowed to char - acterize the structures of most of the clinically relevant allergens and to produce them as recombinant allergen molecules in unlimited amounts and in consistent quality (Figure 1). Furthermore, sever - al technologies based on genetic engineering of the recombinant allergens have been developed to reduce the allergenic activity of al - lergy vaccines and thus to increase the safety of AIT. In addition, ge - netic engineering delivers recom - binant allergen derivatives with increases immunogenicity thus inducing protective immunity with fewer administrations. The first immunotherapy trial based on recombinant allergens was indeed performed with genet - ically modified recombinant aller - gen derivatives of the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1 and since then several successful clinical tri - als have been performed based on recombinant allergen molecules. Companion diagnostic tools based on micro-arrayed recombinant allergen molecules have been de - veloped, which allow to determine the patients reactivity profile and thus to select the optimal allergy vaccines for treatment. Further - more, the effects of vaccination can be assessed with the micro-ar - rays by simple blood testing.

First, they contain defined amounts of the allergen compo - nents, which can be manufactured in consistent quality with defined molecular and immunological characteristics. The composition of the vaccine can be tailored ac - cording to patient's sensitizations. T ogether with recombinant aller - gen-based diagnostic tests as com - panion diagnostics one can expect more and more personalized and stratified treatments becoming available which suit the individual allergic patients best. Importantly, the allergenic activity of the vac - cines can be strongly reduced so that the risk of side effects can be minimized. This allows avoiding inconvenient up-dosing schedules and treatments based on numer - ous injections or daily adminis - trations. Instead it will be possible to treat patients with an optimal dose from the beginning with only few injections. Recombinant allergen-based vac - cines have been developed and successfully evaluated for several respiratory allergen sources and recently also for severe forms of food allergy (http://www.aller - gome.org:8080/fast/index.jsp). Scientific projects and trials are on their way to explore the po - tential usefulness of recombinant allergen-based vaccines for the prophylaxis of allergy with a view towards the prevention of allergic sensitization .

A short course of 4 intradermal injections provided symptom relief for at least two yearsAllergen immunotherapy (AIT) is clinically effective and, un - like pharmacotherapy, is disease modifying. The duration of clini - cal efficacy exceeds the period of treatment. AIT has been shown to prevent progression of allergic rhinitis towards asthma and to reduce the risk of developing new allergic sensitizations. However, AIT is associated with frequent adverse events (mainly local, but also potentially systemic) related to the fact that patients are ad - ministered the allergen to which they are sensitized. Both subcu - taneous and sublingual immuno - therapy are associated with poor compliance. The allergenicity of whole allergen used in AIT is determined by the presence of B cell epitopes, which cross link allergen-specific IgE on effector cells, such as mast cells and basophils. The mechanisms of action of AIT are incompletely understood, but are known to involve modulation of both the T cell (e.g. induction of regulatory T cells) and B cell response (e.g. induction of aller - gen-specific IgG).

Based on the hypothesis that aller - gen-specific T cells coordinate al - lergic inflammation and that B cell epitopes on whole allergens are primarily responsible for adverse events, a peptide immunotherapy approach has been developed us - ing short linear peptide sequences constituting the dominant T cell epitopes of several major allergens (e.g. cat, house dust mite, grass). In double-blind, placebo-con - trolled, clinical trials conducted under controlled allergen expo - sure conditions in environmental exposure chambers/units, sub -jects were exposed to allergen, before and after treatment over a three month period (four or eight intradermal injections at 4 weeks intervals). Clinical efficacy was assessed as change from baseline in T otal Rhinoconjunctivitis Symp - tom Score (TRSS) at different time points after the initiation of treat - ment. Clinical efficacy was demon - strated with peptide immunother - apies for cat allergy (Figures 1 and 2), house dust mite allergy and grass pollen allergy.

However, due to the currently long treatment duration and potential adverse events, only a few percent of allergic patients chose to under - go AIT and adherence is very low. In conventional subcutaneous AIT (SCIT) the allergen is injected sub - cutaneously (Figure 1). Most of the injected dose remains at the site of injection and causes local reac - tions via mast cells degranulation. Leakage of allergen to the vascu - lature or inadvertent intravascular injection may also cause systemic allergic reactions. Only a small frac - tion (<1%) of the injected allergen dose drains to the local lymph node where dendritic cells induce the T- and B-cell responses necessary for the immunotherapeutic effect. One possibility to enhance AIT potency and to decrease adverse events is by delivering the allergen directly into lymph nodes, where the density of antigen-presenting dendritic cells and responding T- and B-cells is maximal, so called intralymphatic ROUTES fOR AllERGEN IMMUNOTHERAPY 9h Key messages New routes for allergen immunotherapyproperties with a high density of antigen presenting Langerhans cells, but no mast cells and no vas - culature, which should reduce lo - cal and systemic side effects. IlIT : Direct intra lymph node injec - tion delivers more allergen to den - dritic cells, T- and B-cells. Simulta - neously, local reactions should be reduced, as lymph nodes contain only few mast cells. In fact, in the first randomized controlled trial, as little as three low dose injections of grass pollen extract into subcutaneous lymph nodes of the inguinal area proved readily feasible and painless. ILIT was found safer and showed ef - ficacy similar to a three year per - ennial SCIT regimen. These first findings have been reproduced by another group in a double-blind -ed placebo controlled fashion. In another double-blinded place - bo-controlled trial three low dose intralymphatic injections with a modified recombinant cat dander allergen (MAT-Fel d 1) were safe and induced a robust regulatory T cell responses correlating with IgG4 responses, as well as nasal tolerance to cat dander (Figure 2).

New routes for allergen immunotherapy319GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseases An EAACI Task Force recently reported measures to standardise recording of efficacy of allergen immunotherapy trials. A simple combined symptom and medication score (CSMS) is recommended as primary endpoint The environmental exposure chamber is recognised as a potential alternative for phase 2b trials Provocation testing remains important for proof of concept studies and for dose-finding The recent availability of recommendations for standardised reporting of side effects is a further recent advance Rather than reliance on a single primary endpoint, the totality of evidence should be assessed in evaluating immunotherapyAllergen immunotherapy (AIT) is indicated in patients with moder - ate-severe IgE-mediated allergic rhinoconjunctivitis with/without mild asthma who fail to respond to anti-symptomatic drugs and/or experience unacceptable drug-re - lated side-effects. Recent advanc - es have included the availability of effective vaccines with an accept - able tolerability and safety profile. Several documents have informed the standardised performance and reporting of clinical trials of AIT. These include guidelines for reporting AIT-related systemic adverse events and the documen - tation of local side effects during sublingual immunotherapy, there - by providing the opportunity for harmonisation of reporting of al - lergen vaccine-related side effects internationally. An unmet need has been the standardisation of clinical and surrogate endpoints for reporting the efficacy of AIT - the objective of a recent T ask Force of the Eu - ropean Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. The docu - mentation of symptoms during natural allergen exposure has been the gold standard with re - cording of 'rescue' medication as a key secondary endpoint. A re -MEASURING ClINICAl OUTCOMES IN AllERGEN IMMUNOTHERAPY 9i Key messages Measuring clinical outcomes in allergen immunotherapycent World Allergy Organisation (WAO) position paper suggested that these two clinical outcomes are critically related and could be combined. The major recommen - dation is the use of a combined rhinoconjunctivitis symptom and medication score (CSMS) as the key primary outcome in AIT trials. The symptom score is recorded on a scale of 0-3 for 6 symptoms, 4 for rhinitis (itching, sneezing, run - ny nose and nasal blockage) and 2 for conjunctival symptoms (itchy/ red eyes and eye swelling). This provides a maximum total score of 0-18/6 ie range 0-3 maximum for symptoms. There is a caveat in that for mite-induced perennial symptoms the total nasal symp - tom score ( ie 4 symptoms, total 0-12/4, still giving 0-3 maximum) may be a reasonable alternative, as the consensus panel considered eye symptoms as less common/ bothersome in mite-induced dis - ease. The rescue medication score is recorded on a comparable 0-3 scale according to the 'as needed' daily intake of oral and/or topical antihistamine (score 1), intranasal steroid (score 2, with or without antihistamines) and oral predniso - lone (maximal score 3, with/with - out nasal steroid and/or antihis - tamine). This approach provides a scale of 0-6 for the CSMS. The score is in line with the European Stephen R.

None-the-less the CSMS will require testing and validation in comparison with al - ternative methods in clinical trials. Allergen provocation testing is of the value for proof of concept studies and for allergen dose-find - ing for subsequent phase 2b-phase 3 trials. The use of a daily seasonal symp - tom and medication score is crit - ically dependent on the pollen count, with low counts resulting in a marked reduction in power to detect treatment differences. In this context the Environmental ex - posure chamber was considered a potential alternative for phase 2b trials and as an adjunct to phase 3 field studies, with the caveat that this method requires standardisa - tion within and between centres before use in multi-centre studies.

Measuring clinical outcomes in allergen immunotherapy323GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseases Lifestyle factors are associated with the development of allergic diseases Studies are hampered by the difficulty to precisely define a given \"lifestyle factor\" for potential link to causality and by confounding factors Examples for lifestyle factors proposed to play important roles in the development or presentation of allergies include nutrition, physical exercise/obesity, psychological factors such as stress, and smoking Lifestyle factors may be operative already prenatally Lifestyle factors are potentially modifiable and represent p rime targets for preventive interventions at the population level Further studies, especially interventional trials, should be given high prioritylifestyle factors (figure 1) are discussed in the lay press as well as in scientific publications in the context of the development of many diseases, and allergies are no exception to this. While many associations have been report - ed, the somewhat vague term of \"lifestyle\" makes it difficult to dis - entangle the effects of different exposures summarized under this name, and adjustment for poten - tial confounding factors is always a concern. Here, we highlight some recent advances regarding lifestyle factors such as nutrition, physical exercise/obesity, and psy - cho-social factors, and give hints on possibly underlying mecha - nisms. Additional lifestyle-factors that are not discussed here may also be of importance. It has been proposed that lifestyle factors might influence inflam - mation. Diet, physical exercise, behavioral changes might influ - ence the \"steady-state level\" of inflammation. This may, together with genetic susceptibility, affect different systems, including the immune response and thereby predispose to allergies. A critical window of time might be early life, although later impact on allergies and asthma cannot be excluded.IMPlEMENTING A HEAlTHY lIfE STYlE 10 Key messages Implementing a healthy life styleNUTRITION, PHYSICAl ExERCISE, ObESITY Food as an essential pillar of life stands in the limelight of most, if not all, human societies, at least once starving is not a problem an - ymore. It is held responsible for health and disease very often, by popular belief, as well as in some cases, by scientific evidence. In the context of allergies, food compo - nents can act as triggers of allergic reactions. Additionally, the role of nutrition in the development of allergies has received much at - tention. For a long time, avoiding potentially allergenic food during early infancy,e.g. by delaying solid food introduction, was the accept - ed state of the art. More recent data, however, have challenged this approach; studies show that food diversity in the first year of life or the consumption of specif - ic foods such as fish, goes along with decreased rates of allergic diseases. Accordingly, new recom - mendations do not advice parents anymore to avoid specific food for their babies in the absence of clin - ically manifest allergy, i.e. only for prevention. Closely associated with nutrition on one hand and physical exercise Caroline Roduit Zurich University Children's Hospital Zurich, SwitzerlandRoger Lauener Children's Hospital of Eastern Switzerland, St. Gallen 324GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseases Implementing a healthy life styleon the other hand is obesity. Obe - sity was associated especially with asthma. New studies suggest that the role of obesity may already be operative prenatally. For example, maternal BMI during pregnancy was associated with the child's increased risk for asthma, but the confounding effect of the child's own overweight in mediating such effects cannot be excluded. The fact that parents impose physical restrictions on their asthmatic children to avoid asthma symp - toms may result in a vicious circle further aggravating the children's situation. Management approach - es including dietary interventions for weight loss and routine exer - cise are safe in asthmatic patients, and improve important asthma outcomes, including quality of life. Asthma care providers should learn to facilitate weight loss for their obese patients. Pharmaco - logic or surgical interventions for weight loss in extremely obese asthma may be considered. SMOKING Many patients and parents of pa -tients spare no effort to imple - ment actions in order to alleviate their allergies, even in the com - plete absence of any supporting evidence for their action. In re - markable contrast to this activ - ism, sometimes an obvious thing to change in their lifestyle that is neglected is smoking. It cannot be stressed enough that one of the most, if not the most important potentially modifiable risk factor at least for asthma and allergic diseasesis smoking. PSYCHOSOCIAl fACTORS The psychosocial environment is of undisputed importance in the manifestation of allergic diseas - es. It is interesting to note that in German the term \"Neurodermitis\" is often used for atopic dermatitis, implicating a neurological/psycho - logical component of this disease. Indeed, stress and anxiety influ - ences e.g. skin test results. New data suggesting an association between perceived neighborhood safety and asthma or between fe - tal exposure to maternal stress - ful events and the risk of asthma and atopic diseases in childhood are intriguing, even if one takes into account the methodological difficulties, such studies have to surmount for adjusting for rele - vant confounders. Interventions might be suggested from studies showing the importance of psy - chological stress factors, although one has to admit that this might be more easily achieved on an indi - vidual rather than on a population level. lIfESTYlE fACTORS MAY bE OPERATIVE AlREADY PRENATAll Y In addition to maternal smoking, obesity or stress during pregnancy other exposures may be relevant already prenatally. One example for this is the observation that ex - posure of the mother to animals goes along with a reduced risk for atopic dermatitis during the first years of life. SUMMARY Many studies suggest an impor - tant role for lifestyle factors. The next steps should aim at defining figure 1 Lifestyle factors influence allergy risk.325GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseaseseven more precisely protective and harmful exposures and at in - vestigating potential underlying mechanisms.

Implementing a healthy life style326GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseases Having an allergic condition can be associated with significan t psychological burden for the patient and their families Adopting a bio-psychosocial approach when consulting with a patient with allergy ensures that the wider consequences of their allergies are addressed and not just their physical symptoms Psychological interventions may be helpful in the management of patients with allergic diseases and their families, but there is currently limited evidence of their effectiveness Clinicians need to be alert to the possibility of psychological co-morbidities, which means being attentive to changes in their patient's emotional wellbeing and be willing to work with relatives, schools or workplaces to generate a safe and supportive environmentThere is increasing awareness and evidence of the psychologi - cal and social impacts of allergy on patients and their families. Psychological factors may also be an aggravating factor for allergic conditions. Stress has been recog - nised as a trigger for asthma and eczema, and conversely post-trau - matic stress disorder may follow near fatal episodes of asthma or anaphylaxis. Under performance and lack of attentiveness may arise from the allergic symptoms them - selves, from disease complica - tions, or from allergy treatments. In children, underperformance in the classroom may have a critical impact on their educational at - tainment and socialisation. Food allergic children may be bullied, teased or harassed, because of the need to avoid certain foods and to carry medication with them at all times. The same applies for the need to carry rescue inhalers for asthma. Allergic diseases rarely impact solely on the affected individu - al, but their effects ripple out to parents, dependents, friends and peers. Examples include eczema - tous itching disturbing the sleep patterns of both parents and child, or the snoring and sneezing of a Helen Smith Brighton & Sussex Medical School Brighton, UKPSYCHOlOGICAl SUPPORT IN THE MANAGEMENT Of AllERGIC PATIENTS 11 Key messages Psychological support in the management of allergic patientsrhinitic adult interrupting their partner's rest. Food avoidance within a family appears to have exceptionally far reaching impact; it may distort everyone's dietary intake, reduce family cohesion, inhibit family activities and make mealtimes particularly stressful. So clinicians need to be constantly aware of the possible psychologi - cal effects of allergic illness and its management on both the patient and their family. Patients with an allergic disease require not just an in-depth assessment of their physical problems, appropriate medication and advice, but also consideration of and support for the psycho-social aspects of their condition (Figure 1). There are a range of interventions used in clinical practice to help re - duce patients' fears, concerns and stress and to improve their coping mechanisms. These include edu - cational interventions and vari - ous psychological interventions, such as behavioural therapies, cognitive therapies, relaxation techniques and counselling (T able 1). Educational and psychological approaches may be combined in a single intervention requiring mul - ti-disciplinary working of health care professionals, psychologists, social workers, teachers and sup -327GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseases port groups. Many educational programs are based on \"Social Learning Theory\" and strive to improve self efficacy through improving knowledge, skills and confidence. A simple psycholog - ical technique such as relaxation might work in an eczematous patient by reducing anxiety and stress which exacerbate their per - ception of itch. In paediatrics, the interventions may be offered to the parents rather than to the al - lergic child. For example cognitive behavioural therapy may help par - ents of food allergic children de - velop new ways to deal with their stress and low mood. If successful, the therapy improves their quality of life as well as that of their aller - gic child. Whilst patients report individual benefit from psychological inter -ventions and some clinicians have case series supporting their use, we lack rigorous evidence about which interventions impact best on psychological distress, quali - ty of life and symptoms. Despite this paucity of evidence adoption of a bio-psychosocial approach when developing a management plan ensures that the wider conse - quences of allergy are addressed.TAblE 1 Overview of Psychological and Educational Interventions Psychological Interventions Behavioural interventionsThe therapist uses behavioural therapy to modify the patient or carer's behaviour. For eczema habit reversal behavioural therapy is used to break the patient's habit of unconscious, repetitive scratching and also to develop less damaging behaviours when there is a real desire to scratch. Relaxation techniquesCan be used to reduce stress and anxiety. There are many such techniques (also known as arousal reduction techniques). Two widely used methods are: Progressive relaxation : teaches individual to tense different muscles groups in their body and then relax them. The individual becomes able to recognise areas of tension and to consciously release that tension. Visualisation (or guided imagery): teaches the individual to use images associated with relaxation and calmness to purposefully induce these feelings in their own body Other relaxation techniques are hypnotherapy , autogenic training and biofeedback . Psychological therapiesThese are predominantly 'talking therapies' that enable people to develop improved insight into their problems and then change their thought processes, behaviour and coping style. Cognitive behavioural therapy uses a strong theoretical base to achieve these changes whereas in counselling a non-directive, non-judgemental approach is used to support the individual develop more effective ways to cope. Family therapy focuses on the family rather than the individual and facilitates discussion between family members of the challenges of coping with allergies, and together they develop improved strategies for change. Educational interventions Need to address the skills and confidence, as well as their knowledge, if they are to be successful Can use a variety of instructional strategies (booklets, role play, problem solving, computer assisted instruction etc) Can be delivered to individuals, to families or groups Can be combined with psychological interventions for enhanced impact Psychological support in the management of allergic patients328GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseasesKEY REfERENCES 1.

There is no question that phar - macogenetics of glucocorticoids pathways has identified gene- tic variance that defines severity within the asthmatic populations together with differential re - sponses to treatment with glu - cocorticoids. Genetic studies in - cluded in the asthma Childhood Management Program (CAMP) identified SNPs in the CRHRI gene associated with changes in FEV1 in response to inhaled glu -cocorticosteroids (ICS). Similarly, the genetic variance in the TBX2I gene identifies differences in the response to ICS in Asian popu - lation. Further studies identified variations in a number of genes in - cluding ORDML3 and cytochrome genes (CYP3A4, 3A5, 3A7) that correlate with the response to ICS. In addition, genetic variants within the low affinity IgE Fc re - ceptor, CD23 or Fc R2, have also been associated with the variabil - ity of response to ICS in the CAMP study. Pharmacogenetics of the 2 AR pathway has been of great inter -330GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseasesest, because of the possibility of bronchodilator responses corre - lating with greater risk for asthma exacerbations and even mortality. A variety of studies have identified changes in Arginine and Glycine at position 16 of the 2 AR gene sep - arating responders from non-re - sponders to the bronchodilator ef - fects of long acting beta2 agonists. On the contrary, the association of asthma severity and mortality with any of these genetic variants has proven illusive. Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor genes also have been associated with asthma responses to treat - ment. In addition, variants in 5-lipoxygenase genes predict re - sponses to the 5-lipoxygenase in - hibitor Zileuton. All of these responses in the var - ious treatment pathways in asth - ma are clearly influenced by ge - netic variants that control drug treatments. Pharmacogenomics identifies multiple pathways of genes that might be activated in response to treatments. Several studies are undergoing, but the data is not available for publica - tion as yet. A number of the genetic variants seen in the Th2 responses have been associated with severity and responses to treatment in chronic rhinosinusitis and in atopic der - matitis (AD). Th2 genetic variants have also been identified as being potential contributors to AD, as well as a variety of genes including filaggrin that are important for the integrity of the epithelial barrier. In addition, a variety of genetic variants have been identified in the histamine pathway and recep - tor system that influence allergy. fUTURE PHARMACOGENETICS APPROACHES There is no doubt that selection responders to treatment based on genetic variants will eventually be an accepted clinical attribute.

Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics of allergic diseases331GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseases Allergic diseases are amongst the most common and costly chronic conditions seen in westernized societies; both direct and indirect costs contribute substantially to disease burden Allergic rhinitis (AR) is the fifth costliest chronic disease in the U.S., with estimated direct costs exceeding $11 billion in 2005. The direct cost of AR in Europe are not known but was estimated at \u20ac1.0 to \u20ac1.5 billion in late 1990s Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) has a disease-modifying effect that can prevent the progression of AR to asthma, the development of new allergy sensitivities, and progression of disease severity These combined outcomes translate the clinical efficacy of A IT into a significant economic benefit. This economic benefit has been confirmed in a number of studies that have compared subcutaneous and /or sublingual AIT with standard drug treatment from several different perspectives e.g. societal, healthcare system or 3rd-party payerAllergic respiratory diseases are amongst the most common and costly chronic conditions seen in westernized societies. Globally, allergic rhinitis (AR) is the most common allergic disease affecting approximately 500 million peo - ple world-wide, including an esti - mated 113 million in Europe and 30-60 million in the United States (U.S.) The prevalence rate of phy - sician-diagnosed asthma was 4.3% in a 2002-2003 Global Health Survey, but varied by as much as 21-fold amongst the 70 countries surveyed. Both conditions can be associated with a number of symp - toms and comorbid illnesses that can significantly contribute to the indirect costs of their treatment, e.g., cognitive dysfunction, day - time fatigue, sinusitis, and sleep disorders. Allergic rhinitis is the fifth cost - liest chronic disease in the U.S., with estimated direct costs ex - ceeding $11 billion in 2005. The direct cost of AR in Europe are not known, but was estimated at \u20ac1.0 to \u20ac1.5 billion in late 1990s. The indirect costs associated with AR are considerable. In a survey of U.S. employees, the total annu - al cost of lost productivity attrib - utable to AR was about $600 per Linda Cox Allergy and Asthma Center Fort Lauderdale, USAPHARMACOECONOMICS Of AllERGIC DISEASES 13 Key messages Pharmacoeconomics of allergic diseasesemployee (2002 value), which was significantly higher than the cost for any other condition assessed including diabetes and coronary heart disease. In Europe, the loss due to untreated AR-related pre - senteeism has been estimated to be approximately \u20ac100 billion (2011 value) annually. While pharmacotherapy can be effective in controlling allergic symptoms, it does not address the underlying allergic cause. Efficacy requires ongoing treatment and the benefits are lost shortly after the medication is discontinued. In contrast, the efficacy of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) can persist long after discontinuation due to the induction of allergen-specific tolerance. In addition to reducing the need for long-term sympto - matic drug treatment, AIT's dis - ease-modifying effect can prevent the progression of AR to asthma, the development of new allergy sensitivities, and progression of disease severity. 332GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION G - Management of allergic diseases These combined outcomes trans - late the clinical efficacy of AIT into a significant economic benefit. This economic benefit has been confirmed in a number of studies that have compared subcutaneous (SCIT) and /or sublingual immuno - therapy (SLIT) with standard drug treatment (SDT) from several dif - ferent perspectives e.g. societal, healthcare system, 3rd-party pay - er or some combination of these perspectives (tables 1A & IB). The analysis design employed in these comparative studies varied and included 'real-life' retrospective claims reviews and theoretical economic modeling (e.g., cost-con - sequence analysis). The outcomes assessed also ranged from 're - al-life' total healthcare costs to theoretical Quality-adjusted Life Year (QAL Y) gained or number of asthma cases prevented. In some studies, cost-effectiveness was based on the presumption of persistent efficacy for years after discontinuation or prevention of asthma. There was some variability across the studies in the AIT cost-effec - tive or break-even time point. In a 6-year prospective study compar - ing a 3-year course of SCIT with SDT, the cost-savings became sig - nificant in the 3rd treatment year. AIT cost-savings reached 80% in the 4th year and was maintained through the 3 post treatment years. In some studies, the cost-ef - fective 'time-point' was reached several years after discontinua - tion, which likely reflects the time required for the sustained ben - efits of AIT to outweigh the AIT treatment costs. However, in gen - eral, studies that collected costs via medical encounters or claims data demonstrated significant cost- savings during treatment. A 12-year retrospective claims analysis ('real-life' data), which in - cluded ~7.5 million people, found an 18- month total healthcare cost savings of 30% in adults and 42% in children with newly diagnosed AR, who received AIT compared with a matched AR population that did not receive AIT. This study confirmed the findings of a simi - larly designed pediatric study, that found progressive cost-savings that were significant 3 months af - ter AIT initiation. These 'real-life' retrospective studies lend strong support for the cost-effectiveness of AIT.TAblE 1A STUDIES COMPARING SlIT WITH STANDARD DRUG TREATMENT (SDT) STUDY COMPARATORS TYPE PERSPECTIVE RESUlTS Schadlich 2000Pollen or HDM SCIT for 3 years plus needed; SDTCEASociety, healthcare system, 3rd-party payerSCIT < SDT over ten years.

They can result in limitation of activity and function and lower quality of life, particularly when they coexist together in the same individual. The prevalence varies between and within countries. Globally, the prevalence for current asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema in the 13-14-year age group has been reported to be 14.1%, 14.6% and 7.3%, respectively. In the 6-7- year age group the prevalence for current asthma, rhinoconjunctivi - tis and eczema has been reported to be 11.7%, 8.5% and 7.9%, re - spectively. The data on the relationship be - tween socioeconomic status and prevalence of these conditions have shown mixed results. Genet - ic and environmental factors play important aetiological roles. Those who suffer from asthma, rhinocon - junctivitis and eczema may also have a greater tendency to devel - op other allergies such as food and drug allergies. More research is needed to understand the aetiolo - gy of these allergic conditions. AllERGY TO DRUGS, fOOD AND INSECT STINGS Allergy to drugs, food and insect stings may present as acute urti - caria, angioedema, dyspnoea and other symptoms of anaphylaxis in the skin, gastrointestinal, respira - tory or cardiovascular systems. Anaphylactic reactions, although not common, may be fatal within minutes. Immediate drug reac - tions are seen most commonly with analgesics, antibiotics, radio - contrast media and muscle relax - ants. Food items that can cause allergy include shellfish, peanut and egg. PREVENTION AND TREATMENT Anaphylaxis can be effectively treated, if there is access to emer - gency services including adrena - line injections. Prevention strate - gies include increased awareness of food and drug allergy, recording a history of drug allergy in all pa - tients and stricter enforcement of food labelling laws.

GA2LEN developed into a EU flagship program and has achieved sustainability, bringing together an impressive number of European Institutions, resulting in hundreds of scientific publications and at least two 'spin-off' projects, 339GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION H - T owards a comprehensive global strategy for the management of allergic diseases MEDALL and PreDicta, embedded in the FP7 framework (Figure 1). Another milestone was the for - mal recognition by the European Council of chronic respiratory dis - eases, including allergies, as major disease priorities, after the pro - posal of the Polish EU Presidency in 2011 (Figure 2). Realising the need for consistent presence and involvement in EU and international political fora, EAACI has recently reinstated a Brussels Office. As the major part - ner and backing force to a propos - al by Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) for a Written Declaration on the burden of al - lergic diseases, considerable inter - est was generated and 178 MEPs signed the Declaration (Figure 3). Looking into the future, prioritiza - tion of allergic diseases will come through partnerships with organi - sations seeking similar goals in the field of health and research. It is clear that allergies share most of the major risk factors with other chronic non-communicable dis - eases. A global approach, familiar to those who deal with allergy, needs to consider all chronic dis - eases and the lifestyle chang - es necessary to improve overall health of the population.

This has resulted in an unmet need to increase in accessibility of aller - gy services for those who need it delivered by those who have the expertise to provide it. Late di - agnosis and wrong diagnosis of atopic disorders often results in increased morbidity, increased mortality, and increased resource utilization, all of which may re - sult in suboptimal outcomes for patients, who suffer from these disorders and for institutions that are responsible for bearing much of the cost for managing these disorders. One of the fundamen - tal questions that healthcare pro - viders and institutions are pon - dering is what strategies can be implemented to facilitate access to diagnosis and treatment of al - lergic disorders in a timely manner that will decrease morbidity and mortality associated with allergic diseases, decrease resource utili - zation associated with these dis - eases, and improve quality of life for the individuals suffering from these allergic disorders. VARIAbIlITY IN HEAlTHCARE ACCESS AND COVERAGE The highly affluent have few challenges accessing top quality Michael B. Foggs American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Chicago, USAPOlICIES AND STRATEGIES TO fACIlITATE ACCESS TO DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT fOR AllERGIC DISEASES 3 Key messages Policies and strategies to facilitate access to diagnosis and treatment for allergic diseaseshealthcare. Access to asthma and allergy care will vary based on one's socioeconomic status, based on the country within which one lives, and based on the availability of trained individuals to provide such care. The variable financial coverage for healthcare in dif - ferent parts of the world make it clear that one size does not fit all, when it comes to healthcare de - livery policies and strategies. Con - sequently, no uniform policies and strategies will be universally appli - cable to all people in all locations in the world. However, some basic principles may be universally ap - plicable as strategies for improv - ing access to healthcare in order to facilitate early diagnosis and early medical and environmental interventions for the treatment of allergic diseases. HEAlTHCARE COVERAGE IS NOT EQUAl TO A SOURCE Of USUAl CARE Several scholars have pointed out the importance of both health in - surance, public or private, and a source of usual care as important facets of healthcare accessibili - ty that are, in part, dependent on one's socioeconomic status. There are obvious advantages of each. Consequently, any strategy to in - crease access to allergy and im - munology healthcare in order to 341GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION H - T owards a comprehensive global strategy for the management of allergic diseases facilitate early diagnosis and early interventions should promote both healthcare coverage and a usual and consistent source of health - care. Data indicate that, compared with patients having both health insurance and a regular source of care, insured patients without a usual source of care have high - er rates of unmet medical needs and problems obtaining specialty care. The converse is very worthy of note. Having no health insur - ance, but having a regular source of healthcare predicts a higher like - lihood of being unable to get time - ly urgent care, prescriptions, and needed health counseling. Getting specialty care has more to do with having a usual source of health - care, (and with the characteristics of that usual source). In many parts of the world, it has become clear that having public or private insurance does not nec - essarily guarantee the ability to obtain needed allergy and immu - nology services if there is no usual source of healthcare. Actual receipt of care is clearly more important than access to healthcare. Therefore, any policies and strategies to improve allergy and immunology healthcare servic - es must ensure that these services are delivered and that non-aller - gy specialists are educated about when such services are needed. The take home point is that health - care coverage facilitates having a usual source of care, but it is the usual and regular source of care that can facilitate the provision of allergy and immunology services when they are needed. WAYS TO IMPROVE AND ExPAND ACCESS Despite their valiant efforts, healthcare researchers to date have not yet universally influenced policy makers to implement ideal strategies that will facilitate early diagnosis and early interventions for many allergic and immunologic diseases. T able 1 lists some useful approaches to improve access to allergy and immunology services. T able 2 itemizes some connected health options that could expand access to allergy and immunology care. PATIENT CENTERED MEDICAl HOMES AND ACCOUNTAblE CARE ORGANIZATIONS In the United States, there has been a grand movement towards patient centered medical homes (PCMH) governed by a primary care provider with allergists serv - ing as neighbors to provide allergy and immunology services. Many PCMH operate under the auspic - es of large medical agencies called accountable care organizations (ACOs). ACOs are healthcare de - livery systems that implement a team approach to coordinat - ed care and provide high-quality healthcare at lower cost for large populations. KEY REfERENCES 1.

Use access to care \"coordinators\" to recruit allergy patients and to arrange and coordinate their allergy care. 3. Educate primary care providers about when referral to an allergist is necessary and encourage the concept of co-management of complex allergic diseases by these providers with allergists. TAblE 2 Connected health options to expand access to allergy and immunology care 1. Utilize tele-health technology to allow allergists to provide selected allergy and immunology services virtually anywhere, including primary care provider offices, prisons, and remote areas. 2. Provide asthma screening and management via telemedicine video conferencing appointments. 3. Provide asthma and allergy monitoring and reporting via medical apps for smart phones and tablets. 4. Use web-based communication technology and portals to provide patients with automated alerts and important feedback after they have been diagnosed with asthma and allergic diseases.342GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION H - T owards a comprehensive global strategy for the management of allergic diseases Reduce risk factors especially environmental pollutants, improv e nutrition, physical activity, increase tolerance Increase capacity building and improve health care delivery, increase accessibility and affordability to treatment Raise the priority of allergic diseases at the level of governments, policy makers and the general public Establish and strengthen national policies and plans to promote interventions to treat and to reduce the burden of allergic diseases Support research that focuses on the increasing tolerance, early intervention and prevention and control of allergic diseasesA GlObAl HEAlTH PROblEM The prevalence of allergic dis - eases is increasing worldwide, both in developed and developing countries, in parallel with other chronic noncommunicable dis - eases (NCDs) and together com - prise a major global public health challenge.

POlICIES AND STRATEGIES The challenge to reduce the bur - den of these diseases needs a multifactorial and multidiscipli - nary approach involving several stakeholders including special - ists, scientists, governments, pol - icy makers, patients, the public, health care professionals as well as industry. Some simple interventions like physical exercise, a healthy diet and connection with the natural world and countryside are among potential ways to tackle this global health issue. Early interventional strategies through environmental control measures, evidence-based nutritional interventions that could potentially include pro - biotics, prebiotics or Vitamin D etc, or interventions like aller - gen immunotherapy that could strengthen immune tolerance are key elements for allergy preven - tion (Figure 2). At the same time the complexity of allergic diseases and asthma as identified from new research highlights the need of a more stratified and personalized approach to treatment like the use of newly emerging biologics and biosimilars. In addition, global epidemiological 343GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION H - T owards a comprehensive global strategy for the management of allergic diseases figure 1 Common risk factors for allergic diseases and noncommunicable diseases.

Policies and strategies to reduce risk factors for allergic diseasesstudies, increasing capacity build - ing, increased global research on allergic diseases, especially on preventative strategies and early life interventions, collaborative action among academic organiza - tions and inter-disciplinary cross talk, together with comprehen - sive, well defined nationwide ac - tion plans are needed. National ac - tion plans should target to reduce the risk factors, especially envi - ronmental pollution both outdoor and indoor, develop strategies to increase tolerance and improve nutrition and health. These action plans should be based on both scientific evidence and a broad clinical experience. The World Allergy Organization (WAO) has taken steps in this direction with the WAO White Book on Allergy, which provides a comprehensive view of the problem, includes re - ports from its national member societies about the current state of allergy/immunology resources in their countries, and offers rec - ommendations for action.

Furthermore, many syndromes have allergic (IgE mediated) as well as non allergic aetiology. Elucidating the patho - physiology of the syndrome facil - itates appropriate management, thus with regards to allergy man - agement, the first critical step is to decide whether the presenting complaint(s) represents an allergic or a non allergic disorder. In the primary care environment, many patients present with poor - ly defined symptoms, but with a stated belief that their symptoms are due to an allergy; it is the task of the physician to determine whether there is any medical basis for these symptoms or whether the patients suffer from medically unexplained symptoms/somatisa - tion. The actual prevalence of al - lergic disease is considerably less than the number of patients who believe that they may have an al - lergy. With regards to food allergy this difference amounts to some 30% of people believing they have a food allergy with only in the re - gion of 3% having this confirmed. Thus, with regards to allergy man - agement the first critical step is to decide whether the presenting complaint represents an allergic disorder.

DIETITIANS Within Europe, the development of allergy expertise within the di - etetic profession is in its infancy in many countries. There clearly is a great need for more practically and scientifically trained allergy specialist dietitians. The cornerstone of the treatment of food allergy is the avoidance diet. Therefore, dietary manage - ment by the dietitian starts at the beginning of the diagnostic phase to ensure that an appropri - ate avoidance diet is composed. In some countries dietitians are trained to take an allergy focused diet history with the aim to link symptoms to foods causing symp - toms and to determine nutritional status and deficiencies (Figure 1). In other countries dietitians are only involved in the dietary man - agement of avoidance diets. Avoidance diets can have a serious impact on quality of life and may lead to deficiencies and impaired growth due to extensive elimina - tions (Figures 2 and 3).

In the dietary management plan, issues such as label reading, high-risk foods, eat - ing out, school meals, day care, birthday parties, holidays, business and holiday travel and other social circumstances should also be ad - dressed to limit the burden of the avoidance diet as much as possible. NURSES The role of the allergy nurse is ex - tremely important. Nurses are a valuable asset in chronic disease management, and with appro - priate training and competency assessment can provide a high standard of care.

However, many patients with respiratory allergy do not recog - nise their condition and fail to con - sult a physician. In a study of over 9000 people in Europe, Bauchau et al. found that the prevalence of subjects with clinically confirm - able allergic rhinitis ranged from 17% in Italy to 29% in Belgium, with an overall prevalence of 23%. However, surprisingly, 45% of these subjects had not been previ - ously diagnosed by a physician. Many patients tend to use unprov - en means to relieve their symp - toms, usually without a proper diagnosis. Given the availability of over-the-counter reliever medica - tions for allergy symptoms, phar - macists are often the first health - care professionals seeing a person at risk of an allergic disease. Con - sequently, they are in a good posi - tion to identify patients at risk of allergy. In this context, community phar - macists can be considered a val - uable component of the primary healthcare team, and can play a major role in the early identifica - tion of the condition and guide pa - tients to a correct diagnosis. Many THE ROlE Of PHARMACISTS IN MANAGING AllERGIC DISEASES 8 Key messages The role of pharmacists in managing allergic diseasespharmacy-based studies demon - strated that pharmacists are able to identify, counsel and refer to a physician, patients with previously undiagnosed conditions, including type 2 diabetes, cardiac diseases, COPD and uncontrolled asthma. Recently, the role of pharmacists in the early identification of cus - tomers with respiratory allergy was evaluated in a pilot study, conducted by The European Fed - eration of Allergy and Airways Diseases Patients Associations (EFA) in collaboration with the Pharmaceutical Group of the European Union, the Austrian Pharmacists Association and the Austrian Lungenunion. Between April and June 2013 (high allergy season in Austria), pharmacists in 315 pharmacies in Vienna were invited to evaluate the allergy risk of customers with symptoms of respiratory allergy or asking for over-the-counter treatment for allergic symptoms, using the vali - dated Allergy Screening T est ASF Questionnaire. A total of 2297 questionnaires were completed. Of these 76% were at a moder - ate-severe risk of allergy (Figure 1), although only 35% of the total had been tested for allergy. Of the 1486 participants that were nev - er tested for allergy, 68% were at high risk of allergy (Figure 2) and 57% \"clearly felt unwell\" because of their symptoms (Figure 3). Pharmacists advised 49% of their Maximin Liebl Pharmaceutical Group of the Of AllERGYSECTION H - T owards a comprehensive global strategy for the management of allergic diseasescustomers to consult a physician for their allergic risk. Screening and case detection are a part of prevention strategies that seek to identify and limit compli - cations associated with chronic conditions. Screening for allergies may improve the quality of life of patients by promoting early diag - nosis and appropriate treatment and therefore preventing exac - erbations or life-threatening ep - isodes due to severe anaphylaxis or severe asthma. Based on the results of the above pilot study, pharmacists can successfully pro - vide screening for people at risk of allergic diseases. In addition, they can play a role in motivating at- risk subjects to consult a physician to receive an early and correct di - agnosis and treatment and overall improve patients' quality of life.

The prevalence of allergic disorders is around 25% in schoolchildren in developed coun - tries, and there is a rising prev - alence in developing countries (Figure 1). Allergic children must face not only the same challenges in the school as their non-allergic peers but also added problems due to avoidance of triggers, their symptoms or to the treatment used for these. Exacerbations of asthma or atopic dermatitis, and sleep disturbances associated to them or to rhinitis lead to increased absenteeism. The sedating effects of drugs such as antihistamines or the lack of adequate night sleep repair can cause presenteeism, a state in which the child attends school, but is not able to focus and assimilate the learning objectives, causing a worse school performance.

The role of schools in managing allergic diseases356GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION H - T owards a comprehensive global strategy for the management of allergic diseasesgic children from certain activities for fear of a possible reaction. The most worrying problem for children with severe allergy is \"life-threatening reactions\" , as is the case for those with severe food allergy or severe asthma. For chil - dren with food allergy data from registers of anaphylaxis report severe reactions, including death, occurring at school. Similarly, there are reports of death or life-threat - ening symptoms from asthma in school premises or during school activities. Recommendations have thus been made to obtain a safer en - vironment at schools. It is advo - cated that every child with a se - vere allergy is provided a written personal plan with instructions on how to act in the case of pre - senting a reaction (Figure 2). An important pillar is the education of all school personnel (teachers, personnel working in canteens or playgrounds) regarding the pre - vention, recognition and prompt treatment of severe allergic re - actions. The preventive meas - ures must be implemented also in school outings, sports, and leisure activities. T o achieve this goal, the collabo - ration between all stakeholders is warranted: healthcare profes - sionals including school physicians and nurses, school personnel, par - ents and families and associations of patients, all of them having an equal important role (Figure 3). There is an unmet need for legis - lative changes to define the rights of the allergic children and also the duties and the protection of school personnel when acting ac - cording to instructions provided by medical professionals.

The incidence of these dis - eases increase continuously every year, affecting millions of human beings of all ages, from infancy to old age. Allergic diseases are chronic conditions that affect the quality of life of allergy sufferers physically, emotionally and social - ly (T able 1). Sometimes the disease manifests itself in an acute form (asthma attack or anaphylactic re - actions), which can lead to death. These diseases carry significant health costs in different ways: direct and indirect, tangible and intangible. T o achieve prevention, diagnosis and proper treatment of allergic diseases, it is essential that there is an active collaboration be - tween all national and internation - al health workers including doc - tors, allied health, pharmacists, political and health authorities in addition to patient associations, who play an essential role.

This 10-year imple - mentation programme is aimed to reduce burden of allergies both at the individual and societal levels (Figure 2). This is done by increas - ing both immunological and psy - chological tolerance and changing attitudes to support health in - stead of over treatment of com - mon and mild allergy symptoms. Severe forms of allergy are in spe - cial focus, e.g. asthma attacks are prevented proactively by improv - ing disease control with the help of guided self-management. The second example is in the area of cardiovascular disease. Re - search has proven that lifelong-ac - quired behavior is unlikely to change, and therefore acquisition of healthy behaviors should begin as early in life as possible. A series of initiatives are being implement - ed under the lead of the renowned cardiologist and researcher, Dr Valentin Fuster. An example of in - novative tools to reach the target audience is the use a school-based program aiming at promoting health through a multilevel in - tervention supported by Sesame Street materials and educational background. 366GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION H - T owards a comprehensive global strategy for the management of allergic diseases Cultural beliefs Insufficient awareness Priorities Costs Insufficient coverage Suboptimal networks Costs Priorities Scarce understanding of condition Suboptimal empowerment Costs Lack of knowledge Cultural beliefs Time constraints Priorities Professionals Patients Society Health- care systems figure 1 Potential barriers for the implementation of disease prevention and control programmes.

Removing man from soil may il - lustrate how human defence to - wards environment shifted from protection towards harmful mi - crobes to non-tolerance of harm - less proteins. Our immune system must learn to live with new envi - ronments including reduced con - tact with microbial diversity, in - creased exposures to xenobiotics and other harmful environmental products, sedentary life styles and altered and altered diets, or we must take steps to change our modern life style. Reduced epithe - lial barriers, identified in asthma and atopic eczema, may enhance penetration of untoward environ - mental agents to an un-balanced immune system. Primary prevention aims to pre - vent allergic sensitisation and allergic disease, secondary pre - vention to prevent further allergic diseases developing. T ertiary pre - vention targets the person with allergic disease to obtain optimal disease control and reduce risk of disease deterioration. GENERATING RESOURCES fOR AllERGY PREVENTION AND CONTROl 14 Key messages Generating resources for allergy prevention and controlRecent decades have shown that development of allergic diseases starts early in life, even around conception or in pregnancy, and continue throughout life, exem - plified by the direct association between tobacco smoke exposure and disease, and by the demon - stration of methylation and his - tone modification of gene ex - pression by exposure to tobacco products. The role of nutritional factors in disease development, such as vitamin D and anti-oxi - dants is unclear. Epidemiological evidence suggest that delayed food introduction in infancy may promote allergy rath - er than tolerance. Thus, early oral introduction of food proteins in in - fancy may provide a natural prima - ry preventing strategy, although documentation of such a strategy is warranted. The use of microbial products in pregnancy or infancy for primary or secondary preven - tion of allergy is suggested, but ef - ficacy not proven. T ertiary prevention by immune tolerance induction is well doc - umented for pollen and insect venom allergy through allergen immunotherapy. Oral immune tol - erance appears promising to food allergens. Preventing maternal smoking in pregnancy can reduce asth - ma incidence through several mechanisms, including epigenet - ic effects by DNA-methylation. This includes reduced smoking among adolescents and women in childbearing age, including use of smoke-free tobacco (snus and e-cigarettes).Kai-H\u00e5kon Carlsen Karin C.

It is a subspe - cialty in 8 other European coun - tries. Some countries also recog - nize Pediatric Allergology as a full specialty or sub-specialty (Figure 1). The spectrum of allergic diseases is broad and the number of causative agents is increasing. Often, aller - gens cause symptoms in different organs simultaneously or sequen - tially. Recently, several develop - ments are challenging the role of healthcare providers in this disci - pline. First, there has been a steady increase in knowledge about the immunological processes that play a role in allergic diseases. No longer can allergic diseases be seen as solely IgE mediated, but rather are based on a complex and variable interaction between cellular and humoral factors within and outside the immune system. The increase in knowledge has lead to changes in diagnostic and therapeutic pos - sibilities (e.g., new forms of immu - notherapy, component resolved di - agnosis) and it is expected that this tendency will continue. Second, the STRENGTHENING THE SPECIAlITY Of AllERGOlOGY AND ClINICAl IMMUNOlOGY 15 Key messages Strengthening the speciality of Allergology and Clinical Immunologythe role of environmental exposure (allergens and irritants) and the impact of primary and secondary prevention (benefits and risks of allergen avoidance, infant feeding, application of pro/prebiotics, risk of tobacco smoke, role of epigenet - ics) are increasingly recognised as major players in the management of allergic diseases. Third, many ep - idemiological surveys have shown that the number of allergic patients in Europe and other developed and developing countries have in - creased dramatically, with one in three individuals being allergic. In addition, a notable proportion of individuals with respiratory aller - gy in Europe are underdiagnosed, undertreated, and dissatisfied with their treatment. Considering all the challenges highlighted above it is time to raise the standards of care and al - low access for the allergic patient to the most recent developments in allergy and clinical immunolo - gy science. The EAACI together with The European Union of Med - ical Specialists (UEMS) Section & Board on Allergology advocate a full Allergology specialty, formally recognised and structured. In order to set the standards for knowledge the EAACI-UEMS ex - amination on Allergology was ini - tiated several years ago. A further goal is to harmonise the training of Allergists in Europe. In Jan G. R. de Monchy University of Groningen Of AllERGYSECTION H - T owards a comprehensive global strategy for the management of allergic diseasesorder to achieve this, international visitations of training centres are being held by the UEMS Section & Board Allergology. Moreover standards for training have been set by the Core curriculum and Logbook on Allergology. Not only allergists, but also gen - eral practioners and other med - ical specialists take care of aller - gic patients. In order to achieve a rational distribution of tasks and responsibilities of different care givers, recently 'The Blueprint on Allergology' was published in the journal Allergy. In this publication comprehensive Allergy Centers (Figure 2) are recommended to coordinate patient care, allergy and clinical immunology research and training activities.

The Exam does n ot replace or substitute currently existing national examinations regularly held by national bodiesHISTORICAl bACKGROUND The idea of an EAACI examina - tion in Allergy and Clinical Im - munology goes back to some dis - cussion in the excom-committee during 2006 and 2007. 'The new Executive Committee (ExCom) members Werner Pichler from Bern, Switzerland and Gabriele Pauli from Strassbourg, France, proposed the idea of an common European Exam, and in particu - lar some young ExCom members supported this \"dream\" . On the other side, the idea of an EAACI exam encountered some skepti - cism, since allergy is handled quite differently by the various national societies, the rules to become an allergist/clinical immunologists differed quite widely and fear arose that by passing an European examination national regulations might be bypassed. After some internal discussion in the EAACI ExCom, and a positive outcome of the discussions with the UEMS in G\u00f6teborg in June 2007, where Jan de Monchy and Sergio del Giacco pushed the idea, both societies de - cided to work on an EAACI-UEMS examination. Both EAACI and the allergy/clinical immunology sec - tion at UEMS had already pub - lished some common guidelines and a list of topics relevant for the EAACI-UEMS ExAM IN AllERGOlOGY/ClINICAl IMMUNOlOGY 16 Key messages EAACI-UEMS Exam in Allergology/Clinical Immunologytraining in allergy and clinical im - munology were already available both at national and international levels. The examination was conceived as a knowledge examination based on multiple choice questions. The topics should cover Allergy (70 %) and Immunology (30 %), the later including also some aspects of Ba - sic Immunology. The decisive step for a successful examination was the recruitment of a specialised, professional institution (Institute for Medical T eaching, IML, Bern), which was specializing in creating and formulating exam questions and was already involved in other European examinations. Werner J Pichler and Gabriele Pauli co -ordinated the first steps, created and collected questions (which turned out to be the biggest task) and adapted them for the Exam format. EAACI and UEMS coordinated their efforts and in 2007 pub - lished their intention to organise an EAACI exam. The purpose of the exam was clarified (table 1). It was emphasized that passing this EAACI-UEMS examination was no license to practice in a country and this solved partly some concerns raised by National accreditation boards.

It was well or - ganized and the participants came from more then 20 states, even from outside Europe. The ques - tions were felt to be fair and 39 of 41 participants passed. After 2009 Peter Schmid-Gren - delmeier was elected as respon - sible for the examination. This choice guaranteed some conti - nuity, as he was familiar with the IML, being a candidate y himself in 2008. Moreover, the value of the examination has been approved by some national societies, which combined a local, oral examination with the EAACI-UEMS knowledge examination.THE PRESENT AND fUTURE Since 2010, each year 30-50 par - ticipants took the examination. A further scope of the examina - tion, to unify allergy teaching and standards in Europe, has also been approached. Regularly candidates come also from overseas such as Middle East, but also farer Asia, Africa or Latin America are partic - ipating as it offers a good oppor - tunity to enhance and check the personal knowledge in allergy and clinical immunology. More than 200 candidates, mem - bers of many National Societies, have already successfully passed the examination. The acceptance of this well structured and validat - ed exam is rapidly increasing and figure 1 The EAACI-UEMS Certificate of Excellence. EAACI-UEMS Exam in Allergology/Clinical Immunologyit counts in an increasing number of nations as a sign of excellent knowledge in the field of allergy and clinical immunology. The examination comprises ques - tions, revised annually from a question pool, and many new questions are prepared by EAACI T ask Force members and major Eu - ropean centres. They are carefully evaluated by the EAACI Exam/ Knowledge T est Committee and also the IML and are continuously adapted to modern exam stand - ard and techniques. A blueprint with relevant literature is avail - able on the EAACI website. The 180-minute exam contains about 120 multiple-choice questions, currently all in English. Language dictionaries are permitted, and translations into other major lan - guages foreseen. UEMS is strongly supporting the Exam, by promot - ing and collaborating in the Exam TF. Both EAACI and recently also UEMS are offering financial sup - port to enable on request reduced exam fees for candidates from low income areas. All candidates receive a detailed summary of their tests and, if suc - cessful, a valued EACCI/UEMS certificate (figure 2). The Knowl - edge T est in Allergology/Clinical Immunology does not replace or substitute currently existing na - tional examinations regularly held by national bodies. EAACI mem - bers have the opportunity to use this Knowledge T est as a very use - ful tool for self-evaluation. EAACI and UEMS are now proud of their successful exam. Even the skeptics have been convinced of its value. It proves to be a big step forward to better allergy training in Europe. 374GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION H - T owards a comprehensive global strategy for the management of allergic diseases The main difficulties in the management of allergic diseases in developing countries are caused by insufficient level of hea lth care, heterogeneous inhabitation and lack of educational programs for healthcare providers and patients A marked heterogeneity in prevalence is observed between countries or between regions within one country, highly dependent on environmental and social factors Management of allergic diseases is based on the availability of essential drugs and their financial affordabilityMore than 100 countries with al - most 85% population of the world are considered to be developing countries (DCs). The main diffi - culties in the management of al - lergic diseases in DCs are caused by insufficient level of health care, heterogeneous inhabitation and lack of educational programs for healthcare providers and patients. A marked heterogeneity in preva - lence is observed (T able 1). The prevalence of allergic diseas - es and their severity is highly de - pendent on environmental and social factors. Although it is hard to prove the association between high IgE levels and atopy in Africa because of wide-spread of parasit - ic infections, reported prevalence rates from the ISAAC study that included 22 centers from 16 Afri - can countries, varied for wheezing between 4-22 %, for allergic rhi - noconjunctivitis between 7-27 %, and for eczema between 5-23 %. For some higher-income African urban centers, the rate of current wheezing was comparable to Eu - ropean countries, and reflected an increase over the past decade. In general, the spread of allergic dis - eases worldwide is positively as - sociated with urbanization and the standards of living. One of the most MANAGING AllERGIC DISEASES IN DEVElOPING COUNTRIES 17 Key messages Managing allergic diseases in developing countriesinteresting findings of the ISAAC study was the striking difference in asthma prevalence in populations with similar genetic backgrounds from different environments. The prevalence of asthma was two times higher in Hong Kong, the most developed and westernized Chinese city, compared to Guang - zhou located approximately 200 km north-west. According to the ISAAC study the management of allergic diseases in DCs is based on the availability of essential drugs and their financial affordability. For example, chlorpheniramine and be - clomethasone are part of the WHO essential drugs list, while allergen immunotherapy is listed as limited accessibility. In Russian Federation and other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries the network of specialized allergy centers pro - vides sufficient care for allergic patients. Allergy and Clinical Im - munology is a separate speciality. For the assessment of the preva - lence of allergic diseases in Rus - sian Federation, standard interna - tional and European approaches are applied: ISAAC or ECRHS questionnaires, locally adopted questionnaires, skin tests, IgE measurement etc. Data on the prevalence of allergic diseases and allergens in Russian Federa - tion is shown in Figures 1 and 2.

Ur - banization, globalization, climate change, deforestation and other changes in land use, the creation and operation of large terrestrial and marine industrial food pro - duction units, and microbial and chemical pollution of land and water sources have created new threats to the health of both ani - mals and humans. These complex interactions impacting human health need integrative approach - es to cope with. A promising ap - proach, briefly introduced here, is the \"One Health\" concept. One Health frames the complex inter - actions between human health, livestock, pet and wildlife health, ecosystems health, climate, agri - culture, food systems, water and sanitation, and human develop - ment (Figure 1).

One Health, thus has be - gun to move beyond the status of a mere concept to become a truly global movement at the interface of science, society, policy and practice. This movement is deeply interdisciplinary and cross-sec - torial and provides a fascinating, powerful framework that a variety of professional communities and social groups can adhere to (Fig - ure 1). The One Health paradigm will be helpful in reversing the worst of current problems at the hu -man-animal-environment and de - velopment interface thus foster - ing a more sustainable way of life on our planet (Figure 2). Keeping in mind that more than half of the worldwide population is living in urban areas and rural exodus con - tinues to grow, One Health may become a crucial approach to suc - cessfully cope with all the drivers and consequences in urbanization dynamics.

AHA allows people to realize their potential for physical, social (eco - nomic, cultural, spiritual and civ - ic affairs) and mental well being throughout the life course. The WHO report \"Good Health adds to life years\" (2012) approaches ageing from a life-course perspec - tive and assumes that we age from the moment we are born (http:// whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2012/ WHO_DCO_WHD_2012.2_eng. pdf).

In its conclusions, the 3131st Council meeting of the EU invites member states to tack - le the problems, which constitute the biggest risk factors that could trigger a chronic respiratory dis - ease: tobacco smoke, poor indoor air quality and outdoor air pollu - tion. Health education of children, parents and teachers is recognized as important in this regard, as well as training of health professionals. Allergic diseases and asthma oc - cur very early in life and often per - sist life-long. They impact physical, social (economic, cultural, spiritual and civic affairs) and mental well-being throughout the life course. Early diagnosis, preven - tion and management of chronic respiratory diseases in children will help people to cope with their disease, to have a normal life and to age well.Jean Bousquet University of Montpellier Montpellier, FranceBoleslaw Samolinski Medical University of Warsaw Warsaw, Poland380GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION H - T owards a comprehensive global strategy for the management of allergic diseasesKEY REfERENCES 1.

Among the countless websites regarding allergic diseases, we can distin - guish sites with high quality con - tent from sites with low evidence grade and questionable informa - tion. Therefore, it is important that both patients and doctors may count on few but trusted websites, which are certified by the world's most prestigious sci - entific societies. TRUSTED WEbSITES fOR PATIENTS Probably the most interesting and comprehensive websites contain - ing reliable informations on aller - gies for patients, come from three of the most prestigious scientific societies in the field: EAACI (with it's \"Patients area\" , see Figure quarter), ACAAI (with the website called \"Allergist\" , see Figure 1 upper-right quarter) and AAAAI (with the \"Conditions and treatments\" sub-section of its main website, see Figure 1 low - er-left quarter) (see Box 1). \"EAACI Patients Area\" provides a large and comprehensive amount Enrico Heffler University of T orino T orino, ItalyAllERGY IN INTERNET 20 Key messages Allergy in internetof information for patients, rang - ing from the description of allergic diseases, their correct diagnostic work-up and treatment options, to information on how to inter - pret, in a evidence-based manner, complementary and alternative medicine approaches to allergy, and to providing easy access to useful tools for allergic patients (i.e.: information on travelling with allergies or pregnancy and aller - gy, the list of European and world wide patient associations, and a world-map of pollen counts). Both \"EAACI Patients Area\" and \"Aller - gist\" provide interesting interac - tive tools to let patients seek for symptoms or organ involvement to obtain information on possible allergic diseases which may ex - plain their symptoms (\"Think you have an allergy\" and \"Allergic for the AAAAI web - site). A similar tool is available also on WAO and ACAAI websites, but the latter is limited to nasal com - plaints (\"My nasal journal\"). An other website in which patients may find comprehensive informa - tion on a specific aspect of aller - gies, food allergy, is FARE (Food Allergy Research & Education). One of the important patients' need is to share their doubts/opin - ion with expert doctors and with 382GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION H - T owards a comprehensive global strategy for the management of allergic diseasesother patients; an \"Ask the expert\" section is present in most of the pre - viously mentioned websites, while discussion boards between patients are present in other websites as \"AllergyUK\" , \"Aller - gyChat\" or \"Health - Boards\" if these websites cov - er a patients' need, it is important to re - mind that they can - not be considered a reliable source of scientific/correct information on allergies. This is one of the reasons that led scien - tific societies as EAACI and AAAAI to publish their own Facebook pages in which evidence based in - formation on allergy is spread to a larger audience. TRUSTED WEbSITES fOR DOCTORS Both experts in these field (special - ists) and those who are in training (i.e.: residents) or more generalist doctors (i.e.: general practitioners) may need to seek for professional and scientific information on in - ternet (see Box 2). As far as scientific update, doctors may count on institutional and universally recognized database such as \"PubMed\" , \"EMBASE\" or \"Scopus\" to seek scientific or to a variety of allergy textbooks which are now available online. Internet gives also the doctors the opportunity to easily improve their career through institution - al websites collecting career/ jobs opportunity in the field (i.e: a specific sections into both EAACI and AAAAI websites, or specific databases into more generalist websites such as those of some prestigious scientific journals like NEJM, The Lancet, JACI, Allergy or JAMA).

The ICONs combine the best scientific evidence with international expert consensus and are adaptable to circumstances in all countries worldwide, allowing for modifications based on the availability of regional diagnostic and therapeutic interventionsThe prevalence of Allergic Dis - eases and Asthma continues to increase worldwide. In 2050, the world's population will likely reach 9 to 10 billion, among which 2 to 4 billion will suffer from allergic diseases, including asthma, aller - gic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. These conditions are compounded by a number of comorbidities.

The prevalence of aller - gic diseases and socioeconomic impact are particularly on the rise in urbanizing regions and globali- zing world in association with en - vironmental and lifestyle changes. Apart from individual suffering of patients, allergic diseases present a very high socioeconomic burden to health care systems and fami - lies. In addition, patient care and access to diagnosis and treatment is inadequate in many developing regions and countries. Effective policies and strategy development are needed to fill this gap at the global, regional, national level (T a - ble 1). The efforts to overcome high numbers of unmet needs in al - lergic diseases are described in \"section H\" and can be grouped in three directions: A) Research and development should be synergized and pri - oritized in order to achieve sus - tainable results on prevention, biomarkers, curative treatment, anti-viral vaccines, and novel Cezmi A.

There are a number of barriers and obsta - cles in grant giving bodies to be solved, particularly to support human immunology and allergy research (T able 2). B) Improved patient care at the global level requires a world -wide approach to identify bar - riers for prevention and cure, develop patient registries and next generation guidelines, im - prove access to diagnosis and essential drugs in low income countries, implement full en - vironment control, provide 386GlObAl ATlAS Of AllERGYSECTION H - T owards a comprehensive global strategy for the management of allergic diseases Vision and roadmap to fight with allergiespsychological help directly and routinely without any need for consultation and implement every aspect of education of pa - tients, primary care physicians and allied health personnel. C) T o increase the public aware - ness , it is now essential to pub - licly position allergic diseases and asthma as one of the most important causes of chron - ic morbidity and health care burden. Allergy and asthma focused patient organizations should be immediately estab - lished in all countries. A signif - icant number of international alliances, societies, networks and academies are working on this. Intensive efforts should be performed at the level of local governments, United Nations, WHO, EU etc.A worldwide strategy to fight and manage allergic diseases should be developed (T able 3). A) All stakeholders including specialists, primary care phy - sicians, nurses, dieticians, psy - chologists, pharmacists, pa - tient organizations, educators, industry, and policy makers should be involved. The roles of all stakeholders have been mentioned in detail in the previ - ous chapters in section \"H\" . B) The speciality of \"Allergology\" should be strengthened as a full specialty and should be world wide harmonized. C) Modern global guidelines should be developed and im - plemented for the management of allergic diseases, asthma and co-morbidities. The new gener - ation guidelines should provide structured, multidisciplinary, region and environment-ori - ented and individual patient-fo - cused solutions, with full con - siderations on differences across cultures. D) There is substantial experience of already established strat - egies and associations. We should avoid reinventing the wheel and utilize and imple - ment the existing know how. For example, one of the most valuable experiences in our fight with allergies is the suc - cess of the finnish Allergy and Asthma Programmes . It is now fundamental to disseminate the Finnish experience to the whole world, collect feedback and fur - ther improve. E) Global management of allergic diseases should be integrated TAblE 1 Efforts for increasing awareness in the political bodies for allergy and asthma Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA2LEN) was established with the efforts of EAACI in 2004 as an EU FP6 Network of Excellence. GA2LEN still continues as a non-profit network. Allergy was listed in the food and agriculture group in the EU research grants until 2007. EU accepted allergy as an important health problem in 2007 with the efforts of the EAACI and GA2LEN. Allergy is not included in Horizons 2020 programme. Many attempts and several one day awareness meetings have been organized in the European Parliament and attended by patient organizations, EAACI leadership and members of the Parliament in Brussels during the recent years, which were specifically intensified during the last year. ICAALL: The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology; the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology; the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology; and the World Allergy Organization have formed a collaborative initiative termed the International Collaboration in Asthma, ALlergy and ImmunoLogy (iCAALL) in 2011. 12 International Consensus \"on\" (ICON) papers have been planned and 7 have been published so far. The results of the Finnish Allergy and Asthma Programmes demonstrated that allergy and asthma burden can be substantially decreased by relatively undemanding methods doable by every country (Chapter H12).

In an era of climate change, resource depletion, land de- gradation, food insecurity and development challenges, an in - tegrative approach is needed to ensure sustainable health. This concept strongly applies to all chronic inflammatory diseases, because of a strong scientific basis of epigenetic regulation of the disease genes with the influ - ence of changing environment. Human health, animal health, plant health, healthy air, water and earth, food safety & secu - rity are integrative components of the \" One Health \" concept. F) A fully integrated World Aller - gy and Asthma Network should be established with all national asthma centers and already es - tablished networks, alliances, societies, academies aiming at worldwide allergy surveillance, strategy development and ed - ucation. Prioritization of aller - gies should take place more and more in the EU, United Nations, WHO and national political agendas. G) A multidisciplinary and scien - tific approach is essential . 40 scientists and clinicians from all around the world and vari - ous fields of allergy and relat - ed disciplines gathered under the sponsorship of the Chris - tine K\u00fchne - Center for Allergy Research and Education (CK- CARE) for the 2nd Global Aller - gy Forum from 16 to 19 June 2013 in Davos, Switzerland. The participants representing major academies and socie - ties formed working groups to discuss the actual most urgent problems. Role of environment, mechanisms of allergic inflam - mation and protection, allergy prevention, allergy diagnosis and therapy as well as educa - tion was particularly focused. In a parallel action that brings together political bodies and scientists, representatives of the European Academy of Al - lergy and Clinical Immunolo - gy, the European Respiratory Society, the International Pri - mary Care Respiratory Group, the Polish Allergy Society, the WHO Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases, and the European Federation of Allergy and Airway Diseases Patients' Associations were in - vited by the Polish Minister of Health to convene and discuss how to prevent and control chronic respiratory diseases in children on Sept 20-21, 2011.

Vision and roadmap to fight with allergiesThe European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) is a non-profit organization active in the field of allergic and immunologic diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, eczema, occupational allergy, food and drug allergy and anaphylaxis. Its scope covers both basic science and clinical medicine. Since its establishment in 1956, EAACI has grown to become the largest medical association in Europe in the field of allergy and clinical immunology. Its membership currently includes nearly 7800 members from 121 countries, representing academicians, clinicians, and allied health professionals. In addition, EAACI includes 47 National Allergy Societies as members. EAACI's mission is to provide the most efficient platform for scientific communication and education in the field of allergy and immunology, ultimately striving to ease the lives of patients suffering from these diseases. EAACI is regarded as the primary source of expertise in Europe for all aspects of allergy. EAACI's activities Fostering science through dedicated platforms Annual Congress, Focused Meetings, Guidelines and Position Papers Educating professionals (Allergy Schools; CME system; knowledge examination in allergy and clinical Immunology; Research and Clinical Fellowships) Disseminating knowledge through EAACI Journals (Allergy, Pediatric Allergy Immunology, Clinical and Translational Allergy, EAACI Newletter) and online communication platforms Advocating change and raising awareness among the European Union's decision makers about the importance of allergy and clinical immunology and the opportunities to prevent and treat allergies through Public Campaigns and Public DeclarationsAllergy today is a global public health concern of pandemic proportions and it requires immediate action. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology called on all worldwide leaders to develop the \"Global Atlas of Allergy\" . The \"Atlas\" was written by an international group of 183 World leaders in allergy and asthma research and is aimed to highlight the burden of allergic diseases worldwide as of sufficient magnitude to warrant recognition as a priority in national health strategies; to describe mechanisms and risk factors and evaluate the best ways to prevent and control allergic diseases, to provide guidance on how to overcome barriers ahead such as poverty, poor education and infrastructure, low public health priority due to the importance of other illnesses and the lack of good worldwide valid epidemiologic data; to ensure that cost-effective management approaches, which have been proven to reduce morbidity and mortality are available to as many persons as possible with allergic diseases worldwide; to establish an action plan to manage resources for allergic diseases prevention and to prioritise funding for allergy research. A \"Global Allergy fight Strategy\" should be developed, involving all stakeholders and targeting all aspects from optimal patient care and access to diagnosis and essential drug to innovative pathways for disease prevention and future drug discovery.
