In March 2020, more than 80,000 infections and 3,000 deaths were reported in China. COVID -19 became pandemic by spreading to numerous countries including the United States, Germany, Italy, Spain, Iran, Japan, Korea and more . By April 2020, the global inf ection rate was reported at 870,000 with 43,000 deaths2. In June 2020, approximately 10 million infection were estimated with 500,000 deaths caused by COVID -193. SARS -CoV-2 belongs to the virus family Coronaviridae (betacoronavirus taxon, or type II coronaviruses)4 and is commonly known to be pathogenic to humans upon infection5. Alphacoronavirus and most betacoronavirus infections manifest with symptoms similar to the common cold6. However, SARS -CoV-2 infection exerts an elevated path ology, manifesting as a severe atypical pneumonia, fever, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and potentially patient death . SARS -CoV-1 was initially identified and characterized as a novel coronavirus causing ARDS in 20037-9. Efforts have been made to develop therapeutic and prophylactic interventions. However, all efforts were retired in 2007 when the virus was eradicated from the human population by non - pharmaceutical interv entions2. None of the vaccines had gone past cl inical testing phase I2. Currently, therapeutics and vaccines against SARS -CoV-2 are not available but are critically needed. Since the initial discovery of SARS -CoV-1 in 2003, a repertoire of vaccination approaches underwent preclinical and clinica l testing, ranging from attenuated virus to antigen -encoding nucleic acid sequences , differing in immunogen composition, administration format and route2, 10. Pioneering antigen -specific vaccination studies identified and employed the spike protein , which was administered encoded by nucleic acid sequence , to serve as a promising immunizing antigen11. The spike transmembrane glycoprotein, an immunologically unique integral SARS - CoV-1 and SARS -CoV-2 protein, consists of an extracellularly exposed N -terminal S1 domain (including a receptor binding domain, RBD) engaging with host receptor ACE2 in humans12, followed by a S2 domain mediating virion: host -cell membrane fusion resulting in syncytia formation12, which is associated with aggressive disease progression5, 9. A transmembrane region and an intracellular carboxyterminal cytoplasmic domain complete the spike protein12. In 2004, (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

In 2020, an advanced vaccine candidate employed inactivated SARS -CoV-2 virus acquiring immunization efficacy13. Both studies assess promising humoral as well as adaptive immune responses, which are considered to contribute to successful vaccination and long -term protection . While the primary goal of immunization is the production of antigen - specific antibodies capable of virus neutralization and eliciting protective activity14, the antigen - specific education of the T cell compartment is thought to mount an antiviral response by interferon (IFN) production15. Furthermore, CD4+IFN+ Th1 polarization and matu ration of virus - antigen specific CD8+ T cells contribute to enhanced anti -viral adaptive immune responses. Interestingly, interleukin -6 (IL-6) secretion has been found to be associated with advanced pulmonary pathology in COVID -19 patients16, which draws particular attention to IL -6 circuitry - counteracting IFN responses17 and the importance of an operative adaptive immune response. However, directing an immunization ap proach against COVID -19 to directly target the antigen - presenting cell (APC) compartment, which has been emphasized by Steinman and colleagues to dramatically enhance both, the humoral and adaptive immune response18, remains elusive. Here, we report a unique targeted immunization approach against COVID -19, directly delivering the immunizing S1-Fc antigen to Fc R+ APCs. Our immunization approach focusses on the SARS -CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain serving as the viral antigen. We genetically fused the S1 domain to the Fc moiety of human immunoglobulin APCs, such as dendritic cells and macrophages as well as B cells, where IgG1 - Fc is known to crossreact with murine Fc R19. Targeted immunization with rS1 -Fc protein potentially affords low dose and therefore safe immunization, associated with enhanced desired immune responses18. Immediately after rS1-Fc administration, rS1-Fc homes to the inguinal lymph node where FcR+ APCs reside. Furthermore, rS1-Fc immunization induces rapid seroconversion and mounts a considerably elevated production of S1 -specific antibodies in vivo , indicating a robust S1 -Fc-induced humoral immune response. Interestingly, persistent delivery of S1-Fc by immunization with non -expiring S1 -Fc dsDNA induces a potent adaptive immune immunization -dose -dependent Th1 polarization and CD8+IFN+ effector T cell administration of non-expiring S1 the education of anti -S1 antigen -specific CD8+ T cells. However, in direct comparison, immunization with low -dose recombinant rS1 -Fc protein induces the production of S1 -specific antibodies, exerting considerably elevated neutralization activity against SARS -CoV-2 virus in vitro .

The human immunoglo bulin Fc moiety is thought to engage with Fc R+ expressing cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells , thus, targeting the antigen -presenting cell compartment20. The S1 domain of the SARS -CoV-2 spike protein serves as the immunogenic antigen to mount anti - viral humoral and adaptive immune responses. Upon production of a linear S1 -Fc encoding dsDNA, harboring a constitutively active promoter and a cell secretion sequence ( Fig. 1A ), we assessed S 1-Fc protein secretion by murine muscle cells upon delivery. Linear S1 -Fc encoding dsDNA was internalized immediately upon electroporation by murine fibroblasts and muscle cells with considerably high efficacy as shown by flow cytometry ( Fig. 1B ), which co 1C ). Subsequently, critical secretion of S1 -Fc protein, which is thought to serve as the immunizing antigen, was detected in muscle cell culture supernatant (Fig. 1D ). Notably, S1 -Fc protein was detected in the biceps femoris muscle 44 days after administration , which is indicative of continuous non -exhausting S1 -Fc protein de novo synthesis and S1 ( Supplemental Fig. 1A ). Moreover, S1 -Fc protein was internalized by dendritic cell species in biceps femoris , suggesting operative targeting of the Fc R+ APC compartment (Supplemental Fig. 1 B). Recombinant rS1 -Fc protein chimera was produced in CHO cells and subjected to analytical size - exclusion chromatography showing a distinct elution of rS1 -Fc monomer (84.5%). self -assembled (rS1 -Fc) n aggregate (Supplemental Fig. 2A) which might by owed to intrinsic oligo merizati on activity of the SARS -CoV-2 spike gel electrophoretic analysis showed reduced rS1 -Fc aggregation activity in production ( Supplemental 2B). rS1 -Fc immunologic identity was validated by immunodetection of Western blotting procedure ( Fig. 2A). is readily murine RAW264.7 macrophages in vitro (Fig. 2B) and can be found throughout the cell cytoplasm as well as the cell nucleus as demonstrated by confocal laser - scanning microscopy ( Fig. 2C). Importantly, rS1 -Fc engages with ACE2 as assessed by ELISA (Fig. 2D). The S1 domain of the SARS -CoV-2 spike protein binding to host receptor ACE2 was emphasized to contribute critically to the initiation of hos t cell infection12. However, rS1 -Fc binding to ACE2 indicates operative functionality, and furthermore , binding represents a decoy activity by latent competi tion with viral spike protein for ACE2 binding , potentially reducing host cell virus susceptibility . Moreover, targeted delivery of rS1 -Fc to the APC compartment is thought to be (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Homing to the lymph node critically enhances the exposure of rS1-Fc to FcR expressing APCs and favors its cellula and intended processing. Interestingly, S1 -protein+ splenic APCs were observed 44 days rS1 -Fc (Fig. B cells, readily internalize rS1 -Fc within 30 min as assessed by flow cytometric analysis ( Fig. 3A ). Notably, prolonged exposure of splenic APCs to rS1 -Fc did not result in increased cellular load, which is su ggesting a cytologic limitation in antigen uptake. However, blocking CD16/32+ FcR resulted in considerably reduced rS1 -Fc cellular internalization, functional targeting of R+ compartment ( S1 -Fc or into the biceps femoris intramuscularly. Repeated \"boosting\" immunization was scheduled at day 21 after initial immunization administration. Blood serum of immunized m ice was collected weekly to facilitate monitoring of anticipated immune responses ( Fig. 4A ). Immunization of mice with linearized dsDNA S1 -Fc mounted a significant and robust CD4+IFN+ Th1 polarization in vivo in a 4B ). Moreover, S1 -antigen specific CD8+ T cells isolated from spleen accumulated upon immunization at increased dose (Fig. 4C ). Furthermore, high dose immunization favored CD8+IFN+ effector T cell in vivo education in a d ose-dependent manner ( Fig. 4D ). Thus, dose -dependent adaptive responses administration of non -expiring S1 -Fc dsDNA indicate -expiring S1 -Fc dsDNA is required to elicit a desired adaptive T cell immune response, continuously feeding S1 -antigen systemically. In turn, the humoral B cell immune response is sensitive to reduced immunization doses. Complete seroconversion is detectable at day 10 upon initial immunization with both, 50 g and 20 g of administ ered non -expiring non -expiring S1 -Fc dsDNA did not suffice to induce a of S1 -specific serum IgG antibodies (Fig. 4E recombinant rS1 -Fc facilitated accelerated seroconversion detectable at day 7, mounting considerably incre ased levels of S1 - S1 -specific serum IgG antibodies in vivo experiences a decrease at day 24, which might be owed to the anticipated feedback inhibit ion loop mediated (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

However, upon administration of a repeated \"boosting\" immunization at day 21, S1 -specific serum IgG antibody production recovered by day 28 resulting in considerably elevated and higher anti-S1 IgG serum for anti -S1 significantly reduced the interaction of the viral S1 -domain and host receptor ACE2 at high dilution, indicating production of a highly potent anti -S1 IgG serum antibody population induced by rS1 -Fc Fig. 4G ). seropositive for - S1 IgG elicits protection against live SARS -CoV-2 infection in a stringent experimental virus challenge assay. However, although continuous S1 -Fc expression and antigen production is facilitated by immunization with non -expiring S1 -Fc-encoding dsDNA, we observed that non -expiring S1 -Fc-encoding dsDNA elicits protection up to 50% only. In contrast, low -dose immunization with recombinant rS1 -Fc administered intramuscularly mounted considerable increased protection 4H ). Interestingly, routing rS1 -Fc administration via intravenous injection resulted in a similar protection efficacy (77.7%) , indicating that rS1 -Fc immunization propagates a robust humoral immune response. Hence, immunization against SARS -CoV-2 employing rS1 -Fc protein unfolds rapid seroconversion and production of anti-S1-specific IgG eliciting protection capacity.

S1 -Fc immunization triggers rapid seroconversion, resulting in considerably elevated production of S1 -specific antibodies in vivo . Furthermore, immunization with recombinant rS1 -Fc protein improv es the inhibitory activity of anti -S1 IgG antibodies, protecting from live SARS -Cov.2 infection in vitro . Interestingly, the education of an S1-antigen specific adaptive immune response is highly dose -sensitive. At high -dose immunization using non -expiring S1-Fc-encoding dsDNA we demonstrate the desired Th1 polarization and effector CD8+IFN+ T cell maturation. Moreover, immunization S1 -Fc-encoding dsDNA mounts S1-antigen specific CD 8+ T cell education, which remained undetectab le using low -dose immunization with rS1 -Fc. Immunization dose -sensitivity shaping the adaptive immune response sheds light on potentially required elevated doses and/or an increased dose frequency for improved adaptive immune responses. Impressive results were reported in a recent preclinical study, employing the full -length S glycoprotein of SARS -CoV-2 as immunogen , encoded and administered as plasmid DNA26, a conceptually very similar approach reported by Nabel and colleagues in 200411. The bacterial plasmid DNA encoding full -length spike protein, regulated by a constitutively active cytomegalovirus (CMV) administe red by electroporation, an anti -SARS -CoV- 2 but not anti -SARS or anti -MERS IFN T cell response, and the humoral immune response mounts serum IgG exerting neutralization activity upon a single administration of bacterial plasmid DNA encoding full -length spike protein26. However, immunization introducing double -stranded, single -stranded DNA or RNA species including plasmids, inevitably raises the concern of an undesired Toll -like receptor (TLR) response, mediating uncontrolled cytokine secretion and potentially resulting in disease - promoting cytokine -release syndrome (CRS) and life -threatening inflammatory responses27, 28. TLRs are known to detect microbial infection extra - and intracellularly29, inducing the activation of an inflamm atory response, including but not restricted to IL -6 production30. Moreover, TLR activation directly or indirectly compromises the functional priming of T cells by a blunted or indolent adaptive immune response, which vice versa insufficiently present s primary (MHC) and secondary (B7.1, B7.2) signals, resulting in propagation of anergic T cell populations31.

An u ndirected/anergic adaptive immune response, the education of inflammatory IL-10 produ cing CD4+ T regulatory cells reducing desired anti -viral CD8+ T cell efficacy, and raising undesired adverse reactions were reported32, 33, abandoning patient safety and is associated with unpredictable prognosis. Hence, the undirected and uncontrolled introduction of a transgene in humans for the purpose of immunization therapy must be considered scientifically premature, requires in depth clinical testing to determine safety exit strategies, and is not fit for delivery to the public at large scales , which are required to control the COVID -19 pandemic. Our ongoing comprehensive studies as well as others26, 32, 33 indicate, that considerable amount s of immunogen are required to achieve education of an IFN+ adaptive immune response. However, low-dose immunization with rS1 -Fc targeting the Fc R+ APC compartment represents an operative imm unization strategy achieving rapid seroconversion and mounting considerably high levels of anti -S1 specific antibodies eliciting protective activity. Further preclinical studies tailored to improve the antigen -specific adaptive immune response in the circu itry of immunization by targeted rS1 -Fc protein are required, guiding us to a mild, safe and protecting targeted rS1 -Fc vaccination against COVID -19.
