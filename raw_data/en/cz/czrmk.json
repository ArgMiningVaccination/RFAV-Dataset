Volume 15, Issue #4 BURZYNSKI'S CANCER REMEDY \"ANTINEOPLASTONS\" Saul Green, PhD, reviews the background of Stanislau Burzynski, his claims, rationale and scientific evidence for his popular questionable cancer remedy known as \"antineoplastons\" (JAMA, 1992;267:2924-28). Green's review is very informative and well-written. It will be of interest to anyone desiring knowledge on this persistently promoted remedy. Addendum: The State of Texas has recently moved to stop the sale of Antineoplastons. Frank Wiewel's People Against Cancer group (originally the IAT Patients Association) is campaigning on Burzynski's behalf. BIOFEEDBACK: HOW VALID IS IT? Biofeedback is a popular psychological treatment for a variety of medical problems. It has been around for sometime and is sometimes equated with behavioral medicine. Alan Roberts, PhD, a researcher who is experienced in the clinical use of biofeedback, wrote a critical review (published in the American Psychologist, 1985;40:938-41). He concluded then that there is little relationship between research findings and clinical practices in the area of biofeedback. Roberts stands by his criticisms of biofeedback today, and feels that the public needs to be made aware that the validity of biofeedback is in question. Roberts' article is very well written and raises questions about the attitude with which researchers and clinicians should approach not just biofeedback, but any behavioral clinical procedure. He describes a movement within clinical psychology \"from the tough minded to the tender minded\" which \"has led to a kind of muddleheadedness, of uncriticalness that does not serve either our profession or our clients well.\" He says that if clinical psychology is not an applied science, it has little more to offer than other groups who simply make people feel better. Comment: Roberts puts his finger on a growing problem in health care which is to aim at patient \"satisfaction\" rather than true effectiveness. There is no doubt that health care providers need to pay attention to satisfying the emotional needs of patients, but this cannot be done at the expense of scientific validity. JAPAN PUBLISHES NCAHF'S ACUPUNCTURE POSITION PAPER NCAHF has been notified by the Division of Information Medicine, Medical Research Institute, of Tokyo Medical and Dental University that its position paper on acupuncture was translated and published in IDO-NO-NIPPON (The Journal of Japanese Acupuncture & Moxibustion). The communication stated that the paper was \"being received with heterogeneous reaction from surprise, anger to agreement and support\" (5/12/92 letter from Kiichiro Tsutani, MD, PhD). PAULING'S FAITH IN VITAMIN C UNDAUNTED BY HIS CANCERLinus Pauling is still a believer in the anti-cancer benefits of vitamin C despite the fact he has been diagnosed with prostatic cancer. He credits his high-C regimen with delaying the disease until his present age of 91. People knowledgeable about the risks of prostate cancer are unlikely to be convinced that Pauling is exceptional. On the contrary, he seems to be well within the range of what can be expected of a white male with a relatively low body weight. BETA-CAROTENE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED CANCER RISK A case-control study comparing 257 women with cervical dysplasia (a pre-cancerous condition) with 705 controls found an increased risk for women with a high intake of beta-carotene (2.31; CI= 1.27-4.19). No relationship was found with retinol intake, while both vitamin C and fiber showed a weak, nonsignificant inverse relationship (De Vet, et al. Internat J Epi, 1991;20:603-10). This is a finding that the public is not likely to hear about since it doesn't favor the interests of the provitamin lobby. NYC CRACKS DOWN ON PHONY NUTRITIONAL SPORTS AIDS The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs has filed legal charges against six manufacturers of nutritional supplements for deceptive advertising in body-building and fitness magazines. Mark Green, Commissioner, stated: \"This industry essentially promotes snake-oil for strongmen and misleads gullible teens who aspire to be the next Arnold Schwartzenegger.\" Green noted that the Federal Trade Commission has taken only one action against such companies in the past 7 years. The companies and products charged were: - Metabolic Nutrition, Inc. of Miami, FL; Opti-Genetics; growth while you sleep\" and \"double triple\" muscle growth. - Cybergenics, a Cybergain, Vortex; claims: \"Single-most intense, and virtually incomparable muscle development ever seen in the history of science and sports.\" - Universal Nutritional Systems, New Brunswick, NJ. Hot Sauce; claim: \"the most efficient muscle-building supplement\" which will allow user to \"watch ... muscles explode with incredible strength, massive size, and pure energy.\" - Champion Nutrition, Concord, CA. Metabolol; claim: \"Nothing more powerful at adding muscle without fat.\" - ROM Research, Baltimore, MD. Ultra Pro. claims: \"incredible muscle gains\" can be achieved with its product and that \"huge gains\" in muscle growth are produced in \"record time.\" Spray; claim \"designed to enhance your body's natural production of testosterone.\" The department's 33-page report, Magic Muscle Pills - Health and Fitness Quackery in Nutrition Supplements is available for $5 per copy. Address: 42 Broadway, NY, 10004. NCAHF's Task Force on Ergogenic Aids is credited in the report. THE CASE AGAINST AMINO ACID SUPPLEMENTS Victor Herbert, MD, JD, presents the medicolegal case against the over-the-counter marketing of free amino acid supplements in \"L-Tryptophan\" (Nutrition Today Mar-Apr, 1992). Most shocking is the revelation that both the FDA and Canada's Food & Drug Directorate declared all amino acids to be non-GRAS (ie, not Generally Recognized As Safe) in 1974. The FDA did not enforce its prohibition on the sale of amino acid supplements while Canada did. The result was that Canada did not experience the epidemic of eosinophilic-myalgia syndrome (EMS) that led to many deaths and chronic disease. Herbert presents a history of how L-tryptophan was clearly marketed as a drug-which provided a cause for action by itself for FDA if it had chosen to act. His analysis of deceptive tactics used by marketers is highly instructional for consumer health educators. Seven potential harms are elucidated which could result from free amino acid supplement use. PATIENT SUES FAITH HEALER WHO DELAYED CANCER CARE Mary E. Turk, 67, of Dallas, Texas, is suing evangelist Robert Tilton for $70 million for delaying her trip to the doctor until it was too late to successfully treat her colon cancer. Three other women have also sued the Tilton ministry and want it shut down. Turk says that she took Tilton at his word that he was a prophet of the Lord and could heal her. She now accuses him of defrauding her. (The Dallas Morning News, 4/7/92) FDA CLINIC RAID PANICS MAVERICK MEDICS' COMMUNITYOn May 8, a frantic plea by Alexander Schauss (see \"Diet & behavior 'expert' fakes his credentials,\" NCAHF Newsletter, Jan-Feb, 1989) went through the communications network of organized \"alternative\" medicine. FDA agents and King County Sheriff's office personnel had raided the Kent, Washington, medical offices of Jonathan Wright, MD, on May 6. The FDA seized illegally imported drugs, unapproved medical devices, and other items at the clinic. Sheriff's officers broke down the door and entered with guns drawn when people inside refused to open the door, which is police policy since emotions can run high at such times and irrational behavior can be anticipated (Schauss claims that no attempt was made to knock on the door). Wright is a celebrity maverick. He is a member, and former chairman, of the Board of Governors of the National Health Federation the leading anti-consumer protection lobbying group in the country. Supporters were asked to FAX White House Chief of Staff, Sam Skinner on Wright's behalf who Schauss said had dedicated a special FAX line to receive details on this raid. [Note: NCAHF responded by faxing Skinner the message that the FDA has been criticized by Congress for lack of enforcement, and should not be interfered with now that it is doing its job. The case should stand on its own merit and not be politically fixed. Further, we pointed out that the influx of mail should be interpreted as an indication of just how large and well-organized quackery has become.] The \"medical freedom\" advocates have made an issue of the guns drawn aspect of the raid and have managed to attract some media attention. Paul Harvey covered the incident in a way sympathetic to Wright. [Harvey also wrote against FDA regulation of vitamins in his newspaper column, and advertises health food products (eg, Kyolic garlic), which reveals his biases. (FYI: the Paul Harvey listed on the NHF Board of Governors is not the radio commentator.)] Comment: The Wright affair has called attention to the \"alternative\" medicine community in western Washington. On June 8, NCAHF President Dr. William Jarvis, was called to KING-TV in Seattle for a taped interview on the matter. Dr. Herbert provided input by satellite. A key part of Wright's practice employs a device called the Computron, a galvanic device much like the Dermatron, Interro, Vega, and others, which measure electrical resistance on the skin. Readings are greatly effected by the amount of pressure on the probe, skin moisture and how long they are held in place. A unique feature of the Computron is a metal plate set in line which functions like the \"well\" on a radionics device. Substances which correspond to extracts given as drops on the patients' tongues are placed on the plate to test electronically for \"allergies\" (actually, ill-defined maladies that appear to be neurotic disorders). Wright was back in business soon after and appeared to be enjoying the attention. NIH WEIGHT-LOSS CONFERENCE A panel convened by the National Institutes of Health to evaluate voluntary weight loss and control issued a sobering message for people and commercial entities involved in weight loss. Frances Berg, coordinator of NCAHF's Task Force on Unsound Weight Loss summarized 15 of the panel's findings in the May-June issue of Obesity and Health. These points form the basis of sound consumer health education on this important topic. Comment: Given the amount of advertising by commercial diet programs that consumers are exposed to, weight loss looms as probably the most unfulfilled in terms of expectations and results. A VOICE OF REASON ON THE ENVIRONMENT Dixie Lee Ray, PhD, former governor of Washington, long known for her eloquent rationalism, puts the facts to the popular scare stories that drive environmental politics these days. Her article, \"Are the global threats real? Scientific Facts vs. Environmental Myths\" (Priorities, Spring, 1992) is a welcome relief from the hysteria that Americans are regularly treated to by the both the popular and elitist media (ie, public broadcasting). Ray deals with alleged global warming, carbon dioxide increase, and stratospheric ozone. In a nutshell, records taken over the past century show no increase in air or ocean temperatures. Atmospheric CO2 levels are only modestly effected by humans, and plants adjust by taking in more CO2 when it is available. The hole in the ozone layer is based upon observations too limited and recent to know if it is abnormal or part of a normal cycle. Further, it has not been proved that freons produce the chloride ions believed to deplete the ozone layer, nevertheless, the refrigeration industry is being required to phase freon out (freon is considered a boon to safety by refriger-ation people who once had to use dangerous gases such as ammonia). Politics, not science, is driving environmentalism. Every citizen should read Ray's article. Comment: The doomsayers argue that the survival of the planet is too important to wait for the scientific evidence. They seem unaware that public health, economics and the standard of living that has meant record longevity for Americans is inextricably tied to the environment that technology has produced. All of us want to save the wild places and improve our environment by reducing pollution, but this can only be done effectively when we have the facts. Creating enviromental scapegoats and killing them off just to assuage our paranoia is useless at best and can be destructive. These issues are important to NCAHF because piggy-backing on environmental hysteria are organic farming, supplement promotions, health foods, anti-medical research animal rights, clinical ecology, and more from the wonderful world of quackery. COLORADO RN CONFRONTS PSEUDOSCIENCE IN NURSES CONTINUING EDUCATION The Colorado Board of Nursing (CBN) mandates a minimum of 20 hours of continuing education (CE) credit every two years for RNs and LPNs. The purpose of CE presumably is to bring practitioners up-to-date with the rapidly developing science and technology of their fields. However, CE has become the vehicle through which nonscientific practices are proliferated. Topics approved for CE in Colorado include Reflexology, Applied Kinesiology, Life Energy Balancing, Healing Colors, Aromatherapy, firewalking, Acupressure, and Therapeutic Touch which is the most popular. Such courses are usually justified as part of the art of patient care (ie, meeting patients' emotional needs). Art is important, but must be differentiated from the scientific aspects of care. Any procedure aimed at preventing, alleviating or curing a disease should meet scientific standards of safety and effectiveness. With tongue-in-cheek humor, Linda Rojas, RN (Rocky Mt Skeptic, Mar-Apr, 1992), describes a heart attack victim in front of a nurses convention who is set upon by nurses plying the techniques they have learned in CE. Some wave their hands over the victim (Therapeutic Touch), another grabs your pinky finger and pushes on your tailbone (acupressure), another flashes angel and animal guide cards (shamanism), others use crystals and colored lights. She also describes nurses as tending to be religious and superstitious in their eagerness to help patients, as well as poorly trained in statistical analysis and the scientific method. The CBN uses only mundane criteria such as having written learning objectives, questions, and handout materials with no attention to scientific validity of course content. Further, there are no caveats issued to CE students that a buyer beware situation exists for nursing CE. Rojas points out that CE ultimately affects nursing care which makes quality control within CE a consumer issue. Rojas presented a written statement before the CBN which pointed out the importance of quality nursing care and asked for a an explanation as to how quality control was being done to assure valid CE coursework, and how the CBN viewed its accountability in this matter. The CBN decided to review the appropriateness of TT. At its May 28-9 meeting, it voted to continue awarding CE credit to TT and to review other courses on a case-by-case basis (letter dated 6/8/92). CHIROS BLAMED FOR WORKERS' COMPENSATION COST PROBLEMS Florida workers' compensation officials are complaining bitterly about abuses by chiropractors, according to the cover story of Florida Trend (\"The manipulators,\" June, '92). A spokesman for the American Insurance Association says that he thinks of workers comp as \"the chiropractic full-employment act!\" Although DC care accounts for only 6% of the $1.25 billion spent annually on Florida's workers comp, it is singled out as the most egregious example of abuse. Over utilization, over diagnosis, and sweetheart relationships with unscrupulous attorneys are the problems. It was even proposed that DCs be kicked out of the system, but was decided that this could not be done. The only hope seems to lie within the chiro guild itself. Comment: Little wonder that DCs are so good at ripping off the system. NCAHF has obtained a success school manual that teaches DCs how to milk insurance companies. If it were not for the honest DCs who are doing insurance reviews there would be little hope for improvement. NCAHF's DC advisors say that most state licensing boards back their constituents in disputes against insurance companies even when the claims are poorly documented and unjustified. A curious aspect of this report is that DC propagandists have bragged about their performance in Florida in chiropractic advertising promotions. THE \"DOCTOR FEEL-GOOD\" APPROACH TO QUACKERY Health-conscious people generally reject drugs as incompatible with a healthy lifestyle, but seekers of superhealth are being fooled by herbal drug pushers. A study of health practices and beliefs revealed that people do not differentiate between symptomatic relief and truly effective remedies. [National Analysts, Inc. A Study of Health Practices and Opinions. Springfield, VA: National Technical Information Service, 1972] Subjectively feeling good is the gauge many use to evaluate whether a practice is good or bad. Giving hidden mood-modifying substances to convince customers that they are experiencing superhealth is known as the \"Dr. Feel Good\" approach to quackery. The Dr. Feel Good approach was well-known to patent medicine promoters during the golden age of quackery. These medicines merely masked the effects of disease without having a material effect upon the condition. Prior to the 1906 Pure Food & Drug Act people did not know that the \"secret ingredients\" they were ingesting could be opiates, cocaine, strychnine, arsenic or other drugs. The 1911 Harrison Narcotics Act controlled many of these substances. History is being repeated in many of today's herbal promotions. The same study revealed that very large numbers of people mistakenly believe that it is possible to gain noticeable improvements in vigor and energy by improving one's diet or using supplements. In reality, eating properly will not give normal, healthy people a \"high.\" The misbelief that nutrition can supply vigor and energy is where the herbal quacks find their openings. Stimulating drugs can pep people up and depressants can alter a person's mood and create the illusion of a health benefit. Many popular herbal products contain potent stimulant drugs which are unrecognized by consumers because the products are sold as \"foods.\" One popular herb, guarana (street marketed as Zoom \u2014 a legal stimulant and cocaine substitute), contains a potent dose of caffeine. An even more powerful stimulant being used more and more by herbal drug pushers is ephedrine. To prevent drug merchants from converting the easy-to-obtain ephedrine to methamphetamine, Nevada placed ephedrine on its list of controlled substances in 1991. This caused an outcry by users, many of whom were late night casino workers who used the drug to stay alert. In 1988, the U.S. judo champion who had been using the Sunrider product, Vitalite, which depends upon ephedrine for its lift, was disqualified from the Olympic trials when traces of ephedrine were found in his urine. More recently, a line called Lite Rite (aka, Thinergy) herbs has contained ephedrine dubbed \"epitonin.\" Consumers are being fooled into taking drugs by sanitizing them by calling them \"herbs.\" The Dr. Feel Good approach to quackery is also employed in giving coffee enemas. Caffeine is absorbed through the gut wall giving the patient a real high. The high is misinterpreted as an improvement in health and well-being. Rebound lows are (mis)interpreted as \"the poisons coming out.\" Again, an important study found that people must rely upon others to interpret the feelings they experience from drugs, and the Dr. Feel Good approach provides quacks with the opportunity to do just that. The next time you hear someone extolling the zip they are getting from their favorite herbal product, don't presume that it is simply the placebo effect. Although the placebo effect is undoubtedly part of the picture (as is the enthusiasm of being a salesperson if one is confronting a multilevel distributor), but do not overlook the fact that herbs are potent sources of mood-modifying drugs that can be used as Dr. Feel Good schemes. Feel good herbs include: ginseng, broom, mate, lettuce opium, lobelia, valerian, and others. LETTER TO HOFFMAN-LA ROCHE CEO SAYS IT WELL (Hoffman-LaRoche is the world's largest vitamin producer.) Mr. Irwin Lerner, President and CEO May 16, 1992 Hoffman-LaRoche 340 Kingsland St. Nutley, NJ 07110 Dear Mr. Lerner: A quote in the latest issue of Nutrition Forum attributed to your Mr. Anthony Iannarone is, if accurate, the most appalling and cynical comment that I have ever encountered from anyone in the legitimate health care industry. He is quoted as saying in part \" ...neither government agencies nor industry, including the supplement industry, should be protecting people from their own stupidity.\" When the supplement industry, through its own attempts (mostly via advertisements) consciously and intentionally fosters and perpetuates that \"stupidity\" by undertaking to convince the public at large, most of whom have little or no knowledge of nutrition science, that they are in fact poorly nourished, and then has the audacity to call us stupid, there is a definite problem of ethics . . . An instance of this sort originating from an illegitimate source such as a \"health food\" company is bad enough, but when a supposedly ethical firm like Hoffman-La Roche is guilty of such cynicism, lack of tact and disdain for public at large is inexcusable. . . . .If his statement is representative of corporate thought and policy, I believe it is time for you and your board of directors and company officers to consider some major changes in your policies and attitudes. Yours truly, Kurt Youngmann Highland Park, IL [Hide Full Content](#twenty-nine-thousand-eight-hundred-nineteen) [NCRHI News, September/October 1999](https://quackwatch.org/ncahf/9-10-3/) Volume 22, Issue #5 PRODUCT GLUT MAY SPELL TROUBLE FOR SUPPLEMENT HUCKSTERS New Rochelle, NY 8/23/99, PRNewswire.

Volume 22, Issue #5 PRODUCT GLUT MAY SPELL TROUBLE FOR SUPPLEMENT HUCKSTERS New Rochelle, NY 8/23/99, PRNewswire. The acquisition of General Nutrition Companies (GNCI) by Royal Numico, N.V. this month could be the start of a far-reaching consolidation in the troubled nutritional and natural products industry, according to the inaugural issue of NutriBiz, published by Corporate Research Group. Midsized firms with revenues of $100 million to $750 million, such as Rexall Sundown, Twinlab, Nutraceutical International, NBTY/Nature's Bounty and Weider Nutrition, are possible acquisition candidates, given the generally low valuations accorded to nutrition and natural products companies, say analysts quoted in NutriBiz. NutriBiz reports that a product glut at retail has led to disappointing sales and earnings for a number of industry leaders, with nutrition stocks badly lagging the overall market. Second quarter earnings for 30 companies fell 16%, NutriBiz says. Market valuations for 30 leading companies were down 11% through June to $10.9 billion, and valuations fell another 4.3% in July, the newsletter says. The August issue of NutriBiz also covers: - the battle for leadership in the $500 million energy bar market between PowerBar, Balance Bar, Clif Bar and others; - how cholesterol-lowering spreads from Johnson & Johnson and Lipton are faring with consumers; - what fast-growing Experimental & Applied Sciences is doing about its hot-selling androstenedione product, now that a scientific study (funded by EAS) casts doubt on the product's benefits. Home run leader Mark McGwire said this month he is no longer taking androstenedione; and, - how retailers like Albertson's, Rite Aid and Kmart are increasing shelfspace or stepping up promotion efforts for their vitamins and herbals sections. MANNATECH SAYS IT WAS MISLED BY DOCTOR \u00a91999 LP Bloomberg with permission. On August 20, 1999 Mannatech Inc. said it has cut all ties to the California physician who wrote a now discredited medical journal article used by the nutritional supplements company to sell its pills. It now says Dr. Darryl See, the article's author, backed his claims with false documents, and that it's considering a lawsuit against him. See's study ranked Mannatech's pills, including its flagship Ambrotose, in the top five of 196 nutritional supplements tested. A company investigation confirmed a Bloomberg News report that See's study was neither funded by the National Institutes of Health nor conducted under the auspices of the University of California at Irvine medical school, as it claimed. \"We have disassociated ourselves completely and unequivocally from Dr. See,\" said Samuel Caster, Mannatech's president. \"Unfortunately, Dr. See misrepresented himself and his work.\" Mannatech also quoted from a Bloomberg News report in which Marikel Chatard, the technician who See said did most of the lab tests for the study, denied participating in it. The company said it verified Dr. See's claims before using the his study. \"We did everything we possibly could to ensure the material was authentic,\" Caster added. That included paying $30,000 for an audit of See's study, which it previously used to defend it. Bloomberg News reported that See never provided the laboratory notebooks requested by the auditor to authenticate his data. Mannatech still hasn't disclosed that it paid See more than $100,000 to speak at sale rallies and conduct research, and that his wife has been a Mannatech distributor since 1997, as See told Bloomberg in an interview. Mannatech sells its pills through an army of more than 400,000 distributors. Company executives weren't available for comment. See resigned from the university's faculty after an investigation censured him for violating research rules, including falsifying documents and conducting laboratory experiments on a rabbit without sufficient anesthesia. The Journal of the American Nutraceutical Association, which published See's article, has stopped selling reprints of See's articles, books and videotapes. See recommends Mannatech's supplements for treatment of diseases such as AIDS and cancer in an audio cassette distributed by Mannatech. On Friday, Bloomberg News reported the NIH is investigating Mannatech's relationship with Dr. Robert Ortmann, one of its scientists who is also a part-time Mannatech salesman. The agency ordered him not to appear at a company sales rally tomorrow in Olympia, Washington. Coppell, Texas-based Mannatech shares today fell 1/16 to 7 7/8. They've lost one-third of their value this month. BENEFIT/RISK OF NECK MANIPULATION An assessment of the benefits and risks of manipulation of the cervical spine (MCS) was done based upon a review of the literature (1925-1997); 177 injuries were reported in 116 articles. The majority of injuries were attributed to manipulation by chiropractors. Physical Therapists (PTs) were involved in less than 2% of reports. The author determined that the best estimate of benefit from MCS was 13-16% decrease in pain; a range of risk estimates for severe neurovascular compromise of from 1-in-50,000 to 1-in- 5 million; the risk of minor exacerbation of neck pain per physical therapist manipulation in New Zealand was 0.21%. There is no evidence that MCS achieved better clinical outcomes than mobilization. [Di Fabio RP. \"Manipulation of the cervical spine: risks and benefits,\" Physical Therapy, 1999;79(1):50-65] HISTORICAL OBSERVATION ABOUT ASTROLOGY Boston Globe, 7/26/99 p.C2 Recently, an astronomer at the Lick Observatory in California found in the institution's library a horoscope cast by the 17th-century astronomer Johannes Kepler for an Austrian nobleman, Hans Hannibal Huetter von Huetterhofen. The document had been purchased in Russia in 1886 by the first director of the Lick Observatory and had lain forgotten for a century. Present-day astrologers always drag out poor Kepler in support of their bogus craft. See, they say, even such an eminent scientist as Kepler was a believer. Kepler practiced astrology only as a matter of financial necessity. His heart certainly wasn't in it. He wrote: \"A mind accustomed to mathematical deduction, when confronted with the faulty foundations [of astrology], resists a long, long time, like an obstinate mule, until compelled by beating and curses to put its foot into that dirty puddle.\" Kepler's distrust of the \"dirty puddle\" hasn't rubbed off on Americans. Polls show that half of Americans are open to astrological influences in their lives. Most newspapers and magazines offer horoscopes. Even those people who say \"Oh, I just do it for fun\" will sometimes admit that \"Well, maybe there's something to it.\" \"After all,\" they say, \"science doesn't know everything. Maybe, just maybe, the positions of the planets and stars do affect out lives. Haven't people believed it for thousands of years? Didn't Kepler believe it? I may not be able to prove it is true, but neither can science prove it is wrong.\" And, of course, they are right. Science can't prove that astrology is wrong because the whole system is so slippery and vague that it's impossible to get a grip on it. That's what Kepler meant by \"dirty puddle.\" A typical horoscope is loose enough to let almost anyone see themselves in it. Whatever Kepler gave Hans Hannibal Huetter von Huetterhofen, we can be confident that his customer went away thinking he got his money's worth. It was the genius of the British philosopher Karl Popper to realize that nothing in science can ever be proved absolutely true. Just because something \"works,\" doesn't mean it's right. But what we can sometimes do with confidence is show that a scientific idea is wrong. As Popper said, good science is \"falsifiable.\" An idea that offers ample opportunities for falsification, yet resists refutation, is to be valued highly. An idea that can't be proved wrong is simply not science. When Kepler discovered what we now call Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion, he found precise mathematical formulae that describe the motions of the planets and their moons to a high degree of precision. A single unambiguous exception to the laws would show that something is amiss. Four hundred years later we have not found an exception. But when Kepler cast horoscopes, it was a \"well, maybe\" sort of thing. Since the 1950s, many scientific studies have attempted to assess the accuracy of astrological predictions, usually by asking astrologers to match horoscopes to people in blind tests. The results have been overwhelmingly negative. In spite of hundreds of person-years of research, not one shred of reliable evidence has emerged to show that astrology is anything but bunk. Do astrologers therefore concede that their horoscopes are a swindle? Not on your life. The system is much too elastic for that. Psychologist Ivan Kelly of the University of Saskatchewan lists a number of ways astrologers get around the scientific critique of their craft: - Ignore bad news. Kelly quotes several astrologers who take this tack, including John Anthony West in his book The Case for Astrology: \"Since the aim of this book is to present the positive evidence, intimate details of the bulk of the negative evidence do not concern us.\" This has been the dominant response of the astrological community. - Knock science. Astrologer Robert Hand writes: \"I don't think that science is yet capable of dealing with the full complexity of the symbolic language as employed by astrologers.\" - Move the goal posts. There are so many different ways of doing astrology that if a scientific study debunks one method, the astrologer simply invokes another. - Invoke negatives. The phenomena of astrology are subtle and elusive and require more creative ways of investigating them than have yet been mustered, say astrologers. Kelly quotes a professional astrologer who admits the absence of scientific evidence for astrology - so far: \"I am personally still convinced that, given more sensitive and imaginative tests, confirmation of the reality of sun-sign typologies, and the signs generally, will be obtained.\" - Blame Faulty Methods. Astrologer West, for example, says that scientific criticism of astrology is irrelevant because astrology is a \"system of magic,\" where magic is \"the attempt to master fundamental laws of resonance that have produced the cosmos.\" In other words, the practice of astrology is so slippery and ambiguous that it cannot be falsified. That is why it continues to flourish in spite of failing every scientific test. And that is why astrology is different than science.

The researcher, Robert P. Liburdy, formerly of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in California, has agreed to ask the journals to retract the results. \"There's a lot of acrimony in the EMF debate, and this won't calm things dawn,\" says Richard G. Stevens, a cancer epidemiologist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Hanford' Washington. Liburdy's findings were among the first to offer a plausible mechanism for a possible link between EMF exposure and cancer or other diseases. In a pair of 1992 papers of which he is the sole author, Liburdy offered evidence that EMFs increase the flow of calcium into Lymphocytes, a kind of immune cell produced in the thymus. The papers created a stir, as calcium ions signal cells to turn genes on and off, and play a role in cell division. Because tumor growth is tied to cell proliferation, an alteration in calcium signaling could conceivably lead to cancer. But in an analysis obtained by Science, ORI states that \"Liburdy's claims that EMF causes cellular effects related to calcium signaling [in three figures in the two journal articles] are not supported by the primary data.\" Responding to an unknown whistle blower's allegations of scientific misconduct bv Liburdy, LBNL in January 1995 appointed a panel of four lab scientists to investigate. After scientists, the panel concluded in a July 1995 report that Liburdy \"deliberately created 'artificial' data where no such data existed\" in a figure in FEBS Letters. In addition, it found, he fabricated data noise for a figure in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences \"in order to mislead the reader.\" These actions, the panel stated \"fall within the definition of scientific misconduct \" When contacted by Science, LBNL officials declined to comment, other than to confirm that Liburdy no longer works at the lab. Because Liburdy had been awarded more than $3.3 million in federal grants for his EMF research, ORI launched a formal review of LBML's report in fall 1997. ORI approved a request by Liburdy for an interview with ORI staff and two outside experts, which took place in March 1998. At the meeting, Liburdy produced original data he had not shared with LBNL investigators, according to the ORI report. But the data failed to exculpate him In its analysis, ORI accuses Liburdy of having lied to LBNL and ORI investigators, and it \"concurs with [LBNL's] findings of scientific misconduct.\" \"Some of the numbers, essentially, he made up,\" says John Krueger, an ORI investigator involved in the case. In a May 1999 agreement signed by Liburdy and OR] acting director Chris Pascal, Liburdy agreed to retract the tainted figures in the two papers and not to receive federal funds for 3 years. He \"neither admits nor denies ORl's findings of scientific misconduct,\" the document states. Liburdy did not respond to requests for an interview. The misconduct findings are unlikely to shift the playing field in EMF research. Since 1992, 20 to 30 scientific papers have looked at EMF exposures and calcium signaling, without settling the issue, says Christopher Portier, associate director of the environmental toxicology program at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences NIEHS). In a report to Congress released on 1: June, NIEHS director Kenneth Olden states the scientific evidence that EMF exposures \"pose any health risk is weak\" and that mechanistic and toxicology studies \"fail to demonstrate any consistent pattem.\" The day before the report came out, National Institutes of Health officials had asked NIEHS to determine quickly whether any of Liburdy's research had influenced the report's conclusions, Portier says. The truth was simple, he says: \"It had no impact whatsoever.\" [Vergano D. Data,\" I am a pathologist, board-certified in both anatomic and clinical pathology. I operate the world's largest public pathology site, which includes a free personalized help line. I have received about ten inquiries in the past few years about the \"anti-malignin antibody in serum\" blood test (AMAS). This is said to be an extremely accurate way of determining whether cancer is present somewhere in the body. This is every pathologist's dream. As its proponents point out, such an assay could replace the current methods of cancer screening, and would render most biopsies and other invasive studies unnecessary. \"Anti-malignin antibody\" has been promoted as such for over twenty years by a single husband-wife team, with occasional brief reports in the medical literature. The team operates the only lab which offers the test. They claim to assay for a substance called \"malignin\", and for antibodies against it. Unlike other independent medical thinkers, the team is not presenting a mysterious, arcane, or secret substance. They claim instead that it's a tumor antigen, like many others that are known \u2014 except that it is ubiquitous among malignant cells and distinguishes them from their benign counterparts. They have conducted themselves decently, and obviously believe in their test. The team is the only group offering the assay. There is an Italian report, not from the main group, but in the obscure International Journal of Biological Markers from 1997 which I presently have on order. The promoter's website states that Smith-Kline labs also did the test and published results in symposium proceedings in 1983, though nothing in the refereed scientific literature. That's all. The wording of the claims for \"anti-malignin antibody\" never actually say that a person can forego pap smears, mammography, or biopsy of suspicious lesions. But some of the test's proponents suggest that this is possible, and this makes me worry about a public health hazard. I have no first-hand knowledge of the team that offers the test, and am relying (as is the norm in real science) on publications. According to the 1999 AMA directory, he is boarded in neurology-psychiatry, but practicing immunology and oncology. She is listed as practicing psychiatry and \"other\", and as unboarded. He also made some contributions in mainstream neurochemistry before 1980, and has a recent publication on virus receptors and dementia in a theme issue of Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. Except as noted, after over 20 years, no other group has published in the refereed literature on \"malignin\" or given any independent evidence that the substance actually exists. (Nor has anybody reported being able to confirm the existence of \"astrocytin,\" another substance which the same team claimed to have discovered at the same time as \"malignin\".) Again, I have no personal experience either with this supposed substance or with the people who describe it. But I am familiar with assays and procedures of the kinds described in their publications. The account of the origin of \"malignin\" is itself curious. According to one source linked below, the principal proponent of the test \"discovered that the outer coating on cancer cells contain [sic] sugar molecules over an inner layer of protein (glycoproteins). Cancer cells bump into each other and the outer layer is ground off \u2014 exposing the inner protein layer and the malignin antigen.\" I've spend a good amount of my life looking at cancer cells. This business about them bumping into each other just isn't true, especially in the early stages. In fact, they're no more mobile than the surrounding cells, and much less mobile than the benign cells of the bloodstream, bone marrow, or lymphoid organs, where collisions among cells happen constantly. At another site, there is a more sophisticated-sounding account. \"Early in the process of malignant transformation, there is a 50% loss in the amount and heterogeneity of the carbohydrate constituents of the cell membrane glycoprotein GlycolOB which results in the appearance of peptide epitopes (malignin) in AglycolOB.\" Visitors should know that the claim that there is a 50% loss of carbohydrate content and heterogeneity in the cell membrane when a cells turns cancerous is unsubstantiated at best, and... a \"Medline\" search over the refereed literature shows no other mention of either GlycolOB or AglycolOB. If the author is referring to OB, the leptin receptor (an appetite regulator), the above account makes no sense. I am presently tracking down all of the team's publications. Except for three letters to Lancet, they are in obscure medical journals. I was startled, though, by the Lancet letter from July 18, 1981. Pathologists routinely use antibodies as stains to identify particular types of cells. In fact, anti-malignin antibody is promoted to the public as a way for pathologists to distinguish benign from malignant cells under the microscope. The \"Lancet\" letter announces the use of anti-malignin antibody as a stain, and the fact that it successfully stained three different types of cancer cells in wet preparations. But what is most curious is that the writer does NOT mention trying out the antibody on any non-cancerous cells. This would be extremely easy to do. If the antibody is really specific for cancer cells, it would leave benign (non-canceous) cells unstained. If the author really believed his own fundamental claim, he would stain sections of tissue containing both benign and malignant cells (i.e., the edges of cancer masses). If he is right, he would see stain only on the cancer cells. After eighteen years, we still have no photos or reports of any such investigations. Even without a blood assay, if the antibody had demonstrated the predicted ability to distinguish benign and malignant cells, the photographs would have been published within the lead article of the prestigious medical journal of the author's choice. And any second-year medical student knows this. On this evidence alone... at least for now, I will draw the obvious conclusion. To the team's credit, they engage in no dark talk of conspiracies to suppress a breakthrough. But the truth is that the screens that actually work (i.e., that work in more than one person's lab) are quickly taken by big-money corporations and used to earn huge profits. It is inconceivable that no biotechnology corporation has tried to reproduce the work on \"malignin\". And no major lab has told an audience of fellow-scientists that \"malignin\" even exists. Real science is the serious business of trying to make sense of the world, constantly testing and taking elaborate precautions against self-deception. No one can say with real confidence exactly what's going on here. I believe in the sincerity and good intentions of the persons offering the test, and those promoting it. For now, I must simply caution physicians and patients alike against basing clinical decisions on the \"anti-malignin antibody serum test.\" The principal website promoting anti-malignin antibody is: amascancertest.com Follow Up I have now (July 27, 1999) obtained and reviewed the other major publications on \"malignin\". I found the following to be the most revealing. J Med. 13:49, 1982. The team presents data on staining of cells from patients known to have cancer, and those known not to have cancer. What's astounding is that the team did not focus on whether the actual cells they were staining were cancerous, but only whether the patients had cancer. On the evidence, the team took any cells that were handy. There were 22 specimens, evidently all liquid (effusions, brushings, or aspirations), since duplicates were sent to pathologists for papanicolaou examination. The authors report \"Standard Papanicolaou stain examinations performed blind on duplicates of these specimens by other pathologists were correct in 17/22 specimens (77%).\" It is commonplace for a person with cancer to produce specimens that do not contain cancer cells, and visual examination by a pathologist remains the gold standard for diagnosis. If I understand English, this means that the group is reporting that its antibody stains cells from cancer patients even if there are no cancer cells in the specimen. This is weird, since the team also claims that only cancer cells express malignin. The photos that accompany the article are also curious. The pattern of staining on the supposed squamous lung cancer cells looks coarse and very irregular. (I can't tell that this isn't just nonspecific dye binding to a bit of lung debris.) The \"lymphocytic leukemia cell from blood\" (somebody did a papanicolaou stain on blood?) looks like a normal lymphocyte though I can't exclude a very low-grade leukemia. The \"ovarian carcinoma cells at surgery\" appear not to be stained at all, and the \"anaplastic astrocytoma at surgery\" photo is probably not really stained either, since there is no nuclear-cytoplasmic differentiation. The remaining photo isn't even from one of the 22 patients, but from a cell culture of a squamous cancer from a group in Florida, which I found despite the article's reference to the mainstream journal Cancer Research being incorrect. Something is not right here. Neurochem Res 4:465, 1979. The team described two more proteins, which they named \"recognins\". Nobody else has ever reported that either of these even exists. Cancer Det Prev 6: 317, 1983. An author in Germany reviewed tumor markers in the CNS, mentioning astrocytin and malignin and the team's claims. He adds that \"These findings remain to be confirmed by others\" \u2014 as true today as it was 16 years ago. Int J Biol Mark 12:141, 1997. The Italian NCI team reviews the original team's work uncritically. There is no \"Materials and Methods\" section, and no new data. In other words, even these people do not have an independent assay for \"malignin\", and has not even described the substance independently. My local biochemist reviewed the articles and pointed out: The team writes about supposed phylogenetic relationships without even reporting a sequence; The team writes about carbohydrates components of the molecules they have supposedly discovered, without ever describing what the carbohydrates are; The team gives molecular weight by chromatography rather than by ultracentrifugation, which was the norm even 20 years ago.

NCAHF thinks that a strong relationship may exist between misbeliefs about sugar and a proneness to quackery. DALE ALEXANDER DIES Dale Alexander, the self-styled nutritionist who advocated taking cod liver oil and orange juice for arthritis has died at age 70. A promoter of dubious nutrition for four decades, Alexander was author of five books titled Arthritis and Common Sense, Good Health and Common Sense, The Common Cold and Common Sense, Healthy Hair and Common Sense, and Dry Skin and Common Sense. Alexander was one of 11 California gubernatorial candidates in 1966. (Los Angeles Times, 6/17/90). CHIROPRACTIC NECK MANIPULATION RESULTS IN QUADRIPLEGIA A Bakersfield woman became paralyzed from the neck down following chiropractic manipulation for neck pain. Tamara Joerns, 27, mother of three, is described as a former cheer leader, homecoming princess and track athlete. She now spends her time in bed unable to speak or control her routine bodily functions. Mrs. Joerns went to the chiropractor on the advice of her mother who now cares for Joerns' two sons. The family has filed a $5 million lawsuit against Leonard S. Ross, DC. [The Bakersfield Californian, 9/2/90]. Comment: NCAHF is told that this is not the first case of paralysis attributed to Ross, and that he carries only minimal malpractice insurance. We are also informed that there have been at least five other cases of paralysis in the Bakersfield area attributed to chiropractic manipulation. NCAHF warned that paralysis was one of the hazards of rotary neck manipulation in its position paper on chiropractic, however, we accepted organized chiropractic's contention that such events are extremely rare. We may have been misled. We have been told that defense attorneys often are successful in preventing media coverage of these tragedies. We are investigating the risk of paralysis related to manipulation further. Any aid readers can provide will be appreciated. APPEALS COURT REVERSES JUDGE, RAW MILK DAIRY HELD LIABLE IN DEATH In 1987 a Pomona (Calif) Superior Court jury awarded $40,000 to the family of Paul Telford, finding that his death was the result of an infection caused by drinking Alta Dena Dairy Certified Raw Milk. However, Judge Theodore Piatt overturned the jury's verdict citing \"insufficient evidence\" and granted the dairy a new trial. On June 13, the California Court of Appeals overturned Piatt's ruling and reinstated the verdict against Alta Dena Dairy. (Alta Dena Dairy no longer sells raw milk; the product involved in Telford's death is now sold as \"Stueve's Natural.\") Comment: In fact, Judge Piatt was very obstructive and would not permit evidence that linked the dairy's herd directly to the infection in Telford's body (see NCAHF Newsletter, July-August, 1987).

Price: $14.00 (312 pp.) OREGON DELICENSES NATUROPATHS WITH FAKED CREDENTIALS - The Oregon Office of Educational Policy and Planning is in the process of validating academic degrees claimed by a number of health care practitioners licensed in that state. Findings thus far have uncovered the following misrepresentations: - Joseph A. Blandino, Jacksonville, OR, misrepresented possession of:(1) an AA degree and submitted a counterfeit diploma copy; (2) a Doctor of Medicine degree; and, (3) a Doctor of Naturopathy degree and submitted a counterfeit diploma copy. - Jeffrey W. Greene, Glendale, CA, misrepresented possession of a Doctor of Naturopathy degree and submitted a counterfeit diploma copy. - Kenneth R. Franklin, Downey, CA, misrepresented possession of a Doctor of Naturopathy degree and submitted a counterfeit diploma copy. - Kurt W. Donsbach, San Ysidro, CA, misrepresented possession of a Doctor of Naturopathy degree and submitted a counterfeit diploma copy. - Melvin C. Maas, Los Angeles, CA, misrepresented a Doctor of Naturopathy degree and submitted a counterfeit diploma copy. The Oregon agency details the specific techniques used to counterfeit diplomas from the Hollywood College. They say: \"In addition to listing the graduation date as the \"17st day of June,\" the diploma copy contains several very obvious internal inconsistencies in spacing, line and calligraphy. It is not copied from an integral diploma. Instead it is, with a different name of recipient, a copy identical to one that has been determined by the Arizona Department of Public Safety to be a photocopy manipulation...\" (The case of Jess Franklin Lee, No. 87001-A, June 24, 1988). Comment: The Oregon action was prompted by reform efforts within the naturopathic community to purge itself of practitioners with fraudulent diplomas. In our view, this represents a small, but significant, step in the right direction of a very long journey. DOCTORS' LICENSES SUSPENDED OVER CHELATION THERAPY Two New Jersey physicians, Linda Choi and Priyakant Doshi, partners in the Medical Nutrition Center, have had their medical licenses suspended for one year (sentence stayed and probation imposed) for improper medical practices. Both must cease and desist from treating vascular diseases with EDTA chelation therapy, diagnosing and treating \"Candida Albicans Overgrowth Syndrome\" (an unrecognized condition), utilizing hair analysis in the clinical evaluation of patients (except for lead poisoning), and stop permitting unlicensed assistants to administer intravenous solutions. (Consent orders filed 6/5/90, New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners.) Comment: The doctors were prosecuted in this case despite the fact that the indictment noted that the FDA has granted an Investigation New Drug (IND) permit for a clinical trial of EDTA chelation therapy for heart disease. Noting that the granting of an IND only permits a clinical trial, it does not prove the value of a therapy. Interestingly, the FDA recently dropped EDTA chelation therapy from its list of Top Ten Health Frauds (FDA Consumer, October, 1989) because of the IND issuance. It seems as if the agency is confused about the meaning of an IND, or health fraud, or both. FITNESS VIDEOS CRITIQUE Janis Johnson provides an excellent critique of popular fitness videos in the health and fitness magazine Vibrant Life (July-August, 1988). Included are guidelines on how to pick a home exercise video. Routines should be well-rounded, approved by a person's physician, capable of being individualized, accompanied by useful advice, easy to follow and enjoyable, led by a qualified instructor, gradual and progressive, and available for previewing. LATINO HEALTH FRAUD CONFERENCE On September 13-14, the Dept. of Health & Human Services, U.S. Public Health Service and FDA, sponsored a Western Regional Health Fraud Conference for the Latino Community in Los Angeles. An excellent slate of speakers addressed the problem of health fraud, misinformation and quackery within the Latino community. Many myths rampant in the dominant \"Anglo\" culture were also addressed. The interface of folk medicine and quackery is more apparent within the Latino community, but more similarities than differences exist. NCAHF participants were William Jarvis, on folk remedies & health fraud; James Lowell on Mexican border clinics; Grace Monaco on unproven cancer remedies; and, Robin Nishiwaki on combating health fraud within the community. \"TRADITIONAL MEDICINE\" A common abuse by health writers is referring to scientific health care as \"traditional medicine\" Webster's defines tradition as: \"the handing down of information, beliefs and customs by word of mouth or by example from one generation to another without written instruction.\" The term is correctly applicable to folk healers, not to modern medicine. Modern medicine is iconoclastic which is anti-tradition. Iconoclasts tear down tradition. \"The influence of modern science\" is cited as an example of iconoclasm by Webster's 3rd New International Dictionary. Regular medicine is often referred to as \"traditional medicine\" implying that it is staid and closedminded. In fact, it is traditional medical systems such as ancient Chinese, Indian (Ayurvedic), astrology, and the like that cling doggedly to fanciful pre-scientific notions about energy meridians, pulse diagnoses, heavenly influences on behavior, etcetera, which are thousands of years old. Closedmindedness seems to be a virtue in these systems. CONSUMER ATTITUDES TOWARD ORGANIC FOODS \"Organic foods: consumer attitudes and use\" (Food Technology, 43:(11): 60-66, 1989) reports on a survey taken in September-October, 1987 (before the alar hysteria) on California consumers' attitudes toward organic foods (OF's). 57% considered OF's better, 35% the same, 7% worse than conventional foods. 30% said that they planned to buy OF's within the next month, 28% did not; 53% had bought OF's in the past and 23% had not. People who did not buy cited availability, high price and the fact the product was no better than conventionally grown foods as reasons. The most frequently purchased type of OF's in order were fruits, vegetables, chicken, eggs, beef and pork. Food safety was the main concern of the respondents in this survey with 80.2% marking it \"very important.\" Price was of least importance with 49.5% marking it \"very important.\" Residues and additives were of greatest concern. Comment. It is important to note that this survey focused upon food safety. We sense that there may be a shift away from food safety to concerns about the environmental impact of modern agriculture given the current political climate. CHIROPRACTIC CARE FOUND BETTER FOR LOW BACK PAIN A British study of 741 randomly assigned patients aged 18-65 that compared chiropractic treatment with hospital outpatient care (utilizing more conservative physiotherapeutic techniques) in the treatment of low back pain without nerve root involvement found that although there was no difference in outcomes in patients with no history of back pain, those with such a history who were treated by chiropractors (DCs) fared significantly better at 6, 12 and 24 month follow-ups. Outcome was evaluated by a questionnaire (Oswestry score: a self-assessment of pain intensity, including pain while lifting and sitting) [Brit Med J, 300:1431-7, 1990]. Chiropractic propagandists are overstating the findings of this study. Its design places great limitations on its generalizability. This was a pragmatic study meaning that the types of therapies applied in the 11 (of each) participating hospital and chiropractic clinics was not controlled. A pragmatic study does not compare one therapy (99% of the DC-treated subjects were manipulated compared to only 12% of hospital-treated) with another but compares treatment sites that consumers might select. This limits the value of the data. In fact, it is the type of design NCAHF President William Jarvis has long advocated as a starting point in testing the efficacy of chiropractic. Second, the researchers excluded patients with contraindications (eg, nerve root involvement, weakened bones, structural abnormalities) to avoid harm. If DCs do not screen for these contraindications the pragmatic patient population of DCs would differ from this study. Third, chiropractic care was limited to a maximum of 10 treatments. This is less than DCs are apt to do when on their own. Fourth, the chiropractic care in this study extended over a significantly longer time period (up to 30 weeks compared to a maximum of 12 weeks at hospitals) and involved 44% more sessions. Fifth, Chiropractic care was more expensive ($280 vs $190). This may have been compensated for by less work absenteeism following care. Sixth, we have been unable to obtain information on the reliability and validity of the Oswestry test. We would have preferred a performance test rather than a questionnaire as a method of observation. Lastly, researchers know that treatment groups may vary significantly even when random assignment is employed, especially when numbers are below 1600 (hence, the importance of replication of research findings by others). This reviewer finds it curious that major differences in patient performance was still apparent two years later. This suggests that a real difference may have existed in the two groups despite randomization. Given the natural history of low back pain, there is little, if any, reason to expect that treatment intervention would have such long term effects. Curiously, NCAHF has received several letters from DCs saying \"I told you so!\" Apparently, they have not read the NCAHF Position Paper on Chiropractic in which we state: \"There is substantial evidence that manipulative therapy has value in treating back pain.\" Although we state that there is no evidence of long term benefits which is now questionable. We also state that: \"Chiropractors probably are more skilled in the art of manipulation than other practitioners...(and)..usually the most accessible...\" The fact is that NCAHF has always been supportive of chiropractic care for functional back pain. It's too bad that it took MDs to design a study that DCs should have conducted themselves. We wonder if this study will affect chiropractic services. Will DCs: - screen patients more carefully for contraindications to manipulation? - inform patients with no history of back pain that chiropractic care may not be any more effective than other methods? - limit the number of treatments they render? NCAHF remains dedicated to helping responsible DCs bring their manual treatment skills into the main stream of health care. Note: The NCAHF Position Paper on Chiropractic has been described as \"a milestone contribution to the knowledge and understanding of those concerned about societal and community health care issues as they relate to chiropractic. This document ...provides an updated review and objective analysis of manipulative therapy ...\" [White and Punjabi. Clinical Biomechanics of the Spine, 2nd Edition. Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1990, p.434]. ROBERT RODALE KILLED Robert Rodale, 60, owner of Prevention magazine and other publications was killed in a auto accident in Moscow, September 20th. Although NCAHF has long regarded Rodale's publications as unreliable sources of health information, there have been marked improvements under his leadership in recent years. We saw Mr. Rodale as a key player in producing popular publications that would reach the public with sound health information. We extend condolences to the Rodale Press family and hope that they will continue the reforms Robert Rodale evidently supported. DONSBACH BEHIND NEW HEALTH PLAN Wellness Lifestyle Health Plan, a new HMO-type program, is being promoted in Arizona as an alternative to regular medical insurance. Organizers say they will offer the services of herbalists, chiropractors, midwives and acupuncturists. Hal Card and chiropractor Kurt Donsbach are behind the scheme. Card is the former Operations Manager of the National Health Federation. He is billed as Chairman of the All American Consumer Cooperative Association. The plan is described in Donsbach's Wellness Lifestyle Magazine (1/90, p.53-4). KENTUCKY HOLISTIC PHYSICIAN DISCIPLINED The Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure disciplined Walter W. Stoll, MD, for prescribing amphetamines for himself and another patient in Oregon whom he hadn't examined in 15 years. Stoll, 53, was placed on probation for 5 years and had his license to prescribe controlled substances suspended. He will also be required to submit to random urine testing for drug abuse and see a psychiatrist. It is reported that nearly 50 sign-waving Stoll supporters demonstrated outside the Board's Louisville offices. The demonstration was organized by Nancy Erwin, a housewife who is president of the National Health Federation's Kentucky chapter. (The Courier Journal, 8/17/90). ANTHROPOLOGISTS CHALLENGED TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE To understand quackery one must begin with a study of humankind's earliest notions about the nature of disease and healing. These are inseparable from fundamental beliefs about the nature of reality itself-including the physical world, humanness (life & death), and natural forces. How these have been perceived in the past by the common folk constitutes the history of folk medicine while the history of ideas traces the views of thought leaders (i.e., philosophers). The history of ideas includes the history of medicine and the development of science, including the development of medical research methodology. Academic specialization divides these up into fields of study in ways that are not always helpful. Anthropology is the academic discipline most concerned with folk medicine and culture. Although anthropologist produce high quality papers in their own fields, they often show a lack of understanding of experimental science in general and medicine in particular. Anthropologists often use their discipline as a platform from which to attack science and modern medicine which they erroneous dub \"Western\" as if physical laws and the causal agents of disease operated differently in the \"East.\" This attitude fosters cultural conflict that can seriously impact upon public health policies. An exceptional monograph [Glaser. \"Accountability of anthropologists, indigenous healers and their governments: a plea for reasonable medicine,\" Soc Sci Med, 27:(12):1461-1464, 1988] challenges anthropologists to be more responsible in their portrayal of modern medicine and folk healers. Anthropologists are fond of decrying the dehumanizing aspects of modern medicine and paying great tribute to the use of magic and ritual in primitive therapeutics. Shamans and witch doctors are often heralded as being superior healers because of their attention to dispelling hexes and other culturally defined evils. Although there seems to be little dispute over the idea that an effective way to get rid of an imaginary hex is through a ritual, anthropologists may exaggerate the effectiveness and the \"bedside manner\" of traditional healers [see side box] (ie, barefoot doctors, herbalists, bone doctors, shamans). Glaser questions the notion that traditional healers are actually effective health care providers in the same sense as are modern doctors who practice on the basis of science. He challenges anthropologists to be scientific in their analysis of the value of traditional healing. Reference is made to the dearth of outcome studies of native medicine. The few that have been done do not show good results. A study of spiritualist healers found a cure rate of less than a 50% which was less than spontaneous healing should have done. The lack of scientific acumen by the anthropologist was revealed when she gave credit to the healer for the cures that did occur despite the absence of a control group. The article also helps explode the myth fostered by anthropologists that native healers are more generous with their time than modern doctors. A study of curanderos found that treatments often involved only 1-2 minutes of conversation. One writer is cited who \"admits that it is easy to be intimidated into advocating for traditional indigenous healing practices.\" The World Health Organization is accused of \"pandering to nationalistic pride\" by not dealing objectively with the real effectiveness of native medicine. It is noted that wealthy people in third world countries patronize modern scientific doctors and the poor use folk healers. Poor people are entitled to quality medicine as well. Giving credence to the value of folk medicine without evidence they are effective is irresponsible. The monograph is worth reading because it has implications for those who must evaluate and regulate traditional folk medicine practices in primitive settings, as well as those who must deal with folk medicine which has been converted to quackery in modern settings. 1990 NATIONAL HEALTH FRAUD CONFERENCE: BRIEF REPORT The National Health Fraud Conference (NHFC) was a splendid event that brought together quackbusters, quacks, quackophiliacs (ie, lovers of quackery) and others. The conference began with a Sunday evening show by magician Bob Steiner of how persuasive deception can be with alleged ESP feats and a demonstration of psychic surgery. Monday and Tuesday plenary sessions covered: the history of quackery and consumer protection (William Jarvis); current experiences with health fraud (Victor Herbert); the Postal Inspector's efforts against mail-order health fraud (Ass't Chief Inspector, Kenneth Hearst); current FTC initiatives against health fraud (Assoc. Director for Advertising Practices, Lee Peeler); AIDS quackery, fraud and misinformation (Jarvis, Wallace Sampson and John Renner); what needs to be done to combat quackery (Stephen Barrett); what the FDA is doing to combat health fraud (Ass't to the Assoc. FDA Commissioner William Schwemmer); and, what the HHS Inspector General is doing about health fraud (Inspector, Linda Lloyd). Workshops were held on: investigative techniques; child advocacy; techniques used in billing insurance companies; the role of state Attorneys General; chiropractic nonsense; analyzing false claims; chronic fatigue real & unreal; dental health fraud; legal aspects of health fraud; and, how New Age health fraud is marketed to the church. As with past health fraud conferences, dissenters were present to demonstrate. This time it was ACT UP, the radical gay-activist group that effectively shut down the FDA offices in Rockville and booed HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan to inaudibility earlier this year. As is their right, ACT UP members picketed in front of the hotel. Signs they carried badly misrepresented the purposes of the conference, revealing deception by organized quackery. Consistent with their history, ACT UP members exceeded their rights by engaging in civil disobedience by blocking the hotel entrance by mass lay-downs-including the cutting open of a feather pillow-in the hotel doorway. Unlike Federal agencies, the NHFC is private and does not have to put up with these disruptive tactics. The KC police were quick to arrest and remove violators. At least 17 arrests were made. Attempted disruption of a meeting was limited to Dr. Victor Herbert's presentation. Herbert proved to be up to the challenge and continued to present a lucid exposition of organized quackery while funny-looking people exploded into the room or popped up from within the audience doing irrational acts (for instance, two would rise, one shouting the ACT UP message while a partner made the message inaudible by simultaneously blowing a police-type whistle; it never seemed to occur to them that they were defeating their own attempts to voice their views). As sad and unfortunate as it was to see desperate, alienated patients so badly deceived by quackery, Herbert's mastery of the situation was a rare performance none will forget. It was like watching an orchestra conductor lead the 1812 Overture with cymbals, cannon-booms and all. Herbert deftly pointed out that the spectacle was consistent with the title of his presentation: \"Current experiences with the world of fraud!\" ACT UP's agenda generally emphasizes the slowness of the FDA to approve experimental remedies and a lack of commitment to finding an AIDS cure. We are told that some within ACT UP are convinced that AIDS is germ warfare initiated by the CIA against gay people and that no cure will be forthcoming until the gay community is decimated. At Kansas City, ACT UP added the shouting of the familiar \"freedom of choice\" slogans of organized quackery. Unlike the quacks, however, ACT UP called for informed choice which placed them squarely in harmony with NCAHF and the NHFC. ACT UP representatives were invited to appear on the platform and discuss minimum standards of consumer protection for AIDS patients, but refused to enter into a dialogue. It was abundantly clear that ACT UP's only purpose was to disrupt the conference. There is good reason to believe that most of the funding to fly 35 ACT UP members to Kansas City came from key figures within organized quackery. It was quite apparent from the propaganda handed-out at the meeting that ACT UP had been the victim of deception by organized quackery. ACT UP published false messages such as \"corporate interests\" are \"behind NCAHF,\" and that the purpose of the conference was to label all alternative treatments \"quackery\" with \"special focus on AIDS.\" The reality is that NCAHF has no corporate backing and is the only consumer organization founded entirely upon the precepts of consumer protection law. NCAHF is on the side of patients and has a number of AIDS sufferers who appreciate its antiquackery efforts among its membership. Further, AIDS quackery was not the focus of the NHFC until ACT UP's public actions made it so. Sadly, the ACT UP leaders' ears seemed closed to reason, but a few members appeared to grasp the concept. The episode was illustrative of a quotation cited by William Jarvis in his opening address on historical perspective of the problem of quackery: \"the victim of quackery is like a man with a poor glass eye, everyone can see through it but him.\" On Tuesday, the NCAHF AIDS Quackery Task Force issued a comprehensive press release containing shocking revelations on abuses of AIDS patients. Copies are available from the NCAHF Resource Center.

McCutcheon reviewed books, articles and scientific reports on the topic. Aroma therapy involves putting a few drops of some kind of fragrant plant oil in one's bath water, sniffing it from an inhaler, or massaging it into the skin. Claims such as putting fragrant oil into a warm bath will help insomnia, or rubbing oils on the genitals promotes sexual stimulation clearly confuses the action of the oils with the effects of a warm bath per se, or the effect of genital massaging. Aroma therapy theory eulogizes smell as \"the most direct route to the brain,\" and therefore, superior as a route of administration. McCutcheon notes that although smell may be nifty, it does not have any special advantages over other sensory pathways. Aroma therapists push the idea that natural oils are better than synthetic ones without any scientific justification. The idea that aroma therapy oils can help memory is also challenged if the smell wasn't part of the original experience being recalled. She also reveals that aroma therapy advocates are making an unwarranted pretense of science in their writings. McCutcheon provides the best critique of aroma therapy that we have seen. HEALTH FOOD INDUSTRY: LITTLE TO DO WITH EITHER HEALTH OR FOOD Newsweek (\"Herbal warning,\" May 6, 1996) exposes the modern health food movement for what it has become-the shopping place for the \"natural drug culture.\" There are many herbs that can stimulate or depress the central nervous system, or distort sensory perception. In the past such were called \"street drugs.\" Newsweek caught on when products such as Herbal Ecstasy, Cloud 9 and Ultimate Xphoria began to be promoted for energy highs, \"inner visions,\" \"sexual sensations,\" and \"cosmic consciousness.\" Health enthusiasts have long judged pills and potions by how they make them \"feel.\" The belief that vitamins provide more \"pep and energy\" is one of the most prevalent misconceptions held by supplement users. Vitamin advertisers often exploit this myth. Selling \"high energy\" took on new dimensions when the health food industry increased its marketing of herbal remedies. Ephedrine, caffeine, ginseng, and other herbal uppers have become the stars of the new medicine show. Other herbs with powerful physiologic effects are laxatives, diuretics, and emetics. Herbal promotions have regressed to the prescientific perception that did not differentiate foods from drugs. The ancients believed that anything they ate contained a vitalistic (ie, life-sustaining) element, and that some substances were magical in that they could liberate their \"souls\" from their bodies for a time. These were the mood-modifying and hallucinogenic drugs found in herbs (opium, marijuana, peyote, etc). Many of these were the main ingredients in the \"patent medicines\" that thrived before consumer protection laws were passed-dubbed \"the golden age of quackery.\" Thanks to Senator Hatch's 1994 Dietary Supplements Health & Education Act, the marketplace now resembles those outlaw years. The major difference between now and then is that the Harrison Narcotics Act restricts use of opiates and a few other abuse drugs. [If Milton Friedman and Thomas Szasz had their way, abuse drugs would be legalized (On Liberty and Drugs Drug Policy Foundation, 1992). Friedman also wrote Free to Choose (Avon, 1979) advocating eliminating the FDA. ] The report includes information on several deaths associated with the use of herbal products. It was interesting to read the letters to the editor (5/27/96) that followed the original story. Herbal devotees tried to justify health food abuses by pointing to the misuse of approved medications. It seems to be lost on them that the difference is that standard medicines have information on proper use, contraindications, overdosage, and so forth. Herbal remedy labels rarely provide consumers with the information they need for proper use, and are often unwilling to even fulfill a duty to warn of possible adverse effects. The attorney for the family of a San Jose woman who died after using pennyroyal stated that the family had entered into a confidential settlement with the manufacturer and distributors, but had been unable to compel them to place a warning on pennyroyal bottles. CALIFORNIANS FAVOR FLUORIDATION NEARLY 5-1 A 4,000-respondent telephone survey by the California Dept of Health Services of the willingness to vote for fluoridation has been conducted annually since 1984. Based upon pooled responses 1991-94, 71% of California adults would vote for fluoridation. About 15% would not, and the remainder are undecided. Althoug h variations were small, demographically, college graduates, older adults, and black people were most favorable. [California Morbidity 9/95] WEIGHT-LOSS QUACKERY Frances Berg, editor of the Healthy Weight Journal, and Coordinator of the NCAHF Task Force on Unsound Weight Loss Practices, has put together an exceptional 32-page manual entitled Weight Loss Quackery and Fads. The manual provides guidelines for spotting weight loss fraud and quackery, describes the modus operandi of the weight loss quacks, and provides insight on different categories of products: creams, patches and aids; gadgets; and diet pills. The section \"Themes, schemes & combos\" discusses persistent myths promulgated by weight loss quackery: \"all natural\" means safe, \"cellulite\" exists in the body, \"spot reduction\" can be achieved, and the notion of \"detoxifying\" the body. Schemes to sell weight loss products include illegal sales pyramids, hit and run scams, infomercials, and hypnosis seminars. The last section lists specific products that have been given \"Slim Chance Awards\" as the worst weight loss products of the year from 1990 through 1995, and a list of 111 ingredients listed by the FDA as not generally recognized as safe and effective for weight control. The manual also tells consumers how to report fraud, and lists five different types of harm caused by weight loss fraud. Weight Loss Quackery and Fads can be purchased for $11.95 plus $3 P&H. Order from Healthy Weight Journal St., Hettinger, ND 58639; tele: 1996 SLIM CHANCE AWARDS Worst Product: Ephedrine-laced diet pills. Named are Formula One and Herbalife's Thermojetics, but there are many more. Side effects of these products include heart damage, stroke, increased blood pressure and seizures. The FDA reports some 330 adverse reactions and about a dozen deaths. Most Outrageous: Kombucha mushroom tea (aka, Fungus, Kargasok, Manchurian, or Kvass tea) because of the plethora of outlandish claims that have been made for it. Burning body fat and weight loss are only two of more than 50 claims that include curing AIDS and cancer. Worst Claim: By attending a single 2-hour Gorayab hypnosis seminar, \"You can expect results ranging from 30-60 lbs in 3 months to 120 lbs in one year\"; \"No willpower, no hunger, no dieting, just success. Using the power of hypnosis.\" Worst Gadget: Ninzu ear clips, a device that fits on the ear, claims to suppress appetite through acupressure. [Healthy Weight Loss Journal, Jan-Feb, 1996] FIGHT TO SAVE EPHEDRA WEIGHT-LOSS PRODUCTS TAKING SHAPE Larry Hobbs, author of The New Diet Pills, claims that ephedrine plus caffeine is \"the ideal diet pill.\" His arguments are elaborated in the June, 1996 Townsend Letter, a publication that provides a forum for the proponents of controversial health methods and a token number of critics. Hobbs details the effects of ephedrine, caffeine, theophylline, aspirin, and L-tyrosine in various combinations and strengths. He does not deny the potential adverse effects of these substances, and discusses contraindications and possible drug interactions. Nevertheless, Hobbs is highly favorable to ephedra+caffeine products and we believe that his information will be used to campaign for their continued availability on a nonprescription basis. The \"feel-good\" effects of ephedra products are too much a part of the OTC herbal market for it to give up the privilege of selling these without a fight*. Although this is an advocacy article, it is well-referenced. Since diet pills also have potential for harm, weight loss professionals should read this article for perspective. *Frances Berg says that Herbalife's Thermojetics alone was worth $70 million in 1995 U.S. sales. MEDICAL LICENSING BOARDS' MEETING SHAKES QUACKDOM The 84th Annual meeting of the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) held in Chicago on April 12 has Arlene Brecher, a publicist for the Townsend Letter, in a tizzy. Brecher attended a session entitled \"Fraudulent Medical Practice-Watch and Be Wary\" that focused on increased attacks around the country on medical practice acts by the proponents and practitioners of alternative medicine-so-called \"medical freedom\" laws. Brecher declares that the medical boards' concerns about the erosion of these consumer protection laws is, in fact, a manifestation of the grand medical conspiracy against alternative and complementary medicine. The focus at the meeting was upon chelation therapy for vascular disorders (Townsend Letter publisher and editor, Jonathan Collin, MD is a chelationist). Chelation therapy for vascular disorders is a big ticket item for maverick medical doctors and osteopaths. The fact that the medical procedure is approved for heavy metal detoxification, means that any doctor who wants to engage in the off-label use of EDTA infusion can do so. Most do not because the scientific evidence for efficacy for vascular problems is not there. Off-label use per se is not illegal, and can be a route to finding new uses of medications approved for other purposes. Responsible doctors gather clinical data to determine if sufficient reason exists to conduct controlled trials. Irresponsible doctors are content with meeting the demand for services resulting from positive promotions. Once the FDA approves a medication for any reason, there is nothing but personal integrity or medical discipline to prevent physicians from using the medication for unapproved purposes. When facing medical discipline, chelationists often rally their patients to political action. This is not difficult to do with patients who have been persuaded by the doctor that chelation therapy has saved them from both surgery and heart disease. Grateful patients willingly carry placards declaring their beliefs, and testify against the regulators who are characterized as bureaucratic dupes who do the bidding of the \"medical establishment.\" In addition to Brecher's article, Collin declared in his June editorial, \"We're quacks now, by gum, we're quacks.\" He says that because chelationists practice a form of medicine based upon \"junk\" science they have been labeled \"quacks\" by the FSMB. His reference is to the publications of chelationist groups that carry articles extolling chelation therapy that could not pass muster in the scientific arena. NCAHF labels such organizations \"mutual admiration societies\" because despite having names that sound scientific, they avoid the skepticism and critical analytical debate that characterize scientific groups. The American Heritage Dictionary defines conspiracy as: \"Law: An agreement between to or more persons to commit a crime or to accomplish a legal purpose through illegal action.\" There is a conspiracy involved here, but Brecher has it backwards. The conspiracy is being perpetrated by chelationists who are out to defraud consumers, insurance companies, and Medicare by selling a procedure that not only has insufficient evidence of value, but has been repeatedly shown to be worthless. NCAHF believes that Collin has it right: those who substitute junk science for real science in order to create the illusion in the health care marketplace that their methods have value are quacks. HEALTH FOODS INDUSTRY GROUP GETS NATUROPATHIC PRACTICE ACT IN UTAH The sweetheart relationship between naturopaths and the healt h food industry became more transparent with the passage of a naturopathic licensure act in Utah. Health Forum, the lobbying organization that pulled off the action, was led by Rae Howard, President of the National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA), and President of Good Earth Natural Foods at Orem, Utah. In NNFA Today (5/96, p.9) Howard boasts that: \"every state legislator received a visit by representatives from Health Forum and other constituents. Grassroots meetings and training sessions were held throughout the state beginning last September, to explain the bill to consumers, train them in the political process and organize support.\" It is said that this is the first time such a licensure bill was prepared and passed into law \"through the efforts of health care consumers...and not from within the profession itself.\" In the July-August, 1995 NCAHF Newsletter we reported on some of the health food industry leaders who sit on the board of Bastyr University, naturopathy's number one training school. Support for naturopathy by the health food industry is entirely self-serving. Naturopaths prescribe the dietary supplements (eg, herbal remedies, homeopathic products, amino acids, \"glandulars,\" \"enzymes,\" etc) in the same way physicians prescribe approved medications. Naturopathy generally hold the same pseudoscientific views on health and nutrition as the health food industry. Thus, the industry is creating its own brand of \"doctor\" who will reinforce the delusions that sustain the health food movement. As the influence of naturopathy on the population increases, one can expect that fewer children will be immunized, or enjoy the benefits of other public healt h advances. The negative effects of this symbiotic relationship is likely to be hard to detect because it represents a closed system with few opportunities to be observed by outside experts. Once a patient accepts the ND as a legitimate doctor, his/her fate is sealed. The ND is now in a position to define the patient's health or illness, and to interpret clinical outcomes as he/she will. Most dangerous is the fallacious \"healing crisis\" theory which celebrates the adverse reactions users experience as \"the poisons coming out of the body.\" Thus, if a person feels good it is proof that the remedy is working; or, if the person feels badly it is interpreted as the \"poisons coming out.\" Therefore, good is good, and bad is also good. The fact that a patient freely chooses a practitioner goes far in legally absolving NDs from accountability because they are judged by naturopathic, not by medical, standards of practice. HUGGINS VOWS TO FIGHT ON AFTER LICENSE REVOCATION On May 1, the Colorado State Board of Dental Examiners followed the recommendations of State Administrative Law Judge Nancy Connick and revoked the license of Colorado Springs dentist Hal Huggins. Huggins vows to continue his campaign against the use of dental fillings that contain mercury. He claims to be getting 5,000 telephone calls a month from people all over the world. Huggins says he will continue to consult with physicians and dentists. However, the dental licensing board says that it is against state law for a dentist whose license has been revoked to own a dental practice or to do consultation work with other dentists. Huggins complains that this violates his First Amendment rights of free speech. We may not have heard the last from Huggins versus the law. [Gazette-Telegraph (Colo Sprgs) 5/3/96] GINSENG SAID TO HELP DIABETIC PATIENTS Ginseng continues to be an enigma. Just when one thinks that he has found something that ginseng really does, something happens to spoil the joy. Recently we reported on the lack of proof for its value in physical performance. Now we see a report on a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that found ginseng elevated mood, improved psychophysical performance, and reduced fasting blood glucose and body weight in 36 non-insulin dependent diabetics. It is clear that ginseng exerts a pharmacological effect in these patients. [Diabetes Care 1995;18:1373-5] Comment: Ginseng is worth watching because it can be expected to come into wider use as plantations now maturing in Canada and the USA come of age for harvesting. Do not be surprised to see ginseng join coffee and tea as popular herbal drinks for mood elevation. HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy involves treatment in which a patient breathes 100% pure oxygen intermittently while the pressure of the treatment chamber is increased to a point higher than sea level pressure (1 atmosphere absolute [ATA]). Treatment can be done in either a single patient monoplace, or several patient multiplace, chamber. Currently, it is held that pressurization should be 1.4 ATA or higher. HBO research began during the 1930s as navies and universities around the world began to study ways to safely decompress deep-sea divers. In 1976, recognizing the need for meticulous scrutiny of emerging clinical applications of HBO therapy, the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS) established the Hyperbaric Oxygen Committee and charged it with the responsibility of continuously reviewing research and clinical data, and rendering recommendations on the clinical efficacy and safety of HBO therapy for various conditions. The Committee has met annually since then. In 1976 and 1979, 28 indications were listed as approved for third party reimbursement. In the 1992 report, the number had been pared to 12. For approval, the Committee requires sound physiologic rationale, in vivo or in vitro studies that demonstrate effectiveness, controlled animal studies, prospective controlled clinical studies, and extensive clinical experience from multiple recognized hyperbaric medicine centers. The Committee requires that experimental and clinical evidence be at least as convincing as that for any other currently accepted treatment modality for the disorder involved. The Committee also reviews cost-effectiveness and has established guidelines for each entity. Disorders Approved For Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy: - Clostridial myonecrosis - traumatic ischemias (eg, crush injury) - Skin grafts and flaps (compromised) - Selected problem wounds - Radiation tissue damage - CO poisoning & smoke inhalation - Air or gas embolism - Thermal burns - Decompression sickness - Anemia due to excessive blood loss Abuse of HBO Therapy The most common abuses of HBO therapy that NCAHF hears about are in the treatment of patients who have suffered strokes, multiple sclerosis, and as in combination wit h chelation therapy for cardiovascular disease. In 1995, it was reported that former President Ronald Reagan had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. It was later reported that he was undergoing HBO therapy for this problem. Although there is no scientific justification for treating Alzheimer's disease by HBO therapy, the publicity given to well-known personalities is likely to spawn some abuses. The manufacturers of hyperbaric chambers cannot refuse to sell the devices to people authorized by law to use them. Refusal could be construed to be restraint of trade. NCAHF advises prudent consumers to contact the UHMS if they wish to check out the validity of claims related to HBO therapy, or to locate a qualified practitioner through the UHMS, 10531 Metropolitan Ave, Kensington, MD 20895-2627; Tele: 301-942-2980. Michael Jackson and HBO HBO appeared in a tabloid report showing a picture of Michael Jackson in a monoplace HBO chamber alleging that he slept in it to retard the aging process. The real story was that it was a publicity stunt. Jackson was about to embark upon a concert tour, and his publicist was looking for a good visual. Knowing Jackson had been treated with HBO therapy after the accidental burns he suffered while filming a Pepsi Cola commercial, the agent suggested that Jackson be wheeled out onto the stage in a hyperbaric chamber. Jackson subsequently either had his picture taken in such a chamber, or had a composite photo prepared for publicity purposes. There was no truth to the claim that he slept in such a device. Experts say that breathing 100% oxygen would cause severe toxicity to the lungs.

SENATOR HATCH GOES TO BAT FOR QUACKS AS INSURANCE FRAUD BILL IS DISCUSSED How Hatch helped thwart nutrition labeling reform. In 1983 the Senate's Special Committee on Aging determined that medical quackery was the #1 consumer fraud problem facing the nation's elderly. In 1984, Claude Pepper's Committee independently confirmed this finding. This inspired 3 national health fraud conferences in 1985, 1988, and 1990, and influenced the passage of the 1990 Nutrition Labeling and Education Act. However, when the reform efforts got around to dietary supplements, which are the locomotive that pulls quackery's train, the health food industry mustered its forces for an all-out attack on consumer protection reforms. They created a sense of public outrage by employing a big lie trick. They told vitamin-loving Americans: \"Don't let the FDA take away your vitamins!\" They even enlisted Hollywood stars Bruce Willis and Whoopi Goldberg, who appeared in a propaganda film declaring that the FDA intended to put all vitamins under prescription. The lie resulted in over a million letters to Congress. Hatch championed their cause on Capitol Hill, and in 1994, Congress passed the Hatch-Richardson bill which put \"dietary supplements\" (construed to include potent hormones and herbal drugs) beyond the reach of FDA regulation. Will Hatch subvert health insurance fraud reform? In 1992, the GAO estimated that health insurance fraud and abuse was costing the nation $70 billion. The FBI expanded its activities against health fraud, and in 1995, Director Louis Freeh told a Senate committee that health fraud costs the system $44 billion a year. It now appears that efforts to reform this area of abuse is again running headlong into the power of organized quackery on Capitol Hill. According to the April 18 Congressional Record, Senator Orrin Hatch expressed concerns to Senator Cohen about the establishment of a new health care fraud and abuse data collection program in Senate bill, Hatch stated: The alternative medicine community has expressed concerns about this provision. I have received communications from, for example, the American Preventive Medical Associationa and the National Nutritional Foods Associationb. While we are all supportive of strong efforts to weed out health care fraud and abuse, I hope that the Senator from Maine will agree that we do not want to create an opportunity for those who might want to eliminate or discourage alternative treatments by threatening fraud actions under the new language of the bill. Sen. Cohen assured Hatch that he has \"long been interested in promoting alternative medical treatments and I do not have any desire to enact a new law which might treat such providers unfairly.\" Hatch asked Cohen if he \"would... agree that the mere practice of unconventional or nonstandard therapies would not fall within the definition of fraud?\" Cohen answered that \"the practice of alternative medicine in itself would not constitute fraud.\" Fraud is \"an intentional perversion of truthc for the purpose of inducing another in reliance upon it to part wit h some valuable thing\" (Black's Law Dictionary). NCAHF agrees that the USE of unproven methods per se doesn't constitute fraud; rather, it is the promotiond of false and unproven remedies that leads patients to substitute them for standard health care. How does a practitioner get a patient to submit to a procedure without instilling a degree of confidence in it? Can this be done without some degree of \"perversion of truth\"? Legislators familiar with legal language can easily draft legislation with straightforward language that makes health fraud illegal. Hatch appears to be seeking to include weasel wordse that will exclude \"the alternative medicine community\" from accountability. aAn organization of chelationists. bA health food trade association. c\"a false representation of a matter of fact, whether by words or by conduct, by false or misleading allegations, or by concealment of that which should have been disclosed, whic h deceives or is intended to deceive another so that he shall act upon it.\"(Black's Law Dictionary) d Promote: \"to contribute to the growth or prosperity of; to present for public acceptance through advertising and publicity\" (Webster's Dictionary). e\"from the weasel's habit of sucking the contents out of an egg while leaving the shell superficially intact: a word used in order to evade or retreat from a direct or forthright statement or position.\" (Webster's Dictionary) [Hide Full Content](#twenty-nine-thousand-eight-hundred-thirteen) [NCRHI Issue #5 JOHN H.

ANOTHER ALT/COMP MED CLINIC CLOSES It was announced last July that the New York State University at Stony Brook would be closing its Center for Complementary / Alternative Medicine. because of money problems. Interviews with various medical faculty members were revealing as to why the clinic was opened in the first place. Dr. Fred Miller, chairman of the department of pathology, bemoaned the \"great waste of money\" involved in establishing the center. He noted that although he believed it was appropriate to do research on complementary medicine, the purpose of the Stony Brook operation was a business venture intended to cash in on the alleged popularity of alternative and complementary medicine. The Newsday (7/27/00) report stated that \"Despite its popularity with patients, alternative medicine has not been a money-maker for many universities or large medical centers, and many programs have scaled back or remain essentially academic centers with small clinics.\" One reason given for the failure of alt/comp med clinics is a lack of insurance coverage. To remedy this, Dr Samuel Benjamin, the center's director, talked to some health insurers about providing coverage, but the idea ran into strong opposition because it meant the appearance of endorsing therapies that were of unproved validity. FAILURE OF ALT MEDICINE CLINICS NO SURPRISE TO NCRHI The popularity of so-called \"alternative\" (etc) medicine is largely an illusion created by dubious data reported in medical journals which has been amplified by lazy journalists. The catalyst was the 1993 New England Journal of Medicine article by Eisenberg, et al, which claimed that their survey of the use of \"unconventional\" medicine in 1990 \"was far higher than previously reported.\" There were at least two major errors with this statement. First, it was false on its face; and second, the survey was so different that its results could not be compared with previous studies. The fact that this assertion was false was clear from merely reviewing the data from the studies cited by the authors. For instance, the authors cited the 1987 Harris and Associates study of the use of questionable health treatments. Harris found that 21% of American adults had used one or more unproven treatments for at least one of 15 different conditions (the list did not include weight loss per se, only \"to remove cellulite\") in the past year (1986). Far more used vitamins and herbs than were reported by Eisenberg. Less than 1% of Eisenberg respondents reported using folk remedies while 73% of the subjects in the study cited (Cook & Baisden, South Med J, 1986:79:1098+) used folk remedies. Further, Eisenberg studied the US population but cited data from the United Kingdom for comparison. These errors can only be attributed to shoddy oversight by the study's reviewers. The second point, that Eisenberg, et al could not legitimately compare their data with others because they did not categorize the kind of things people were doing in the same manner is very significant. Eisenberg's categories not only differed from what others have used when surveying the use of unorthodox health care methods, but did not accurately reflect what is generally thought to be \"medicine,\" unconventional or otherwise. According to Eisenberg, the most frequently used type \"unconventional therapy\" was undefined \"relaxation techniques.\" Third was \"massage.\" Neither of these qualify as medicine. Chiropractic use, which was second, was consistent with other studies, including reports by the main chiropractic trade association. I have been interviewed scores of times by the media on the alleged popularity of alternative medicine. I have asked numerous reporters about their source of the data on the extent of the use of alt/comp med. Without exception, they cited secondary sources (ie, other media reports). Not one had even read the original Eisenberg report, much less critically analyzed it to check out its validity. Thus, the media blitz on the alleged popularity of unconventional (aka \"unorthodox,\" \"alternative,\" \"complementary,\" \"non-traditional\") medicine has been largely an illusion. The reality is that patients with real or imagined health problems tend to try a wide variety of products, services, or lifestyle practices. The more long-term the problem, the greater variety will be the speculative remedies. This is simply self-care. The data on questionable health behavior (ie, the use of unproven methods by consumers) is quite consistent. People are willing to try new techniques if someone they trust speaks well of them. Thus, there it is no surprise that most recent surveys have found an increased use of methods that have been highly touted in the media. But, it doesn't take long for consumers with real health problems to make up their minds as to whether or not they are being helped. The reports of satisfaction by users have not been supportive of unconventional methods. The failure of alt/comp and integrative medicine clinics is an indication that some administrators did not do their homework before investing in such clinics. A regrettable aspect of this modern day fiasco is that it is nearly impossible to fund a nonprofit program such as that of NCRHI that could have saved millions of dollars that have been squandered on these misguided clinics. RISKS OF STANDARD VS NONSTANDARD MEDICAL CARE In 1998 researchers at the University of Toronto reported that adverse drug reactions affected an estimated 2.2 million hospitalized patients, and 106,000 of these were fatal. Earlier this year, the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine reported that between 44,000 and 100,000 Americans die each year as the result of medical errors. In September, a Chicago Tribune report stated that \"registered nurses have long been responsible for more patient deaths and injuries each year than any other health care professional.\" To track nursing errors, the Tribune analyzed computer records from the FDA, Dept of HHS, federal and state files of hospital records, complaint investigations, court and private health care files, and nurse disciplinary records. It was found that since 1995 at least 415 patients have been killed, and 1,356 injured by RNs operating infusion pumps. At least 216 patient deaths and 429 injuries occurred when RNs failed to hear warning alarms built into life-saving equipment. Another 119 patients have been killed and 564 others injured by unlicensed, unregulated nurse aides, some of whom were low-wage earners used to augment or supplant high-paid RNs as cost cutting measures. Further, nationally the number of reported nursing errors have increased in each of the last five years coinciding with cutbacks due to economic crises that has left one in every four hospitals operating in the red. The thrust of this report is aimed at the pursuit of profit by the managed care system that supplanted medical professionalism in the mid-1990s. However, these data have not been lost on the promoters of alternative medicine who happily proclaim that no such data exist to indicate that their methods are as risky. But, NCRHI doesn't believe that it is fair to compare the risks of standard medicine with those of nonstandard methods for two reasons: differing standards of conduct and differing patient populations. Nonstandard practitioners and clinics do not keep records of the harm they do. On the contrary, NCRHI has documentation that such entities work hard at covering up and denying clinical wrongs. They have to because using nonstandard methods automatically puts them at risk of legal sanctions. The populations served by standard and nonstandard health care differ markedly. Hospitalized patients suffer from serious diseases and are extremely fragile. Patients who use nonstandard remedies come from the general population and are much healthier. As consumer advocates we are not naive or uncritical of the hazards of standard medicine, but we have learned to differentiate between the inadvertent harm done by medical errors and harms which occur when off-beat health care is done according to plan. Every procedure must be justified on the basis of a benefit-risk equation. A chiropractor who paralyzes a patient by manipulative therapy for neck pain cannot justify the risk because the benefit is so small by comparison. Nonstandard practices do not circumvent the risks of medicine, the add to such risks by introducing useless methods (including substitutes for immunization) that enable diseases to progress unchecked, involving therapies that have their own potential problems (manipulation can cause trauma, herbs or megavitamins can be toxic, acupuncture needles can injure, enema devices can puncture the colon or transmit pathogens, colonic irrigation can deplete electrolytes, and more). Publicity about the failings of standard medicine coupled with the favorable reports usually given to alternative medicine can combine to distort the public's perception of risks. Obviously, we need to know about the problems associated with standard health care so they can be addressed. But, the failure of the media to carefully examine the realities of the alternative medicine marketplace do a great public disservice. HERB-DRUG INTERACTIONS Mark Blumenthal reviewed the possible interactions between 47 different herbs and conventional drugs in the current HerbalGram 49, 2000, pp.52-63. Blumenthal is an herbal advocate who defends botanicals at every opportunity (aka an \"apologist\"). To be fair, Mark's defensiveness is sometimes justified when media reports sensationalize the risks of using certain herbal substances. Unlike some other herbal proponents, he is willing to acknowledge real problems. In other words, if Blumenthal admits to there being a potential problem with an herbal substance, there is good reason to take notice. His article is revised and reprinted from Interactions Between Herbs and Conventional Drugs: Introductory Considerations, in Herbs-Everyday Reference for Health Professionals published by the Canadian Pharmacists Association and the Canadian Medical Association, 2000. HERBAL SALES DOWN IN MASS MARKET Early in 1999, sales of herbal products began to slip in the mainstream stores. By the end of the year, the drop in sales was close to 3% after many years of gains. Biggest losers were multi-herb combinations which were down 35%, St John's wort down 26%, ginseng down 14%, and garlic down 9%. Sales in natural food stores and multilevel marketing channels continued to grow but at a lower rate. The continued growth in these markets is thought to reflect a stronger commitment on the part of patrons of these markets. Several herbal products showed substantial gains. Soy supplements led with a 340% increase in sales, followed by flax with a 177% increase, black cohosh increased 143%, milk thistle sales were up 49%, and saw palmetto had a 34% gain. [Market Report, HerbalGram 49, p.68] BOOK DELIVERS ON WHAT USUALLY IS AN UNFULFILLED PROMISE TO BRIDGE GAP BETWEEN STANDARD AND \"NATURAL\" MEDICINE About the author. Dan Labriola was once a licensed mechanical and aerospace engineer, commercial and experimental pilot and flight instructor, and president of two aviation-related companies. When the Boeing layoffs hit hard a few back, Dan went looking for a new career in health care. He chose naturopathy because it was a shorter route to becoming a practitioner-a serious factor for an older adult. Dan got his ND degree from what is now Bastyr University, and worked directly with its namesake, John Bastyr. He was the first Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Department of Health for Alternative and Complementary Medicine, and Chair of the Naturopathic Advisory Committee for the State of Washington's Department of Health-and more. Through all of his education and practice, Dan has been true to his scientific principles and has found a niche within the standard medical community. He also has the intellectual capacity to understand complex medical science and technology-which is not usually true of people who choose naturopathy for a career. Dan has been a force trying to turn naturopathy into a legitimate form of \"low-tech\" health care that emphasizes healthy lifestyles, preventive medicine, and has the good sense and skill to refer patients to medical specialists when serious illness strikes. Dan is located in Seattle, an area with more than its fair share of \"greens\" and New Age types who are suspicious of anything that smacks of science and technology. Thus, Dan sees a substantial number of patients who fit into the category of those alienated from standard medicine. In several instances, he has been able to convince the parents of children with cancer to use effective standard therapies-along with the \"natural\" ones that they prefer. This is not simply a mixing of remedies, but involves a scheduling of therapies in such a way as to avoid potential negative interactions between diet and herb remedies and standard medications. In November, 1999, he and oncologist Robert Livingston, MD, Chief of Oncology at the University of Washington Medical Center, published an article in Oncology that discussed the problems that may arise when cancer patients mix potent antioxidants with cancer treatments that rely upon free radical formations to do their work. This work was not well received by some clinics that load patients up on anti-oxidants based upon the simplistic notion that the benefits will be additive instead of contradictory. Now Dan has published a book that truly combines, as its title declares, Complementary Cancer Therapies with so-called \"alternative\" approaches for, ...well, the hypesters in the marketing department say \"for the best possible outcomes,\" but Dan would never make such a glowing promise. However, his advice could certainly avoid harm that can come from misapplying combinations of questionable and standard approaches. In addition to advice on avoiding such harms, Dan educates patients about issues they will face as they undergo treatment for, and work and living with their predicament. This is a book worth having for any physician with patients who are vulnerable to the siren call of so-called \"natural remedies.\" The book is published by Prima Health, a division of Prima Publishing, 3000 Lava Roseville, CA 95661; tel: 800-632-8676; Internet: www.primahealth.com. ACS'S GUIDE TO COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE CANCER METHODS The American Cancer Society (ACS) has been the best single source of information on questionable cancer methods for many years. Beginning in 1915, the ACS gathered information on quackery by what came to be called the Ad Hoc Committee on Quackery. In 1954, the name was changed to the Committee on New and Unproven Methods of Treatment. In 1970, the word \"treatment\" was replaced with \"management\" to include dubious methods of diagnosis and prevention: The Committee on Unproven Methods of Cancer Management. In 1989, the name was changed to the Committee on Questionable Methods of Cancer Management in order to differentiate between unproven methods that were not seen as promising and experimental methods that were moving through the scientific system. In 1995, the name was changed again to the Subcommittee on Alternative and Complementary Methods of Cancer Management. Through all of these name changes, the work of the committee has remained the same-to examine unapproved, unpromising methods of cancer management and to warn patients not to use them. Its new guide, in my view, reflects the ACS's new approach to reaching the public on a populist level. Instead of the hard scientific facts and strong condemnation of medical nonsense, the intent seems to be to reach people where they are (ie, misinformed, confused, frightened and wary), at to provide them with information that will avoid serious harm. Combined with the book by Dan Labriola, ND, reviewed in another part of this issue of the NCRHI Newsletter, the guide contains on several hundred substances, healing philosophies, therapies, techniques, resources, and so forth; and, is a useful addition to the armamentarium of those who much face patients in today's \"real world.\" The guide is available from the ACS, Health Content Products, 1599 Clifton Rd, NE, Atlanta, GA 30329; 800-ACS-2345. BUSH CAMPAIGN ENCOUNTERS NOTORIOUS HEALTH HUCKSTER Politicians are easy targets for quacks. They have to pretty much be nice to everyone, and are always happy to receive donations to their campaigns. Some may recall a story about a New York Chinese Medicine huckster (she was hawking a secret remedy that turned out to be a cheap bottle of aspirin being sold for $60 a pop) who attended a fundraiser for Bill Clinton and used a photo of herself and the President to legitimize what she was doing. Well, a similar thing has happened to GOP candidate George Bush, Jr. Glen Braswell, a convicted felon, donated $175,000 to the Republican Party and $100,000 directly to the Bush Campaign. After discovering the source, both returned the money, but the gestures paid off for Braswell in the form of a article published in his promotional literature that carried Florida Governor Jeb Bush's name as author. The article promoted dubious dietary supplements by attributing statements to Bush that had been added without his permission or knowledge. Readers have no doubt seen Glen Braswell's slick, four-color promotional literature. More of his publications are sent to the NCRHI office by consumers suspicious of quackery than any other. Braswell's marketing is done under the name of Gero Vita International, and appear under a variety of names, including Gero Vita Laboratories, Life Force Laboratories, Vita Industries, Health Quest Publications, and under the name of a numerous MDs and/or PhDs. Some are renegades with a clear history of quackery, others are obscure, made famous by Braswell's proliferate activities. Braswell has called some of his promotions \"journals,\" (eg, Journal of Longevity Research, Journal of Longevity). These publications are clearly (and cleverly) aimed at aging baby-boomers. The promotions are very much like the ones that got Braswell in legal trouble in the past. In the late 1970s and early 80s, Braswell marketed baldness remedies, breast enlargers, anti-aging and weight-loss products through a magazine, Body Forum, that disguised advertising hype as editorial articles. In 1984, an official said that the Postal Service had received 138 false representation complaints against 50 different products marketed by Braswell, Inc. Braswell was convicted of mail fraud and was sentenced to 5 years probation. In addition, he was sentenced to a 3-year prison term for income tax evasion (Ed. Is the court's message that cheating consumers is less egregious than cheating the IRS of its share of the gains? Hmmm.) The link to the Bush brothers caught the fancy of Newsweek, whose reporter interviewed former NCAHF president and founder, William Jarvis. Jarvis told the reporter that in his view, Braswell is an artist who does the best at what he does, which is to create the illusion of that super health can be gained through buying the pills he peddles. I don't see that he is any worse than those slick ads by major pharmaceutical companies which huckster dietary supplements and tell people that in addition to vitamins they need garlic, gingko, ginseng, CoEnzyme Q10, and other speculative ingredients. When it comes to quackery, no political party is any worse than the other. Both quackery and politics are fertile fields for well-heeled hucksters, populists, and demagogues.

Volume 13, Issue #6 HOW HEALTH FRAUD WORKS A group of feature articles by The Kansas City Star (6/10/90), \"Doctors of Deceit,\" reveals common ways that health fraud is perpetrated by doctors, pharmacists, chiropractors, and hospitals. Some of the tactics described were unbundling: separating a procedure into several steps and billing for each; upcoding: exaggerating the services provided; ping-ponging: bouncing patients back and forth between doctors; generic drug switching by pharmacists; false billing, and double billing. Patients also cheat by faking accidents (in collusion with crooked attorneys and doctors or chiropractors) and by collecting on multiple policies. This article increases one's vocabulary on health fraud and also helps distinguish health fraud from quackery per se. Grouped with this article is another which points out that most crooked doctors go unpunished, and still another that presents the fascinating case of Harold Hopkins who, although he already had a doctorate in biology, became a chiropractor and made a science out of ripping off the system. He and his wife (a minister's daughter) are both doing time for insurance fraud. Described as well-educated, church-going people who led Boy Scouts and taught underprivileged children to read, the Hopkins' story is a sad case of white collar crime. MAGICIANS WHO EXPOSED FRAUD Psychologist Dr. Loren Pankratz describes the evolution of magic as originally used to control and enslave people, to entertain, and eventually to perform the socially useful function of exposing fraud. The author provides a bibliography of books written by magicians for the purpose of educating and warning the public. Included are fascinating insights into the personalities and experiences of many of the world's greatest conjurers. Pankratz discusses the tension within the magician's community regarding the use of deception as entertainment versus personal influence. He states that magicians perform an important benefit to society by reminding people of their vulnerability to deception. (The Linking Ring, December, 1989). TONING TABLES FAIL TEST Devices promoted by health spas called \"toning tables\" employ the theory that continuous assistive-passive exercise (CAPE) will achieve a significant measure of physical fitness. A test of CAPE divided 43 sedentary, postmenopausal women into three groups: (1) CAPE training (N=15); cycle ergometer (N=14); and, (3) control (N=14). The CAPE training consisted of 10 minute bouts on six CAPE tables twice per week. The CAPE group did not improve in body girth measurement and actually decreased in oxygen uptake (a most important measure of aerobic fitness in which more, not less, is better). (Martin D, Kauwell GP. Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, 22:(4):523-527, 1990.) Comment: \"Passive-exercise\" is a contradiction of terms. Flexibility can be improved by passive stretching, but this has no effect upon strength or endurance. Claims to the contrary are extraordinary because they contradict an enormous body of research in exercise physiology. Remember that extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. ILLINOIS DC ACKNOWLEDGES CHIROPRACTIC FAILINGS Mark Sanders, DC a practicing Illinois chiropractor, and former chiropractic school instructor, writes: \"If you suspect that diagnostic shortcomings and therapeutic abuses still plague the profession, you're right!\" in Medical Economics (9/17/90). Dr. Sanders says that while he believes that spinal manipulation is bona fide therapy for selected patients with back, muscle and nerve problems, \"a lot of chiropractic is a sham.\" Sanders details typical, common abuses by DCs including inadequate diagnoses, abuse of X-rays, treating according to Palmer's original single-cause of disease concept, use of bizarre nonscientific procedures, reliance upon dubious methods taught be \"practice builders\" to build up business, and more. Response from the chiropractic guild has been disappointing. Some DCs are crying-out to have Sanders' license revoked. They moan that it would be all right for him to criticize chiropractic from within but do not wish to have their dirty laundry aired in public. Others deny that his criticisms are valid, claiming they are outdated. One expressed relief that the article appeared in a medical journal rather than a popular magazine. Comment: None of what Sanders says is news to followers of the chiropractic enterprise-these abuses are widespread and contemporary. What is commendable is that a DC will publicly acknowledge abuses. DCs have yet to learn that open criticism of one's own peers is an essential part of the scientific process. Abuses by medical doctors are exposed by other physicians in the publications of organized medicine (that's were doctor-bashers find grist for their mills). It is the public-relations minded DCs who prevent progress by stonewalling the failings of their guild. Sanders gives chiropractic more credibility by his frankness than all of his DC-critics have ever generated by their self-serving promotions. HEALTH TEXTBOOKS FAIL TO WARN ABOUT QUACKERY NCAHF President William Jarvis was asked by the California Textbook League (CTL) to evaluate the coverage given quackery in health textbooks used in California schools. The CTL asked Dr. Jarvis to develop a set of criteria a priori and then apply their inventory of health texts. Six textbooks were evaluated using the letter-grading system familiar to educators. Grading ranged from C+ to F. Being Healthy (1990) by Harcourt Brace Janovich received the highest grade and Addison-Wesley Health and Safety (1989) flunked for not even mentioning quackery. Jarvis not only reviewed portions of the textbooks that dealt directly with quackery but looked at sections on consumerism that may have provided useful information on self-protection even if quackery wasn't mentioned by name. (\"Health texts fail to warn of quackery and its perils,\" The Textbook Letter, 1:(3):1+, July-August, 1990.) Note: The publication of the textbook review was timely to be used as a handout at a presentation on the harmful impact of quackery upon children given on October 17 by Dr. Jarvis at the Annual Convention of the American School Health Association. Dr. William London, President of the Ohio Council Against Health Fraud presided. TANNING PARLOR REGULATION It is estimated that more than one million Americans per day utilize tanning parlors in which they are exposed to some UVA lamps that generate more than five times the UVA radiation reaching the Earth's equator. Dermatologists are concerned about the potential for injury and long-term damage to the health of users. This is the topic of an article entitled: \"Tanning Parlor Regulation: A Paradigm for Physician Involvement in Public Health Issues,\" (State Health Legislation Report, 18:(2):1-12. Summer, 1990). CONSUMERS' UNION PUBLISHES NEW ANTI-QUACKERY BOOK Health Schemes, Scams & Frauds by Stephen Barrett, MD, and the editors of Consumer Reports Books, will be published in December, 1990 and ready for shipment in mid-January. It covers arthritis quackery, dubious cancer therapy, fringe medicine, \"fad\" diagnoses, chiropractic, the dental mercury amalgam scam, weight control fraud, real vs. bogus allergies, and many other topics. The price will be $13 plus $2 or $3 for postage. However, advance buyers can get the book for $13 postpaid from LVCAHF, Inc. P.O. Box 1747 Allentown, Comment: As a reviewer of the prepublication drafts, I can assure readers that this book is the \"state of the art\" anti-quackery book for consumers. William Jarvis, Editor. VIRGINIA LIVINGSTON-WHEELER DEAD AT 84 Virginia Livingston-Wheeler, owner and operator of infamous Livingston Clinic in San Diego, died this past June of heart failure while on a European tour. VLW purported to have discovered a bacterium which she believed to be the cause of cancer. She dubbed her pet Progenitor cyptocides (PC). Scientists who looked into her microscope merely saw a variety of common bacterium. VLW's explanation was that PC was \"pleomorphic\" (appearing many different forms). VLW alleged to cultivate patient's urine and develop an anti-cancer vaccine and prescribed megadoses of vitamins which were sold at her office window. VLW was ordered to cease and desist her dubious cancer treatments in February, 1990 (see NCAHF Newsletter, March-April, p.5). QUESTIONABLE DOCTORS BOOK The national media widely covered the book 6892 Questionable Doctors compiled by the Public Citizen Health Research Group (PCHRG) in June, 1990. NCAHF obtained a copy and checked it against its own listing of physicians guilty of serious misconduct do not appear. This limits the book's value as a reference source because some very bad actors could slip through if this were the only net used for screening. This failing is not the fault of PCHRG. It was limited to information supplied by state licensing boards. We agree with PCHRG's conclusion that there is too little discipline being done. However, rather than simply bashing the licensing boards or organized medicine for this failure, we believe that the real problem is that behind every successful quack is a shyster lawyer keeping him/her in practice. The lawyers intimidate professional critics into silence, and manipulate the legal system which has always been too lenient with white collar crime. The book includes a section on how to use it. It recommends a series of actions to take if \"the doctor you are considering is listed here.\" Our guess is that most people will stop there. The actions recommended are too cumbersome for most people to follow through on. The section gives useful information on how to file a complaint. The book's description of the U.S. \"system\" of medical quality control is revealing. It is described as a \"patchwork system\" which is \"largely uncoordinated and ineffective.\" Its' expose of the dismal status of consumer protection is, we believe, the book's greatest asset. Comment: The questionable doctors book is a worthy project, but falls far short of what is needed to serve as a guide to help consumers avoid questionable doctors. Further, naturopathic, homeopathic, chiropractic licensing boards, whose practitioners have an appalling tradition of health fraud and quackery, don't even have a compulsory national registry for wrongdoers. PHARMACISTS' SUPPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS SURVEY A survey of pharmacists and their practices in the USA vs the UK found that 40% of US vs 28.6% of UK pharmacists recommended vitamin-mineral supplements more than 5 times per week. A large number placed the non-specific symptoms of fatigue and stress in the 5 most common reasons why they recommend supplements. (J Clin Pharm & Therap, 15:131-139, 1990) COMPLETE BOOK ON NUTRITION A landmark publication, The Mount Sinai School of Medicine Complete Book of Nutrition (St. Martin's Press, 1990) is hot off the press. Edited by Victor Herbert, MD, and Genell Subak-Sharp, this tome has more than three dozen contributors. Comprehensive, authoritative, and most important, easy-to-read, this book provides a resource to anyone interested in reliable nutrition information. Price: approximately $35 in hardback. COLORADO OUTLAWS USE OF PHONY DEGREES Colorado has added itself to a growing list of states that outlaw the use of diploma mill credentials to claim expertise. House Bill 90-1090 classifies as deceptive trade practices as claiming either orally or in writing to possess either an academic or honorary degree, or the title associated with said degree, unless the person has been awarded said degree from an institution that is accredited by a regional or professional accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education or the council on post-secondary accreditation. There are other categories that qualify too lengthy to detail here, but the new law clearly outlaws the false labeling of individuals with bogus credentials. MICHIGAN COURT RULES AGAINST THERMOGRAPHY USE BY CHIROPRACTORS Judge Kaye Tertzag, Wayne County (Michigan) Circuit Court ruled on August 29, 1990 that Thermography devices were not within the scope of chiropractic; do not locate subluxations; are for differential diagnosis only; and, are not scientifically valid to monitor physiology. Thermoscribe, NCM, and dermathermograph are even less reliable than infrared or liquid crystal thermography. Hofman v Auto Club Insurance Case #85-500355 CZ. BIG GREEN AND BIG LIES Big Green (California Proposition 128), the radical environmentalist's solution to pollution, lost big at the polls. No one knows for certain why, but the best-guessers are pointing to voter's rejection of every initiative that cost more money and everybody seemed to agree that the cost of Big Green would have been astronomical. It would be nice to be able to report that the reason Californians rejected Big Green was because they saw through the sham, but there is no evidence to support that idea. Big Green's promoters used big lies which may reverberate around the state for some time to come. In speeches, Tom Hayden would hold up a red shiny apple and state that it had been grown without Alar. He declared that \"they\" (the defenders of Alar) said that apples \"couldn't be raised without Alar; that apples would be little shriveled up things that no one would eat. You can see,\" he would add, \"this is a perfectly good apple.\" He lied. Alar was used to help keep ripening apples on the tree and to keep them firm and red during post-harvest storage. None said that apples would change in appearance. However, there are some common food crops that may become a luxury if pesticides were regulated by the unrealistic (and unnecessary to protect health) standards that would have been imposed by Big Green. The most appalling, despicable, and cynical lie by Big Green's backers was the misuse of a child with cancer who, bald from chemotherapy, appeared in TV-spots implying that her cancer was caused by pesticide residues, whimpering \"I cannot vote, but you can.\" A TV-news interview with the little girl's parents revealed that her mother had been an activist for an environmental group during the anti-Alar campaign. The mother stated that when her little girl came down with cancer, she offered the child to the promoters of Big Green. What exploitation! What a travesty! There is no reason whatever to connect any child's cancer to pesticide residues, but this big lie was broadcast throughout California. Anti-Big Green TV-spots featured former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, MD who stated that he had spent his entire life working on behalf of the health of mothers and children, and that if he believed Proposition 128 would protect their health he would be in favor of it, but that it would not and he was not. He stated that he believed that public policy should be based upon science, not scare tactics. Koop's message was an abbreviated way of saying that public health measures, which have done so much to deliver the record longevity Americans presently enjoy, are dependent upon science and technology. Included are not only immunization, fluoridation and pasteurization, but food production methods that make an abundant, varied supply of safe, nutritious foods available the year around at low cost. Radical environmentalists have made themselves blind to the truth regarding the high health status of the nation. Good nutrition is one of the cornerstones of public health. Our guess is that the apocalyptic environmental radicals will go back to a strategy of picking off one technology at a time, as they did with Alar, rather than attempting the shotgun approach represented by Big Green. They will capitalize upon the public distrust engendered by these big lies which undoubtedly still smolders in the minds of many Californians. A good review of Big Green's fallacies appears in the Fall, 1990 issue of Priorities. MIRACLE AT LOMA LINDA? National media reports proclaimed that a miracle had occurred at Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) in which an infant born with a hypoplastic left-heart syndrome (HLHS) and small mitral and aortic valves who was awaiting a transplant suddenly became normal. The implication was that a paranormal healing event had occurred. In fact, a remarkable event did take place, but the word \"miracle\" only applies in a non-paranormal sense. Doctors monitoring a 2-month-old boy awaiting a heart transplant for several weeks realized changes were taking place never seen before in dozens of infants with HLHS monitored at LLUMC, nor had any such thing appeared in the literature. In time, the heart had grown to nearly normal and the mitral valve, though small, was sufficient. Surgery still had to be performed to remove a constriction in the aorta. No one at LLUMC suggested that a paranormal event had occurred. Such an interpretation occurred in some people's minds because LLUMC is a Christian hospital. Specialists at LLUMC pointed out that the baby's HLHS had been atypical at the outset, and that this type of growth and development should not be expected in typical HLSH cases. (LLU Today, 10/24/90). ARTICLE DETAILS BIZARRE CRANIAL MANIPULATION METHOD USED ON LEARNING DISABLED CHILDREN Russell S. Worrall, OD, details the bizarre cranial manipulation method, \"Neural Organizational Technique\", promoted by a New York chiropractor that was used on learning disabled children in Crescent City, California (see NCAHF Newsletter, p.3, March-April, 1988). NCAHF considers this case to be an outstanding example of irresponsible action on the part of school officials entrusted with the well-being of children. Dr. Worrall's article provides insight into what transpired during that sad affair. (The Skeptical Inquirer, 15:40-50, Fall, 1990). ONE-A-DAY VITAMIN ADS RULED DECEPTIVE The FTC has charged Miles, Inc. with making unsubstantiated claims in their ads for One-A-Day Vitamins. The FTC complaint cites the following claims: - \"Strenuous exercise can actually knock essential minerals right out of your system. But One-A-Day vitamins are formulated to help put back what your world takes away.\" - \"One-A-Day vitamins are uniquely formulated to put back what your stressful world takes away....\" - \"Defending your lungs against air pollution requires vitamins A,E and C. Daily stress can chip away at your B vitamins.\" Miles, Inc. has signed a consent agreement to stop making such claims in the absence of scientific data for support. (FTC News, 10/24/90; FTC File #902 3010) SOCIETY TO BE PLAGUED BY CRANK ECOLOGY BOOKS Diet books are always leaders in the popular trade market, and the slant they take seems to follow trends (eg, hypoglycemia, weight loss, fiber, low cholesterol, immune system enhancement). The new trend emphasizes environmental concerns. Harvey Diamond has extended his area of non-expertise to include world food production and the environment. David Steinman, who appears to be a follower of the cult of L Ron Hubbard (Scientology) has written Diet for a Poisoned Planet that is loaded with health misinformation and scary falsehoods. Steinman advocates a \"detoxification\" or \"purification\" program which includes megadoses of niacin, saunas and exercise to purge body toxins invented by Hubbard and promoted by Health Med, a Scientology-linked agency. The FDA issued a \"talk paper\" on 10/19/90 which states that Steinman distorts health statistics and FDA's data in his book. The bandwagon is rolling and all manner of strange people seem to be following the adage: If you see a movement coming, get out in front and pretend to be leading it! ALTERNATIVE CANCER PATIENTS SHOW LOWER SURVIVAL The Bristol Cancer Help Center (BCHC) was set up in 1979 to offer a variety of alternative therapies in the United Kingdom. Included is a stringent diet of raw and partly cooked vegetables with proteins from soya and pulses. The ideology of BCHC is that cancer patients can contribute to the healing process in an active way. BCHC offers counseling, \"healing,\" and alternative therapies claimed to enhance quality of life and a positive attitude to cancer. The BCHC staff and patients felt a need to validate scientifically the results they felt had been achieved. They invited in a team of doctors and scientists who came up with two studies; one to compare survival and the other quality of life. The survival study ran from June, 1986 to June, 1988 and followed 334 women with breast cancer attending the BCHC for the first time between June, 1986 and October, 1987. Controls were 461 breast cancer patients attending a specialist hospital or two district general hospitals. 85% of the BCHC patients were under age 55 at diagnosis, more than half had experienced recurrence before entry. For patients metastasis-free at entry, survival was significantly (2.85 ratio) poorer in the BCHC group. Survival was also significantly poorer among relapsed patients in the BCHC group (1.81 ratio). Researchers note that substitution of the BCHC program for standard therapy is not an issue since few patients had rejected conventional treatments. It is possible that some important difference exists between patients selecting BCHC and the controls. The BCHC patients seem to exhibit a stronger commitment to healthful living since far fewer smoked than normal, and 41% were already using alternative therapies (ie, diet or \"healing\") upon entry to BCHC. It is possible that the radical diet actually shortened patient's lives. (The Lancet, pp.606-610, Sept 8,1990) Comment: The BCHC study provides some important lessons. First, the BCHC staff obviously felt that something worthwhile was happening to patients in their program. The lesson to be learned from this is that subjective observations are deceptive. People view selectively tending to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative. Objective analysis can be heartbreaking when it fails to confirm what seems like a good thing. Second, this experience underlines the fact that many people engaged in cancer quackery are sincere. They have had experiences that reinforce their belief that something real and good is happening to patients using their remedies. The lesson here is that sincerity and good intentions are not enough; only objective, critical analysis can determine the real value of therapies. \"The great tragedy of science is the slaying of a beautiful idea by an ugly fact.\" Huxley RX FOR EXTREMISM: MORE SKEPTICISM, LESS CYNICISM Skeptic: \"... taken from the Greek word skeptomai which merely meant to 'look at something carefully'\" and 'examine' and 'consider' it.\" Funk C. Word Publ Co, 1978. Cynic: A faultfinding captious* critic; one who believes that human conduct is motivated wholly by self-interest. *Marked by an often ill-natured inclination to stress faults and raise objections. Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, 1975. NCAHF founders rejected Ralph Nader's adversarial approach that delineates \"consumers\" versus \"industry\" as separate classes of people because it encourages cynicism rather than the much-needed skepticism, in its original meaning. True skepticism is the essence of the science that must undergird our regulatory system in our capitalistic democracy. All of us have a stake in safe and effective health care, safe food and water, and a healthful environment. The same error is made when \"environmentalism\" and \"industry\" are posited as separate classes. This message was clear in TV \"sound bites\" during California's recent political campaign: if industry had input into the initiative, no more need be said, it couldn't be trusted. NCAHF believes that we would all be well-advised to take a skeptical rather than a cynical approach to our ecological problems. Just as in consumerism, rational regulatory policies are needed, not extremism. We advocate skepticism in these matters. Cynically posing business as completely untrustworthy serves no useful purpose. Nevertheless, we are firm supporters of government regulation. \"BUCCANEER ENTREPRENEURIALISM\" NCAHF founders rejected Ralph Nader's adversarial approach that delineates \"consumers\" versus \"industry\" as separate classes of people as wrongheaded in a free enterprise society such as ours. Consumerism works best by supporting regulatory policies founded in science and consumer protection law. NCAHF is not anti-business, but we deplore the business philosophy popularized by Milton Friedman in his book Free to Choose. Victor Herbert dubbed this business philosophy \"buccaneer entrepreneurialism\" at the 1990 National Health Fraud Conference. We think that it is a term worth remembering. Friedman became a guru of a kind of cult of Adam Smith that asserts that a free marketplace will automatically sort the good products and services from the bad. Former President Ronald Reagan is a notable disciple. Reagan brought devotees of the cult to Washington. They were the people who put the FTC on its misguided course of threatening professional health organizations which oppose competing quack organizations with anti-trust; stopped FDA from banning raw milk in interstate commerce until forced to do so by court action; allowed health claims for foods; lowered the standards used by FCC to control abuses within broadcasting which eventually led to \"infomercials\" that even Reagan's own son used to sell snake-oil band-aid weight loss patches; pillaged HUD, and the S&L's. Some regulatory reforms were advised when Reagan took office, but no one had called for deregulation in health (Kennedy, Health Affairs, 2:39-51, 1983). Reagan has boasted of the new small businesses that started under his tenure. Unfortunately, a portion of those business are the multilevel health scams that advance the \"freedom of choice\" battle cry. The freedom the buccaneers desire is their own freedom from accountability. Buccaneer entrepreneurialism is a libertarian philosophy advocating \"buyer beware\" in which victims are blamed for their folly when outsmarted by shrewd entrepreneurs. GOLDEN PRIDE PRODUCTS Golden Pride Products is a West Palm Beach, Florida company that markets its product line by a multilevel scheme.

[The Letter, 4/98; The Lawrence Review of Natural Products, 11/96; Pacific Information on Street Drugs, 5/77] RIPPED FUEL LINKED TO TWO DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA NCAHF has learned of two recent deaths that are blamed on the dietary supplement Ripped Fuel. - 15-year-old Rosanna Porras collapsed during soccer practice in April and died three days later never regaining consciousness. Rosanna was president of her class, trim, healthy, and full of life. She had taken Ripped Fuel just before practice to boost her energy. - The other death involved a 38-year-old man who had been advised by his doctor to lose weight and begin an exercise program. He complied, lost 40+ lbs, and was exercising regularly. He collapsed and died following a regular bout of exercise in the presence of his young daughter. Ripped Fuel is manufactured by Twin Laboratories, Inc., of Ronkonkoma, NY. As its name implies, Ripped Fuel is sold as an athletic performance enhancer (aka ergogenic aid) and for weight loss. NCAHF has been told that Ripped Fuel is available in two different formulations. The original is sold in states where ephedrine is legal and the other formulation is for states where it is not. The original formulation contained ephedrine, kola, L-carnitine, and chromium picolinate. The recommended dose of 6 capsules per day (2 at each mealtime) would contain 60 mg ephedrine, 300 mg of caffeine (from kola), 300 mg of L-carnitine (a metabolite which is synthesized in the liver from lysine and methionine alleged, but unproven, to speed up the burning of body fat, and 600 mg chromium picolinate. The alternate formula eliminates the ephedrine, adds the amino acid phenylalanine, replaces the kola with guarana. Guarana has a relatively high caffeine content, ranging from 2.5% to 5% and averaging about 3.5%. An article in Muscular Development magazine published by Twin Labs, says that people shouldn't take caffeine before workouts because it raises blood pressure. This is strange because Ripped Fuel's label says to take it before workouts. Yet, its recommended daily dose has 900 mg caffeine (the equivalent to 6-8 cups of brewed coffee or 8-22 cups of instant coffee). California permits the marketing of the ephedrine-containing formula. The LA Times quotes the owner of the Cloud Nine Shoppe in Moodus, Connecticut as saying that \"the ephedrine-free products aren't nearly as good. There's no comparison. You hardly get anything out of them.\" [Chawkins. \"Death of 15-year-old fuels concern over energy pills,\" Los Angeles Times, 4/16/98:A3+] (Note. Another Ripped Fuel related death has been reported in Minnesota, but we have no details.) CHIROPRACTOR NOT LIABLE FOR FAILURE TO WARN OF ABNORMAL MASS On April 21, a Wisconsin appellate court ruled that chiropractor Mark Murray was not liable for Gerald Pilak's death from lung cancer because, unlike physicians, chiropractors are not licensed to diagnose medical problems. According to court records, Pilak sought Murray's services for neck, shoulder and back pain in 1992. Murray X-rayed Pilak and told him that the radiographs indicated that he needed a spinal adjustment. The X-ray also showed an abnormal mass near his spine that later was found to be cancer. Pilak died in 1994 at age 57. Pilak's family sued Murray for failing to point out the abnormal mass to Pilak. Doing so would have enabled Pilak to obtain earlier diagnosis and treatment which would have increased his chances of survival. However, now that they were in court, the plaintiffs ran smack into the letter of the law. The court stated that in Wisconsin chiropractors are limited to treating the spinal column and adjacent tissues. This does not include the lungs. The Pilak family attorney argued that if a chiropractor is trained to recognize what is normal on an X-ray, he should be able to recognize an abnormality and at least inform a patient about it so medical help can be sought. Murray's attorney and the court disagreed. [AP. \"Chiropractor not liable for lung cancer death,\" Kenosha News, 4/22/98] Comment. X-rays can show that a spine should NOT be manipulated, they cannot show that an \"adjustment\" is needed. Chiros do not need a reason to render a spinal \"adjustment.\" NCAHF board chairman Charles DuVall, DC, says \"When the only tool one has is a hammer, everything looks like a nail!.\" It is ironic that chiropractors are permitted to call themselves \"physicians\" in some states, and to foster the illusion that they are suitable primary health-care providers by training. But, when chiros are taken to court for malpractice, they fall back on the legal doctrine that puts the patient at his/her own risk. MDs who testify that the chiro failed to provide competent medical care are of little help because chiros are not held to medical standards of conduct. Chiros only have to show that they behaved as chiros. To properly inform the public, the state should require signs to be placed in chiros' offices informing citizens of the limitations of these licensed providers. WHEN GOVERNMENT GETS IN BED WITH PSEUDOSCIENCE, THINGS CAN GET KNOTTY The U.S. Dept of Agriculture (USDA) is retreating from proposals on \"organic food\" standards that would have allowed the use of irradiation, sewage sludge and bioengineered material (eg, genetically altered seeds to improve yield). According to Reuters News Service, 200,000 angry letters, Willie Nelson, and 48 members of Congress joined organic farmers in attacking the USDA's proposals. Never mind that the methods are safe, they are considered \"inappropriate.\" The straight truth is that \"organic foods\" are indistinguishable from conventional foods after they have been grown. When Congress passed the U.S. Organic Foods Production Act of 1990, it was pandering to the ignorance-induced anxiety of a neurotic segment of society worried about \"chemicals\" in their food. Never mind that modern agriculture and food technology are essential for feeding the growing population, and that part of population growth is attributable to the longevity revolution currently taking place around the world which is itself due to advances in science and technology. The Congress should be advancing rational science, not pandering to emotional food symbolism. In political language, it is a time to lead, not a time to follow.

CHOLESTIN \"SUPPLEMENT\" RULED TO BE A \"DRUG\" Cholestin is a variety of red yeast, Monascus purpureus, derived from fermented rice. It contains lovastatin, the same active ingredient found in Merck's prescription drug, Mevacor, which is one of a group of \"statin\" drugs used to lower cholesterol. After months of wrangling over the contradiction of allowing the marketing of an over-the-counter product that is indistinguishable from a prescription medication, on May 20, the FDA banned Cholestin as an OTC product. The manufacturer, Pharmanex of Simi Valley, Calif, has vowed to challenge the ban in court. A hearing has been scheduled for June 15. This court's decision is apt to have far-reaching effects by helping establish the limitations of the 1994 Dietary Supplements Health & Education Act. [Sources: \"The nondrug drug that lowers your cholesterol,\" UCB Wellness 1998; Reuters. \"FDA bans Cholestin,\" May 20, 1998] BURZYNSKI ANNOUNCES INTERIM RESULTS A Burzynski Research Institute (BRI) company press release announced on May 24 that its Antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1, used in combination, produced either complete tumor elimination or greater than 50% reduction in tumor size in 43 of 178 patients (24.1%). An additional 72 patients (40.5%) experienced stable disease, meaning that their tumors did not progress or shrink more than 50%. The two largest groups of patients suffered either from glioblastoma multiforme (36.5%) or astrocytoma-type tumors (32%). These results are exciting, the report said, because conventional treatments are generally considered ineffective against such tumors. BRI now believes it has enough data to apply for FDA approval. Comment. The study was forced on BRI by the government as part of an action taken more than two years ago. It will be interesting to see how other researchers respond to the BRI data. Information on brain tumors from the National Cancer Institute does not agree with the BRI statement that conventional therapy is ineffective [PDQ State-of-the-Art Cancer Treatment Summary for Health Professionals: Childhood cerebral astrocytoma, 7/97]. It can also be asked if the nature of the BRI produces any kind of a selection effect of the type of patients that are enrolled. For instance, does the travel and effort involved eliminate sicker patients in favor of those who may be surviving longer due to the nature of their diseases? There is also the matter of replication by another cancer research facility that doesn't have the emotional or financial self-interest of BRI. At this point, we can only hope that an effective treatment for brain tumors has been found. If it has, it will be a shame that it took action by the government, and so much time to get the testing done. DUBIOUS CANCER CURE FUELS ITALIAN POLITICAL STRIFE An 85-yr-old physician, Luigi Di Bella, promotes a cancer cocktail containing a mixture of vitamins, minerals, and the drug somatostatin. Somatostatin has been shown to have some effect on some rare neuroendocrine tumors, but not others. Di Bella, however, claims to have cured thousands of patients. Di Bella's supporters have joined forces with a right-wing political party, Alleanza Nazionale against the Italian Medical establishment. Those who demand medical evidence are being branded as \"left wing\" by the Di Bellans. The arguments and tactics sound very familiar to veterans of the Laetrile wars of the 1970s in the USA. In January, the Italian Minister of Health, Rosa Bindi, ordered Di Bella to submit his files for review. Di Bella refused, claiming that he could not expect a fair evaluation. Di Bella's supporters also rejected Bindi's offer to assemble an international panel of independent experts to evaluate Di Bella's data. Bindi has decided to spend $11 million US to conduct 10 clinical trials of the cocktail. Critics lament that the expenditure has not been properly justified by an expert review, and that such a large expenditure could do much more if applied to other public health problems. [Nature, 4/2/98] VITAMIN C PRO-OXIDANT Researchers at the UK's University of Leicester found in a 6-week study of 30 healthy men and women that a daily 500 mg vitamin C pill had pro-oxidant as well as antioxidant effects on DNA The vitamin C promoted genetic damage to the adenine bases of DNA that had not been previously measured (adenine to oxoadenine). The vitamin did protect the guanine bases (oxidation of guanine to oxoguanine). Researchers question the current promotion of vitamin C as an antioxidant based upon their findings. [Podmore, et al. \"Vitamin C exhibits pro-oxidant properties,\" Nature, 1998;392:559] Comment. Dr. Victor Herbert has been telling all who would listen this very thing for years. NCAHF has carried Herbert's message because he is experienced in the laboratory and clinical work of nutrition and biochemistry. USEFUL ARTICLE ON PATIENTS' USE OF HERBAL REMEDIES Consultation-liaison psychiatrists discuss the use of herbal remedies by patients who are struggling with the physical and emotional effects of acute or chronic disease, and have become disillusioned with conventional medical treatments and their health care providers. Such patients are prone to use alternative approaches to regain a sense of control or hope regarding their illnesses. This does not mean that they have become New Age devotees. Nearly all combine alternatives with their conventional medical care rather than abandoning the latter. This article focuses upon the risks of herbal remedy use rather than the behavioral aspects of the problem. The authors point out that both patients and physicians are apt to be ignorant of the true nature of herbal remedies. Such products are neither inactive placebos, benign, or without any therapeutic worth. On the contrary. Because of the potential for side effects, toxic reactions, and unwanted herb/drug interactions, physicians need to learn about the herbal medicines being used by their patients. The authors go on to supply a great deal of useful information on a number of popular herbal remedies. [Crone CC, Wide Psychosomatics, 1998;39:3-13] WIDESPREAD MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE CAUSES OF CANCER COST SOCIETY BILLIONS Molecular biologists Bruce Ames and Lois Gold, of the Carcinogenic Potency Project at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Center at the University of California, Berkeley, teamed up to debunk major misconceptions concerning the role of synthetic chemical pollutants as causes of cancer. Ames and Gold tackle nine major misconceptions: - Cancer rates are soaring. - Synthetic chemicals in the environment are an important cause of human cancer. - Reducing pesticide residues is an effective way to prevent diet-related cancer. - Human exposures to carcinogens and other potential hazards are primarily to synthetic chemicals. - Cancer risks to humans can be assessed by standard high-dose animal cancer tests. - Synthetic chemicals pose greater carcinogenic hazards than natural chemicals. - The toxicology of synthetic chemicals is different from that of natural chemicals. - Pesticides and other synthetic chemicals are disrupting human hormones. - Regulating low, hypothetical risks advances public health. Ames and Gold point out that regulations targeted to eliminate minuscle levels of synthetic chemicals cost society an estimated $140 billion per year. Attempting to reduce synthetic pesticides may make fruits and vegetables more expensive thereby decreasing their consumption and increasing cancer rates. A re-examination of priorities in cancer prevention is called for. [Ames B, Gold LS. \"Environmental pollution, pesticides, and the prevention of cancer: misconceptions,\" FASEB J 1997;11:1041-52] Comment. By tackling these misconceptions, Ames and Gold strike at the heart of the misinformation that furthers the interests of the health food industry, the organic food movement, herbology, renegade medicine, and others that profit from ignorance and misguided ideologies. The problem is that these notions are rooted in a basic fear of science which is as old as the legend about the fall of man being caused by eating of the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden. The human fear of science and technology has been reinforced by the literary notion of the \"mad scientist\" furthered by the story of Dr. Frankenstein (Mary Shelly, 1828), Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886), and the sinking of the Titanic. The Titanic was named for a group of lesser gods, the Titans, who dared to challenged the supremacy of Apollo. Apollo destroyed them for their arrogance. Thus, the Titanic disaster has become symbolic of human arrogance and the folly of human knowledge. The Bible also mocks the \"wisdom of the world\" in I Corinthians 1:20. Curiously, in that instance, the Apostle Paul was demeaning Greek mythology! SURVEY ON WHY PATIENTS USE ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE A researcher at the Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention set out to investigate possible predictors of alternative health care use. Three primary hypotheses were tested: (1) they are dissatisfied in some way with conventional treatment; (2) they see alternative treatments as offering more personal autonomy and control over health care decisions; and, (3) the alternatives are seen as more compatible with the patient's values, worldview, or beliefs regarding the nature and meaning of health and illness. A written survey was completed by 1,035 of 1,500 people randomly selected (69% response rate) from a nationally representative panel of persons who have agreed to participate in mail surveys for National Family Opinions, Inc.. The sample was slightly under-representative of younger, less educated, and poorer persons. Asked to list their top 3 most \"bothersome\" or \"serious\" health problems, the top 5 reported were: (1) back problems (19.7%); (2) allergies (16.6%); (3) sprains/muscle strains; (4) digestive problems (14.5%); and, (5) lung problems, pneumonia, or respiratory infections (13%). The top 4 treatment categories used were: (1) chiropractic (15.7%); (2) lifestyle diet (8.0%); (3) exercise/movement (7.2%); and (4) relaxation (6.9%). The most frequently-cited health problems treated with alternative therapies were: (1) chronic pain (37%); (2) anxiety, chronic fatigue syndrome, and \"other health condition\" (31% each); (3) sprains/muscle strains (26%); (4) addictive problems and arthritis (both 25%); and, (5) headaches (24%). Only 4.4% of the sample relied primarily upon alternative health care. Conclusion. Along with being more educated and reporting poorer health status, the majority of alternative medicine users appear to be doing so not so much as a result of being dissatisfied with conventional medicine but largely because they find these health care alternatives congruent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations toward health and life. [Astin JA, \"Why patients use alternative medicine,\" JAMA, 1998;279:1548-53]. Comment. The study seemed geared to draw out congruence with expressions of holistic philosophy and self-descriptions representative of \"cultural creatives\" identified by Ray (see NCAHF Newsletter, Jan-Feb, 1997:3) which were presented in such a positive manner that many would find something with which they could identify. As a result, the study appears to overestimate the proportion of the population who use alternative medicine on the basis of philosophical congruence. CHITOSAN Chitin is a cellulose-like biopolymer found in the exoskeletons of marine creatures such as shrimp, crabs, and lobsters. The processing of squid in New Zealand provides an inexpensive source of chitin as a waste by-product. Deacylated chitin is called chitosan. Chitosan is unique in that, unlike plant cellulose that is negatively charged, it possesses positively charged amino groups that bind to negatively charged lipid and bile components. It can bind 4 to 6 times its weight in greases, oils and toxic substances and has been used in water purification plants for about 30 years for such purposes. Chitosan has also been used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries for a variety of purposes. The substance has recently been promoted as a weight loss agent based upon its ability to absorb fatty acids and bile in the gut to prevent their uptake. Although a review of the literature did not mention weight loss due to chitosan, a cholesterol-reducing effect is mentioned. People with shellfish allergy and women who are pregnant are warned to check with their doctors before using. The chemical composition of chitosans varies, which may affect its toxicity. [Lawrence Review of Natural Products, 3/98]DEATH OF A NUTRITION ENTHUSIASTAnne Frahm's breast cancer was widely disseminated by the time it was diagnosed. She underwent surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and hormone therapy. When these failed to send her disease into remission, she underwent an experimental autologous bone marrow transplant. She was then told that there was nothing else that could be done. Five weeks later, her disease was in total remission. Curiously, Frahm did not credit the biological effects of the bone marrow transplant with her recovery. Rather, she credited having adopted an extreme regimen of enemas (to \"detoxify\"), two weeks of juicing, eating raw fruits and vegetables, and avoiding sugar, meat, and dairy products. She got the idea that these dietary practices from searching the books that are most readily available in the marketplace. What Anne didn't realize is that most popular books about cancer are not reliable. The \"authorities\" Frahm names in her book, A Cancer Battle Plan, reads like a list of \"who's who\" in the world of cancer quackery. A religious person, Anne seemed confused about whether to give God or bizarre nutrition and self-treatment practices credit for her good fortune. She opted to claim that God works through these extreme lifestyle practices, His wonders to perform. She and her husband started HealthQuarters ministry located in Colorado Springs and began teaching others to practice extreme nutrition and self-care. Her Colorado Springs location exposed her to another source of misinformation, Ex-DDS Hal Huggins, and his local network of renegade health care providers. This appears to be significant in the final chapter of her life. Stories such as those of Anne's are very, very sad. We all are sympathetic to cancer patients whose lives are upset in their primes. Their focus shifts from family and career to battling the specter of an early death. However, those who have the audacity to declare that the nutrition scientists are wrong about how we should eat, and who gives so little credit to the medical scientists who are working so hard at understanding cancer prevention and treatment, assumes a heavy burden when they themselves fail to live out a full life. Just as the Anne Frahm's of the world want people to believe in their programs based upon their own personal survival, they should be willing to have their personal failures stand as equal evidence of their folly. Poor Anne died in February. The surviving true believers say that although the cancer had recurred, Anne actually died of a \"cavitation\"-a dental infection of the kind Hal Huggins and others are blaming on root canals (see \"Outmoded dental infection theory trying a comeback,\" NCAHF Newsletter, May-June, 1994). Anne was driven by fear and victimized by her ignorance. She was beguiled by the self-styled prophets of health who disdain the scientific approach to solving the mysteries of disease. Instead they turn to ideologies such as natural hygiene, vegetarianism, anti-establishmentarianism, and the confusion of mixing the idea \"God worked a miracle,\" with their own notions about how to \"cure yourself.\" HealthQuarters apparently plans to continue on its mission of promoting Anne's program. This calls to mind a seasoned observation about \"true believers\": Failures never daunt them. They can be rationalized. The technique was not properly applied. And, even when things turned out badly, they relieve themselves by believing that things would have undoubtedly been worse if they had not applied the technique. This is blind faith. Anne Frahm's case is a classic example of how good intentions combined with medical ignorance, and especially of the dynamics of self-deception via personal experience, can create an anathema for society. Frahm's misconceptions about how to deal with cancer demonstrate an essential principle of folk medicine: folk practitioners are \"experts\" in what \"everyone knows\" (actually, what everyone thinks is true which is a mixture of truth, half-truth, and errora) about health and disease. (See the article by Ames & Gold on cancer misconceptions described elsewhere in this issue.) There is little difference between the mind-set of practitioners and patients. On the other hand, the gap between medical knowledge and the patient is enormous. In fact, the gap between cancer specialists and general practitioners is also huge and can cause the latter to fall into quackery as well. What chance do the medically-ignorant have if even physicians can be fooled by personal experience coupled with wishful thinking? The wise know their limitations. BUSINESSES FILING UNFAIR COMPETITION SUITS AGAINST COMPETITORS WHO MAKE FALSE CLAIMS A Useful Antiquackery Tool The Upjohn Company sued the promoters of the Helsinki Hair Formula after Rogaine was approved by the FDA. It was not willing to share the hair restoration market with a pretender after it had spent millions of dollars proving its product. NCAHF has always liked the idea of legitimate businesses that are willing to take a stand for proven products by challenging competitors with unfair competition for making false claims. We have learned of more recent cases. Warner-Lambert Company versus Breath Asure Inc. The Warner-Lambert Company, makers of breath fresher products Listerine Antiseptic, Certs, Clorets, and Dentyne, have filed a lawsuit that alleges false advertising violations against Breath Asure, Inc., which sells Breath Asure. In this action Warner-Lambert seeks to stop Breath Asure's false claims that bad breath originates in the stomach, that Breath Asure can attack it there, that the effects will last for hours, and more (the suit names 10 specific false statements). Before leaving this story it is worthy of note that Warner-Lambert has had problems with the FTC for false claims, but the company has complied with corrective measures and tries to stay out of trouble. This being the case, it has even more reason to police the false claims of its competitors. (Civil Action No.98-1940, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, April 24, 1998) Power Bar Inc versus Power Balance Company. Power Bar Inc is charging rival Balance Bar Co with false advertising and unfair competition. Power Bar asserts that advertisements for Balance Bar falsely claim that the snacks \"Provide access to stored body fat\" and \"improve workout performance and recovery.\" In February, Balance Bar agreed to modify its advertising claims as recommended by the National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Better Business Bureau. The NAD said that Balance Bar lacked sufficient testing to substantiate claims that the zone diet, on which the bar is nutritionally based, is effective. The NAD action resulted from a complaint filed by Power Bar and Mars, Inc., maker of the VO2Max bar. Pfizer versus Viagra Counterfeits. Publicity on the approval of Pfizer Inc.'s Viagra, an anti-impotency drug that enables penile function by relaxing smooth muscle, has caused an increase in the promotion of many worthless products. Pfizer acted quickly against two substances being promoted on the Internet called Viagro and Vaegra charging copyright violations. Named in a Wall Street Journal article, \"Get ready for the Viagra wannabes,\" (April 30, 1998, p.B1+) were an herbal potion called NuMan (Interceuticals, Inc), Cobra Pills (Natural Balance, Inc), LLC's Stamina (HerbaSway Labs). Legitimate Businesses as Marketplace Watchdogs. Most interesting to NCAHF is the fact that one company is challenging the false claims of another on the basis of unfair competition. The assertions are that not only does such behavior deprive the legitimate company of immediate income by drawing away business, but by undermining consumer confidence in all such products long term income is also affected negatively. It would be good to see more companies take this approach. Imagine what would happen if the legitimate marketers of nonprescription medications would sue the herbal remedy promoters for unfair competition, diverting consumers from legitimate products, and undermining confidence in the over-the-counter medicine business. Why should one group of companies have to do expensive research and development and obtain FDA approval while others are allowed to make unsubstantiated claims? Imagine what would happen if a group of cancer treatment centers sued a clinic that was drawing cancer patients away by unsubstantiated claims of an effective cancer treatment program. This is a potential \"check and balance\" solution by marketplace forces aimed at a problem the government has had trouble solving because of accusations that it is Big Brother abusing business.

HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PRODUCT SALES STOPPED On March 10, 1992, a Wisconsin judge enjoined Vital Products, Ltd of Muskego, WI, and its president Conrad LeBeau, from promoting and selling hydrogen peroxide (H202) products for treating serious diseases such as AIDS and cancer. In 1989, FDA seized $1,300 worth of LeBeau's products which contained 35% and 17.5% H202. The products had been distributed along with a brochure, Hydrogen Peroxide Therapy: New Hope for Incurable Diseases that made many unsubstantiated claims (including that these products would lessen the effects of Downs syndrome!). The FDA had considered the brochure to be an extension of the label for the products. LeBeau asked FDA if he could sidestep labeling law requirements by having the products and brochure shipped from separate points. FDA denied this stating that as long as the products and promotional materials come together at some point it constitutes labeling. LeBeau refused to comply with FDA's request to desist, and continued his unlawful promotions (which included other Vital Health products White Birch Mineral Water, Licorice Root Tea, and Lymph System). The judge also ordered LeBeau to notify his customers that these products were illegal and can no longer be distributed. [FDA Consumer (Nov) 1992;26:(9):43-4] AIDS \"SECRET CURE\" SCAM Two Tennessee physicians, Therial Bynum (of Murfreesboro) and Everett Echols (of Shelbyville), lost their medical licenses after perpetrating a scheme in which AIDS patients were recruited by telling them that the doctors needed to document 100 cures before coming forth with their FDA approved drug program. It was claimed that the identity of the drugs had to remain a secret in order to keep others from stealing or misusing the program. Patients were told to stop using AZT because it could \"mask\" the effects of the secret remedy. The FDA was alerted when a patient became suspicious. The state's Board of Medical Examiners conducted an investigation which eventually led to prosecution and license revocation. [FDA Consumer, (Nov) 1992;26:(9):40-1.] Comment. Claiming to have a \"secret\" remedy is a fundamental tip-off to quackery. QUESTIONABLE WEIGHT LOSS PRODUCTS LISTED Obesity & Health [Nov-Dec, 1992] reports that despite stronger action against weight loss fraud in 1992 by federal regulatory agencies, a new crop of questionable products is thriving. Listed are 18 products, their claims and locations. Included are: Systematic and Permanent Weight Loss Method, Glandiet, Acu-stop 2000, Thermoslim, Fat Diets, Fat-Erasers, No More Diets, Ming Dynasty Patented Formulas, Body Shaper and Dr. James Method. Promoters of 8 of the 18 products are located in New York, 3 in Florida (with 2 more from Georgia by a Florida physician Roy Kupsinel, founder of the American Quack Association). Other promoter's locations were Utah, Connecticut, New Jersey and the Philippines. HATCH BILL PASSES Just as we feared, a bill prohibiting the FDA from responsible regulation of food supplements, herbal remedies and other such scams, passed as a rider on the appropriations bill on Oct.7. Sources told NCAHF that Sen. Hatch agreed not to oppose another amendment to the bill in exchange for passing his measure. A CBS news report stated that Hatch was motivated by \"the $700 million supplement industry within his state of Utah.\" Buccaneer entrepreneurialism has won a big one over consumer protection on this one. It is to be strictly \"buyer beware\" when it comes to purchasing dietary supplements. \"NUTRITIONISTS\" Laurie Tarkan does a superior job of warning the public about bogus nutritionists who prey upon the public's ignorance about diets and foods. The article gives a substantive overview of the types of practitioners involved, kinds of credentials, and what various states are doing in an attempt to regulate the problem. Included is information on laws regulating the use of specific titles (but not the practices), those that regulate practices per se (the best in our view), and voluntary licensing or registration. Tips on how to spot a quack are also provided. This is the best article we've seen on the topic. [Fitness, Oct. 1992] HERB BIBLE A HERESY Pharmacist Earl Mindell's Herb Bible (Simon & Schuster, 1992) has failed to impress a leading expert in the field of herbal medicines. Varro Tyler, PhD, is a professor of pharmacognosy at Purdue University, and an author of the standard textbook on the topic, Pharmacognosy (Lea & Febiger). Mindell states that he owes his lifelong interest in herbs to a college course, Pharmacognosy 101. Tyler states: \"as a professor in that discipline, I must say that it is unfortunate that he did not go on to Pharmacognosy 102.\" Tyler describes the Herb Bible as \"woefully inaccurate,\" and wonders why a major publisher is willing to put its imprint on such a book. He predicts that it will do well as a sales tool for health food stores, but \"fails miserably as a 'bible'.\" [Nutrition Forum, (Sept-Oct) 1992;9:40] CULTOLOGISTS SUE SOCIAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATIONS Two UC Berkeley professors who study cults have filed a RICO lawsuit against the American Psychological Association and the American Sociological Association alleging that several top executives attempted to destroy their careers. Drs. Margaret Singer and Richard Ofshe charge that from 1986 to the present the defendants resorted to improper influence of witnesses in state court litigations, filed untrue affidavits, attempted to obstruct justice in federal litigations, deceived federal judges, and committed wire and mail fraud. Plaintiffs say that these actions damaged their reputations as forensic experts in the fields of psychology and sociology in the area of coercive persuasion thus preventing their testimony against cults. Acts of collusion between several of the defendants and cult groups are specified. [The Cult Observer, 1992;9:(8):3-4] Comment: Although we do not have knowledge of the facts in the above case, we are aware of two generalizations about cult activities on higher education campuses. One is the presence of cultists within academia who work behind the scenes on behalf of their groups. The other concerns a failing within the intellectual climate pervading many university campuses characterized by an inability to make critical judgments about ideological propositions. This failing is based upon two false assumptions: (1) nothing can be known for certain; and (2) anything is possible; therefore, tolerance is the only virtue. These ideas are so close to the open-mindedness of science that some people cannot tell the difference. In fact, physical laws represent known principles, and help us understand the limits of what is possible (science involves not only the discovery of what is, but also what isn't so. Anti-science cults dub science as \"western\" and posited its methodology as \"only one way of discovering truth,\" with \"truth\" being entirely subjective and personal. Physical laws of science are denigrated as just a paradigm that will someday be refuted. The usual example cited is the displacement of Newtonian physics by Einstein's theory of relativity. It's error is the failure to realize that Newtonian physics, which still explain earthly phenomena, was not refuted but only revised to reflect the physics of outer space. Scientific tolerance is a virtue which is balanced by a responsibility to expose nonsense within a scientist's area of expertise, and to warn the public when such error are being promulgated. The on-campus popularity of anti-science cults may be a reaction to the failure of a kind of \"religion of science\" in which science is offered as the method for answering all questions. Science's self-imposed limits reduces its ability to fulfill emotional needs. The mind-control cults are most active within the academic community conducting self-serving \"research,\" publishing intellectually-appealing materials, and, in some cases, even buying financially-strapped colleges to provide a respectable base for their operations. We believe that the legal action taken by Singer and Ofshe to be highly significant and well worth watching. SCIENTISTS EXPRESS CONCERN ABOUT SUPPLEMENT ADS An analysis of nutritional supplement advertisements in 12 health and body-building magazines by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control led to the conclusions that physicians need to be concerned about supplement use and abuse. They say that unanticipated effects may occur with supplement use because many ingredients are not readily identifiable, and even for those which are identifiable, all potential effects of side effects may not be known. Also, supplement users may combine two or more products, and may set their own dosage regimens. Physicians and other health professionals are urged to routinely ask about supplement use when taking health histories. [JAMA, 1992;268:1008-11] CONSUMER DECEPTION IN VITAMIN ADVERTISING Flintstone vitamins tell kids that their product helps them grow big like the dinosaurs; Centrum Plus tells oldsters that its formulation incorporates the latest science on special needs of aging; General Nutrition Centers advertise that its biotin formulation will help prevent baldness. These messages are blatantly false or misleading, but where is the Federal Trade Commission? These may be examples of only \"soft core quackery\" (ie, it only costs money), but the impact has deeper meaning as health and nutrition misinformation become reinforced in the public's mind. With almost no regulation of dietary supplements for safety or effectiveness (see \"Hatch Bill Passes\") the long term effects could be serious for our democratic society. Democracy depends upon a well-informed electorate. Health policies which determine how we distribute our resources have been, and no doubt will continue to be, effected by the reinforcement of health misinformation in the public mind by slick advertising. CANCER CENTERS FILE LIBEL SUITS AGAINST MD CRITICS The Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA) of Tulsa, Oklahoma, a subsidiary of the American International Hospital of Zion, Illinois, has filed libel suits against four physicians quoted in a June 21, 1992, Dallas Morning News article that was critical of the program (see Sept-Oct, NCAHF Newsletter). Curiously, the newspaper was not named in the lawsuit, only individual physicians (Drs. Charles Moertel, Arnold Relman, Victor Herbert, and Roger Winn) who made critical comments. The suit alleges that the doctors' comments were malicious because they were made without having conducted first-hand investigations, visitations, clinical record reviews, and so forth. Comment. The CTCA action appears to be a SLAPP suit (Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation). Of grave concern is the effect this action may have upon the willingness of experts to speak to the media. Reporters often complain that doctors and scientists are too closed-mouthed as it is. Although SLAPP suits are generally dismissed, they can be costly and time consuming making it easier to remain silent. Those of us who have seen the effect of anti-trust suits on the willingness of medical organizations to speak out on consumer issues have good reason for concern. TOP TEN SUPPLEMENTS According to a health food industry report, 75 million Americans take a daily dietary supplement, and supplement sales account for 37% of all health food store sales (a whopping $1.4 billion). The top ten best sellers include 11 (two are tied for 5th), they are: The industry argues that these are safe because the National Poison Control Centers report few poisonings from supplements. The article also discusses the increasing market for herbal products and \"nutraceuticals.\" [Health Foods Business, 8/92] Comment. The facts are that there is so little oversight on the possible harmful effects of supplement abuse that even potential widespread dangers (such as the effects of iron on serum ferritin which may interact with other factors to cause serious diseases and premature death) go unassessed. The health food, herbal and supplement industries have acted as obstructionists to responsible regulation. In 1988 the industry tried to stop the reporting of adverse effects due to supplements. This year it lobbied hard for and achieved having dietary supplements exempted from meeting basic consumer protection standards of safety. If there is so little problem, why do these industries fear responsible oversight? THE POLITICAL DESTRUCTION OF RESPONSIBLE MEDICINE The political destruction of responsible medicine took a giant step forward in Alaska when Gov. Hickle appointed Robert Jay Rowen, MD, to the state medical board. This added to Alaska's systematic dismantling of consumer protection which included passing a so-called \"medical freedom\" law which only disciplines maverick doctors if their nonstandard methods cause harm to a patient (see \"Those misguided medical freedom laws,\" Sept-Oct, 1992, NCAHF Newsletter). Rowan practices chelation therapy for circulatory diseases, homeopathy, and blood cleansing. He is anti-fluoridation, anti-dental amalgam and anti-aluminum cookware. Rowan has treated Hickle and other state officials. He claims to have cured the Lt. Governor's wife of back pain by ordering the extraction of an endodontically-treated tooth allegedly linked to her problem through \"acupuncture circuits.\" The Alaska State Medical Association wrote to Hickle opining that Rowan has strayed so far from the diagnostic and therapeutic measures taught in medical schools that he no longer practices medicine, and that he should not sit on a board with authority over real MDs. At least one medical board member has resigned refusing to be associated with the board if the likes of Rowan are to be a part of it. Medical mavericks are delighted with this turn of events and refer to Alaska as \"the medical freedom\" state Note: Alaska was also the first state to legalize the quack cancer remedy laetrile. It was a meaningless law because in order to circumvent the federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act no part of laetrile could cross state lines. Apricot pits don't grow in Alaska, nor was there a licensed drug-maker to produce the product there. The only value of the law was for propaganda use by laetrile promoters. Twenty-six states eventually passed similar laws with no subsequent benefit to cancer patients. The Rowan affair is detailed in the American Medical News, 10/2/92. TEACHING HOW TO CHEAT INSURANCE COMPANIES Staff writer Ames Alexander [Asbury Park Press (NJ) 10/6/92] details the methods of several chiropractic practice consulting firms which teach what appears to be thinly disguised lessons in insurance fraud. Alexander presents detailed facts which makes it apparent that health fraud and abuse are hard nuts to crack. Much of what is done is not actually illegal. Practice-building firms discussed in his report include Peter Fernandez (Practice Management Associates), Reggie Gold, Ron Halstead, Larry Markson, Terry Rondberg (Vertebral Subluxation Research Institute), and David Singer (the Scientology-linked firm). Representatives of NCAHF and the National Association for Chiropractic Medicine are widely quoted in this insightful article. The piece is one of a four-part series on health care fraud. EUTHANASIA VERSUS MEDICAL NEGLECT OF CHILDREN Scott Sokol, MD, raises a poignant question in the CHILD Newsletter ((1992, #2) when he asks how legislators can on one hand exempt Christian Scientists who let their children die from treatable disorders from prosecution for manslaughter, but charge people with murder who engage in mercy-killing. Both involve the law's response to the loss of life due to the actions of loved ones. We add that this is particularly puzzling when one considers that most of the objects of euthanasia are older adults whose lives are behind them while children lose most of their lifetimes. The answer to Dr. Sokol's question is probably that people wanting mercy-killing aren't well-organized as is Christian Science. The CS church has made a point out of securing special treatment for itself, even in the face of the Constitution which forbids Congress from recognizing the establishment of any religion. Dr. Sokol's question is one that ought to make legislators of conscience think. THE AMISH: VULNERABILITY OF THE \"GENTLE PEOPLE\" TO QUACKERY Despite the fact that the Amish are a people living apart from the 20th Century, modern quackery has managed to find them! As a scholar interested in the behavioral psycho-social dynamics of quackery due to case reports of Amish people who have been victimized, I have long sought reliable information on the Amish. John A. Hostetler provides insight into Amish health practices and their vulnerability in his book Amish Society (Johns Hopkins Press, 1980) He says: During recent years the Amish have been disproportionately influenced by articulate \"back to nature\" movements, special health-food interests, and vitamin and food-supplement industries that seek to sell their literature, ideologies, and products. The Amish lack of familiarity with good medical practices has made them vulnerable to such influences. (p.318) Although there is nothing in the Amish's religion that precludes standard medical care, members often forego vaccination (only 26% had been vaccinated for polio in 1978), and often prefer chiropractors to MDs because they talk to them on a simpler level and lay on hands as part of treatment. Amish folk healers sometimes mimic chiropractic treatment in their practices. Another factor in Amish's vulnerability to quackery is found in their magical traditions that they brought with them from Europe. Magical beliefs and the metaphysical aspects of vitalism are inseparable. Vitalism is: \"the doctrine that the functions of a living organism are due to a vital principle distinct from physicochemical forces.\" Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary; or as Dorland's Medical Dictionary puts it: \"the theory that biological activities are directed by a supernatural force; opposed to mechanism.\" Vitalism underlies nearly every pseudomedical system of health care although it goes by different names among the various nonscientific credited as the originator of scientific medicine because of his teaching that disease and healing resulted from natural, not supernatural (ie, the gods), forces. He named the natural healing force Vis Medicatrix Naturae. Naturopaths misrepresent Hippocrates' vital healing force when they present it in metaphysical terms.| [Hide Full Content](#twenty-nine-thousand-eight-hundred-eight) PDF 20, Issue #4 CATTLEMAN SUES OPRAH FOR MAD COW DISEASE SCARE According to NBC Nightly News (6/5/97), a Texas rancher is suing Oprah Winfrey for making false claims about how beef cattle are fed in the USA. Oprah was said to have shown a film on Mad Cow Disease and to have declared that she would think a long time before eating another burger. The rancher had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars that day on the stock market.

Volume 20, Issue #4 CATTLEMAN SUES OPRAH FOR MAD COW DISEASE SCARE According to NBC Nightly News (6/5/97), a Texas rancher is suing Oprah Winfrey for making false claims about how beef cattle are fed in the USA. Oprah was said to have shown a film on Mad Cow Disease and to have declared that she would think a long time before eating another burger. The rancher had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars that day on the stock market. The lawsuit is based on a law against making false statements regarding perishable foods that came about because of the Alar fiasco a few years back. Apparently, 11 states now have such laws. \"Mad Cow Disease\" (Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE) is theorized to have resulted from feeding cattle an offal mixture that contained the remains of sheep which suffered from scrapie, a spongiform encephalopathy. News about BSE in UK cattle caused a media sensation, and destroyed the UK beef export business. The US Dept of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) says that there has never been a case of BSE in the USA, and just a single case in Canada in a cow imported from Great Britain (the cow, her herdmates, and other nearby cattle were destroyed). In contrast, over 163,000 cattle have been diagnosed with BSE in the UK. BSE is a slowly progressive degenerative disease affecting the central nervous system of cattle. It was first diagnosed in Great Britain in 1986. In 1990, the British government established the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) to study the problem. On March 20, 1996, the SEAC advised the government that it had become concerned about 10 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) identified through national surveillance. CJD occurs at a rate of 1-2/million worldwide. US incidence is 1/million. The SEAC concluded that there was no direct scientific evidence linking BSE and CJD, but in the absence of any credible alternative explanation, they were guessing that the cases may be linked to exposure before 1989. No beef has been imported from the UK to the USA since 1985. From 1981-89, 455 cattle were imported from the UK. All have been traced, are examined regularly, and some have been purchased by APHIS for research. Thus far, no BSE has been detected in the USA. Comment: The Mad Cow Disease story would be a non-story in the USA if it were not for the propaganda efforts of vegetarian groups. EarthSave, PETA, PCRM, and the Seventh-day Adventist website have seized upon the opportunity to frighten people into behaving in ways they find ideologically delightful. During the same period of time that speculation has been running wild about the possible association between eating beef and BSE, there have been reports of sickness and death from eating strawberries and raspberries from central America contaminated by irrigation with untreated drain-water containing hepatitis virus. No mention of these problems is made by the vegetarians. The reality is that any type of food can become unhealthful via contamination. It is curious that meat-eaters do not try to frighten people away from fruits and vegetables (they could exaggerate the dangers of pesticide residues, etc.), but ideological vegetarians never pass up a chance to attack animal products. [For information on BSE, contact APHIS at 4700 River Road, Unit 51, Riverdale, MD 20737-1232; 301-734-7799; Fax: 734-5205.] PLACEBO HELPS PROSTATE PROBLEMS LONGTERM A study done in Canada found a remarkable placebo effect. Researchers followed 613 patients who were either given the Merck & Co. drug finasteride or a placebo (white flour in a capsule) for two years. The subjects were tested by measuring the sizes of their prostate glands and by having them urinate into a metered device that determined the rate and volume of flow. The finesteride patients experienced a 21% decrease in prostate-size, while the placebo group experienced an 8.4% increase in prostate-size. Nevertheless, a significant number of the 303 men in the placebo group felt much better, and demonstrated improved urinary flow-even though their prostates grew in size! The urologist who headed the study is now willing to prescribe placebo therapy for benign prostatic hypertrophy rather than to fully discourage medication and do watchful waiting. The only problem is that the placebo he has in mind is herbal therapy-most likely, saw palmetto. NCAHF president William Jarvis told the Associated Press that he doesn't think it wise for doctors to prescribe herbal product placebos because it would instill consumer confidence in the products of an industry that has failed to demonstrate that it can be trusted by consumers. The herbal industry has not yet even developed manufacturing standards that assure consumers that they are getting what they pay for. Even worse, there is no effective system for tracking unanticipated adverse effects from herbal products. Physicians should not reward an industry that is strongly at odds with responsible behavior in connection with health maintenance. The study described above was reported during the week of April 18, 1997 at a meeting of the American Urological Association at New Orleans. It will be published in an upcoming issue of the association's journal. [Houston Chronicle, April 18, 1997, p.20A] Comment: This study seems to show that there is an important psychological component to the urinary performance of men with prostate problems. This increases the likelihood that a quack remedy can generate a substantial number of satisfied customers who will attest to the remedy's value when, in fact, their disease is worsening. Placebos are not harmless if they mislead patients about the progress of a serious disease. A USEFUL CONSUMER'S BOOK FOR DENTAL PATIENTS Dentists Marvin J. Schissel and John E. Dodes have composed The Whole Tooth, a book to guide consumers in their quest for quality dental care. Part one describes problems plaguing dentistry as a profession. These are many of the same problems eroding the whole concept of professionalism in modern society. Part two explains dental care for the dental consumer. It is very helpful to anyone who wants to know about the various dental procedures and when they are appropriate. Part three covers quackery in general and dental quackery in particular. Part four deals with insurance and managed care. Part five concludes with recommendations for the ideal practice of dentistry. This is a splendid book that should be part of every consumer health education library. The 1997 book is published by St. Martin's Press, 175 Fifth Avenue, NY, NY 10010-7848;212-674-5151; fax: 212-420-9314; price: $23.95, $31.99 Canada. An article by the authors summarizing some of the problems covered by the book entitled, \"Is it time to look for another dentist?\" appeared in the current issue of Priorities (1997, #2). Drs. Dodes and Schissel are president and vice-president respectively of the New York Chapter of NCAHF. MAIL ORDER IQ TESTS STOPPED The Board of Psychology, which is part of the Medical Board of California's Division of Medical Quality has obtained an agreement from Mr. Kevin Langdon to cease the unlicensed devising, distributing, and scoring IQ tests in California. According to a complainant, Mr. Langdon's principal objective in carrying on this illegal program was to inflate the IQs of his testees. This was done to qualify them for enrollment in \"high IQ societies\" which he controlled and from which he derived prestige and dues income. The California board was completely unaware of Langdon's IQ tests even thought one of them, the LAIT, had been published in Omni magazine in April, 1979. Langdon is said to have carried on his operation for two decades during which he tested approximately 30,000 individuals, including about 4,000 Californians. ALT-MED DOC EXPRESSES CONCERNS ABOUT BLUE-GREEN ALGAE TOXICITY John McPartland, DO, is director of the Vermont Alternative Medicine clinic in Middleburg, but he hasn't let his fondness for unusual medicine prevent him from seeing the down-side of blue-green algae. In an article entitled, \"Why blue-green algae makes me tired,\" (Townsend Letter, 6/97) McPartland says that he is tired of people trying to sell him blue-green algae, and provides an exceptional critique of Cell Tech, the main huckster of the substance. The article is a reprint of one published earlier in the Vermont Alternative Medicine Newsletter, which gave Cell Tech a chance to complain and McPartland the opportunity to respond in an epilogue. This is an excellent article for blue-green algae watchers. COMMERCIALISM VERSUS PROFESSIONALISM William Jarvis, PhD John McArthur, DBA, of the Harvard Business School and Francis Moore, MD, of the Harvard Medical School point out that: There are two contrasting streams, two distinct cultural traditions, for providing services in the United States: the commercial and the professional. While these two traditions stand in sharp contrast to each other, they have shared a central role in the evolution of our society and its institutions. It is our purpose here to explore threats to the quality and scope of medical care that arise when the tradition of medical professionalism is overtaken (emphasis added) by the commercial ethic and by corporations seeking profit for investors from the clinical care of the sick [1]. The differences between the cultures of commerce and professionalism is at the heart of the problems disrupting managed care today; and, as shall be shown below, involve the same principles that divide quackery and standard medicine. An editorial in the same issue of JAMA makes our point: The American Medical Association (AMA) [was] formed in 1847 for the purpose of setting up a code of ethics and distinguishing between physicians and quacks. Professional medical goals can be protected only if they are well understood [2]. The Culture of Professionalism Professionalism is rooted in principles established by Hippocrates, the \"father of medical science.\" Hippocrates coined the term \"physician\" from physikos, Greek for \"nature,\" to denote that health and disease are natural, not supernatural, processes. The notion that healers possess supernatural powers (eg, faith healing, Therapeutic Touch, animal magnetism) lingers in the minds of many people, and is also seen in the messianic charisma of egomaniacal quacks. Hippocrates told physicians to stop taking credit for their cures, the body has its own inherent healing capabilities; therefore, post hoc ergo propter hoc (\"after it, therefore, because of it\") was faulty logic. The best that can be done is to aid these, and the worst that can be done is to impede these self-healing processes-primum non nocere, \"above all, do no harm.\" Further, because of the body's inherent healing ability, a physician could not know whether a remedy or nature brought about a cure; therefore, physicians could only learn what remedies do not work when a patient did not recover. The idea of learning mainly from failures also underlies the reality that science is better at finding what does not work than it is at making medical breakthroughs. Hippocrates urged physicians to seek out new remedies, but to be skeptical, ie, from Greek, skeptomai, \"look at something carefully,\" \"examine,\" and \"consider\" it [3]. Hippocrates taught humility, cooperation among physicians, social responsibility, and above all the commitment to the patient. McArthur and Moore point out: The fundamental act of professional medical care is the assumption of responsibility for the patient's welfare-an unwritten contract ... acknowledged by the physician that \"we will take care of you.\" The essential image of the professional is that of a practitioner who values the patient's welfare above his or her own and provides service even at a fiscal loss and despite discomfort or inconvenience [1]. McArthur and Moore also note: When a corporation employing physicians seeks profit by selling their services, the physician-employees cease to act as free agents. Professional commitment to patient care is subordinated to new rules of practice that assure the profitability of the corporation [1]. The Culture of Commercialism The commercial culture is rooted in the principles of Adam Smith, the \"father of modern economics.\" Smith is the hero to free market ideologists such as Milton Friedman, whose book Free To Choose strongly influenced Ronald Reagan (Friedman advocates abolishing the FDA). Adam Smith held that the wealth of nations would mount with each worker-including the quack-doing what he did best. Sociologist Herbert Spencer taught that government should not suppress quackery on the basis of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Evolutionary progress meant that the fit should survive and prosper, whereas the unfit should perish. Society, like nature, was red in tooth and claw. Government action protecting those so unfit as to succumb to quackery only impeded society's progress [4]. The culture of commercialism celebrates the profit motive, the law of supply and demand, competition, advertising, and so forth. Free market ideologists advocate laissez faire, with its inherent doctrine of caveat emptor, \"let the buyer beware.\" Caveat Emptor / Caveat Vendor Caveat emptor is based upon the equality of bargaining positions of buyer and seller. In medieval times this was practical because people bargained for common products with friends and neighbors. As trade expanded, buyers were forced to trust the word of strangers that items were what they were represented to be. During the 15th century the concept of caveat vendor (\"let the seller beware\") became the rule for marketplace situations in which buyers and sellers were on unequal terms [5]. The judge charged the jury in a case involving the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act saying: This law was not passed to protect experts, especially not to protect scientific men who know the value and meaning of drugs, but for the protection of ordinary citizens [6]. Justice Frankfurter also restated the fundamental principle of caveat vendor in a case interpreting the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: The purposes of this legislation...touch phases of the lives and health of people which, in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection [6] Accountability Professionalism supports the accountability inherent in the principle of caveat vendor. Standard medicine cooperates with the FDA regarding medicines and medical devices, and conducts peer reviews of other procedures. Peers possess equal knowledge and help judge the worth of medical procedures. The FDA Center for Drug Safety has reported that 80% of reports on adverse reactions to drugs come from pharmaceutical companies themselves while virtually none are reported by the dietary supplement industry [7]. Commercial interests can escape accountability by providing label warnings. Such fulfills the \"duty to warn.\" The freedom allowed commercialism to confuse the issues in our society is exemplified by the tobacco industry. The industry uses free speech to misinform the public on the health effects of its products, while at the same time escaping accountability by placing warning labels on packaging and in advertising. Books promoting questionable health-care practices do the same. A set of publications vigorously promoting \"alternative\" medicine is the Alternative Medicine Yellow Pages and Alternative Medicine; The Definitive Guidepublished by Burton Goldberg, a Florida land developer who believes that his girl friend's 19-year-old daughter was saved by unorthodox medicine. Goldberg alleges that the girl suffered from mental illness \"caused by hypoglycemia, an imbalance created by food allergies, problems in her pancreas, and an overgrowth of bad bacteria in her gastrointestinal tract.\" [8] These are dubious diagnoses, but he believes. Although the book cover declares that it contains \"everything you must know about effective therapies\" (emphasis added), inside a carefully-crafted disclaimer that appears several times throughout the book hedges on the claim that therapies are effective by declaring that by definition, \"alternative\" methods \"include those that have not been investigated or approved by any government or regulatory agency,\" and that \"ultimately, you, the reader, must take full responsibility for your health and how you use this book.\" The idea that consumers must \"read the fine print\" to find the disclaimers reflects the traditional duplicity of caveat emptor. Incompatibility of Professionalism and Commercialism. The hopeful idea for commercializing health care administration was that marketplace forces would stimulate inventiveness and marketplace efficiency. Unfortunately, the social planners did not fully understand the contrasting cultures they were trying to marry. And herein lies the common thread tying the problem of quackery to those perplexing problems within managed health care. Little wonder that it has been so easy for some marketing-minded HMOs to integrate \"alternative\" medicine into their programs. McArthur and Moore describe the heart of the problem: The fundamental objective of commerce in providing medical care is achieving an excess of revenue over costs while caring for the sick, ensuring profit for corporate providers, investors, or insurers. A central feature in enhancing net of income over expense in a competitive market is a reduction in volume or quality of services so as to reduce costs, while maintaining prices to the purchaser. In this setting, the operation of market forces is hampered because patients and families can rarely acquire the information necessary to discriminate as to suitability and quality among alternative clinical services and providers. Without consumer input, market forces often fail completely, or behave perversely... In purchasing commercial services, the public has learned to beware both of low quality and excessive pricing, as expressed in the Latin phrase caveat emptor-\"let the buyer beware.\" The American public is gradually becoming aware that caveat emptor may soon become caveat morbidus-\"let the patient beware.\" [1] Competition among Professionals Inherent in marketplace competition is advancing oneself as superior to others in the same business. Jameson states that \"it is the principle of self-advertisement that really defines quackery.\" [9] Superiority claims automatically turns colleagues into competitors. Health professionals have traditionally worked together against humanity's common enemies of disease and death. The Sherman Antitrust Act exempts cooperative scientific endeavors from the rules governing the business community (conspiracy, restraint of trade). In the world of commerce, companies jealously protect trade secrets, and \"corporate espionage\" is a lucrative form of economic treason; scientists work in the open and readily share information. Describing protocols in terms so clear that it enables others to reproduce their work facilitates the gold standard of science-replication. Prohibiting secret remedies was the cornerstone of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act; and, one of the defining characteristics of quackery is claiming to have \"a secret remedy.\" Will It Sell vs Should It Be Sold? The world of commerce is driven by supply and demand. By contrast, in the world of professionalism, procedures found to be ineffective are discarded even though they would still attract consumers. Regarding standard health products, from 1990 to 1992, the FDA banned, or proposed to ban, 749 ineffective ingredients used in nonprescription drugs and weight loss products grandfathered by the 1962 Harris-Kefauver Amendment [10]. There is no indication that the companies that sold these ineffective drugs would have discontinued marketing them just because they didn't work. The poorly regulated nonprescription medicine marketplace is now filled with unproven homeopathic remedies and dietary supplements. Standard health services are also subjected to testing. In the 1950s internal mammary ligation was widely used to relieve angina pectoris. Patients reported increased working capacity and less chest pain. Nevertheless, a test was done. It found that patients who received only an incision did just as well as those who got the surgery [11]. As a result, surgeons stopped using the technique, not because there ceased to be a marketplace demand, nor because patients were dissatisfied, but because it simply did not work. The discontinued mammary ligation procedure can be compared to the present-day marketing of chelation therapy for heart disease. Patient demand is high because they wish to avoid bypass surgery, and subjective reports of improvement mirror those given for internal mammary ligation. There is strong evidence that the procedure is worthless. However, maverick doctors have banded together to lobby for commercial standards. Their patients sometimes carry placards demanding that chelationists be excused from regulatory control. \"Medical Freedom Laws\" The rules of commercialism are gradually displacing professionalism. At least 8 states have passed laws that prevent licensing boards from disciplining members for unprofessional conduct for substituting \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" methods for standard care. This effectively does away with the peer review process of professionalism, and puts patients on their own for spotting inappropriate medicine. Senator Orrin Hatch, a chelation therapy user himself, weakened the health fraud section of the Kennedy-Kasselbaum Act by adding an amendment that provides some cover for nonstandard practitioners. Congress has been working on what is known as the Access to Medical Treatment Act, that will open the public purse to nonstandard \"alternative\" health care. Safety and Efficacy By Semantics vs Proof Professionalism's rule of primum non nocere is supplanted by semantics. Homeopathy is touted as \"the natural way to promote recovery and restore health,\" [12 ] but offers no sound evidence that it is either safe or effective. Chiropractic and naturopathy claim to be \"natural and drug free\" ways to health, but lack proof of safety and efficacy. Traditional healing systems such as ayurvedic and Chinese Medicine claim that having existed for thousands of years validates them, but offer little that will pass for scientific evidence. \"Alternative-complementary\" medicine providers talk the talk, but clamor to have the standards of science set aside so they can qualify. Those who understand the duplicity of commercialism know that it is important to listen carefully to words, and to understand their meanings. An expert in the deceptive language used in advertising warns that: Weasel word(s) can make you hear things that are not being said, accept as truths things that have only been implied, and believe things that have only been suggested. When you hear a weasel word, you automatically hear the implication. Not the real meaning, but the meaning it wants you to hear [13]. Patient Satisfaction vs Clinical Effectiveness Clinical effectiveness is established when a procedure performs better than \"no treatment\" and/or \"placebo therapy.\" Placebo therapy can, by definition (literally \"I shall please\"), satisfy patients [14]. Questionable remedies also can claim subjectively reported \"successes.\" Reported \"success\" with \"alternative\" arthritis remedies was from 8 to 56%. [15] The percentages of cancer patients reporting satisfaction with \"unorthodox\" treatment were only slightly lower than their satisfaction with standard care [16]. Patients of chiropractors were three times as likely as patients of family physicians to report that they were \"very satisfied\" with the care they received for low back pain, much more likely to have been satisfied with the amount of information they were given, to have perceived that their provider was concerned about them, and to have felt that their provider was comfortable and confident dealing with their problem [17], but there is no evidence that chiropractic care is more effective for low back pain [18]. Customer satisfaction is not incompatible with sound medicine, but the art of care should enhance, not supplant, the science of care.

The agency received at least 44 adverse event reports in the past 10 years, according to the Sept. 28 safety notification, in which anti-theft systems (also called electronic article surveillance systems) and metal detectors appeared to interfere with implantable pacemakers, implantable cardioverter/ defibrillators, and spinal cord stimulators. FDA believes that other electronic medical devices may also be affected. Reported effects of interference have included chest pain in pacemaker users, unintended shocks to patients with implantable cardioverter/ defibrillators, and pain and jolts-and in one case a fall that resulted in injury-due to overstimulation from spinal cord stimulators. Also reported were shifts in pacemakers' pulsing rates and unwanted changes of implantable cardioverter/ defibrillators to \"monitor only\" mode. In the letter, FDA recommended that doctors tell their patients about some precautions they can take: Know that in many commercial establishments, anti-theft systems may be hidden or camouflaged in entrances and exits so they are not readily visible. Do not stay near the anti-theft system or metal detector longer than necessary and do not lean against the system. When being scanned with a hand-held metal detector, warn security personnel that you have an electronic medical device and ask them not to hold the metal detector near the device any longer than is absolutely necessary; or ask for another form of personal search. FDA asks health-care practitioners to report any adverse events related to electromagnetic interference with electronic devices to FDA's MedWatch program. The entire safety notification letter can be found on FDA's Website: fda.gov/cdrh/safety.4html. Serious Product Problem? Report It Health professionals can report serious adverse reactions or other product problems to the product's manufacturer or directly to FDA's MedWatch program. A MedWatch report can be made by using the 800 number or visit the Website for forms or for further assistance. FDA encourages consumers to report through their doctors, but if they prefer, they may submit the MedWatch form themselves. Comment: Many quack diagnostic and treatment devices are electronic or pseudo-electronic. Some are legally manufactured but then modified and can be dangerous. One such case was prosecuted in Washington County, Iowa. Does anyone know if the following problems have been encountered with non FDA approved devices? POSSIBLE LINK FOUND BETWEEN SUPPLEMENTS AND SERIOUS ILLNESS Confirming Mayo Clinic research, FDA has identified impurities in certain dietary supplements that might be related to the illness eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS). The supplements, some 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5HTP) products, are being used for insomnia, depression, obesity, and, in children, attention deficit disorder. While the significance of FDA's finding remains unknown, the agency believes vigilance towards these products is warranted. FDA is unaware of any recent illnesses associated with 5HTP products being sold as dietary supplements; however, the widespread promotion and use of these products began only recently. In 1991, an impurity associated with 5HTP, called Peak X, was identified in one case of EMS. Impurities similar to Peak X also were found in L-tryptophan that was associated with a 1989 epidemic of EMS. Also, the medical literature includes reports of 10 previous EMS cases worldwide associated with 5HTP products. The exact cause of the 1989 and 1991 cases of EMS remains unclear. EMS is a serious illness characterized by a rise in certain white blood cells and severe muscle pain. The national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified more than 1,500 cases of EMS, including 38 deaths, associated with L-tryptophan. FDA is working with CDC and the National Institutes of Health to monitor use of 5HTP products and is consulting with professional and patient groups. The agency encourages the public to report serious adverse reactions to the agency's MedWatch program. To report adverse reactions, professionals and consumers can call 1-800-FDA-1088 (1-800-332-1088). Doctors and other health-care professionals also may send the information by fax to 800-FDA-0178 (800-332-0178) or by mail using postage paid form to HF-2, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787. Comment: FDA's legal definition of supplements now includes many substances. This definition includes vitamins; minerals; herbs, botanicals, and other plant-derived substances; and amino acids (the individual building blocks of protein) and concentrates, metabolites, constituents and extracts of these substances. PHONY DOC SENTENCED TO REAL JAIL TIME A man who posed as a doctor and claimed to have hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide was put out of business after FDA officials discovered the impostor had been diagnosing and treating nonexistent conditions and purchasing and selling unapproved drugs since 1989. Edwin E. Kokes, owner of Independent Testing Labs of Grand Island, Neb., was sentenced Aug. 19, 1998, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska to two and a half years in prison and three years of supervised release for sending unapproved drugs and diagnostic analyses through the mail. He also was fined $5,000 and ordered to pay $80,000 in restitution to his victims. According to the case agent in FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations, the 63-year-old Kokes generated nearly $1 million in seven years by claiming that he could diagnose and treat such medical conditions as AIDS, cancer and allergies from hair and fingernail samples. He boasted of his \"technologically advanced laboratory,\" in which he analyzed hair and fingernail samples with what he termed a \"laser\" received from a friend at NASA and other hand-held devices, such as an electron microscope. He also told potential patients that the products he sold and various treatments he conducted in his office could cure their diseases, often offering them at inflated prices. Questions surrounding Kokes' wrongdoings first surfaced during a 1993 FDA Minneapolis district office investigation of another self-proclaimed but uncredentialed physician, Karl Brunkow. Following complaints received about Brunkow's practice, FDA investigators posing as patients learned that Brunkow sent samples of his patients' hair to Independent Testing Labs, Inc, in Nebraska, and that he treated his patients based on hair analyses conducted by the laboratory's owner, Edwin Kokes. During the investigation, an FDA investigator submitted several hair samples and one fingernail sample from himself and one other person to Kokes' laboratory. From these samples, each of which cost between $25 and $50, Kokes not only identified allergies, toxic blood levels, and problems with glands, reproductive organs, and the liver and kidneys, but he did so for three different people. He then prescribed his products-Zymex, Immuplex and M-Bone-all drugs that FDA has not approved. FDA's Forensic Chemistry Center in Cincinnati analyzed the M-Bone product and found it to be diluted sulfuric acid, a strong irritant, which Kokes was selling for up to $300 per 4-ounce container. Records reviewed later in the investigation revealed that one of Kokes' patients had complained to him that her skin was burned after he advised her to apply the M-Bone topically. At one stage of the investigation, FDA investigators submitted guinea pig hair to Kokes, and from that analysis, he diagnosed human diseases. FDA could find no evidence that Kokes was a licensed physician, chiropractor or osteopath, even though he always referred to himself as a doctor and signed his name \"Edwin E. Kokes, UMM [ultramolecular medicine], Ph.D,\" according to case documentation. Other titles he assumed included \"Dr.\" and \"CRA,\" which stands for contact reflex analysis. Kokes also claimed to have been a surgeon during the Korean War. FDA's case agent, who did not have ovarian cancer but told Kokes that she did, met with him undercover after he falsely confirmed her diagnosis from a hair sample she had sent him to analyze. He told her he had cured 400 to 500 AIDS patients and 97 percent of the 3,000 to 4,000 ovarian cancer patients he had treated with his products. In addition, he told her he often advised individuals with real, known diseases, such as cancer, not to seek traditional medical treatment or continue legitimate medicines prescribed by their doctors. He claimed that traditional treatments could cause the cancer to worsen or even cause death. The agent said Kokes also went on record as saying that he advised his patients not to tell their medical doctors about his treatment plans and convinced some of his patients to sign a waiver to keep office visits and conversations with Kokes from being disclosed to investigators. During sentencing, defense attorneys argued that Kokes should not be sent to prison because he suffered from delusions and personality disorders and had no grasp of reality. However, a psychiatrist for the prosecution stated that Kokes did not appear to be delusional or psychotic but instead tended to make exaggerated statements. He said the fact that Kokes decided to legitimately register his business as a corporation with the state of Nebraska showed he was thinking rationally. Kokes pleaded innocent in June 1996 to 11 counts of mail fraud and one count of using a fictitious name or title, but he reversed his plea in September 1997 as part of a plea agreement that allowed all but one count of mail fraud to be dropped. Kokes received the maximum penalty allowed under the plea agreement. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Minneapolis declined to prosecute Kokes' accomplice, Karl Brunkow, now deceased, because of his age\u201492\u2014at the time of the investigation. \u2014Carol Lewis Comment: The various definitions of quackery can really be used on this case. \"A psychiatrist for the prosecution stated that Kokes did not appear to be delusional or psychotic but instead tended to make exaggerated statements.\" RECORD FINE FOR PRODUCT TAINTED WITH E. COLI A California juice company was fined $1.5 million after pleading guilty to 16 misdemeanor criminal charges related to a 1996 outbreak of dangerous Escherichia coli O157:H7 bacteria. One child died and 14 other children were seriously sickened after drinking the company's fresh, unpasteurized apple juice. The fine is one of the largest ever imposed in FDA history for a food injury case, and the criminal conviction by federal prosecutors is one of the first ever obtained in a large-scale outbreak of infectious pathogens. Odwalla Inc., of Half Moon Bay, agreed in a criminal plea bargain in July to pay the fine and serve five years of court-supervised probation. The plea agreement, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, also requires Odwalla to implement a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan in its facility. HACCP is a food safety system that identifies potential food safety hazards and specifies controls for preventing these hazards. A $250,000 portion of the fine will be divided between a charitable organization, Safe Tables Our Priority (STOP), and the food safety research centers of the University of Maryland and Pennsylvania State University. The funds will be used to raise consumer food safety awareness and research the safety of fresh produce. The tainted juice affected consumers in Colorado, California, Washington state, and British Columbia. Fifteen children who drank the juice developed the life-threatening condition hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a leading cause of kidney failure in children. One of the children, a 16-month-old Colorado girl, died from HUS-related multiple organ failure. At least 51 others were sickened, but to a lesser degree. Food safety experts say survivors of this strain of E. coli may have significant health problems for years. In late October 1996, FDA received word that the health departments from the three affected states had identified an E. coli O157:H7 outbreak. Washington state health officials also told FDA that using DNA \"fingerprinting\" methods, they had clustered 15 related cases of E. coli infection in which all the victims had reported drinking Odwalla apple juice. When notified of these findings, Odwalla began a recall Oct. 31 of all its apple juice products. At the same time, FDA launched a 14-month investigation. An investigator with FDA's San Francisco district office, Helen Hamaoka, inspected the Odwalla plant and collected apple juice samples, which were shipped to FDA's analytical laboratory in Seattle. Tests showed the samples were negative for E. coli O157:H7. Hamaoka noted, however, that the company had ignored safety standards by centering its product testing more on shelf life than bacterial contamination. On Nov 5, 1996, FDA's Seattle district laboratory analyzed samples of juice found in an Odwalla warehouse in Washington state. One sample that came from juice processed around Oct. 7, 1996, tested positive for E. coli O157:H7. The laboratory analysis enabled FDA to link the E. coli outbreak positively to Odwalla juice. As part of its criminal investigation of Odwalla, FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations began interviewing former Odwalla employees, suppliers, and others familiar with company operations. Their comments indicated that Odwalla had in the past had numerous deficiencies in its sanitation procedures. For example, accepted industry practice calls for use of a chlorine solution for washing and sanitizing fruit, but Odwalla had stopped using chlorine and was instead using phosphoric acid, which may not be effective as a fruit wash. OCI also learned that the U.S. Army had rejected a contract with Odwalla in June 1996 after Army analysis identified a high bacterial count in an Odwalla product. OCI also discovered that a consultant hired by the company had uncovered Listeria and other bacterial contamination in the processing plant during weekly microbiological tests he conducted between May 1994 and December 1995. OCI learned that Odwalla initially tried to identify and eliminate the source of the Listeria contamination but ultimately focused on extending shelf life without ever conclusively solving the contamination problem. Records showed that Odwalla had used an inferior grade of apples, which may have made the juice more prone to contamination. After determining that Odwalla's operations created an environment within which E. coli O157:H7 could exist, OCI's investigation centered on determining the source of the contamination. Though officials could not pinpoint the exact source, several theories emerged. Among them: The apples used to make the juice were contaminated with animal fecal material. The wooden crates used to ship the apples were contaminated. Odwalla employees failed to wash their hands properly after using the bathroom and before returning to production areas. As part of the consent decree, Odwalla implemented a HACCP plan whose provisions include: maintaining sanitary conditions to avoid food contamination, a written sanitation control program run by a qualified manager, a comprehensive employee training program in areas such as proper food handling and personal hygiene. In June 1997, Hamaoka inspected Odwalla again and took juice samples and swabs from the company's equipment for analysis. The samples proved negative for E. coli, and Hamaoka noted that the company had begun using more effective sanitation methods. FDA will continue to inspect Odwalla regularly to ensure HACCP compliance. [FDA Consumer, Jan-Feb, 1999] Comment. Some classic investigations from FDA files. Look how long it takes to investigate, report and prosecute even after fatal outcomes. The company is still in business, bottoms up. HHS RELEASES FINAL REPORT OF SCIENCE PANEL ON INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATION AND HEALTH On April 28th, 1999, the Science Panel on Interactive Communication and Health, an independent body convened by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), released its final report, Wired for Health and Well-Being: The Emergence of Interactive Health Communication. The report, a landmark analysis of the emerging field of interactive health communication, identifies specific opportunities for reducing risks and expanding benefits associated with these new technologies. \"Emerging communication tools, such as the Internet, can help us spread the prevention message and promote health in ways that previous generations could only dream of,\" stated U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher. In the foreword to the report, he wrote, \"The rapid development of new technologies, coupled with the explosive growth of the Internet, brings opportunities for people to find interactive information, education, and support that is tailored to their needs and preferences.\" The Science Panel was convened to examine the potential impact of health communication technology on the health of the public and to accelerate its appropriate development, use, and evaluation. The Panel coined the term \"interactive health communication\" (IHC) to refer to the use of information or communication technology to access or provide health information, guidance, and support. IHC includes health-related Web sites and non-networked software applications. The Science Panel proposed four broad strategies for ensuring that IHC will enhance health and healthcare: 1) strengthen the evaluation and quality of applications, 2) improve basic knowledge and understanding of IHC, 3) enhance capacity of people to develop and use IHC, and 4) improve access to IHC for all populations. They concluded that IHC has great potential to improve health but may also cause harm. Their report, Wired for Health and Well-Being, outlines the potential for inaccurate, inappropriate, or poor design to result in harmful health outcomes. \"To date, there has been little evaluation or quality control of IHC because applications have developed faster than theory and assessment tools,\" stated Science Panel Chair, David Gustafson, PhD, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"With so many consumers relying on health information on the Web, we need to ensure that we do no harm.\" \"This consensus report is a clarion call to all stakeholders - application developers, consumers, health professionals and healthcare organizations, policymakers, and others - to work together and leverage the potential power of IHC to improve health, reduce health disparities, and contain healthcare costs,\" stated Science Panel Study Director Thomas Eng, VMD, MPH. A central area of concern outlined in the report is the lack of public disclosure of information for consumers to judge the credibility of the health information they are viewing and to make informed decisions. Withother consumer products, such as pr ocessed foods and cars, essential information about the identity of the producer and content of the product are routinely disclosed. The Science Panel proposes that application developers and sponsors routinely post such information on their Web sites or other applications, and offers an \"evaluation reporting template\" and \"disclosure statement,\" available free at www.scipich.org, to help implement this practice. \"Consumers should be informed shoppers when it comes to the Internet,\" stated Mary Jo Deering, PhD, Director of Telehealth at the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, HHS. She pointed out the availability of pre-selected quality online health information resources for consumers, including information on fraud and quackery, at www.healthfinder.gov, the federal government's health portal. The Science Panel is comprised of 14 nationally recognized experts from a wide variety of disciplines related to interactive technologies and health: medicine, human-computer interaction, public health, communication sciences, educational technology, and health promotion. The panel conducted its analyses over two and a half years and published six articles that recently appeared in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association (see press kit). The Science Panel and its Web site at www.scipich.org are managed by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP), HHS. The entire report, adapted for Web viewing, is posted at www.scipich.org/pubs/finalreport.htm. The public can order a copy for a $10 handling fee by calling the ODPHP's Communication Support Center at 1-800-336-4797. Comment: Getting reliable health information has been challenged by the Internet but now a major government report has some suggestions to help. MANNATECH TELLS CONSUMERS AND INVESTORS DIFFERENT TALES David Evans COPPELL, TEXAS, MARCH 5: Mannatech Inc. tells consumers scientific studies show its nutritional supplements are safe, promote good health and are even covered by a health insurance plan. Investors get another story. In documents for its initial public stock sale last month, Mannatech told potential buyers it doesn't know if its products are safe, or even if they work. Stephen Boyd, a physician who is Mannatech's international medical director, praises its supplements in a recorded message for prospective customers. He says the products facilitate the body's ability to heal itself and are \"inherently non-toxic.\" Coppell, Texas-based Mannatech warned in the share-sale prospectus, however, that there is no assurance its products, \"even when used as directed, will have the effects intended, or will not have harmful side effects.\" \"Why are they telling consumers one thing and investors another,\" asked Stephen Barrett, a medical doctor and chairman of Quackwatch Inc, a not-for-profit organization that monitors healthcare fraud. \"A company has a responsibility to determine its products are safe and effective before it sells them.\" Company executives declined to comment about the products, which are sold through more than 400,000 independent agents nationwide and in Australia. The company, which has plans to expand in the UK and Japan, had sales of $122.9 million for the first nine months of 1998. Mannatech's president, Sam Caster, speaks on a recorded message about a patent-pending Mannatech product called Ambrotose, which is blended from eight sugars and costs $39 for a bottle of 60 tablets. Healing Aid \"Ambrotose transcends all forms of malady because it supplies the body with those unique components that truly allow the body to heal itself,\" Caster says. In its IPO filing, Mannatech cautioned investors that its MVP product, marketed for weight control, contains ephedrine, a substance the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has linked to heart attacks, strokes and death. There are no warnings in the company's literature for consumers about MVP. The FDA, which has received more than 800 reports of adverse events associated with ephedrine, has proposed banning its sale for weight control. While Mannatech says it has an eight-member scientific team, its monthly magazine recently said there are no double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of the type used by drug companies establishing that its products work. It said it spent 0.25 percent of sales on research and development between 1995 and 1997, or about $667,000. Mannatech offers consumers insurance called MannaCare that reimburses up to 50 percent of the cost of its supplements. It also provides full medical, dental and vision coverage for premiums of up to $9,120 annually. Last Resort The insurance is offered through U.S. Alliance, a Crofton, Maryland, insurer that said it's unlicensed in the state. \"There wasn't an insurer they met with in the last three years that would reimburse\" for Mannatech products, said Walter Nieves, president of U.S. Alliance. \"That's why they came to me.\" Nieves said he doesn't need a license because his plan is exempt from state regulation. Regulators aren't sure. Maryland insurance regulators yesterday ordered Nieves to explain why he isn't violating state criminal law that forbids insurance sales by unlicensed companies. \"We regard this as an urgent matter requiring an immediate response,\" said Dennis Carroll, Deputy Insurance Commissioner. Mannatech's President Caster, 48, is no stranger to product promotion or the inquires of state officials. In 1991, his Eagle Shield Inc. claimed its Electracat device would repel insects and other pests by emitting high-frequency vibrations. The Texas Attorney General disagreed. \"The device is a hoax and stands on the same scientific footing as a perpetual motion machine,\" said Assistant Attorney General William Goodman, who won a permanent injunction against Caster and Eagle Shield in Travis County District Court. Caster agreed to stop selling the Electracat, not make unsupported scientific claims about any other product and pay $125,000 in investigative costs. Energy Product Two years earlier, Caster and Eagle Shield were accused of deceiving consumers by claiming their Eagle Shield Radiant Barrier was a scientific breakthrough in home insulation and provided significant savings in energy costs. The Texas Attorney General got a court order banning such claims after arguing the product had been available for more than 40 years and that the energy-saving claims were false. Caster and the company agreed not to make more false statements, and Eagle Shield filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Caster co-founded Mannatech in 1993 and took it public last month. Nearly half the 5.3 million shares went unsold at the self-underwritten initial public offering on Feb. 11. Only 3.1 million shares were sold, half owned by insiders including Caster. So who drove up Mannatech's shares from $8 at the sale to 44 1/2 two days later, valuing the company at more than $1 billion? John Coffee, professor of securities law at Columbia University Law School, suspects they were so-called day traders, who bought because the stock was moving up and they thought theycould sell for a quick profit. \"They weren't interested in the fundamentals,\" he said. Mannatech's fundamentals include current liabilities that exceeded assets on Sept. 30 by $11.3 million. Its net tangible book value before the offering was $493,000, or 2 cents a share. Sales increased 11 percent in the first nine months of 1998 from the year-earlier period. That's down from the pace of 1996 to 1997, when sales grew 67 percent. Earnings fell 3 percent in the first nine months of 1998. From 1996 to 1997, earnings grew 48 percent annually, with profit in 1997 of $10.6 million, or 50 cents a share. Mannatech's shares traded today at 11 7/16, cutting the company's value to $270 million. Reprinted by permission.

Former chiropractor Markell D. Boulis, has been sentenced to 41 months imprisonment and ordered to pay restitution of $1,100,000 Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation and ten insurance companies that he and two of his companies cheated in a fraudulent billing scheme between 1999 and 2003. Boulis was also ordered to pay restitution to Medicare and the Internal Revenue Service. In April, Boulis and two of his companies, Practice Solutions, Inc., and National Insurance Auditors, LLC, pled guilty to one count of health care fraud. Court documents indicate that Boulis set up a \"practice management\" consulting business for chiropractors about three months after the state of Pennsylvania suspended his chiropractor's license. Practice Solutions, Inc. would sponsor \"practice building\" seminars for chiropractors throughout the country. During the seminars, participants were told that National Insurance Auditors, LLC, was a separate, independent company comprised of \"experts\" in the review of patient records. This company could help attendees identify \"lost\" income resulting from services which had not been properly reimbursed by insurers due to incorrect coding, or a failure to bill for the services. Chiropractors were encouraged to contract with National Insurance Auditors, LLC for \"back-billing\" services as a means to generate additional income. As part of the scheme, Boulis's associates promised to audit the chiropractors' records to look for services that had been performed but not billed. However, government investigators found that the auditors merely copied the records and the billing company billed for new or additional services that had not been performed.
