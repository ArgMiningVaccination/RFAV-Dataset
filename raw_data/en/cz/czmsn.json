Some of the reasons for vaccination hesitancy and refusals have been attributed to unique aspects of this pandemic, including attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. However, little attention has been paid to the role of underlying vaccine beliefs in the likelihood of early vaccine adoption for COVID-19. This study provides a more comprehensive assessment of factors influencing willingness to get an early vaccination, and the relative contribution of general vaccine attitudes, compared to demographics, perceived threat and institutional trust. Monthly national surveys were conducted between June and November 2020 using a national consumer panel of U.S. adults (n = 6185). By late November, only 24% of respondents said they were very likely to get a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it became available. While COVID-19 risk perceptions, confidence and trust in key institutions and information sources, and some demographic variables, were predictive of early vaccination intent, general beliefs regarding vaccines played a significant role, even compared to demographics, perceived risk and institutional trust. This lesson from the COVID-19 experience could help inform public health communications in future epidemics.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-01-20", "cleaned_text": "Understanding the Impact of General Vaccine Attitudes on the Intent for Early COVID-19 Vaccination [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11020235](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11020235) [Recent Advances in Factors Associated with Vaccine Hesitancy and Acceptance]( /journal/vaccines/special_issues/4H64ERB803 )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-11-00235)]. Two vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) were developed for COVID-19 and found to be 95% effective in clinical trials in November 2020. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization for both vaccines in December 2020. At that time, the COVID-19 death toll in the United States had surpassed 300,000. In the absence of effective containment or mitigation of the virus, high vaccination coverage was widely considered critical for limiting the impact, and slowing the spread, of the virus. However, early adoption of the COVID-19 vaccines was slow in the US, despite universal eligibility for adults after the first few months, widespread availability and no cost for the vaccine. By 22 May 2021, only 57.0% of adults aged 18 or older had received at least one vaccine dose [ [2](#B2-vaccines-11-00235)]. Indeed, nearly two years after the approval of these vaccines, only 80% of the US population had received at least one dose of the vaccine, and only 68% were fully vaccinated [ [3](#B3-vaccines-11-00235)]. [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00235), [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00235)]. Potential objections to COVID-19 vaccination include believing the benefits do not outweigh the risks or that the vaccine may be unsafe due to the accelerated development and testing timeline [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00235), [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00235), [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00235), [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00235), [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00235)]. Inconsistent and changing government responses to COVID-19 may have eroded trust in public health, medical institutions and government and added to challenges related to convincing people to accept vaccination. Prior research involving influenza vaccine hesitancy suggests additional reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. For example, a meta-analysis of barriers to flu vaccination found low perceived risk of serious influenza illness, perceived lack of vaccine effectiveness and benefits, and a perceived lack of incentives for getting vaccinated were the most consistent and significant vaccination barriers [ [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00235)]. A national survey of U.S. born African American and White adults obtained similar results, with greater hesitancy to vaccines in general and flu vaccine specifically associated with lower rates of adult vaccination [ [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00235)]. [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00235), [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00235), [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00235)], this study extended previous research about predictors of early adoption intentions for COVID-19 vaccines by examining whether general beliefs about vaccines are predictive of vaccination intentions, independently of demographics, perceptions regarding COVID-19 risks, confidence in government agencies, public health experts and information from them about the virus. This examination of the role of general beliefs about vaccines, rather than beliefs specifically about COVID-19 vaccines, in early vaccination intent is a unique aspect of this study. We conducted a review of questions entries with \"vaccine\" or \"vaccines\" in the Societal Experts Action Network (SEAN) COVID-19 Survey Archive of COVID questionnaires. The only such survey questions identified in this archive were on vaccine beliefs specific to COVID-19 or influenza, not beliefs toward vaccines in general [ [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00235)]. Consequently, surveys to date have not explored core beliefs toward vaccines and whether they may play a significant role in causing hesitancy or refusals in COVID-19 vaccinations in the US. This is important in understanding whether the hesitancy to COVID-19 vaccinations is attributable to the unique aspects of the COVID pandemic and vaccine development or is more indicative of a broader public resistance to vaccinations. This, in turn, speaks to the relevancy of lessons learned from COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for future public health programs. [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00235), [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00235), [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00235), [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00235)]. In addition, the likelihood of COVID-19 immunization has also been related to demographic factors, including political affiliation [ [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00235), [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00235), [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00235)]. [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00235), [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00235)] by using a series of repeated cross-sectional surveys that utilized early vaccination intention measures to examine (1) current beliefs toward vaccines, in general, among adults in the United States, (2) whether these general beliefs toward vaccines are predictive of COVID-19 vaccination intentions and (3) the relative contribution of general vaccine beliefs towards COVID-19 vaccine acceptance compared to risk perceptions regarding the virus, confidence in institutions to manage the virus and trust in the information about the virus, and demographic factors. We would note that one study has found a significant contribution of general vaccine beliefs in COVID-19 vaccination status in late 2021, but none have examined its role in intent for early vaccine adoption for COVID-19 [ [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00235)]. 2. Research Method 2.1. Participants [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00235)]. The same panel, samples, questionnaire and study protocol have been used for other studies on different topics, which will include similar descriptions [ [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00235)]. Respondents were drawn from the MFour mobile panel, which comprised approximately two million persons in the United States. The full panel was not designed as a representative sample, but rather as a sampling frame from which geographically and demographically representative samples can be constructed from the panel profile. Although the company says that it takes care to include traditionally underrepresented groups in its sample, we drew our monthly samples as Census balanced national samples based on the panel profile information. [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00235), [28](#B28-vaccines-11-00235)]. Although high response rates are desirable to reduce the risk of bias in survey estimates and increase confidence in the results, research suggests that non-response bias is not necessarily associated with response rate [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00235)]). This study was reviewed and approved by our Institutional Review Board for the protection of human subjects. 2.2. Survey Measures [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00235)]. We would note that measures such as \"Some vaccines may cause learning disabilities, such as autism\" and \"Some vaccines have ingredients that could be harmful\" do not list the range of disabilities or ingredients that might concern respondents. Rather, they represent relatively broad, but distinct, types of beliefs that the public may hold about vaccines. These vaccine beliefs were assessed using agree/disagree statements, and a and \"strongly agree\". To avoid confusion with COVID-19 related vaccine beliefs, they were introduced immediately after general health questions and questions related to seasonal flu vaccinations and before any questions related to COVID-19. The survey invitation and introduction did not mention the COVID-19 virus or the pandemic to avoid non-response bias related to the topic. [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00235)]. Most of the other dependent variables were structured as four-point ordinal variables, although risk of getting the virus and risk of dying if contracting the virus were ratio level variables ranging from 0 to 100. 2.3. Statistical Analyses [Appendix B](#app2-vaccines-11-00235). 3. Results [Table 1](#vaccines-11-00235-t001). Demographics of the unweighted samples by wave are presented in [Appendix A](#app1-vaccines-11-00235). 3.1. Early and Later Immunization Intent [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00235-t002)). These findings are consistent with findings from other published polls during this period [ [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00235), [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00235), [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00235)]. For example, the Pew Center conducted national surveys in April/May, September and November 2020 using the question: \"If a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 were available today, would you definitely get the vaccine, probably get the vaccine, probably NOT get the vaccine, or definitely NOT get the vaccine?\" The proportion reporting that they would definitely/probably get the vaccine was 72% in April/May, 51% in September and 60% in November. This compares to the 63% in our survey that would be very/somewhat likely to get a COVID-19 as soon as one becomes available in May, 52.4% in September and 53.5% in November. Differences in question wording, such as the inclusion in our measure of \"as soon as one becomes available\" likely contributes to differences in estimates. Only 37% of adults in the Pew November survey reported that they would be comfortable in being one of the first groups of people to get the vaccine once a vaccine is approved in the US [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00235)]. 3.2. General Vaccine-Related Beliefs [Table 3](#vaccines-11-00235-t003)). These findings are similar to those of another study of general vaccine beliefs in August 2021 [ [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00235)]. [Table 4](#vaccines-11-00235-t004)). Similarly, the beliefs that vaccines are important to my health and my being vaccinated is important to health of others in my community were highly correlated (0.697). The perception that some vaccines are linked to long term health problems was strongly correlated with the beliefs that some vaccines may cause learning disabilities (0.680) and some vaccines may contain ingredients that could be harmful (0.644). These findings are similar to those of the August 2021 study on vaccination outcomes [ [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00235)]. 3.3. Correlation of Immunization Beliefs and Intent of Early COVID-19 Immunization [Table 5](#vaccines-11-00235-t005)). Although some of the vaccination belief items produced only a modest amount of \"not sure\" responses (i.e., 5-8%), six of them produced \"not sure\" responses between 13% and 28%. In a parallel analysis, the \"not sure\" responses were recoded to the middle of the scale between agree and disagree. This approach resulted in very little reduction in the correlations and no difference that was statistically significant. Consequently, our multivariate analyses treated \"not sure\" as a midpoint on the agreement/disagreement scale since this recoding minimized the loss of predictive power while including virtually all cases. 3.4. Predicting COVID-19 Vaccination Intention Separately with Demographics, COVID-Specific Attitudes and Experiences, and General Vaccine Beliefs [Table 6](#vaccines-11-00235-t006)). [Table 7](#vaccines-11-00235-t007)). [Table 8](#vaccines-11-00235-t008)). 3.5. Combined Regression of Demographic, COVID-19 Specific and General Vaccine Beliefs [Table 9](#vaccines-11-00235-t009)). 4. Discussion [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00235), [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00235), [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00235), [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00235)], the results provide important insights into associations between perceptions, demographics, and COVID-19 vaccination intentions. Consistent with other surveys [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00235), [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00235), [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00235), [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00235), [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00235)], respondents who were men, older, white, had more formal education and indicated a Democratic affiliation were more likely to get a COVID vaccination as soon as it was available, while Republicans and those living in suburban and rural areas were somewhat less likely. This demographic profile is consistent with many reports of actual COVID-19 vaccination. However, what is notable from our study is that after controlling for general beliefs about vaccination and other COVID-19 related factors, only the male gender, non-black race, and Democratic party affiliation were significant independent predictors of early vaccination intent, and their effects were relatively small. 5. Limitations [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00235), [33](#B33-vaccines-11-00235)]. Although the non-probability sample is a limitation, we believe that this study meets the \"fit-for-purpose\" criteria for survey design, and there are no probability samples providing equivalent data. 6.
