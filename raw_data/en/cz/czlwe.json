I was a PhD candidate in Political Theory at Johns Hopkins University from 2015-2021. After having been sucked into toxic spirituality & wellness myself, I've been outspoken on Tiktok about the dangers of New Age, wellness purity and fearmongering. In doing so, I discovered an entire community of people, who like me, got wrapped up in spiritual spaces that did not accurately reflect their political values. I realized that that's exactly what the spiritual sector is missing. Robust, decolonial, leftist, radical education & teaching so that we can shift the discourse. This work requires support and a community and that's why I'm here!", "sitename": "It's Classic Steph", "date": "2015-01-01", "cleaned_text": "It's "}
