Have you ever cried during or after an acupuncture treatment? Though it is not something that happens very often, it is not an uncommon occurrence either. Our busy lives sometimes make us forget that, crying can be a natural emotional response! Acupuncture works by activating your immune system, and increasing circulation in specific places. Part of this process is getting your body to naturally detox or get rid of wastes, fluids or things you've been holding onto for too long, more effectively. After acupuncture you might notice you sweat a little more, are very thirsty, urinate a lot, or have a big bowel movement \u2014these are natural ways the body cleanses itself. Sometimes that detoxification is of emotions and tears. Why Does Acupuncture Make Me Cry? Acupuncture stimulates the release of endorphins, serotonin, and other neurotransmitters, which have a profound effect on our emotions. Repressed or suppressed feelings can come to the surface during the treatment, when you are feeling relaxed, safe and a little more vulnerable. Acupuncture is known for its ability to free stuck or stagnate circulation. Once our emotions are allowed to flow more freely, it can result in a more dramatic release. Some people who seek out acupuncture have been in a state of imbalance or pain for a long time. Acupuncture is also known for its function of releasing natural painkillers in the body. In some cases, when you let go of the pain you have been experiencing, you can also begin to feel that you are letting go of the part of yourself that was unwell. When we go through a transformation in our lives, it can result in emotional and spiritual shifts. We change how we see ourselves and the world around us. This is all a part of healing. Can Herbal Medicine Cause An Emotional Release? As acupuncture can create the release of emotions and tears as part of the detoxification process, herbal medicine also can have this effect for certain people too. Carolyn Egan, of [Acknowledge Wellness](https://www.acknowledgewellnessllc.com), a Chinese Medicine Practitioner who primarily focuses on herbal medicine and food therapy has also noticed this reaction in certain patients that they see clinically. It is not uncommon for Carolyn's patients to notice that while they have been on an herbal formula, they notice they're crying more. \"Sometimes it may have occurred out of the blue to them which felt like a release, while other times, it was crying due to finally feeling a sense of nourishment that they have not had before (it could relate to physical, emotional or spiritual nourishment)\", Carolyn explains. Carolyn also shares, \"there are quite a bit of patients I work with who are also navigating multiple layers of grief. Oftentimes, in these sessions and follow-ups with herbs, there's a lot of tears that relate to multiple factors: release of detox pathways, release of being supported enough to cry and release of being witnessed. They often express how the herbs have helped them to move stagnation along with providing the nourishment they're looking for to feel fully supported and move forward.\" It's important to note that crying as a result of treatment is considered normal and can be a sign of the treatment's therapeutic effects. Most acupuncturists and herbalists are aware of how emotions can release and are prepared to hold space for you. If you have concerns about your emotional response from treatment, it's always a good idea to discuss them with your provider for further guidance and support. Please also note that though Chinese Medicine can do a lot of things for you, but it should not replace psychotherapy. Please be sure to seek a licensed therapist for your mental and emotional well being.
