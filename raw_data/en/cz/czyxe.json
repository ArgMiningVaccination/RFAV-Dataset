Whether you're an individual who suffers from certain sensitivities or simply want to promote environmental friendliness, you'll find non-toxic Live and Sleep mattresses to be the perfect products for you. Your mattress could be making you sick if it's made of traditional polyurethane memory foam. While our mattresses are made using memory foam, our foams are CertiPUR-US\u00ae and OEKO-TEX\u00ae certified, with minimal levels of chemicals. Over time Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) can contribute to poor air quality and affect individuals' mental and physical health. VOCs are also harmful for the environment. Each mattress we offer is made to minimize VOC levels to give you a mattress that helps keep you at your healthiest. Unlike other mattresses, ours are made without the use of chemical flame retardants, as part of our CertiPUR-US\u00ae certification. However, our mattress are still flame-resistant, but without the use of harmful chemicals. Most chemical flame retardants are toxic for the environment and individuals' health. They have been linked to birth defects, infertility, behavioral problems in children, and have also been linked to kidney, liver, breast, and testicular cancers. Many companies may even neglect to mention the use of chemical flame retardants in their manufacturing process, because they're not required to disclose their usage. Many mattress companies may attempt to avoid disclosing the unhealthy nature of their mattresses, but we make no claims that conceal any harm that our mattresses may otherwise cause. Our OEKO-TEX\u00ae and CertiPUR-US\u00ae helps us guarantee that you'll receive an eco-friendly and safe mattress with every purchase. Our legal label discloses all information necessary to assure you that our mattresses are made only of the materials we claim to use. One of the reasons we manufacture mattresses with only non-toxic materials is because of our belief that the environment matters. We are more concerned with quality rather than quantity when it comes to manufacturing, which helps us make sure that every mattress is made using only the safest and highest-quality materials. All of our mattresses are designed to last for many years, which also means our customers won't need to dispose of our mattresses frequently.
