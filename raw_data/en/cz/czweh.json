Without dismissing or underrating modern medicine, Extending Practical Medicine is an attempt to extend the approach of allopathic medicine beyond its present materialistic outlook to a fuller view of the human condition. Steiner and Dr Wegman felt \"it was important to add to existing knowledge the insights that can come from true perception of the spirit, enabling us to understand the processes of illness and healing.\" Dr. Ita Wegman founded the Institute of Clinical Medicine in Arlesheim, Switzerland and devoted her efforts to developing the principles outlined in this book. Trans: A. R. Meuss (GA27); 144pp Rudolf Steiner paperback See also: Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) called his spiritual philosophy 'anthroposophy', which he defined as 'the consciousness of one's humanity', and the disciplined methods of studying this he termed spiritual science. As a highly developed clairvoyant and spiritual initiate, he spoke from his direct cognition of the spiritual world. However, he did not see his work as religious or sectarian, but rather sought to found a universal 'science of the spirit'. His many published works (written books and lectures) - which include his research into the spiritual nature of the human being, the evolution of the world and humanity, and methods of personal development - invite readers to develop their own spiritual faculties. He also provided indications for the renewal of many human activities, including education - both general and special - agriculture, medicine, economics, architecture, science, philosophy, religion and the arts. He wrote some 30 books and delivered over 6000 lectures across Europe, and in 1924 founded the General Anthroposophical Society which today has branches throughout the world.
