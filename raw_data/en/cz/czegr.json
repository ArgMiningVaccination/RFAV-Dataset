(7) More on the history of matcha and meditation Matcha has numerous well-studied health benefits, though the specific history of matcha and meditation is a long one. (Of course, for you, we'll keep it brief) Green tea ceremonies have roots that date back centuries into Chinese Buddhism. Still, it wasn't until Japan that matcha tea truly developed in harmony with the practice of Zen Buddhism and meditation. Japanese zen monks first discovered matcha's value to mindfulness when they drank the vibrant green tea before long hours of meditation practice. The monks found that drinking matcha enhanced their ability to meditate and focus for hours on end. Drinking matcha enhanced their focus and kept them awake during long meditation sessions. It wasn't long before the common Japanese people began regularly drinking matcha green tea in traditional tea ceremonies. (6) The kinds of traditional tea ceremonies you see today. Known as Sado in Japanese, a traditional matcha tea ceremony is a mindful way of preparing matcha. Sado, which literally means the way of tea, is a traditional Japanese ritual of moving meditation. Sado is about the practice of grace, being present, and showing respect through a series of exact movements. (6) (10) The are two primary types of traditional Japanese tea rituals. One is called Chaji, which can last up to five hours and involves some meal or sweet treats. The second one is Chakai, a much simpler and shorter version that does not include a meal.

You can also try practicing [Dr. Weil's 4-7-8 breathing technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8fjYPC-k2k). Step 2: Then, thoughtfully open your eyes but keep your gaze soft as you layout your matcha and other supplies. This can be a bowl, whisk, electric frother, teapot, bowl, or any other accessories or ingredients you are adding to your matcha beverage. Step 3: Delicately scoop your desired serving of matcha and place it carefully in your cup or bowl. You can do this by using a [traditional matcha tea scoop](https://matcha.com/collections/accessory/products/tea-scoop-chashaku), teaspoon, or small dry kitchen spoon. You can take a few moments to admire the bright, vivid green coloring and beauty. What emotion does the vibrant green make you feel?

Find your [bamboo matcha whisk](https://matcha.com/collections/accessory/products/tea-whisk-chasen) or [electric frother](https://matcha.com/collections/accessory/products/electric-bamboo-frother), and stay in the present moment by focusing on finding a rhythm with your whisking. If your mind begins to wander while you are whisking, just come back to concentrate on your breath and take in the vibrant green matcha tea until it froths. Please take a moment to appreciate how it looks, inspecting the froth bubbles. Step 5: Thoughtfully add any additional ingredients to your matcha tea- perhaps you are making an [iced matcha latte](https://matcha.com/blogs/news/how-to-make-a-matcha-latte-matcha-green-tea-latte-recipe) with oat milk or like a little bit of maple syrup for sweetness. Please take a moment after adding each ingredient and think about how much energy, effort, and willpower it took for that ingredient to wind up in your kitchen. Step 6: Take your first sip. Take a few moments to observe and enjoy as your matcha swishes around your mouth. Try and identify the different tastes and flavor tones your matcha evokes. Let images come to mind and pass. Then, if your mind wanders, come back to your breath and look at your beautifully prepared matcha tea. Step 6: Give gratitude back to your matcha tea and those who produced it. Please take a few moments to consider all the people it took to bring you this one little cup of matcha tea that's now in the palm of your hands. Step 7: Allow your gratitude and feeling of connection to wash over you physically. Close your eyes and take a moment to visualize your appreciation filling up from your toes all the way to the crown of your head.
