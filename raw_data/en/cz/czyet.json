Introduction [1](#B1-children-01-00424)]. IT can be classified into mind-body interventions (hypnosis/hypnotherapy, meditation, faith healers, imagery), energy field therapies (acupuncture, acupressure, reiki, qi gong, therapeutic touch), body work (massage, osteopathic manipulation), and biological agents (vitamins, traditional Chinese medicine/herbs, nutritional supplements, plant extracts). 1.1. IT Use in Children and Adolescents with Cancer [2](#B2-children-01-00424)]. They found that these prior surveys yielded inconsistent results; IT prevalence ranged from 6%-91% in the prior studies (although most were in the range of 20%-60%). Some of the inconsistency resulted from different definitions of IT in different studies and different methodology. For example, some studies list types of IT in the survey, while others ask open-ended questions regarding use. In the latter case, some respondents might not consider their practices, such as taking vitamins, or spiritual healing, to be \"IT\" and therefore might under-report. Additionally, studies report on different patient populations, including multiple different countries, where practices may differ greatly. The most commonly and consistently reported IT modalities were herbal remedies, diets and nutrition, and faith-healing. IT was primarily employed by patients to cure or help fight the child's cancer, to provide symptomatic relief, and to support conventional medicine, such as to relieve toxicities. The analysis reported that IT use was not associated with gender, age, ethnicity, or family income of pediatric patients with cancer. [3](#B3-children-01-00424)]. In this study, IT use actually dropped after the cancer diagnosis, with 41% reporting use prior to the diagnosis and only 31% since the diagnosis. Of note, this study did not include prayer/spiritual healing which may partly explain the low rates. An interesting finding in this study was that 78% of patients informed a physician of their IT use, a number higher than that cited in other studies, though only 16% of the attending pediatric oncologists reacted approvingly. Since a portion of patients stopped use after diagnosis, this may indicate that physician disapproval influences patients' discontinuation of IT use. Other studies have documented that most patients and parents do not discuss their use of IT with their physicians, and most pediatric oncologists do not ask about IT use [ [4](#B4-children-01-00424), [5](#B5-children-01-00424), [6](#B6-children-01-00424), [7](#B7-children-01-00424), [8](#B8-children-01-00424)]. This fact is striking given that most pediatric oncology patients are participating in clinical trials where concomitant medications and their side effects are important to track and report [ [4](#B4-children-01-00424)], and further compounded as many patients increase IT use when upfront therapy fails [ [8](#B8-children-01-00424)], a time when many patients are enrolled in studies of investigational agents subject to even closer monitoring. In a study of adults enrolled in phase I trials, 52% of patients were using some sort of integrative therapy, and 77% of those were using a pharmacologic form of IT. Only 23% of patients revealed their IT use to their physician despite the importance of discussing all medications used during a phase I trial [ [9](#B9-children-01-00424)]. [10](#B10-children-01-00424)]. This may suggest that physicians counseling patients at end of life might have been less negative about IT than those treating patients on cure-directed therapy. [7](#B7-children-01-00424)]. In Heath's study of bereaved parents, the majority (78%) of respondents felt their child had benefited from IT use, even though parents whose children had used IT reported significantly lower levels of \"child enjoyment\" during the last month of life than parents whose children had not used IT [ [10](#B10-children-01-00424)]. 2. Evidence for IT 2.1. Limitations of Research [11](#B11-children-01-00424), [12](#B12-children-01-00424)] Investigations of non-pharmacologic therapies such as massage and acupuncture are hampered by the challenges of finding appropriate placebos, and the difficulty of ensuring a uniform approach between practitioners and from patient to patient [ [13](#B13-children-01-00424), [14](#B14-children-01-00424)]. Even in studies of adults with cancer, many of the studies done lack adequate controls, or are very small and underpowered to demonstrate efficacy [ [15](#B15-children-01-00424), [16](#B16-children-01-00424)]. The rarity of childhood cancer further reduces the incentive for many IT providers to scientifically evaluate therapies in children and adolescents and the ability of studies to show an effect of intervention. 2.2. Multiple Modalities [17](#B17-children-01-00424)]. Poder performed a systematic review of all non-pharmacologic forms of IT and found fair evidence for some modalities, including massage, acupuncture, imagery, art therapy, and music therapy. Because of faulty design methods, very few modalities were able to be rated more than \"fair\", although evidence was slightly better for distraction and hypnosis which both have demonstrated improvements in pain, anxiety, distress, fear and nausea, especially in younger children. Evidence for chiropractic in pediatric oncology is lacking [ [18](#B18-children-01-00424)]. While evaluating non-pharmacological IT interventions specifically for pain and anxiety, Thrane found that most studies looked primarily at the effects of IT on these symptoms around procedures, and that hypnosis and music therapy were the most helpful in ameliorating procedure-related distress [ [19](#B19-children-01-00424)]. 2.3. Massage [20](#B20-children-01-00424)]. This finding is consistent with studies of massage in adults with cancer, where anxiety is the symptom most consistently reported as positively affected by massage, especially immediately after the massage [ [21](#B21-children-01-00424), [22](#B22-children-01-00424), [23](#B23-children-01-00424), [24](#B24-children-01-00424)]. Other symptoms improved by massage include pain, nausea, depression, anger, stress, and fatigue [ [25](#B25-children-01-00424), [26](#B26-children-01-00424), [27](#B27-children-01-00424), [28](#B28-children-01-00424), [29](#B29-children-01-00424), [30](#B30-children-01-00424)]. Most positive effects are short lived (immediately following the massage to within a half hour after), though some longer term effects have been noted [ [31](#B31-children-01-00424), [32](#B32-children-01-00424)]. [33](#B33-children-01-00424)]. Another Portuguese study revealed moderate improvements in pain interference [ [34](#B34-children-01-00424)]. A few studies have investigated massage in children undergoing bone marrow transplantation. In the first, 50 children with cancer undergoing bone marrow transplantation received professional massage, parent massage or were controls. Results indicated statistically significant differences in days to engraftment in the combined (parent and professional) massage group. Results from the professional massage group yielded a significant decrease in immediate anxiety and discomfort [ [35](#B35-children-01-00424)]. A follow up study at the same center compared a child intervention group (humor + massage), a parent intervention group (massage + relaxation) and standard of care control and found no differences in depression, quality of life, or post-traumatic stress, though all groups (intervention and control) improved over time and all groups had very high adjustment [ [36](#B36-children-01-00424)] Another smaller pilot study of three times weekly massage combined with acupressure versus standard of care control showed trends towards benefits in pain, nausea, fatigue and mucositits [ [37](#B37-children-01-00424)], and described high levels of parent/caregiver satisfaction with the intervention [ [38](#B38-children-01-00424)]. 2.4. Acupuncture and Acupressure [39](#B39-children-01-00424), [40](#B40-children-01-00424), [41](#B41-children-01-00424)], pain, fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia [ [42](#B42-children-01-00424), [43](#B43-children-01-00424)]. While evidence regarding use of acupuncture in pediatric conditions has not been as well demonstrated [ [14](#B14-children-01-00424)], acupuncture has been shown to be well tolerated in children [ [44](#B44-children-01-00424), [45](#B45-children-01-00424)], including no bleeding complications, even in thrombocytopenic patients [ [46](#B46-children-01-00424)]. Efficacy has been suggested in ameliorating pediatric pain (not oncology specific) [ [47](#B47-children-01-00424), [48](#B48-children-01-00424), [49](#B49-children-01-00424)] and in reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting [ [50](#B50-children-01-00424)]. In addition, a meta-analysis of the effects of acustimulation (acupuncture, acupressure and electrical stimulation) on post-operative nausea and vomiting showed that acustimulation significantly reduced both vomiting and nausea [ [51](#B51-children-01-00424)]. [52](#B52-children-01-00424), [53](#B53-children-01-00424)]. However, a large 3-arm adult oncology study that incorporated a sham acupressure arm demonstrated a decrease in nausea in both the sham and the real acupressure arms, emphasizing the high potential for placebo effect in these types of studies [ [54](#B54-children-01-00424)]. A pilot cross-over study in pediatric oncology patients showed that acupressure is safe, feasible, and well-received [ [55](#B55-children-01-00424)]; a larger randomized study is ongoing. 2.5. Mind-Body Therapies [56](#B56-children-01-00424)]. Other reviews of non-pharmacological interventions for procedure-associated distress have also agreed that hypnosis was helpful [ [19](#B19-children-01-00424), [57](#B57-children-01-00424)]. Additionally, a small retrospective study of meditation in children with neuroblastoma receiving monoclonal antibody therapy showed that meditation significantly reduced analgesic use [ [58](#B58-children-01-00424)]. 2.6. Energy Therapies [59](#B59-children-01-00424)]. Energy therapies include Reiki, therapeutic touch, and healing touch. These therapies have been minimally studied in adults with cancer. A recent review of biofield therapies in adults with cancer showed some conflicting effects on symptom reduction, but generally positive effects on pain reduction and psychological distress (anxiety, depression and stress), and improvements in quality of life. In several instances, the positive effects were not maintained, and there were some negative studies as well. In addition, most of the studies performed were not sufficiently powered or had a quasi-experimental design, limiting the usefulness of the data [ [60](#B60-children-01-00424)]. Another review of Reiki in adults with pain analyzed seven subjects (four were cancer patients) and suggested an effect on pain and anxiety [ [61](#B61-children-01-00424)]. There is even more limited data in pediatric oncology patients. One very small (nine patients) study of healing touch versus a \"reading/play\" control showed decreases in pain, stress, and fatigue for participants, parents, and caregivers [ [62](#B62-children-01-00424)]. Overall, energy therapies appear to be well received by children and adult cancer patients with no adverse effects, but the data supporting their use is lacking. 2.7. Yoga [63](#B63-children-01-00424), [64](#B64-children-01-00424)], reducing levels of salivary cortisol, plasma renin levels and urine nor-epinephrine and epinephrine levels [ [65](#B65-children-01-00424)], as well as lowering heart rate and blood pressure [ [66](#B66-children-01-00424)]. In adults with cancer, yoga has demonstrated improvements in fatigue [ [67](#B67-children-01-00424), [68](#B68-children-01-00424)]. Yoga has been found to be beneficial for physical and cardiopulmonary functioning in healthy children [ [69](#B69-children-01-00424)]. Two small studies showed that yoga is safe and feasible in pediatric cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy [ [70](#B70-children-01-00424), [71](#B71-children-01-00424)], but further research is needed to demonstrate efficacy for symptom management. 2.8. Select Herbs and Biologic Therapies [11](#B11-children-01-00424), [42](#B42-children-01-00424), [72](#B72-children-01-00424), [73](#B73-children-01-00424), [74](#B74-children-01-00424)]. Below are described select agents with evidence of effectiveness in symptom management or evidence of potential harm [ [75](#B75-children-01-00424)]. [76](#B76-children-01-00424)]. Of note, there have been reports of contamination of Chinese herbs, with drugs, toxins, or heavy metals, or with inaccurate descriptions of ingredients, making these medicines particularly challenging not only to study but also to recommend for the pediatric oncology population. Some small studies have demonstrated efficacy of some components [ [77](#B77-children-01-00424)], for example SAMITAL, for prevention or treatment of mucositis in adults [ [76](#B76-children-01-00424), [78](#B78-children-01-00424), [79](#B79-children-01-00424)]. [80](#B80-children-01-00424)]. [81](#B81-children-01-00424), [82](#B82-children-01-00424), [83](#B83-children-01-00424), [84](#B84-children-01-00424)], as well as shown promising, but inconsistent effects, on post-operative nausea and vomiting [ [85](#B85-children-01-00424), [86](#B86-children-01-00424), [87](#B87-children-01-00424), [88](#B88-children-01-00424)]. Several studies have assessed ginger for CINV in adults. In the largest study to date, Ryan et al. compared nausea severity in 644 adults receiving single-day chemotherapy who received one of three doses of ginger (0.5 g, 1.0 g, 1.5 g) to placebo. All doses of ginger significantly reduced nausea severity (p = 0.003), with the largest reduction in nausea severity at the 0.5 g/day and 1.0 g/day doses [ [89](#B89-children-01-00424)]. Ginger has not been well-studied in pediatric cancer patients. [42](#B42-children-01-00424)]. Probiotics may be beneficial in the setting of allogeneic stem cell transplant. In a murine model of acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD), L. rhamnosus GG before and after transplantation resulted in improved survival and reduced Agvhd [ [90](#B90-children-01-00424)]. In a small study of children receiving chemotherapy, patients treated with the Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult had fewer fevers and enhanced the habitation of anaerobes in the intestinal flora [ [91](#B91-children-01-00424)]. [92](#B92-children-01-00424)]. In studies of children undergoing stem cell transplants (SCT), glutamine decreased duration of fever [ [93](#B93-children-01-00424)] and use of both total parental nutrition (TPN) and narcotics compared to standard of care [ [94](#B94-children-01-00424)]. However, a small study of children receiving glutamine with chemotherapy showed no difference in the side effect profiles of the chemotherapy [ [95](#B95-children-01-00424)]. Glutamine has also been found to be helpful in preventing peripheral neuropathy in adults with cancer for example in patients on paclitaxel and oxaliplatin [ [96](#B96-children-01-00424)]. However, in a Children's Oncology Group randomized controlled trial of glutamic acid for the prevention of vincristine toxicity in pediatric oncology patients, glutamic acid was not found to prevent neuropathy [ [97](#B97-children-01-00424)]. [98](#B98-children-01-00424)]. Open-label studies in adult cancer patients, supplementation with L-Carnitine has been found to reduce cancer-related fatigue [ [99](#B99-children-01-00424)], however a large randomized trial showed no difference in fatigue compared to placebo [ [100](#B100-children-01-00424)]. [101](#B101-children-01-00424)]. [102](#B102-children-01-00424)]. However, there is concern that supplements promoted for their antioxidant qualities may diminish the efficacy of anticancer treatments, particularly radiation, that work through promotion of oxidizing free radicals [ [11](#B11-children-01-00424), [103](#B103-children-01-00424)]. Studies adequately evaluating the impact of supplementation on toxicity and disease free survival have not been completed, making it difficult to recommend these supplements for oncology patients on therapy. [104](#B104-children-01-00424)]. Its use may reduce the need for dose reductions in chemotherapy for hepatotoxicity, but larger randomized studies are warranted. [105](#B105-children-01-00424), [106](#B106-children-01-00424)] and is often used in children with cognitive and attention disorders, conditions which mimic some of the long term cognitive deficits in survivors of childhood cancer, though the evidence is still in development [ [107](#B107-children-01-00424), [108](#B108-children-01-00424)]. Since high doses of these supplements are well tolerated for various conditions, there appears little down side to recommending fish oil supplementation for childhood survivors experiencing or at risk of cognitive problems. 3. Risks of IT [72](#B72-children-01-00424)]. As mentioned above, there have been reports of heavy metal and microbial contamination of TCM herbs [ [109](#B109-children-01-00424)]. On the other hand, in a summary of all adverse events associated with the use of IT in children reported to an Australian registry, most of the severe events (and all of the death) were connected to those patients who used IT in lieu of conventional medicine, as opposed to as an adjunct [ [110](#B110-children-01-00424)]. While many side effects of herbs and interactions with chemotherapy remain unknown, some of the known and theoretical risks and interactions are available [ [73](#B73-children-01-00424), [111](#B111-children-01-00424), [112](#B112-children-01-00424)]. 4. How to Best Counsel patients about IT use [113](#B113-children-01-00424)], and National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine \"Topics A to Z\" [ [114](#B114-children-01-00424)].
