Indian Journal of Research in Homoeopathy as vaccines prevent between 2 and 3 million deaths from infectious diseases every year. However, it is important to recognise and manage adverse events (AEs) in a timely fashion to minimise possible harm. Due to a lack of adequate, approved and available alternatives, emergency use authorisation allowed the use of partially approved COVID-19 vaccines in response to a declared public health emergency. There is an ongoing debate regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and many people are opting not to get vaccinated due to mounting clinical evidence of harm from vaccines. Vaccine hesitancy in general has been frequently studied among healthcare workers and especially medical students. and is also encountered in the current COVID context. Although the speed and impact of the pandemic on older people with frailty justify an approach where they are offered vaccination first, patients and their caregivers and supervising healthcare professionals will need to make a decision on accepting...

Individuals with related allergies or otherwise restrained by doctors must avoid consumption of these ingredients. There maybe side effects similar to food poisoning. Regular monitoring for inter drug related affects/interactions is very much essential, if taken alongside other interventions. Take adequate preventive barrier precautions. Kindly adhere to the timings, mix, manner, quantities and frequency specified for consumption otherwise there can be other severe side effects that might not be manageable at individual level. INTERNATIONALJOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARYEDUCATIONALRESEARCH Background Women menstruate on an average between 13 and 50 years of age in low-income settings (but can start as early as from 8 years), amounting to a total of 1400 days of menstruation in a woman's lifetime [1]. It is a healthy biological process, which marks the passage from childhood to adolescents of girls. Introduction There is an increase in attention on girls' education by the global development community. As a result, we have seen improved retention and grade promotion for girls in many countries. With this progress, we find ourselves confronting both new challenges and opportunities for girls to achieve an equitable education. Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) is one among several challenges and opportunities. For girls, menarche and menstruation is a time of intense physical and emotional change for young people between the ages of 10 and 17. Puberty marks a transition between childhood and adulthood that impacts adolescents' physical, emotional and social wellbeing. Evidence shows that during puberty , adolescents embrace and solidify the gender norms of their society . So the way girls and boys see themselves within their family , community and society can be drastically altered for the rest of their lives. In some contexts, puberty leads to increased social restrictions for girls and increased social freedom for boys. Many adolescents, especially girls, will experience a severe drop in self-confidence during puberty . All of these factors, and more, contribute to the increased rates of risky social and health-related behaviors that many adolescents practice. Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) is part of the overall efforts within Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). MHM has an impact on development as it has implications on the life of girls and women related to health, education, work, mobility and security. This article gives a overview of why menstruation matters and how to consider menstrual hygiene management (MHM) Dev Sanskriti Interdisciplinary International Journal 2020 The need of the hour, in COVID19 crises, is to take care of the health from all aspects. A huge population of the world has not been only infected by Corona Virus but also a considerable number of persons have been deceased due to the acute symptoms of COVID19. As far no vaccine or approved medicine for COVID19 has been found by any country to date. So, the only weapon left to break the chain of the infection is to follow the precaution strategy given by various health experts. Along with precautions such as social distancing, wearing masks and gloves etc., the health experts have also revealed that weak immunity is the prime factor to come in the grip of the Corona Virus. In this research paper, the intuitive vision and indigenous immunity-boosting approaches from literature of visionary scholar Pandit Shriram Sharma Acharya from India, relevant to the pandemic state, have been compiled. The reason to focus on the writings of Pandit Shriram Sharma Acharya is his featured knowledge... International Journal of Multidisciplinary Educational Research <strong>Abstract</strong> Vaccination is perhaps one every of the foremost cost-effective interventions to cut back the burden of childhood morbidity and mortality, provided used optimally and judiciously. Currently, it's estimated that immunization saves the lifetime of 3 million children a year but 2 million more lives might be saved by existing vaccines. Research Design-In this study quantitative approach and quasi-experimental one-group Pre-test Post-test was used. Sample size-Total 30 samples were in this study. Sampling Method-Samples were selected through the purposive sampling technique and the setting was selected rural area of Bansa Tarkheda Village, Damoh. Method of data collection-Data is collected through a structured questionnaire. Results- To find out the significant difference between the mean score of pre and Post-test knowledge score and the Attitude score of the mothers regarding immunization paired 'to test was computed. The calculated value is higher than the table value, the null hypothesis was rejected and the research hypothesis was accepted. The results show that the mean Post-test knowledge score and Attitude scores of the mothers regarding immunization are significantly higher than their mean Pre-test knowledge scores and Attitude scores. conclusion-The researcher concluded that gain in knowledge and Attitude is not by chance but by STP on immunization. <br> https://www.ijhsr.org/IJHSR_Vol.11_Issue.8_Aug2021/IJHSR-Abstract.017.html Background and Objectives: Infection with COVID-19 has been linked to fungal diseases. The sudden increase in mucormycosis cases has sparked the scientific community interest. In this review, we attempted to investigate the role of Ayurveda and Homoeopathy in the treatment of mucormycosis. Methodology: The research was carried out in three stages; first step, studies on COVID-19 and mucormycosis were searched on various databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar until May 21, 2021, second step was to search authentic Ayurvedic and Homeopathic text books for the context of mucormycosis and symptoms were repertorised to find homeopathic medicines and finally, in the last step, findings were analysed and concluded in order to arrive at a factual solution. Result: We found total 16 search results from bio-medical databases of which 14 articles were included. Except source books, no studies with respect to Ayurveda and Homoeopathy were found in above databases. In Ayurveda, Rajyakshama and krimijshirorog has close like ashawagandha, giloya, tulsi, vidanga etc. Rhino-orbito-cerbral mucormycosis (ROCM) can with Arsenic album, Kali bichromicum, and Merc solubilis, while pulmonary mucormycosis (PM) with Arsenic album, Phosphorus indica. Similarly, mucormycosis be so on in Homoeopathy. Conclusion: In the absence of rigorous trials, the review results found no conclusive comment on the efficacy of CAM in mucormycosis, but anecdotal evidence suggests in favour. To demonstrate its role, rigorous, exploratory, pilot, randomised control trials should be conducted in the future, either alone or as an add-on.
