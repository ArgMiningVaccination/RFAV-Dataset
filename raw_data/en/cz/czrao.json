Gum biopolymers offer a greener alternative to synthetic polymers and toxic chemicals in the synthesis of metal nanostructures. Metal nanostructures accessible via eco-friendly means endow astounding characteristics to gum-based biocomposites in the field of diagnosis and therapy to- wards cancer diseases. In this review, assorted approaches for the assembly of nanomaterials mediated by gum biopolymers are presented and their utility in cancer diagnosis and therapy, e.g., bioimaging, radiotherapy, and phototherapy, are deliberated to provide a groundwork for future stimulative research. 1.Introduction Cancer, often prevails as a fatal disease despite enormous progress, and entails the uncontrolled growth and irregular spread of cells (Bar- abadi et al., 2019 ; Pinheiro et al., 2019 ). Early diagnosis and therapy of advancing cancer certainly improves the survivability of cancer patients. While chemotherapy remains a primary treatment approach, conven - tional regimens are often unsuitable due to inherent limitations, e.g. side effects, poor pharmacokinetics, and poor drug biodistribution (Wu and Yang, 2017 ). In some cases, chemotherapy must be combined with other types of adjuvant therapy to optimize the treatment (Cai et al., 2020 ). These limitations have led to the development of novel systems and the modulation of current therapeutic methods to enhance the treatment efficacy while reducing the side effects. Toward these goals, metal-based nanostructures (MBNs) are strong candidates offering multifaceted op- portunities for appliances in the field of oncology early-stage cancer detection, diagnosis/prognosis, and the development of personalized anti-cancer therapy (J. H. Kim et al., 2019b ; Zare et al., 2020 ). author Pontedera 56025, Pisa, Italy. **Corresponding author at: Regional Centre and Materials (RCPTM), Palacky University, Olomouc, \u00afSlechtitel 11, ***Corresponding author at: Bryan Ronain Smith, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute for Quantitative Health Science & Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA Advances u{~zkw! s{yo| Received 2020; Received in revised form 26 December 2020; Accepted 2 February 2021 Biotechnology Advances 48 (2021) 107711 2commercially fabricated MBNs utilize toxic reagents and organic sol- vents and also produce hazardous by-products during their synthesis (Kalpana and Devi Rajeswari, 2018 ). Accordingly, green technologies may be deployed instead owing to their environmentally-friendly nature with lower toxicity for the synthesis of MBNs. Furthermore, these nanomaterials offer tremendous opportunities to deliver bioactive therapeutics (e.g., peptides, antibodies, and DNA/RNA) in a target- specific manner using sustainable synthetic technologies (Makvandi et al., 2020 ; Taneja, 2020 ; J. Wang et al., 2019a ). Natural biopolymers (e.g., gum carbohydrate) have been extensively employed in the pharmaceutical and medicinal fields as drug delivery vehicles and for the biogenic synthesis of nano-sized metals (Makvandi et al., 2019a, 2019b ; Zare et al., 2019b ) due to their distinctive structure and other attributes. Amongst these biopolymers, natural gum poly- saccharides are especially attractive because they are renewable, abundantly available, cost-effective, eco-friendly, and biocompatible. Generally, gums can be classified based on their origin and structure into microbial gums namely xanthan (AG) and seed gums like guar gum (GG) (V.V. T. Padil et al., 2018 ; Zare et al., 2019a ). Both gum carbohydrates and nanometals comprising hybrid bio- composites can improve the biological and physicochemical properties of the final platform. For instance, on one hand, gums can improve the biocompatibility of the biosynthesized metal nanoparticles (NPs) and serve as the vehicle to carry the drug payloads. Additionally, incorpo - ration of metals, such as gold and iron oxide into gum matrices does impart new characteristics (e.g., bio-imaging, therapeutic, and radio - active agents) that can be exploited in cancer diagnostics and thera - peutics. The fusion of functionalized nanometals and gums with various biomolecules, ligands, and drugs is ideally suited for bioimaging and cancer treatments, e.g. photo-, radio-, and chemotherapy (Fig. 1). These hybrid systems based on polymeric gums (e.g.GG and TG) and metals (e. g. gold or iron oxide) have been take advantage of in several biomedical applications (Dhar et al., 2008 ; Vieira et al., 2015 ). also Importantly, it has been revealed that coupling metal nanocarriers such as gold (de Barros et al., 2016 ; Iranpour et al., 2018 ), silver (Duan et al., 2020 ) and iron oxide (Samrot et al., 2019 ), does enhance their therapeutic effects besides contributing to their stability and biocompatibility. Surface functionalization of nanomaterials with a targeting ligand (e. g., bioactive molecules, amino acids, peptides, and nucleic acids) can improve the tumor/background ratio (TBR). Lack of such surface func- tionalization and decoration of nanostructures would result in their entrapment by the surrounding tissues, leading to a low TBR. Undeni - ably, the local delivery induces a higher sensitivity of tumor cells to therapeutic drugs, thereby culminating in reduced progression of metastasis (Dong and Mumper, 2010 ). However, challenges still persists for the targeted ligand-conjugated nanostructures to attain a satisfactory TBR to visualizing cancer 's boundary in view of their uptake by normal tissues (Jin et al., 2017 ). Based on these perspectives, the scope of the present review focuses on the recent advances in gum polysaccharide-mediated synthesis of MBNs with respect to cancer diagnosis and treatment. Specific appli - ances of metal-based nanostructures/gum polysaccharide biocomposites in various fields of cancer diagnosis and therapy, such as drug delivery, bioimaging, radio-, and photo-therapy, would provide a backdrop for future stimulative research. 2.Gum-mediated biosynthesis of nanometals MBNs are accessible via convenient synthetic approaches, in tunable size and shape, with unique interactions with electromagnetic energy, and display desirable effects toward many diseases (C. Wang et al., 2020a ). However, their biological application is often limited due to their low biocompatibility and associated adverse side effects (Xiong, 2013 ). often due to the use of hazardous agents and solvents. In this regard, recent introduction of eco-friendly approaches offer promising alternative strategy for the synthesis of MBNs. In these green chemistry approaches, the deployment of more benign solvents and materials to synthesize NPs has many potential benefits, such as biocompatibility and eco-friendliness (Makvandi et al., 2019b ; Makvandi et The use of gum polysaccharides for synthesizing nanometals has become a focus of intense research over the last decade (Zare et al., 2019a ) with several routes available for the assembly of MBNs using gum polysaccharides (Fig. 2A): a. ambient temperature; b. temperature- assisted, such as hydrothermal and regular heating via thermal stirrer; c. microwave-assisted; d. sonochemistry, using ultrasonics; e. photo - chemistry, using UV-visible light irradiation (Padil et al., 2016 ). In these synthetic processes, gums serve as reducing agents for the metal ions (e. g., the conversion of Ag\u0087ions to Ag0 NPs) as well as stabilizers for the metal NPs (Fig. 2B) (Fierascu et al., 2017 ). Various gum polysaccharides have been used for the greener syn- thesis of metal NPs at room temperature; Au NPs were biosynthesized with AG the bioreducing and biostabilizing agent at ambient tem- perature (25 C) with constant stirring for 4 h which could enhance the formation of AG stabilized-Au NPs by increasing the reaction tempera - ture from 25 C to 55 C (Wu and Chen, 2010 ). Similar temperature-assisted protocol has been described where chloroauric acid was reduced using acacia gum (AcG) by stirring for 4 h Fig. 1.Functionalized NPs for bioimaging and anticancer therapies in radiotherapy, phototherapy, and drug delivery; specific targeting of cancer cells enhances the efficacy of the treatment. P. Makvandi et al. Biotechnology Advances 48 (2021) 107711 3at 60 C to form Au NPs (Anwar et al., 2019 ). Magnesium with so- lution of TG at C for 80 min (Fardood et al., 2017 ). Au and CuO NPs were produced using native and carboxymethylated karaya gum (KaG), respectively by heating the metallic ions with gum solutions at 75 C for 40-60 min. (Gangapuram et al., 2017 ; V.V. T. Padil et al., 2018 ); simi- larly, Ag NPs were synthesized using homogeneous kondagogu gum (KG) solution at 121 C (Kora et al., 2010 ). The size and shape of Ag NPs were critically affected by modulating processing parameters including gum particle size (38-300 m) and its concentration (0.1-0.5 wt.%), Ag concentration (1-5 mM), and the time (10-60 min). Synthesis of Ag NPs was accomplished via the interaction of Ag ions with rhamnose, galac - tose, and uronic acid from KG(Kora et al., 2010 ); rhamnogalacturonan gum (RG) was used for producing Ag NPs, and Rastogi, 2018 and tree gum for assembly of Se NPs (Kora, 2018 ). The same method has also been employed for manufacturing Au NPs with KaG (Gangapuram et al., 2017 ; Seku et al., 2019 ). The microwave (MW)-assisted method involves the use of microwaves that penetrate through the glass vessel, couple with polar and ionic species selectively and assist in the expeditious formation of metal NPs by generating localized heat. By employing this method, synthesis of NPs has been achieved in minutes or seconds thus generating relatively small uniform-sized particles by preventing agglomeration, a much faster strategy (Baruwati et al., 2009 ; Gawande et al., 2014 ; Hebbalalu et al., 2013 ; Kou and Varma, 2013 ; Kou and Varma, 2012 ). Gold NPs have been prepared using this strategy in presence of olibanum gum (OG) (Guadie Assefa et al., 2017 ) and guar gum (GG) solutions (Ganeshkumar et al., 2018 ); Au NPs in the former Fig. 2.(A) Different alternate energy sources, such as light, temperature, ultrasonic-, microwave irradiation, and autoclave (combined heat with high pressure in closed container), can be used for the fabrication of nanometals. (B) Gum polysaccharide-mediated biosynthesis of metal-based nanoparticles.

The resulting GG-Au NPs, as targeted agents, were attached to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) on the surface which displayed very good 5-FU-GG-AuNPs treatment efficacy on human colon cancer cell line (HT-29) in vitro. Besides, GG can only be degraded by the colonic bacteria, thereby suggesting that such passive targeting can improve therapeutic efficiency of the formulation in vivo (Ganeshkumar et al., 2018 ; Guadie Assefa et al., 2017 ). The sono-synthesis technique utilizes ultrasound (low and high- frequency waves) for the biosynthesis of metal NPs (Soltani and Lee, 2016 ). Ultrasound, as an external source of energy, generates acoustic cavitation via fast formation, growth, and collapse of bubbles within the reaction fluid where localized high temperature and pressure can be attained (Mohammadi and Entezari, 2018 ). Photochemistry-based methods have also been exploited for the synthesis of nanometals (Xu et al., 2019 ). For instance, a taining hexadecyltrimethylammonium 43H2O) was irradiated with 254 nm ultraviolet light at room temperature for 30 min to generate Au nanorods; in the absence of Ag ions, spherical Au NPs were obtained. In contrast, when AgNO 3 is used, it served as a template to direct Au growth toward nanorod formation. During the reduction of HAuCl 43H2O to AuCl 4\u0000, AgNO 3 is oxidized to form AgBr or neutral clusters, which compete with photo-reduction of AuCl 4- to regulate the shape of the nanocrystal (Placido et al., 2009 ; Shajari et al., 2017 ). Thus, metal nanostructures can be fabricated across a range of temperatures, from ambient (20-25 C) to medium (30-100 C) to high (F100 C) temperature ranges (Anwar et al., 2019 ; V.V. T. Padil et al., 2018 ; Zare et al., 2019b ). Metal nano-compounds can be synthesized quickly, with well-controlled size and shape, by changing the mode of heating such as deployment of microwaves (Nadagouda and Varma, 2007 ). Table 1 represnts the gums for green synthesisi of metal-based nanoparticles 3.Drug delivery and tumor targeting In this section, the application of green-synthesized metal nano- structures in cancer diagnostics and therapy is highlighted. 3.1. Affecting factors Targeted nano- and microcarrier therapeutic agents are increasingly becoming top choices to combat diseases and other abnormalities (Battisti et al., 2019 ). Although several drug delivery systems for chemotherapy exist, (He et al., 2016 ; Keklikoglou et al., 2019 ; Y. Wang et al., 2017b ; Xin et al., 2016 ) one key principle is to use carriers that are capable of accumulating at tumor sites via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Natfji et al., 2017 ; Shah et al., 2018 ; Smith et al., 2012 ). The functionalization of nanoparticles is a promising way to achieve these goals, increase the therapeutic efficacy, and simulta - neously decrease the potential side effects (Brigger et al., 2012 ; Tonigold et al., 2018 ). Targeted cancer therapies can be divided into two main groups: passive and active. Passive targeting approaches may exploit specific characteristics that are different from non-cancerous environments, such as abnormally acidic and hypoxic conditions, immense and disor - ganized vascularization network, leaky vessels, insufficient lymphatic system, (Brigger et al., 2012 ; Morey and Pandit, 2018 ) and high inter- stitial pressure (e.g., the EPR effect) (Brigger et al., 2012 ). For example, nanoparticles (NO-NPs) release NO as vasodi - lator at tumor sites, which aids the passive targeting of therapeutics to localize the effect of NO at the tumor site; doxorubicin (DOX) was released at the desired site more effectively using this approach (Deep - agan et al., 2018 ). Active targeted therapy generally arises from the concept of ligand- receptor interactions. The overexpression of specific biomolecules, en- zymes and cell surface receptors (e.g., hyaluronidase, integrins, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (FR), epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), CD44) are widely observed in the tumor microenvironment, including tumor, endothelial, and surrounding stromal cells (Bar-Shavit et al., 2016 ; Day et al., 2017 ; Liang et al., 2019 ; Tashima, 2018 ; Xia et al., 2018 ). This strategy aims to attach specific ligands/bioactive molecules on the surface of NPs that have a high affinity toward overexpressed receptors on cancer or other cells. Nanometals and/or gum chains can be easily modified with hy- drophilic and eco-friendly polymers like polyethylene glycol (PEG) to increase their circulation stability and time in the blood stream, thereby improving the efficiency of the delivery system (Fig. 3) The metal sur- face can also be decorated with antibodies, biomolecules, peptides, and/ or DNA/RNA/siRNA, imprinted monosaccharide, molecularly imprin - ted polymers (MIPs) (Fig. 4) to provide targeting ability and specifically act on a particular site (Conde et al., 2012 ; Demir et al., 2018 ; Esfan - dyari-Manesh et al., 2016 ; Jin et al., 2017 ; Wang et al., 2016a ). These modifications using surface-decorated materials generally improve the efficiency of targeted delivery (Sharma et al., 2018 ), although there is high variability across time from injection through dissemination and clearance (Smith et al., 2013 ). For instance, folic acid (FA)-attached NPs can bind to the FR and enhance bioimaging or treatment process of the Table 1 Synthesis of metal nanoparticles mediated by gum polysaccharides.

Biotechnology Advances 48 (2021) 107711 5cancer cells (Fernandez et al., 2018 ). Attachment of FA to Au NPs via capping agents such as cysteamine (Khademi et al., 2019 ), KG (Kumar et ) or GG (Rajkumar and Prabaharan, 2020 ) has enabled better recognition of tumors by computed tomography due to improved tumor site-targeted accumulation of AuNPs (Devendiran et al., 2016 ; Kumar et al., 2018 ). As mentioned earlier, FA modified and cysteamine capped AuNPs were evaluated for tumor visualization and targeting ability. The ability to detect the tumor by computed tomography increased by 430%, thanks to higher X-ray attenuation by targeted AuNPs rather than pas- sive AuNPs, and tumor targeting efficacy grew by 200%, in comparison to passive targeting AuNPs (Khademi et al., 2019 ). Moreover, in the case of GG, the cell viability decreased by 35% when attached to FA (Raj- kumar and Prabaharan, 2020 ). Tumor tissues are generally hyperpermeable with leaky endothe - lium, allowing the enhanced extravasation and penetration of nanosized metals (Ahirwar et al., 2018 ; Shi et al., 2017 ; Smith et al., 2012 ; Smith et al., 2010 ). Various factors such as size, shape, surface charge, the chemistry of the material, hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance, and surface functional groups present on nanomaterials play important roles in the accumulation of nanomaterials to the tumor site (Smith and Gambhir, Fig. 3.Schematic illustration of the synthesis and functionalization of therapeutic agent encapsulated nanometals depicting tumor targeting strategy; conjugation with polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) improves the circulation time by stabilizing them against opsonization. Fig. 4.Tumor targeting by functionalization of gum polysaccharides and metal nanoparticles. P. Makvandi et al. Biotechnology Advances 48 (2021) 107711 62017; Zhu et al., 2019b). The pore size of blood vessels within tumors is highly variable and dependent upon multiple factors including cancer cell type, site of primary or metastatic tumor, as well as the stage of cancer progression. For instance, studies have suggested that the pores are ~7 nm in brain cancer vessels vs. ~1 nm in normal brain vessels; and pores are ~50-60 nm in a breast cancer model vs. ~5 nm in normal breast vessels (Chauhan and Jain, 2013; Smith et al., 2012). Accord - ingly, the NPs must be smaller than pores of the blood vessels to be able to extravasate (Peng et al., 2019; Shah et al., 2018). Aside from the size of NPs, their shape play a decisive role in their accumulation at the tumor site (Si et al., 2020; Siddiqui et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2012; Smith and Gambhir, 2017; Zhu et al., 2019b); NPs with a rod or discoidal geometries are assumed to have higher accumulation in target organs than NPs with a spherical shape of almost the same size (Zhu et al., 2019b). The architectural characteristics (size, shape) of NPs greatly influ- ence their internalization by cancer cells. The cell membrane may invaginate to internalize the particles, forming a vesicle of an average diameter 60-200 nm (Forte et al., 2016). A further decrease in the particle size does not necessarily lead to greater cell internalization directly (Kolesnick and Fuks, 2003). Interestingly, silica NPs of size 20 nm, exhibited higher cell toxicity than those of sizes 7 or 50 nm which may be primarily due to the optimal size of the NPs for cell uptake (Lu et al., 2011). Alternatively, the shape of metal NPs substantially affects the half- life, biodistribution, extravasation, and cellular uptake (Donahue et al., 2019). Rod shaped-particles show a higher contact angle with the cell surface, which translates to longer adhesion and more internaliza - tion compared to spherical particles (Zhu et al., 2019b). The type of nanometal, surface agents, and the appropriate geometry must be evaluated to achieve the desired in vivo localization and reach the intended therapeutic goal. As an example of non-spherical metal functionalization, gold nano- rods (GNRs) have garnered attention in cancer therapy because of their facile surface modification and conjugation in addition to advantageous optical properties (Mendes et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2016b; Zhang et al., 2016). Previously, KG-capped Au NPs were bound with FA and a fluo- rescent label fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) to improve the peutic and properties (Kumar et al., 2018); KG, an anionic polysaccharide, containing hydroxyl group facilitates the conjugation of FA via esterification reaction. Besides, this gum improves the loading capacity of hydrophobic therapeutics drugs, which can be trapped be- tween polymeric chains, on metal nanoparticles (Pathak and Malviya, 2020; Saranya et al., 2018; Thiele et al., 2011). In another example, FITC bound to KG generated the fluorescent labeled GNRs which show strong cellular attachment and uptake efficiency in cancerous cells with high FR expression (Kumar et al., 2018). Although gum chains can also be functionalized, but most of the previously studies have been devoted to the modification of nanometals and the deployed capping agents (Zare et al., 2019a). 3.2. Metal NPs/gum hybrid platforms as direct anticancer therapeutics Metal NPs can as al., Vlamidis and Voliani, 2018); platinum, silver, and gold NPs can induce the cancer cell death by various mechanisms and reduce the tumor size without support from anticancer drugs (El-Naggar et al., 2017; Farooq 2019; Meier-Menches et al., 2018; Tisato et al., 2019). For instance, Au NPs can induce cell death by elevating the reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing damage to DNA, activating caspase cascade of apoptosis, and interrupting the activity of mitochondria (Patil and Kim, 2017). Cytotoxic stabilized Au NPs (PDG-Au NPs) were reported in the cervical cancer cell line, HeLa (Islam et al., 2017); IC50 value of the PDG-Au NP-treated cells (2.14 g/mL) was close to that of the cisplatin (a standard anticancer drug)-treated group (1.89 g/mL). Silver NPs can undergo dynamic interactions with intracellular macromolecules (e.g. DNA and proteins) (Thornton et al., 2016) and active cellular internalization (Imai et al., 2017) to induce the cell death; nanosized Ag and intracellular molecules apparently produces ROS via in situ particle degradation. This process is facilitated by the acidic lysosomal media, eventually leading to apoptosis and necrosis. The various toxic activities of Ag NPs against cancer cell lines are related to higher metabolic rates of cells as well as their rate of cellular division (Jadhav et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2018; Vasanth et al., 2014). Benzoin gum water extract has been employed as a bioreductant in the synthesis of Ag NPs wherein both, human cervical and lung cancer cells have a greater sensitivity to the developed Ag NPs than that of non- cancerous cells. However, the cytotoxic responses were highly dose- dependent with maximum effectiveness at concentrations lower than 2 g/mL (Du et al., 2016). To understand the comparative impact of reducing agents on their anticancer properties in glioblastoma multi - forme cancer model, three sets of Ag NPs were synthesized employing sodium borohydride (NaBH 4), sodium citrate, and AG as reducing agents. Ag NPs synthesized using NaBH 4 were smallest (~20 nm) and showed higher cellular internalization and apoptosis; cell cycle tests showed a 2 fold increase in G2/M arrest in cancer cell group treated with Ag NPs compared to the not treated group(Liu et al., 2011). On the other hand, gum-mediated synthesis resulted in NPs of larger size (137 nm) that displayed lower cell penetration. Although gum-functionalized Ag NPs did not show optimal anticancer activity, they may have better overall biocompatibility due to the greener synthetic processes. How- ever, the effect of methodology and stabilizing agents with respect to biocompatibility should be compared by deploying the NP of compa - rable size and shape parameters. 3.3. Metal NPs/gum hybrid vehicles for drug delivery and chemotherapy Metal NPs are commonly used in drug delivery for cancer (S. Zhang et al., 2009b). Notably, conventional strategies for the administration of anticancer drugs (such as docetaxel (Cadete et al., 2019; Kulhari et al., 2016) and DOX(Pei et al., 2020)) suffer from higher side effects, shorter half-life in blood circulation, and low bioavailability (Feng et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2017; Mizumoto et al., 2019; Su et al., 2016), To overcome these obstacles, biogenic metal NPs could be utilized as drug carriers owing to their large surface area: volume ratios and intrinsic therapeutic properties (Zhou et al., 2018). They may carry payloads, by either conjugation or entrapment, to promote drug stability, enhance blood circulating time, and on-demand release by using stimuli-responsive systems (Jin et al., 2017). Noble metal NPs are widely used because of their optical properties, facile surface chemistry, and ease of function - alization (Conde et al., 2012; Jin et al., 2017). For instance, GeG stabilized Au NPs (GeG-Au NPs) were employed for the delivery of DOX to the cancerous cells (Dhar et al., 2008); anionic nature of the GeG allowed efficient loading capacity (close to 75%) of DOX on the NPs via intermolecular electrostatic interactions. In vitro studies revealed higher cytotoxicity on cancer cells in the DOX-loaded NP group than the group administered with free DOX. Nano - formulation was further modified with sophorolipid (SL) to produce DOX-loaded SL-conjugated GeG-Au NPs (DOX-SL-GeG-AuNPs) which demonstrated more efficacious anticancer cytotoxicity effects in 2 cell lines, human glioma LN-229 and HNGC-2, (human glioma stem cells) compared to the free DOX of A549 human lung adeno - carcinoma in tumor-bearing mice than the free drug (Pooja et al., 2015); GH-mediated induction of ROS was higher in the NP-treated group than the group treated with free drug alone. Phytochemicals such as resveratrol display anti-angiogenic, anti-in - flammatory, anticancer, antioxidant properties, as well as poor in vivo bioavailability due to fast degradation by the host's innate immune cells (Berman et al., 2017). In this context, AG-capped resveratrol- P. Makvandi et al. Biotechnology Advances 48 (2021) 107711 7conjugated Au NPs have been studied as potential nano- therapeutics in breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer (Thipe et al., 2019 ). In addition, these NPs can perform as suitable carriers for chemotherapeutic agents with poor pharmacokinetic properties such as curcumin to improve their stability and biodistributions (De Silva et al., 2019 ; Govindaraju et al., 2018 ) as exemplified by PEGylated- XG/Au nanocarriers recently deployed as delivery vehicles for curcumin (Fig. 5A). In vitro evaluations on murine melanoma showed that curcumin- loaded Au NPs had higher cell internalization rates than the free drug (Fig. 5B and C). Similarly, cancer cell viability in the group treated with the curcumin-decorated Au particles decreased by almost 10% and 90% compared to free curcumin and Au NPs curcumin, (Muddineti et al., 2016 ). 4.Radio-, photo- and magneto-therapy Tumor therapy using external stimulus, such as X-ray radiation, light, and magnetic fields, is a rapidly growing, exciting sub-field in oncology. The mechanisms for radiotherapy, photothermal, and photodynamic treatment as well as magnetic-mediated hyperthermia of tumors are depicted in Fig. 6. NPs have displayed good photothermal conversion efficiencies, often with preferred accumulation in tumors, and thus can be devised to enhance the radiation responses and over- come radiation resistance (Liu et al., 2019 ; G. Song et al., 2017a ). 4.1. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy is a method that generally involves the use of frac- tionated high doses of radiation to cause ionization of cellular water, generation of free radicals, and irreversible DNA double-stranded breaks and inflammation causing the damages to DNA of cancer cells beyond repair (De Ruysscher et al., 2019 ; Kolesnick and Fuks, 2003 ). Radiation therapy can be broadly classified into two groups, (i) external beam radiotherapy, and (ii) internal radiation therapy (also termed brachy - therapy). The former involves the direct exposure of affected site to the radiation by using an external machine. In the latter case, the source of radiation is implanted at the required site (Tanderup et al., 2017 ) and is often considered advantageous due to site specificity, reduction in off- target effects, and the improved protection of normal tissues (Tan- derup et al., 2017 ). Technological advancements have enabled the introduction of nanobrachytherapy, using radioactive metallic nanostructures, partic - ularly Au (radioactive isotopes) NPs; such injected nanoimplants may penetrate the tumor microenvironment through blood vessels and emit radiation locally to aid in therapeutic interventions (Gonzalez et al., 2020 ). For instance, 198Au has been used for brachytherapy as a radia - tion implant due to its great dose depth and reduced anisotropy; their relatively lower price (Dauffy et al., 2005 ; Kehwar, 2009 ) and short half- life makes it imperative to deliver the defined doses to cancerous tissue in a shorter duration. However, in this case heterogeneous dose distri - bution at the site of injection often limits efficacy (Butler et al., 1997 ). The use of gums as capping agents can partially address this limitation by stabilizing the NPs and preventing their aggregation as exemplified by (AG-198Au NPs) of diameter 85 nm; they effectively penetrated the tumor vasculature, thereby overcoming the aforementioned limitation and emit localized higher energy (Axiak-Bechtel et al., 2014 ). Targeted ultrasmall metal NPs as radiosensitizers emit secondary electrons enhancing the efficiency of radiation, reducing the hypoxia-induced resistance, and side effects; Fig. 5.(A) Preparation process loaded curcumin sol- in acetone are mixed. After rotary evapora - tion, water is added to curcumin/PVP and the mixture is centrifuged. The result is solid dispersion curcumin which will be later loaded and transferred to NPs. For synthesis of the NPs, starting from Au\u00873, ascorbic acid is added to tetrachloroaurate (III) hydrate (HAuCl 4 3H2O) reducing or over-growth of NPs, XG has been added previously as a stabilizer to make XG-Au NPs. Au NPs were also PEGylated (PX-Au NPs) to increase the half-life and stability.

Such accumulated nanocluster bombs con- taining tungsten oxide NPs (WO-NPs) undergo degradation via enzy- matic means; WO-NPs were a specific the CCL-28 chemokine (WOAC NPs) by MMP2-responsive WOACC NPs were accumulated in the tumor environment, the clusters were disso - ciated, due to the upregulation of MMP-2 enzyme at tumor site. Cluster hypoxia microenvironment-targeting WO NPs of ~5 nm in diameter which could penetrate deeply within the tumor and considering their photothermal conversion abilities, hypoxic tumor sites could be mapped with high precision. Moreover, the pro- duction of highly reactive radicals increased the radiation sensitivity leading to dramatically improved therapeutic efficiency in breast and pancreatic cancer cells. Using the combination of WOACC NP-assisted treatment with photothermal therapy (PTT) and radiotherapy (RT), the survival rate of tumor-bearing mice was extended to almost 100% compared to near 57% in PPT or NP-enhanced RT after one month. The WOACC NP-assisted treatment also prevented distant metastasis, which contributed to the high survival rate (Huo et al., 2017 ). 4.2. Phototherapy In contrast to radiotherapy, which inevitably involve some radiation exposure to normal tissues, (Taylor and Kirby, 2015 ) phototherapies such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and PTT are generally less harmful alternatives (Ban et al., 2017 ; Fan et al., 2016 ; Shen et al., 2018 ). However, a critical trade-off is that while radiotherapy can typically penetrate anywhere in the body, photonic-based therapies are generally limited by the penetration depth of the light used. 4.2.1. Photothermal therapy PTT employs photothermal agents at the tumor site to generate heat upon exposure to light, typically in the near-infrared (NIR) (700 -900 nm) spectrum. Sufficient increase in temperature of the local tumor microenvironment results in the death of cancer cells (Abadeer and Murphy, 2016 ; Singh et al., 2018 ). The intensity of the external NIR light can be adjusted to modulate the local temperature, thereby ensuring minimal damage to the surrounding healthy tissue (Gai et al., 2018 ). The non-invasive nature of this strategy has led to its appeal and enhanced the use in pre-clinical cancer therapies (Liu et al., 2019 ). Au NPs are often deployed due to their unique optical, photo - stability, and surface plasmon resonance characteristics (Dreaden et al., 2012 ). NPs were lung cancer (Gamal-Eldeen et al., 2017 ) which upon NIR irradiation (average power of 5 W), could significantly induce cell death in lung tumor tissue along with observable anti-inflammatory and anti- neovascular effects. Greener synthesis of biocompatible Au NPs was reported using cumin seeds and AG for PTT (Shalaby et al., 2015 ); cumin seeds and AG-stabilized Au NPs and prevented their aggregation in the presence of electrolytes. The study further demonstrated that HeLa cell viability was greatly influenced by the energy of the Nd:YAG laser (532 nm, 150 mW); Au NP-treated cells irradiated with the laser of varying energies, 7.6, 15.2, and 30.5 J/cm2, resulted in ~30, 50, and 60% cell death, respectively. In another study, drug delivery vehicles comprising a DOX-loaded AG-functionalized graphene-oxide shell with Au NPs core (AG-GO Au NPs) were developed (Fig. 7A) (Khan et al., 2017 ); a dual anticancer response was discerned that exploited both PTT and chemotherapy. Upon exposure to the NIR diode laser (808 nm, 1 W/ Fig. 6.Schematic (including photothermal and photody - namic therapy). (A) Under X-ray irradiation, NPs cause cancer tissues to generate free radicals. (B) Nanoparticles (e.g., Au nanorods) are exposed to laser or magnetic fields to generate heat, causing the tumor temperature to rise. (C) Exposure of nanoparticles to laser light causes a photochemical reaction, resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the tumor site. P. Makvandi et al. Biotechnology Advances 48 (2021) 107711 9cm2), AG-GO Au NPs showed significant reduction in the cell viability compared to the traditional Au NPs; cytotoxic effects were more pro- nounced in the DOX-loaded AG-GO Au NPs. Moreover, the photothermal effects (upon exposure to the laser) were enhanced in a manner that was highly-dependent on the composition of the NPs : Au NPs DAG-GO D AG-GO Au (Khan et al., 2017 ). 4.2.2. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) PDT involves the use of non-toxic photosensitizers (such as benzo - porphyrin derivatives, texaphyrins, and thiopurine derivatives), light of appropriate wavelength (typically 600-800 nm), and oxygen from the tissues (Agostinis et al., 2011 ; Kwiatkowski et al., 2018 ). These photo - sensitizers are administered to patients, followed by irradiation of the tumor site with a light source (Morton, 2002 ; Yoon et al., 2013 ). This initiates a photochemical reaction that results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the tumor site, leading to anticancer effects via one or more interrelated mechanisms (such as oxidative stress, damage to tumor vasculature, or induction of inflammatory re- sponses) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2018 ). Notably, unlike PTT, the mecha - nism of PDT highly depends on the availability of tissue oxygen (Kwiatkowski et al., 2018 ; Singh et al., 2018 ). A multi-layer GG-modi - fied multifunctional nanocomposite was designed to treat colorectal cancer (Kumar et al., 2019 ). The nanocomposite core is an upconversion material, the outer layer is a conjugated Rose Bengal with high quantum yield, its absorbance overlaps with the luminescence emission of the selected upconversion emitter. The combination of these two can ach- ieve efficient PDT activity. Also, the nanocomposite 's outermost layer of GG provides support to the mesoporous silica layer to store 5-FU to achieve drug release at the tumor site. The new nanocomposite enabled a dual-mode treatment involving both, the chemotherapy and PDT. Similarly, interventions involving metal NPs have been employed for dual-modal (PDT and PTT) (X. H. Wang et al., 2017a ) and tri-modal treatment (PDT, PTT, and chemotherapy) (Ma et al., 2018 ) strategies. However, the application of nanometal/gum polysaccharide hybrid biocomposite systems to PDT have not yet been reported, suggesting exciting new avenues for further clinical developments. 4.3. Magnetically-mediated hyperthermia Another effective strategy for anticancer therapy deploys magnetic NPs in combination with external magnetic fields (Liu et al., 2020 ; Minaei et al., 2019 ; Saifullah et al., 2020 ). Magnetic NPs such as iron oxide NPs (Fu et al., 2012 ) at the tumor site can be exposed to a magnetic field that results in an increase in the local temperature (up to 41-45 C) and can thereby cause cancer cell death (Nguyen et al., 2019 ; Sun et al., 2019 ; Suo et al., 2020 ). The effectiveness of this system is attributed to complex local heat transfer phenomena in vivo such that sufficient heat is produced by the magnetic particles to induce cell death (Kim et al., 2011 ; Liu et al., 2011 ). AG was used to biosynthesize targeted Fe3O4 NPs for the hyperthermia treatments under radiofrequency fields. Due to the presence of AG, the NPs displayed a hydrophilic nature which drove the formation of stable colloidal suspensions in aqueous media and physi - ological conditions (Horst et al., 2017 ). Here, it is important to note that Ag NPs can make cancer cells more sensitive to magnetic-nanoparticle- mediated thermo-induced killing. The reason lies in the high atomic number of silver and secondary radiation emission when radiated by radiofrequency wave (Liu et al., 2011, 2020 ; Horst et al., 2017 ). 5.Photoimaging and theranostic applications The decision to remove surgical margins at the tumor edge is often challenging for surgeons. Particularly in sensitive areas of the body, the removal of excessive tissue can damage important healthy tissues; conversely, minimizing the excavated region may allow sufficient tumor Fig. 7.(A) Fabrication of Arabic gum (AG) functionalized-graphene oxide/gold nanorods (AG- fGO-GNR) and loading doxorubicin (DOX). 20 nm.

In this regard, recent advances in photoimaging technology have been advantageous in distinguishing tumorous/cancerous zones from normal tissues. These technologies often involve the use of signal- generating NPs that specifically bind to the cancer cells and distin - guish them from normal cells upon incident stimuli (e.g., fluorescence, bioluminescence, chemiluminescence, phosphorescence) (Singh et al., 2018 ). The advantages of simultaneously delivering accurate therapy and diagnosis have led to a relatively new field called 'theranostics '. Applying theranostic strategies, often described for use in the cancer field, NPs can detect and report the presence of cancer cells while simultaneously inducing cytotoxic effects in the tumor. Theranostic agents may also track therapeutic efficacy and monitor the progression or reduction of the tumor during treatment (Barabadi et al., 2019 ; Feng and Liu, 2018 ; Kenry and Liu, 2019 ). These methods enable parallel imaging technologies alongside chemotherapy/phototherapy. Appro - priate use of theranostics to monitor treatment response provides the tantalizing potential to solve many obstacles in cancer therapy and di- agnostics (H. Kim et al., 2019a ). In a multifunctional design, FA-functionalized Au NPs with GG succinate (GGS) simultaneously showed positive results in diagnostic and cancer therapy. To produce targeted NPs, FITC-SiO 2 modified Au NPs were coated with L-cysteine methyl ester (LCME) by an Au-S bond followed by FA-conjugated GGS attachment to LCME via amide bond formation. The main reason of using GGS in this study was to provide FA conjugation on the surface of NPs; carboxyl group of GGS form an amide bond with the amine group of the LCME on the surface of Au NPs. In the final step, the methoxy group of LCME on the surface of NPs were eliminated to bind DOX. FA-conjugated GGS attached to the surface of Au NPs enhanced Au NP stability and tumor targeting during blood circulation. Furthermore, the NPs have been successful for the chemo/ photothermal therapy (PTT) and were suitable for the computed to- mography (CT)/fluorescence dual cancer imaging. The system comprised a combination of fluorescently labeled silica (FITC-SiO 2) core -gold shell NPs with DOX and FA ligands attached to the gum. The ensuing FITC-SiO 2@Au-DOX-GGS-FA NPs released the cargo in a pH- responsive manner. DOX release was increased by 80% in acidic pH versus physiological pH, because of the dissociation of hydrazone bond between DOX and LSME. The FA-targeted NPs with GGS showed higher toxic effects as compared to non-targeted NPs on cancer cells and reduced viability on HeLa cells by 35%. Due to the presence of a gold shell and FITC-SiO 2, the particles could be employed for both, the im- aging and PTT; FA-linked NPs were taken up by cancer cells over- expressing FR and showed efficient imaging via optical methods. In addition, the Au shell offered the ability to perform X-ray CT imaging. The NPs' stability in aqueous media substrates increased due to their negative surface charge (Fig. 8) (Rajkumar and Prabaharan, 2020 ). In general, modified NPs are not only attractive multimodal contrast agents but also excellent photothermal transduction agents (Li et al., 2020 ; Peng et al., 2017 ; X. Wang et al., 2016c ). To evaluate the photothermal efficacy of NPs, the temperature elevation was produced by 60 g/mL of NPs exposed to laser irradiation (532 nm, 1.2 W/cm2). After 5 minutes of laser irradiation, a 13 C temperature increase from physiological temperature was observed in NPs. Once a saturation temperature is reached, the NPs temperature did not increase further by continuing the irradiation. The in vitro study revealed efficient uptake of the NPs by HeLa cells. Post-internalization, the pH-responsive bonds between NPs hydrolyzed in the acidic endocytic compartment, spe- cifically releasing DOX into the cancer cells. The demonstrated ideal targeted drug release and PTT properties while being able to be traced by imaging, elevate the FITC-SiO 2@Au-DOX-GGS-FA NPs as 2)@ gold containing attached to acid (FA) with a GG succinate (GGS) core-shell nanoparticle structure. The FITC- SiO2@Au component is responsible for the imaging capability for diagnostics, with PTT as the therapeutic modality. FA on NPs attaches to FR on cancer cells, providing facilitated targeting and endocytosis. The bioresponsive NPs can also have chemotherapeutic effects, with DOX released as a chemotherapeutic agent. The release is pH-dependent due to a pH- sensitive bond between the drug and L-cysteine methyl ester (LCME). The bond will tend to break in the acidic tumor environment, leading to increased drug release (Rajkumar and Prabaharan, 2020 ). P. Makvandi et al. 107711 11candidates for chemotherapeutic/photothermal therapy (Rajkumar magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) with AG does improve their colloidal stability (Roque et al., 2009) as the pres- ence of many functional groups, e.g. carbonyl and amine, in the AG molecules, serve as capping agent (Iftekhar et al., 2018; Y. Wang et al., 2019c; Zha et al., 2019). Moreover, they facilitate the attachment of bioactive agents on the surface of the NPs (L. Zhang et al., 2009a). AG- Fe3O4 NPs were recently used in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, and fluo- rescence microscopy techniques to assess their accumulation/internali - zation in the right forebrain of a rodent brain tumor. The results showed 12-times greater cellular uptake of the MNPs by tumor cells in magnetically targeted rats with glioma tumors compared to normal contralateral brain tissue; MNPs displayed excellent stability in physi - ological conditions and high cellular internalization. The coupling of AG with Fe3O4 MNPs could provide a promising tool to achieve both, the imaging and magnetic drug delivery to many types of solid tumors in the brain (L. Zhang et al., 2009a). In another study, DOX was linked to MNPs via hydrazone bond to generate a multifunctional DOX-adipic dihydrazide-grafted AG-modified magnetic nanoparticles (DOX-ADH- AG-MNPs) exhibited a great potential for imaging and sensing (pH- sensitivity) (Banerjee and Chen, 2008). Optical and magnetic imaging was achieved using the fluorescence properties of the nanocomposites in the near-infrared (NIR) in addition to their magnetic nature; both intravital fluorescence microscopy and MRI can be employed (Fu et al., 2012; Nijdam et al., 2009). The NIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum allows relatively deep penetration of light in the tissue- translucent window without strong hyperthermic effects (Li et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2014, Smith et al., 2013; L. Song et al., 2017b). Under light excitation, both DOX and AG-MNPs displayed fluorescence and when coupled together as DOX-ADH-AG-MNPs, reversible self- quenching of fluorescence was observed upon light irradiation (Cham - bers et al., 2016; Di Stasio et al., 2017). Furthermore, the release of DOX from the NPs resulted in the recovery of fluorescence from both entities. This phenomenon was exploited in sensing to indicate cargo release from the MNPs (Chambers et al., 2016; Di Stasio et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2019a) as part of a drug release monitoring strategy. Finally, given the pH-sensitive nature of the hydrazone bond, the NP is highly selective for DOX release in acidic environments, and remains stable at neutral pH (Banerjee and Chen, 2008). Table 2 represents cancer therapy using nanometal/gum hybrid biocomposites. 6.Nanometals in immunotherapy Under normal physiological conditions, the immune system is designed to distinguish between abnormal cells and antigens from normal ones in order to attempt to destroy anomalous entities. Dendritic cells, extremely efficient antigen-presenting cells (APC), can capture, process, and present antigens to T cells through major histocompatibility complexes class I (MHC1) and class II (MHC2) molecules (Evans et al., 2018). Initially, T cells recognize the cancer cells based upon the pre- sented antigen and then cytotoxic compounds and chemicals are secreted into the recognized cells to induce cell apoptosis (Nitschke et al., 2017). However, to escape the immune response, some cancer cells overexpress immune checkpoint proteins such as programmed death-ligand (PD-L1) molecules on their surface to deactivate T cells and their functions, a so-called off-switch. In light of this, checkpoint in- hibitor drugs (e.g., anti-PD-L1 antibodies, and similar immunotherapies) are used to assist T cells to attain their cytotoxic prowess against tumor cells by blocking the checkpoint signal, known as on-switches (Fig. 9) (Hamilton and Sibson, 2013). These drugs thus enable T cells to recover their anticancer capabilities through T cell activation by APCs or prevent tumors from deactivating T-cells via pathways including programmed cell death-1 (PD-1, an immune checkpoint) and programmed cell death ligand (a PD-L1, an immune checkpoint inhibitor) (Hamilton and Sib- son, 2013). In the absence of a delivery vehicle support, the transport of peptide antigens to APCs is unable to generate significant immune responses due Table 2 Cancer therapy using nanometal/gum hybrid biocomposites.

Biotechnology Advances 48 (2021) 107711 12to the rapid degradation of the peptides during systemic circulation (Irvine and Dane, 2020 ). Thus, nanostructures including polymeric, liposomal, and metallic formulations that traffic to key immune tissues such as the spleen and lymph organs are promising candidates for the delivery of immunotherapeutic and immunoimaging agents (Evans et al., 2018 ; Irvine and Dane, 2020 ; P. Wang et al., 2020b ). Furthermore, metallic NPs are intrinsically endowed with immunogenic features to act as an adjuvant to help assist in promoting strong immune responses (Almeida et al., 2015 ). Metal-based nanomaterials are also outstanding candidates to enhance immune function by using magnetic fields to remotely activate T cells during adaptive T cell therapy (Fig. 10). In this study, a magnetic field is applied as an external stimulus to drive ag- gregation of functionalized paramagnetic nanoparticles on the T cell surface, leading to activation (Perica et al., 2014 ). However, a major limitation post-therapy, is that tumor repopulation may recur (Huang et al., 2011 ). Immunotherapy has rapidly become an important tool in the cancer arsenal, so gum-metal nanoparticles are being developed in this vein. Bergenin-encapsulated silver nanoparticles, using gum xantham as a stabilizer, showed synergistic inhibition of toll like receptor (TLR) (2 and 4) mRNA expression and cytokine production (TNF- , IL-1 and IL- 6) in arthritic rats. While relatively few immunotherapy studies on gum- metal nanoparticles currently exist, they are accelerating and there is increasing interest in how these natural materials-based nanoparticles interact with the immune system in order to efficiently translate these nanosystems into the clinic (Rao et al., 2018 ). 7.Conclusion and outlook A wide variety of efforts are underway to combat cancer, a primary global cause of death at 330.8 per 100,000 population on average from 2012 to 2016 (Siegel et al., 2019 ) and a death toll of 9.6 million worldwide just in 2018. Gum polysaccharides and their nanocomposites containing nanosized materials are highly biocompatible and display excellent potential to support cancer imaging and therapy. The materials comprising these nanocomposites are readily available, eco-friendly, display advantageous physico-chemical properties and embrace the \"green chemistry \" methodology that paves the pathway towards safer fabrication processes and future clinical applications. Exudate gums, for instance, gum tragacanth, and gum karaya, as the oldest natural gums have been explored intensely for the synthesis of assorted MNPs and have been applied broadly in tissue engineering, packaging, textile, and biomedicine. Despite their wide range of applications, the shortcomings of natural gums have also increasingly been highlighted: for instance, anisotropic particle formulation is perhaps the major drawback of these eco-friendly methods. It is therefore important to accurately identify the component(s) of plant extract that is responsible for particle stabiliza - tion and reduction. Understanding of toxicity and safety associated with phytochemical- based nanoparticles remains somewhat limited. So further clinical studies are warranted to identify potential hazards associated with these nanomaterials. This is a pivotal factor for clinical translational appli - cations. Nevertheless, given their currently known safety profiles for a range of such entities, these nanohybrids provide a ray of hope for future cancer diagnosis and therapeutic appliances. In addition, despite the increasing application of nanomedicine in oncology, there is still a lack of recognized regulatory standards in the field of nanomedicine (Hala- moda-Kenzaoui et al., 2019 ). Even small changes in raw materials or small modifications in manufacturing processes could significantly alter the biological properties and biological distribution of nanomaterials (Duncan and Gaspar, 2011 ). This makes it difficult for the experts to agree on the regulatory standards for nanomedicine (Duncan and Gas- par, 2011 ). Therefore, this review does not discuss in depth the regu- lation of nanomedicine. Optical methods often deploy various metal-based nanomaterials as they are capable of generating strong plasmonic resonance upon the Fig. 9.The programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor is expressed on the surface of activated T cells. The respective ligands, such as programmed cell death ligand-1 and -2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2), are expressed on the surface of immune cells. PD-1 and PD-L1/PD-L2 belong to a family of immune checkpoint proteins that act as co- inhibitory factors that can limit the development of the T cell response. The PD-1/PD-L1 interaction is designed to ensure that the immune system is activated at the appropriate time to minimize the possibility of chronic autoimmune inflammation.

Among different nano- metals, indeed, a substantial proportion of research and commercial investment is dedicated to gold-based nanomaterials, especially non- spherical particles such as rod-shaped NPs, owing to their high con- version of light energy for phototherapy (Zhu et al., 2019c ). Due to the inherent nature of cancer, several techniques have been explored to elevate the efficacy of diagnosis/therapy systems and, at the same time, diminish their side effects in the patient. Instead of delivering therapeutic agents throughout the body, it would be more effective to take the advantage of non-physiological characteristics of tumor tissues to guide and confine the cargo only where needed (Yang et al., 2013 ). However, there remain a number of barriers in preclinical and poten - tially clinical in vivo applications of metal-based nanocompounds. Among them, one big hurdle may be the lack of recognized regulatory standards mentioned above. Besides, the biocompatibility, in vivo ki- netics, efficacy and ability in tumor targeting, acute and chronic toxicity, and capability to escape the reticuloendothelial system are among these limitations (RES) (Balakrishnan et al., 2017 ; Dey Bhowmik et al., 2019 ; Haume et al., 2016 ). A reasonable strategy would be to reduce the cytotoxicity of metal nanoparticles via their functionaliza - tion/coating with biomolecules such as amino acids, proteins, and essential oils as well as plant-based polysaccharides, e.g. hyaluronic acid, starch, and TG. Other natural bioactive molecules, e.g. active metabolites such as curcumin, thymol, and carvacrol, can be employed (Moeini et al., 2020 ). Although, surface functionalization of nanometals, gums and their polymer nanocomposites can also be modified with bioactive molecules for targeted delivery, this strategy on metal Fig. 10.Schematic illustration for T cell activation in the presence of a magnetic field. The surface of paramagnetic iron oxide NPs was modified for immunotherapy. Reprinted with modification from (Perica et al., 2014 ). P. Makvandi et al.
