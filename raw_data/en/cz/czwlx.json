You can read the full lawsuit here (in Italian). The gist is this: Iorio accused Ciufolini of criticizing the work of other physicists on ArXiv.org under two separate pseudonyms (in a letter which the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, which published his claims, later retracted, saying it was a matter better handled locally). Iorio later left critical comments on articles about Ciufolini on the Science blog,Neuroskeptic, and an Italian newspaper La Repubblica's website. Kelly Wiggins and Christopher Bielawski share authorship on all the papers in question. After the first set of EoCs, Bielawski, at the time a PI at UT Austin, told Chemistry and Engineering News that a \"former lab member\" had admitted to faking the data. The recent retraction indicates that University of Texas at Austin's Office of Research Integrity formally investigated the lab, and determined that Bielawski was telling the truth about a former lab member being to blame. Bielawski has since taken a post at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea. He told us that move was unrelated to anything that happened at UT Austin, but declined to answer other questions. Wiggins got a postdoc at the University of Illinois, which an Illinois spokesperson confirmed lasted from July 1 2013 to January 22 2014; we're waiting to hear back on our question about whether her departure had anything to do with misconduct. Less than three months after publishing a paper in Science which they claim to have been able to detect the spin of a single proton, the authors have retracted it for \"a potentially serious issue with the main conclusion.\" Two solar cell researchers at the University of New South Wales have lost a paper in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews after the discovery of \"substantial overlap\" with work by a UNSW graduate student. The notice cites three sources for the plagiarism. One is an unpublished manuscript by UNSW student Matthew Wright, which he shared with the authors of the retracted paper for \"research collaboration only.\" The other two are papers that Wright wrote with UNSW professor Ashraf Uddin, who co-authored the retracted paper with UNSW researcher Xiaohan Yang. Yang's name also appears on one of the plagiarized papers. All of that suggests that the \"substantial overlap\" includes duplication as well as plagiarism. According to Wright's Google Scholar profile, Uddin has been a co-author on every one of his papers, suggesting that Uddin is Wright's thesis advisor or P.I., though neither Wright nor Uddin responded to our emailed questions. A group of Chinese cardiologists at Capital Medical University have done a quick ewe-turn, pulling a paper after mixing up both the author order and wrongly reporting how many sheep were killed in the making of this experiment. An economist at Takming University of Science and Technology in Taiwan recently posted a preprint attempting to refute anonymous accusations that he repeated himself in critical reviews of textbooks. From what we understand running the paper (originally in Chinese) through Google Translate, the reviews were published in Takming University's in-house journal, Deming Journal. The editorial board received an anonymous letter on November 3 accusing Jen-Chang Liu of duplicating \u2014 aka self-plagiarizing \u2014 three of the reviews. The editorial board provided Liu with the documents, and together with another Takming professor, Mark Yeats, he wrote a refutation of each of the accusations. It was published on December 20 on Social Science Research Network, a preprint repository for academic works. At the time, we mentioned two other articles, in the Hydrogeology Journal, that appeared destined for retraction \u2014 not least because KU requested that the journal yank them. But in a rather surprising move, the journal is declining to do so, and another publication, the Journal of Hydrology, is taking the same approach. "}
