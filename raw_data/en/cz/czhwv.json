Based on your condition, we will estimate the number of sessions that may be needed to implement the therapy plan and inform you during the initial consultation. You can pay per session as you go or buy packages at a discounted rate according to the chart listed above. The reason the sessions are at a lower rate is not that you buy more of them, rather it gives us an opportunity to plan and structure your in one shot. That saves us time and in turn, we can reduce the cost of the sessions. GIFT CERTIFICATES ARE AVAILABLE, please call 828-774-5150. Terms & Conditions To change an appointment without penalty, we need at least 24 hours notice. Otherwise, there will be a $30 fee. Due to the work involved in assessing the health condition of the client and tailoring a therapy plan for the duration of the purchased package, the discounted packages are non-refundable, non-transferable, and non-exchangeable. Discounted packages must be used in full within a year from the date of the purchase. It is imperative to realize that our therapies require client participation and their effectiveness is proportional to that participation. "}
