New Mexico State University aces.nmsu.edu Pasture: only major source of internal parasites. Parasitology Basics Internal parasites Stomach worms, intestinal worms The gastrointestinal tract of cattle is often infected with internal parasites Infected cattle pass eggs in manure onto the ground; Eggs hatch in the manure ; Rain washes the larvae from the manure ; larvae migrate into soil Cattle swallow larvae migrating up on wet grass once soil moisture and temperatures reach optimal levels All About Discovery! New Mexico State University aces.nmsu.edu Parasitology Basics The worms mature in about 3 weeks and lay eggs. In June, July and August, larval development of the brown stomach worm, the most common and harmful of the internal parasites, is inhibited in the stomach lining. The worms are usually transmitted when soil temperatures are 55\u00b0F to 85\u00b0F in rainy periods in late summer (July, August) and early fall (Sep- Oct). Pasture larvae hibernate in winter (November through March) and sometimes in the summer (May -June). All About Discovery! New Mexico State University aces.nmsu.edu Parasitology Basics Lung worms Lung worms cause a lung disease in cattle with clinical signs similar to those caused by viruses, bacteria and allergies. Transmission and control are the same as for other internal parasites. Lung worm disease occurs in previously unexposed cattle, such as in calves or na\u00efve cattle moved into lungworm infested pasture. All About Discovery! New Mexico State University aces.nmsu.edu Parasitology Basics Calves have low immunity and usually become wormy during their exposures. Heavy exposures cause disease; light exposures produce immunity. Adult cattle and young cattle have immunity from previous exposures, but often become wormy when: Nutrition is inadequate and their immunity has lowered; Brown stomach worm larvae have emerged from the stomach lining in mid -late summer; and Heavy exposures have occurred. All About Discovery! New Mexico State University aces.nmsu.edu Parasitology Basics Clinical signs of wormy cattle include pale mucous membranes, bottle jaw, pot belly, diarrhea, drawn up, not grazing, not chewing cud, rough and dry haircoat, thinness, weakness and inability to stand. Anorexia Most of the clinical signs are the same as malnutrition (hypoproteinemia) When cattle have a diet with enough protein, vitamins and minerals, fewer worms are normally established and the cattle are more able to withstand their effects. All About Discovery! New Mexico State University aces.nmsu.edu Parasitology Basics The effects of internal parasite infection can be long lasting Na\u00efve cattle may become clinically parasitized, but most parasite infections are sub -clinical Decreased protein absorption, immune system depression, decreased weight gains, increased disease susceptibility, increased morbidity and mortality, and decreased response to vaccinations are all common with sub- clinical infections All About Discovery! New Mexico State University aces.nmsu.edu Parasitology Basics GI nematode infections may cause profound shifts in subpopulations of T lymphocytes, with a shift towards cells which mediate humoral immunity and away from cells which mediate cellular immune responses. This is important in the immune response to both viral infection and vaccination response This can have a negative effect on performance throughout the feeding period and on carcass quality All About Discovery! New Mexico State University aces.nmsu.edu Parasitology Basics Deworming Strategy A strategic method requires proper timing. This means that a drug against a parasite must be administered at the right time considering the parasite's biology. Therefore, the correct time is not when the cattle are confined and accessible, or because it has been a long time since the cattle received a drug, or because administrations are spaced evenly (fall and spring, every 6 months). The correct time is when cattle have become infected, the parasite is beginning to develop and cause damage, and conditions are best for transmission All About Discovery! New Mexico State University aces.nmsu.edu Parasitology Basics Administering a drug at the right time breaks the life cycle of the worms and prevents them from building up in cattle. The right time to administer cattle wormers normally depends on the parasite and the development of optimal environmental conditions, which include moderate temperatures, rainfall and wet grass. For stomach worms, administer drugs 3 to 6 weeks after optimal environmental conditions develop. This may not be possible in our big, low density stocked pastures All About Discovery!
