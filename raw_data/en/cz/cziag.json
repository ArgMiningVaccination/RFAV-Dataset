Under the terms of the agreement, BARDA will fund the advancement of mRNA-1273 to FDA licensure. A Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 is being conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Phase 1 open-label study, which began on March 16, 2020 has completed enrollment of the original study: 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years in three dose cohorts (25 \u00b5g, 100 \u00b5g and 250 \u00b5g). The NIH recently amended the Phase 1 protocol to include an additional six cohorts: three cohorts of older adults (ages 56 -70) and three cohorts of elderly adults (age 71 and above). Enrollment for these cohorts is ongoing. If supported by safety data from the Phase 1 study, the Company intends to begin a Phase 2 study of mRNA-1273 under its own Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the second quarter of 2020. Subject to data from these studies and discussions with regulators, a Phase 3 study could begin as soon as fall, 2020. BARDA funding will support these late-stage clinical development programs, as well as the scale-up of mRNA-1273 manufacture in 2020 to enable potential pandemic response. To support the scale-up, Moderna plans to hire up to 150 new team members in the U.S. this year. This includes a significant increase in its skilled manufacturing staff to expand manufacturing capacity from two shifts per day, 5 days per week to three shifts per day, 7 days per week, engineers to manage process scale-up, and clinical and regulatory staff to support clinical development. \"We are thankful for BARDA's support to fund the accelerated development of mRNA-1273, our vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2,\" said St\u00e9phane Bancel, Moderna's Chief Executive Officer. \"Time is of the essence to provide a vaccine against this pandemic virus. By investing now in our manufacturing process scale-up to enable large scale production for pandemic response, we believe that we would be able to supply millions of doses per month in 2020 and with further investments, tens of millions per month in 2021, if the vaccine candidate is successful in the clinic.\" \"Vaccines are a critical tool for saving lives and stopping the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,\" said BARDA Director Rick Bright, Ph.D. \"Delivering a safe and effective vaccine for a rapidly spreading virus requires accelerated action. BARDA's goal is to have vaccine available as quickly as possible and preparing now for advanced stage clinical trials and production scale-up while the Phase 1 is underway could shave months off development of COVID-19 vaccines.\" Conference Call and Webcast Information Moderna will host a live conference call and webcast at 8:00 a.m. ET on Friday, April 17, 2020.

About mRNA-1273 mRNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was selected by Moderna in collaboration with investigators from Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the NIH. The first clinical batch, which was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing; it was shipped to NIH on February 24, 42 days from sequence selection. The first participant in the NIH-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was dosed on March 16, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing.

About Moderna's Prophylactic scientists designed the Company's prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent infectious diseases. More than 1,400 participants have been enrolled in Moderna's infectious disease vaccine clinical studies under health authorities in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Clinical data demonstrate that Moderna's proprietary vaccine technology has been generally well-tolerated and can elicit durable immune responses to viral antigens. Based on clinical experience across six Phase 1 studies, the Company designated prophylactic vaccines a core modality and is working to accelerate the development of its vaccine pipeline. The potential advantages of an mRNA approach to prophylactic vaccines include the ability to combine multiple mRNAs into a single vaccine, rapid discovery to respond to emerging pandemic threats and manufacturing agility derived from the platform nature of mRNA vaccine design and production. Moderna has built a fully integrated manufacturing plant which enables the promise of the technology platform. Moderna currently has [nine development candidates](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.modernatx.com%2Fprogram-detail&esheet=52205192&newsitemid=20200416005985&lan=en-US&anchor=nine+development+candidates&index=4&md5=f92a5d96fd50f753f4d68f59dbb7c4e7) in its prophylactic vaccines modality, including: Vaccines against respiratory infections - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults (mRNA-1777 and mRNA-1172 or V172 with Merck) - RSV vaccine for young children (mRNA-1345) - Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus type vaccine coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (mRNA-1273) - Influenza H7N9 (mRNA-1851) Vaccines against infections transmitted from mother to baby - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine (mRNA-1647) - Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893 with BARDA) Vaccines against highly prevalent viral infections - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccine (mRNA-1189) To date, Moderna has demonstrated positive Phase 1 data readouts for in Phase 2 dose-confirmation study. Moderna's investigational Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893), currently in a Phase 1 study, was granted FDA Fast Track designation in August 2019.
