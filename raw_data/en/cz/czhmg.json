In Chinese medicine, Qi is the vital energy that helps regulate the body and keep it functioning normally. Any disruptions in the Qi are primarily seen as the source of physical and mental health issues including common ailments like the flu, fever, cough, depression and anxiety. We spoke to two Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners\u2014Gianna Buonocore from [Integrated Medicine Institute](https://www.imi.com.hk) and Cecilia Cheung from [Health Wise\u2014](https://www.chinesemed.hk)for advice on which herbs to add to your diet to help boost your immune system and improve your wellbeing. 1. Astragalus Root The most commonly suggested ingredient by the two experts to add to your routine to boost your immunity is the Astragalus Root\u2014or Huang Qi\u2014as known in Chinese. The root is a principle herb used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for increasing an individual's vitality and promotes immune boosting compounds. Astragalus Root is typically combined with Atractylodes Rhizome (Bai Zhu) and Ledebouriella Root (Feng Feng) to create a soup. According to Cheung, this soup is like \"building a 'defensive wall' to protect your body\" from cold and flu and is \"generally good for everyone\" at all stages of life. "}
