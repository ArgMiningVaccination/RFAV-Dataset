[Vox](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/24/16019590/hiv-vaccine-international-aids-society-conference): There's a promising new HIV vaccine candidate in the pipeline \"...The mosaic vaccine was developed using a computer algorithm to analyze HIV data from around the world and select a range of HIV sequences to include in a shot. It's called a 'mosaic' because it involves taking pieces of different viruses and sticking them together to generate immune responses that can cover a broad range of HIV subtypes. ... A word of caution, though: We're only in the early phase of human testing, and the vaccine could ultimately fail to prevent the virus from spreading among people...\" (Belluz, 7/24).
