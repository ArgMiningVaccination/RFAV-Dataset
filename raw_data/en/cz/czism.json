But, did you know that Drinking hot tea has been used as a health-boosting practice in cultures across the globe for centuries? A [ study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055352/) about tea and health has confirmed the health benefits of drinking tea. In general, tea drinkers were found to have lower rates of cancer and heart disease. But besides boosting overall [ health](/articles/drinking-tea-may-improve-brain-health), different types of tea are particularly effective at easing headaches. No matter if the headache is caused by allergies or tension, tea can act as a helpful natural remedy. Green Tea People have enjoyed the health benefits of green tea for thousands of years. A popular element in [ traditional Chinese](/articles/7-best-kept-healthy-habits-from-far-east?fbclid=IwAR1-L3BXay0qYrvGp0e-jCbm-npuQTLqJNJ3mR7bwWNU3OQ8diJpYWeUpBk) and Indian medicine, a [ study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5655397/) published in the Journal of Headache Pain found that the caffeine in green tea acts as a mood booster and alertness enhancer for drinkers. According to the researchers, caffeine may help \"influence improvement in headache symptoms.\" For a headache triggered by stress or sleep deprivation, a glass of [green tea](/articles/9-teas-to-suit-your-every-mood) may be helpful. Willow Bark Tea As you may have guessed from its name, willow bark tea is derived from the bark of the common willow tree. It is sold in some health stores as nature's aspirin for its analgesic and pain-relieving properties according to [ Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/willow-bark-natures-aspirin). While widely known as a folk remedy, clinical studies on willow bark tea's effectiveness have been limited. A [ study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21226125/) published in the journal Phytotherapy Research found that drinking willow bark tea is stronger pain reliever than that of aspirin, and unlike aspirin, does not have negative effects on the gastrointestinal tract.
