Tips for better sleep Getting into a good sleep pattern may take weeks. You can do it by making small changes at a time. How to change your sleep habits gradually It can be hard to change habits. Old routines are familiar and take less effort. Wanting to change is a good start but the change needs to be realistic for a new habit to stick. Start by making 1 small, manageable change. For example, you could: - set an alarm to start winding down and get ready for bed - write a to-do list for the next day - go for a brisk walk during the day - avoid drinking coffee in the afternoon When you can do the new habit without thinking, add other changes to your sleep routine. Stick to a sleep routine To help your body clock get into a rhythm: - get up at the same time - go outside and get light exposure during the day - go to bed at the same time Most adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep. By working out what time you need to wake up, you can set a regular bedtime schedule. Keep the same routine at weekends too. Sleeping in can disrupt your sleep pattern. Avoid naps during the day. Napping can make it harder to fall asleep at night. Avoid substances that disrupt sleep Avoid or cut down on things that keep you awake and affect sleep quality. Nicotine The nicotine in cigarettes is a stimulant. People who smoke take longer to fall asleep, wake up more often and have more disrupted sleep. Alcohol Alcohol may help you to fall asleep, but it harms the quality of your sleep and can wake you up in the night. If you have disrupted sleep, avoid drinking alcohol in the evenings. Caffeine Caffeine can make it difficult to fall asleep and it can prevent deep sleep. Drinks with caffeine in them include tea, coffee, energy drinks or soft drinks. Foods can also contain caffeine, such as chocolate and some protein bars. Caffeine affects people in different ways. If you have trouble sleeping, avoid caffeine 4 to 6 hours before bed. Instead of using caffeine you can try: - going for a short walk if you feel sleepy after lunch - switching to caffeine-free drinks such as water or fruit juices in the afternoon Large meals Too much food at night can cause sleep problems. Try not to eat a large meal 3 to 4 hours before bed. Relax before bed Winding down is an important stage in preparing for bed. It helps you to relax and gets your body ready for sleep. Create a wind-down routine that works for you. To wind down, you could: - do gentle stretches to relax your muscles, such as gentle yoga - listen to relaxing sounds, for example, guided relaxation or calming music - do deep breathing exercises or meditation - have a warm bath to help your body reach a temperature that's ideal for rest - put your phone away - it's easy to spend more time on it than you intended Bright light from screens can affect your body clock. Limit your use of electronic devices in the hour before bed. Calm a racing mind Many people lie in bed going over the day in their minds and thinking about everything they have to do the next day. This makes it harder to fall asleep. To calm a racing mind before bed, you could try to: - make time to plan for the next day, such as writing a to-do list - let go of any difficult thoughts and feelings from the day \u2014 write them down or talk about them - read a book or listen to a relaxing podcast - try [mindfulness](https://www2.hse.ie/mental-health/self-help/activities/mindfulness/) Talk to your GP if: - you have problems falling asleep that last for more than 4 weeks They may suggest you do some cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). This can help change thoughts and behaviours that stop you from sleeping. Create a restful place to sleep Try to have a relaxing space for sleeping. You could: - make sure the room is not too hot or too cold - keep the space dark - sleep with as little light as possible, use curtains or an eye mask if you need to - use earplugs to block out noise - avoid using a TV or electronic devices - keep pets out if they disturb your sleep - put a few drops of lavender oil on your pillow - the smell can help you relax - put away any work-related devices when you finish for the day if you have to work from your bedroom It's difficult to get restful sleep on a mattress that's too soft or too hard. Or on a bed that's too small or old. Replace uncomfortable mattresses or beds if you can. Get up if you cannot sleep If you cannot sleep, get up and do something you find relaxing. But keep the light levels low. When you feel sleepy again, go back to bed. Avoid looking at a clock or checking the time often. This can cause stress and make it harder to sleep. Keep active Regular physical activity is a great way to improve your sleep and help you fall asleep faster. To get the most benefit, do at least 30 minutes of moderate activity 5 days a week. Moderate activities make your heart beat faster than normal and your breathing harder than normal. An example of a moderate activity is brisk walking. But even walking a bit more than usual during the day can improve your sleep. Avoid vigorous exercise in the hour before you go to bed. For example, running. It can make it harder to fall asleep. Avoid staying up late for 'me time' Many people stay up late to get back some 'me time'. But this can disrupt your sleep routine. Think of sleep as 'me time' too. You need it to restore your energy and feel good during the day. Try to make some time for yourself during the day, such as taking a short walk or phoning a friend for a chat. If finding time is difficult, try to: - focus on priorities and spread out other tasks over the week - give yourself permission to say 'no' to things that are not a priority - delegate or ask for help with some tasks Keep a sleep diary A daily sleep diary can help you to find out why you can't sleep. For example, lifestyle habits, activities, medicines or stress. Take a few minutes to note: - the time you go to bed and wake up - how long it takes you to fall asleep - how often you wake during the night - when you feel tired during the day - how much alcohol, caffeinated drinks or tobacco you have and when - how much exercise you do and when - if you took any medicines If you see your GP or a sleep specialist, they may ask you to keep a sleep diary to help them diagnose your sleep problems.
