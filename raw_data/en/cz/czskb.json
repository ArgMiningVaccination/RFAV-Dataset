For more information on safely preparing formula, please visit [www.babyfriendlynl.ca](http://www.babyfriendlynl.ca/). Wash your hands before and after contact with the child with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub. This includes before preparing feeds and before feeding or holding the baby. Holding your baby skin-to-skin helps your baby to thrive. Hold your baby while feeding and follow their feeding cues; feed your baby when they are hungry and stop when they are full. Any person with COVID-19 or with [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.gov.nl.ca/covid-19/public-health-guidance/covid-19/symptoms/) who is feeding or holding the infant should wear a mask and clean and disinfect high touch surfaces often. Wash and disinfect formula preparation equipment and feeding supplies carefully after each use. Mixed feeding If a parent/caregiver is mixed feeding (i.e., breastfeeding and formula feeding) they may wish to breastfeed more often to increase their breast milk supply and reduce their reliance on formula. If a parent/caregiver recently stopped breastfeeding, it may be possible for them to restart. Bottles and nipples may be more difficult to clean. Try using a spoon or cup to feed non-human milk. To learn how to cup feed, visit this [website](https://breastfeeding.support/cup-feeding-newborn/). Are you concerned about the availability of infant formula? In Canada, there is currently no shortage of infant formula. In some cases, a parent/caregiver may have difficulty accessing infant formula in rural or remote communities or parents/caregivers may have reduced access to buy infant formula. If a parent/caregiver is having trouble accessing infant formula, they can: - Aim to have enough non-human milk on hand to last for 14 days (two weeks). - Buy it online from a store or the manufacturer. - Switch to a different brand or type of formula (ready-to-feed, liquid concentrate or powder). Any formula labelled for use from birth is safe for baby, unless baby is on a special formula. If this is the case, contact a health care provider to discuss - Reach out to friends or family who may have formula to lend until supplies are available. - Contact a local food bank as they may have formula available or provide guidance on how you may be able to access it. If you are sick with COVID-19 symptoms and staying home, ask friends or relatives who are well to deliver infant formula to the home and anything else the family needs. Considerations Health Canada does not recommend the use of homemade infant formulas (including those made with canned evaporated milk) due to the danger of them being nutritionally incomplete and harmful to the baby. Formula should not be diluted with extra water to make the supply last longer, as this is unsafe for baby. Cow milk should not be introduced unless baby is 9-12 months old and is eating a variety of iron-rich foods two or more times each day. Iron-rich foods include beef, poultry, wild game, fish, eggs, beans, lentils, tofu, nut butters and iron-fortified infant cereals. If baby is not regularly eating a variety of iron-rich foods, the parent/caregiver should wait before introducing cow milk. When introduced, only whole (3.25% M.F.) cow milk should be used. COVID-19 can be stressful for people. You may be experiencing uncertainty, worry and stress about the health and safety of your loved ones and how COVID-19 may disrupt your lives.
