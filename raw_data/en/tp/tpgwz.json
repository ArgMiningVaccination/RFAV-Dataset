We describe a case of severe rhabdomyolysis temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in an adolescent. What is known and what is new? This previously well 16-year-old female developed myalgia at 36 hours post-BNT162b2_V vaccine and by 60 hours post-vaccine developed dark tea-colored urine triggering presentation to our emergency room. The patient had a brief hospitalization for intravenous hyperhydration. At follow-up, this patient's strength continued to improve and returned to baseline. What is the implication, and what should change now? While causality cannot be assigned to such single event, reporting of adverse events following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is important to ensure continued post-licensure surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines. The benefits of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in reducing hospitalizations and death, however, continue to outweigh any potential risk of rare adverse events. Introduction Rhabdomyolysis is a known complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection ( [1](#B1)) and has been reported following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in adults ( [2](#B2)- [5](#B5)). In North America, vaccination of adults and adolescents 16 years and older began in December 2020 ( [6](#B6)). In May 2021, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (BNT162b2_V) was approved for use in adolescents 12-15 years old. Since its roll-out, concern has been raised about reports of myocarditis following the vaccine in the adolescent population ( [6](#B6)). To our knowledge, there are no published reports of myositis or severe rhabdomyolysis following BNT162b2_V in the pediatric population. We present this rare and potentially serious event following receipt of BNT162b2_V in accordance with the CARE reporting checklist (available at [https://pm.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/pm-22-18/rc](https://pm.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/pm-22-18/rc)). Case presentation A previously healthy 16-year-old female developed fevers peaking at 40 and fatigue within 9 hours of receiving the second dose of the BNT162b2_V ( [Figure 1](#figure1)), timed 28 days after an event-free first dose. Fevers settled within 24 hours and were followed at 36 hours post-BNT162b2_V by the onset of diffuse myalgia severe enough to limit motor activity disproportionately in proximal more than the distal limb muscles. Soreness along with nonpruritic erythematous macular rash were noted on the arm that BNT162b2_V was administered. Sixty hours post-vaccine, dark red, tea-colored urine was noted which triggered initial emergency room visit. There were no associated cardio-respiratory symptoms and no known past SARS-CoV2 infection. She had not travelled or had sick contacts and had no medications beyond Clindamycin-Tretinoin topical gel, herbal supplements, precipitating trauma, rigorous exercise, or recreational drug ingestion. At admission to our hospital (5 days post-vaccination), a detailed assessment revealed that the injection site was warm and mildly tender without any palpable nodules, induration or fluctuance. There was ipsilateral reactive axillary lymphadenopathy. Neck muscles and proximal limb muscles were mildly tender causing pain at full range of proximal muscle activity, limiting proximal strength assessment symmetrically to grade 4 at initial assessment. Resolution of macroscopic myoglobinuria and myalgias occurred within 36 hours of admission for hyperhydration, which was well-tolerated per the patient, with adherence monitored via urine output. Over the 3-day hospital stay, renal function was preserved and by discharge there was an 85% reduction from admission peak. At follow-up, twelve days post vaccination there was continued improvement in biochemical markers ( [Table 1](#table1)) and proximal muscle strength gradually 1 |Laboratory findings||Initial value1||Peak the emergency department 60 hours post-vaccination. glomerular filtration rate, and electrolytes were normal. C-reactive protein was Creatine kinase was 246,900 U/L (normal 170 U/L). 32 U/L). Alanine between 935 and 33 without abnormal hepatic markers ( [Table 1](#table1)). Urine dipstick was positive for blood, but there were no erythrocytes on microscopy, indicating myoglobin was the likely cause of the finding on dipstick. Serology for Hepatitis A and B, Parvovirus, Epstein Barr Virus and Cytomegalovirus was negative as was polymerase chain reaction testing for influenza A and B, Parainfluenza, Enterovirus, (nucleocapsid) was negative positive IgG and IgA (Spike; S1). C3 and C4, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, ferritin and ceruloplasmin were within normal limits. IgA, IgG and IgM levels were normal. Antinuclear antibody was negative. Abdominal ultrasound and echocardiogram were both normal. All procedures performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee(s) and with the Helsinki Declaration (as revised in 2013). The investigations done on this patient were part of the standard of care provided. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient herself as she was deemed by the medical team to be competent to provide consent. The patient's parents were agreeable to this case report as well. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the editorial office of this journal. Discussion Rhabdomyolysis has previously been linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection and more recently it has been temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in adults, though no clear established mechanism explains a potential link ( [5](#B5)). While myositis is well-described in infection, and myalgias have been reported in 32% of participants following the second dose, published data does not indicate that there was any episode of clinically significant myositis or that CK levels were evaluated in BNT162b2_V clinical trials ( [6](#B6), [7](#B7)). To our knowledge there are no published pediatric case reports of myositis or rhabdomyolysis in the pre-licensure trials and none since emergency use approval was granted ( [2](#B2)- [5](#B5)). This 16-year-old female presented with severe rhabdomyolysis, without renal impairment, following receipt of the second dose of the BNT162b2_V and was successfully solely managed with hyperhydration, without acute adverse outcome. However, recovery of muscle strength following muscle break down may lag behind biochemical recovery and therefore may impact daily function for several weeks ( [8](#B8)). In the absence of another identifiable trigger, event onset, in close proximity to vaccine administration, raises questions around whether the vaccine could have played a role. A search of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database identified 591 unverified events involving rhabdomyolysis temporally linked to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, as of April 22nd, 2022 ( [9](#B9)). Of these, 396, 148 and 33 cases followed administration of the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen vaccines respectively (two of unknown manufacturer). All but seven cases, following Pfizer/BioNTech administration, and two following Moderna administration, occurred without concurrent myocarditis. However, only nineteen of these events occurred in adolescents ( [Table 2](#table2)), all of whom received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. These events were more commonly reported after repeat vaccine doses and occurred within a week of administration, affecting both males and females across the adolescent age spectrum. Almost half of cases had an identifiable trigger, other than SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and except for our case, CK elevations were mild.

VAERS, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System; M, kinase. In the adult population, there are published case reports of rhabdomyolysis following both adenoviral vector vaccines as well as messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines ( [3](#B3), [4](#B4)). Given that these reports have not been verified to be vaccine-linked and are still extremely rare relative to the millions of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses administered worldwide, it would be difficult at this time to assign more than a temporal association, especially as there are several other recognized triggers for the rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle ( [8](#B8)). Each year, 26,000 cases of rhabdomyolysis are reported in the United States ( [10](#B10)). Common causes of rhabdomyolysis include excessive muscular activity, crush injuries and toxins and infections ( [8](#B8)). Respiratory viruses such as influenza and enteroviruses, but as well herpes group viruses are well-established causes myositis and rhabdomyolysis ( [8](#B8), [11](#B11)). More recently, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been recognized as a cause ( [12](#B12)). Proposed mechanisms include direct viral invasion into muscle, cytokine-induced injury or exaggerated immune response. Vaccines have been associated with inflammatory myopathies and rhabdomyolysis ( [12](#B12), [13](#B13)). Aberrant autoimmune response to adjuvants in vaccines, as seen in the autoimmune inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA), may result in post-vaccination rhabdomyolysis which has been reported following hepatitis B and human papillomavirus vaccines, among others ( [13](#B13)). However, adjuvants like aluminium are not present in BNT162b2_V. Post-vaccination autoimmune phenomena other than ASIA have been documented in connection to a variety of vaccinations with report of rhabdomyolysis secondary to H1N1 influenza vaccination ( [14](#B14)); molecular mimicry has been suggested as a potential explanation ( [15](#B15)). Of note, genetic similarity has been established between the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, a core element of the BNT162b2_V, and several human proteins ( [16](#B16)). As of-yet, no clear peptide sharing between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and skeletal muscle-related proteins has been identified, reactions to vaccines resulting in eosinophilic myocarditis have been reported following hepatitis, meningococcal and some combination vaccines however ( [17](#B17)). As such reactions may occur without peripheral eosinophilia, tissue biopsy demonstrating eosinophilic infiltrates is confirmatory. Although a hypersensitivity response was considered, eosinophilia and urticaria were absent. We are not aware of any cases of eosinophilic myositis following vaccines. Lastly, there is a potential that recipients who were previously infected with SARS-CoV2 before vaccination may have a pronounced immune response, which was the case in one of the published reports in an adult ( [2](#B2)). However, given the absence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to the nucleocapsid, we were unable to demonstrate evidence that our patient had had a preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we cannot exclude a distant infection more than 3 months prior, given natural immunity may wane after 3 months ( [18](#B18)). Even in the absence of a past infection, an immune-mediated adverse event would be more likely to occur after the expected boosting from the second dose and may explain why most of cases ( [Table 2](#table2)) occurred after the second dose. Although, we were able to demonstrate an immune response to BNT162b2_V in our patient given she had both IgG and IgA to spike protein, her nonspecific antibody assay (IgG, IgA and IgM) showed no evidence of a non-specific hyperimmune response. Although the temporal proximity to the vaccine raises the possibility of a link, we cannot assign causality. With over 3.85 million adolescents and children in Canada and over 27.7 million adolescents and children in the United States already receiving at least one dose of the vaccine ( [19](#B19), [20](#B20)), even if this were causal, it would be extremely rare. As such the clear benefits of mRNA vaccines in reducing deaths and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 infections far outweigh potential risk of rare adverse events. Conclusions Our report is unique in that it represents the first pediatric case of severe rhabdomyolysis with more than 1,000-fold increase in CK levels following BNT162b2_V with no other identifiable potential triggers. Although our case had a good outcome, severe rhabdomyolysis can be associated with unfavorable outcomes. As more healthy adolescents with robust immune systems become vaccinated, it will be important for clinicians to monitor for rhabdomyolysis among other adverse events post-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pediatric patients. However, robust, vaccine safety monitoring systems are in place in North America to rapidly detect potential safety signals. Such systems ensure that as pediatric vaccination rates increase, very rare potential adverse events are identified, and follow-up studies are conducted. Patient perspective Our patient shared the following with us: \"This experience was very unexpected and scary- especially because I was trying to do something to keep from getting sick. All of my muscles hurt so badly that everyday activities like lifting my arms, getting out of bed, walking, and eating were extremely painful and took a lot of effort. Once out of the hospital, it took about a month for me to feel like I was back to my usual strength. I am very happy to be fully recovered and so thankful for all of the care I was given.\" Acknowledgments We would like to acknowledge our patient for seeing the value in sharing her experience to educate other health care providers.
