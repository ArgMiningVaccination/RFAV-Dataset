More studies are required to determine the safety of other herbal products used during pregnancy. This Study Summary was published on March 2, 2022. Background Due to the potential risks of some pharmaceuticals, pregnant women may seek out herbal products to relieve pregnancy-related ailments such as morning sickness. Although herbal products are often considered safer due to their natural origins, they contain active substances that may affect the safety of pregnant women or the development of the fetus. The study This literature review examined the available evidence on the safety and efficacy of herbal products, including cranberry extract, chamomile, Echinacea purpurea (aka echinacea), garlic, ginger, Ginkgo biloba (aka ginkgo biloba), and peppermint. Due to a lack of controlled trials with pregnant participants, this review included evidence from rodent studies, which often use high doses and may indicate effects that are not present in humans. The available human evidence included prospective studies that may indicate negative associations without a causal relationship. For example, in some regions, the use of herbal medicines during pregnancy is more common among people with low socioeconomic status. The results The authors of this review stated that ginger is undoubtedly the most analyzed herbal remedy used in pregnancy. Research in randomized controlled trials suggests that ingestion of 1,000 milligrams of ginger per day may relieve nausea symptoms and does not increase the frequency of adverse effects for pregnant women or their developing fetuses. The authors noted that some food safety authorities still caution that there is a lack of known safe consumption limits for ginger. There is some indication that inhalation of peppermint oil can reduce nausea, and it was not associated with any adverse effects in human or rodent research. Research in rodents indicates potential negative effects of cranberry extract, echinacea, and ginkgo biloba. Although these products are widely used by pregnant women, there is insufficient high-quality human evidence to confirm the products' safety. The authors found inadequate evidence for the effectiveness of cranberry extract, echinacea, ginkgo biloba, chamomile, or peppermint to ease ailments in pregnant women. Chamomile is commonly used by pregnant women, both topically and orally. An Italian cohort study of 392 pregnant women indicated a higher frequency of threatening miscarriages and preterm labors among women who used chamomile products compared to those who did not. However, a Canadian study compared women who had premature delivery and term delivery and found a similar frequency of chamomile use in both groups. Again, a lack of quality evidence prevents definitive conclusions about safety. Rodent studies have indicated that consumption of garlic extract during pregnancy and lactation may reduce the negative effects of lead exposure on infants. However, the studies used daily doses of 100 grams per kilogram of body weight and higher, which may not be safe or feasible in humans. No serious adverse reactions were reported in human placebo-controlled studies, and a population-based cohort study found that garlic consumption was associated with reduced risk of spontaneous preterm delivery. The authors noted that garlic consumption can change the smell of breast milk, but did not indicate whether the smell alters infant willingness to breastfeed. Note Although the available evidence is inadequate to form scientifically rigorous conclusions, individual pregnant women might find reassurance in the widespread use of these products without strong evidence of harm. However, pregnant women should consult with their medical professionals to determine what is safe and appropriate.
