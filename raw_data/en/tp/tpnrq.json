We join you in anticipation of a rewarding educational experience at our institution as y ou prepare for careers as clinicians, teachers, and physician/scientists. We at Icahn School of Medicine are committed to providing an exciting and healthy environment for all students in the classroom, on the clinical services, and throughout the School a nd its affiliate institutions. In this regard it is particularly gratifying that Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai was the first recipient of the Paul R. Wright Excellence in Medical Education Award from the American Medical Student Association for b eing the school that has provided the safest and healthiest learning environment for its students. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai prides itself on being recognized as the medical school which promotes the well -being of its medical students through a healthy and affirming educational environment. The Student Handbook contributes toward our objectives. It is designed to provide you not only with a reference source detailing the relevant school policies, procedures, and programs that affect your day -to- day functions as a student but also with a guide to an understanding and clarification of its components. As such, we hope you will find it a useful distillation of the cumulative experiences of those who have dealt with the many school, state, and federal rules and regulations that affect student interests. It should be read carefully and used as a reference whenever any questions concerning policy or procedures arise. While this Handbook serves to clarify and codify, it remains just a guide and should not limit individual potential or preferences. On the contrary, it should assist you in choosing from the wide range of educational and counseling opportunities available to you. To enhance your flexibility as you undertake your studies, the Administration and the Faculty are prepared to review and modify procedures and programs to improve overall effectiveness and, when appropriate, in response to individual student needs. Your suggestions and comments are welcomed and should be forwarded through individual members of the Faculty, the Department of Medical Education , or through one of your various student representatives who serve you in committee functions. Again, welcome and best wishes for a happy and productive year. Dennis Charney , MD Dean, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai David Muller, M D Dean for Medical Education Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 2 July 2014 About Mount Sinai History On January 15, 1852, nine men representing a variety of Jewish charities met to discuss a shared vision of free medical care for indigent Jews in New York City. In 1855 that vision came to fruition with the establishment of the 45 -bed Jews' Hospital in New York in what was then a rural neighborhood on West 28th Stree t between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Although the hospital was intended as a sectarian institution, the Jews' Hospital accepted emergency patients of any religious affiliation. In its first year of operation, the majority of patients were foreign born. The hospital was expanded during the Civil War to accommodate Union soldiers. As the Jews' Hospital was a charitable enterprise, its directors relied on the gifts of friends and members, as well as payments from the state and city, to provide enough to subsi dize care. To maintain its eligibility for state and city support, the Jews' Hospital formally abandoned its sectarian charter in 1866 and was renamed The Mount Sinai Hospital. Its patient base, however, remained predominantly Jewish. In 1872, it moved to a new 120 -bed facility on Lexington Avenue, between 66th and 67th Streets, nearly tripling its original capacity. The School of Medicine opens in 1968 . Since its founding, The Mount Sinai Hospital has moved three times, and with each move came an expansi on of services. The first buildings at its current 1,171 -bed location on Fifth Avenue at 100 th Street were dedicated in 1904. In the late 1950s the Hospital began plans to establish its own medical school, an unusual move for a hospital. With its chartering in 1963, Mount Sinai School of Medicine became the first medical school to grow out of a non -university in more than 50 years. The fact that the Hospital was encouraged to found a school is a testament to its tradition of excellence in patient care as well as research. Mount Sinai School of Medicine opened in 1968 in affiliation with The City University of New York. In building the medical school, trustees envisioned a new kind of medical institution \u2014 a university of health sciences. This new institu tion would encompass a medical school supported by a strong teaching hospital, a graduate school of biologic sciences, a graduate school of physical sciences, and an undergraduate school representing allied health fields The students in the newly formed M ount Sinai School of Medicine consisted of 36 first year students, a third year class with 23 students and 19 graduate students. In January 2013 Mount Sinai School of Medicine was renamed the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 3 July 2014 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai ranks among the top 20 medical schools in receipt of National Institute of Health grants. U.S. News & World Report ranks Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 1 9th out of 1 53 medical schools in its 2014 -15 \"America's Best Graduate Schools\" issue. About the Mount Sinai Health System The Mount Sinai Health System is an integrated health care system providing exceptional medical care to our local and global communities. Encompassing the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and seven hospital campuses in the New York metropolitan area, as well as a large, regional ambulatory footprint, Mount Sinai is acclaimed internationally for its excellence in research, patient care, and education across a range of specialties. T he Mount Sinai Health System was created from the combination of The Mount Sinai Medical Center and Continuum Health Partners, which both agreed unanimously to combine the two entities in July 2013. Affilia ted Institutions Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai currently has academic affiliation with several institutions, not limited to but including Atlantic Health, the Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical Center; Elmhurst Hospital Center; Englewood Hospital and Medical Center; and the Jewish Home and Hospital. The academic affiliates work with the School of Medicine and The Mount Sinai Hospital to coordinate educational programs for students, residents, fellows, and attending physicians. Because the patients from these institutions represent the broad range of social, economic, and ethnic groups that comprise our region, the affiliate system enhances the educational experience at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The newest affiliate includes the Atlantic Health System with diverse and dedicated educational opportunities for Icahn School of Medicine students under the direction of superb mentorship. The following is a brief description of our major affiliates: Atlantic Health Renowned for its breadth of expert cardiac services, Morristown Memorial Hospital performs the second most heart surgeries in the New York metropolitan area. Overlook H ospital , the regional leader in comprehensive stroke care and neurosciences , was the first hospital in the Northeast to offer CyberKnife treatment, a leading technology for precision radiat ion in the treatment of prostate cancer, brain tumors, spine, lung, liver and pancreatic cancers. Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical Center Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Bronx VAMC) offers general hospital services to veterans from the Bronx and other boroughs of New York City, Long Island, Westchester County, Rockland County, and eastern New Jersey, as well as to patients from more d istant points, who are referred for its special services. It serves as the tertiary care referral center from two other VA Medical Centers. The institution became fully affiliated with Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in 1969 and in 1981 moved into a modern, well- equipped facility. There is a modern research facility at VAMC that houses many of the school's leading scientists. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 4 July 2014 Elmhurst Hospital Center Elmhurst Hospital Center is a 526 -bed public hospital providing primary, secondary, and tertiary me dical care to over one million ethnically and culturally diverse people in the northwest section of Queens.

Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 6 July 2014 Immunization Policy Immunization requirements are outlined on the enrollment website. Immunizations are required for diphtheria , tetanus and pertussis (if not administered within the past 10 years) and polio (if initial series and booster have not been given). If students do not have proof of immunity to measles, mumps and rubella, varicella, or Hepatit is B, the appropriate vaccine will be administered and follow up titers will be performed to verify protection . Upon enrollment at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai , students must have an annual PPD test to screen for exposure to tuberculosis. Annual PPD testing is required of all students. Students can obtain their annual through the annual PPD fairs , and it is the student's responsibility to maintain compliance. Students with a history of a previously positive PPD must submit a copy of a chest x -ray report dated within six months of enrollment. Annual screening will subsequently be performed with a symptom -based checklist and annual chest x -rays are not required. Failure to adhere to tuberculosis screening will result in an administrative leave of absence . Students will not be allowed to continue in classes, clerkships, or perform research in their assigned labs. Students who are recent converters will be managed appropriately with chest x -rays to rule out the presence of active disease a nd prophylaxis with medications. Failure to follow appropriate treatment will result in dismissal from the institution. Individual health information is confidential; however, non -compliance with the above regulations will be forwarded to the Registrar for \" student health hold ,\" to the individual Program Directors for the Graduate School or to the Associate Dean of Student Affairs for the School of Medicine . Student Health Insurance All students are required to retain basic health insurance. Icahn School of Medicine provides insurance for students at both individual and family rates. Students may choose to add optional dental and/or vision plan. Election of the plans takes place upon enrollment and may be changed each June for the next academic y ear. Students who wish to waive enrollment in the Icahn School of Medicine insurance plan must register for a waiver and provide proof of insurance. Students are strongly encouraged to research the availability and ease of accessing insurance providers in the NY area; for instance, California's Kaiser Insurance is not accepted locally. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai insurance plan provides coverage for physician and hospital services through a network of participating physicians, laboratories, and diagnostic centers. The SHC will use the network physicians for consultation referrals but it is up to the student to verify that the provider is in network prior to the appointment (as physicians' affiliations with insurance companies change frequently). There should not be any charge to students for laboratory tests or x-rays if a participating laboratory is used. Prescriptions are available for generic and brand medications with co -payment in the Mount Sinai Employee Pharmacy, provided the medication prescribed is in the Pharmacy formulary. Students who receive prescriptions for medications not carried by the formulary can obtain prescriptions at a local drug store. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 7 July 2014 Each June, the o pen enrollment period for students takes place. During the month, students who wish to make adjustments to t heir insurance coverage will be able to update their benefit choices. During this time period, students enroll or dis enroll in any combination of health, dental, and vision coverage. However, students must always carry basic health insurance. If a student disenrolls from the Icahn School of Medicine plan, they must file a waiver form in the Enrollment Services Office and present proof of insurance from another source. Students who anticipate an eminent change in insurance needs should consult with a member of the Enrollment Services staff for guidance. When a student marries, has a child, or goes off their parent's insurance policy s/he must notify the Enrollment Services Office immediately following that event so that the policy can be altered appropriately. Coverage will be terminated by the school upon graduation or if a student does not re -enroll for the next academic year. Dental and Vision Care Students have the option to elect Dental and/or Vision coverage at their expense. Policy information is available in the Office of Enrollment Services. The same annual enrollment dates for Medical Coverage enrollment also pertain to Dental and Vision coverage. Mental Health Se rvices Rapid access to strictly confidential psychological and psychiatric consultation, counseling, treatment, and referral is available to students through the Student Mental Health Service Office. The Director of Student Mental Health and the team will personally provide care for students who have short -term needs (up to 12 sessions) and will perform initial assessments and make affordable referrals for those with long- term needs. There is a multi -disciplinary referral base to provide additional student mental health services. Services provided to students by the Director of Student Mental Health will not incur a bill to the student, regardless of their insurance plan. Any referral for long -term care will require payment according to the insurance plan or a negotiated fee (e.g. Mount Sinai faculty). Mental health services provided by the Director of Student Mental Health will be treated with the same level of confidentiality as required for all patients by New York State Law and the ethics of the American Psychological Association. Confidentiality is strictly and carefully protected by HIPAA laws. We will not release any personal medical or psychiatric in formation to anyone without a student's clear and written consent. Dr. Jeffrey Newcorn , Direct or of Student Mental Health, can confidentially: Phone: 212 -659- 8705. Email: jeffrey.newcorn@mssm.edu .

It is expected that students follow the published protocols immediately as anti -retroviral therapy for HIV exposure, if recommended, should commence immediately. Exposure to hepatitis B or C may require therapy or further follow -up. Care, evaluation, and e xpert advice must be available to students regarding relative risks, options for therapy, and follow -up. Coordination of affiliate sites has been accomplished so that students have a clear idea of the protocol to follow and students receive state- of-the-art care. Students must attend annual seminars conducted by infection control experts and documentation of attendance will become a permanent part of the student's file.

Reapplication is required annually for all loan and scholarship recipients. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 21 July 2014 Determin ation of Need Financial need reflects the difference between a student and his/her family's calculated resources and financial strength and the total anticipated school related expenses for a given academic year. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai utilizes the standard federal formula for determining financial aid eligibility. Funds will be made available through the School according to demonstrated proof of financial need. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai reserves the right to reconsider its of fer and commitments of financial assistance in the event of a financial award made from an outside source. (Required adjustments will be applied to the loan portion of the financial aid package wherever possible.) All Cost of Attendance Budgets cover the s tudent only. Federal law prohibits using federal funds for the support of anyone other than the student. Need Access The Need Access application is used for medical students who want to apply for need -based scholarships and Title VII and Institutional fund s. In determining financial need, the Committee requires the student to submit information via the web to the Access Group, http://www.needaccess.org . These data provide a complete financial picture for each student so that every applicant can be reviewed individually, but uniformly. Need Access collects information about the student, the student's spouse, and the student's parent(s)/stepparent(s) inclu ding a detailed description of resources, assets, and income, as well as liabilities, expenses and special circumstances. The information provides an estimate of the student's financial strength and resources, as well as an estimate of the amount the stude nt and his/her family may reasonably be expected to contribute. Although the system acknowledges a shift in financial responsibilities at the professional school level, it nevertheless continues to recognize that the basic responsibility for financing a st udent's cost of education falls upon the student and his/her family Entrance Interviews As part of their financial aid package, all students receive a Financial Aid Entrance Interview form listing their loan obligations upon graduation. They must sign, i ndicating they understand these obligations. Each award letter they receive will outline the terms (interest rates and repayment options) for the loans received. Online tutorials related to debt management are a required part of the loan process. Exit In terviews Students who have been issued loans from Icahn School of Medicine controlled funds (Perkins, Mount Sinai Endowments, etc.) and recipients of Stafford Loans and other federal loans will meet with a representative of the Office of Student Financial Services prior to graduation or separation. Loans will be summarized; terms of repayment, deferment and responsibility will be discussed. Debt Management and Counseling Throughout medical school the Office of Student Financial Services is available to disc uss indebtedness, career choices, and money management issues. Graduating seniors should be aware of the requirements of the various external student loan programs in which they may have participated. It is important to maintain contact with Icahn School o f Medicine at Mount Sinai and the appropriate lending institutions to Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 22 July 2014 understand the terms of each loan program, and to plan for repayment. Timely loan repayments are essential in establishing a good credit rating. The extent that loan indebtedness will im pact on future expense budgeting can be considerable. In order to assist student in tracking loans, interest rates and various conditions of the loans, the Enrollment Services Office suggests that one of the websites below be consulted for debt -management information and encourages students to avail themselves of these tools. The methodology converts cumulative educational debts into estimates of approximate periodic repayments over a ten -year period. https://www.aamc.org/services/first/first_for_students/ https://www.aamc.org/services/first/48720 /first_resources.html Outside Scholarships for Medical Students Outside scholarships funds will substitute for loan funds in the standard financial aid package. Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Academic Progress refers to the satisfact ory completion of course s, clerkships and relevant licensing examinations within the required timeframe established by the School of Medicine . Additionally, federal regulations require that students receiving federal aid make satisfactory academic progress (SAP) in accordance with the se standards set by the School of Medicine . All students in the MD program are expected to complete 8 semesters of full time enrollment. The maximum number of semesters a student may be enrol led to meet the requirements of the MD program is 12. The pace of progress is as follows: students must complete Y ear 1 and Y ear 2 requirements within three years of active enrollment and likewise for Year 3 and 4. Time dedicated to scholarly activity and leaves of absence are not counted in the assessment of pace. Students must pass all Y ear 1 courses to move onto Year 2 and all their Year 2 courses and take USMLE Step 1 to advance to Year 3. Third -year clerkships must be taken and completed in Y ear 3 in order to advance to year 4. Only the Anesthesia clerkship is potentially deferrable to Year 4. Students must pass Step 2 CK and CS and all Year 4 rotations, as well as complete 21 weeks of elect ive credit prior to graduation. Enrollment Services and Student Affairs will assess each student's academic progress on an annual basis. A student who is not making SAP will be notified in writing of this and the r easons for this determination. A student w ho is not meeting SAP may be required to appear before the Promotions Committee. A student who fails to meet one or more of the standards for SAP is ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term in which the SAP requi rements were not met. In this situation, the student can be placed on financial aid probation and receive aid if the Promotions Committee approves an academic plan for the student that will ensure, if followed, that the student is able to meet the SAP by a specific point of time, normally an academic year. A student must be enrolled in at least 50% of a course load to remain eligible for financial aid. A student shall become eligible again for financial aid when he or she has satisfactorily completed su fficient coursework to meet the standards of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 23 July 2014 progress within the maximum time frames delineated above . A student who does not meet the SAP requirements by the end of the financial aid probationary period is ineligible for financial aid. Length of Time to Complete Degree A student will be permitted a maximum time limit to complete a degree: Degree Normal Limit (Years) Maximum Limit (Years) MD 4 6 MD / PhD 8 10 PhD (Biological Sciences) 5 7 Master's Programs 1.5 2 These time limits include any time for personal or medical leave of absence, but do not include approved periods of Special Matriculation for research or remediation. In the Ph D, MD/Ph D, and MS programs, benchmarks of satisfactory progress must be completed as outlined in the specific program requirements. Students who are approaching the time limit for completion will be reviewed with enough notice so that a plan is in place to enable the student to complete the requirements by the end of the time limit. Completion of Course Requiremen ts A student must complete with passing grades at least 75 percent of the full -time curriculum for which s/he was enrolled in any academic year. A student who does not meet this standard will be placed on financial aid probation for one term. If the standards are not met at the end of that term, suspension of all aid is in effect until the standards are met. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 24 July 2014 Degree Programs Offered at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Scientist Training Program (MD/PhD) The Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) was developed for students interested in a career in biomedically -related research and academic medicine. MD/PhD Students enter the program as \"flexible entry\" students, leaving all PhD training options open. T raining is organized in 8 multidisciplinary training areas. Generally, MSTP students complete the first two years of the MD curriculum before beginning the research phase of the program. Students entering into the dual program take advantage of the flexibility in the School's curricular structure to complete the graduate school's Core curriculum during their first year of training. They partial substitute this work for a block of the School of Medicine curriculum. First - year MD/PhD students also begin othe r portio ns of their graduate program \u2014laboratory rotations during the summers, Introduction to Journal Club and Responsible Conduct of Research. Students are required to participate in the Medical Scientist Research Seminars (MSRS); a special seminar series that gives MD/PhD students the opportunity to hear presentations by other MD/PhD students as well as new faculty. MD/PhD students take the other elements of the initial School of Medicine curriculum and thus forge bonds with both the entering PhD and MD c lasses. Laboratory Rotation helps guide MD/PhD students towards an optimal choice of preceptor and MTA. The minimum rotation period is six weeks of fulltime work and students are expected to formulate a multidisciplinary training area decision on their ch oice of a research preceptor by the end of the summer between the first and second year in the program. The PhD work is usually completed during the three to four years after the initial two years of the School of Med icine and Graduate School coursework. D uring the final year of PhD phase, students will participate in an intensive clinical refresher. This will involve spending one morning each week with specially chosen clinical preceptors. Students can take maximal advantage of the flexibility of timing fo r entry into the clinical clerkships to complete the total program without \"down time,\" and also position the major clinical work in closest juxtaposition to the postgraduate residency training that most MD/PhD students elect after graduation. MD/PhD students will not be permitted to begin the third year of the MD curriculum after the PhD period of work unless the dissertation is both defended and deposited. The responsibility for open, realistic and careful planning is shared by the student and preceptor. This provides the maximum opportunity for the student to do the best possible job in both arenas. MD/PhD students who return to the third year of medical school must complete the same clinical requirements as other medical students during a period of two years, which includes an appreciable amount of elective time, or in a more condensed period with less elective time. Careful planning, in consultation with the clinical advisors and MD/PhD directors, will afford students the smoothest transition back to clinical medicine. Enough flexibility also exists so that elec tive time may be shifted to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 25 July 2014 beginning of an academic year to allow an MD/PhD student to finish up experimental or dissertation work. Thus students are readily able to enter clerkships at various times between July and August. Many students will have co mpleted the requirements without losing any of their clinical elective time. They may, and often do, choose to spend some of that elective time in the laboratory, continuing offshoots of their projects. Several other students have used that elective time d uring the final phase of the Program to explore research programs elsewhere, e.g. at the NIH. Students entering the fourth MD year should investigate the USMLE time limit set by some states for taking Step III. Students should check the USMLE website ( www.usmle.org ) for further details. Licensure is determined by state and students may wish to refer to the following website to obtain additional information: http://www.fsmb.org . MD/Ph D students should refer to other sections of the handbook for further details on the USMLE, information on clinical career choices and residency programs.

MD/MSCR Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai's Master's of Science in Clinical Research Program was approved by New York State in 2003 as a two -year part -time program to offer training to fellows and junior faculty in clinical research methodology. As interest by medical students in clinical research grew, the program was expanded to provide our medical students with the opportunity to earn a dual MD/MSCR degree. The curriculum includes courses necessary to do independent patient -oriented research, including: Designing Clinical and Public Health Research Studies, Introduction to Biostatistics, Multivariable Analysis, Professionalism and Ethics in Clinical Research, and Bioinformatics. Students also have the opportunity to take electives courses from the other Graduate School programs: the Master of Public Health, Master in Genetic Counseling, and Graduate School of Bio medica l Sciences. These courses cover a broad array of disciplines and methods across the full spectrum of clinical and translational research. The program is designed to enable participants to translate the discoveries about the mechanisms underlying disease, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 28 July 2014 made in the laboratory, into new approaches to prevention, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of disease. More over, the dual -degree aims to make these new approaches part of clinical practice. Interested students should contact Karen Zier, Ph D, Associate Dean for Medical Student Research, 212- 241-4429 Leaving Part of a Dual Degree Program Any MD/PHD student who decides to leave the MD or the PHD portion of their dual program must meet with the Dean or the Dean's designee from each program and his or her course must be approved by the Promotions Committee or the Graduate School Promotions Committee.

For more Building, 21st Floor, Room 21 -70 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 34 July 2014 Institutional Policies and Guidelines Campus -Wide Policies, Regulations, and Requirements Introduction In accordance with the requirements of the Education Law of the State of New York, the Trustees of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have adopted rules and regulations for the maintenance of order and have established a program for their enforcement: Violations of these policies and regulations by students shall be referred to the Dean for Medical Education or Dean of the Graduate School and be handled as set forth in this Handbook. Rules of Conduct 1. All members of the School community, which for the purposes of these Rules and Regulations shall be defined as including faculty, students, organizations, members of the staff of the School, and all visitors and other licensees and invitees are expected to obey all national, state , and local laws. 2. All memb ers of the School community are prohibited from conduct which is proximate cause of or does unreasonably and unduly impede, obstruct or interfere with the orderly and continuous administration and operation of the School in the use of its facilities and th e achievement of its purposes as an educational institution, or in its rights as a campus proprietor. Such conduct shall include, but is not limited to, that which is the actual or proximate cause of any of the following: a. Unreasonable interference with the rights of others; b. Intentional injury to School property; c. Unauthorized occupancy of classrooms, laboratories, libraries, faculty and administrative offices, patient care facilities, auditoriums, public halls and stairway s, recreational areas and any other facilities used by the School (unauthorized occupancy being defined as failure to vacate any such facility when duly requested by the Dean, an Associate Dean, Assistant Dean, Hospital Administrator of similar responsibility or chair of a department of the School); d. Malicious use of or intentional damage to personal property, including records, papers and writings of any member of the School community; e. Any action or situation which recklessly or intentionally endangers th e mental or physical health or involves the forced consumption of liquor or drugs for the purpose of initiation into or affiliation with any organization. The penalties set forth in Part II are in addition to any penalty pursuant to the penal law or any ot her chapter to which the violator or organization may be subject for violation of this paragraph. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 35 July 2014 f. Violations of these policies and regulations by students shall be referred to the Dean for Medical Education or Dean of the Graduate School. g. Nothing contained in any of the foregoing Rules and Regulations is intended to nor shall it be construed to limit or restrict freedom of speech or of peaceful assembly, or other individual rights guaranteed by the Constitutio n. h. The administration and faculty of the School are committed to providing a safe and healthy learning environment for all students. Students should conduct themselves appropriately everywhere on the campus of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Mount Sinai Health System , and at affiliated institu tions. Appropriate behavior is mandatory when participating in patient care or attending any functions at which patients may be present. In small group seminars, as well as during clinical activities, students are evaluated not only on their fund of knowle dge and ability to use this knowledge but also on their responsibility, dependability, reliability, maturity, motivation, attitude, honesty, integrity, and ability to relate and interact effectively with others. i. Equally important, however, is the realizat ion that one's responsibilities do not end with individual behavior but also include not tolerating inappropriate behavior among others. While formal mechanisms, outlined in other sections, exist to provide due process for any specific allegations of inapp ropriate behavior, general issues should be able to be discussed freely among peers, faculty, and administration. Concerns requiring confidentiality should be discussed with the Dean of the Graduate School, individual faculty advisors, or through the Schoo l's Ombudsman Program. Authorship Policy Assignment of authorship documents the contributions individuals have made to a published work. Thus, authorship constitutes a key criterion by which funding agencies, academic institutions, and the wider academic community judge the contributions of academics to their fields. Appropriate assignment of authorship is an essential component of ethical conduct for academics. Authorship on a publication implies substantial contribution to work being reported, which enta ils critical intellectual and/or technical contributions without which the publication as it exists would not have been possible. Contributions that merit authorship include a significant role in planning the studies, writing the manuscript, and other esse ntial roles involving unique skills. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines recommend that each author have responsibility for at least one component of the work, and that all authors approve the final version. Listing th e explicit contributions of each author, as many journals currently require, is indeed a valuable and recommended method for disclosing and clarifying the rationale for the inclusion and order of authors. The contributions of colleagues or collaborators wh ose participation does not warrant authorship should be acknowledged. The requirement of substantial contribution clearly precludes unethical practices such as honorary authorships for senior colleagues who made minimum contributions to the work, colleague s whose role Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 36 July 2014 was solely to obtain funding or similar resources for the work, or contracted individuals who simply carried out routine services for hire. This same principle precludes omitting from authorship colleagues who did make substantial contribution s. Ghostwriting, in which an individual takes credit as an author of a manuscript substantially written by an uncredited third party, is never permissible. In summary, authorship credit can be established by the following three criteria: (1) providing subs tantial contributions to study concept and design, or acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data critical for the study; (2) drafting the article or revising its content critically; and (3) approving the final version to be published. All authors listed on an article must fulfill criteria (1) and/or (2), and must fulfill criterion (3). It is expected that inclusion and order of authors will be discussed among all of the authors (including students and postdoctoral fellows). This should occur as early in the scientific process as possible, prior to drafting the manuscript when feasible and certainly prior to submission of the manuscript for initial peer review. Such dialogue is essential for all manuscripts and requires exceptional attention in collabo rations involving multiple laboratories or institutions. Whether a contribution is substantial enough to merit authorship may sometimes be a matter of judgment, usually decided by the senior author(s). After authorship and order of authorship have been ass igned by the senior author(s), in consultation with, and preferably also in agreement with all authors, the senior author(s) should be able to defend the assignments based on the principles articulated above; final decision on authorship rests with the sen ior author(s). Members of the scientific team are strongly urged to resolve any disagreements concerning authorship as quickly and amicably as possible, in order to avoid ongoing disputes that could impede or prevent publication of a manuscript. In the eve nt that a disagreement cannot be resolved within the team, the Department Chair should be consulted for guidance. Updated October 2011 Family Education Rights and Privacy Act The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and its subsequent amendmen ts afford students certain rights with respect to their educational records. As detailed below, students have the right to: Inspect and review their education records. Seek amendment of their education records if they believe them to be inaccurate, misle ading, or otherwise in violation of their privacy rights. Consent to certain disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in their education records. File complaints with the Department of Education concerning any alleged failure to comply with FERPA's requirements. Student Access Rights All currently registered and former students of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have the right to review and inspect their official education records at the School (including, for example, admissions and academic records prepared and maintained by the Registrar) in accordance with these rules. Students who wish to review their records should make an appointment with the Registrar. Access will be granted within Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 37 July 2014 45 days from the receipt of the written request to inspect records. Students have a right to a response to a reasonable request for explanations and interpretations of the student's educational records. Students seeking explanations or interpretations of their educational record may make an appointment with the Associate Dean of the Graduate School or Associate Dean for Student Affairs - Medical Education , as appropriate based on the student's program. If the Associate Dean is unable to provide a satisfactor y explanation, the student will be referred to the Dean for Graduate Education or Dean for Medical Education, as appropriate. Students may not copy records unless the failure to produce copies would prevent the student from exercising his/her right to in spect and review records. A copying fee will be charged. Limitation on Access A. The Act limits a student's right to access information contained in his/her education records. Accordingly, the School need not permit students to view: 1) Financial records, including information regarding the student's parent(s), such as parental tax forms and other parental records submitted in support of a student's financial aid application or claim of New York residence. 2) Confidential statements and letters of recommendatio n placed in a student's file prior to January 1, 1975, provided that they are used for the purpose for which they were specifically intended. 3) Confidential letters of recommendation placed in the student's file after January 1, 1975, if: i. The student has wai ved in a signed writing his/her right to inspect and review those letters (see below); and ii. The letters are related to the student's (i) admission to an educational institution; (ii) application for employment; or (iii) receipt of an honor or honorary recog nition. A. Records of instructional, administrative and supervisory staff which are in the sole possession of such personnel. B. Records of professional and paraprofessional personnel which are created, maintained and used solely for the purpose of treatment and are disclosed only to individuals providing the treatment. The student has the right, however, to have such records reviewed by an appropriate professional of his/her choice. C. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai does not require students to waive thei r right of access to educational records as a condition for admission to the School, for receipt of financial aid or other services or benefits from the School, or for any other purpose. Under certain circumstances, however, a student may wish to waive his /her right of access to confidential letters of recommendation. A student may do so by signing a waiver form. In this event, the student will be notified upon request of the names of persons making such recommendations and the recommendations will be used solely for the purpose for which they are intended. A waiver may Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 38 July 2014 be revoked in writing with respect to actions occurring after the revocation. Waiver forms are available in the Registrar's Office. Amendments and Hearing Rights If a student believes that his/her education records contain information that is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student's rights of privacy, he or she may ask the School to amend the record. Requests for amendments shall be directed to the Registrar, who will respond to the request within a reasonable time. If the request is denied, the student will be notified of his/her right to appeal that decision as specified below. When the request for an amendment is denied, the student may request a hearing to challen ge the content of the record on the grounds that the information contained in the record is inaccurate, misleading or in violation of the student's privacy rights. Requests for hearing must be submitted in writing to the Associate Dean for Graduate Education or the Associate Dean for Student Affairs - Medical Education (as appropriate) within 10 days of receiving the Registrar's response denying a request for amendment as discussed above.

Information Sharing and Confidentiality Icahn School of Medicine recognizes that confidentiality is very important to students. It is a basic right and privilege and we believe that the issue of confidentiality is part of the trust that we expect and value Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 42 July 2014 among students, teachers and administrative personnel. The following clarifies the protection of information related to students: Health Information A. All student health information is protected information. There should be no sharing of information except as provided by HIPAA for the care of the student as patien t. Teachers, administrative personnel and deans may not receive health information from students' health care providers except as provided by HIPAA. B. There is certain information that hospitals and health care facilities require as a condition of employme nt. That information includes PPD, immunizations, and in some cases evidence of toxicology results. Students will be informed that that information is being shared as obtained by Student Health as composite data (we only know who does not comply with c ompleting this information and then would deny clinical privileges but do not know the exact results). C. Toxicology screening is an institutional requirement. Any positive result will be reviewed by senior administrative representatives of the Deans (Graduate School and School of Medicine ). The school may require a toxicology screen from any student at any time without need for a stated reason. Failure to comply with toxicology testing in the timeframe required will result in dismissal from school. D. There are times when the Administration may ask a student to comply with an Administrative Psychiatric evaluation. When it is decided that such an evaluation is necessary, the student will be informed and will be apprised of the list of questions that will be sent to an administrative evaluator (usually a psychiatrist). Students do not have the option to decline such an evaluation when required and would be dismissed from school if they fail to comply. The information referred back to the School will be discussed with the student and will remain in the student's file which can only be opened by a Dean or his official representative or if requested as a legal document. Academic Information Academic information is maintained by the School Registrar. A. Stud ents have access to their academic file for review but will not be given copies of their file. B. The Registrar will not permit dissemination of the file information without the signed consent of a student unless required by law in accordance with FERPA Polic y. C. Current teachers and clerkship directors do not have access to the student file, only deans and student affairs personnel in the School of Medicine may access the file. D. Any student wishing to review their file may do so in the presence of the Registrar or Dean's Designee coordinated through the Registrar. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 43 July 2014 Other I nformation If a student seeks counsel from a director, dean, teacher , or ombudsman that information should remain confidential between the student and that individual. A. Any plan to discuss information (e.g., Office of Student Affairs Representative or Program Director with one of the Dean's) should be with the student's knowledge and consent. B. Exceptions to this confidentiality include concerns about the safety of the student, someone related to the student, or the student's dependent. Safety concerns include suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, harming another individual substance dependency, behavioral or health concerns that may affect the student or others. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 44 July 2014 Policy on Teaching & Evalu ation by School of Medicine Administration In recognition of the conflicts of interest that can occur when students learn from and are assessed by members of the School of Medicine administration, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has committed itself to the development and dissemination of a policy that is clear, fair and transparent.

B. Promotional Items - Promotional items such as pens, note pads, brochures, and other \"reminder\" items, should not be distributed at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Students are discouraged from bringing such items into the S chool of Medicine , so as to maintain a learning environment free of industry influence. Brochures and other industry -sponsored educational material should not be used for educational purposes. Students are asked to refer to applicable policies such as the AMA S tatement on Gifts to Physicians from Industry ( www.ama -assn.org/ama/pu b/category/4001.html ), and the Accrediting Council for Medical Education Standards for Commercial Support ( www.accme.org ). Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 46 July 2014 C. Gifts - Medical students are discouraged from accepting gifts above and beyond aforementioned promotional items (eg. textbooks, tickets, entertainment, etc.), or monetary compensation of any value, from industry representat ives both on and off the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai campus, related or unrelated to a student's participation in events sponsored by industry. D. Sample Medications - Sample medications should not be distributed on the campus of the Icahn Scho ol of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

This provision may not apply to national or regional merit -based awards, which are considered on a case -by-case basis III. Support for Educational Programs Icahn School of Medicine medical students should be familiar with the Standards for Commercial Support established by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Me dical Education. These standards offer useful means by which to assess all forms of industry interactions, both on and off campus, and including both Icahn School of Medicine -sponsored events and other events. The standards can be found at www.accme.org . A. On Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Campus - All educational events sponsored by industry on the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai campus must comply fully with ACCME guidelines irrespective of whether or not formal CME credit is awarded. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 47 July 2014 B. Guidelines must include the following if CME credit is to be awarded, and are provided likewise to illustrat e to students some of the decisions that affect the sponsorship and provision of information more generally: 1. All decisions concerning educational needs, objectives, content, methods, evaluation, and speaker are made without commercial interest. (ACCME Standard 1.1) 2. A commercial interest is not assuming the role of a non -accredited partner in a joint sponsorship. (ACCME Standard 1.2) 3. All persons in a position to control the content of an educational activity have disclosed all relevant financial re lationships to the provider of the CME. A relevant financial relationship is defined as one in which an individual (or spouse or partner) has a commercial interest that benefits the individual in any financial amount that has occurred within the past 12 months; and the opportunity to affect that content of CME about the products or services of the commercial interest. Failure to disclose these relationships will result in disqualification of the individual from participation in the CME activity or its planning or evaluation. (ACCME Standard 1.1, 1.2) 4. The lecturer explicitly describes all his or her related financial relationships to the audience at the beginning of the educational activity. If an individual has no relevant financial relationship, the learners should be informed that no relevant financial relationship exists. (ACCME Standard 6.1, 6.2) 5. All conflicts of interest should be identified and resolved prior to the educational activity being delivered to learners. (ACCME Standard 2.3) 6. Wri tten policies and procedures that govern honoraria and reimbursement of out of pocket expenses for planners, teachers, and authors are in place. (ACCME Standard 3.7) 7. Product -promotion material or product -specific advertisements of any type is prohibited in or during CME activities. The juxtaposition of editorial and advertising material on the same products or subjects must be avoided. Live (staffed exhibits, presentation) or enduring (printed or electronic advertisements) promotional activities must be kept separate from CME. (ACCME Standard 4.2) 8. A commercial interest is not used as the agent providing a CME activity to learners, e.g., distribution of self- study CME activities or arranging for electronic access to CME activities. (ACCME Standard 4.5) 9. The content of format of a CME activity or its related materials must promote improvements or quality in healthcare and not a specific proprietary business interest of a commercial interest. (ACCME Standard 5.1) Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 48 July 2014 10. Attendees in the audience are not com pensated or otherwise materially rewarded for attendance, e.g., through payment of travel expenses, lodging, honoraria, or personal expenses. (ACCME Standard 3.12) 11. In addition to the aforementioned ACCME Standards, should the Icahn School of Medicin e at Mount Sinai host an educational event sponsored by industry on the Icahn School of Medicine campus, the funds meant to pay for the specific educational activity should be provided to a department, program, or section and not to individual faculty. C. Off Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Campus - Clinical and scientific meetings sponsored by professional societies often derive a portion of their support from industry. Such support may result in inappropriate influence by industry on the content of t he meeting or on its attendees. Industry sponsorship usually adopts one of two possible forms, with different standards applying to each: 1. Partial sponsorship of a meeting otherwise run by a professional society - Icahn School of Medicine medical stude nts are encouraged to participate in the meetings of professional societies for educational purposes, and as an opportunity to showcase their own research. Nonetheless, students should be aware of the potential conflicts of interest at work in such meetings, and should be scrupulous in determining whether and how to attend and participate. 2. Full sponsorship of a meeting run by industry (including commercial education services) - Students are encouraged to pay particularly heightened attention to the conte nt and organization of such meetings and lectures. 3. Students are encouraged to assess the following points when determining the academic value of any conference, lecture, or meeting: a) Is financial support by industry is fully disclosed at the meeting b y the sponsor, and what is the extent of that support? b) Is the meeting or lecture content, including slides and written materials, is determined by the speaker(s) alone? c) Does each speaker provides a balanced assessment of therapeutic options, and promotes objective scientific and educational activities and discourse? d) Are attendees in the audience being compensated or otherwise materially rewarded for attendance through payment of travel expenses or the provision of food or gifts? e) Are gifts o f any type being distributed to attendees before, during, or after the meeting or lecture? Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 49 July 2014 f) Has each lecturer explicitly described his or her conflicts of interest, and have they been resolved? IV. Disclosure of Relationships with Industry A. All Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai faculty and lecturers must fully disclose any relevant past, present, or future relationships with industry at the beginning of each lecture to students. B. Faculty with supervisory responsibilities for students should ta ke great care to ensure that the faculty member's actual or potential conflicts of interest do not affect or appear to affect the supervision and education of the student. V. Training of Students Regarding Conflicts of Interest All students will receive training regarding actual and potential conflicts of interest in interactions with industry at all levels of education and professional practice. VI. Site Access by Sales and Marketing Representatives A. Sales and marketing representatives are not allowed any where that education or clinical care are delivered on the campus of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai unless they are providing an in -service training on devices and other equipment, and then only by appointment. This includes commercial educations services such as publishers and board review programs. B. Appointments may be made on a per visit basis at the discretion of a faculty member, his or her division or department, or designated medical school personnel issuing the invitation and with the approval of medical school administration. C. Sales and marketing representatives will be provided with a copy of these guidelines before their presentation, and will sign a statement to the effect that he or she has received and understands these guide lines. The representative will then receive a badge clearly identifying him or her. D. Marketing tools and other \"reminder\" materials will be removed entirely from any space used by sales and marketing representatives after their appointment on campus. E. Industry representatives will not approach medical students unsolicited at any point during their stay on the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai campus. Due to patient confidentiality concerns, while on campus and off, medical students are not permit ted to answer questions related to their patients or patient care, or facilitate access to any portion of medical records. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 50 July 2014 Acquired Immune Deficiency The School of Medicine in concert with the other medical schools in the state has formally stated its commitment to accept as its most fundamental responsibility the care of all patients seen in its facilities, including those who are positive for the human immune deficiency virus (HIV). This commitment extends to all faculty, residents, and students. The S chool is equally committed to the education and counseling of all health care professionals including medical students, to eliminate misperceptions concerning the risks of caring for AIDS as well as the appropriate precautions to be taken for prevention of transmission of HIV, Hepatitis -B virus and other blood -borne infections. Alcohol and Drugs Policy The following statement describes the Mount Sinai Health System's policy regarding substance abuse for all employees, which include faculty, administration, house staff, students, graduate students, fellows, bargaining and non -bargaining unit employees. Icahn School of Medicine has a significant interest in ensuring that the work environment is free from the hazards to patients, employees, and visitors that ar e created due to the unauthorized use of alcohol, drugs, or controlled substances. The illegal sale, manufacture, distribution, or unauthorized use of drugs or controlled substances off- duty whether on or off School of Medicine premises, or reporting to classes, clerkships, or laboratory research under the influence of unauthorized drugs or controlled substances may constitute grounds for immediate dismissal. The unauthorized use or possession of alcoholic beverages on Icahn School of Medicine premises or reporting to School under the influence of alcohol also may constitute grounds for immediate dismissal. The School of Medicine may in its discretion take appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination or expulsion against anyone who has vio lated the above rules. In some cases, the individual in question may be referred for counseling and treatment through the Employee Assistance Program or via Student mental Health. The School is under no obligation to refer an employee or student who has violated the above rules to the Employee Assistance Program or to any other rehabilitation program. Any employee or student who is suspected of being under the influence of any alcoholic beverage or drug while on duty and who refuses to be medically evaluate d or to release the results of such evaluation to the School of Medicine (as employer) or appropriate administrative officer of the School will be relieved from duty and will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. The Drug- Free W orkplace Act of 1988 requires Mount Sinai, as a Federal grant recipient and contractor, to certify that it will provide a drug -free workplace. This is accomplished by 1) providing to each employee or student engaged in a federal grant or contracts a copy o f The Health System 's Drug -Free Workplace policy and statement, and 2) requiring that as a condition of employment under such a grant or contract the employee will: Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 51 July 2014 Abide by the terms of this Statement; and Notify the Director of Human Resources and Labor Relations or his/her designee of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five (5) days after such conviction. A Drug- Free Awareness Program has been established to inform all employees about the dange rs of drug abuse in the workplace, The Health System 's policy of maintaining a drug -free workplace, the availability of drug counseling, rehabilitation and employee assistance programs, and the potential penalties for drug abuse violations. The Employee As sistance Program (EAP) offers professional guidance counseling and a referral service for substance abuse, as well as other concerns, to students, employees and their immediate families free of charge. For confidential information, contact EAP at 212-241-8937 Drug Testing All incoming students are required to undergo drug/alcohol screening. Subsequently, drug/alcohol testing may be requested of any student, at any time, including: When concerns about substance use issues arise. Whenever an administrative evaluation is requested (see Administrative Evaluation Section below) When any student returns from a leave of any kind. When a student self -reports a problem. Failure to undergo testing as requested will result in dismissal from the S chool . Drug/alcohol testing is conducted both to provide an environment that is safe for our patients and that promotes the highest possible level of learning and professionalism in our students. While the S chool of Medicine maintains a drug -free workplace in compliance with federal regulations, it also strives to foster an atmosphere of openness about drug and alcohol related issues. Although people often have strong preconceptions about substance use and drug/alcohol testing, such testing is done out of concern for the well- being of our students and of their current and future patients. It is therefore neither uncommon nor prejudicial. Alcohol Policy - Levinson Student Center The policy of the School of Medicine regarding alcoholic beverages in th e Patricia and Robert Levinson Student Center is to maximize student utilization of the Center while assuring that clear policies are in place. Alcohol is permitted in the Student Center at events sponsored by student organizations or Departments within Ic ahn School of Medicine under the following circumstances: A. A student -run organization that is recognized by Student Council or a medical school department is sponsoring the event. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 52 July 2014 B. No student or guest under the age of 21 will be served or permitted to consume any alcoholic beverage. C. Alcoholic beverages are not sold at the event. D. Alcohol must not be taken out of the Student Center into other areas of Mount Sinai. E. Alcohol should only be served by hired vendors with active liquor licenses or a st udent group/department that has obtained a temporary liquor license from the New York State Liquor Authority F. Serving alcoholic beverages should always be in the context of serving food and non -alcoholic beverages. F. A specific student group or departm ent must be identified as responsible for the event. G. The responsible party will monitor the event so that anyone who is clearly intoxicated is not served any more alcohol. H. If a person has become intoxicated, steps should be taken to try and help the individual sober up prior to leaving the party. I. The responsible party monitoring the event must make certain that any person that has become intoxicated will not be allowed to drive. Cab fare should be provided, if necessary, or an escort should be prov ided to ensure that the person gets home safely. K. The Department of Medical Education cannot reimburse students or student groups for alcohol purchases. Please contact the Student Affairs Manager for questions or concerns. Administrative Psychiatric Eval uation The School of Medicine reserves the right to request an administrative psychiatric evaluation at any time for any reason. The evaluation request will be discussed with the student. Specific questions will be sent to the Director of Student Mental Health or the Senior Consulting Psychiatrist for assessment. The Office for Student Affairs (Medical School) or Program Director (Graduate School) will receive a written response, in the form of a password protected electronic file, from the psychiatrist regarding the student. The response is password protected in the student's file. The purpose of the evaluation always stems from concern for the student and a request for information to help in academic counseling. Specific recommendations may be fo rwarded to the School administration, which can then impose certain requirements on the student. Examples (not all inclusive) might include required intervals for psychotherapy, mandated drug testing, or repeat administrative evaluations. Refusal to co mply with an administrative evaluation or with recommendations stemming from an administrative evaluation is Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 53 July 2014 grounds for dismissal. These evaluations are never included in the MSPE or shared with outside entities unless legally subpoenaed. Harassment Po licy I. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE Harassment has become an increasingly prominent national concern in the workplace and in academic institutions. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai regards any behavior that is harassing, discriminatory, or abusive as a violation of the standards of conduct required of all persons associated with the academic mission of the institution. The ideal of American medical, graduate and postgraduate education is to create an environment that nurtures respect and collegiality between educator and student. In the teacher -student relationship, each party has certain legitimate expectations of the other. For example, the learner can expect that the teacher will provide instruction, guidance, inspiration, and leadership in learning. The teacher expects the learner to make an appropriate professional investment of energy and intellect to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to become an effective physician or scientist. The social relationships required in the achievement o f this academic ideal - mentor, peer, professional, staff - require the active trust of partnership, not the dependence of authoritarian dominance and submission Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is responsible for providing a work and academic environment free of sexual and other forms of harassment. The institution may pursue any complaint of harassment known to it in order to achieve this goal. A Grievance Committee (the \"Committee\") was established in 1992 to serve as an educational resource to the medical school community on issues relevant to harassment and to address complaints of sexual harassment and other forms of harassment and abuse as defined below. Complaints about implementation of school policies concerning appointment, promotio n, and distribution of resources, including notification requirements associated with these policies, will not be addressed by this Committee unless they involve, in addition to those complaints, an allegation of harassment or abuse as defined below. The Committee (and an appointed Investigative and Hearing Board (the \"Board\") under Paragraph IV.C.2. below, if any) may only consider complaints of harassment and abuse brought by any faculty member, medical or graduate student, house staff or postdoctoral fellow against any other such member of the School community. Complaints by and against other employees of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai will be handled by other appropriate existing grievance mechanisms (e.g., those available through Human Reso urces). The Committee may act (at the Committee's discretion) before or after other action(s) an individual may take to exercise his/her rights both within and outside the institution. The Committee will attempt, whenever possible, to emphasize mediation and conciliation. It will rely on discreet inquiry and trust in dealing with complaints that are brought for its consideration. Confidentiality will be maintained to the maximum extent possible consistent with the need to investigate complain ts and with the requirements of the law. Full cooperation with the Committee and an appointed Board, if any, is required of all members of the community. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 54 July 2014 To ensure an environment in which education, work, research, and discussion are not corrupted by a buse, discrimination and harassment, the following statement has been created to educate members of the academic community about what constitutes harassment and about the mechanism for the receipt, consideration, and resolution of complaints. II. DEFINITI ONS OF UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR Certain behaviors are inherently destructive to the relationships that are required in a community organized to provide medical and graduate education. Behaviors such as violence, sexual and other harassment, abuses of power and discrimination (based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, veteran status, age, disability, citizenship, marital status, genetic predisposition or any other characteristic protected by law) will not be tolerated. A. Sexual Harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and/or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: 1) Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an indivi dual's employment or academic success. 2) Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for employment or academic decisions affecting such an individual. 3) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interferin g with an individual's work or academic performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work or academic environment. Sexual harassment is a violation of institutional policy and of city, state and federal laws. Sexual harassment need no t be intentional to violate this policy. Examples of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to : Sexual assault Inappropriate sexual advances, propositions or demands Unwelcome physical contact Inappropriate persistent public statements or display s of sexually explicit or offensive material which is not legitimately related to employment duties, course content or research Threats or insinuations, which lead the victim to believe that acceptance or refusal of sexual favors, will affect his/her reput ation, education, employment or advancement Derogatory comments relating to gender or sexual orientation In general, though not always, sexual harassment occurs in circumstances where the harasser has some form of power or authority over the life of the harassed. As such, sexual harassment does not fall within the range of personal private relationships. Although a variety of consensual sexual relationships are possible between medical supervisors and trainees, such relationships raise ethical concer ns because of inherent inequalities in the status and power that supervisors wield in relation to trainees. Despite the consensual nature of the relationship, the potential for sexual exploitation exists. Even if no professional relationship currently exists between a supervisor and a trainee, entering into such Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 55 July 2014 a relationship could become problematic in light of the future possibility that the supervisor may unexpectedly assume a position of responsibility for the trainee. B. Discrimination is defin ed as actions on the part of an individual , group or institution that treat another individual or group differently because of race, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion, veteran status, age, disability, citizenship, marital status, genetic predisposition or any other characteristic protected by law. Discrimination or harassment on the basis of these characteristics violates federal, state, and city laws and is prohibited and covered by this policy. C. Abuse is defined, for purpose s of this policy, as behavior that is viewed by society and by the academic community as exploitative or punishing without appropriate cause. It is particularly objectionable when it involves the abuse of authority. Examples of behavior which may be abusive include, but are not limited to : Habitual conduct or speech that creates an intimidating, demeaning, degrading, hostile, or otherwise seriously offensive working or educational environment Physical punishment Repeated episodes of verbal punishment (e.g. public humiliation, threats and intimidation) Removal of privileges without appropriate cause Grading or evaluations used to punish rather than to evaluate objective performance Assigning tasks solely for punishment rather than educational purposes Repeated demands to perform personal services outside job description Intentional neglect or intentional lack of communication Requirements of individuals to perform unpleasant tasks that are entirely irrelevant to their education and employment that other s are not also asked to perform Constructive criticism, as part of the learning process, does not constitute harassment. To be most effective, negative feedback should be delivered in a private setting that fosters free discussion and behavioral change. III. GRIEVANCE COMMITTEE A. Purview The Committee is charged with addressing any complaint of harassment or abuse brought by any member of the faculty, medical or graduate student, house staff officer or postdoctoral research fellow against any other such member of the school community. B. Composition of the Committee The Committee will consist of at least 22 members. Among these will be 2 with counseling experience, 2 medical students, 2 graduate students, 2 house staff, 2 faculty with adm inistrative appointments, and 2 research post doctoral fellows. Faculty members of the Committee will be representative of both basic science and clinical, junior, and senior faculty. Every effort will be made to Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 56 July 2014 have the Committee reflect the full div ersity of the medical school population. The Chairperson of the Committee (the \"Chairperson\") shall be a faculty member with experience in counseling and who does not have an administrative appointment. All members of the Committee, including the Chairperson, will be appointed by the Dean after consultation with relevant groups in the School. Faculty will serve staggered 3-year renewable terms; students, postdoctoral fellows and house officers will serve renewable 1 -year terms. IV. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES A. Any member of the faculty, any medical or graduate student, house officer or postdoctoral research fellow who believes that he or she has been harassed or abused by any other such member of the School community may contact any member of the Committee or the Chairperson to seek advice, or may submit a written complaint to the Committee. The Committee member contacted can discuss the matter with the complainant, advise the complainant of his/her alternatives in pursuing the complaint, including, if the complainant agrees, (and where permitted by law), helping the complainant to resolve the complaint informally without revealing the complainant's name. Such help may include, but is not limited to, assisting the complainant in drafting a letter to the alleged offender asking that he/she stops the behavior, or coaching the complainant in preparation for a conversation with the alleged offender. The complainant may ask the Committee member to meet directly with the person accused to seek a resolution. If the complaint includes an alleged violation of law, the Committee member initially contacted must bring the complaint to the full Committee, the complaint must be fully documented and investigated, and a report made to the Dean. B. Upon request of t he complainant to the Committee member originally contacted, or upon receipt of written complaints to the Committee, or when required by law, the complaint, with the names of the complainant, respondent and department withheld, will be discussed by the Com mittee at its next regular meeting. C. Following discussion of the complaint, the Committee has 2 options: 1. It can decide that even if the allegation is true, it does not constitute harassment or abuse. The complainant will be notified of the fin ding and can be offered guidance and/or assistance in resolving the matter, or be referred to another, more appropriate venue, such as Human Resources, the Faculty Relations Committee or a Tenure Review Committee to pursue the complaint. 2. It can decide that the allegation is sufficiently serious to warrant further investigation. Unless previously submitted, the complainant will be requested to submit a full written account of the complaint. Upon receipt of the written complaint, the Chairperson will appoint a five -member Board and two alternates. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 57 July 2014 The Chairperson will serve as chair of the Board (or, in case of conflict of interest or other inability to serve, appoint another Committee member) and will appoint at least 4 additional individuals and a t least 2 alternates to consider the complaint. Students, postdoctoral fellows, and house staff members are to be excluded from the Board in cases involving a faculty member alleging harassment by another faculty member. In cases involving a student, p ostdoctoral fellow or house staff (either as an accuser or accused), at least one of the members of the Board will be from the same group. Each Board will have at least one member with experience in counseling, and at least 3 faculty. D. Upon selecti on of the Board, the complainant will be notified of the names of Board members, and will have 48 hours from receipt of such notification to challenge, in writing, any member for cause. The respondent will be notified that a complaint has been brought against him/her, the name of the complainant, the nature of the complaint and the names of the members of the Board. The respondent shall also have 48 hours from receipt of notification to challenge, in writing, any member of the Board for cause. In the event of a challenge, the Chairperson will decide on the merits and replace Board members if necessary. In the event that the Chairperson is unable to appoint a sufficient number of members not disqualified for cause, the Dean will appoint additional mem bers. E. Investigative and Hearing Board Procedures. The preliminary stages of the investigation may consist of meetings of one or more members of the Board with the complainant, respondent and other members of the community who might have relevant information. In the event that preliminary meetings have been held, all information obtained in these meetings will be shared with the entire Board. In all meetings, confidentiality will be stressed. The respondent will receive the full written complain t with the supporting documentation provided by the complainant to the Board and will be afforded two weeks to provide a written response. This response will be distributed to the Board and provided to the complainant. The Board will then hold one or m ore hearings, which the complainant and respondent will attend, either individually or together, along with any other witnesses the Board deems relevant to the complaint. At the hearing, each of the parties may be accompanied by an advisor, who is a memb er of the Mount Sinai community, but who is not a lawyer , and who will not function as an advocate during the hearing. At the close of the hearing(s), the Board will deliberate the findings without the presence of either the complainant or the respondent. Upon concluding its deliberations, the Board will vote on whether or not there has been a violation of this policy based on a majority vote. Recommendations for remedial actions will be discussed. A full report will be drafted, including the findin gs, vote and recommendations of the majority. It will then be submitted to the Dean. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 58 July 2014 The Board's written report will include: a. A determination that a violation of this policy did or did not take place b. A listing of its findings of fact c. A summary of the written submissions of the parties d. A summary of testimony at the hearing e. A summary of evidence gathered during the investigation f. The conclusions it has drawn from this material g. Its recommendations for action to be taken by the Dean. h. The B oard may recommend sanctions based on the severity of the offense. i. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, verbal reprimand, written reprimand, change in job responsibilities, suspension, discharge, and expulsion. The Board and/or the Committee may, at their discretion, modify the Grievance Procedures depending on the nature of a particular complaint. F. Dean's Review The Dean may accept or reject conclusions and/or recommendations of the Board. However, in the event the Dean does not accept ei ther the Board's conclusions or its recommendations, he/she will meet with the Board to discuss the reasons for the rejection before recording a final decision on the matter. The Dean will convey his/her decision in writing to the complainant, respondent and the Board. V. PROTECTION FROM RETALIATION All individuals involved in registering a complaint, serving as representatives for the complainant or respondent, as witnesses, or on the Committee will be free from any and all retaliation or reprisal or threats thereof. This principle applies with equal force after a complaint has been adjudicated. Upon submission of a complaint or threat of retaliation, the Committee will review the facts and recommend appropriate action. VI. REEVALUATION OF PROC EDURES The Committee will review the grievance procedures periodically. Proposed changes, approved by a majority of the Committee, must be reviewed and approved by the Office of the General Counsel before being implemented. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 59 July 2014 Student Mistreatment Guideline Preamble Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is dedicated to providing its students, residents, faculty, staff and patients with an environment of respect, dignity and support. All members of the Icahn School of Medicine community are resp onsible for protecting student rights as specified in our Student and Faculty Codes of Conduct, the oaths we take, and institutional policy. Educators (defined broadly to include anyone in a teaching role, including faculty, residents, fellows, nurses, staff, and students) bear significant responsibility in creating and maintaining this atmosphere. As role models and evaluators, educators must practice appropriate professional behavior toward, and in the presence of, students, who are in a particularly vuln erable position due to the formative nature of their status. This guideline, therefore, supplements the institutional policy on harassment and grievances, will assist in developing and maintaining optimal learning environments, and encourages educators and students alike to accept their responsibilities as representatives of Icahn School of Medicine in their interactions with their colleagues, patients, and staff. Description of Mistreatment Mistreatment interferes with the learning environment, adversely impacts the student- educator relationship, and has the potential for disrupting patient care and research. Inappropriate and unacceptable behaviors promote an atmosphere in which mistreatment is accepted and perpetuated in medical education and training. While the perception of mistreatment may differ between individuals, examples of mistreatment of students include, but are not limited to: Intentional neglect or marginalization (e.g., ignoring, speaking down to, yelling at, ridiculing) Insults or inappropriately harsh language in speaking to or about a student Berating, belittling, humiliating or intimidating behavior Threat of physical harm or physical punishment (e.g. hitting, slapping, kicking) Asking to perform personal services (e.g., shopping, babysitting, picking up food) Threat of receiving a poor evaluation/grade for reasons other than course/clerkship performance Threat of altering authorship on a publication for reasons other than proper contribution Disregard for patient or student safety by requiring a student to perform a procedure or engage in patient care without adequate supervision. Sexual harassment, including offensive remarks, being asked to exchange sexual favors f or grades or other awards, or being subjected to sexual advances Discrimination or harassment based on race, color, national origin, gender, sexual preference, age, religion, disability, marital status, military status, genetic predisposition, being the v ictim of spousal abuse, or based on any other characteristic protected by law. Such actions are contrary to the good will, trust, and compassion central to the learning culture and working environment in an academic medical center. These actions cannot be tolerated. The sources of mistreatment include, but are not limited to research, preclinical, and clinical faculty, fellows, residents, post -docs, nurses, allied health care workers, fellow students and patients. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 60 July 2014 The Student Mistreatment Resource Panel I. The School will form a student panel to (1) serve as a sounding board for students with concerns about mistreatment and (2) assist in school- wide education about this topic. II. Members of the panel will be elected by their peers annually. III. The St udent Mistreatment Resource Panel will be comprised of: One (1) medical student at the MS IV level* One (1) medical student at the MS III level* One (1) medical student at the MS II level* One (1) medical student at the MS I level* One (1) MD/PhD student* Two (2) graduate students* One (1) scholarly year student, who will act as chair of the Panel* Two (2) Faculty Advisors who are the medical school ombudspersons. *At least one (1) student member of the Panel will also sit on th e Grievance Committee. IV. Panel members will: Serve as a sounding board for students with concerns about mistreatment in the educational environment. Assist in educating the Icahn School of Medicine community about mistreatment as outlined in the sect ion entitled \"Dissemination.\" Meet with the Dean for Medical Education, Dean of the Graduate School and other medical school leadership on a biannual basis at the end of each semester. At that time, the panel's de -identified records will be reviewed in order to improve this guideline and/or the program. If the panel or Deans deem it necessary, additional meetings may be scheduled. Update this guideline and programming based on the biannual review. Sign a statement detailing their understanding of the ex pectation of confidentiality in dealing with mistreatment related concerns and agreeing to serve on the panel for a one year term. Recognize potential conflicts of interest: if a panel member has a potential conflict of interest that relates to a situation brought before the group (for example, a strong personal relationship with someone involved in the situation) the panel member must recuse himself or herself when the group learns about or discusses the situation. Likewise a student bringing a situation t o the panel may request that one of the members not participate if there is a potential conflict of interest. The student should make this request to the chair of the panel or the ombudspersons. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 61 July 2014 IV. One (1) member of the panel will act as secretary and maintain de -identified records which include but are not limited to: All mistreatment concerns brought before the panel Next steps taken on mistreatment concerns (i.e. sent to Grievance Committee, spoke to Dean, etc.) All Student Mistreatment Resource Pa nel records will remain anonymous and only de -identified data will be presented at biannual review meetings. V. Student mistreatment concerns will be handled according to the following process: Students may report a concern either in person directly to a student member of the panel or by emailing a member of the panel. The panel will meet to discuss the case. Depending upon the severity and complexity of the complaint, the panel may deem it neces sary or desirable for the student to meet with the group in order for the panel to ask questions or make suggestions. Depending upon the severity or complexity of the mistreatment, or at the request of the affected student, the panel may refer the case to an appropriate group or department at Icahn School of Medicine . When this occurs, the Dean for Medical Education and/or Dean of the Graduate School will also be notified. At any time during the process, if the panel becomes concerned about an immediate threat to the safety or well- being of the complainant, alleged aggressor, or any person at Icahn School of Medicine or in the community, the panel will notify the Dean for Medical Education and/or Dean of the Graduate School. Dissemination To promote a l earning environment respectful of all individuals, Icahn School of Medicine will publicize the concern about student mistreatment and this panel's existence across the institution. Education is a cornerstone in the prevention of student mistreatment. An on -going effort will be made to inform all individuals involved in student education about the appropriate treatment of students and of this guideline. To that end, the following notification mechanisms will be utilized: Medical Students : A discussion of mi streatment and our guidelines will occur each year during year, course, and clerkship orientations. Each course and clerkship director will include this guideline in their course and clerkship materials. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 62 July 2014 Graduate Students : A discussion of mistreatment and our guidelines will occur during Orientation for first year students. Faculty, Residents and Fellows : This guideline will be sent each year from the Dean's office to all Course and Clerkship Directors and all MTA directors, who will help disseminate the g uideline to those involved in medical student education. Protection from Retaliation Retaliation against individuals who bring forward complaints of mistreatment (including but not limited to adverse effects on student evaluation) is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated. Affirmative Action Policy It is the policy of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai that all decisions regarding educational and employment opportunities and performance are made on the basis of merit and without discrimination because of race, gender, color, creed, age, religion, national origin, citizenship, disability, veteran status, marital status, sexual orientation, genetic predisposition, or any other characteristic protected by law. In keeping with our continuing e fforts to achieve a broadening of the representation of women and minority groups throughout the medical school, we have: A. Developed an Affirmative Action Program which details actions designed to realize the School's commitment to equal educational and emp loyment opportunities. B. Insured our compliance with Federal, State and Local laws and regulations implementing equal opportunity objectives by meeting the spirit as well as the letter of the law and contractual requirements. We cannot over -emphasize our com mitment to the realization of these goals. Every decision affecting faculty, house staff, fellows, graduate students, employees, and medical students and other members of the medical school community rests solely on demonstrably valid criteria of merit, co mpetence and experience. Additional information concerning Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 's Affirmative Action Program can be found through the Human Resources Department of The Mount Sinai Health System. Mount Sinai Health System Social Media Guideline Social media are internet -based applications which support and promote the exchange of user -developed content. Some current examples include Facebook, Wikipedia, and YouTube. Posting personal images, experiences and information on these kinds of public sites poses a set of unique challenges for all members of the Mount Sinai community, including employees, faculty, house staff, fellows, volunteers and students (collectively \"Personnel\"). All personnel have responsib ility to the institution regardless of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 63 July 2014 where or when they post something that may reflect poorly on Mount Sinai. Mount Sinai is committed to supporting your right to interact knowledgeably and socially; however these electronic interactions have a potent ial impact on patients, colleagues, Mount Sinai, and future employers' opinions of you. The principal aim of this Guideline is to identify your responsibilities to Mount Sinai in relation to social media and to help you represent yourself and Mount Sinai in a responsible and professional manner. Guideline The following Guideline outlines appropriate standards of conduct related to all electronic information (text, image or auditory) that is created or posted externally on social media sites by Personnel affiliated with Mount Sinai. Examples include, but are not limited to: text messages, media messaging service (MMS), Twitter\u00ae, Facebook\u00ae, Linked -In\u00ae, YouTube\u00ae, and all other social networks, personal and organizational websites, blogs, wikis, and similar entities. This Guideline applies to future media with similar implications. It also applies whether Personnel are posting to: Mount Sinai -hosted sites; social media in which one's affiliation is known, identified, or presumed; or a self- hosted site, wher e the views and opinions expressed are not intended to represent the official views of Mount Sinai. Reference to Other Policies All existing policies of The Mount Sinai Health System apply to Personnel in connection with their social media activities . A list of relevant policies is included at the end of this Guideline. Best Practices Everyone who participates in social media activities should understand and follow these simple but important Best Practices: Take Responsibility and Use Good Judgment. You are responsible for the material you post on personal blogs or other social media. Be courteous, respectful, and thoughtful about how other Personnel may perceive or be affected by postings. Incomplete, inaccurate, inappropriate, threatening, harassing or poorly worded postings may be harmful to others. They may damage relationships, undermine Mount Sinai's brand or reputation, discourage teamwork, and negatively impact the institution's commitment to pat ient care, education, research, and community service. Think Before You Post. Anything you post is highly likely to be permanently connected to you and your reputation through Internet and email archives. Future employers can often have access to this in formation and may use it to evaluate you. Take great care and be thoughtful before placing your identifiable comments in the public domain. Protect Patient Privacy . Disclosing information about patients without written permission, including photographs or potentially identifiable information, is strictly prohibited. These rules also apply to deceased patients and to posts in the secure section of your Facebook page that is accessible by approved friends only. Protect Your Own Privacy . Make sure you un derstand how the privacy policies and security features work on the sites where you are posting material. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 64 July 2014 Respect Work Commitments . Ensure that your blogging, social networking, and other external media activities do not interfere with your work commitment s. Identify Yourself . If you communicate in social media about Mount Sinai, disclose your connection with Mount Sinai and your role at the Health System . Use good judgment and strive for accuracy in your communications. False and unsubstantiated claims , and inaccurate or inflammatory postings may create liability for you. Use a Disclaimer . Where your connection to Mount Sinai is apparent, make it clear that you are speaking for yourself and not on behalf of Mount Sinai. A disclaimer, such as, \"The views expressed on this [blog; website] are my own and do not reflect the views of my employer,\" may be appropriate. Respect Copyright and Fair Use Laws . For Mount Sinai's protection as well as your own, it is critical that you show proper respect for the law s governing copyright and fair use of copyrighted material owned by others, including Mount Sinai's own copyrights and brands. Protect Proprietary Information . Do not share confidential or proprietary information that may compromise Mount Sinai's business practices or security. Similarly, do not share information in violation of any laws or regulations. Seek Expert Guidance . Consult with the Marketing & Communications Department if you have any questions about the appropriateness of materials you plan to publish or if you require clarification on whether specific information has been publicly disclosed before you disclose it publicly. Social media may generate interest from the press. If you are contacted by a member of the media about a Mount Sinai -related blog posting or Health System information of any kind, contact the Press Office, a division of the Marketing & Communications Department, at 212 -241-9200 or newsmedia@mssm.edu Failure to abide by Mount Sinai policies may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination or expulsion. Applicable Policies: These policies include, but are not limited to: Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) or Confidential Mount Sinai Materials ; Computer Use Policy; Use of Mount Sinai's Trademarks and Proprietary Information; Electronic Communications; Confidentiality of the Medical Record; Camera and Video Recorder Use; Portable Electronic Devices; Human Resources Policies 13.5 (Electronic Mail/Email) and 13.6 (Internet Use); and all professionalism policies and codes of conduct. Policies not listed above that are in the Human Resources Manual, the Faculty Handbook, the Housestaff Manual, the Student Handbook and the Bylaws of the Hospital Staff also apply. The following are fictional use -case examples of social media and blogging activities and an explanation of their appropriateness as per the Mount Sinai Health System Social Media Guideline: Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 65 July 2014 1. A patient attempts to \"friend\" an attending physician on Facebook. This is almost always inappropriate, unless the doctor -patient relationship has ended. Even after the doctor -patient relationship has ended, it would be inappro priate to discuss health -related information. (Best Practice 3) 2. A patient comments on a Mount Sinai physician's blog and discloses protected health information with the expectation that the Mount Sinai physician will continue the discussion. Any health -related discussions by email with patients require a written consent. Similarly, social media discussion with a patient should not directly address health concerns of individual patients. (Best Practice 3) 3. A medical student \"twitters\" that he just finishe d rounds with the residents on a patient and describes the clinical findings of that patient. It is difficult to be certain that information disclosed in the Twitter\u00ae post is not identifiable to that particular patient. The best type of posting would i nclude very general information. Other posts by the same student could indicate his/her medical school and current rotation, leading to circumstances that indirectly identify the patient, such as by naming a very rare disease. (Best Practice 3) 4. A medical student writes in her blog, naming an attending physician who did minimal teaching on rounds and recommending that other students not take clinical electives with that physician. Legitimate critique of an educational activity is appropriate, so long as professionalism is maintained. There are more effective and less public mechanisms for relaying this type of information, and the student may be counseled accordingly. (Best Practices 1, 2) 5. A graduate student posts to his \"wall\" on Facebook that half of the class was sleeping during Dr. X's lecture on biostatistics. This is very similar to the use case above. (Best Practices 1, 2) 6. A pediatric resident posts (on her Facebook wall) a picture of a baby who was just discharged from her service, expressing j oy, best wishes to the family, and congratulating everyone involved in this excellent patient outcome. Without written patient/representative consent, this is a clear violation of patient confidentiality, even if the patient is not named. (Best Practice 3) 7. A laboratory technician blogs that the laboratory equipment he is using should have been replaced years ago and is unreliable. The public disclosure of such information increases the liability for the Health System and is clearly unprofessional. There are legitimate and confidential mechanisms for improving quality at the Health System . (Best Practices 1, 2) 8. A graduate student wearing a Mount Sinai t -shirt is tagged in a photo taken at a local bar and posted on a friend's Facebook page. The graduate student is clearly inebriated. The two issues are that: (1) the Mount Sinai logo identifies the affiliation to the institution; and (2) the unprofessional behavior of the student is available for all to see, including future employers and potential patients of Mount Sinai. The graduate student did not post the photo, but should do everything possible to have the photo removed and remove the tagging link to the student's own Facebook page. (Best Practices 2, 4) Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 66 July 2014 9. A post doctoral fellow blogs that her laboratory technician wears too much cologne, has terrible taste in clothes, and takes overly long lunch breaks. This is an inappropriate forum and set of comments and demonstrates unprofessional behavior by the post -doctoral fellow. There are legitimate and confidential mechanisms for addressing valid concerns in the workplace. (Best Practices 1, 2) 10. An oncology nurse practitioner uses an alias and blogs that Mount Sinai has the lowest bone marrow transplantation complication rate in the world. This may be a violation of Federal Trade Commission regulations that prohibit false or unsubstantiated claims, and does not disclose the employee's material relationship to Mount Sinai. (Best Practice 6) 11. An applicant to the School of Medicine is given access to a n Icahn School of Medicine blog to comment on the experience. The applicant writes that another medical school in NYC is obviously more prestigious and has better housing. Mount Sinai has no recourse against non - affiliated individuals. The administrator of the blog should have established policies and procedures for editorial procedures. If the blog posting meets these editorial guidelines, then the blog posting should remain. It is likely that others will debate the original comment and place Icahn School of Medicine 's reputation and housing status in context. 12. A medical student creates a social media website to discuss medical knowledge (e.g., \"Cardiology Interest Group\" on Facebook\u00ae) This is a learning community environment, in which medical knowledge is exchanged, shared and discussed. While the goal is laudable, there are still risks. A disclaimer is necessary, since postings may be incorrect, taken out of context, or improperly referenced. The moderator should take precautions to prevent the posting of information potentially identifiable to a particular patient. (Best Practices 1, 3 ,6, 7) Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 67 July 2014 Student Government The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Student Council is composed of representatives from each of the four medical school years as well as from each Graduate School program. Each class elects four students to serve as class representatives as well as 1 -2 students to serve on the following subcommittees: Academic Technolo gy, Athletic, Community Service, Executive Curriculum/AAMC, Health, Housing and Security Student Lounge, Social, and Mistreatment. The Student Council considers all academic, financial, and other matters related to being a student in the School of Medici ne and the Graduate School. Elections for student council take place in April, except for first -year elections, which take place in August after students arrive on campus. At the first meeting following elections, the offices of President, Vice - President , Treasurer, and Secretary will be elected for the following year.

Recreation Student Council has a committee for social activities and one for athletic activities. Each committee is composed of one elected student from each of the four classes. At the beginning of the academic year, follo wing discussion with their respective classes, the Committee members formulate a program of activities for the entire academic year and allocate the necessary funds. Individual students interested in a particular activity should consult appropriate class r epresentative.

Y-Passes are available through a link on Blackboard. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 70 July 2014 Academ ic Requirements Technical Standards for Candidates for MD Degree The education of a physician encompasses a preparatory phase in college, a rigorous undergraduate medical professional education leading to the MD degree, postgraduate or residency training and finally, lifelong continuing education after the conclusion of formal training. The MD degree awarded at the completion of the undergraduate medical educational process certifies that the individual has acquired a broad base of knowledge and skills req uisite for the practice of medicine. Toward this end, the School of Medicine requires that the educational process prepare an individual to be a physician. The educational process at the School of Medicine is structured to allow the student to achieve this general goal and is in accord with the objectives defined by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), the established agency in the United States for accreditation of medical schools. Admissions standards of the School of Medicine, therefore, are rigorous and exacting. Admission may be extended only to those who are best qualified to meet the standards set forth below. Candidates for the MD degree must have abilities and skills in five domains: observation, communication, motor, conceptual/integr ative and quantitative, behavioral and social. Technological or other accommodations can be made for some disabilities in certain of these areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. Use of an intermediary for t he collection of a patient's history, including but not limited to sign -language interpretation or use of technological devices, is acceptable. Nevertheless, the candidate must be able to perform a full physical examination, must consistently, quickly an d accurately integrate all information received by whatever sense(s) employed, and must have the intellectual ability to learn, gather information, communicate, and integrate, analyze and synthesize data. Observa tion The candidate must be able to observe d emonstrations and experiments in the basic sciences including, but not limited to, physiologic and pharmacologic demonstrations in animals, microbiologic cultures and microscopic studies of microorganisms and tissues in normal and pathologic states. A cand idate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation requires the functional use of the senses of vision and somatic sensation. Communication A candidate should be able to elicit information; describe changes in m ood, activity and posture; and perceive nonverbal communications in interactions with patients. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively, professionally, and sensitively with patients. In addition, the candidate must be able to communicate effec tively, professionally, and efficiently with all members of the health care team in both immediate and recorded modes. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 71 July 2014 Motor Candidates should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion and oth er diagnostic maneuvers. A candidate should be able to do basic laboratory tests (urinalysis, CBC, etc.), carry out diagnostic procedures (proctoscopy, paracentesis, etc.) and evaluate EKGs and X -rays. A candidate should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of emergency treatment reasonably required of physicians are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration of intravenous medication, the application of pressure to stop bleeding, the opening of obstructed airways, the suturing of simple wounds and the performance of simple obstetrical maneuvers. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium and functional use of the sense s of touch and vision. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities These abilities include measurement, calculations, reasoning, analysis and synthesis. Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of physicians, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three -dimensional relationships and understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes Candidates must possess the emotional health required for full use of their intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, display flexibility and learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical pro blems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest and motivation are all personal qualities that should be assessed during the admissions and education process. Candidates for the MD degree must gather data f rom, communicate with, and care for, in a non - judgmental way, persons whose culture, sexual orientation, or spiritual beliefs are different from their own. Throughout the clinical curriculum, students must be able to consistently perform a complete histo ry and physical exam on any patient regardless of the patient's race, color, national origin, marital status, military status, citizenship, disability, genetic predisposition, religion, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, age, or sexual preference. Adherence to these technical standards is designed to ensure that the MD degree attests to the basic acquisition of general knowledge in all fields of medicine, as well as the acquisition of the basic skills necessary for medical practice.

Academic Requirements for the Class of 2017 and Beyond Students beginning with the class of 2017 will participate in a curriculum that includes a research requirement to be completed by graduation. Students can fulfill t he requirement by submitting a first author abstract approved by a mentor and a track advisor to Medical Student Research Day and presenting the project as a poster or an oral talk in Year 1, Year 2, Year 3, or Year 4. Student Evaluation of Medical Education There are multiple opportunities offered students to comment on the quality of their medical education program: within course /clerkship feedback sessions, mandatory end of course and clerkship evaluations, focus groups and school -wide surveys seeking comments on aspects of the medical school. The AAMC conducts an anonymous Matriculation Survey (MSQ) and an anonymous Graduation Questionnai re (GQ) that all students are requested to complete. Students also elect representatives who act as intermediaries between class members and course/clerkship directors . We routinely convene focus groups to address curriculum, student life, and other topi cs. The following policy has been implemented to ensure timely, professional, and useful responses from students regarding course evaluations: If a student has not completed the mandatory course evaluation 2 weeks after the last day of the course, the stud ent will receive an Incident report . Students have 4 weeks to complete clerkship evaluations after which non -compliant students will receive an Incident report . Students must complete all evaluations for all courses and clerkships in order to be promoted to the next academic year or to graduate. This includes evaluations of faculty and preceptors in those courses and clerkships. All evaluations are completed on line, via E*value , and are anonymous. Please know that your feedback is very importan t to us, is read carefully and taken very seriously. Comments regarding clerkships, sites and educators that are considered to be unprofessional (inappropriate, threatening or harassing) will be voided and forwarded to Curricular and Student Affairs for review. Although your identity will remain anonymous to Curricular and Student Affairs, you will be contacted by E*value and asked to reconsider your thoughts and to rewrite them in a constructive manner, one which will be helpful to both the course/clerkship director and faculty members. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 79 July 2014 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 80 July 2014 Academic Programs and Requirements Year 1 Courses and Requirements Fall Semester Art & Science of Medicine Year 1 Structures InFocus 1 Molecul ar, Cellular and Genomic Foundations Spring Semester Art & Science of Medicine Year 1 Immunology Pathology InFocus 2 Physiology Medical Microbiology Year 2 Courses and Requirements Fall Semester Art & Science of Medicine Year 2 Brain & Behavior InFocus 3 Cardiovascular Pathophysiology Pulmonary Spring Semester Art & Science of Medicine Year 2 Gastrointestinal- Sexual & Reproductive Health Renal Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 81 July 2014 Milestones We have developed a learning roadmap for Icahn School of Medicine students to support their achievement of outcomes related to scholarly work, career planning, skill development in areas critical for science and practice in the 21st century, and compliance expectations. Using the mi lestones for each year, students can direct their planning and scheduling, track their sequential achievement of milestones, and obtain guidance and mentorship as they progress through the academic program. The Milestones Map on each class year's Mileston e organization on the Blackboard website provides detailed descriptions for each milestone, including event dates, deadlines, and the exact steps necessary to complete and receive credit for the milestone. Depending on specific paths that students may ch oose to enter, some assigned milestones may change as the academic year progresses. Information may also be updated on the Milestone Map as a deadline approaches. For this reason, weekly Update and Reminder emails will be sent out each Friday with the most current Milestone information for upcoming tasks. The completion of Milestones is also tracked via the class year's Milestone organization. Students are responsible for tracking their own completion of some Milestones, while the Milestones coor dinator will upload and track the completion of other Milestones. All of this is described in a detailed manner on the Milestones Map. Missing a Milestone deadline has professional consequences, such as falling behind on the required Scholarly Product, n ot receiving funding for Summer Research Projects, etc. If a Milestone Deadline passes without completion, the student may receive an Incident Report. Years 1 and 2 Nexus Learning and Experiences First - and second -year students will not take courses or pursue activities for elective credit, but rather for their own professional development and learning. Nexus Learning Nexus Learning comprises a diverse range of courses geared towards first - and second -year medical students; the offerings build on the required curriculum and allow students to gain new insights, knowledge, and skills to enhance their practice of medicine. Students can explore topics in the humanities as well as courses in the sciences. While Nexus Learning courses are not for credit, st udents are strongly encouraged to take at least one of these courses. Nexus Learning is an opportunity to deepen knowledge in particular area of interest or discover an entirely new discipline, as well as to engage with faculty and students with these shar ed interests. Selecting and R egistering for a Nexus Learning C ourse: From the Nexus Learning list online (https://sap.mssm.edu/elective/courses/courses_1_2.cfm) select the course you wish to take Email the program coordinator directly to sign up for the course Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 82 July 2014 Students who have met the minimum requirements of the Nexus Learning course, which are set by the individual course directors, should track their participation in their student portfolio. The Nexus Learning courses are not formally graded but rathe r a voluntary experience in keeping with Icahn School of Medicine's philosophy. Experiences Students in Y ears 1 and 2 are encouraged to pursue the following types of activities and experiences outside of coursework: research, teaching/education, service, extra -curricular and school leadership positions, clinical shadowing, ethics and humanities, and global health. We encourage students to craft, pursue and then track these types of experiences on their own. The tracking is done via the student portfolio that is open and fluid, and ultimately serves as the basis for the student's Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). Students are encouraged to track their experiences throughout medical school by title, position, dates, and time spent and to keep them updated each semester. \"Experiences\" are listed to give students ideas about outside- of-class opportunities available. The level at which a student would pursue such activities will be reflected on the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSP E) and factored into his/her overall performance at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Every student is encouraged to become involved in a community service project of their choosing. This is not a formally graded requirement but rather a voluntary e xperience in keeping with Icahn School of Medicine's philosophy. Year 3 and 4 General Clerkship Requirements Student Work Hours Policy Clerkship Directors disseminate the work hours policy to clerkship faculty and house staff at Mount Sinai and affiliate s. The policy is outlined below and is also noted on the clerkship cards. Site evaluations allow students to share their experiences relat ed to work hours . If a student is required to be on overnight call, then the student is required to be off duty the next morning by 9 am If no overnight call is required on the clerkship, then evening call ends at 9 pm and the student is expected to return the next morning (no earlier than 5 am on any service) In hospital on -call frequency: no more than every third night Minimum time off between duty hours: must have 8 hours off between shifts including after a 24 - hour shift. Competencies in Clinical Skills Students must attain competency in certain technical skills prior to completion of medical school. The attainment of proficiency in skills is crucial to a student's ability to function as a successful intern. Part 405 of the New York State Hospital Code requires that we document the skill competencies of our students. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 83 July 2014 Students must be provided direct supervision of skills until proficiency can be demonstrated. There are certain procedures that students cannot do without direct supervision. There are FOUR (4) categories of procedures: Core/ Required Technical Competencies : \"Core Competencies\" are those for which ALL STUDENTS MUST ACHIEVE COMPETENCY IN ORDER TO GRADUATE. Once competency is demonstrated, students may perform these procedures under general supervision. Suggested Technical Competencies : \"Suggested Competencies\" are those procedures for which we recommend that students attain proficiency, but are not required for graduation. Technical Competencies Requiring Direct Supervision: \"Competencies Requiring Direct Supervision\" are those proc edures which can NEVER BE PERFORMED WITHOUT DIRECT SUPERVISION. Other Skills/ Procedures : Skills generally required by individual clerkship directors in order to pass specific clerkships, not included in the above lists. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 84 July 2014 Documenting Competencies in Clin ical Skills Core Technical Competencies Venipuncture IV placement EKG NG tube insertion Intradermal skin testing Urethral Catheterization of male patient Urethral Catheterization of female patient Removal of urethral catheter from male patient Removal of urethral catheter from female patient Dressing changes Obtaining peak flow measurements Suture removal Throat cultures Suggested Technical Competencies Administration of Eye Drops IM injections Subcutaneous injections Heel and finger sticks Placement of non invasive monitors Technical Competencies Requiring Direct Supervision All other procedures including but not limited to: Lumbar puncture Thoracentesis Paracentesis Arterial blood gas assessment Airway management -ambu -bagging, assist intubation Assist at cesarean delivery Assist at vaginal delivery Assist at laparoscopic or robotic surgery Assist at open abdominal surgery Basic interpretation of fetal monitor tracing Basic interpretation of obstetrical sonogram Central venous access Collection of DFA's CXR interpretation Functional Reach Get up and go Incision and Drainage Joint injections (shoulder) KUB interpretation Mental Status exam Mini -cog Mini -mental state exam (MMSE) Pap smear Pelvic exam PHQ -2 and PHQ -9 Proper collection blood culture Splinting STD Screening Suture of laceration Ventilatory management Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 85 July 2014 It is expected that students will attain competency for the procedures during third -year clerkships. However, students must be completely certified in the Technical Core Competencies by the end of their fourth year in order to graduate. The Emergency Medicine Clerkship, as well as the Subinternships and Critical Care Clerkships provide ample opportunities for students to perform procedures that they are unable to complete during the third year. Electronic Diagnosis and Procedure Tracker In order to ensure that students have adequate exposure to a variety of presenting complaints and to comply with LCM E guidelines, students are require d to log certain diagnoses into our web -supported tracking system - E*Value. Each clerkship has a \"must -see diagnoses\" list, which can be found on the back of the Clerkship Cards handed out on the first day of each clerk ship, and students are required to enter their exposure s to these diagnoses in an on -going fashion throughout the clinical years. Students are also required to enter their role in the patient with the specified diagnosis. Roles include Interviewer, Examiner, Assessment/Plan Developer and Procedural Assistant. Mid-way through each clerkship students will meet with the Clerkship Director and should print a copy of the Diagnosis Summary report to bring to this meeting. The Cle rkship Direc tor will review the report to see a count of all diagnoses encountered and use this to guide students to additional learning experiences. In addition to logging in the \"must -see diagnoses, \" students are expected to attain competency in certain procedural skills prior to graduation from medical school. The attainment of proficiency in these skills is crucial to your ability to function as a successful intern. Each required procedure must be completed under supervision a minimum of three times and you are expected to log in these procedures into our web -supported tracking system - E*Value. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 86 July 2014 Year 3 Clerkships and Requirements Medicine -Geriatrics (12 weeks) Obstetrics -Gynecology (6 weeks) Neurology (4 weeks) Pediatrics (6 weeks) Psychiatry (4 weeks) Anesthesia (1 week) Ambulatory Care (4 weeks) Surgery (8 weeks) INTERACT (13 weeks) * * Year -long intensive ambulatory care experience interspersed throughout clerkship year. 12 students selected through a competitive application process. Prior to beginning Year 3 All students are required to take USMLE Step 1 prior to Clinical Skills Wee k (the start of year 3) unless permission for a deferral has been granted by Student Affairs. If a student is unable to pass this examination on the first attempt, s/he will be in Monitored Academic Status and removed from the clerkship setting at an appropriate interval and cannot sit for any shelf exams until a passing score is recorded on Step 1. Student Affairs will help the student develop an individualized plan for studying and retaking the exam. If the student fails the exam a second time he or she will be placed in Serious Academic Status and must appear before the Promotions Committee which will approve a plan for remediation . If the student is unable to pass Step 1 on the third attempt by the foll owing June, he or she will be dismissed . In addit ion: Students must be in compliance with all Student Health requirements before beginning clerkships. Students may plan their schedule to incorporate elective time during their third year (see guidelines for away electives listed below as well as section o n Year 3 and 4 Electives) There will be no elective credit for studying for the boards after a failure on USMLE Step 1. There will be no elective credit for repeating clinical portions of failed clerkships. Clinical Skills Week Clinical Skills Week is a re quirement to enter Year 3. Clinical Skills Week provides rising third year medical students with the basic tools necessary to successfully transition from the pre -clerkship years into clinical training. The course offer students a basic orientation to the third year (policies, procedures and requirements) through multiple interactive seminars (maximizing learning, feedback and evaluation, evidence based practice) and skill based sessions (basic procedures, note writing, and chart review practice). Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 87 July 2014 Intersession Intersession is a required week long experience that occurs during Modules 2 and 4 of year 3. Intersession is a week -long retreat from the clinical experiences of the third year that provides students with the opportunity to reflect and integrate the knowledge, skills and attitudes of clinical practice. It includes sessions on career and professional development, health policy, medical errors, and preparation for residency. Standardized Subject Exams from NBME (Shelf Exams) Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai uses the NBME Clinical Science examination s to assess student performance on the last day of each clerkship (except Anesthesia) which occur in the third year. These standardized, objective and discipline based exams require medical students to solve scientific and clinical problems. Test score s reflect the learning specific to a student's clerkship experiences, as well as their educational development resulting from the overall medical school experiences. Exams are designed to provide medical schools with an effective evaluation tool and useful examinee performance data that can be compared with a large representative group of examinees at the same stage of training. Students are required to take the Shelf Exam on the last day of the clerkship as scheduled, and can expect to receive instructio ns on where to report for this from Blackboard and from the Clerkship Coordinator. The Shelf exam is 2.5 hours in length, though students will be required to arrive early to receive instructions. Policy Regarding the Day before Shelf Exams Students a re expected to participate in clerkship activities the day before the shelf exam. However, students should not be assigned call responsibilities that day. All clerkship duties should end by 5 pm. Comprehensive Assessment 2 (COMPASS 2) COMPASS 2 is a required assessment conducted during the third year of medical school. Objectives of this six-station standardized patient assessment are to assess students' abilities to apply knowledge, concepts and principles, demonstrate fundamental clin ical skills, including clinical reasoning skills, essential to safe and effective patient care under supervision and demonstrate effective interpersonal and communication skills with patients. Competencies assessed include taking a relevant and focused his tory, performing an appropriate and focused physical examination, effectively communicating with a patient, integrating and applying data gathered to diagnostic hypotheses and accurately documenting findings and plans. Standardized patients rate students o n patient -centered data gathering of historical information, physical exam, communication and interpersonal skills. Faculty review and score students' notes on each case and provide written feedback on the notes to students. COMPASS 2 also includes a medic al ethics exercise during which students apply clinical moral reasoning to two standardized patient cases and develop a written and oral presentation for the ethics faculty. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 88 July 2014 COMPASS 2 is mandatory and students who do not meet competency standards are requ ired to successfully complete a remediation plan as determined by the COMPASS 2 faculty committee. Remediation may require activities or assessments with other students. Remediation must be completed before the student can take USMLE Step 2 CS and prior to the date that the score is guaranteed available before the NRMP decisions by programs. Remediation costs will be borne by the student and remediation may require a change in the student's schedule. Failure of the remediation would bring the student to the Promotions Committee Year 4 Clerkships and Requirements Pediatrics or Medicine Sub Internship (4 weeks) Introduction to Internship (2 weeks) Emergency Medicine (4 weeks) Online Radiology Course Critical Care (2 weeks) Electives (21 weeks total over 3rd and 4th year) There will be no elective credit for repeating clinical portions of failed clerkships. Before taking the required Sub-Internship, a clinical refresher is required for those students returning from scho larly leave into year 4 . The clinical refresher must be approved by the student's advisor. All students must take and pass USMLE Step 2 CK and CS within three attempts. See policy below. Policy for Step 2 CS and CK Students may take these examinations in any order, but for the Academic Year 201 4-2015 students must take Step 2 CS by November 1st of their fourth year and Step 2 CK by December 1st of Year 4 to allow time to retake the examinations should it be necessary. We recommend students take Step 2 CS by September 6th, 2014, however the final deadline is November 1st. It should be noted that some residency programs require documentation of USMLE Step 2 CK and/or CS prior to ranking the student in the match (mid - February of the graduating year for the NRMP , late Dec ember or early January for the Urology and Ophthalmology matches ). With permission from the Office for Student Aff airs, students with Step 1 scores greater than 230 and no failures on shelf exams may defer Step 2 CK until January 15 of their fourth year. There are no exceptions for deferral for Step 2 CS. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 89 July 2014 Students must record a passing score on the USMLE Step 2 CK and CS examinations on or before the third attempt. Failure to do so will result in administrative withdrawal from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. For any student with a cu rrent Fail in a clerkship or in a USMLE exam at the time of the NRMP deadline (usually in February of graduation year) , all programs to which the student has applied will be notified. In accordance with NRMP policie s, a student who is at risk for not being abl e to attend residency on July 1 be withdrawn from the match. Years 3 and 4 - Electives General Information A student must successfully complete a total of 21 weeks of elective credit in order to graduate. Students may take clinical electives during the third and fourth years at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai , our affiliates, or at off- campus scholarly institutions. Students may also design clinical or research electives or seek out international ex periences. The following guidelines apply to all types of electives: 40 hours are required to receive one week of elective credit You are only permitted to take one 1 -week elective (40 hours completed within a consecutive 7 - day time period); you also are permitted one additional 1 -week elective in the form of a longitudinal elective (40 hours of elective time completed over a period of weeks or months). All other electives must fall between 2 -4 weeks in length. You cannot take an elective concurrently with a required clerkship. Longitudinal electives may be taken concurrently with another non -required rotation (e.g. another elective) as long as the hours do not conflict. Elective application forms must be submitted to the Assistant Registrar, with all required signatures, no less than 2 weeks prior to the desired start date of the elective. No retroactive credit will be granted for an elective. If a student wishes to repeat an elective that has already been taken, it is possible to do so, however, elective credit will not be given for the subsequent course(s) Any request for an elective greater than 4 weeks in length requires additional approval by the Associate Dean of Student Affairs Preparation for USMLE Step 2 CK is built into the Year Four schedule with a Step 2 CK Board Review course that, if attended in its entirety, counts as two (2) weeks of elective credit Work completed for remediation (including remediation for Step I and/or Step II) is not eligible for elective credit To receive full credit for an elective you must complete each step of the elective process: 1.

International Electives Students may take electives offered by non -U.S. medical schools or other well- known international organizations . All such electives must be discussed and pre -approved by Mount Sinai Global Health Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 92 July 2014 (MSGH). Some electives can be found electives/ . MSGH funding for international electives is limited and preference is given to students who are doing research or a public health project at a Mount Sinai Global Health partner site. No funding will be given for electives that are less than 4 weeks long. The first step in applying for an international elective is completion of the online Global Health Clinical Electives Application will upload a signed letter of acceptance by the international institution directly onto the application form. All applications and requests for fu nding are reviewed by MSGH faculty and students are notified by email once a decision has been reached. Students must complete all pre -travel requirements including the health and safety briefings -training.org/training/mount requirements have been fulfilled, MSGH will forward the student's signed application form to t he Registrar's office. Students should apply for international electives at least 4 weeks prior to their planned departure date. Students should be aware that they are not automatically covered by malpractice insurance outside of the United States. Once an elective has been approved, MSGH must refer the student's name and project to the Sinai Office of Risk Management to extend malpractice insurance coverage. Students are discouraged from taking an Elective/Approved Experience in any country under U.S. Department of State or World Health Organization Traveler's Advisory status. Additional Elective Opportunities The School of Medicine has approved several structured programs that allow students to take electives off campus without specifically obtaining departmental approval. These include the following: Bioethics Exchange Program at Oxford University/King's College London Up to two fourth -year students may spend between 4 -8 elective weeks at Oxford or King's College addressing ethical issues in medical practice and learning about medical practice in the UK. Applications for this program are distributed to students in the middle of the third year through the division of Biomedical Ethics in the Department of Medical Education. Fellowship support is provid ed to defray expenses are provided. Contact Rosamond Rhodes, Ph D, for details. Hadassah Medical School Hebrew University Exchange Program The Department of Medical Education offers funding for up to two students in either Y ear 3 or 4 to pursue a four- week clinical elective at Hadassah University, in Israel. This funding will support travel and a modest stipend toward room and board. The clinical elective must be four weeks long, and the research elective can be for up to twelve weeks. It is the student's responsibility to arrange the elective, although departmental advisors may have suggestions for suitable rotations. In order to select a student for this opportunity, we ask that interested students submit a CV and a one page statement that discusses a tentative plan for their time in Israel. This information must be submitted to the Office of Student Affairs by no later than December of the student's 3rd year. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 93 July 2014 Year 3 Students and Away Electives In general Icahn School of Medicine students wishing to do away electives will do so in the fourth year. From time to time, a student may have a reason to do an away elective during elective time in Y ear three. The following should be considered: Students must meet the prerequisites set by the institution they are visiting Students should recognize that they may not be as prepared as they would be in year four with the benefit of all or most of the clinical clerkships. In general, assessments done at the away elective is set at a standard for a Y ear 4 student. Students may not know the \"system\" and logistics at an away location and with a shorter allotment time of elective in Year 3, it may be difficult to acclimate to new systems in time to be able to have an effective elective Any elective done outside of an LCME -approved school must have the approval of an Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Director of Student Electives and that approval must acknowledge that this mentor approves the elective for the stud ent in Y ear 3 If there are any questions or concerns, students are encouraged to meet with the Director for Student Electives or their Faculty Advisor to discuss Ensuring that your Mentor/Preceptor has Submitted an Evaluation Electives at Icahn School of Medicine Towards the end of your elective, including away electives, you must deliver to the mentor/preceptor mentor/preceptor will complete and return to the Registrar's Office at the conclusion of the elective. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that this form is completed and r eturned to the Registrar's Office (Email: registrar@mssm.edu or Fax: 212 -369-6013) at the conclusion of the elective. Electives at other schools If you are doing an elective at another institution and they wish to use their own institution's form for evaluation rather than the Icahn School of Medicine form, the mentor/preceptor may complete their institution's form and submit that to the Assistant Registrar. It is the student's responsibility to follow -up with those schools to receive your grade and communicate that to the Assistant Registrar. How Electives are Graded All electives are graded Pass, Fail, or Honors. There is no High Pass. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 94 July 2014 Completing an Evaluation of the Elective Electives at Icahn School of Medicine All third- and fourth- year students are required to evaluate each elective experience AND the preceptor through the E* Value System using their existing login and password. Evaluations assist us in understanding and evaluating the effectiveness of the electives. Evaluations must be completed no later than 4 weeks after receiving an E* Value notification via email . If a student does not complete the mandatory evaluation four weeks after receiving notification, the student will receive a n Incident report and no credit for the elective. Please refer to Student Conduct section of Handbook on Incident reports . If the MSPE has been submitted, it will be amended and re -uploaded to reflect this breach of professionalism. The evaluations must be filled out in order to receive credit for the elective. Electives Review System Students are encouraged to ensure that they are on track with meeting their elective requirements for graduation by logging in to the Electives Review System (https://register.mssm.edu/review/index.html ) using their Icahn School of Medicine ID and life number. Medical Student Compliance Protocol and Requirements In order to be able to participate in clinical educational activities (e.g. Art and Science of Medicine, clerkships, electives and other clinical activities) all medical students must meet the compliance requirements of the School of Medicine, affiliated h ospitals and clinical sites. To ensure that all students are in compliance and able to participate in clinical educational activities, the Medical Education office monitors compliance and notifies students when they need to update their status. In order to provide adequate time and opportunity for students to update their status and maintain compliance, the Medical Education office has adopted a prospective process to inform students of requirements and status.

Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 96 July 2014 Research Opportunities A long- term goal of medical research is to improve diagnosis and therapy. For this to be possible it is usually necessary to understand the mechanism underlying disease onset or progression. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is home to investigat ors involved in cutting- edge research. Many enjoy serving as mentors to medical students and training them to carry out a research project. What is learned in the classroom, or on clinical rotations, must be considered as just a beginning. There is so much not yet understood that any number of opportunities exist to ask \"why?\" or \"how?\" Medical Student Research Office http://icahn.mssm.edu/education/medical -education/medical -student -research -office The Medical Student Research Office (MSRO) is located in Annenberg Building, Room 12 -18, 12th Floor. It exists to help medical students identify interesting areas of research , locate mentors, and apply for funding. The office supports all students, regardless of whether they have had previous research experience. Information on ongoing Icahn School of Medicine student research programs is available on the MSRO web site. Resear ch projects can be carried out during the summer break between the first and second years, during elective time in Y ears 3 and 4, or during a Scholarly Year. Students also may elect to do a Scholarly Year after their second, third, or fourth years in order to obtain a more intensive research experience while still maintaining their student status. SCHOLaR (Scholarship and Research) Program SCHOLaR offers students the opportunity to obtain mentored research training and scholarly development beginni ng during the first year of school. The goal of the program is to enable students to develop an understanding of the use of the scientific method in medicine, encourage their creativity, and support their dedication to advancing science in order to deliver the best patient care possible. Many of the programs supported by the MSRO enable students to fulfill the goals of SCHOLaR while working to generate a scholarly product, a graduation requirement. Summer Research Program http://icahn.mssm.edu/education/medical -education/medical -student -research - office/programs/summer- research -programs This 8 -week program is for s tudents who have completed their first year of school. Research can be in one of 8 SCHOLaR tracks, including Basic/ Translational, Clinical, or Clinical/Translational and Entrepreneurship; Health Evidence and Policy; and Medical Humanities. Information about funding, available on a Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 97 July 2014 competitive basis to support the work of students who do approved research, can be found ) Students may accept only one source of funding, unless the second source of funding is to cover an additional expense not associated with most projects, such as travel, and prior approval is obtained from the MSRO. Students are encouraged to collaborate on their work, if appropriate. However, in order to ensure that all students have ownership of their work, two students may not work on exactly the same project. All human subjects research must have received IRB approval in order for students to receive their summer stipends. Participating students present their work at the annual Medical Student Research Day by submitting their own abstract and presenting a poster or by giving an oral presentation that describes their project and the results they obtained. Medical Student Research Day Medical Student Research Day, held in the spring, is a chance for students to share the results of their projects with the Icahn School of Medicine community. Participants receive training on how to write an abstract and how to prepare a poster or give an oral talk. More advanced students may use the opportunity to hone their presentation skills in anticipation of giving a presentation at a national meeting. Research Day is open to all medical students, regardles s of whether they did their research at Icahn School of Medicine or another site. All abstracts are published in the Research Day Abstract Book. Further information about Medical Student Research Day is available at http://icahn.mssm.edu/education/medical -education/medical -student -research -office/research -day . The Scholarly Year Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai aims to produce physicians who are lifelong learners, able to grow as the field of medicine grows. This ability allows our students not only to provide the highest quality medical care to their patients and to fulfill themselves intellectually, but also encourages the career deve lopment of medical students who seek to become future leaders as physician -scholars and leaders. Medical students have many opportunities to enrich their education within the four -year curriculum, but these experiences are limited by required course work and clinical responsibilities. Many students interested in a more intense experience choose to devote one or two full years to developing and carrying out a strongly mentored project in an area of their choice. The Scholarly Year program at the Ic ahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is available to students who have completed their second, third, or fourth years. Such experiences may help students to identify the type of career they would pursue after graduation or provide an in -depth introducti on to their chosen area of medicine. Students interested in considering a Scholarly Year should meet with the Associate Dean for Medical Student Research as soon as possible, in order to discuss their plans and identify those programs that will best ena ble them to reach their goals. In selected cases, students can be approved to do a Scholarly Year of more than one year duration. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 98 July 2014 All students on a Scholarly Year, other than those matriculated in a second degree program, are expected to take primary responsibility for a scholarly project. The nature of the scholarly project will vary depending upon the student's interests. In the broadest terms, the project must investigate a question of scientific and medical value and be feasible within the time frame available. In addition to more traditional basic, clinical, and translational research studies, projects in health evidence and policy; design/technology/entrepreneurship; global health; medical education; community service scholarship; and the hu manities are encouraged. Projects must be strongly mentored and approved by the Associate Dean for Medical Student Research in order to be certain the experience will result in a rich, productive year. Scholarly Year students are required to submit a final product that reflects what they accomplished during the year and to present their work at the annual Medical Student Research Day in the spring. A list of funding opportunities is available at http://icahn.mssm.edu/education/medical - education/medical- student -research -office/scholarly -year -and-travel- funding/scholarly -year . Detailed guidelines for student s about the process of obtaining approval to do a Scholarly Year are available at http://icahn.mssm.edu/education/medical -education/medical- student -research - office/programs/scholarly -year/scholarly -year -guidelines . Guidelines for mentors of students who want to do a Scholarly Year, including what to include in a letter of support, are available at http://icahn.mssm.edu/education/medical -education/medical -student - research -office/programs/scholarly -year/mentors -guidelines . Information on how to prepare the research proposal required of students who do a research Scholarly Year and are not participating in a national program can be obtained at http://icahn.mssm.edu/education/medical -education/medical -student -research -office/research - guidelines/proposal- Scholarly Year Scholarly Year stud ents are regarded as fulltime students with the ability to defer loans. The time spent in scholarship is not included in the four years toward the MD degree for the purposes of determining satisfactory academic progress. All students taking a year off to do research or a degree program must submit the Request for Scholarly Year form. The Request for Scholarly Year form, which can be found at http://icahn.mssm.ed u/education/student -resources/registrar/academic -forms , must be submitted by May 15. Return from Scholarly Year Clearance to return from Scholarly Year is required. Students are required to complete a compliance checklist in order to return to the clinical realm. Students should submit The Return from Scholarly Year Form by March 1 6 of the Scholarly Year. The form can be found at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 99 July 2014 http://icahn.mssm.edu/ed ucation/student -resources/registrar/academic -forms . The scholarly product, required of everyone other than students enrolled in a second degree program, is due by May 1, as is the Scholarly Year Student Clearance Check List which addresses all compliance requirements for return to the clinical realm and return to school. At the end of a specified period, if the student does not meet the necessary requirements to return from a Scholarly Year, it will be assumed that the student no longer wishes to be con sidered in good standing and the student may be placed on administrative leave. If a student wishes to apply for reinstatement at a later date, a new application for admissions must be completed. Before taking a required Sub -Internship, in Medicine or Ped iatrics, a clinical refresher is required for those students returning from scholarly leave into the fourth year. The clinical refresher must be a rigorous experience such as Emergency Medicine. Experiences other than Emergency Medicine must be approved by the student's Faculty Advisor. Travel Grant Award MSRO Travel Grant Awards support travel for MD, MD/MPH, MD/MSCR, and MD/PhD students during their MD years to present their research at scientific conferences. MD/PhD students will be supported to present work done during their MD years if it is unrelated to their PhD research. The MSRO supports student travel only if the student's mentor agrees to match the award of 50% of eligible expenses up to a maximum of $500. In some cases, students can ob tain support from a conference, another travel award (e.g., from CMCA or MSTAR), or the Global Health Institute. In this case, the requirement for the mentor's support may be waived. Although there is no cap in annual support, the MSRO will only fund 1 tri p per project and up to $500 per trip. Students who have a second abstract on another project accepted for presentation are eligible to apply for additional funding, but will only be supported if funding permits. Students on a Scholarly Year or Leave of Absence are not eligible for a MSRO travel grant award. Most national programs and mentors support travel for students to present their work during a Scholarly Year. Further information is available on the MSRO website at this link: http://tinyurl.com/k9df5aa . PORTAL (Patient -Oriented Research, Training, and Leadership) PORTAL is a 5 -year, 38 credit, multidisciplinary program for medical students interested in careers as clinical investigators. Students who have applied to the MD program and been invited for an interview are eligible to apply. This strongly mentored 5 -year program offers a multidisciplinary approach to clinical investigation in order to introduce medical students to the field of clinical/tr anslational research and how it drives the practice of clinical medicine. Students are part of a select group of scholars that integrate learning about clinical medicine, along with how to establish a career in clinical investigation from the very start of their medical education. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 100 July 2014 Participants learn how to design and carry out original research studies leading to new approaches to the prevention, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of the disease. This comprehensive dual degree program prepares student s for a future as life long learners and careers in academia, research institutes, industry or regulatory agencies. The curriculu m focuses on helping students gain critical thinking skills and offers a solid foundation for conducting independent patient -oriented research studies. For their thesis research, students pursue original scholarly research on a subject of their choice, g uided by a faculty mentor and the program directors. This entails the formulation of a research question, the design and conduct of a research plan, analysis of resulting data, and presentation of the findings. Students begin the program during Y ear 1 of medical school. Coursework is taken during Y ears 1 and 2, and the Scholarly Year of medical school. Most of the thesis work is done during the Scholarly Year. Students who successfully complete the program will be awarded an MD and a Masters in Clinical Research. Complete information on the program, including the curriculum, can be found at http://icahn.mssm.edu/educatio n/medical -education/medical -student -research -office/programs/portal . Students selected for the PORTAL program receive full tuition scholarships to cover tuition for the MSCR degree. There is no medical school tuition during the Scholarly Year. PORTAL p articipants will receive a stipend during their Scholarly Year to cover living expenses, including health insurance. Distinction in Research This track is for students who carry out an original research project, rather than participating in a technical capacity on an ongoing project. Graduation with Distinction in Research is awarded to students who publish a peer -reviewed manuscript on which they are the first author or who submit a first author manuscript on their work that is judged to be of publication quality by an ad hoc Distinction in Research Committee. Students who graduate with Distinction in Research will receive diplomas at Commencement stating that they have graduated with \"Distinction in Research\" and they will be recognized at the Icahn Schoo l of Medicine Achievement Ceremony. This is an exciting opportunity for students to receive recognition for creativity and originality. It is a valuable educational component for those interested in a career in either academic or clinical medicine. Student s are encouraged to begin their research during the summer between their first and second years. Program guidelines and a link to the application form are available at http://icahn.mssm.edu/education/medical -education/medical- student -research - office/distinction -in-research/student -guidelines . Additional Support of Research Activities The Research Resources site contains additional helpful information including how to write an abstract, prepare a research proposal, give an oral talk, make a poster, obtain IRB approval, and access biostatistical support when planning a project or analyzi ng http://icahn.mssm.edu/education/medical - education/medical- student -research -office/research -guidelines . Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 101 July 2014 Attendance S tandards General Principles Active participation in the medical education program is a critical component of the professional development of a physician. Lack of attendance for any reason does not relieve a student from responsibility for material covered during that absence. Students must notify their course, clerkship, and/or small group preceptor about any anticipated or sudden absence from a required didactic or patient care session. Students should make certain that they have the appropriate phone, ema il, and/or page numbers to carry out this responsibility. Absences due to illness for more than two (2) days require a written doctor's note be sent to Student Affairs. Absences from examinations will only be accommodated under extreme circumstances (see Missed Exam Policy). Regarding Illnesses If you have any concerns about your ability to function as a clerk or about the risk that you might transmit an infection to patients because of an illness, please contact the clerkship directors. We are here to help you through any challenges that arise during your education. Religious Observances The School of Medicine recognizes and respects the religious beliefs and practices of its students and seeks to accommodate them reasonably within the requirements of the academic schedule. Students who anticipate being absent because of religious observance must request permis sion two (2) weeks in advance for the absence from their course or clerkship director (see notification guidelines below). In the event a student is unable to complete an examination or assessment due to a religious observance, the student will be permitted the opportunity to make up the examination or assessment . No fees of any kind shall be charged by the School of Medicine for making available an opportunity to make -up the missed examination or assessment. The request for this must be made two weeks in a dvance of the absence. Jury Duty The School of Medicine cannot excuse you from Jury Duty. In New York with the first deferral, students have the chance to select a date that they are available. First- year students should defer to summer; second -year st udents should defer to board study time or elective time in their third year; third -year students should defer to their fourth year during their elective period, and fourth -year students should find time during elective time (avoid interview time). When requesting a deferment, you should go in person with your student ID. The Court has allowed deferments even for more than a year in several cases. The visit can be made at any time preceding the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 102 July 2014 assigned date or on the assigned date and this visit should be made at the most flexible time. Jury Duty is an excused clerkship absence but students will have to make up all missed time. It is suggested that students use flexible time as suggested above. You may try calling 646-386-5960 to avoid the visit downt own if this is after your first deferment. You may also request a letter from the Registrar ( registrar@mssm.edu ) that states your full- time status as a student at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Year 1 and 2 Excused Absence Policy Attendance is mandatory at all small group sessions, laboratories, ASM sessions, Frontiers in Science lectures, COMPASS I, and any sessions or classes designated as \"patient encounters\" where patients or families are pre sent. Please note that occasionally the schedule may be changed without advance notice and students should refer to the Academic Calendar when planning any travel . If plans are made for time away based on a day having only lectures scheduled, the student c ould be in jeopardy of missing a required activity if the schedule is changed. If the course schedule changes within two (2) weeks of the planned absence, the student will be excused from the required activity . Unexcused absences are considered unprofess ional behavior, will be noted, and may have an adverse e ffect on a grade including failure of a component of a course or an entire course. The following will be considered excused absences: Illness Urgent medical evaluation Religious observance Jury duty Significant family event (e.g. graduation, family reunion, religious ceremony, wedding, illness) Death of a family member or close friend Attending a wedding in which student is a member of the wedding party Present work at a regional or national confer ence Student is a member of a national committee (e.g. AMSA, AMA, AAMC) with a leadership role and is asked to attend a meeting One conference (medical or scientific) per academic year as an attendee, if student receive s funding from a department, or a scholarship or grant Attending an Executive Curriculum Committee (ECC), Promotions Committee or Mistreatment Committee meeting as a student member Reporting your absence for Years 1 and 2 Excused absences need to be requested two (2) weeks in advance (this does not pertain to illness or death in the family) . To secure an excused absence, the following must take place at the student's initiative: The student must send an email to Student Affairs at medstu dentabsence@mssm.edu and copy the course director and small group preceptor to request an excused absence. Requests made after the class begins will not be considered excused. Requests for excused absences are reviewed by Student Affairs and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 103 July 2014 students will be notified of approval or non -approval within three (3) days of sending a request. The following should be indicated in the email: Student Name: Date of Absence: Current Course: Name of Course Director: Name of Small Group Leader: Reason for the absence request from the approved list of excused absences : For illness, students must email medstudentabsence@mssm.edu and copy the course director. Absences longer than two ( 2) days for illness require a doctor's note be submitted to Student Affairs. Although the absence is excused, there may be make -up work required and the course director will decide on appropriate make -up and inform the student. It is the student's responsibility, and not the course/cl erkship director's, to make sure that the make -up is completed in a timely manner. Consequences of Unexcused Absences for Years 1 and 2 Students must attend all mandatory sessions (i.e., mandatory lecture hall sessions, small group discussions, laboratorie s) or submit an absence req uest prior to the session. Students arriving more than 10 minutes after the session start time are considered absent. Unexcused absences will have the following consequences: First absence: 2 points off final grade Second absenc e: 2 more points off final grade and an Incident Report Third absence: Course failure LCE Absences A student who wishes to be excused from a mandatory course session must contact the ASM course directors, the relevant c ourse director and medstudentabsence@mssm.edu . The ASM course director s, the relevant c ourse director and Student Affairs will jointly decide whether the event is of significant magnitude to justify the Year 1 -2 session absence. The LCE coor dinator should also be copied on all e mail correspondence. Years 3 and 4 Excused Absence Policy The clinical phase of the curriculum requires a fulltime commitment by the student in patient care and didactic activities. Students serve as members of the health care team and assume an active role in the care of the patient. Their presence, participation and engagement at the bedside form the cornerstone of learning in the clinical environment. In these clinical years, students are required to attend all cl erkship functions including night, holiday, and weekend duty , as well as participate in all educational exercises, e.g., Clinical Skills Week, shelf exams, COMPASS 2, Intersession, Career Planning Services Day, and any Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 104 July 2014 required remediation. Excused absence s may affect your evaluations. Unexcused absences from any of the above may result in a n Incident Report or failing grade , and students may be required to make up days missed or the entire clerkship depending on the length of time involved. The following will be considered excused absences: Residency interview Step 2 CS and Step 2 CK exam days Illness Urgent medical evaluation Religious observance Jury duty Significant family event (e.g. graduation, family reunion, religious ceremony, wedding, illness) Death of a family member or close friend Attending a wedding in which student is a member of the wedding party Present work at a regional or national conference Student is a member of a national committee (e.g. AMSA, AMA, AAMC) with a leadership role an d is asked to attend a meeting One conference (medical or scientific) per academic year as an attendee, if student receive s funding from a department, or a scholarship or grant Attending an Executive Curriculum Committee (ECC), Promotions Committee or Mistreatment Committee meeting as a student member Reporting your absence for Years 3 and 4 Excused absences need to be requested a minimum of one (1) month in advance of the clerkship (this does not pertain to illness or death in the family). For all exc used absences, the student should email the clerkship director(s), clerkship coordinator and medstudentabsence@mssm.edu . Requests for excused absences are approved by your Clerkship Director and are reviewe d by Student Affairs. Students will be notified of approval or non -approval within three (3) days of sending a request. The following should be included in the email : Name of student and clerkship Dates and number of days excused Reason for the excused absence Absences longer than 2 days for illness require a written doctor's note be submitted to Student Affairs. If two or more excused absences occur in the clerkship: a) the clerkship director can offer make- up experiences , if available or possible and b) if make -up experiences are not possible, then at the discretion of the clerkship director, the student will need to reschedule the clerkship . If the student knows that they will need 3 days of excused absences during a rotatio n, they will need to request elective time for that peri od when completing the lottery. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 105 July 2014 Policy for Residency Interviews Advance notificatio n of at least one (1) month to the clerkship director(s) and c lerkship coordinator is critical to ensure that clinical obligations are met. It is understood that on occasion this is not possible , but students are expected to advise the Directors and Coordinators immediately or with one month's notice. If a student needs to miss two (2) days for residency interviews, th ey will be expected to make up the missed time. The c lerkship director(s) will determine when and how this happens. If a student needs to miss three (3) or more days for residency interviews, then s/he will need to do one extra week of the clerkship. The timing of this will be determined in conjunction with the c lerkship director(s). As with all absences, the student should email the c lerkship director, clerkship coordinator and copy medstudentabsence@mssm.edu . Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 106 July 2014 Grading System The Course or Clerkship Director is responsible for clearly delineating and communicating the criteria utilized for assessment of student performance at the outset of the learning experience. This should include the number and format of all examinations, t he weighting of examinations in the determination of a final grade, and the criteria for passing. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai transcript will reflect a complete and accurate grading history for all courses in the medical school. This is consistent with guidelines from the AAMC and most universities and colleges. Years 1 and 2 Grades Course directors will complete a grade roster within two weeks of the end of course completion. Online evaluations of student performance in laboratories, clinics, small- group sessions, and/or conferences are provided by faculty supervising these activities. Grading in Years 1 and 2 is on a Pass/Fail basis. A student who does not complete a course will receive an Incomplete. Types of situations where a student may not complete a course include illness or family emergencies. The Incomplete will change to a Pass or Fail once the student has successf ully completed the course. A student who receives a failing grade in a course will follow a remediation plan devised by the course director. Successful remediation of a failing grade results in a final grade of FP (Fail remediated to Pass). Course Direct ors will identify the bottom 5% of passing students. Students in this score range will be designated internally as having received a \"marginal pass\" for tracking and monitoring purposes only. Marginal grades are considered a full Pass on the transcript . However, marginal grades are tracked by Student Affairs as part of an early warning system for students at risk of academic difficulty. A student receiving a marginal grade on an examination or in a course may be brought to the attention of Students Affairs for counseling in order to strategize about how to avoid future difficulties. A student who has three marginal passes in an academic year will be placed on Monitored Academic Status. See page 126 for a full description of academic status. A student who fai ls a course in Year 1 must remediate the course before starting Year 2. A student who fails a course in Year 2 must remediate the course before taking USMLE step 1 and starting Year 3. The remediation process is determined by the Course Director. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 107 July 2014 Online Testing For the purposes of this policy, \"test\" refers to both exams and quizzes. Tests in Year 1 and 2 are administered online through Blackboard. To avoid technical difficulties during the test taking process, students should not take their tes t using a wireless internet connection. Students are strongly advised to take tests during times when the Help Desk is available to assist should technical problems arise. The Library help desk is open Monday through Friday 8 am - 8 pm, Saturday 9 am - 5 pm, and Sunday 12 pm - 8pm. Duration of Exam Windows The standardized exam window for all courses opens at 4 pm on Friday and closes at 8 am on Monday. When a holiday occurs on a Monday, the exam window will be e xtended to close at 8 am on Tuesday. Students who are not able to complete an exam in the standard window for a valid reason, as outlined in the \"Missed Test Policy\" below, will have the option of scheduling an alternative exam window. Duration of Qu iz Windows There is no standardized quiz window. The window for quizzes is determined by the Course Director and will be communicated to students in the course syllabus and on the Google calendar. Exam Review Policy for Year 1 and 2 Courses In an effort to provide expedited feedback to students after exams, exams administered in the first two years of medical school will be available for review online immediately after the close of an exam window. Students will be able to view their own exam, see the answer they chose and the correct answer. At the close of the exam window, the Year 1 or Year 2 Coordinator will release the exam for student viewing for 24 hours ONLY. Other options for reviewing exams will continue to include: Making an appoin tment to go over the exam with the Course Director; Reviewing the exam hard copy that is posted on the bulletin board in the Office of Curriculum Support (OCS, ANN 1340) for 2 -3 days after the exam window closes; Reviewing the exams binder in OCS, where exams are stored after they are taken down from the board in OCS. A student must make an appointment to review the binder and can do so by contacting the Office of Curriculum Support at 212 -241-7057. Missed Test Po licy for Years 1 and 2 In Years 1 and 2, the ability to take a test (examination or quiz) on line and in a window of time over several days provides students with flexibility about when and where they take the test. Given this Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 108 July 2014 flexibility, there are only a few instances when permission to take a test outside the test window may be granted by the Course Director(s) and the Office for Student Affairs. Students may request permission to take a test outside of the test window for illness or a personal emerg ency. A student must request such permission from the Course Director(s) and medstudentabsence@mssm.edu prior to the test closing time. Should the need for permission arise suddenly and when the student cannot hear from the Course Director or the Office for Student Affairs in a timely manner (at night or on the weekend) the student may assume the request is granted. If the request is because of illness, the student must provide a physician's note to that effect. If the request is granted, the Course Director will give the student a specified time to take the test. Years 3 and 4 and the Art & Science of Medicine 1 and 2 Grades The Art & Science of Medicine (ASM) courses in Years 1 and 2 as well as the clerkships in Years 3 and 4 have a special focus on the teaching and assessment of clinical skills and may use any of the following in assessing a student's performance: Faculty, preceptor or resident evaluations Oral and/or written examinations NBME subject test exams Written or oral presentations of a specific subject related to the clerkship or course Exams using standardized patients or simulations Observed structured clinical exams The weight given to specific parameters may vary with an individual clerkship or course. Each Clerkship or Course Director completes an individual grade sheet for each student. The sheet includes the final grade plus a comprehensive narrative paragraph. The final grades and narratives for clerkships completed be fore the beginning of Year 4 are an integral part of the student's MSPE. All reports of student performance are due in the Office of the Registrar within six weeks of the clerkship's completion. The grading system for most required clerkships is H (Honor s), HP (High Pass), P (Pass), CP (Conditional Pass), and F (Fail). ASM 1 and 2 in Years 1 and 2 respectively and Critical Care and Introduction to Internship in Year 4 are graded Pass/Fail. Electives are graded on a system of Honors/Pass/Fail. A student will receive a temporary grade of Conditional (C) in the event they fail the NBME subject exam or other final exam if other assessments and clinical evaluations are satisfactory e. Upon successful completion of the failed exam, the grade is revised to a C onditional Pass (CP) or Conditional High Pass (CHP). There is no Conditional Honors. If the student fails the exam on the retake, he or she will receive an overall failing grade and will need to retake the entire clerkship and then take the NBME exam or final exam again. Students are not permitted to retake a passed NBME subject examination to improve a grade. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 109 July 2014 A student can fail a clerkship based on overall clerkship score, unsatisfactory clinical evaluations or a repeated failure on an NBME subject exam or final exam. Students who behave unprofessionally during the clerkship are also at risk of failing. If a student is felt to be unprofessional to the point that evaluators do not feel that the student is a reliable, accurate reporter of clinical data a trustworthy team member, the student will receive a failing grade. A student who receives a failing grade for a clerkship must retake all or part of the clerkship at the discretion of the Clerkship Director and the promotions committee. Upon successful completion of remediation a student will receive a grade of FP. All students must pass all clerkships in Year 3 to advance to Year 4. Missed Test Policy for Years 3 and 4 In Years 3 and 4, a student must request permission from the Clerkship Director(s) and medstudentabsen ce@mssm.edu to miss an NBME subject examination or other clerkship examination. The policy for making up a missed NBME subject examination is below. The Clerkship Director will schedule any other clerkship exams with the student. Shelf Exam Retake Poli cy and Guidelines This policy applies to students taking the shelf exam due to: Shelf failure Excused absence (illness, death in family, religious observance, other emergency) Options for shelf retakes are as follows: During the Board Review Course in July (students will not be charged for the exam) During elective or vacation time; Monday -Friday only (students must pay for the exam) Exceptions to this rule are made only under approval of a student's advisor/Student Affairs and clerkship director. Guide lines for shelf retakes: Shelf failures: Students who fail a shelf exam must meet with their advisor and/or Shashi Anand to determine when they will retake the exam. Deadline for shelf retakes for the academic year is the retake day which occurs in July during the Board Review course A request from Student Affairs must be made to Jennifer Reyes ( jennifer.reyes@mssm.edu ) who will need the following information and subsequently arrange for the shelf retake : Original test date Timeframe for shelf retake If rush scoring is required (fee will be charged to either the student or the Department of Medical Education) Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 110 July 2014 Who is paying for exam: student, Med Ed, CMCA, other Excused absences: If a student anticipates that they will be miss a shelf exam due to illness, death in family, religious observance or other emergency, they must notify the Clerkship Director and medstudentabsence@mssm.edu . Jennifer Reyes will coordinate the shelf retake based on the 3 options above and will inform the student. Fees for shel f exams retakes are as follows: Shelf exam: $4 1 (as of July 1, 201 4) Expedited fee: $150 (if order placed less than 21 business days o f the exam date). If not, it will incur this expedited fee. A shelf exam that is returned without being used, for example, a student who requests to retake a shelf and then is unable to do so on the specified date, will incur a $150 from the NBME for which the student would be responsible Rush scoring: $100 (must be requested at time of ordering exam) A check in the amount of the exam and additional fees (if applicable) is to be made out to Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and submitted to Jennifer R eyes prior to taking the exam. Grades and Transcripts Official transcripts of courses taken at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai toward fulfillment of the MD degree requirements will identify a grade for each course or clerkship as described above. Written narrative evaluations are not part of the transcript and will not be duplicated or mailed with transcripts; however, all clinical narratives for clinical co urses and clerkships completed before the beginning of Year 4 are included in the MSPE . Grade Appeals Policy All grade change requests must be brought by the student to the course/clerkship director. If there is a discrepancy after the meeting between th e student and course/clerkship director, the student should present the issue to the Associate Deans of Curricular and Student Affairs. The Associate Deans of Curricular and Student Affairs will ensure that due diligence was done by the course/clerkship di rector and that, in fact, no error was made. The Associate Deans will also explain the grade appeals process to the student. If the student wishes to pursue a grade appeal, the Associate Deans will contact the relevant Department Chair. The Department Ch air will establish a faculty committee to address the appeal. The Department Chair or his/her designee will serve as chair of the appeals committee. The course or clerkship director cannot serve on the appeals committee. Information for the appeal will be solicited from the student, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 111 July 2014 course/clerkship director, course/clerkship faculty and others as needed. Deliberation of the committee should address the student's appeal question. The decision made by the grade appeal committee is final. The studen t should recognize that, following the appeals process, his/her grade may be amended in a direction that is not desired. In all cases of grade changes following the appeals process, the student's record and official school transcript will be amended to reflect the changed grade. A student has four (4) weeks from the date the grade is released by the course/clerkship director to make the appeal. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 112 July 2014 Academic Difficulty Academic Support and Tracking of Performance In order to provide support in a timely manner for students in academic difficulty, a system is in place that tracks students' performance in Y ears 1 and 2. The bottom 5 percent of students passing each course will be identified as having a marginal pass . The grade is recorded as a pass on the transcript and the designation of marginal pass is NOT reflected in any official record. A student's Faculty Advisor will reach out to him or her in the event of a marginal grade on an examination or in a course to determine the significance of the grade and the need for support. A student with three or more marginal passes will be considered in Monitored Academic Status (see section on Academic Status). Academic Progress Academic Progress refers to t he satisfactory completion of academic requirements, institutional requirements, and licensing examinations within the required timeframe. All students in the MD program are expected to complete 8 semesters, but students have no more than 12 semesters (one- and-a-half times the accredited program length) of enrolled credit to complete the degree. A student who requires enrollment in more than 12 semesters is considered to not be making Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). Students must meet SAP in order t o remain eligible for loans and financial aid for that time period. Scholarly leave is not considered extending the time needed to complete the program. Each student is assessed at the end of each year by Student Affairs to ensure that the student is meeting SAP. Students must pass all Year 1 courses to move onto Year 2 and all their Year 2 courses and take USMLE Step 1 to advance to Year 3. Third -year clerkships must be taken and completed in Year 3 in order to advance to Year 4. Only the Anesthesia clerkship is potentially deferrable to Year 4. A student who fails a Year 1 course can remediate the course over the summer between Year 1 and 2. A student who fails a Year 2 course can remediate the course between the end of Year 2 and the beginning of Ye ar 3. A student requires permission from Student Affairs and the course director to remediate a course at any other time. A student who fails three (3) or more courses in a year may be required to repeat the entire year, at the discretion of the Promotions Committee. Academic Standing Academic progress is related to academic standing. A student will be considered in \"Good Standing\" if he or she meets the following requirements: Is not in Serious Academic Status (see Academic Status section of the Medical Student Handbook) or academic probation (see Academic section of Graduate School Handbook). Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 113 July 2014 Passes licensing examinations within the specified timeframe; medical students must pass USMLE Step 1 to progress to Year 3 and pass Step 2 CK and CS to graduate. Pays on time all bills including tuition, fees and, if applicable, housing. Meets school standards and deadlines for health assessments, immunization status, PPD testing, BLS training and other requirements as determined by Student Affairs. A student who f ails to meet one or more of the components above may be subjected to certain \"holds\" which can include failure to advance to the next year of training, ability to release a transcript or to receive a letter of recommendation from the administration. Please see the Registrar section of this handbook for a more detailed explanation of holds. Academic Status At Icahn School of Medicine , academic status falls into three categories: satisfactory academic status, monitored academic status, and serious academic st atus. Satisfactory Academic Status Satisfactory Academic Status means that a student has met all course/clerkship requirements or has successfully remediated any course/clerkship failures or other issues pertaining to academic performance as detailed in t he following sections. Monitored Academic Status Students will be considered in Monitored Academic Status in the event of any one of the following: A course failure in Years 1 or 2. Three marginal performances in an academic year. Marginal is defined as falling in the bottom 5% of passing grades. A failure of USMLE Step 1, Step 2CK or Step 2CS. Failure of two NBME subject examinations in Year 3 clerkships. Students in Monitored Academic Status will be notified in writing of this determination and be required to meet with Student Affairs to help plan appropriate interventions. This status will not be noted on the transcript or the MSPE. Students who meet one of the criteria for Monitored Academic Status as specified above will be advised to prioritize s tudying for courses, but will not be required to relinquish Icahn School of Medicine extracurricular activities. They are permitted to take a S cholarly Year or leave of absence but must remediate any failures before starting the leave. An ex ception may be made for medical or extenuating reasons. These situations will be handled on a case by case basis by Student Affairs. For Year 1 students in Monitored Academic Status, participation in summer research activities will depend on the natur e and timing of the necessary remediation. Students should meet with their Faculty Advisor and the Medical Student Research Office to plan their projects. Students in Monitored Academic Status can return to Satisfactory Academic Status if they complete one semester in Year 1 or 2, or 6 months of clerkships in Year 3 or Year 4 without any evidence of the above Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 114 July 2014 criteria, or, if they are in Monitored Academic Status for a failure on a USMLE exam, they pass it on the second attempt. A student who was once in Mo nitored Academic Status in Year 1 or 2 will return to that status if he or she has an additional marginal grade in Year 1 or 2. Serious Academic Status Students will be considered in Serious Academic Status in the event of any one of the following: Two course failures in an academic year during Year 1 or 2. A Year 3 or 4 clerkship failure. A repeated failure in a Year 1 or 2 course. A failure on USMLE Step 1, Step 2CK or Step 2CS on a second attempt. Multiple occurrences of unprofessionalism or one serious occurrence as determined by Student Affairs. Students in Serious Academic Status will be notified in writing of this determination. They will be required to appear before the Promotions Committee and will be subject to its decisions. This status will not be noted on the transcript or the MSPE unless mandated by the Promotions Committee, but students risk being placed on financial aid probation. Remediation may include tailored and/or external remediation programs (at the student's expense), and/or repetition of the semester or year (tuition required). Students in Serious Academic Status will not be permitted to participate in any Icahn School of Medicine extra -curricular activities. Year 1 students in Serious Academic Status will need to discuss t he timing of remediation and summer research with their Faculty Advisor and the Medical Student Research Office. Year 2 students in this status will not be able to apply for the special curricular programs in the third year, including InterACT and the Neur oscience experience. Students in Serious Academic Status are not considered to be in \"Good Standing\" (see above) and therefore will not be permitted to take a scholarly year or leave of absence except for medical or extenuating reasons as determined by Stu dent Affairs. While in Serious Academic Status students will be forward fed to course and clerkship directors (see below). In addition, any student in Serious Academic Status who experiences an additional course or clerkship failure must be presented again to the Promotions Committee. Failure of remediation may be grounds for dismissal. Students will remain in Serious Academic Status until they complete remediation and complete one semester in Year 1 or 2, six months of required clerkships in Year 3 or 4 without any course or clerkship failures or marginal course grades, or if they pass a USMLE exam on the third attempt. They will then be elevated to Monitored Academic Status, and from Monitored Academic Status to Satisfactory Academic Status as specifie d above. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 115 July 2014 Remediation Years 1 and 2 Policy A student who fails a course must repeat the course or an equivalent course, as determined by the Course Director. The student must achieve a pass in order to progress on to the next academic year. Remediation of courses typically occurs during the summer and must be planned through the Course Director, Curricular Affairs and Student Affairs. Participating in research during the summer is dependent on the timing of any remediation. A failure in a course is listed as \"F\" on the transcript. Once the student has successfully remediated the course it is listed as \"FP.\" Students who fail to pass the remediation for a failed course will be in Serious Academic Status and be required to appear before the Promotions Commit tee. Years 3 and 4 Policy Students who fail a shelf exam are required to remediate the shelf exam during a specified make -up day in July. If a student has failed more than one shelf, all failures must be remediated by the end of block 2 of Year 4. Failure of a shelf exam results in a Conditional (C) on the transcript. If the student passes the shelf on the second attempt, the grade will read Conditional Pass (CP) on the transcript. Repeat failure of the shelf will result in a failing grade in the clerkship. Students who fail a clerkship are required to appear before the Promotions Committee, who will decide upon a remediation plan. Remediation Plans Students may be granted designated time for remediation for coursework or exams as required. Medical students who have failed to pass one of the USMLE step exams twice are required to take a leave to study and retake the exam as soon as they are ready. Other extraordinary circumstances requiring remediation as mandated by the Promotions Committee or Student Affairs may also require a leave of absence. If repeat or remedial coursework is required, a student may be regarded as enrolled and prorated tuition may be charged. A student must be enrolled in 50% of a full course load to qualify for federal financial aid. Clearance to return from a Remediation Plan is required. Students will be required to complete any outstanding compliance needs in order to return. Forward Feeding Information regarding a student's marginal or failing academic performance and any documented issues related to professionalism may be forwarded (otherwise confidentially) from Student Affairs to a course or clerkship director at the discretion of the Associate Dean of Student Affairs and/or the Promotions Committee. The information will be of a general nature to alert the course or clerkship director to be alert to any issues that may arise with the student. Personal information will not be forwarded except when Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 116 July 2014 requested by the student. The student will be notified that this transfer of information is taking place. Information will flow from Student Affairs to course or clerkship directors, not between course directors or clerkship directors. Forward feeding allows for monitoring of a student's performance and to p rovide support and remediation as necessary. The student should receive regular feedback through the new course or clerkship. The forwarding of any material to a subsequent course or clerkship directors will continue as long as monitoring is necessary for educational purposes. There will be no mention of any of the forwarded information in the student's evaluation from that clerkship. It will be documented in the student's internal school file that information has been forwarded and to whom and specifically what information. This will not be reflected on the transcript nor will this be mentioned in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE).

Student Mistreatment Guideline Preamble Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is dedicated to providing its students, residents, faculty, staff and patients with an environment of respect, dignity and support. All members of the Icahn School of Medicine community are responsible for protecting student rights as specified in our Student Code of Conduct and the Educator Oath, and institutional policy. Educators (defined broadly to include anyone in a teaching role, including faculty, residents, fellows, nurses, staff, and students) bear significant responsibility in creating and maintaining this atmosphere. As role models and evaluators, educators must practice appropriate profes sional behavior toward, and in the presence of, students, who are in a particularly vulnerable position due to the formative nature of their status. This guideline, therefore, supplements the institutional policy on harassment and grievances, will assist in developing and maintaining optimal learning environments, and encourages educators and students alike to accept their responsibilities as representatives of Icahn School of Medicine in their interactions with their co lleagues, patients, and staff. Description of Mistreatment Mistreatment interferes with the learning environment, adversely impacts the student- educator relationship, and has the potential for disrupting patient care and research. Inappropriate and unacceptable behaviors promote an atmo sphere in which mistreatment is accepted and perpetuated in Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 119 July 2014 medical education and training. While the perception of mistreatment may differ between individuals, examples of mistreatment of students include, but are not limited to: Intentional neglect or m arginalization (e.g., ignoring, speaking down to, yelling at, ridiculing) Insults or inappropriately harsh language in speaking to or about a student Berating, belittling, humiliating or intimidating behavior Threat of physical harm or physical punishme nt (e.g. hitting, slapping, kicking) Asking to perform personal services (e.g., shopping, babysitting, picking up food) Threat of receiving a poor evaluation/grade for reasons other than course/clerkship performance Threat of altering authorship on a pu blication for reasons other than proper contribution Disregard for patient or student safety by requiring a student to perform a procedure or engage in patient care without adequate supervision. Sexual harassment, including offensive remarks, being asked to exchange sexual favors for grades or other awards, or being subjected to sexual advances Discrimination or harassment based on race, color, national origin, gender, sexual preference, age, religion, disability, marital status, military status, genetic predisposition, being the victim of spousal abuse, or based on any other characteristic protected by law. Such actions are contrary to the good will, trust, and compassion central to the learning culture and working environment in an academic medical center. These actions cannot be tolerated. The sources of mistreatment include, but are not limited to research , preclinical, and clinical faculty, fellows, residents, post -docs, nurses, allied health care workers, fellow students and patients. The Student Mistreatment Resource Panel The Student Mistreatment Resource Panel serves as a sounding board for students with concerns about mistreatment. Members of the panel will be elected by their peers and will serve their class until graduation or until the member decides not to serve in this capacity. The Student Mistreatment Resource Panel will be comprised of: One (1) medical student at the MS IV level One (1) medical student at the MS III level One (1) medical student at the MS II level One (1) medical student at the MS I level Two (2) graduate students, one who is a PhD or MD /PhD and one who is in a master's pro gram One (1) scholarly year student, who will act as chair of the Panel One to two ( 1-2) Faculty Advisors who are the medical school ombudspersons. The student panel members will: Serve as a sounding board for students with concerns about mistreatment in the educational environment. Meet with the Associate Deans for Medical Education on a biannual basis. At that time, the panel's de -identified records will be reviewed in order to improve this Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 120 July 2014 guideline and/or the program. If the panel or Deans deem it necessary, additional meetings may be scheduled. Update policies, procedures and programming based on the biannual review. Maintain confidentiality in all matters relating to the panel. Recognize potential conflicts of interest: if a panel member has a potential conflict of interest that relates to a situation brought before the group (for example, a strong personal relationship with someone involved in the situation) the panel member must recuse himself or herself when the group learns about or discuss es the situation. Likewise a student bringing a situation to the panel may request that one of the members not participate if there is a potential conflict of interest. The student should make this request to the chair of the panel or the ombudspersons. One (1) member of the panel will act as secretary and maintain de -identified records which include but are not limited to: All mistreatment concerns brought before the panel Next steps taken on mistreatment concerns (i.e. sent to Grievance Committee, spok e to Dean, etc.) All Student Mistreatment Resource Panel records will remain anonymous and only de -identified data will be presented at review meetings. Student mistreatment concerns will be handled according to the following process: Students may report a concern either in person directly to a student member of the panel or by emailing studentmistreatmentpanel@mssm.edu which is checked by a member of the panel. The panel will meet to discuss the case. Depending upon the severity and complexity of the complaint, the panel may deem it necessary or desirable for the student to meet with the group in order for the panel to ask questions or make s uggestions. Depending upon the severity or complexity of the mistreatment, or at the request of the affected student, the panel may refer the case to an appropriate group or department at Icahn School of Medicine . When this occurs, the Associate Deans for Medical Education and/or Dean of the Graduate School will also be notified. At any time during the process, if the panel becomes concerned about an immediate threat to the safety or well- being of the complainant, alleged aggressor, or any person at Icah n School of Medicine or in the community, the panel will notify the Associate Deans for Medical Education and/or Dean of the Graduate School. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 121 July 2014 Dissemination To promote a learning environment respectful of all individuals, Icahn School of Medicine will pub licize the concern about student mistreatment and this panel's existence across the institution. Education is a cornerstone in the prevention of student mistreatment. An on going effort will be made to inform all individuals involved in student education a bout the appropriate treatment of students and of this guideline. To that end, the following notification mechanisms will be utilized: Medical Students : A discussion of mistreatment and our guidelines will occur each year during year, course, and clerkshi p orientations. Each course and clerkship director will include this guideline in their course and clerkship materials. Mistreatment data collected via E*value will be shared on a quarterly basis with clerkship directors and on an annual basis with affiliate sites. Graduate Students : A discussion of mistreatment and our guidelines will occur during Orientation for first - year students. Faculty, Residents and Fellows : This guideline will be sent each year from the Dean's office to all Course and Clerkship Directors and all MTA directors, who will help disseminate the guideline to those involved in medical student education. Protection from Retaliation Retaliation against individuals who bring forward complaints of mistreatment (including but not limited to adverse effects on student evaluation) is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated. Office of Student Ombudsperson The Office of Student Ombudsperson is available to any medical student to give counsel and feedback and to discuss informally any situation they have encountered and the nature of any discrimination or abuse, and so forth. This Office is a confidential res ource for students except in cases where legal action is needed (e.g., unlawful discrimination or harassment, assault/harm to student or patient). The Office will also serve as the student's advocate in situations where the student will need to file a form al report with the Harassment Grievance Committee or the police. There is a Medical Student Ombudsp erson: Dr. Helen Fernandez - Helen.fernandez@mssm.edu pager 917 -641-4742 The Institutional Ombudsman is Barr y Stimmel, MD who may be used as an additional resource for MD students and is the main resource for all graduate students. Information about the Ombuds Office and ways to access resources may be found at: http://icahn.mssm.edu/about -us/ombuds -office Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 122 July 2014 Professionalism Professionalism encompasses a broad set of aptitudes, attitudes and behaviors. Being a professional can mean many things, including internalizing a set of shared values, behaving according to standards of medical practice or scientific investigation, and being accountable for one's actions. S tudents have a responsibility to act at all times in accordance with the highest standards of integrity. The same standards of behavior are expected in the classroom, laboratory, clinic, hospital or elsewhere on campus, including housing, or whenever a student is representing the School . Students are expected to adhere to the same professional code s of behavior generally accepted for phy sicians and scientists. Misconduct and Lapses of Professionalism Student misconduct includes, but is not limited to: cheating, plagiarism, breaches of confidentiality, falsification, unprofessional behavior toward patients and colleagues, use and abuse o f illicit drugs, abuse or inappropriate use of alcohol, dishonesty, and failure to complete administrative, medical, and financial resp onsibilities. Administrative responsibilities include course evaluations, student health clearances, HIPAA training, immu nizations, infection control training, respirator mask fitting, and BLS certification. Incident Reports and Commendations Incident reports document specific circumstances when students do not adhere to the Student Code of Conduct or demonstrate unprofessionalism. Incident reports may be completed by course or clerkship leadership or Medical Education faculty and/or administration . The initiator of an incident report will share the report with the student. The student must sign the form and has the opportunity to respond and comment on the form. The initiator will then share and discuss the report with Student Affairs. If the e vent is non -recurrent and limited to one episode, then the incident report will not become part of the MSPE or the student's permanent record . A pattern of behavior that is documented by incident reports may warrant referral to the Promotions Committee for consideration of disciplinary action and documentation in Appendix C of the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). A single egregious incident report could prompt a review by Promotions and may be documented in Appendix C of the MSPE. Examples of egregious events include but are not limited to: abandonment of patient care responsibility, lack of accountability in clinical settings, dishonesty, and disrespectful actions or behaviors involving patients, families, staff, colleagues, or supervisors. Commendations document exemplary actions or behaviors by students. The initiator of a commendation will discuss it with the student and will share it with Student Affairs . All positive commendations will be noted in Appendix C of the MSPE. Honor Code for I SMMS Exams and Quizzes Before taking this Exam or Quiz you must review and agree to abide by the following rules of conduct: 1) I will take this exam or quiz by myself, not in a group. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 123 July 2014 2) Unless a particular information source or a calculator is explicitly permitted by the Course Director, I will not use any material to assist me during this exam or quiz, including texts, on -line/Web sources/sites, auditory information, study notes, calculators or any other material. 3) I have not received feedback about th e exam or quiz from students who have taken it earlier. 4) While I take my exam or quiz, I will not communicate to ANYONE about the exam or quiz content or questions.

Plagiarism Policy Preface Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai faculty and students are committed to high standards of excellence and personal responsibility as stated in our Standards of Conduct. To that end, faculty and students are expected to assume responsi bility for their behavior and work. Definition According to the AMA Manual of Style: A Guid e for Authors and Editors (10th edition)1, plagiarism is when an author documents or reports ideas, words, data, or graphics, whether published or unpublished, of another as his or her own and without giving appropriate c redit. Plagiarism of published work violates standards of honesty and collegial trust and may also violate copyright law (if the vio lation is shown to be legally actionable). 1 The AMA Manual of Sty le goes on to define four common kinds of plagiarism: 1. Direct plagiarism: Verbatim lifting of passages without enclosing the borrowed material in quotation marks and crediting the o riginal author. 2. Mosaic: Borrowing the ideas and opinions from an original sour ce and a few verbatim words or phrases without crediting the original author. In this case, the plagiarist intertwines his or her own ideas and opinions with those of the original author, creating a \"confused, plagiarized mass.\" Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 124 July 2014 3. Paraphrase: R estating a phrase or passage, providing the same m eaning but in a different form without attribution to the original author. 4. Insufficient acknowledgment: Noting the original source of on ly part of what is borrowed or failing to cite the source material in a way that allows the reade r to know what is original and what is borrowed. Potential Venues In the medical school environment, there are numerous situations that students must be cognizant of when representing their work accurately and honestly. These in clude, but are not limited to: 1. Scholarly work including scientific papers, proposals, presentations and posters 2. The electronic medical record in the context of appropriatin g another's documentation into one's own without clear attribution 3. Written examinations or assignments whether formative or summative 4. Essays and personal statements on applications for training, awards or any other reason Consequences All concerns regarding plagiarism will be reviewed by the Associate Dean of Und ergraduate Medical Education & Student Affairs and the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Medical Ed ucation & Curricular Affairs. Based upon their findings, a student may be referred to t he Promotions Committee and be subject to its decisions which can includ e, but are not limited to, warning, probation, suspension or dismissal. Reference 1. American Medical Association (AMA). (2009). AMA Manual of Style: A Guide for Authors and Editors (10th ed.). Chicago: JAMA/Archives Journals; Oxfo rd University Press. Retrieved December 11, 2012, from http://www.amamanualofstyle.com//oso/public/index.htm Disciplinary Action Disciplinary action may include the following: Warning: an official notice in writing which describes consequences contingent on a student's future actions or behaviors. Probation : an official notice in writing that specifies a time period that must pass without incident or conditions that a student must meet to avoid further consequences, including but not limited to disciplinary action. Suspension of enrollment : a removal of the student from educational activities or patient care settings. Immediate suspensions may be made in circumstances where the student poses a risk the patient care, other members of the School community, the School, or the learning environment. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 125 July 2014 Dismissal : expulsion of a student from the School . Assault, sexual assault, theft, lying, cheating, or any intentionally dishonest behavi or, including falsification of documents or other dishonest behavior during exams will result in dismissal from the School of Medicine absent exceptional circumstances. A student who is arrested or charged with a crime is required to inform Student Affairs. Failure to do so will result in dismissal. A dismissal decision cannot be changed to a voluntary withdrawal absent exceptional circumstances. All types of disciplinary action will be given in writing. Students are required to return a sign ed copy of the letter within 14 days of receipt . Disciplinary action may be imposed by the Dean for Medical Education, the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Medical Education and Student Affairs , the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Medical Education and Curricular Affairs or the Promotions Committee. The appeals process for disciplinary action is identical to the process for appealing the decisions of the Promotions Committee. (See section on \"Co mmittee Decisions and Appeals.\") Any disciplinary action will appear in the MSPE in the Academic History section and also in Appendix C of the MSPE. (For more information about the MSPE, see Student Affairs Section.) Disciplinary actions will also be p ermanently recorded on the transcript in the comments section. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 126 July 2014 Promotions Committee Charge to the Promotions Committee The Promotions Committee is the guarantor of excellence in our graduates and its main constituency is the future patients of our graduate physicians. Its charge is therefore: A. To review medical students not meeting set standards of academic performance and/or professional behavior. B. To make annual recommendations to the Dean regarding promotion and graduation of Icahn School of Medicine medical students. This includes a recommendation to the Dean that the degree of Doctor of Medicine be awarded to those students who have satisfactorily completed the medical school curriculum in accordance with the requirements of the Board of Regents of the State of New York and the faculty of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and who satisfactorily possess the ethical and moral attributes necessary to practice of medicine. The Promotions Committee (or, at the Committee Chair's discretion, an A d Hoc Subcommittee of Promotions), may review any of the following: Students in Serious Academic Status (see section on Academic Status). Student s in Serious Academic Status who have remediated but fail another course or clerkship in the one year of monito ring. Students with one egregious or more than one critical Incident report . Any st udent whose conduct may warrant disciplinary action (see section on Disciplinary Action). A student who switches from the physician -scientist program to the regular MD prog ram, or a student who requests scholarly leave of more than 2 continuous years. A student whose requests a course of study that is different that the established tracks. (For example, a student who wishes a leave to pursue a PhD after Year 3). Actions of the Committee may include but are not limited to: Remediation plans Warning Probation Suspension Dismissal See the section on Disciplinary Action for descriptions of warning, probation, suspension and dismissal. The Promotions Committee does not hear gra de a ppeals. When grades are presented to the Promotions Committee, it should be assumed that these grades are final. The Promotions Committee does not address the validity or fairness of grades and will not discuss them during Promotions Committee meetings . Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 127 July 2014 Promotion Committee Membership and Voting A. Composition This Committee will consist of the following voting members: A Chairperson Six course and/or clerkship directors (three from Y ear 1 or 2 courses, three from clinical clerkships or courses) Ten faculty members -at-large appointed by the Dean Two fourth -year medical students (not on leave) A resident, fellow, or junior faculty member who is a recent graduate of Icahn School of Medicine The Chairperson will be appointed by the Dean for a term of three years. If one of the course or clerkship directors stops serving in their role during a term on the Committee, the individual will serve as an ex - officio member of the Committee for the remainder of the academic year. That person then may b e nom inated as a faculty member- at-large. Of the faculty -at-large, five will be recommended to the Dean by the Dean for Medical Education, and five will be recommended by the Steering Committee of the Faculty Council. The term for faculty is three years. The students will be selected by Student Council and will serve a term of one year. The recent graduate will be recommended to the Dean by the Dean for Medical Education, and will also serve a term of one year. Following review, the Dean may extend the terms of the Chair or other Committee members. The following will serve as ex officio, non -voting members of this committee: The Dean of Medical Education The Associate Dean for Undergraduate Medical Education and Student Affairs The Associate Dean for Undergraduate Medical Education and Curricular Affairs The Associate Dean for Admissions The Associate Dean for Diversity Programs, Policy and Community Affairs The Senior Director of Curricular and Student Affairs Additionally, when available, the Faculty Advisor for the student being presented will attend the meeting as a non -voting member . B. Procedures The Promotions Committee or an Ad Hoc Subcommittee may consider the student's entire school profile as it relates to overall school performance in academics and professionalism in reaching its decision. Students presented before the Promotions Committee are permitted to make a statement to the Committee explaining their perspective on the issues before the Committee. Students are also permitted to bring anothe r individual to the meeting to provide them support. The student may not be represented by an attorney and the accompanying individual may not speak during the meeting. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 128 July 2014 Decisions of the Promotions Committee shall be made by a majority vote. A quorum is defined as 9 voting members present. A quorum is required for any vote. The Chair may appoint an Ad Hoc Subcommittee to investigate and evaluate the circumstances which brought the student to the Committee's attention and to propose remedial, disciplinary , or other action to the full Committee. The Ad Hoc Committee may meet prior to a full Committee meeting, or after the student is initially considered by the Committee. The Subcommittee will consist of a minimum of three Committee members, two of whom must be faculty. One faculty member will serve as Chair of the Subcommittee. Before the Ad Hoc Subcommittee review, the student shall be accorded an opportunity to challenge any member of the Subcommittee for \"cause\" where, in the student's view, the Subcommit tee member would not be able to render an impartial decision. It shall be in the Ad Hoc Subcommittee chair's sole discretion (or the Promotions Committee Chair, if the challenge is to the Chair of the Subcommittee) whether to excuse such member. The stude nt shall be permitted to meet with the Ad Hoc Subcommittee and prior to that meeting shall have the right to know the reason for the Subcommittee investigation. The Student shall be permitted to attend the meeting of the Ad Hoc Subcommittee with an advis er of his/her choice and to present relevant evidence and witnesses on his/her own behalf to the Ad Hoc Subcommittee. The student may not be represented by an attorney. The Ad Hoc Subcommittee may, in its discretion, further define, expand or limit the role of any such representative and may make such additional rules in its discretion to assure fair and expeditious handling of the matter, provided such rules are consistent with these procedures . The Subcommittee shall present to the Promotions Committee of its findings and recommendation. The Promotions Committee will discuss and vote on a decision and notify the student in writing of that decision and the basis for it. The Promotions Committee decision shall be made by a majority of the full Committee. Committee Decisions and Appeals Committee decisions will be rendered verbally to the student by the Committee Chair and will be confirmed in writing. If in agreement with the outcome and letter , students are required to return a signed copy of the letter within two weeks . If a student chooses to appeal the decision of the Promotions Committee, he or she must submit a written request stating the reason for the appeal to the Dean of the School of Medicine within two weeks of receipt of decision letter. The Dean's review shall be limited to determining that procedures outlined in the Student Handbook were substantially followed and that the decision was reasonable. The Dean may, at his or her discretion, form an advisory committee to assist in reviewing the appeal. If no appeal is taken as provided above the decision shall become final. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 129 July 2014 If a student's appeal is successful, the Promotions Committee may reconvene to determine any further plan or monitoring necessary. These rules are intended to establish fair and reasonable guidelines for disciplinary action. Breaches of these rules shall not be grounds for a new proceeding unless in the opinion of the Dean the breach is of such a material nature that the validity and the truthfulness of the result are prejudiced. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 130 July 2014 Leave of Absence Overview Life circumstances may require students to take time away from courses or rotations. When the need for time off is limited (see below), students may remain enrolled and will be permitted excused absences (see excused absence policies). If the time away is extensive or indeterminate, a leave of absence (LOA) may be considered. A LOA is a period of temporary non -enrollment. A LOA constitutes a mutual agreement between school and student with regard to utilization of time during the leave, as well as the requirements that must be met prior to reentering the curriculum. All requests for a LOA are made directly to and granted at the discretion of the Office for Student Af fairs. Year 1 and 2 courses are only offered once per year and have prerequisites, and all requirements in the first semester must be completed before moving on to the second semester. Because of the schedule and volume of material, making up more than two (2) weeks of missed material may place a student at risk of poor academic performance. In Years 1 and 2, the Office of Student Affairs may grant up to two weeks of excused absences followed by a return to all coursework thereafter. Any need for time off b eyond two weeks may require a student to request a formal LOA from Student Affairs. A LOA may last for a period of up to one year, but a student can choose to convert the leave at any point to a scholarly period, during which student is considered enrolled as fulltime student (see section about the Scholarly Year). In the event of a LOA, the student would return to courses the next academic year where he or she left off. In Year 3 or Year 4, excused absences of longer than two days will require students to make up the missed parts of a rotation. A student who requires more time off may have up to eight ( 8) weeks, schedule permitting. In that event clerkships may need to be rescheduled but students may remain enrolled. Anything longer than eight weeks may re quire a LOA, which may be granted for up to one year. A student who takes a LOA may return to rotations at any point before the 12 month period ends (see section on return from LOA below), or convert the leave to a scholarly period. Based on when the leave is taken, the student may be required to make up parts or all of the rotation missed. The length of the leave may affect when a student is able to graduate. LOAs may be Medical, Personal or Administrative. See below for details. Medical LOA Either the s tudent or Student Affairs may initiate a medical LOA. A medical LOA requires a physician's endorsement and/or an administrative psychiatric or medical evaluation as ordered by Student Affairs. The term of the leave is up to one year. The leave may be exten ded for a second and final year at the School's discretion upon recommendation of a physician. All students on medical LOA are required to have health insurance and are eligible for insurance at the unsubsidized rate. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 131 July 2014 Personal LOA A personal LOA enables a student to take time off to address issues of a personal nature, including those related to the health and well -being of a family member or partner. A LOA may also be granted for issues related to childbirth, adoption, or other parental responsibilities. A personal LOA will not be granted for non -health or non -family related circumstances (for example to pursue a time -limited opportunity in athletics or other interests) until after the completion of the first semester of Year 1. Personal leaves for such n on-extenuating circumstances may not be taken at any time when the student is not in good academic standing, as defined in the Academic Standing Policy, or in Serious Academic Status, as defined in the Academic Status Section. Ordinarily, personal leaves m ay not exceed one year; however, requests to extend a personal leave into a second and final year will be considered un der exceptional circumstances. All students on personal LOA are required to have health insurance and are eligible for insurance at the unsubsidized rate. Administrative LOA A LOA can also be administrative. An administrative LOA is mandated by the school and is usually as the result of a student not complying with school requirements. Documentation of LOAs The dates for all LOAs will be noted on the Transcript and the MSPE. The reason for the LOA will not be included in these documents, with the exception of an administrative LOA, which will be designated as such on the transcript and MSPE. Financial Implications of LOA To be eligible to receive federal and institutional student aid, the student must meet and maintain the School's standards of satisfactory academic progress. (Please refer to the section entitled \"Satisfactory Academic Progress for Fin ancial Aid\" under the \"Financial Aid\" heading in this handbook.) A Leave of Absence Status greater than 180 days will move students out of their loan deferment period. The last date of attendance before the LOA is the \"Out of School\" date. After 180 days , the grace period ends and all educational federal loans will go into repayment. Students are expected to meet with the Bursar and Financial Aid Director before a LOA is finalized in order to fully understand the consequences of the LOA on loan repayment. Additional Information A student who resides in Aron Hall must vacate Aron Hall while on LOA. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 132 July 2014 While on LOA a student will have library privileges suspended. Students on LOA may not participate in any educational opportunities at Icahn School of Medicin e for credit. Clearance to Begin Leaves of Absence, Withdraw, Transfer, or Otherwise Leave the School Students who go on a LOA must obtain clearance beforehand. Students are required to meet with the Office for Student Affairs before filling out the appro priate forms. The student will receive a letter of leave and individualized conditions will apply. All students must meet the criteria and confirm agreement with the terms of the leave in writing. In addition, students must complete a sign -out form requiring the signatures of the requisite offices indicating that there are no outstanding debts or other encumbrances to the student's record and that all medical school property has been returned. When all the signatures are obtained, the student must return th e form to the Registrar's Office. There is a processing fee of $100 for leaves. Leave of absence form can be found at http://icahn.mssm.edu/education/student - resources/ registrar/academic -forms Return from LOA Clearance to return from a LOA is required. Students should refer to the individualized terms of their leave letter and must complete all required evaluations or testing prior to return. In general return from a medical leave requires a physician's note that the student is clear to return to school. At the end of a specified period of LOA, if the student does not notify Student Affairs of his or her intentions, it will be assumed that he or she no longer wishes to be considered enrolled and will be dismissed. If a student wishes to apply for reinstatement at a later date, a new application for admission must be completed. Decelerated Year 3 or Year 4 Students who have a compelling reason may request to spread either year 3 or year 4 requirements over two calendar years. Interested students must meet with Student Affairs and the Financial Aid Director to discuss the request. If approved, students will be considered 50% enrolled for this time period. Tuition will be prorated accordingly, but students will be responsible for living expenses and fees for each decelerated year. Students are enrolled during the decelerated period and loans will not go into repayment and students will be allowed to remain in housing. The period of deceleration will be noted in the Academic History section of the MSPE. Flexibility of Year 1 and 2 While the limit for excused absences in Year 1 and 2 is 2 contiguous weeks, students may watch the recordings of lectures at their convenience and only need to report to school for required patient presentations, small groups and laboratory experiences. Th is allows for significant time when a student is not required to be present at school. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 133 July 2014 Awards and Honors Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Society The New York Lambda Chapter of the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society was established at the Icahn School of Medi cine at Mount Sinai in May, 1970. The Society is composed of fourth -year medical students who have shown promise of becoming leaders in their profession and exhibit excellence in every respect, including leadership, research, professionalism, service to th e school and community, and clinical acumen. In addition to the fourth year students, three house staff, two full time faculty, and two alumni members are selected by the AOA Lambda Chapter students and inducted into the society. Student members are cho sen on the basis of their accomplishments utilizing the following criteria: Academic performance during the first three years of the medical curriculum including third -year grades and assessments along with Step I Successful research activities as document ed by formal presentations at national meetings or by publications or other scholarly work Leadership in school activities and in community service Professionalism and humanism A meeting of the Board of AOA, comprised of faculty members (outside of the Dean's office and Student Affairs), convenes to elect students soon after the beginning of the senior year. Selection is timed to allow students who have been elected into AOA to h ave this distinction noted on their MSPE's for graduate medical training. All of the above criteria are used to determine the top quartile of the class. From this group, 16% of the class is selected by the AOA board for election into the Honor Society. Gold Humanism Honor Society The Gold Humanism Society honors those students who have demonstrated humanistic values in their clinical training. The honor society was formed by The Arnold P. Gold Foundation and is widely recognized throughout the United Sta tes medical schools, many of whom have their own chapters. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai's chapter follows the Gold Foundation's definition of humanism: \"Humanism encompasses those attributes and behaviors that emanate from a deep sensitivity and respect for others, including full acceptance of all cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Further, humanism is exemplified through compassionate, empathetic treatment of all persons while recognizing each one's needs and autonomy.\" Students are nominated at the end of their third year by their peers and honored in the Gold Humanism Award Ceremony held in the fourth year, throughout the institution, within their MSPE, and at graduation. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 134 July 2014 Distinction in Medical Education Distinction in Medical Education (D IME) recognizes those students who have taken leadership roles in medical education and have developed and implemented a scholarly project related to the field of medical education. DIME is not for all students who teach, but rather it is awarded to those unique students who have dedicated significant time to and demonstrated excellence in teaching and/or curriculum development and who have taken a scholarly approach to their work in education. Students primarily engaged in teaching are required to produc e scholarly work, evaluate their teaching/education interventions, and describe how they used results to improve their teaching/intervention. Education products for teachers may include the development of concept maps, slide sets, resource materials, web - based cases, etc. Learner evaluations will provide important evidence of quality if a project is primarily related to teaching. Distinction in Research This track is for students who carry out an original research project, rather than participating in a technical capacity on an ongoing project. Graduation with Distinction in Research is awarded to students who publish a peer -reviewed manuscript on which they are the first author or who submit a thesis of their work that is accepted by their Distinction in Research Committee. Students who graduate with Distinction in Research will receive diplomas at Commencement stating that they have graduated with \"Distinction in Research\" and they will be recognized at the Graduation Achievement Ceremony. This is an exciting opportunity for students to receive recognition for creativity and originality. It is a valuable educational component for those interested in a career in either academic or clinical medicine. Students are encouraged to begin their research in the spring semester of their first year or during the summer between their first and second years. It is strongly recommended that they continue their work during some of the elective time in Y ears 3 and 4. Further information is av ailable from the Medical Student Research Office (MSRO). Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 135 July 2014 Residency Application Process The Residency Application Process is managed by the Office of Student Affairs. The process begins in the second half of third -year and continues until Match Day in March of fourth -year. There are two processes: 1. Application: Most programs use the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) for application processing. The SF Match Programs (generally used by those going into ophthalmology) use the Central Appli cation Service (CAS). Urology is now a participating residency program in ERAS as well as all U.S. Army, Air Force & Navy PGY -1 residency programs. For Military applicants, you must still apply through the Joint Service Graduate Medical Education Selecti on Board as well. There is a separate match in Canada and students are encouraged to look online for additional information for those programs. Also, all early match participants will have to use ERAS when applying to the preliminary programs. 2. Match: There are several services that match applicants' and programs' preferences for each other to determine residency placements. a. ALL STUDENTS MUST REGISTER WITH THE NATIONAL RESIDENCY MATCHING PROGRAM (NRMP), including early match students. b. The SF Match pro gram currently serves these residencies: Ophthalmology, neurotology and some plastic surgery programs. c. Although urology is using ERAS as their application service, urology applicants will enter a unique match which is early and run by the AUA. Information about the AUA match can be found on their website: http://www.auanet.org/education/residency.cfm . All senior students applying for first -year graduate level training must be appointed through the NRMP, unless an early match student as noted above. The deans of all schools and the academic societ ies have agreed that the Medical Student Performance Evaluation may not be sent, before October 1. There will be no exceptions. This includes the early Matches. The NRMP and the specialty matching plans have changed their timetables accordingly. Students a re honor -bound to reject offers of contracts for appointment prematurely, in keeping with the NRMP agreements they have signed. The determination of medical students to present a united front and to be deliberate in their choice of graduate appointments is the key to success of the plan. Similarly, institutions and their program directors are honor- bound not to entice students to accept contracts for appointments prematurely, in keeping with the agreements they have previously signed with NRMP. ALL STUDENTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO REPORT VIOLATIONS OF THE NRMP TO THE OFFICE OF STUDENT AFFAIRS. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 136 July 2014 Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) The format and composition for the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) for Icahn School of Medicine conforms to th e guidelines established by the AAMC Dean's Letter Advisory Committee, 2002. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai considers the MSPE a comprehensive assessment and should be considered a narrative transcript. It is a compilation of the aggregate of ach ievements during medical school. The MSPE is automatically generated from the following: Information from the student's portfolio, information from the student database, information submitted by the curricular leaders with all written comments composed by the curriculum office and is NOT composed by Student Affairs . This information is compiled by Student Affairs staff and is presented as required by the AAMC, as comparative performance information relative to a student's peers, in achieving the educational objectives of the medical school curriculum. The MSPE is neither a letter of recommendation nor the school's prediction of the student's future performance in a residency program. In compiling the MSPE, only activities, including research activitie s, initiated after entry into medical school will qualify for inclusion in the MPSE. Activities begun earlier should be included in the student's CV and ERAS, and may be mentioned in letters of recommendation or, if relevant, brought up by the student du ring an interview. Name and Purpose The Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) is what was formerly known as the Dean's Letter. The MSPE describes, in a sequential manner, a student's performance, as compared to that of his/her peers, through three full years of medical school and, to some degree, the fourth year. The MSPE includes an assessment of both the student's academic performance and professional attributes. Composition Final authority for composing the MSPE rests with the Department of Medic al Education leadership team; the MSPE is submitted to a committee of the Deans and Student Affairs for final approval. The process for the MSPE includes student completion of the portfolio and a personal meeting of each student with their Faculty Adviso r. Also included in the process are review and update periods for sections of the MSPE, as well as a final review of the full MSPE before it is released to programs. Content The MSPE contains six sections: 1. Identifying Information: a. Student's legal name b. Name and location of the medical school 2. Unique Characteristics: This section includes a brief statement about the unique characteristics of the student: Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 137 July 2014 a. Brief biographical narrative b. Entry type (e.g. Humanities and Medicine, MSTP) c. Awards d. Leadership, commun ity service and extracurricular activities 3. Academic History: a. The month and year of the student's initial matriculation in, and expected graduation from, medical school. b. An explanation based on school -specific policies, of any extensions, leave(s) of abse nce, gap(s), or break(s) in the student's educational program. c. Information about the student's prior, current, or expected enrollment in, and the month and year of the student's expected graduation from, dual, joint, or combined degree programs. d. Information, based upon school -specific policies, of coursework that the student was required to repeat or otherwise remediate during the student's medical educator. e. Information, based on school -specific policies, of any adverse action(s) imposed on the student by the medical school or its parent institution. 4. Academic Progress: This section includes information about the student's academic performance and professional attributes in preclinical/basic science coursework and core clinical and elective rotat ions, as follows: a. Templated narrative information regarding grading in the pre -clerkship courses followed by documentation of student's completion of this curriculum b. Narrative information regarding the student's overall performance on each core clinical clerkship. This information is written by the curriculum leaders and is not modified in any way by Student Affairs except for grammatical errors. Any challenge to the narrative must be taken to the clerkship director. At the student's request, the Medica l Education Leadership Team may review and modify a comment (e.g. \"this student was quiet\"). This information should be provided in the chronological order in which the student completed each core clinical clerkship. 5. Research: The Icahn School of Medici ne MSPE includes an extensive review of scholarly work which is included just prior to the final summary statement. Scholarly work and research must have taken place during years one through three of medical school. No work from prior to medical school may be included. 6. Summary: The summary section includes a summative assessment, based upon the school's evaluation system, of the student's comparative performance in medical school. The Summary Statement is Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 138 July 2014 determined by a numerical system that takes int o consideration the USMLE Step I score, Gold Humanism Honor Society, clerkship grades, research publications, school leadership and community service. The numerical grading system is assessed, then the scoring sheet is created to be anonymous and the Med ical Education Leadership Team determines cut -offs for each quartile blinded to all students' identity. 7. Appendices: Appendices, as per AAMC guidelines, are included with the exception that no graphs are provided for comparative performance in Y ears 1 and 2 due to our commitment to the pass/fail curriculum. Appendix C (professionalism) is provided in narrative form. a. Appendix A: List of courses taken in Years 1 and 2. b. Appendix B: A graph of each clerkship indicating the distribution of h onors/high pass/pass/fail and the student's grade in the clerkship. c. Appendix C: Narrative including the School's required competency in Professionalism. Incident Reports and Commendations are included here. d. Appendix D: This is a requirement of the AAMC. The student's quartile is determined by committee based on the parameters noted above. e. Appendix E: Description of school curriculum and requirements (same for each student). Student Review The MSPE, as an institutional assessment, is considered a component of the students' academic record and, thus, must be available for a student's review. The student is permitted to correct factual errors in the MSPE, but not to revise evaluative statements in the MSPE. Mode of Delivery The MSPE will be delivered via ERAS , or a specialty matching program (SF Match, Canadian Match) in a computer file compatible with an Internet -based delivery system. Release Date The MSPE release date will be October 1, as per the national agreement. Student Portfolio Each Icahn School of Medicine student has access to their unique portfolio on Blackboard. Students may log-in at any time to record activities in school leadership, in community service or in scholarly endeavors. The information reported will be utilized to create the MSPE at the end of Year 3. Please note that once a MSPE has been generated, Student Affairs will no longer access the student's portfolio. No changes need to be made after the student has attended a MSPE meeting. "}
