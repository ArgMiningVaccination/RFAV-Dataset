But 90% Efficacy Is a True Game-Changer. What I hear in Pfizer's promising vaccine news I can't resist offering a few quick takes on the [latest Pfizer vaccine news](https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/09/covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-and-biontech-is-strongly-effective-early-data-from-large-trial-indicate/): 90% efficacy is far better than even the most optimistic projections. An election analogy that captures the \"margin of victory\" \u2014 these are like California results for Biden/Harris, rather than Pennsylvania results. Efficacy and safety The 90% refers to preventing symptomatic disease (that is, fever, cough). But we don't know yet how well this vaccine prevents severe symptoms that lead to hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and death. Knowing that will be key. It seems likely it will hold up well, but that still needs to be demonstrated. Now that the efficacy data are out, the next big question is safety. The need to wait two months to observe at least half the volunteers is the reason the vaccine won't be ready to be considered by the FDA for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) until later this month. But there are some early signs regarding safety that are promising. Namely, three other vaccine trials (conducted by Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, and AstraZeneca) were [suspended at various times](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10099143/covid-vaccine-clinical-trials-pause) to analyze safety concerns. The Pfizer study was never suspended, making it unlikely that we'll see a high enough number of severe side effects to derail the vaccine's eventual approval. Even if there's a rare side effect (which remains a possibility), 90% efficacy is so strong that the overarching risk-benefit equation will still be positive for use among at-risk populations. But for people at relatively low risk (of catching Covid and, if they do, of a bad outcome), we need to be sure it's super safe. While we're most worried about severe side effects, it's also good to know that the experience with the Pfizer vaccine to date is that the local reactions immediately after vaccination are relatively benign \u2014 perhaps a little worse than from the flu vaccine. While a more significant local reaction (that is, flu-like symptoms or pain at the injection site) might not prevent the vaccine from being approved by the FDA, it could discourage people from taking the vaccine, which...
