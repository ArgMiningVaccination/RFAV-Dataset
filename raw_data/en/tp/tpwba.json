Second Edition. Author: Teddy H. Spence, DDS, ND. About the Author: Dr. Ted H. Spence has completed many studies in the fields of nutrition, herbology, and naturopathy. He has been a general dentist for over 30 years, has had a nutritional practice since 1992 and he is licensed and board certified in Naturopathy. In 1999, Dr. Spence completed studies at a Natural Health Clinic in Mexico where he received extensive clinical training in herbology, homeopathy and naturopathy. Dr. Spence has done comprehensive research into the damaging effects of vaccinations and how they upset nature's balance for good immunity. Although his original vaccination research was done over 14 years ago, it has not been disputed in any way. Since that time Dr. Spence has found more research articles showing that vaccines are harmful to our bodies and damage our immune system. Comparing the health of vaccinated children to unvaccinated children revealed the real harm of vaccinations. During these studies he became aware that vaccines are very unsafe, extremely unhealthy and largely ineffective. Do vaccinations contribute to increased cancers, AIDS and other debilitating diseases? What he uncovered was startling and led to his search for truth among the lies. What he discovered is in this book: Vaccination Deception: How Vaccines Prevent Optimal Health! - Softbound. 129 pages.
