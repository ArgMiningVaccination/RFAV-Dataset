The Council has taken up various Research Oriented Health Care activities in order to provide Ayurveda Health care services to the door step of public, thus imparting Ayurveda to the grass root level and to study the demography of the area adopted. Presently Council has undertaken five major Programs viz. Tribal Health Care Research Program (THCRP), Ayurveda Mobile Health Care Program under Scheduled Castes Sub Plan (SCSP), Swasthya Rakshan Program (SRP), North East Health Program and National Program National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS). Tribal Health Care Research Program (THCRP) was initiated by CCRAS in 1982 through its 15 Institutes/units. To educate, protect and promote health for preventing, identifying and treating the disease related to poor hygiene and sanitation in SC Population, Ayurveda Mobile Health Care Program under Scheduled Castes Sub Plan (SCSP) was taken up by CCRAS on October, 2015 through 20 Institutes/units. In the same month, in order to promote health and health education in villages, Swasthya Rakshan Program (SRP) was also taken up by CCRAS in its 21 units/centers. Later in February 2016, with an aim to extend and sensitize public in North East India toward Ayurveda and to extend Healthcare services in that region, 10 Ayurvedic Sub centre at 3 peripheral institutes of CCRAS Institutes were started with a plan to further extend it. All these programs are successfully working and providing health care services. Another maj or milestone was achieved by the Council by successfully integrating Ayurveda with Yoga and conventional system of Medicine in the management of Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) through National Program National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) in 2015. The program is currently taken up by the Council in three states through its three peripheral units/ Institutes. The program is showing very promising results in the management and preventions of these NCDs. This comprehensive document provides a glimpse of all the Research Oriented Health Care Services being provided by the Councils since their inception. It will help the readers to know about various strength areas of Ayurveda and a quintessential of various programs, their objectives and how they are executed and the output and will help as a ready document for understanding role of Ayurveda in providing Health care services in India by CCRAS. i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Ayurveda, the science oflife, evolved as a comprehensive system ofhealthcare systematically through scientific experimentations of high order backed by sound and reproducible evidence base and stood the test of the time. Several strategies and road maps are being drawn to carry forward merits of this science so as to meet the current day health needs and mainstream its core strengths alongside through research & development in this country and across the globe. The Council is proving Health care services through its Research Oriented Health Care Services in many parts of the country. Presently Council has undertaken five major Programs viz. Tribal Health Care Research Program (THCRP), Ayurveda Mobile Health Care Program under Scheduled Castes Sub Plan (SCSP), Swasthya Rakshan Program (SRP), North East Health Program and National Program National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS). Tribal Health Care Research Program (THCRP) was initiated by Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) in 1982 with the core objectives encompassing to study the living conditions of tribal people including health related demography, documentation of folk claims and Local Health Traditions and use of common medicinal plants in the area, availability of medicinal plants in the area, propagation of knowledge about hygiene and prevention of diseases besides extending medical aid at their door steps. Currently, the Tribal Health Care Research Program is being executed in 14 States through 15 (previously through 16) peripheral Institutes of CCRAS under Tribal sub-Plan (TSP). The Ministry of AYUSH has taken forward by initiating \"Scheduled Caste Sub Plan Program (SCSP)\", launched in October, 2015, so as to educate, protect and promote health for preventing, identifying and treating the disease related to poor hygiene and sanitation in SC Population. The program was initiated through CCRAS. The Central Council for Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), New Delhi implemented \"Scheduled Caste Sub Plan (SCSP)\" in 19 State through its 20 peripheral institutes. Through this programme special emphasis is giving on collection of the demographic information of the particular area. The focus is on socio-economic information, food habits, lifestyle, etc. of people and patients of that particular region. 'Swasthya Rakshan Programme'was also launched by Ministry of AYUSH in October 2015 to promote health and health education in villages. The main objective of the program is to take care of the health of the people in villages and also to promote knowledge and awareness about health all around. i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll The North East Health program was implemented with starting of 10 health centers as Extension centers of RARIGID, Guwahati (Assam) 6 health centers ofARRI Health Centres of RARI, Gangtok (Sikkim). The program is running under the supervision of concerned institutes in their states. The program is doing commendable job in providing healthcare facility through Ayurveda to the rural & urban population through OPDs, creating awareness about hygiene of self and surrounding environment, distribution of IEC and screening and referral of select research cases. Keeping the strength of AYUSH systems for prevention and management of NCDs by promoting healthy lifestyle, \"Integration of AYUSH (Ayurveda) with National Program National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) program\" was conceived in 2015 by Ministry of AYUSH & Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences in collaboration with Director General for Health Services, for imparting Health Services on Pilot basis. The program currently covers Districts of 3 states, viz. Bhilwara (Rajasthan), Surendranagar (Gujarat) and Gaya (Bihar). This program is showing encouraging benefits of stand-alone Ayurveda therapies as well as benefits as add-on therapies with conventional system of medicine and Yoga. The council has also laid its vision document 2030 with short term goal and long term goal in for achieving its objectives and further strengthening of scientifically validated Ayurveda for achieving the ultimate goal of 'Health for all' and these Research Oriented Health Care Program are playing major role in sensitizing public toward prevention of diseases and Ayurveda system of medicine. i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll CENTRAL COUNCIL FOR RESEARCH IN AYURVEDIC SCIENCES Information of Outreach activities S.

These systems were developed by ancient scholars on the basis of their own philosophy, oriental methodologies and practices prevalent in that era and have popularised and almost completed it in all aspects as a system of medicine. The advent of foreign invasions and cross cultural interaction had definite impact on these systems. The beginning of twentieth century saw efforts to revive these systems. The members of the Imperial Legislative Council got the resolution of investigations and recognition of these systems was accepted in the year 1916. The Indian National Congress also passed similar resolution in 1920. This led to establishment to number of colleges of Ayurveda. In the post independence era, the efforts to develop research gained momentum. As per recommendation of the various Committees, grant-in-aid projects were sanctioned to selected colleges. The Central Council for Ayurvedic Research as an Advisory body was established in 1962 and finally the Central Council for Research in Indian medicine & Homoeopathy (CCRIM&H) was established in 1969. This Council initiated research programmes in the Indian systems of Medicine & Homoeopathy in different parts of the country and started coordination at the National level for the first time. The Central Council for Research in Ayurveda & Siddha (CCRAS), an apex body for the formulation, coordination and development of research in Ayurveda & Siddha on scientific lines was established in March 1978 after reorganization of CCRIM&H. The Minister of Health & Family Welfare is the President of the Governing Body of the Council while the Joint Secretary chairs the Standing Finance Committee. The Scientific /Research Programmes are supervised by the respective Scientific Advisory Committee chaired by eminent scholars of the system. The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences is a Registered Society under Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860 on 29.07.2011 (Formerly Registered as Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha on 30th March, 1978). Research areas The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic sciences (CCRAS), an autonomous body under Ministry of AYUSH, Govt, of India is apex body in India for undertaking, coordinating, formulating, developing and promoting research on scientific lines in Ayurvedic sciences. The activities are carried out through its 30 Institutes/Centres/Units located all over India and also through collaborative studies with various Universities, Hospitals and Institutes.

The program has been continued at 6 States Madhya from 1982 to till 2014. During this period, 5 independent Tribal Health Care research Units have been relocated through reorganization which came into force in the year 2000. Further during the year 2014-15 and 2016-17 the program has been extended in 10 more States viz. Rajasthan, Jammu & Kashmir, and Telengana. Currently, the Tribal Health Care Research Program is being executed in 14 States through 15 Peripheral Institutes of CCRAS under Tribal sub-Plan (TSP). Introduction India enjoys the distinction of having the largest network of traditional health care, which are fully functional with a network of registered practitioners, research institutions and licensed pharmacies. With its kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage, India is proud of some unique medicinal forms that look at health, disease and causes of disease in completely different ways. Best known as the Indian System of Medicine, its focus is on holistic health and well\u00ad being of humans. The AYUSH systems (Indian systems of medicine) have age-old acceptance in the communities in India and in most places they form the first line of treatment in case of common ailments. Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) are recognized systems of medicine and have been integrated into the national health delivery system. O f these, Ayurveda is the most ancient medical system with an impressive record of safety and efficacy. AYUSH represents the tradition of codified, textual health knowledge systems other than the modem, while Local Health Traditions (LHT) represent the practices and knowledge of the common people and folk practitioners who follow an oral tradition of learning and passing on of the knowledge Planned development of health services in the public system began in India after independence, based primarily on modem medical science (Bhore Committee Report, 1946). AYUSH services have been viewed as one way of ensuring access to some form of health care to the rural and poor population groups who are underserved by the dominant system. However, with the dominance of modem medicine over the past century, there has been a drastic decline in the legitimacy and services of the other systems. Now, with the enhanced recognition of their complementary strengths, there is resurgence of utilization of Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (TCAM), by the well-off of developed as well as the better-off of the developing countries. With concerns of equity and access in health care, a serious question arises about the availability and access of quality AYUSH services and Local Health Traditions (LHT) for all.VOLUME-V 6 Research Oriented Health Care Services 1 I N I I I N I I I N I I N I I I N I I I N I I I I I I I N I I I N I I I N I I N I I I N I I I N I I I N I I N I I I N I I I N I I I I I I I N I I I N I I I N I I N I I I N I I I N I I I I I I I N I I I N I I I N I I I I I I I N I The most prevalent users ofAYUSH, Traditional Medicine(TM), Complementary andAltemative Medicine (CAM) are individuals who have incurable, non-life-threatening conditions that may be chronic. The second largest groups of users are those struggling with chronic, potentially life-threatening diseases, such as cancer and HIV-AIDS. Both groups turn to CAM systems for a variety of reasons, such as to improve immune functioning, to improve overall functioning, to increase quality of life, to cope with side effects from conventional therapies, and to relieve symptoms related to their illness. Several studies and surveys across India also substantiate these facts. Even though for few common and acute conditions like cold, cough etc are being tackle by house hold remedies, LHTs etc. especially at primary lev el, utilization and preference has been evenly distributed for Chronic illness. Study on Role of AYUSH and Local Health Traditions under National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in 18 states across India, Implications of the NRHM strategy of mainstreaming AYUSH were studied. The pivotal outcomes and perceptions conclude that 80-90% households aware about utility of AYUSH/LHTs, Co-located services are well utilized in some states ,preference was for Chronic illness followed by acute illness and Health promotion. Tribal Health-Indian scenario: India is a canvas portraying a unique assimilation of ethnic groups displaying varied cultures and religions. In fact, this uniqueness in the ethnicity of the country is the factor that makes it different from other nations. Moreover, the vastness of India's nationalism, accounting to a plethora of cultural extravaganza, religions, etc. is the reason that the country is seen more as a seat for a major world civilization than a mere nation-state. The ethnic diversity in the country is represented by as many as 400 ethnic groups including the tribes and others. The tribal population is almost 7.5% of the total population of the country. Due to inaccessibility to modem health care, the real knowledge of the usages of plants lies with the rural population of the country consisting of tribes, forest dwellers and many villagers. The fact that tribal and forest dwellers have unique knowledge of therapeutic use of plants. Since ancient times, the spiritual land of India has displayed varied hues of culture, religion, race, language, and so on. This variety in race, culture, religion, etc. accounts for the existence of different ethnic groups who, although, live within the sanctums of one single nation, profess different social habits and characteristics. Regional territories in India play an important role in differentiating these ethnic groups, with their own social and cultural identities.. With the governance of different states and union territories in the country, there has originated a sense of regionalism amongst the various parts, with different states displaying different cultures, which although eventually fuse through a common bond to showcase a national cultural identity. The use of plants or animal products for healing is as old as human civilization. The relationship between man and plant is inseparable and it can be said that humanity at large cannot survive without using the plants, in one way or other. Our country has rich floristic and ethnic diversity. It harbours nearly 45,000 species of both higher and lower group of plants, which included 15,000 higher plants. The modem human civilization, urbanization/developmental activities and industrialization are gradually destroying the heritage of this unique knowledge of medicinal use of plant drugs. CCRAS initiatives in documenting and reporting Health Care seeking attitude and documentation of Local Health Traditions: Very little information is available on the utilization of Indian systems of medicine and homoeopathy (ISM&H) in India. The Central Council for Research Ayurveda and Siddha has conducted a survey in 12 states across the country on various aspects of health related demography during various periods (PublishedVOLUME-V Research Oriented Health Care Services I I N I I I N I I N I I I N I I I N I I I I I I I N I I I N I I I N I I N I I I N I I I N I I I N I I N I I I N I I I N I I I I I I I N I I I N I I I N I I N I I I N I I I N I I I N I I N I I I N I I I N I I I I I I I N I I I N I I report on \"Study of Health Statistics under Mobile Clinical Research Program, 1987, CCRAS, New Delhi). This is evident from the fact that out of the total population studied by all the Mobile Clinical Research Units with regard to the treatment received through various codified Systems of Medicine, during the study period, 71.34% of the population received Ayurvedic treatment, 24.67% Allopathic, 2.33% with others, i.e., with folk medicines, 1.65% with Homeopathy and 0.01% with Siddha System. In addition to these recognized system, folk medicines in the villages still play a major role to provide medical assistance in the rural areas. During the study period nearly 2.33% of the population was found to have used folk medicines. Among the population studied by various units, in Joginder Nagar -Himachal Pradesh the highest number of people, i.e. 14.09% received folk medicines for treatment, followed by of the cases was found to have used folk medicines for their treatment. Further, the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS,)documented Ethno- medical practices, use of medicinal plants besides studying living conditions of tribal areas across the country from Trans-Himalayan region, North-eastern India to southern parts of the country and Andaman & Nicobar through its 18 Survey of Units, Mobile Clinic Research Units, Tribal Health Care Research Program. The authenticity of the information is confirmed by cross examination of the treated patients, and specimens of plants/part(s) used were kept in record as herbariums/museum specimens. About 2500 Folklore/Ethno-medical claims used by tribes have been documented. The tribes used to simple diseases/conditions ranging from common cold, cough, fever, vomiting, skin diseases, digestive problems, reproductive and child health problems, wounds etc. The use of herbs for contraception is also prevalent among them. In addition to the above the Council has documented reported medical practices on prevention, management of vector borne and infectious diseases through Ayurveda and Siddha through 17 institutes across different states of the country. The information is gathered from various sources viz. Ayurvedic colleges, physicians from Ayurveda, Siddha hospitals, dispensaries, clinics, private physicians, local healers, NGOs, etc. has been systematically recorded. A number successful treatment episode on malaria, filariasis, chikungunya etc. has been recorded from the physician's experiences. Material and Methods The physical achievements including the beneficiaries of health care services, details of villages, tribal's pockets covered, documentation of disease prevalence and local health traditions during period 1982-2016 were compiled summarized and presented based on the information available in the published monographs, technical reports and annual reports of CCRAS. Observations and physical achievements Tribal Health Care Research Program (THCRP) has been initiated by Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) in 1982 with the core objectives encompassing , Study of the living conditions of tribal people, documentation of information Availability and use of medicinal plants in the area, study of dietetic habits and including health related demography, study of Socio-demographic profile, nature and frequency of prevalent diseases, propagation of knowledge about hygiene, and prevention of diseases, providing medical aid at their door steps collection and documentation of folklore claims and Local Health Traditions.VOLUME-V Research Oriented Health Care Services 8 1 I N I I I N I I I N I I N I I I N I I I N I I I I I I I N I I I N I I I N I I N I I I N I I I N I I I N I I N I I I N I I I N I I I I I I I N I I I N I I I N I I N I I I N I I I N I I I I I I I N I I I N I I I N I I I I I I I N I Chronological Developments: The program has been continued at 6 from 1982 to till 2014.

The ethnic diversity in the country is represented by as many as 400 ethnic groups including the tribes and others-. There has been wide difference in health infrastructure, facilities influencing the healthcare delivery across different regions and ethnic groups. In addition to cultural beliefs, knowledge, sustainability in AYUSH specific healthcare delivery certainly has great impact on the health seeking attitude and utilization of AYUSH and other LHTs. Very little information is available on the utilization of AYUSH Systems and other local health traditions in India.

These safeguards are in the nature of protective from discrimination for their Educational, Economic, Social, Political and reservation benefits and for their overall development. The Government of India is committed for the upliftment and development of all the weaker sections of society, particularly the scheduled castes. As part of the socioeconomic and financial inclusion strategy of the Government to ensure that all segments of the society, particularly the Scheduled castes, should be benefited. The Government allocates funds across Ministries/ Departments for different schemes where targeted financial and physical benefits can accrue to the Scheduled Castes. In the mid- 1970s, the Special Component Plan and Tribal Sub Plan were initiated. Tribal Sub -Plans and Special Component Plans was an integral part of Annual Plans as well as Five Year Plans, making provisions therein non divertible and non- lapsable, with the clear objective of bridging the gap in socio-economic development of the SCs and STs within a period of 10 years\". A dedicated unit was constituted in every Central Ministry/Department for the welfare and development of SCs (and STs) as nodal unit for formulation and implementation of SCSP (and TSP).The strategy of Scheduled Caste Sub Plan (SC-SP) (earlier known as Special Component Plan for Scheduled Castes) came in force since 1979-80, to ensure proportionate flow of plan resources for the development of Scheduled castes. The name of the present Scheme i.e. Scheduled Caste Sub Plan (SC-SP) also came under since 2016. The allocation for the welfare of Scheduled Castes has been stepped up from Rs. 38,833 crores in BE 2016-17 to Rs. 52,392.55 crores in 2017-18, representing an increase of about 35%.\" The Government will introduce outcome based monitoring of expenditure in these sectors by the NITI Aayog (www.e-utthaan.gov.in). The Ministry of AYUSH has taken forward by initiating \"SCHEDULED CASTE SUB PLAN PROGRAMME (SCSP)\", launched in October, 2015, so as to educate, protect and promote health for preventing, identifying and treating the disease related to poor hygiene and sanitation in SC Population. The programme was initiated through Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Science (CCRAS). Aims and objectives of the programme are as follows: 1. Provide medical aid at door steps of SC community 2. Study of the living condition of the SC people 3. Study of dietetic habits 4. Collection of its Socio-demographic profile 5. Prevalence of diseases and collection of information related to health status. 6. Propagation of knowledge about hygiene and prevention of diseases 7. Propagation of Ayurveda concepts on preventive health in relation to Patyaapathya and Sadvritta etc. 8. Collection and documentation of folk medicines/ claims.

Through this programme special emphasis is giving on collection of the demographic information of the particular area. The focus is on socio-economic information, food habits, lifestyle, etc. of people and patients of that particular region. In addition, the OPDs and Camps are being organized in each village/ selected area on a weekly basis where qualified doctor assess the patient and provide suitable treatment/ medicine for various disease conditions. During the survey Health Camps are organized where Medicines are distributed at free of cost and people are advised for hygiene and prevention of diseases and Ayurveda concepts on preventive health in relation to Patyaapathya and Sadvritta. To implement this programme Institutes were directed to identify areas where schedule caste population is more. A dedicated team with separate additional manpower is constituted at each Institute to implement and expedite the work.

The main objective of the programme is to take care of the health of the people in villages and also to promote knowledge and awareness about health all around. The health care services are the essential part of health, provided at the first level of contact of the individual or the family with the national health system .As per WHO's definition health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infinity. It was also emphasized that the key to attain the goal of heath for all was through the implementation of health care services. \"Health for All\", means that health should be within reach of everyone in a given country. And by \"health\" is meant a personal state of wellbeing, not just the availability of health services - a state of health that enables a person to lead a socially and economically productive life. Health for All implies the removal of the obstacles to health - that is to say, the elimination of malnutrition, ignorance, contaminated drinking water and unhygienic housing. Ayurveda the holistic health care system deals with preventive and curative aspects of health. Ayurveda focuses on dietetics, routine activities, hygiene, conduct etc which if adopted can prevent many diseases.

Every year, 15 million people die from a NCD between the ages of 30 and 69 years; over 80% of these \"premature\" deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Cardiovascular diseases account for most NCD deaths, followed by Cancers (8.8 million), respiratory diseases (3.9million), and Diabetes (1.6 million).These 4 groups of diseases account for over 80% of all premature NCD deaths. It is projected that globally NCDs will account for nearly 44 million deaths in 2020 (Global status report on non-communicable diseases 2010 ). In India, as per the NCD country profile 2014 published by World Health Organization (WHO), overall mortality due to NCDs was 60%. The disease specific share was for Cardiovascular Diseases-26%, Cancers-7%, Diabetes-2%, COPD-13%, Other NCDs-12%. Based on National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP) of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), it is estimated that there are about 28 lakh cases of different types of Cancer in the country with new occurrence, about 11 lakh cases and about 5 lakh deaths annually. The three most prevalent cancers in India are breast, cervical and oral cancers. NCDs are caused, to a larger extent, by four behavioural risk factors which are pervasive aspects of economic transition, rapid urbanization and 21st-century lifestyles: tobacco use, unhealthy diet, insufficient physical activity and the excessive use of alcohol. The greater effects of these risk factors fall increasingly on low and middle-income countries, and on poor people within all countries, mirroring the underlying socioeconomic determinants. Ayurveda, food ( Pathya & Apathya ), life style ( Vihara ) play a key role in the maintenance of health and in prevention of many diseases. This includes advocacy on food items (Qualitative & Quantitative), according to the disease. Further, the daily routine activities ( Dinacharya ) such as dental care, oil massage, Yoga, Physical activities, Good conduct, Mental health and seasonal routine for maintenance of health are also described. Ayurveda emphasises the practice of healthy life style for healthy persons to prevent diseases and specific life style modifications for different diseases to arrest the progress of the disease and complications. It was viewed that the potential of this unique contribution of Ayurveda may be adopted for the prevention of NCDs through food and life style counselling. Detection, screening and management of NCDs, as well as prevention of complications, are key components of therapeutic approach to NCDs. INTRODUCTION Government of India launched \"National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardio-vascular diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS)\" in 2008 to prevent and control the projected increase in the burden of Non-Communicable Diseases. This program has been implemented in 36 States by Directorate of Health Services. The National Policy on Indian Systems of Medicine and Homeopathy adopted in 2002, suggested phase wise integration of ISM with health delivery systems.

During the past decade, the global emergence of integrative medicine has established that India has the potential to become a world leader in this sphere, if adequate support & opportunities for Research and Development is given the Integration will enable patients to choose the appropriate interventions. The ministry also desires to generate the health data of population in relation to various disease preventive factors described in AYUSH systems. AYUSH doctors can play a vital role in prevention and control of NCDs through primary health care network. Keeping the strength of AYUSH systems for prevention and management of NCDs by promoting healthy lifestyle, \" Integration o f AYUSH (Ayurveda) with NPCDCS programme\" was conceived in 2015 by Ministry of AYUSH & Central Council For Research In Ayurvedic Sciences in collaboration with Director General for Health Services, for imparting Health Services on Pilot basis. This would initially cover Districts of 3 states, viz. Bhilwara (Rajasthan), Surendranagar (Gujarat) and Gaya (Bihar). The Jan/Feb in 2 viz. Bhilwara (Rajasthan), Surendranagar (Gujarat) whereas in Gaya (Bihar) the programme was launched on April 2016. OBJECTIVES To integrate Ayurveda to the existing healthcare system for promotion, prevention and control of non-communicable diseases through NPCDCS program.

State Health authorities also participated in the training programme and emphasized the significance of Integration and the importance of working in coordination for the success of the programme. Various lectures on the NCDs like Diabetes, Hypertension, Dyslipidemia, Cancer etc. and the methodology to be adopted were imparted in this programme for better understanding and to work in a coordinated manner with a team spirit. MODUS OPERANDI FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAMME Screening of the NCD patients The patients attending the AYUSH NPCDCS clinic at District Hospital/CHC level are being thoroughly screened for NCDs. Further, the health camps are also being organized at PHC level of selected Districts on regular interval to screen the general population for NCDs and to sensitize them about the role of the faulty dietetic habits and lifestyles responsible for increasing incidence of NCDs along with creating awareness about the preventive measures to prevent the NCDs. A format has also been developed for the screening. Facility for regular Yoga practice The Yoga Asanas are being demonstrated and regularly put in to practice by the Yoga Instructors at CHCs and District Hospitals level for the susceptible/ diagnosed patients of NCDs. At each PHC level two volunteers (one male and one female) have been identified and trained by the Yoga Instructor who in turn provide regular yoga practices to general public at village level. Treatm ent protocol for NCDs through Ayurveda Based on the screening, the subjects who were identified to be in the risk zone of NCDs or established NCD patients have been registered in to two cohorts i.e. Pre disease group (A) and Disease group (B) and further sub divided in to treatment groups A l, A2 & B l, B2. The patients in the early stages of NCDs mainly of Diabetes, Hypertension and Dyslipidemia have been focused. The case record forms (CRFs) have been designed for recording the data of registered patients.

Bhilwada, Surendra Nagar and Gaya of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Bihar states respectively by CCRAS through Ministry of AYUSH and DGHS and the study is continuing. An interim analysis has revealed that the dosage or components of conventional medicines/ prescription were either reduced or discontinued, in consultation and supervision of Modem doctors, after integrating the intervention of Ayurveda, lifestyle modification & Yoga in patients of Diabetes, Hypertension and Dyslipidemia. Ayurveda - Modem medicine integrative health care services seems to be successful attempt of functional integration through delivering in the context of Non-communicable diseases with encouraging benefits of stand-alone Ayurveda therapies as well as benefits as add-on therapies. Present Integration of AYUSH with NPCDCS programme at grass root level will be a useful tool for future action plan and to take appropriate policy decisions for Integration which will further help to control and manage the disease burden. Strengthening of Health Care network by utilizing the services of AYUSH doctors can be adopted for the prevention and control of NCDs through primary health care network.
