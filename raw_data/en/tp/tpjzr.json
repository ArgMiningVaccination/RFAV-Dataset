This is welcome news for families and their younger children who have had to face the prospect of getting sick and have had to avoid many of their regular activities. Federal health authorities have authorized the Moderna vaccine for children ages 6 months through 5 years, and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children ages 6 months through 4 years. The Pfizer vaccine requires three doses; the Moderna vaccine requires two doses. Pfizer's vaccine was authorized for children ages 5 and over last November; the Moderna vaccine has now also been authorized for the 5-17 age group. In this Q&A, [Lindsey C. Douglas, MD, MSCR](https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/lindsey-douglas), a pediatrician at Mount Sinai Kravis Children's Hospital, explains why parents should get their young kids vaccinated as soon as possible. Dr. Douglas is Medical Director, Children's Quality and Safety, and Pediatric Hospital Medicine, and she is also Associate Professor of Pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Why should I get the vaccine for my child six months to five years of age? What are the benefits and risks? We're really excited that the vaccine has been approved for children six months to five years of age, so now nearly all children can get vaccinated. The vaccine does, in fact, reduce the chances that a child will get COVID-19. Many people who have looked at the data believe the reduction doesn't seem to be that much. But we know that the vaccine reduces the chance that a child will get severe COVID, and that is really important. Children are being hospitalized with COVID-19, and that is something we worry about. Also, the vaccine will help us truly get back to normal, with children being able to be around other children, around their grandparents, and reducing the risks of transmission in general. We hope this will get us back to where we were before the pandemic, so that we can all gather together and not be as worried about COVID-19. Two vaccines are recommended. What are the differences and does it matter which vaccine I get? We have some information about both of them. There were studies that were done for the authorization by the Food and Drug Administration, and the two vaccines seem to have similar efficacy. However, the doses are different, and the timing is different. There are three doses for the Pfizer vaccine and two doses for the Moderna vaccine. My recommendation is to get the one that's easiest for you to get, the one that's available at your pediatrician. The differences are probably not as important as the difference between having the vaccine and not having the vaccine. You can talk with your pediatrician if you have other questions. Will children experience any side effects? Side effects have been quite minimal, and they're similar to other vaccines, which include soreness at the site of the shot, and some children experienced fevers and body aches. I like to think of these as proof that the vaccine is working, that your immune system is actually activated and working. What can I do about these side effects? You can give your young child acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin). They can help with fever and muscle aches. Some medications, such as ibuprofen, work as anti-inflammatory medications, whereas acetaminophen does not. Some believe anti-inflammatory medications may also block the immune response. I have two children of my own who are between five and 11 and had the vaccine, and I tried to wait it out with them, so that they could have the most potent response. The symptoms typically last only about a day. If you need to use something, I suggest acetaminophen. What does the data show about how effective the vaccine is? The effectiveness of the vaccine was shown in how often a child would get COVID-19. But that's not the only thing that we worry about. The other thing that I worry about, as a pediatrician who takes care of hospitalized children, is preventing severe disease. There is not as much data on that, so it's something that each parent should think about. Preventing severe disease in children is really important, and so is getting back to school and playgroups and all of the things that smaller children need for their development. Those to me are equally as important as not getting COVID-19 at all. Are kids five and under at risk for serious disease? People believe children don't get COVID-19 as often or there are fewer cases of COVID-19 than in adults. That technically is true. More adults have been hospitalized. But there are children who have died from COVID-19. My opinion is this vaccine prevents both serious disease and hospitalization of a child, and that means it makes sense to get your child vaccinated. Why is there no vaccine for kids under six months? The studies for these vaccines were done in children over six months of age because the immune system is not fully formed in children under six months. We do start shots in infants as early as two months of age, but many vaccines can't be given until kids are older, including the chickenpox shot. We tend to be much more careful with vaccines in children under six months of age. If my child already had COVID-19, do they still need a vaccine? Unfortunately, getting COVID-19 doesn't prevent you from getting it again. I recommend that a child who has had COVID-19 be vaccinated. We know that vaccination is a strong way to prevent disease and prevent severe disease, and having some natural immunity from having the disease also provides some protection. The combination of the two is even better. Is there anything else that patients and consumers should know? The COVID-19 vaccines have been available for quite some time now. Kids under five are not that much different from those older than five. As a pediatrician, and as a parent myself, I'm thrilled that we can offer the vaccine to our most vulnerable and youngest children. This age group has been out of school the most of any age group because of not being eligible for the vaccine and not being able to wear masks easily. I urge parents to consider getting their children vaccinated today. "}
