Adjusted results are a non -IFRS measure that may be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, information presented in acc ordance with IFRS. Adjus ted results are defined on page 10 and \u00a3% or AER% growth, CER% growth, free cash flow and other non -IFRS measures are defined on page 61.

Press release Q4 Results summary Total and Adjusted results Full year performance Quarterly performance Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 9 February 2022 , London, U.K . 2 9 13 Total operating profit 6,201 (20) (9) 895 (16) 1 Total earnings per share 87.6p (24) (13) 15.0p 10 31 Adjusted operating profit 8,806 (1) 9 1,893 4 15 Adjusted earnings per share 113.2p (2) 9 25.6p 9 22 Net cash from operating activities 7,952 (6) 3,767 (2) Free cash flow 4,437 (18) 2,901 (7) 2022 guidance We set out below our guidance for new GSK in 2022. This guidance is provided at CER and excludes the commercial impact of COVID -19 solutions. In 2022 we expect to continue to deliver on our strategic priorities. We plan to increase targeted investment in R&D, to build on and invest behind our top line momentum for key growth drivers and to deliver the demerger of our Consumer Healthcare business in mid -year. Assuming global economies and healthcare systems approach normality as the year progresses, we e xpect sales of Specialty Medicines to grow approximately 10% at CER and sales of General Medicines to show a slight decrease, primarily reflecting increased genericisation of established Respiratory products. Vaccines sales are expected to grow at a low te ens percentage at CER for the year as a whole. However, governments' prioritisation of COVID -19 vaccination programmes and ongoing measures to contain the pandemic are expected to result in some continued disruption to adult immunisations, with the impact weighted to the first half. For Shingrix , despite the potential for short -term pandemic disruption, we continue to expect strong double -digit growth and record annual sales based on strong demand in existing markets and geographical expansion. Reflecting these factors, in 2022 for new GSK we expect sales to grow between 5% to 7% at CER and Adjusted operating profit to grow between 12% to 14% at CER as compared with 2021. This includes the future benefit in royalty income from the settlement and license agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) announced on 1 February 2022 . Medium term outlooks will be provided for Consumer Healthcare at a Capital Markets Day scheduled for 28 February 2022. Until such time as the formal criteria for treati ng Consumer Healthcare as a 'Discontinued operation' have been satisfied (currently expected in Q2 2022), GSK will continue to present the Consumer Healthcare business within 'Continuing operations' and will consolidate the business for reporting purposes until the demerger has completed . Dividend policies and expected pay -out ratios are unchanged for new GSK and new Consumer Healthcare (subject to new Consumer Healthcare board approval). The expected distribution per share for the new Consumer Healthcare Company for the second half of 2022 has been adjusted from that highlighted at the GSK Investor Update in June 2021 to reflect the total number of shares in the new Consumer Healthcare company that are expected to be in issue upon demerger. The future dividend policies and guidance in relation to the expected dividend pay -out in 2022 across both new GSK and new Consumer Healthcare are provided on page 43. 2022 COVID -19 solutions expectations In 2022, based on known binding agreements from governments we expect that COVID -19 solutions will contribute a similar sales level to 2021, but a substantially reduced profit contribution due to the increased proportion of lower margin Xevudy sales. We ex pect this to reduce new GSK Adjusted Operating profit growth (including COVID -19 solutions in both years) by between 5% to 7%. We continue to discuss further opportunities with governments. All expectations, guidance and targets regarding future performan ce and dividend payments should be read together with ' Guidance , assumptions and cautionary statements' on pages 62 and 63. If exchange rates were to hold at the closing rates on 31 January 2022 ($1.34/\u00a31, \u20ac1.20/\u00a31 and Yen 155/\u00a31) for the rest of 2022, the estimated impact on 2022 Sterling turnover growth for new GSK would be stable and if exchange gains or losses were recognised at the same level as in 2021, the estimated impact on 2021 Sterling Adjusted Operating Profit growth for new GSK would also be st able.

Press release Q4 Results summary Total and Adjusted results Full year performance Quarterly performance Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 9 February 2022 , London, U.K . 3 Operating performance - 2021 Turnover \u00a3m Growth \u00a3% Growth CER% Pharmaceuticals 17,729 4 10 Vaccines 6,778 (3) 2 Consumer Healthcare 9,607 (4) - Group turnover 34,114 - 5 Group turnover was \u00a334,114 million in the year, stable at AER but up 5% CER. Sales of COVID -19 solutions contributed approximately 4 percentage points to growth in the year. Pharmaceutical turnover in the year was \u00a317,729 million, up 4% AER and 10% CER. Sales of Xevudy , the monoclonal antibody treatment for COVID -19 of \u00a3958 million contributed approximately 6 percentage points to total Pharmaceuticals growth. Vaccines turnover was \u00a36,778 million in the year, down 3% AER but up 2% CER , primarily driven by pandemic adj uvant sales, partially offset by lower demand for routine adult vaccination due to COVID -19 vaccination programme deployment and disease circulation across regions. Vaccines turnover excluding pandemic vaccines dec reased 9% AER, 5% CER to \u00a36,331 million. Consumer Healthcare turnover was \u00a39,607 million, down 4% AER but remained stable at CER reflecting dilution from divestments given the completion of the portfolio rationalisation at the end of Q1 2021. Sales excluding brands divested/under review dec reased 1% AER but increased 4% CER reflecting the underlying strength of brands across the portfolio and categories and continuing growth in e -commerce. Operating profit Total operating profit was \u00a3 6,201 million compared with \u00a37,783 million in 2020. This primarily reflected an unfavourable comparison to the net profit on disposal in Q2 2020 of Horlicks and other Consumer brands and resultant sale of shares in Hindustan Unilever. This was partly offset by lower major restructuring costs, lower re-measurement charges on the contingent consideration liabilities and the unwind in 2020 of the fair market value uplift on inventory arising on completion of the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture with Pfizer. Adjusted operating profit was \u00a38,806 million, 1% lower than 2020 at AER, but 9% higher at CER on a turnover increase of 5% CER. The Adjusted operating margin of 25.8% was 0.3 percentage points lower at AER, 0.9 percentage points higher on a CER basis than in 2020. The increase in Adjusted operating profit primarily reflected the benefit from incremental pandemic sales, sales growth in Pharmaceuticals and tight control of ongoing costs, favourable legal settlements and benefits from continued restructuring a cross the business. This was offset by lower sales in Vaccines, higher supply chain costs in Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare, divestments in Consumer Healthcare and increased investment in R&D across Vaccines and Pharmaceuticals . Earnings per share Total EPS was 87.6p, compared with 115.5p in 2020. This primarily reflected an unfavourable comparison as 20 20 benefited from the net profit on disposal of Horlicks and related transactions , partly offset by a credit of \u00a3 397 million to Taxation in 2021 resulti ng from the revaluation of deferred tax assets, lower major restructuring costs and lower re-measurement charges on the contingent consideration liabilities. Adjusted EPS was 113.2 p compared with 115.9p in 2020, down 2% AER but up 9% CER, on a 9% CER incre ase in Adjusted operating profit primarily reflecting incremental pandemic sales, sales increases in Pharmaceuticals, tight cost control and favourable legal settlements and lower interest costs, partly offset by lower sales in Vaccines, higher supply chai n costs in Vaccines, increased R&D investment and a higher effective tax rate . Cash flow The net cash inflow from operating activities for the year was \u00a37,952 million (2020: \u00a38,441 million). The decrease primarily reflected adverse exchange impacts, increased trade receivables, adverse timing of returns and rebates (RAR) and increased separati on costs, partly offset by improved adjusted operating profit at CER and reduced tax payments including tax on disposals. Press release Q4 Results summary Total and Adjusted results Full year performance Quarterly performance Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 9 February 2022 , London, U.K . 20 25 Vaccines 1,809 (10) (7) Consumer Healthcare 2,497 6 10 Group turnover 9,527 9 13 Group turnover was \u00a39,527 million in the quarter, up 9% AER, 13% CER. Sales of COVID -19 solutions contributed approximately 11 percentage points to total growth in the quarter . Pharmaceutical turnover in the quarter was \u00a35,221 million, up 20% AER, 25% CER . The increase was driven by strong growth in New and Specialty products, partly offset by a decrease in the Established Products portfolio. Sales of Xevudy of \u00a3828 million contributed approximately 20 percentage points to Pharmaceuticals growth in the qua rter. Vaccines turnover dec reased 10% AER, 7% CER to \u00a31,809 million. This was primarily driven by lower Meningitis vaccines sales associated with the return to a normal US back -to-school season, lower DTPa -containing vaccines sales due to unfavourable CDC purchasing patterns in the US and lower Shingrix sales resulting from the negative impact of COVID -19 vaccination programme deployment and disease circulation, partly offset by pandemic adjuvant sales. Consumer Healthcare turnover in the quarter was \u00a32,497 million, up 6% AER, 10% CER. Sales excluding brands divested/under review increased 7% AER, 11% CER with strong growth across the whole portfolio but particularly Respiratory health which rebounded f rom the historically low cold and flu season in both Q4 2020 and Q1 2021. Operating profit Total operating profit was \u00a3 895 million in Q4 2021 compared with \u00a31,061 million in Q4 2020. This reflected higher re -measurement charges on the contingent consideration liabilities including the impact of the Gilead settlement partly offset by lower restructuring and higher profit on di sposal of assets . Adjusted operating profit was \u00a31,893 million, 4% higher than Q4 2020 at AER, 15% higher at CER on a turnover increase of 13% CER. The Adjusted operating margin of 19.9% was 0.9 percentage points lower at AER, and 0.2 percentage points hi gher on a CER basis than in Q4 2020. The increase in Adjusted operating profit primarily reflected leverage from \u00a3920 million of pandemic sales as well as strong growth in New and Specialty Products and a favourable prior period RAR adjustment in Pharmaceu ticals, continued tight control of ongoing costs and benefits from continued restructuring across the business. This was partly offset by increased investment in R&D, increased investment behind launches and higher supply chain costs resulting from lower d emand and higher inventory adjustments in Vaccines. Earnings per share Total EPS was 15.0p, compared with 13.6p in Q4 2020. This primarily reflected lower restructuring and higher disposal income partly offset by higher re -measurement charges. Adjusted E PS was 25.6p compared with 23.3p in Q4 2020, up 9% AER and 22% CER, on a 15% CER increase in Adjusted operating profit reflecting positive leverage from Xevudy sales in the quarter and lower interest costs partly offset by a higher non-controlling interes t allocation of Consumer Healthcare profits. Cash flow The net cash inflow from operating activities for the quarter was \u00a33,767 million (Q4 2020: \u00a33,855 million). The reduction primarily reflected adverse exchange impacts and a lower seasonal reduction i n trade receivables in the quarter and phasing of tax payments partly offset by improved adjusted operating profit at CER and favourable timing of RAR .

We also remain open to opport unities outside these core therapy areas where there are scale opportunities consistent with the science of the immune system and human genetic validation. As disclosed at the Investor Update on 23 June 2021, the company has a robust late -stage R&D pipel ine with many assets having the potential to be first -in-class or best -in-class, as well as offering significant strategic lifecycle opportunities. The late -stage pipeline will help deliver the sales ambition set by the company for 2021 -2026 and beyond. Our R&D pipeline currently comprises 64 Vaccines and Specialty Medicines.

GSK also uses a number of adjusted, non -IFRS, measures to report the performance of its business. Adjusted results and other non -IFRS measures may be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information presented in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted results are defined below and other non-IFRS measures are defined on page 61. GSK believes that Adjusted results, when considered together with Total results, provide investors, analysts and other stakeholders with helpful complementary information to understand better the financial performance and position of the Group from peri od to period, and allow the Group's performance to be more easily compared against the majority of its peer companies. These measures are also used by management for planning and reporting purposes. They may not be directly comparable with similarly descri bed measures used by other companies. GSK encourages investors and analysts not to rely on any single financial measure but to review GSK's quarterly results announcements, including the financial statements and notes, in their entirety. GSK is committed to continuously improving its financial reporting, in line with evolving regulatory requirements and best practice. In line with this practice, GSK expects to continue to review and refine its reporting framework. Adjusted results exclude the following i tems from Total results, together with the tax effects of all of these items: amortisation of intangible assets (excluding computer software ) impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software) and goodwill Major restructuring costs, which include impairments of tangible assets and computer software, (under specific Board approved programmes that are structural, of a significant scale and where the costs of individual or related projects exceed \u00a325 million), includ ing integration costs following material acquisitions transaction -related accounting or other adjustments related to significant acquisitions proceeds and costs of disposal of associates, products and businesses; significant settlement income; significant legal charges (net of insurance recoveries) and expenses on the settlement of litigation and government investigations; other operating income other than royalty income, and other items including the one -off impac t of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities following enactment of the increase in the headline rate of UK corporation tax from 19% to 25% (effective 2023) separation costs include costs to establish Consumer Healthcare as an independent business, as well as admission listing and demerger costs Costs for all other ordinary course smaller scale restructuring and legal charges and expenses are retained within both Total and Adjusted results. As Adjusted results include the benefits of M ajor restructuring programmes but exclude significant costs (such as significant legal, major restructuring and transaction items) they should not be regarded as a complete picture of the Group's financial performance, which is presented in Total results. The exclusion of other Adjusting items may result in Adjusted earnings being materially higher or lower than Total earnings. In particular, when significant impairments, restructuring charges and legal costs are excluded, Adjusted earnings will be higher than Total earnings. GSK has undertaken a number of Major restructuring programmes in response to significant changes in the Group's trading environment or overall strategy, or following material acquisitions. Costs, both cash and non-cash, of these programmes are provided for as individual elements are approved and meet the accounting recognition criteria. As a result, charges may be incurred over a number of years following the initiation of a Major restructuring programme. Press release Q4 Results summary Total and Adjusted results Full year performance Quarterly performance Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 9 February 2022 , London, U.K . 11 Significant leg al charges and expenses are those arising from the settlement of litigation or government investigations that are not in the normal course and materially larger than more regularly occurring individual matters. They also include certain major legacy matter s. The enactment of the increase in the headline rate of UK corporation tax from 19% to 25% (effective 2023) resulted in a credit to the income statement of \u00a3325 million in Q 2 2021 revised upwards to \u00a3 397 million in Q4 2021. Due to the magnitude, GSK has reported this credit as an Adjusting item in the year so that it does not obscure the key trends in the Group's performance for the period. Reconciliations between Total and Adjusted results, providing further information on the key Adjusting items, are set out on pages 23, 24, 38 and 39. GSK provides earnings guidance to the investor community on the basis of Adjusted results. This is in line with peer companies and expectations of the investor community, supporting easier comparison of the Group's performance with its peers. GSK is not able to give guidance for Total results as it cannot reliably forecast certain material elements of the Total results, particularly the future fair value movements on contingent consideration and put options th at can and have given rise to significant adjustments driven by external factors such as currency and other movements in capital markets. ViiV Healthcare ViiV Healthcare is a subsidiary of the Group and 100% of its operating results (turnover, operating profit, profit after tax) are included within the Group income statement. Earnings are allocated to the three shareholders of ViiV Healthcare on the basis of their respective equity shareholdings (GSK 78.3%, Pfizer 11.7% and Shionogi 10%) and their enti tlement to preferential dividends, which are determined by the performance of certain products that each shareholder contributed. As the relative performance of these products changes over time, the proportion of the overall earnings allocated to each shar eholder also changes. In particular, the increasing proportion of sales of dolutegravir and cabotegravir -containing products has a favourable impact on the proportion of the preferential dividends that is allocated to GSK. Adjusting items are allocated to shareholders based on their equity interests. GSK was entitled to approximately 86% of the Total earnings and 83% of the Adjusted earnings of ViiV Healthcare for 2021. As consideration for the acquisition of Shionogi's interest in the former Shionogi -ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012, Shionogi received the 10% equity stake in ViiV Healthcare and ViiV Healthcare also agreed to pay additional future cash consideration to Shionogi, contingent on the future sales performance of the products being develope d by that joint venture, dolutegravir and cabotegravir . Under IFRS 3 'Business combinations', GSK was required to provide for the estimated fair value of this contingent consideration at the time of acquisition and is required to update the liability to the latest estimate of fair value at each subsequent period end. The liability for the contingent consideration recognised in the balance sheet at the date of acquisition was \u00a3659 million. Subsequent re -measurements are reflected within other operating income/(expense) and within Adjusting items in the income statement in each period. On 1 February 2022, ViiV Healthcare reached agreement with Gilead to settle the global patent infringement litigation relating to the commercialisation of G ilead's Biktarvy. Under the terms of the global settlement and licensing agreement, Gilead will make an upfront payment of $1.25 billion to ViiV Healthcare which is expected in the first quarter of 2022. In addition, Gilead will also pay a 3% royalty on all future US sales of Biktarvy and in respect of the bictegravir component of any other future bictegravir -containing products sold in the US. These royalties will be payable by Gilead to ViiV Healthcare from 1 February 2022 until the expiry of ViiV Healthcare's US Patent No. 8,129,385 on 5 October 2027. Gilead's obligation to pay royalties does not extend into any period of regulatory paediatric exclusivity, if awarded . The settlement resulted in a re -measurement of the existing liabilities for contingent consideration and the Pfizer put option at the 2021 year end. The upfront payment is a contingent asset at the balance sheet date. Press release Q4 Results summary Total and Adjusted results Full year performance Quarterly performance Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 9 February 2022 , London, U.K . 12 The impact on the contingent consideration liability (CCL) is to increase it by \u00a32 88 million, on a post -tax basis in Q4 2021 due to the obligation ViiV Healthcare has to pay future cash consideration to Shionogi for its share of the upfront and of the future US sales performance of Biktarvy and products containing bictegravir . Includin g the impact of the settlement at 31 December 2021, the liability which is discounted at 8% stood at \u00a35,559 million, on a post -tax basis. Pfizer has the right to require GSK to acquire its shareholding in ViiV Healthcare in certain circumstances * at any time. A put option liability is therefore recorded on the Group's balance sheet as a current liability. It is measured on the gross redemption basis derived from an internal valuation of the ViiV Healthcare business. The impact of the settlement on the Pfizer put option liability is an increase of \u00a3114 million and is included in the re -measurement at 31 December 2021. See page 59 for an explanation of the post balance sheet event impact. Cash payments to settle the contingent consideration are made to Shionogi by ViiV Healthcare each quarter, based on the actual sales performance and other income of the relevant products in the previous quarter. These payments reduce the balance sheet liability and hence are not recorded in the income statement. The cash payments made to Shionogi by ViiV Healthcare in 2021 were \u00a3826 million. As the liability is required to be recorded at the fair value of estimated future payments, there is a significant timing difference between the charges that are recorded in the Total income statement to reflect movements in the fair value of the liability a nd the actual cash payments made to settle the liability. Further explanation of the acquisition -related arrangements with ViiV Healthcare are set out on pages 52 and 53 of the Annual Report 2020 . * See page 53 of GSK's Annual Report 2020.

Continued strong performance of Trelegy , Nucala , Benlysta and Dovato also drove growth of New and Specialty products in the Region. Established Products were stable at AER but grew 6% CER, reflecting strong demand for Established Respiratory products in the COVID -19 envir onment and certain supply challenges faced by generic competitor products, plus the benefit of favourable prior period RAR adjustments. In Europe, sales dec reased 4% AER , 2% CER, with dec reases in the Established Pharmaceuticals portfolio, impacted by gen eric competition including Seretide, Duodart and Volibris , lower antibiotic demand, and the divestment of cephalosporin products at the start of the fourth quarter. The dec rease was partly offset by strong growth of Trelegy, Benlysta and Oncology products, and of Dovato which more than doubled in the year. Sales of Xevudy totalling \u00a369 million also contributed approximately 2 percentage points to total growth. International sales decreased 3% AER but grew 4% CER. Dec reases in Established Pharmaceuticals reflected the impact of COVID -19 suppressed antibiotics markets and increased generic competition in the first half of the year.

Unfavourable US prior period RAR adjustments reduced overall Vaccines growth by approximately 2 percentage points , particularly in Fluarix/Flulaval and Shingrix where the impact on product growth was a dec rease of 7% and a dec rease of 2% respectively. Vaccines turnover excluding pandemic vaccines dec reased 9% AER, 5% CER to \u00a36,33 dec reased 7% AER, 2% CER to \u00a3961 million driven primarily by unrepeated International tender volumes for other Meningitis vaccines.

Menveo sales were up 3% AER, 9% CER to \u00a3272 million, primarily driven by 2020 cohort catch -up vaccinations and 2021 higher demand, as well as increased market share in the US. Influenza Fluarix/FluLaval sales dec reased 7% AER, 2% CER, to \u00a36 79 million as a result of unfavo urable prior period RAR movements in the US, partially offset by higher volume in the US and strong southern hemisphere demand in International . Shingles Shingrix decreased 13% AER, 9% CER to \u00a31,721 million, primarily driven by lower demand in the US and International for routine adult vaccination due to COVID -19 vaccination program me deployment and disease circulation.

On a two -year CAGR sales excluding brands divested under review grew 4% overall despite the adverse impact of the COVID -19 pandemic. Sales excluding brands divested/under review dec reased 1% AER but increased 4% CER reflecting the underlying strength of brands across the portfolio and categories and continuing growth in e -commerce. Overall, sales benefited from strong growth across all catego ries excluding Respiratory health which was negatively impacted in Q1 2021 by the historically low cold and flu season. The dec rease in cold and flu sales resulted in an approximately 1% drag on full year growth .

In Q4 2021 , cold and flu sales rebounded strongly and were above 2019 levels in Europ e and slightly below 2019 levels in the US. For the full year, cold and flu products were down mid -single digits as the H2 2021 rebound was insufficient to offset the considerable dec rease in the first quarter of 2021 which resulted from historically low d emand for cold and flu products, effectively halving the global market in the period.

Press release Q4 Results summary Total and Adjusted results Full year performance Quarterly performance Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 9 February 2022 , London, U.K . 20 Operating performance Cost of sales Total cost of sales as a percentage of turnover was 34.0%, 0.3 percentage points lower at AER and 1.1 percentage points lower in CER terms compared with 2020. This primarily reflected lower write -downs in a number of manufacturing sites and the unwind in 2020 of the fair market value uplift on inventory arising on completion of the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture with Pfizer. Excluding these and other Adjusting items, Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of turnov er was 31.4%, 1.6 percentage points higher at AER and 0.8 percentage points higher at CER compared with 2020. This primarily reflected higher pandemic sales ( Xevudy ) as well as higher supply chain costs in Vaccines resulting from lower demand and higher i nventory adjustments and higher commodity and freight costs in Consumer Healthcare, partly offset by price benefits in Pharmaceuticals, including the benefit from prior period RAR adjustments, a further contribution from restructuring savings across all th ree businesses and favourable mix in Vaccines. Selling, general and administration Total SG&A costs as a percentage of turnover were 32.2%, 1.4 percentage points lower at AER and 1.8 percentage points lower at CER compared with 2020. This included incre ased separation costs partly offset by lower restructuring charges. Excluding Adjusting items, Adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of turnover were 30.0%, 1.5 percentage points lower at AER than in 2020 and 1.8 percentage points lower on a CER basis. Adju sted SG&A costs decreased 5% AER, 1% CER which reflected the tight control of ongoing costs and reduced variable spending across all three businesses as a result of the COVID -19 lockdowns, and the continuing benefit of restructuring in Pharmaceuticals, Con sumer Healthcare and support functions. The dec rease also reflected a favourable legal settlement in 2021 compared to increased legal costs in 2020 as well as one -off benefits in pensions and insurance which were partly offset by the one -off benefit from r estructuring of post -retirement benefits in 2020. This was partly offset by increased investment behind launches in HIV and Vaccines. Research and development Total R&D expenditure was \u00a35,278 million (15.5% of turnover), up 4% AER, 7% CER, including an increase in impairments partly offset by a decrease in major restructuring charges. Adjusted R&D expenditure was \u00a34,776 million (14.0% of turnover), 4% higher at AER, 8% higher at CER than in 2020. Pharmaceuticals R&D expenditure was \u00a33,578 million (20.2 % of turnover ), stable at AER, up 4% CER, primarily driven by increased investment in our Specialty portfolios, including the early stage research projects. Efficiency savings continued from the implementation of the One R&D programme for Pharma ceuticals and Vaccines as part of the Separation prep aration restructuring programme. The growth of the Specialty portfolio in 2021 was primarily driven by our two program mes for COVID -19 treatment ( Xevudy and otilimab) a long with the other otilimab me for rheumatoid arthritis, bepirovirsen, our HBV antisense oligonucleotide and depemokimab, our anti -IL5 for asthma. This has been partly offset by reduced spend on daprodustat due to the completion of programmes. In Oncology , there is continued investment reflecting our commitment to synthetic lethalit y and in Blenrep , together with bintrafusp al fa, where we have accelerated close -out costs for the program me but this has been largely offset by a reduction in spend on feladilimab following the decision to terminate the program me in April. R&D expenditure in Vaccines was \u00a3887 million (13.1% of turnover ), up 2 9% AER, 3 4% CER, reflecting increased investment in clinical programmes for meningitis and RSV and investment in our mRNA platform, partly offset by efficiency savings from the implementatio n of the One Development programme and variable spending as a result of COVID -19 lockdowns. R&D expenditure in Consumer Healthcare was \u00a3249 million. Royalty income Royalty income was \u00a3419 million (2020: \u00a3318 million), up 3 2% AER, 32% CER, primarily driven by higher sales of Gardasil.

This included a re -measurement charge of \u00a3 1,026 million (2020: \u00a31,114 million) for the contingent consideration liability due to Shionogi, as a result of the unwinding of the discount for \u00a3380 million and a charge for \u00a3 646 million p rimarily from adjustments to sales forecasts and the settlement with Gilead (see page 11) . This was partly offset by a number of asset disposals including the disposal o f royalty rights on cabozantinib, the disposal of the cephal osporin business and disposal of a number of Consumer Healthcare brands and fair value uplifts on investments. 2020 included the net profit on disposal of Horlicks and other Consumer Healthcare brands of \u00a32,815 million, partly offset by the related loss on sale of the shares in Hindustan Unilever of \u00a3476 million. Operating profit Total operating profit was \u00a3 6,201 million compared with \u00a37,783 million in 2020. This primarily reflected an unfavourable comparison to the net profit on disposal in Q2 2020 of Ho rlicks and other Consumer brands and resultant sale of shares in Hindustan Unilever. This was partly offset by lower major restructuring costs, lower re-measurement charges on the contingent consideration liabilities and the unwind in 2020 of the fair mark et value uplift on inventory arising on completion of the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture with Pfizer. Excluding these and other Adjusting items , Adjusted operating profit was \u00a3 8,806 million, 1% lower than 2020 at AER, but 9% higher at CER on a turnover increase of 5% CER. The Adjusted operating margin of 25.8% was 0.3 percentage points lower at AER, 0.9 percentage points higher on a CER basis than in 2020. The increase in Adjusted operating profit primarily reflected the be nefit from incremental pandemic sales (Xevudy and adjuvant) contributing approximately 6% AER, 7% CER to Adjusted Operating profit growth . Adjusted Operating profit also benefited from sales growth in Pharmaceuticals including the benefit from prior period RAR adjustment s and tight control of ongoing costs including reduced promotional and variable spending across all three businesses as a result of the COVID -19 lockdowns, favourable legal settlements compared to increased legal costs in 2020 and bene fits from continued restructuring across the business. This was partly offset by lower sales in Vaccines, primarily Shingrix , higher supply chain costs in Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare , divestments in Consumer Healthcare and increased investment in R& D across Vaccines and Pharmaceuticals. Contingent consideration cash payments which are made to Shionogi and other companies reduce the balance sheet liability and hence are not recorded in the income statement. Total contingent consideration cash payment s in 2021 amounted to \u00a3856 million (2020: \u00a3885 million). This included cash payments made to Shionogi of \u00a3826 million (2020: \u00a3858 million). Adjusted operating profit by business Pharmaceuticals operating profit was \u00a3 4,681 million, up 12% AER, 24% CER on a turnover increase of 10% CER. The operating margin of 26.4% was 1.9 percentage points higher at AER than in 2020 and 3.3 percentage points higher on a CER basis. This primarily reflected price benefits in Pharmaceuticals, including the benefit from a prior period RAR adjustment, reduced supply chain costs, the tight control of ongoing costs, short term benefits to changes in ways of working , a favourable legal settlement in 2021 compared to increased legal costs in 2020 and the continuing benef it of restructuring. This was partly offset by support to launches in HIV and increased investment in R&D. Vaccines operating profit was \u00a3 2,256 million, down 17% AER, 11% CER on 2% turnover increase at CER. The operating margin of 33.3% was 5.6 percenta ge points lower at AER than in 2020 and 4.8 percentage points lower on a CER basis. This was primarily driven by higher supply chain costs resulting from higher inventory adjustments and lower demand, along with higher R&D spend to support key strategic pr iorities and increased SG&A investment to support business growth, partly offset by higher royalty income and pandemic adjuvant beneficial mix. Consumer Healthcare operating profit was \u00a3 2,239 million, up 1% AER, 9% CER on stable turnover at CER. The oper ating margin of 23.3% was 1.2 percentage points higher at AER and 2.0 percentage points higher on a CER basis than in 2020. This primarily reflected sales growth of continuing brands , price increases and favourable mix, synergy delivery from the Pfizer Jo int Venture Integration and tight cost control, partially offset by the impact of divestments (1.2 percentage points), increased advertising and promotion investment, increased commodity and freight costs and investment in manufacturing sites. Press release Q4 Results summary Total and Adjusted results Full year performance Quarterly performance Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 9 February 2022 , London, U.K . 22 Net finance costs Total net finance costs were \u00a3756 million compared with \u00a3848 million in 2020. Adjusted n et finance costs were \u00a3753 million compared with \u00a3844 million in 2020. The decrease is primarily as a result of reduced interest expense from lower debt l evels, favourable movements in foreign exchange rates, a premium paid on the early repayment and refinancing of bond debt in 2020 and reduced interest on tax partly offset by lower interest income on overseas cash post -closing of the divestment of Horlicks and other Consumer Healthcare nutrition products in India and a number of other countries . Share of after tax profits of associates and joint ventures The share of after tax profits of associates and joint ventures was \u00a333 million (2020: \u00a333 million). Loss on disposal of interests in associates The net loss on disposal of interests in associates was \u00a336 million, primarily driven by a loss on disposal of our interest in the associate Innoviva Inc. Taxation The charge of \u00a3 346 million represented an effective tax rate on Total results of 6.4% (20 20: 8.3%) and reflected the different tax effects of the various Adjusting items, including a credit of \u00a3 397 million resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets following enactment of an increase in the headline rate of UK corporation tax (effect ive 1 April 2023). 2020 reflected the disposal of Horlicks and other Consumer brands and the subsequent disposal of shares received in Hindustan Unilever. Tax on Adjusted profit amounted to \u00a3 1,415 million and represented an effective Adjusted tax rate of 17.5% (2020: 16.0%). Issues related to taxation are described in Note 14, 'Taxation' in the Annual Report 2020. The Group continues to believe it has made adequate provision for the liabilities lik ely to arise from periods which are open and not yet agreed by tax authorities. The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant tax authorities. Non-controlling inter ests The allocation of Total earnings to non -controlling interests amounted to \u00a3 711 million (2020: \u00a3639 million). The increase was primarily due to an increased allocation of Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture profits of \u00a3461 million (2020: \u00a3374 million) a nd an increased allocation of ViiV Healthcare profits of \u00a3 197 million (2020: \u00a3223 million), including reduced credits for re -measurement of contingent consideration liabilities. The allocation of Adjusted earnings to non -controlling interests amounted to \u00a31,006 million (2020: \u00a31,031 million). The reduction in allocation primarily reflected a reduced allocation of ViiV Healthcare profits of \u00a3438 million (2020: \u00a3474 million), partly offset by higher net profits in some of the Group's other entities with non-controlling interests. The allocation of Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture profits was \u00a3515 million (2020: \u00a3515 million). Earnings per share Total EPS was 87.6p compared with 115.5p in 2020. This primarily reflected an unfavourable comparison to the n et profit on disposal in Q2 2020 of Horlicks and other Consumer brands partly offset by the related loss on sale of the shares in Hindustan Unilever, partly offset by a credit of \u00a3 397 million to Taxation in 202 1 resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets following enactment of an increase in the headline rate of UK corporation tax (effective 1 April 2023), lower major restructuring costs and lower re -measurement charges on the contingent consideration liabilities. Adjusted EPS was 113.2p compared with 115.9p in 2020, down 2% AER but up 9% CER, on a 9% CER increase in Adjusted operating profit primarily reflecting incremental pandemic sales, sales increases in Pharmaceuticals, tight cost control and favourable legal settlements and lower interest costs, partly offset by lower sales in Vaccines, primarily Shingrix , higher supply chain costs in Vaccines, increased R&D investment and a higher effective tax rate . The contribution to growth from COVID -19 solutions was approximately 8% AER, 9% CER. Currency impact on 2021 results The results for 2021 are based on average exchange rates, principally \u00a31/$1.38 , \u00a31/\u20ac1.16 and \u00a31/Yen 151. Comparative exchange rates are given on page 57. The period -end exchange rates were \u00a31/$1.35, \u00a31/ \u20ac1.19 and \u00a31/Ye n 155. In 2021, turnover remained stable at AER, but was up 5% CER. Total EPS was 87.6p compared with 115.5p in 2020. Adjusted EPS was 113.2 p compared with 115.9p in 2020, down 2% AER but up 9% CER. The adverse currency impact primarily reflected the strengthening in Sterling, particularly against the US Dollar as well as the Japanese Yen and Euro. Exchange gains or losses on the settlement of intercompany transactions had a negligible impact on the negative currency impact of eleven percentage points on Adjusted EPS.

Total Major restructuring charges incurred in 2021 were \u00a3 626 million (20 20: major restructuring programme (incl. Tesaro) 18 9 27 105 210 315 Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture integration programme 173 11 184 298 28 326 Separation Preparation restructuring programme 371 59 430 625 216 841 Combined restructuring and integration programme 8 (23) (15) 39 11 50 570 56 626 1,067 465 1,532 Cash charges of \u00a3371 million under the Separation Preparation programme primarily arose from restructuring of some administrative and central manufacturing functions as well as commercial pharmaceuticals and R&D functions. The non -cash charges of \u00a35 9 million primarily reflected write -down of assets in administrative locations and R&D sites. Cash charges of \u00a3173 milli on on the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture programme primarily related to severance and integration costs. The non -cash credit in the Combined restructuring and integration programme primarily reflected a write back on disposal of a site. Total cash paym ents made in 2021 \u00a3434 million (2020: \u00a3152 million) relating to the Separation Preparation restructuring programme, a further \u00a317 6 million (2020: \u00a3291 million) relating to the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture integr ation programme, \u00a395 million (2020: \u00a3179 million) under the 2018 major restructuring programme including the settlement of certain charges accrued in previous quarters and \u00a348 million (2020: \u00a3115 million) for the existing Combined restructuring integra tion programme. 2021 \u00a3m 2020 \u00a3m Pharmaceuticals 233 671 Vaccines (40) 214 Consumer Healthcare 196 374 389 1,259 Corporate & central functions 237 273 Total Major restructuring costs 626 1,532 Press release Q4 Results summary Total and Adjusted results Full year performance Quarterly performance Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 9 February 2022 , London, U.K . 26 The analysis of Major restructuring charges by Income statement line was as follows : 2021 \u00a3m 2020 \u00a3m Cost of sales 154 667 Selling, general and administration 426 659 Research and development 46 206 Other operating income/(expense) - - Total Major restructuring costs 626 1,532 The benefit in the year from restructuring programmes was \u00a30. 7 billion, the benefit from the Separation Preparation restructuring programme was \u00a30.3 billion, the benefit from the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture integration was \u00a30.2 billion and the benefit from the 2018 Restructuring programme was \u00a30. 2 billion. The 2018 major restructuring programme, including Tesaro, has cost \u00a31.5 billion to the end of 2021, with cash costs of \u00a30.6 billion and non -cash costs of \u00a30.9 billion, and has delivered annual savings of around \u00a30.5 billion by the end of 2021 (at 2019 rates). These savings were fully re -invested to help fund targeted increases in R&D and commercial support of new products . The programme is substantially complete and therefore GSK will cease external reporting of total costs and benefits of the 2018 major rest ructuring programme from 2022 onwards. The completion of the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture with Pfizer has realised substantial cost synergies and has largely delivered the expected total annual cost savings of \u00a30.5 billion by 2021. The cash costs are expected to be \u00a30.7 billion and non -cash charges expected to be \u00a30.1 billion, plus additional capital expenditure of \u00a30.2 billion. Up to 25% of the cost savings are intended to be reinvested in the business to support innovation and other growth opportunities. The Group initiated in Q1 2020 a two -year Separation Preparation programme to prepare for the separation of GSK into two companies: new GSK, a biopharma company with an R&D approach focused on science related to the immune system, the use o f genetics and new technologies, and a new leader in Consumer Healthcare. The programme aims to: Drive a common approach to R&D with improved capital allocation Align and improve the capabilities and efficiency of global support functions to support new GSK Further optimise the supply chain and product portfolio, including the divestment of non -core assets. A strategic review of prescription dermatology is underway Prepare Consumer Healthcare to operate as a standalone company The programme continues to target delivery of \u00a30. 8 billion of annual savings by 2022 and \u00a3 1.0 billion by 2023, with total costs estimated at \u00a32.4 billion, of which \u00a31.6 billion is expected to be cash costs. The proceeds of divestments have largely covered the cash costs of the programme. Press release Q4 Results summary Total and Adjusted results Full year performance Quarterly performance Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 9 February 2022 , London, U.K . 27 Transaction -related adjustments Transaction -related adjustments resulted in a net charge of \u00a3 1,159 million (2020: \u00a31,308 million). This included a net \u00a3 1,101 million accounting charge for the re -measurement of the contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisitions of the former Shionogi -ViiV Healthcare joint venture and the former Novartis Vaccines business and the liabilities for the Pfizer put option and Pfizer and Shionogi preferential dividends in ViiV Healthcare. Charge/(credit) 2021 \u00a3m 2020 \u00a3m Contingent consideration on former Shionogi joint venture (including Shionogi preferential dividends) 1,026 1,114 ViiV Healthcare put options and Pfizer preferential dividends 48 (52) Contingent consideration on former Novartis Vaccines business 27 172 Release of fair value uplift on acquired Pfizer inventory - 91 Other adjustments 58 (17) Total transaction -related charges 1,159 1,308 The \u00a3 1,026 million charge relating to the contingent consideration for the former Shionogi -ViiV Healthcare joint venture represented an increase in the valuation of the contingent consideration due to Shionogi, as a result of the unwind of the discount for \u00a3380 million and a charge of \u00a3 646 million primarily from adjustments to sales forecasts and the settlement with Gilead as well as updated exchange rate assumptions. The \u00a3 48 million charge relating to the ViiV Healthcare put option and Pfiz er preferential dividends represented a n increase in the valuation of the put option as a result of the settlement with Gilead, offset by lower cash and updated exchange rate assumptions. The ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability is fair valu ed under IFRS. The potential impact of the COVID -19 pandemic remains uncertain and at 31 December 2021, it has been assumed that there will be no significant impact on the long -term value of the liability. This position remains under review and the amount of the liability will be updated in future quarters as further information on the impact of the pandemic becomes available. An explanation of the accounting for the non -controlling interests in ViiV Healthcare is set out on page 11. Divestments, significant legal charges and other items Divestments and other items also included gains from a number of asset disposals, including the disposal of royalty rights on cabozantinib, disposal of the cephalosporins business and disposal of a number of Consum er Healthcare brands, fair value gains on investments and certain other Adjusting items , including the impact of the enactment of the increase in the headline rate of UK Corporate tax as discussed on page 11 . The Consumer Healthcare b rands disposal program me is complete and has delivered net proceeds of \u00a31.1 billion. In 2021 the net loss on disposal of interests in associates was \u00a3 36 million, primarily driven by a loss on disposal of the interest in the associate Innoviva Inc. A charge of \u00a326 million (2020: \u00a37 million) was recorded for significant legal matters arising in the period. Significant legal cash payments were \u00a3 5 million (2020: \u00a39 million). Included within Divestments, significant legal and other items , is a deferred tax credit of \u00a3157 million arising on the transfer of intellectual property within the group during the quarter. This deferred tax credit arises due to differences between group value and the market value of the assets transferred . Separation costs From Q2 2020, the Group started to report additional costs to prepare for establishment of the Consumer Healthcare business as an independent entity (\"Separation costs\"). Total Separation costs incurred in 2021 were \u00a3314 million (2020: \u00a368 million). This includes \u00a338 million relating to transaction costs including preparatory admission costs (costs relating to achieve a listing). Total separation costs are estimated to be \u00a3600 -700 million, excluding transaction costs.

Pandemic Sales Sales of Xevudy were \u00a3828 million in the quarter, up from \u00a3114 million in the third quarter. This reflected the ongoing fulfilment of contracts across the world and most significantly the US, which reported sales of \u00a3586 million. Established Pharmaceuticals Sales of Established Pharmaceuticals in the quarter were \u00a31,968 million, down 6% AER, 2% CER. Established Respiratory products dec reased 2% AER but grew 2% CER to \u00a31,075 million, including the benefit of a prior period adjustment in the quarter. This product category continues to experience generic competition to products including Advair/Seretide and Ventolin , but with some flattening o f the generic decline including Xyzal in Japan. The remainder of the Established Pharmaceuticals portfolio dec reased by 11% AER, 6% CER to \u00a3893 million with ongoing generic impacts on products including Volibris in Europe and Lamictal in the US, and approximately 2 percentage points impact from the divestment of GSK's cephalosporin products at the start of the quarter.

Vaccines turnover excluding pandemic vaccines dec reased 15% AER, 12% CER to \u00a31,71 7 million. Meningi tis Meningitis sales were down by 29% AER, 27% CER to \u00a3194 million. Bexsero sales dec 20% AER, 17% and dec reased 42% AER, 42% CER to \u00a348 million primarily driven by the return to a normal US back -to-school vaccination season focused in Q3 2021 compared with an elongated pattern in 2020 when COVID -19 related transition to virtual schooling spread demand into Q4 2021 . Menveo sales also reflect lower demand in International. Influenza Fluarix/Fl uLaval sales were down 3% AER, stable at CER to \u00a324 4 million as a result of higher expected US returns associated with less influenza disease circulation and vaccination resulting from COVID -19 mitigations , offset by late season sales and increased supply in Europe. Shingles Shingrix decreased 7% AER, 4% CER to \u00a3597 million driven by lower demand resulting from de -prioriti sation related to COVID -19 vaccination and containment measures in the US and International, par tially offset by demand recovery post COVID -19 mass vaccination in Germany and new launches in Europe.

Press release Q4 Results summary Total and Adjusted results Full year performance Quarterly performance Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 9 February 2022 , London, U.K . 35 Operating performance Cost of sales Total cost of sales as a percentage of turnover was 38.6%, 2.3 percentage points higher at AER and 1.8 percentage points higher in CER terms compared with Q4 2020. This included a reduction in write -downs in manufacturing sites. Excluding these and othe r Adjusting items, Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of turnover was 36.7%, 4.7 percentage points higher at AER and 4.2 percentage points higher at CER compared with Q4 2020. This primarily reflected higher pandemic sales from Xevudy in the quarter as well as higher supply chain costs resulting from lower demand and higher inventory adjustments in Vaccines, partly offset by price benefits in Pharmaceuticals, including the benefit from a prior period RAR adjustment. Selling, general a nd administration Total SG&A costs as a percentage of turnover were 34.2%, 2.0 percentage points lower at AER and 2.5 percentage points lower CER compared with Q4 2020. This included an increase in separation costs and significant legal costs. Excluding Adjusting items, Adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of turnover were 30.5%, 2.9 percentage points lower at AER than in Q4 2020 and 3.4 percentage points lower on a CER basis. Adjusted SG&A costs decreased 1% AER but increased 2% CER which reflected incr eased investment for launches in Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines partly offset by reduced costs for legal settlements, one-off benefits in pensions and insurance continued tight control of ongoing costs and the continuing benefit of restructuring in Consumer Healthcare and support functions. Research and development Total R&D expenditure was \u00a3 1,448 million ( 15.2% of turnover), down 2% AER, and up 1% CER, including an reduction in restructuring costs . Adjusted R&D expenditure was \u00a31,365 million (14.3% of turnover), 5% higher at AER, 7% higher at CER than in Q4 2020. Pharmaceuticals R&D expenditure was \u00a31,041 million (19.9% of turnover ), stable at AER, up 2% CER, reflecting steady progression of the portfolio offset by reduction in spend in bintrafusp al fa, feladilimab and daprodustat. Efficiency savings continue from the implementation of our One R&D programme for Pharma ceuticals and Vaccines as part of the Separation preparation restructuring programme. In the Specialty portfolio , investment has been sta ble, with increased investment in the early -stage Research program mes (including IL18 and CCL17) and in depemokimab, our anti -IL5 for asthma. This has been offset by reduced spend on daprodustat due to completion of programmes. In Oncology , there has been increased investment in Blenrep , NY-ESO and cobolimab however these increases were offset by a reduction in spend on feladilimab following the decision to terminate the program me in April and bintrafusp al fa program me closure. R&D expenditure in Vaccines was \u00a3230 million (12.7% of turnover ), up 29% AER, 35% CER, reflecting increased investment in clinical programmes for meningitis , RSV and investment in our mRNA platform, partly offset by efficiency savings from the implementation of the One Devel opment programme . R&D expenditure in Consumer Healthcare was \u00a381 million. Royalty income Royalty income was \u00a3135 million (Q4 2020: \u00a391 million), up 48% AER and up 46% at CER, primarily reflecting increased royalties on sales of Gardasil. Press release Q4 Results summary Total and Adjusted results Full year performance Quarterly performance Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 9 February 2022 , London, U.K . 36 Other operating income/(expense) Net other operating expense of \u00a3 379 million (Q4 2020: \u00a334 million) primarily reflected accounting charges of \u00a3612 million (Q4 2020: \u00a32 million credit) arising from the re -measurement of the contingent consideration liabilities re lated to the acquisitions of the former Shionogi -ViiV Healthcare joint venture and the former Novartis Vaccines business and the liabilities for the Pfizer put opt ion and Pfizer and Shionogi preferential dividends in ViiV Healthcare. This included a re -measurement charge of \u00a3 528 million (Q4 2020: \u00a33 million credit) for the contingent consideration liability due to Shionogi, as a result of the unwinding of the discount for \u00a3101 million and a charge for \u00a3 427 million primarily from the settlement with Gilead a nd adjustments to sales forecasts partly offset by updated exchange rate assumptions. This was par tly offset by a number of asset disposals including the profit on disposal of the cephalosporins business. Operating profit Total operating profit was \u00a3 895 million in Q4 2021 compared with \u00a31,061 million in Q4 2020. This reflected higher re -measurement charges on the contingent consideration liabilities partly offset by lower restructuring and higher profit on disposal of assets . Excluding these and other Adjusting items , Adjusted operating profit was \u00a3 1,893 million, 4% higher than Q4 2020 at AER, 15% higher at CER on a turnover increase of 13% CER. The Adjusted operating margin of 19.9% was 0.9 percentage points lower at AER, and 0.2 percentage poin ts higher on a CER basis than in Q4 2020. The increase in Adjusted operating profit primarily reflected leverage from \u00a3920 million of pandemic sales (Xevudy \u00a3828 million, Pandemic adjuvant \u00a3 92 million) as well as strong growth in New and Specialty Produc ts and a favourable prior period RAR adjustment in Pharmaceuticals, reduced costs for legal settlements continued tight control of ongoing costs and benefits from continued restructuring across the business. This was partly offset by increased investment i n R&D, increased investment behind launches and higher supply chain costs resulting from lower demand and higher inventory adjustments in Vaccines . The contribution to growth from COVID -19 solutions was approximately 12% AER, 15% CER. Contingent consideration cash payments which are made to Shionogi and other companies reduce the balance sheet liability and hence are not recorded in the income statement. Total contingent consideration cash payments in Q4 2021 amounted to \u00a3225 million (Q4 2020: \u00a32 21 million). This included cash made to Shionogi of \u00a3211 million (Q4 2020: \u00a3210 million). Adjusted operating profit by business Pharmaceuticals operating profit was \u00a3 1,028 million, up 21% AER, 37% CER on a turnover increase of 25% CER. The opera ting margin of 19.7% was 0.2 percentage points higher at AER than in Q4 2020 and 1.9 percentage points higher on a CER basis. This primarily reflected strong growth in New and Specialty products and a favourable prior period RAR adjustment as well as cont inued tight control of ongoing costs and benefits from continued restructuring. This was partly offset by reduced costs for legal settlements and increased investment behind launches. Vaccines operating profit was \u00a3 403 million, 42% lower than Q4 2020 at AER, and 43% lower at CER on a turnover decrease of 7% CER. The operating margin of 22.3% was 12.1 percentage points lower at AER than in Q4 2020 and 13.2 percentage points lower on a CER basis. This was primarily driven by negative operating leverage from the sales dec rease, higher supply chain costs resulting from lower demand and higher inventory adjustments, higher SG&A investment behind key brands and higher R&D spend to support key strategic priorities. This was partly offset b y higher royalty income. Consumer Healthcare operating profit was \u00a3558 million, up 45% AER but up 56% CER on a turnover increase of 10% CER. The operating margin of 22.3% was 6.0 percentage point higher at AER and 6.9 percentage points higher on a CER ba sis than in Q4 2020. The margin increase at CER reflected leverage from volume growth and price increases, incremental synergy benefits from the Pfizer Joint Venture and the one -time benefit from legal settlements offset by incremental supply chain costs, including commodities and freight. Net finance costs Total net finance costs were \u00a3 187 million compared with \u00a3234 million in Q4 2020. Adjusted net finance costs were \u00a3 186 million compared with \u00a3233 million in Q4 2020. The decrease primarily reflected a pr emium paid on the early repayment and refinancing of bond debt in Q4 2020, reduced interest on tax, increased swap interest income on foreign currency hedges and favourable movements in foreign exchange rates. Press release Q4 Results summary Total and Adjusted results Full year performance Quarterly performance Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 9 February 2022 , London, U.K . 37 Share of after tax profits of associates and joint ventures The share of after tax losses of associates and joint ventures was \u00a32 million (Q4 2020: \u00a36 million). Taxation The credit of \u00a3224 million represented an effective tax rate on Total results of (31.7) % (Q4 2020: (2.2)%) and reflected the different tax effects of the various Adjusting items including a further credit adjustment of \u00a372 million resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets following enactment of the proposed change of UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% (effective 1 April 2023). Tax on Adjusted profit amounted to \u00a3177 million and represented an effective Adjusted tax rate of 10.4% (Q4 2020: 13.9%). Issues related to taxation are described in Note 14, 'Taxation' in the Annual Report 2020. The Group continues to believe it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods which are open and not yet agreed by tax authorities. The ult imate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant tax authorities. Non-controlling interests The allocation of Total earnings to non -controlling interests amounted to \u00a3 181 million (Q4 2020: \u00a3162 million). The increase was primarily due to an increased allocation of Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture profits of \u00a3180 million (Q4 2020: \u00a364 million) offset by a reduced allocation of ViiV Healthcare losses of \u00a38 million (Q4 2020: \u00a397 million profits ), including increased credits for re -measurement of contingent consideration liabilities. The allocation of Adjusted earnings to non -controlling interests amounted to \u00a3248 million (Q4 2020: \u00a3195 million). The increase in allocation primarily reflected an increased allocation of Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture profits of \u00a3 132 million (Q4 2020: \u00a391 million) and an increased allocation of ViiV Healthcare profits of \u00a3 107 million (Q4 2020: \u00a3103 million). Earnings per share Total EPS was 15.0p, compared with 13.6p in Q4 2020. This primarily reflected lower restructuring and higher disposal income partly offset by higher re -measurement charges. Adjusted EPS was 25.6p compared with 23.3p in Q4 2020, up 9% AER and 22% CER, on a 15% CER increase in Adjusted operating profit reflecting positive leverage from Xevudy sales in the quarter and lower interest costs partly offset by a higher non -controlling interest allocation of Consumer Healthcare profits. The contri bution to growth from COVID -19 solutions was approximately 17% AER, 20% CER. Currency impact on Q 4 2021 results The results for Q4 2021 are based on average exchange rates, principally \u00a31/$1.36 , \u00a31/\u20ac1.18 and \u00a31/Yen 154. Comparative exchange rates are given on page 57. The period -end exchange rates were \u00a31/$1.35, \u00a31/ \u20ac1.19 and \u00a31/Yen 155. In the quarter, turnover increased 9% AER, 13% CER. Total EPS was 15.0p compared with 13.6p in Q4 2020. Adjusted EPS was 25.6p compared with 23.3p in Q4 2020, up 9% AER and 22% CER. The adverse currency impact primarily reflected the strengthening in Sterling, particularly against the US dollar as well as Euro and Japanese Yen. Exchange gains or losses on the settlement of intercompany transactions had a one percentage point , negative currency impact of 13 percentage points on Adjusted EPS.

Non -cash charge of \u00a3 41 million primarily related to write -down of assets in administrative locations and R&D sites. Cash charges of \u00a3 67 million on the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture programme primarily related to severance and integration costs. Total cash payments made in Q4 2021 were \u00a3 181 million (Q4 \u00a3 112 million (Q4 2020: \u00a371 million) relating to the Separation Preparation restructuring programme, a further \u00a3 35 million (Q4 2020: \u00a367 million) relating to the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture integration programme, \u00a3 25 million (Q4 202 0: \u00a334 million) under the 2018 major restructuring programme including the settlement of certain charges accrued in previous quarters and \u00a3 9 million (Q4 2020: \u00a322 million) for the existing Combined restructuring and integration programme.

Transaction -related adjustments Transaction -related adjustments resulted in a net charge of \u00a3 623 million (Q4 2020: \u00a31 million). This included a net accounting charge of \u00a3612 million (Q4 2020: \u00a32 million credit) for the re -measurement of the contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisitions of the former Shionogi -ViiV Healthcare joint venture and the former Novartis Vaccines business and the liabilities for the Pfizer put option and Pfizer and Shionogi preferential dividends in ViiV Healthcare.

The \u00a3 101 million charge relating to the ViiV Healthcare put option and Pfizer preferential dividends represented an increase in the valuation of the put option following the settlement with Gilead offset by updated exchange rate assumptions. The ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability is fair valued under IFRS. The potential impact of the COVID -19 pandemic remains uncertain and at 31 December 2021, it has been assumed that there will be no significant impact on the long -term value o f the liability. This position remains under review and the amount of liability will be updated in future quarters as further information on the impact of the pandemic becomes available. An explanation of the accounting for the non -controlling interests in ViiV Healthcare is set out on page 11. Divestments, significant legal charges and other items Divestments and other items included a number of asset disposals including the profit on disposal of the cephalosporins business and certain other Adjusting ite ms. There was a charge of \u00a3 37 million (Q4 2020: \u00a31 million) for significant legal matters arising in the quarter. Significant legal cash payments were \u00a3 1 million (Q4 2020: \u00a32 million ). Included within Divestments, significant legal and other items , is a d eferred tax credit of \u00a3157 million arising on the transfer of intellectual property within the group during the quarter. This deferred tax credit arises due to differences between group value and the market value of the assets transferred . Separation cos ts From Q2 2020, the Group started to report additional costs to prepare for Consumer Healthcare separation. Separation costs incurred in the quarter were \u00a3130 million (Q4 2020: \u00a3 25 million) including preparatory admission costs of \u00a3 38 million.

The decrease primarily reflected adverse exchange impacts, increased trade receivables, adverse timing of RAR and increased separation costs, partly offset by improved adjusted operating profit at CER and reduced tax payment s including tax on disposals. Total cash payments to Shionogi in relation to the ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability in the year were \u00a3 826 million (2020: \u00a3858 million), of which \u00a3 721 million was recognised in cash flows from operating activities and \u00a3 105 million was recognised in contingent consideration paid within investing cash flows. These payments are deductible for tax purposes. Free cash inflow was \u00a3 4,437 million for the year (2020: \u00a35,406 million). The decrease primarily reflected adverse exchange impacts, increased trade receivables, adverse timing of RAR , increased purchases of intangible assets and reduced proceeds from intangible assets. This was partl y offset by improved adjusted operating profit at CER, reduced tax payments including tax on disposals and lower dividends to non-controlling interests. Q4 2021 The net cash inflow from operating activities for the quarter was \u00a33,7 67 million (Q4 2020: \u00a3 3,855 million). The reduction primarily reflected adverse exchange impacts and a lower seasonal reduction in trade receivables in the quarter and phasing of tax payments partly offset by improved adjusted operating profit at CER and favourable timing of RAR. Total cash payments to Shionogi in relation to the ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability in the quarter were \u00a3211 million (Q4 2020: \u00a3210 million), of which \u00a3184 million was recognised in cash flows from operating activities and \u00a327 millio n was recognised in contingent consideration paid within investing cash flows. These payments are deductible for tax purposes. Free cash inflow was \u00a32,9 01 million for the quarter (Q4 2020: \u00a33,106 million ). The reduction primarily reflected adverse exchang e impacts and a lower seasonal reduction in trade receivables in the quarter, phasing of tax payments and lower proceeds from intangible assets, partly offset by improved adjusted operating profit at CER , favourable timing of RAR and lower purchases of intangible assets. Net debt At 31 December 2021, net debt was \u00a3 19.8 billion, compared with \u00a320.8 billion at 31 December 2020, comprising gross debt of \u00a3 24.1 billion and cash and liquid investments of \u00a3 4.3 billion. Net debt reduce d due to \u00a34.4 billion free cash flow and \u00a30.5 billion proceeds from investments, including \u00a30.3 billion proceeds from the Innoviva disposal and \u00a3 0.3 billion of net favourable exchange impacts from the translation of non -Sterling denominated debt and exchan ge on other financing items partly offset by the dividends paid to shareholders of \u00a34.0 billion and additional investments of \u00a3 0.2 billion. At 31 December 2021, GSK had short -term borrowings (including overdrafts and lease liabilities) repayable within 12 months of \u00a3 3.6 billion with loans of \u00a3 4.0 billion repayable in the subsequent year. Press release Q4 Results summary Total and Adjusted results Full year performance Quarterly performance Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 9 February 2022 , London, U.K . 43 Returns to shareholders Quarterly dividends The Board has declared a fourth interim dividend for 2021 of 23 pence per share (Q4 2020: 23 pence per share). On 23 June 2021, at the new GSK Investor Update, GSK set out that from 2022 a progressive dividend policy will be implemented. The dividend policy, the total expected cash distribution, and the respective dividend pay-out ratios for new GSK and new Consum er Healthcare remain unchanged. GSK expects to declare a 27p per share dividend payable by the current group for the first half. This comprises 22 pence per share for new GSK and 5 pence per share representing Consumer Healthcare during the first half wh ilst part of the group. For the second half of 2022, new GSK continues to expect to declare a 22p per share dividend. As previously communicated, new GSK would expect to declare a dividend of 45 pence per share for 2023. Following separation, the dividend policy for the new Consumer Healthcare company will be the responsibility of its Board of Directors and is expected to be guided by a 30 to 50 per cent pay -out ratio. On this basis, we now expect a second -half dividend fr om the new Consumer Healthcare company equivalent to a payout of around 3 pence per share, subject to its Board's decisions on the intra -year phasing of dividend payments. This expected distribution per share for the second half of the year has been adjust ed from that highlighted at the GSK Investor Update in June 2021 to reflect the total number of shares (up to c irca 9.25 billion shares) in the new Consumer Healthcare company that are expected to be in issue upon demerger. In June 2021 the planning assu mption for the Investor Update reflected only the GSK shares in issue at that time (circa 5 billion shares). In aggregate, this would represent on the full year 2022 basis the equivalent of a Group dividend of around 52p per share. Dividends payable by Consumer Healthcare will only be receivable by shareholders who remain invested in Consumer Healthcare post -separation and at the appropriate record dates. Payment of dividends The equivalent interim dividend receivable by ADR holders will be calculated b ased on the exchange rate on 4 April 2022. An annual fee of $0.03 per ADS (or $0.00 75 per ADS per quarter ) is charged by the Deposit ary. The ex -dividend date will be 24 February 2022, with a record date of 25 February 2022 and a payment date of 7 April 2022.

GSK reports results under four segments: Pharmaceuticals; Pharmaceuticals R&D; Vaccines an d Consumer Healthcare, and individual members of the GLT are responsible for each segment. The Pharmaceuticals R&D segment is the responsibility of the Chief Scientific Officer and President, R&D and is reported as a separate segment. The operating profi t of this segment excludes the ViiV Healthcare operating profit (including R&D expenditure) that is reported within the Pharmaceuticals segment. The Group's management reporting process allocates intra -Group profit on a product sale to the market in which that sale is recorded, and the profit analyses below have been presented on that basis. Corporate and other unallocated turnover and costs include the results of certain Consumer Healthcare products which are being held for sale in a number of markets in order to meet anti -trust approval requirements, together with the costs of corporate functions .

At 31 December 2021, the Group's aggregate provision for legal and other disputes (not including tax matters described on page 22 was \u00a30.2 billion (31 December 2020: \u00a3 0.3 billion). The Group may become involved in significant legal procee dings in respect of which it is not possible to meaningfully assess whether the outcome will result in a probable outflow, or to quantify or reliably estimate the liability, if any, that could result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. In these ca ses, the Group would provide appropriate disclosures about such cases, but no provision would be made. The ultimate liability for legal claims may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations. The Group's position could change over time, and, therefore, there can be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legal proceedings will not exceed by a material amount the amount of the provis ions reported in the Group's financial accounts . Significant developments since the date of the Annual Report 2020 are as follows: ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority -owned by GSK, with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi & Co. Limited as shareholders, has agreed to settle the global patent infringement litigation between GSK, Shionogi and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) concerning ViiV Healthcare's patents relating to dolutegravir, an antiretroviral medication used, together with other medicines, to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Under the terms of the global settlement and licensing agreement, Gilead will make an upfront payment of $1.25 billion to ViiV Healthcare which is expected in the first quarter of 2022. In add ition, Gilead will also pay a 3% royalty on all future US sales of Biktarvy and in respect of the bictegravir component of any other future bictegravir -containing products sold in the US. These royalties will be payable by Gilead to ViiV Healthcare from 1 February 2022 until the expiry of ViiV Healthcare's U.S. Patent No. 8,129,385 on 5 October 2027. Gilead's obligation to pay royalties does not extend into any period of regulatory paediatric exclusivity, if awarded. As a result of the settlement, patent infringement cases in the US, UK, France, Ireland, Germany, Japan, Korea, Australia, and Canada will be discontinued.

This Results Announcement has been prepared applying consistent accounting policies to those applied by the Group in the Annual Report 2020. The Group has not identified any changes to its key sources of accounting judgements or estimations of uncertainty compared with those disclosed in the Annual Report 20 20. This Results Announcement does not constitute statutory accounts of the Group within the meaning of sections 434(3) and 435(3) of the Companies Act 2006.

COVID -19 pandemic The potential impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on GSK's trading performance and all our principal risks has been assessed with mitigation plans put in place. In 2021, as anticipated, the pandemic impacted Group performance prim arily in demand for Vaccines and reflected the prioritisation of COVID -19 vaccination programmes by governments' , including social distancing rules resulting from COVID -19 that affected customers' ability and willingness to access vaccination services acro ss all regions. We continue to remain confident in the underlying demand for our Vaccines and are encouraged by the rate at which COVID -19 vaccinations and boosters are being administered in many countries, which provides support for healthcare systems and the eventual return to normal. This continues to be a dynamic situation, with the future severity, duration and impact unknown at this point including potential impacts on trading results, clinical trials, supply continuity , and our employees. The situati on could change at any time and there can be no assurance that the COVID -19 pandemic will not have a material adverse impact on the future results of the Group . Exchange rates GSK operate s in many countries, and earns revenues and incurs costs in many currencies. The results of the Group, as reported in Sterling, are affected by movements in exchange rates between Sterling and other currencies. Average exchange rates, as modified by specific transaction rates for large transactions, prev ailing during the period , are used to translate the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures into Sterling. Period -end rates are used to translate the net assets of those entities. The currencies which most influenced these translations and the relevant exchange rates were : 2021 2020 Q4 2021 Q4 2020 Average rates: US$/\u00a3 1.36 1.33 Euro/\u00a3 1.16 1.13 1.18 1.11 Yen/\u00a3 151 137 154 138 Period -end rates: US$/\u00a3 1.35 1.36 1.35 1.36 Euro/\u00a3 1.19 1.11 1.19 1.11 Yen/\u00a3 155 141 155 141 During Q 4 2021 average Sterling exchange rates were stronger against the US Dollar, the Yen and the Euro compared with the same period in 2020. During the year ended 3 1 December 2021, average Sterling exchange rates were stronger against the US Dollar , the Yen and the Euro compared with the same period in 2020. Period -end Sterling exchange rates were stronger against the Euro and the Yen and weaker against the US Dollar compared with the 2020 period -end rates . Press release Q4 Results summary Total and Adjusted results Full year performance Quarterly performance Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 9 February 2022 , London, U.K . 58 Net assets The book value of net assets increased by \u00a3534 million from \u00a3 20,808 million at 31 December 20 20 to \u00a321,342 million at 3 1 December 2021. This primarily reflected the Total profit for the period, the re-measurement gains on the defined benefit plans , increase s in deferred tax , other non -current assets and trade receivables . These were partially offset by the decrease in fair value of equity investments, increase in trade and other payables and the dividends paid during the period. The carrying value of investments in associates and joint ventures at 31 December 2021 was \u00a3 88 million (31 December 2020: \u00a3364 million), with a market value of \u00a3 88 million (31 December 2020: \u00a3364 million). During 2021, the Group sold all of its shares in Innoviva Inc back to Innoviva for \u00a3277 million. At 31 December 2021 , the net deficit on the Group's pension plans was \u00a3 1,129 million compared with \u00a32,104 million at 31 December 2020. The decrease in the net deficit primarily relate to higher assets value, increase in the rates used to discount UK pension liabilities from 1.4% to 2.0%, and US pension liabilities from 2.3% to 2.7%, partly offset by an increase in the UK inflation rate from 2.8% to 3. 2%. The estimated present value of the potential redemption amount of the Pfizer put option related to ViiV Healthcare, recorded in Other payables in Current liabilities, was \u00a3 1,008 million (31 December 20 20: \u00a3960 million). Contingent consideration amounted to \u00a36,076 million at 3 1 December 2021 (31 December 20 20: \u00a35,869 million), of which \u00a3 5,559 million (31 December 20 20: \u00a35,359 million) represented the estimated present value o f amounts payable to Shionogi relating to ViiV Healthcare and \u00a3 479 million (31 December 20 20: \u00a3477 million) represented the estimated present value of contingent consideration payable to Novartis related to the Vaccines acquisition. Of the contingent con sideration payable (on a post -tax basis) to Shionogi at 3 1 December 2021, \u00a3937 million (31 December 20 20: \u00a3745 million) is expected to be paid within one year . Movements in contingent consideration are as follows : 2021 ViiV Healthcare \u00a3m Group \u00a3m Contingent consideration at beginning of the year 5,359 5,869 Re-measurement through income statement 1,026 cash flows (721) (742) Cash payments: investing activities (105) (114) Contingent consideration at end of the year 5,559 6,076 2020 ViiV Healthcare \u00a3m Group \u00a3m Contingent consideration at beginning of the year 5,103 5,479 Re-measurement through income statement 1,114 1,275 Cash payments: operating cash flows (751) (765) Cash payments: investing activities (107) (120) Contingent consideration at end of the year 5,359 5,869 Press release Q4 Results summary Total and Adjusted results Full year performance Quarterly performance Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 9 February 2022 , London, U.K . 59 The liabilities for the Pfizer put option and the contingent consideration at 31 December 20 21 have been calculated based on the period -end exchange rates, primarily US$ 1.35/\u00a31 and \u20ac1.19/\u00a31. Sensitivity analyses for the Pfizer put option and each of the largest contingent consideration liabilities are set out below.

Contingent liabilities There were contingent liabilities at 31 December 2021 in respect of guarante es and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary course of the Group's business. No material losses are expected to arise from such contingent liabilities. Provision is made for the outcome of legal and tax disputes where it is both probable that the Group will suffer an outflow of funds and it is possible to make a reliable estimate of that outflow. Descriptions of the significant legal disputes to which the Gro up is a party are set out on page 56. Post Balance Sheet Events On 1 February 2022, ViiV Healthcare reached agreement with Gilead to settle the global patent infringement litigation relating to the commercialisation of Gilead's Biktarvy. Under the terms of the global settlement agreement and patent licens e agreement, Gilead will make an upfront payment of $1.25 billion to ViiV Healthcare . Gilead will als o pay a 3% royalty on all future US sales of Biktarvy and in respect of the bictegravir component of any other future bictegravir -containing products sold in the US . These royalties will be payable by Gilead to ViiV Healthcare from 1 February 2022 until the expiry of ViiV Healthcare's US Patent No. 8,129,385 on 5 October 2027. Gilead's obligation to pay royalties does not extend into any period of regulatory paediatric exclusivity, if awarded. The impact of the sett lement in Q1 2022 will be to record the upfront payment of $1.25 billion received in other operating income in Total results and Adjusting items. Royalties receivable from 1 February 2022 on sales of Biktarvy and in respect of the bictegravir component of any other future bictegravir -containing products sold in the US will be recorded in royalty income in Total and Adjusted results. The upfront is a contingent asset at the balance sheet date. This is a post balance sheet event the income from which does not adjust the Group's financial statements at 31 December 2021 as the receipt was not virtually certain at the balance sheet date. Both the settlement and the future royalty income increase the fair value of the CCL to Shionogi and the Pfizer put option. Th is increase in carrying value has been reflected in GSK's 2021 full -year and fourth quarter 2021 results, and the associated charges are recorded within Adjusting items. Earnings are allocated to the three shareholders of ViiV Healthcare on the basis of t heir respective equity shareholdings (GSK 78.3%, Pfizer 11.7% and Shionogi 10%) and their entitlement to preferential dividends, which are determined by the performance of certain products that each shareholder contributed. In the cash flow statement, cash inflows from the upfront payment and future royalty income as well as the resultant incremental contingent consideration liability cash outflows will be recorded in cash generated from operations. The resulting increased dividends to Shionogi and Pfizer will be included within financing cashflow s. All values are pre -taxation.

GSK also uses a number of adjusted, non -IFRS, measures to report the performance of its business. Adjusted results and other non -IFRS measures may be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information presented in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted results are defined on page 10 and other non -IFRS measures are defined below. Free cash flow Free cash flow is defined as the net cash inflow/outflow from operating activities less capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, contingent consideration payments, net finance costs, and dividends paid to non -controlling interests plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and dividends received from joint ventures and associates. It is used by management for planning and reporting purposes and in discussions with and presentations to investment analysts and rating agencies. Free cash flow growth is calculated on a reported basis. A reconciliation of net cash inflow from operations to free cash flow is set out on page 60. Free cash flow conversion Free cash flow conversion is free cash flow as a percentage of earnings. Working capital Working capital represents inventory and trade receivables less trade payables. CER and AER growth In order to illustrate underlying performance, it is the Group's practice to discuss its results in terms of constant exchange rate (CER) growth. This represents growth calculated as if the exchange rates used to determine the results of overseas companies in Sterling had remained unchanged from those used in the comparative period. CER% represents growt h at constant exchange rates. \u00a3% or AER% represents growth at actual exchange rates. Pro-forma growth The acquisition of the Pfizer consumer healthcare business completed on 31 July 2019 and so GSK's reported results for 2020 included twelve months of re sults of the former Pfizer consumer healthcare business from 1 January 2020. The Group has presented in this Results Announcement reference to pro-forma growth rates at CER in 2020 for sales excluding brands divested /under review for Consumer Healthcare and sales for certain categories of consumer healthcare products taking account of this transaction. Pro-forma growth rates for the year are calculated comparing reported results for 2020, calculated applying the exchange rates used in the comparative period, with the results for 2019 adjusted to include the equivalent seven months of results of the former Pfizer consumer healthcare busine ss during 2019, as consolidated (in US$) and included in Pfizer's US GAAP results. 2 year Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR is defined as the compound annual growth rate and shows the annualised average rate of pro -forma revenue growth between two given years, assuming growth takes place at an exponentially compounded rate. For Consumer Healthcare, the 2 year revenue CAGR has been presented showing the annualised average rate of pro -forma revenue growth between 2019 and 2021.

Press release Q4 Results summary Total and Adjusted results Full year performance Quarterly performance Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 9 February 2022 , London, U.K . 62 Guidance , assumptions and cautionary statements 2022 guidance For n ew GSK we expect sales to grow between 5% to 7% at CER and Adjusted operating profit to grow between 12% to 14% at CER as compared with 2021. This guidance is provided at CER and excludes the commercial impact of COVID -19 solutions . Assumptions related to 2 022 guidance In outlining the guidance for 2022, the Group has made certain assumptions about the healthcare sector, the different markets in which the Group operates and the delivery of revenues and financial benefits from its current portfolio, pipeline and restructuring programmes. The Group also assumes that the demerger of our Consumer Healthcare business will be delivered in mid -2022 and this guidance relates only to new GSK. The Group has made planning assumptions for 2022 that healthcare systems will approach normality as the year progresses, and we expect sales of Specialty Medicines to grow approximately 10% at CER and sales of General Medicines to show a slight decrease, p rimarily reflecting increased genericisation of established Respiratory products. Vaccines sales are expected to grow at a low teens percentage at CER for the year as a whole. However, governments' prioritisation of COVID -19 vaccination programmes and ongo ing measures to contain the pandemic are expected to result in some continued disruption to adult immunisations, with the impact weighted to the first half. For Shingrix , despite the potential for short -term pandemic disruption, we continue to expect stron g double -digit growth and record annual sales based on strong demand in existing markets and geographical expansion. Guidance also includes the future benefit in royalty income from the settlement and license agreement with Gilead announced on 1 February 2 022. These planning assumptions as well as operating profit guidance and dividend expectations assume no material interruptions to supply of the Group's products, no material mergers, acquisitions or disposals, no material litigation or investigation cost s for the company (save for those that are already recognised or for which provisions have been made) and no change in the Group's shareholdings in ViiV Healthcare. The assumptions also assume no material changes in the healthcare environment or unexpected significant changes in pricing as a result of government or competitor action. The 2022 guidance factors in all divestments and product exits announced to date. The Group's guidance assumes successful delivery of the Group's integration and restructuring plans. It also assumes that the separation programme to deliver the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business is delivered successfully. Material costs for inv estment in new product launches and R&D have been factored into the expectations given. Given the potential development options in the Group's pipeline, the outlook may be affected by additional data -driven R&D investment decisions. The guidance is given on a constant currency basis. Assumptions and cautionary statement regarding forward -looking statements The Group's management believes that the assumptions outlined above are reasonable, and that the guidance, outlooks, ambitions and expectations describ ed in this report are achievable based on those assumptions.
