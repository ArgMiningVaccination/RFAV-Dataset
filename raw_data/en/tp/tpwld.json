CEASE therapy was developed by Dutch physician Tinus Smits M.D. who was looking for a way to help children with autism. CEASE stands for Complete Elimination Autism Spectrum Expression and Modern Disease and Dr. Smits helped well over 300 children with Autism prior to his death in 2010. While his method was originally designed for children with Autism and Autism Spectrum Expressions, Dr. Smits and those that he trained have experienced success treating a number of conditions including MS, Chronic Fatigue, allergies, ear infections, hyperactivity, and detoxification. CEASE therapy practitioners focus on the cause of the illness and will spend quality time on an intake to assess potential insults including: Vaccine Injuries, environmental toxins, dental work, medications, emotional symptoms, illnesses and more. The focus of CEASE is to remove energetic blockages by utilizing isopathic remedies and then support the system with inspiring and classical homeopathy as well as other approaches uniquely applied to each client's situation and circumstances. As each person is genetically and physiologically different, his or her response to pathogens, toxins and environmental stresses differs. With CEASE, we endeavour to find just the right support, clear out toxins at the right time and in the right order. This gives a consistent response and recovery to our clients. As a result, patients who start with CEASE therapy see a process that leads to harmony and balance on physical, emotional and mental levels. This is far more than just the elimination of symptoms. CEASE therapy to be most effective, it must be part of a more complete and broader system of medicine for restoring health. Our framework consists of isopathy, nosodes, drainage, energy blockages , miasms, orthomolecular supplements, diet and exercise. What do people have to say about CEASE Therapy? J.B. Handley of Generation Rescue has this to say, \"The CEASE approach stands out among many others for its clarity, simplicity and focus on cause\". With CEASE therapy the full potential for cure is realized only when all aspects of health are taken into consideration and applied in every case on an individualized basis\" CEASE therapy to be most effective, it must be part of a more complete and broader system of medicine for restoring health. Our framework consists of isopathy, nosodes, drainage, energy blockages , miasms, orthomolecular supplements, diet and exercise. Who is the CEASE Practitioner and how long does the appointment last and consultation last? Umangini (Uma) Desai CCH,RsHom(NA),BHMS studied with Kim Kalina (follower of Dr.Tinus Smits) has been successfully utilizing CEASE therapy to help children and adults with a variety of healthcare concerns. She is currently one of the few certified CEASE practitioners in the United States. She has been working as a Homeopath for past 14 years and helping children from the infancy, mothers during pregnancy and educating parents for past decade. She is reaching out to educate and restore the health with homeopathic remedies. The Initial consultation is an in-depth, confidential interview to record your physical, mental and emotional characteristics and symptoms. We'll review the parent's case history prior to conception and the mother's history during pregnancy, labor, birth and the first 2 years of the child's life to identify different causes This appointment may take up to two hours. In order to choose the correct remedy for you, a detailed understanding of who you are, along with any complaints and details of how you experience and deal with your symptoms is important to determine your treatment plan. If you are an adult patient, you will still need to complete all CEASE forms prior to your appointment. Follow up appointments: Please note that return visits are essential to evaluate your progress and to make necessary changes if needed. These appointments are 45 minutes and the intervals vary depending on the severity and complexity of the individual case. The first follow up appointment is 5-6 weeks after the first visit. What does CEASE THERAPY involve? CEASE therapy consists of the following: 1. Isotherapy 2. Orthomolecular support (nutritional supplements) 3. Inspiring & Classical Homeopathy The aim of CEASE therapy is a systematic detoxification of causative factors, leading to step-by-step improvements and restoration of health. Those who start with CEASE therapy see a process that leads to harmony and balance on the physical, emotional and mental level. This is far more than just the elimination of symptoms. Through administering specific homeopathic remedies (isopathy, tautopathy) that tackle head-on the causation which lead to toxic build-up, we get to the root of the problem, the real reasons behind the disorder. By following CEASE therapy, the body will be able to use its own innate ability to heal itself and regain a state of balance and harmony. In support of CEASE therapy, certain nutritional supplements are recommended to nourish the brain and restore proper intestinal function as part of successful treatment. 1) Isotherapy is the method of curing or removing the bad effects of vaccination, heavy metals toxicity, and allopathic drugs by means of identical, potentized homeopatic remedies. For example, if you are suffering from the side effects of penicillin, using potentized penicillin will remove the bad effects as well as its energetic imprints from the vital force. This has been confirmed not only clinically by a large number of CEASE practitioners, but has also been confirmed scientifically. 2) In support of isotherapy, use of certain nutrients are necessary to maximize your child's health: Omega-3 fatty acids.. Vitamin C to protect the brain against oxidative stress. Give extra zinc: 10mg for children under 4, 20mg from 4-8, and 30mg for children 9 years and older. Using probiotics and eating healthy organic food without sugar or additives is highly recommended to restore the integrity of the intestines. Why do we ask the details of the pregnancy and delivery? Greater awareness is necessary concerning the use of medical drugs during pregnancy and delivery. It's important for people to know that, during pregnancy and the first two years of life, the brain is extremely vulnerable and should be protected as much as possible. That's why medication during and after pregnancy and especially vaccination can be so toxic. Every unnatural chemical substance is potentially toxic. If the current vaccination schedule continues, a continuously and rapidly growing number of our children will become severely handicapped in the near future. What age does CEASE work with? As a certified CEASE practitioner, I treat everyone regardless of severity. With CEASE therapy, virtually everyone can improve considerably, even up to complete healing. CEASE therapy has the power to restore health rapidly, gently, and permanently. How does the CEASE THERAPY differ from other detox therapies? The aim of CEASE treatment is systematic detoxification of the causes of illness, and erasing the toxic imprint the potential insult might have done to your body, leading to step by step improvement and restoration of health in the individual. How can I detox something which I was exposed to in the past? CEASE takes a systematic approach, detoxing your body from BPA, antibiotics, medications, etc. and helps bring you back to balance. How to Detox from BPA? CEASE Therapy - BPA detox homeopathics are available and used during an overall CEASE Therapy program. CEASE takes a systematic approach, detoxing your body from BPA, antibiotics, medications, etc. and helps bring you back to balance. BPA detox has been used as part of CEASE Therapy since its inception and has helped many children with autism and well as adults. What if the child was not vaccinated and still has Autism or Autism Spectrum Disorder? CEASE Therapy will still help as it has one of the component, the classical homeopathy which helps restore you to have a good health. Many times during case taking, parents may realise that mother has taken some medicine during pregnancy or mother was exposed to environmental toxins etc. i.e. using deodorant with Aluminium etc. Does it have any side effects? During the detox, you may have fever, rash, diarrhoea etc. Certain Homeopathic Cell Salts or natural measures are given so you can go through the detox easily. Does Homeopathy have alternatives to Vaccination? Yes. Homeoprophylaxis is available if one is interested. Note: CEASE Therapy is also not for Vaccine Clearing only. If someone had reactions to medications, antibiotics and has changed their health, it can be utilised for that as well. "}
