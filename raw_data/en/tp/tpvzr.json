Grants awarded under this program are intended to improve research capability through the support of a group of scientists and engineers , including graduate students and post -doctoral fellows , working on a common scientific theme in one or more than one EP SCoR jurisdictions. These awards are not appropriate mechanisms to provide support for individual faculty science and technology research projects. While the academic, non -profit and industrial research community is welcome to lead or to participate in a pplications, a strong component of graduate student education is required for all applicants. DOE EPSCoR currently follows eligibility determinations made by the National 2 Science Foundation Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (NSF EPSCoR ) for its Research Infrastructure Improvement program. Thus, entities located within the following jurisdictions will be eligible to apply under this FOA: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mississ ippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, Virgin Islands, West Virginia, and Wyoming. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Program Objectives The U.S. Department of Energy's Established Program to Stimul ate Competitive Research (DOE E PSCoR) is a federal-state partnership p rogram designed to: Enhance the capabiliti es of designated jurisdictions to condu ct sust ainable and nationally competitive energy-related re search through increased hum an and technical resources, including training of scientists and engineers. Advance DOE 's overarching mission by suppo rting early stage research and developm ent for a wide range of topical area s across the Department: o Office of Science: Advanced Scientific Computing Research , Basic Energy Sciences, Biological and Envi ronmental Research, Fusion En ergy Sciences, High Energy Physics, and Nuclear Physics o Technology Offices: Electricity, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Envi ronmental Management, Fossil Energy, Nuclear Energy, and the National Nuclear Security Administ ration. The objectives of the DOE EPSCoR Implementation G rants are to: Jumpstart capability developm ent in the jurisdiction(s) through increased hum an and techn ical resources. Suppo rt a group of researchers working on a common s cientific theme, with mutually supporting goals and objectives. When topically relevant to the subject matter of the application, promote collaborations with other institutions of higher education and indust ry with st rong participation by students, postdo ctoral fellows, and junior faculty from EPSCoR eligible institutions . These collaborations may include institutions from other EPSCoR jurisdictions. Collaborations involving more than one institution or more than one EPSCoR jurisdiction, while welcome, are not a requirement. DOE EPSCoR also encourages but does not require implementation grants to wo rk toward building beneficial relationships b etween institut ions in E PSCoR jurisdictions and the 10 wo rld- class Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) m anaged by the Office of Science. These institutions offer opportunities to leverage capabilities of DOE national user facilities and develop int ellectual collaborations that may not be available locally. Please refer to the section on funding limitations below for limitations on national laboratory participation. To further the success of the federal -state partnership and of the implementation grants in general, applicants must be aware of the following expectations : 3 1. Appli cations must present the oppo rtunities for enhanced academic research and developm ent competitiveness and if appropriate, industrial or economic competitiveness, for the jurisdiction, in cluding plans for the acquisition of sustained non -EPSCoR suppo rt. 2. Applications must exhibit a coherent focus on one DOE -related research area bringing together multiple researchers. 3. Applications must present a management plan for coordinating multiple inv estigators working on a common th eme. This must include performance milestones and a timetable for achieving project goals and deliverables. Adequate provision for substantive time commitment by the principal investigator , the research team and appropriate administrative support is an important factor contributing to the success of Implementation Grants. Previous experience indicates that strong external advisory boards are also a useful tool to assist in management of Implementation Gr ant awards. DOE EPSCoR strongly encourages their formation and regular use. 4. Applications must include letters of commitment/endorsement as noted below under: a) Principal Investigator and Project Director Roles ; and in the subsections labelled: b) LETTERS ; c) Appendix 7: Letters of Commitment and Endorsement 5. DOE E PSCoR reserves the right to give priority to applications that propose to develop new research areas rather than those that propose to enhance or continue research areas that have been previous ly funded under EPSCoR implementation grants . Other program policy and selection criteria are described in subsection 2 of Section V B, REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS . Applications must identify t he topical research area or areas with respect to the relevant DOE program office or offices (listed below) and the office's specific program goals. Please review the websites for information on the o ffice's goals as well as reviewing the section on topics identified of special interest and disinterest below .

Computing technology (including high performance and exascale approaches) and quantum information science (including simulation, sensors, and algorithms) that relate to and impact high-energy physics are also of interest . Areas of specific disinterest are those that are not in alignment with the P5 report and HEP program priorities. These include heavy ion physics, neutrinoless double beta decay, the LHCb experiment, classical gravitati onal physics, classical astrophysics, and future gamma and cosmic ray experiments. For Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy In Advanced Manufacturing Technologies For Hybrid/Integrated Chemical Reaction -Separation - background: Most chemical processes begin with a reaction and are followed by a separation of the product mixture into desired product, unreacted feedstock, and unwanted by -products. The unreacted feedstock and unwanted by -products are recycled back to the reactor. Si nce most industrial reactions have typically low conversions and selectivity's , the separation train is usually both energy and capital intensive. Similarly, the recycle loop is usually large, resulting in large electrical energy required to pump the liqui ds or compress the gases in order to move the fluids around. 8 Area of interest include: integrated reactor and separation technologies that improve both reactions and separations together, especially using non -thermal processes like reactive distillation , membrane reactors and ionic reaction media to result in simplified processes. Reactions and separations in the chemical industry are coupled and therefore problems associated with either one of them must be solved simultaneously. This would be the most effective way to deal with the coupled nature of process reaction and separation and provides the opportunity to break non-idealities like reaction equilibriums, isomers separation, and azeotropes. For Ionic Liquids for Improved Chemical Reactions and Se parations - background: Molecular design and synthesis of new ionic liquids (I ls) with different functionalities has expanded the scope of applications for io nic liquids . Ils are unique organic salts composed entirely of ions, typically large poor coordina ting organic cations and small inorganic anions, resulting in highly polar molecules. The use of I ls has grown beyond their advantage over conventional organics solvents in the development of green technologies to other areas like reaction media and cataly sis, separations (especially azeotropes) , battery electrolytes, lubricants, and so on. Areas of interest include: better understanding of molecular interactions between ionic liquids and other fluids in order to develop better separation methods to get pur e and more stable I ls. For Materials for Sensors in Harsh Environments - background: Sensor materials responding to changes in stress, temperature, composition, electromagnetic and gravitational fields are well characterized for many applications, but th ere are few sensor materials capable of withstanding harsh environments of high temperature, high stress, and corrosive environments. This is especially true for microelectronic and micromechanical sensors, which are typically silicon based. Areas of In terest: Exploratory investigations in materials capable of converting or generating a measurable signal related to their environments are warranted, and especially so for environments regarded as too extreme for available sensor use. It would be useful fo r such sensors to be integrated into a wireless configuration. Example end uses include gas turbines, high temperature furnaces, and corrosive environments such as supercritical CO 2. ADDITIONAL (GENERAL) AREAS FOR CONSIDERATION Some experimentation into electro processes and what is happening, for example, covetics, e nhanced forming, plasma and microwave interaction within carbon fiber production, laser and e -beam and x -Ray and neutron interactions with materials such as used in additive manufacturing , etc. In Fuel Cell Technologies \u2014 An area of specific interest is the development of new physics -based multi -scale theoretical and computational models to accelerate the discovery and development of engineered materials and interfaces for key hydrogen and fuel cell applications. Specific subtopics of interest within the program are listed below. For PGM -Free Catalysts for Fuel Cells \u2014background: The development of high -9 performance, durable PGM -free catalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM ) and alkali ne electrolyte membrane (AEM) fuel cells critically depends on modeling methodologies that provide a fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism, such as helping elucidate the active site of these catalysts, improve the understanding of catalyst de gradation, and are predictive in nature. Multi -scale modeling approaches to understand the catalyst in the context of the reaction environment, approaches to determine materials that can replace iron (Fe) as the main constituent in current state of the art PGM -free oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, and approaches to quantify and describe catalyst durability, among others, are needed. An area of specific interest is the development of high -throughput, predictive models to the accelerate discovery and development of PGM -free catalysts for fuel cells. Models relating to PEM ORR catalysts, as well as to PGM -free AEM ORR and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts are of interest. For Hydrogen Storage Materials \u2014background: Multi -scale models to p redict reactive solid interfaces are critical to the advancement of breakthrough materials systems for hydrogen storage. Nearly all advanced nucleation and growth models rely on an accurate description of the thermodynamics and kinetics of solid -solid int erfaces. In complex light metal hydrides, these interfaces are particularly complicated, since they are multicomponent, incoherent, and involve molecular reactions. An area of specific interest is the development a reliable theoretical formalism for integrating the necessary first principles -derived ingredients (chemical reaction, defect formation/migration, and solid -state diffusion kinetics) to give a good model for the structure/chemistry, energetics, and dynamics of reactive interfaces relevant to viable hydrogen storage materials. For Hydrogen Compatible Materials for Infrastructure \u2014background: A physics -based understanding of materials compatibility in hydroge n environments is critical for reliable performance of technologies in a broad range of sectors (e.g. structures in offshore environments, hydrogen tube trailers and storage vessels, welding of pipelines, etc.). Current macroscopic models of hydrogen indu ced damage rely heavily on empirical data and trends rather than a foundational, constitutive understanding of nano -and micro - structural scale phenomena. An area of specific interest is the derivation of predictive relationship of materials compatibility with hydrogen, based on an integrative approach leveraging advanced multi -scale/multi -physics computational theory in conjunction with state -of-the-art characterization techniques (such as in -situ neutron diffraction imaging). Areas of interest include: characterization and prediction of the behavior of short cracks that behave in a nonlinear fashion, use of oligocrystals to study interactions between hydrogen and grain boundaries, exploration of innovative techniques to characterize materials compatibili ty without the use of high -pressure hydrogen chambers (e.g. using inerting gases), and modeling of the behavior of polymers in hydrogen at an atomistic scale. 10 For Hydrogen Production Materials \u2014background: Multi -scale/multi -physics approaches to model rea ctive solid -solid and solid -liquid interfaces are critical to the advancement of breakthrough materials systems for hydrogen production by water splitting. Effective models must address the thermodynamic and kinetic pheno mena of multiple materials and interfaces, as well as electronic, ionic and mass transport effects over multiple time and length scales. In direct solar water splitting pathways, fundamental light -matter interac tions also need to be accounted for. Areas of specific disinterest across fuel cell technologies include models of hydrogen production materials systems (which is being addressed in the HydroGEN Consortium) and composite materials relevant to compressed hydrogen storage tanks. Another area of specific interest is in discovery a nd development of scalable, and efficient approaches for liquefaction. Conventional liquefaction cycles (e.g. for natural gas, hydrogen, etc.) rely on mechanical cycles (e.g. compression, throttling) that are inherently inefficient. For example, liquefac tion of hydrogen utilizes heat transfer fluid along with mechanical equipment to achieve a temperature of 20K, and consumes 10 -15 kWh/kg. Alternative approaches with potential to achieve step -change improvements in liquefaction efficiency are of interest. Examples include: 1) the development and evaluation of acoustic liquefaction concepts; 2) the discovery, development, and evaluation of caloric materials (e.g. elastocaloric, electrocaloric, and magnetocaloric materials) for use in liquefaction; 3) the d evelopment of highly efficient, low -cost cryocoolers for use in hydrogen liquefaction; and 4) the discovery and development of catalysts for isomeric conversions of hydrogen (e.g. from para to ortho form). In Solid State Lighting Practical LED advancem ents have outpaced the fundamental semiconductor physics, materials science, semiconductor device understanding of the LED devices themselves. In order to accelerate understanding of the underlying LED science that can lead to future LED performance adva ncements, we propose the following R&D topics: 1) modeling of LED materials -device -synthesis relationships and expected performance, and 2) characterization of alternative LED materials. These topics are related and can have overlap depending on the capab ilities of research institution. Developing a predictive model for LED performance based on materials properties, device structures, and synthesis possibilities could guide R&D advancements in all three aspects of LED design - materials, device, and synth esis. Currently, there is only limited capability to predict LED performance for the most mature LED materials a nd predictive models for less mature LED materials routinely fall short, for example, predictions of ZnO LED, non -polar and semipolar GaN LED, dilute nitrides LED, etc. Historically, LED advancements have come from experimental progress; but given the vast array of materials combinations, there may be materials -device -synthesis combinations that are favorable for developing new LED technologies. This proposed topic could be categorized as an underpinning for 'materials by design', if a reliable, materials agnostic, predictive model could be developed. 11 The second, related, topic would be to develop and apply a standard characterization approac h for LEDs of all materials systems, so their performance and limitations can be readily compared. LED characterization information could feed into the LED modeling topic. LED characterizations could be based on experimental results that are performed first-hand by the research institution or based on literature based results. However, it would be important to understand the shortcoming of the various LEDs which are not always apparent in the published literature results. A broad effort to characterize the performance of wide array of LED materials could result in a 'library' of LED information that includes materials, devices, and synthesis techniques. With the development of both of these R&D topics a feedback loop could be created that provides a process for prediction -synthesis -characterization of LEDs. Both of the described R&D topics require a large level of effort across a wide range of institutions but could also be a stepping stone for developing institutional expertise within the topic of LED materials and device science. Both of these topics would also support the objectives of the DOE SSL R&D Program. In order to reach the ultimate DOE SSL Program targets for LED lighting efficacy, breakthroughs will be necessary to achieve the require d LED efficiency at green, amber, and red emission wavelengths. R&D results that can be used to further guide R&D approaches to achieve these breakthroughs will be highly valuable for enabling more effective use of R&D funds. The proposed R&D topics wou ld also likely have crossover benefits for other optoelectronic device development, including lasers, photovoltaics, displays, and more. In Solar Energy Technologies \u2014 The Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) supports the development of solar technologies that decrease the cost of solar generated electricity to utilities and consumers. Areas of interest for the development of solar technologies have been outlined in prev iously released FOAs , however a brief list is included here to guide applicants: For photovoltaic systems : Areas of interest include: stable, high performance photovoltaic absorber materials and cell architectures to enable module efficiencies above 25%; fundamental understanding of the degradation mechanisms for PV materials; durable, transparent polymer substrate and packaging materials; new materials and processes for metallizatio n; development of new characterization techniques to enable understanding of high performance PV materials and devices; novel charge separation and solar energy harvesting materials and mechanisms for converting solar energy to electricity and/or fuels. for concentrating solar power technologies : Areas of interest include: thermal energy storage materials and technologies for operati on > 700 \u00b0 C, including thermochemical endothermic/exothermic cycles, phase change materials, and the encapsulation of phase change materials; methods for low -loss broad -solar -spectrum optical concentration that do not require tracking; novel materials or concepts to enable low -cost transport of pressurized fluids at > 700 \u00b0C, including robust high -temperature thin film insulators ; development of passive corrosion control mechanisms for molten chloride salts operating between 450 and 800 \u00b0C; novel materials or concepts to enable passive thermal transport or control in CSP systems . 12 for systems integration : Areas of interest include: interaction of solar PV power electronics and legacy control devices in electric power systems, inverter -dominated network control, scalable dynamic system modeling for power system operation, enhanced protection for solar PV and power systems, and grid services provided by distributed energy resources. for soft costs : Areas of interest include: impacts of public policy on technological development speed and verified breakthroughs; behavioral dynamics and decision science with regards to adoption (person al or organizational) of new technologies; identification and analysis of non -economic drivers of technological adoption; analysis of novel business models and their influence on technological adoption ; analysis of the adoption of new technologies and its drivers for low -income individuals or communities; methods to increase solar energy access for low -income individuals; analysis for the potential use of block chain for solar energy management and transactions.

For Fossil Energy Multi -functional Catalyst Research and Development - N.B. Background information in support of this topic is available at the linked file. As outlined in the background section for this topic , the reduction of flaring through the direct conversion of methane is a multifaceted problem. High-productivity catalysts are needed that can mimic the conversion processes that are found in methanotrophic and other organisms, while possessing robust properties consistent with the challenging operating conditions and constraints found at remote production sites . Additionally separation materials (i.e., membranes, sorbents or solvents) are nee ded that can be integrated into a multi -functional reactor, which can simultaneously: Pretreat the associated gas feed to remove impurities, such as H 2S, and condensable hydrocarbons, such as propane, butanes and C5+ compounds (as necessary) Directly conve rt methane alone, or in combination with ethane and/or CO 2, into easily transported, value -added intermediates or finished products (to be identified and proposed by the applicant) Fractionation of the reaction raw products to recover the desired product (s) and recycle unconverted reactants Proposals to this topic area should be directed toward: 1. Identifying pathways for synthesizing and separating products identified by the applicant based on specified feeds 13 2. Molecular design of high -productivity cataly sts and materials that can mimic and improve upon conversion processes found in methanotrophic and other natural organisms 3. In silico screening of proposed catalyst and separation material(s) formulations for the pathways identified in (1), reflecting both stand -alone and integrated catalysis and separation systems 4. Bench -scale screening of most promising catalysts and materials identified in (2) Others areas of particular interest for this topic area include: Co-conversion of ethane, CO 2 or both; Chemis tries that employ CO 2 as a source of carbon, oxygen or both in the final product Chemistries that make use of excess hydrogen in methane to provide the energy requirements of the conversion reaction Production of economically -transportable products Initially target high -value, small volume product markets but can pivot toward commodity markets as the technology develops and matures Technology platforms capable of producing a variety of products using the same or similar catalysts Catalysts integrated with other materials and used for simultaneous conversion, feed gas purification, fractionation of products, and removal of unconverted reactants Areas considered outside the scope for this topic area include: Biological conversions based on gas fermentation Indirect conversion processes that involve gaseous intermediates, such as synthesis gas (CO+H 2) Non-conversion uses for waste methane, such as oil reservoir pressure management Research focused on developing actual industrial reactor and separation equipme nt, and process design and integration Other critical aspects of mitigating flaring that are not of interest for the EPSCoR FOA are: o 1)Multi -functional, Compact Equipment Development and Design - process intensification will need to be used to minimize processing steps and combine process unit operations into a minimum number of compact modules that can be easily transported and relocated in remote areas and o 2) Energy -efficient Process Development and Integration - modular components of a conversion tec hnology will need to be highly integrated, since process utilities must be minimized at remote sites. The s ystem will also need to be operable under a wide range of varying operating conditions. Advanced process control systems incorporating real -time si mulation will also need to be developed and tested to ensure the complete system can perform under real - world operating conditions. However, applicants need to carefully consider these latter aspects in formulating their R&D approach to ensure that catalysts and materials developed through their research are holistically applicable to solving the flaring problem. Applicants are also 14 advised that successful catalysts and materials developed under this EPSCoR funded project may be of interest to DOE' s Office of Fossil Energy in the future, should the Office pursue the development and demonstration of technologies addressing aspects one and t wo above. Selenium Reclamation from Amine Solvents N.B. Background information in support of this topic is available at the linked file. Solvent reclamation can be an important component of advancing the future deployment of carbon capture technologies. This topic requests R&D to develop solvent reclamation techniques that can be used to reclaim selenium (with or without other metals) fro m amine solvents. It is anticipated that the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the proposed work will be TRL 3. Anticipated work scope includes laboratory -based R&D where selenium remediation/removal technologies are developed and tested on amine solvents contaminated with selenium and/or other metals. In addition to a final report, a techno - economic analysis (TEA) will be required that presents the cost for the solvent mitigation(s) proposed. The TEA can follow guidance provided by DOE's National Energy Technology Laboratory. Energy Advanced Reactor Materials High -temperature, radiation damage and corrosion -resistant materials for use in molten salt systems. Materials that employ microstructure features to minimize neutron induced loss of creep ductility in nickel -based alloys are especially desirable. Materials that maintain desirable performance attributes at temperatures above 750 \u00b0C and can be readily formed and joined are especially desirable. Functional materials for valves, filters , control elements and drive mechanisms, gaskets, impulse lines, bellows, and optical windows for molten salts. 15 Molten Salt Chemistry An area of specific interest is molten salt chemistry, including (i) low -uncertainty molten salt thermochemical and ther mophysical properties for advanced nuclear systems, (ii) practical techniques for implementing chemical control at MSRs, (iii) phase equilibria and diagram data for molten salt bearing actinides and fission products, and (iv) fuel -salt iodine removal techn iques to minimize potential accident source term. Instrumentation and techniques to rapidly and inexpensively assess the trace impurity levels of newly received salts. Low-cost, large -scale chlorine isotope separation techniques. High thermal neutron cr oss section lanthanide element separation techniques from fuel salt without prior actinide removal. Techniques to process used fuel salts into stable waste forms. Nuclear Data Areas of interest include improving nuclear data for actinides and chlorine, including neutron cross section refinement and covariance data for advanced nuclear fuels and reactors. Advanced Manufacturing Techniques to apply high -quality, corrosion resistant layers/coatings (carbides, nitrides, phosphides, refractory or noble metals, etc.) to high -temperature structural alloys for molten salt reactors. Techniques suitable for long heat exchanger tubes and complex geometries are especially desirable. Suitability for deployment in a high neutron flux environment is also desired . Tooling and techniques to support rapid replacement of used components to minimize outage intervals. Instrumentation Low uncertainty heat balance instruments and measurement techniques (mass flow and temperature difference) for utility scale molten sal t coolant lines. Rapid quantification instrumentation and techniques for residual fissile materials on used components and filters being removed from the reactor containment. Plant instrumentation to assess the composition (corrosion products, actinide i sotopes, tritium, oxygen) of small, periodically withdrawn, highly radioactive fuel salt samples. Techniques and tooling to support remote replacement or recalibration of sensors within a high-radiation containment. 16 Areas of specific disinterest across nuclear energy technologies include : Fissile material separation technologies. Funding Limitations DOE E PSCoR funding will neither be awarded to DOE National Laboratories or other Federally Funded Research and Development Centers FFRDCs nor to non-EPSCoR jurisdictions either as the awardee or as a subawardee. Awardees may use EPSCoR funding to provide travel reimbursement for FFRDC and non -EPSCoR state collaborators for on -site experiments and collaborations. Applications requesting consultant costs wil l need to explain: how the overall consultant costs are in line with the EPSCoR mission and how the skills, expertise or capabilities provided by the consultant will be transferred in a sustainable manner to the applicant institution. No funds provided in any award, subaward or other relationship resulting from this Funding Opportunity Announcement may be used for purposes of construction, alteration, renovation, or the purchase of real property. Applications containing such requested costs will be rejected without further review or consideration. After an initial project p eriod of up to two years , renewal applications will be considered for up to two a ddition al project p eriods of up to two years each. Renewal applications will subject to peer review. Consideration in the decision process for renewals will include but are not limited to: continuing meritorious p erformance and progress in the previous award period, continuing commitment to the effort on behalf of the awardee institution(s) and the jurisdiction, continuing program office need at DOE , DOE p rogram office commitm ent to the effort, and the availability of funds. Requests for continuation funding and renewal funding will also be evaluated for adherence to the Office of Science Public Access Plan for publications and in clusion of appropriate acknowledgements in peer reviewed and technical publications. Collaboration - Subawards If multiple EPSCoR institutions wish to collaborate on an app lication then they must choose one institution as the lead. The lead institution will submit the application with the other EPSCoR participants receiving support as subawardees. EPSCoR participants receiving funding as subawardees must be also located in a cceptable EPSCoR jur isdictions listed in Section III A . Formal collaborative pre -applications or applications, in which each proposing institution partnering on the research submits an application separately to DOE, will be deemed non - responsive to the FOA. Again, no funding on under these awards may be sub awarded to FFRDCs. Princip al Investigator and Project Director Roles: For this EPSCoR FOA, each application will have a single principal investigator (PI) with other scientific/technical participants having a role of \"Co -Investigator\" (Co -I). It is recomm ended that the PI be the lead technical director for the application and have affiliation with the lead institution or organization. If it is advantageous to the management of the research, s /he should work under a specified Project Director (PD) who may help coordinate research efforts 17 particularly if it involves multiple organizations or institutions. The PD and PI must provide signed statement s that reflects their commitment to the project, including the level of time commitment. These letters of commitment are limited to one page each. Principal Investigators Meetings, Program Meetings, Reviews While the EPSCoR program does not have annual meetings, PIs should budget for and plan on attending DOE program meetings relevant to the proposed research. Such meetings may occur on an annual or biennial basis. DOE EPSCoR may conduct on -site or reverse -site visit reviews. It is advisable to build in flexibility to accommodate for these possibilities as well.

GRANTS.GOV APPLICATION SUBMISSION AND RECEIPT PROCEDURES This section provides the application submission and receipt instructions for applications to SC. Please read the following instructions carefully and completely. 1. Electronic Delivery SC is participating in the Grants.gov initiative to provide the grant community with a single site to find and apply for grant funding opportunities. SC requires applicants to submit their applications online through Grants.gov. 2. How to Register to Apply through Grants.gov a. Instructions: Read the instructions below about registering to apply for SC funds. Applicants should read the registration instructions carefully and prepare the information requested before beginning the registration process. Reviewing and assembling the required information before beginning the registration process will alleviate last-minute searches for required information. Organizations must have a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number, active System for Award Management (SAM) registration, and Grants.gov account to apply for grants. If individual applicants are eligible to apply for this funding opportunity, then you should begin with step 3, Create a Grants.gov Account, listed below. Creating a Grants.gov account can be completed online in minutes, but DUNS and SAM registrations may take several weeks. Therefore, an organization 's registration should be done in sufficient time to ensure it does not impact the entity 's ability to meet required application submission deadlines. Complete organization instructions can be found on Grants.gov here: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization -registration.html 1) Obtain a DUNS Number : All entities applying for funding, including renewal funding, must have a DUNS Number from Dun & Bradstreet (D&B). Applicants must enter the DUNS Number in the data entry field labeled \"Organizational DUNS \" on the SF-424 form. For more detailed instructions for obtaining a refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization -registration/step -1-obtain -duns - number.html 2) Register with SAM : All organizations applying online through Grants.gov must register with SAM at https://www.sam.gov . Failure to register with SAM will prevent your organization from applying through Grants.gov. SAM registration must be renewed annually. For more detailed instructions for registering with SAM, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organizat ion-registration/step -2-register -with- sam.html 28 3) Create a Grants.gov Account : The next step is to register an account with Grants.gov. Follow the on-screen instructions or refer to the detailed instructions here: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration.html 4) Add a Profile to a Grants.gov Account : A profile in Grants.gov corresponds to a single applicant organization the user represents (i.e., an applicant) or an individual applicant. If you work for or consult with multiple organizations and have a profile for each, you may log in to one Grants.gov account to access all of your grant applications. To add an organizational profile to your Grants.gov account, enter the DUNS Number for the organization in the DUNS field while adding a profile. For more detailed instructions about creating a profile on Grants.gov, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/add -profile.html 5) EBiz POC Authorized Profile Roles : After you register with Grants.gov and create an Organization Applicant Profile, the organization applicant 's request for Grants.gov roles and access is sent to the EBiz POC. The EBiz POC will then log in to Grants.gov and authorize the appropriate roles, which may include the AOR role, thereby giving you permission to complete and submit applications on behalf of the organization. You will be able to submit your application online any time after you have been assigned the AOR role. For more detailed instructions about creating a profile on Grants.gov, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/authorize -roles.html 6) Track Role Status : To track your role request, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/track -role-status.html b. Electronic Signature : When applications are submitted through Grants.gov, the name of the organization applicant with the AOR role that submitted the application is inserted into the signature line of the application, serving as the electronic signature. The EBiz POC must authorize people who are able to make legally binding commitments on behalf of the organization as a user with the AOR role; this step is often missed and it is crucial for valid and timely submissions. 3.

DOE SC Portfolio Analysis and Management System (PAMS) After you submit your application through grants.gov, the application will automatically transfer into the PAMS for processing by the DOE SC. Many functions for grants and cooperative agreements can be done in PAMS, which is available at https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov . You will want to \"register to\" your application: a process of linking yourself to the application after it has been submitted through grants.gov and processed by DOE. You must register in PAMS to submit a pre-application or a letter of intent. You may use the Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, or Safari browsers to access PAMS. Notifications sent from the PAMS system will come from the PAMS email addre ss <PAMS.Autoreply@science.doe.gov >. Please make sure your email server/software allows delivery of emails from the PAMS email address to yours. 50 Registering to PAMS is a two-step process; once you create an individual account, you must associate yourself with (\"register to\") your institution. Detailed steps are listed below. 1. CREATE PAMS ACCOUNT : To register, click the \"Create New PAMS Account \" link on the website https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov/ . Click the \"No, I have never had an account \" link and then the \"Create Account \" button. You will be prompted to enter your name and email address, create a username and password, and select a security question and answer. Once you have done this, click the \"Save and Continue \" button. On the next page, enter the required information (at least one phone number and your mailing address) and any optional information you wish to provide (e.g., FAX number, website, mailstop code, additional email addresses or phone numbers, Division/Department). Click the \"Create Account \" button. Read the user agreement and click the \"Accept \" button to indicate that you understand your responsibilities and agree to comply with the rules of behavior for PAMS. PAMS will take you to the \"Having Trouble Logging In?\" page. (If you have been an SC merit reviewer or if you have previously submitted an application, you may alread y be linked to an institution in PAMS. If this happens, you will be taken to the PAMS home page.) 2. REGISTER TO YOUR INSTITUTION : Click the link labeled \"Option 2: I know my institution and I am here to register to the institution. \" (Note: If you previously created a PAMS account but did not register to an institution at that time, you must click the Institutions tab and click the \"Register to Institution \" link.) PAMS will take you to the \"Register to Institution \" page. Type a word or phrase from your institution name in the field labeled, \"Institution Name like,\" choose the radio button next to the item that best describes your role in the system, and click the \"Search \" button. A \"like\" search in PAMS returns results that contain the word or phrase you enter; you do not need to enter the exact name of the institution, but you should enter a word or phrase contained within the institution name. (If your institution has a frequently used acronym, such as ANL for Argonne National Laboratory or UCLA for the Regents of the University of California, Los Angeles, you may find it easiest to search for the acronym under \"Institution Name like.\" Many institutions with acronyms are listed in PAMS with their acronyms in parentheses after their names.) Find your institution in the list that is returned by the search and click the \"Actions \" link in the Options column next to the institution name to obtain a dropdown list. Select \"Add me to this institution \" from the dropdown. PAMS will take you to the \"Institutions - List\" page. If you do not see your institution in the initial search results, you can search again by clicking the \"Cancel \" button, clicking the Option 2 link, and repeating the search. If, after searching, you think your institution is not currently in the database, click the \"Cannot Find My Institution \" button and enter the requested institution information into PAMS. Click the \"Create Institution \" button. PAMS will add the institution to the system, 51 associate your profile with the new institution, and return you to the \"Institutions - List\" page when you are finished.

C. COMMITMENT OF PUBLIC FUNDS (a) A DOE financial assistance award is valid only if it is in writing and is signed, either in writing or electronically, by a DOE Contracting Officer. (b) Recipients are free to accept or reject the award. A request to draw down DOE funds constitutes the Recipient 's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Award. D. PROPRIETARY APPLICATION INFORMATION Patentable ideas, trade secrets, proprietary or confidential commercial or financial information, disclosure of which may harm the applicant, should be included in an application only when such information is necessary to convey an understanding of the proposed project. The use and disclosure of such data may be restricted, provided the applicant includes the following legend on the first page of the project narrative and specifies the pages of the application which are to be restricted: \"The data contained in pages _____ of this application have been submitted in confidence and contain trade secrets or proprietary information, and such data shall be used or disclosed only for evaluation purposes, provided that if this applicant receives an award as a result of or in connection with the submission of this application, DOE shall have the right to use or disclose the data herein to the extent provided in the award. This restriction does not limit the government 's right to use or disclose data obtained without restriction from any source, including the applicant. \" To protect such data, each line or paragraph on the pages containing such data must be specifically identified and marked with a legend similar to the following: \"The following contains proprietary information that (name of applicant) requests not be released to persons outside the Government, except for purposes of review and evaluation. \" 65 E. EVALUATION AND ADMINISTRATION BY NON -FEDERAL PERSONNEL In conducting the merit review evaluation, the Government may seek the advice of qualified non-Federal personnel as reviewers. The Government may also use non-Federal personnel to conduct routine, nondiscretionary administrative activities. The applicant, by submitting its application, consents to the use of non-Federal reviewers/administrators. Non-Federal reviewers must sign conflict of interest agreement prior to reviewing an application. Non-Federal personnel conducting administrative activities must sign a non-disclosure agreement. F. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED UNDER THIS PROGRAM Patent Rights : The government will have certain statutory rights in an invention that is conceived or first actually reduced to practice under a DOE award. 42 USC 5908 provides that title to such inventions vests in the United States, except where 35 USC 202 provides otherwise for nonprofit organizations or small business firms. However, the Secretary of Energy may waive all or any part of the rights of the United States subject to certain conditions. (See \"Notice of Right to Request Patent Waiver \" in paragraph G below.) Rights in Technical Data : Normally, the government has unlimited rights in technical data created under a DOE agreement. Delivery or third party licensing of proprietary software or data developed solely at private expense will not normally be required except as specifically negotiated in a particular agreement to satisfy DOE 's own needs or to insure the commercialization of technology developed under a DOE agreement. G. NOTICE OF RIGHT TO REQUEST PATENT WAIVER Applicants may request a waiver of all or any part of the rights of the United States in inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in performance of an agreement as a result of this FOA, in advance of or within 30 days after the effective date of the award. Even if such advance waiver is not requested or the request is denied, the recipient will have a continuing right under the award to request a waiver of the rights of the United States in identified inventions, i.e., individual inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in performance of the award. Any patent waiver that may be granted is subject to certain terms and conditions in 10 CFR 784. For more businesses and domestic nonprofit organizations will receive the patent rights clause at 37 CFR 401.14, i.e., the implementation of the Bayh -Dole Act. This clause permits domestic small business and domestic nonprofit organizations to retain title to subject inventions. Therefore, small businesses and nonprofit organizations do not need to request a waiver. H. NOTICE REGARDING ELIGIBLE/INELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES Eligible activities under this program include those , which describe and promote the understanding of scientific and technical aspects of specific energy technologies, but not those 66 which encourage or support political activities such as the collection and dissemination of information related to potential, planned or pending legislation. I. AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS Funds are not presently available for this award. The Government 's obligation under this award is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for award purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this award and until the awardee receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer. J. ENVIRONMENTAL, SAFETY AND HEALTH (ES&H) PERFORMANCE OFWORK AT DOE FACILITIES With respect to the performance of any portion of the work under this award which is performed at a DOE -owned or controlled site, the recipient agrees to comply with all state and Federal ES&H regulations, and with all other ES&H requirements of the operator of such site. Prior to the performance on any work at a DOE -Owned or controlled site, the recipient shall contact the site facility manager for information on DOE and site specific ES&H requirements. The recipient shall apply this provision to all subawardees at any tier. K. FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL REQUIREMENTS With respect to the performance of any portion of the work under this award, the recipient agrees to comply with all applicable local, state, and Federal ES&H regulations. The recipient shall apply this provision to all sub awardees at any tier. L. NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT (NEPA) COMPLIANCE If question 4.a. on the \"Research and Related Other Project Information \" document indicates \"potential impact on the environment \", or if DOE 's own review indicates it, DOE may ask the applicant to provide additional information on those impacts in order to prepare an environmental critique/synopsis per 10 CFR 1021.216. Note that this pre-award environmental critique/synopsis process would be separate from the preparation of a NEPA document such as an environmental impact statement (EIS) or an environmental assessment (EA). If DOE determines the latter documentation is necessary, this process would need to be completed, funded by and with the participation of the awardee, prior to them taking any action on the proposed project that could have adverse environmental effects or that could limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. The inability to satisfy the NEPA requirements after an award would result in cancellation of the award. Note that in most cases, even where potential impact on the environment exists, preparation of such NEPA documents is rarely necessary, but DOE has the expectation that the Applicant will disclose the potential, which would serve to initiate dialog with DOE if necessary. Should the applicant have any uncertainty, they should "}
