Ayurveda explain this disease under the broad heading of Prameha. It is basically a Kapha dosha disorder with pathological involvement of increased circulating free fatty acids (bahu abaddha meda). Diagnostic approaches to DM in Ayurveda are based on various entities like etiological factors, nature of onset, sequential involvement of different body tissues (dooshya) and even therapeutic varieties. Successful outcome in management of DM depends on chronicity of the illness, association of complications and adherence to specifically advised diet, regimen and exercise. Ayurvedic classics are very particular about dietary management especially of non refined and fiber rich food articles. Medicated gruel (oushadha yavagu) is effectively used for controlling various diseases in Ayurveda. Dashamoola medicated gruel is traditionally practiced in various stages of DM. Dashamoola is a popular combination of 10 herbs specifically indicated in inflammation (swayathu). It has good potential to remove kleda (one of the main pathological element in Prameha) through urine. Nephro, Hepato and Gastrotoxic potential of aqueous extract of Dashamoola has been evaluated and found to be safe by animal experiments. Further some ingredients of Dashamoola have antidiabetic, nephroprotective and cardiotonic effect. As per Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India Dashamoola provide relief from inflammation and its decoction is traditionally practiced by tribal people as anti-inflammatory. There is increasing evidence that low-grade inflammation is closely involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and several drugs with anti-inflammatory properties lower both acutephase reactants and glycemia. As subclinical inflammation is indeed another facet of the IRS, anti-inflammatory treatment may also be beneficial in Diabetes Mellitus. The administration of Dashamoola medicated gruel has shown encouraging results in diabetic patients of freshly diagnosed type 2 DM and even to chronic stages like nephropathy and neuropathy. Case series studies are recorded in routine clinical practice. The full paper review the pathogenesis of Prameha with reference to DM and the role of diet and exercises advised in Ayurveda with special emphasis to case series reports of Dashamoola medicated gruel in various stages of DM.
