This makes it the oldest practised health system in the world. The translation of Ayurveda from Sanskrit means roughly \"knowledge of life\". Two definitions help give an indication of how modern its view of health is. One of these is over 2000 years old and originates from one of the most important fundamental works in Ayurvedic medicine, the Sushruta Samhita: \"A person is deemed to be healthy if their physiology is in equilibrium; with their digestive system and metabolism working well, their tissues and excretory systems functioning normally and their soul, spirit and senses in a state of enduring, inner contentment.\" The other definition comes from the World Health Organisation (WHO): \"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Ayurvedic medicine's holistic approach is also the reason why it has enjoyed such an exemplary position over the last two decades. People from industrialised countries, in particular, are increasingly recognising that this traditional Indian medical system not only cures illnesses but can prevent them too Ultimately: Ayurvedic therapies revitalise body and soul, they enhance well-being and restore strength that has been lost due to people's lifestyles. Why should I choose an Ayurveda treatment? Because you will undergo a holistically designed treatment that will bring balance to your body and soul. Because you will experience at first-hand how the therapies restore your confidence in your own vitality. Because you will discover how the treatments enhance your joie de vivre and give you mental clarity. Because you are worth indulging with something truly precious. "}
