Eric Doerfler, PhD, CRNP", "date": "2017-02-26", "cleaned_text": "Medical Conditions I get calls about how well homeopathic medicine works with various medical problems. I'm happy to answer those in person, but on this page I share my experience with various issues. Problems listed may be broad or narrow in scope, but in all cases, please contact me if you have more in-depth questions. This page is not a substitute for evaluation by a medical professional. It is meant to be an educational guide. Except \"Health Visits\", entries are alphabetical. Health Visits Homeopathic medicine is a subtle, gentle medicine that restores the body's normal regulatory pathways. In ancient times, physicians, like Hippocrates of Kos or Chang Chung-ching of the Chinese Han Dynasty, observed that disease begins as little imbalances. These can magnify over time to become disease as we today would recognize it. Hahnemann argued that suppression of little complaints with medicine can, over time, drive disease deeper. People often seem surprised when they are diagnosed with I welcome health visits. Establishing a baseline case\u2014even if you are \"healthy\"\u2014may identify small imbalances that we can correct. At such a visit a remedy might not be given, as it might not be needed. However, having established care, it enables me to handle acute illnesses or injuries more efficiently. Acute Problems (sore throats, bee stings, etc.) Acute illnesses and injuries respond well to homeopathic medicine. In fact, some of my patients and families practice \"first aid\" type of homeopathic medicine on their own. There are a number of excellent books, CDs/DVDs, and websites for self-prescribing. One can learn to use low-potency remedies for one's family and friends for minor, self-limiting problems. My typical new patient doesn't come in with an acute problem like an injury or pneumonia or something like that. Usually people come in to establish care (health visit) or more commonly to have me help them with a chronic issue. Then, if acute problems like poison ivy or burns or bronchitis come up, we can handily resolve it with a quick office visit or a phone consultation. Even very serious problems such as a bad asthma attack, appendicitis, or kidney infection can be cured with homeopathic medicine. But if homeopathic medicine doesn't work promptly, I will either use regular medicine myself, or refer the patient to a hospital emergency center for regular medical treatment. Abnormal Heart Rhythm There are a lot of different abnormal heart rhythms\u2014or what we call \"arrhythmias\". Some occur because of genetic conditions, alternations in the electrical pathways of the heart occurred at birth. For More common are people with heart disease who have atrial fibrillation. In general, I have not seen homeopathy improve this condition in any but those who present shortly after witnessing a change to this rhythm. If it lasts longer than six months, it must usually be treated with \"blood thinners\", heart drugs, and/or heart catheterization. Since many arrhythmias are \"silent\" conditions with few symptoms, people often don't know they have this for a while. Palpitations, and heart rates that are abnormally slow (<60) or fast (>100) often respond very well to homeopathy (Note: in athletes, a heart rate less than 60 can be quite normal!) Age is a factor; older patients usually don't have a change in rhythm back to normal on homeopathy Alzheimer's Disease/Dementia There is little known about the effectiveness of homeopathy in dementia. It has been treated, and some say successfully. I have had a number of cases of clear dementia, Severe cases of dementia are usually not accessible to homeopaths, but such cases can respond to remedies. As with all such things, the more advanced the disease, and the longer the duration of that severity, the less improvement will occur, as organs and tissues change in response to the disease process. Moreover, in severe mental diseases, close monitoring is a good idea. Unfortunately, homeopathic hospitals do not exist in the United States, and I am unable to provide this level of close observation at this time. Individual consultation can decide whether or not it is worth it to pursue homeopathy for this condition. Anxiety Arthritis There are many forms of arthritis: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and rarer forms such as psoriatic arthritis and other chronic diseases involving joint pain, such as gout. In general, homeopathic medicine helps those who suffer from arthritis pains. I have had many patients with early-diagnosed diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis go on to be essentially disease free. This is a condition in which visual evidence of joint damage determines how much success we'll have in treatment. When the x-rays show a lot of joint erosion and damage, homeopathy will not restore that worn-away cartilage or reform the joint. When people present with a lot of joint The most successful cases present for treatment before Asthma Asthma is a condition in which the air passages in the lungs become inflamed, often swollen, and thus become narrow, making it hard to breathe. In my experience asthma responds very well to homeopathy, both in acute attacks and as a chronic condition. Most patients I see with asthma are already on asthma medication. This can complicate Attention Deficit Disorder/ADHD Attention deficit and hyperactivity are very common problems and very commonly seen in homeopathic practice. My experience with these problems has been very good, and most patients respond well. Many adults and some children present to the clinic already on medication. When this is the case, the children tend to respond better than Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) This is a range of disorders of communication, connection with others, and empathy. According to the Autism Society, it includes a complex of other neurological problems such as learning disabilities, I have treated cases spanning the entire spectrum, from very mild to very severe, and this is what I have found: In general, milder to moderate cases respond fairly well. In fact, I have kids whose teachers and therapists admit that the ASD isn't an issue anymore\u2014what one might call a cure. Children respond better than adults. It seems that like many things, the longer one has the problem, the harder it can be to treat, especially when there is significant tissue change. Research suggests that in many neuropsychiatric conditions, the brain's wiring actually changes. So it makes sense that children, with their younger nervous systems and brains, would have better results. I have also treated severe cases of autism. This is often very troublesome for several reasons. 1) In every Bedwetting/Enuresis Bedwetting can arise from a host of causes, including hormonal imbalances, sleep disturbances, and psychological issues. Homeopathy can usually improve or resolve this problem. Hormonal treatments, such as desmopressin (DDAVP) are effective and fairly safe, but in my view don't get to the root of the imbalance, and like any drug therapy, serious side effects are possible. Behavioral approaches such as \"bladder training\" exercises are not recommended. Alarm therapy can help, although I've seen many cases in which it did not. In general, mainstream treatments are about as effective as homeopathic medicine\u2014and such treatments do not address other, parallel issues such as allergies, sleep problems, etc. Cancer There are two schools of thought regarding the treatment of cancer with homeopathic medicine. The first views existing therapies as The second school of thought is what I was taught by Dr. Paul Herscu of the New England School. This is that cancer \"takes on a life of its own\" and is therefore almost like a new \"person within the person\" with its own peculiarities, symptoms, and energy, making classical homeopathic treatment of Each case is unique, and prospective patients may want to inquire first. Chicken Pox/Shingles Cholesterol Cholesterol is a complex issue. The common notion is that high cholesterol will lead to a heart attack. The truth is not that simple. Today, cholesterol analysis is more complex, with \"good\" cholesterol (HDL) shown to be somewhat protective, and \"bad\" cholesterol (LDL) shown to put people at higher risk for heart disease, but the levels of cholesterol that matter also depend on other risk factors such as smoking or high blood pressure, as well as family history. I still meet patients whose doctors put them on cholesterol medicine for a total cholesterol over 200 alone. I believe it is important to carefully assess a patient's history and risk factors before deciding that lowering cholesterol with a drug is indicated. At this time \"statins\"\u2014drugs like Lipitor\u2014are undergoing intensive study, as many researchers believe that they might be a sort of \"fountain of youth\", so many benefits have been attributed to their use! It remains to be seen whether or not these drugs will prove to be so beneficial. Furthermore, liver and muscle irritation are not uncommon side Can classical homeopathic medicine help? In those people without severe dietary problems or highly genetically-related elevations in cholesterol, it seems to improve overall health more than it lowers cholesterol itself. In my practice, patients with this issue benefit from dietary review, a homeopathic remedy prescribed on the entirety of their case, and if necessary the use of herbs, Cold Sores/Canker Sores, and Herpes Cold sores and canker sores are related to herpes-type viruses. \"Herpes\" includes more than just the sexually transmitted Concussions and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) TBI can occur from any head injury, or even from a severe health event affecting the brain, such as a stroke or meningitis. In general, Depression Depression responds very well to homeopathic treatment. Many patients come in already on antidepressant medication, and a small percentage of those people will need to continue them long term. However many patients can come off their medications in time. Even those with fairly severe depression will likely benefit, and a few may be able to discontinue medications entirely. Mild to moderate depression has a higher rate of success, with medication discontinuation a real possibility. In some Diabetes In general, homeopathic medicine cannot \"cure\" diabetes, although it can make management of it more predictable and easier to control, as we rebalance the body's regulatory systems. Juvenile onset (type 1) and gene-related diabetes display the least sensitivity to homeopathic management, although it may improve the general health of diabetics. In adult-onset diabetes (type 2), homeopathic medicine does improve blood sugar control. In those people with \"borderline\" diabetes, it may even forestall the need for medications, if treated early enough. In typical cases of several years duration, expect better health overall, but the need for medication is likely to continue. In cases where diabetes has already caused ravages such as amputation, partial blindness, or erectile dysfunction, homeopathy may moderate further damage but cannot undo significant changes in the tissues due to prolonged high blood sugars. There may be some other things that can be done to improve existing complications of diabetes. Dizziness Dizziness covers a range of complaints. For some people \"dizziness\" is really faintness or lightheadedness (see both \"Abnormal heart rhythm\" and \"Heart disease\" in this section). For In general, dizziness responds very well to homeopathic treatment. In more serious cases in which brain or nerve pathology are involved, it can be helpful in conjunction with regular medical treatment to relieve discomfort. Evaluation of dizziness requires a careful neurological examination and in some cases imaging studies, such as MRI. Eczema & Other Skin Rashes Eczema is a kind of allergic reaction of the skin and may be acute or chronic. Often it occurs in families, and also there is often a personal or family history of allergies and asthma. Other types of skin rashes include drug reactions/drug rashes, acne, psoriasis, blistering, fungal infections, and a host of others, including those associated with systemic diseases such as lupus or celiac disease. Skin rashes are a common problem in my practice, and often the main complaint. In homeopathic Dynamic rashes such as eczema, psoriasis, acne and a host of other common problems respond well to homeopathic medicine. The downside is that because homeopathy heals \"from the inside out\" sometimes the rash may resolve after other matters improve. For Acne is a normal effect of puberty, and so young people should expect that homeopathic medicine won't cure all their acne 100% of the time. Endometriosis/Menstrual pain All sorts of menstrual problems are highly responsive to homeopathic treatment. Endometriosis is a specific type of menstrual problem in which the tissue lining the uterus begins to grow freely in the abdominal tissues. It is also significantly improved with homeopathic remedies. Treatment of menstrual problems may be complicated by medications, birth control pills or injections, or surgery such as ablation. However even these cases, while more complex to treat, still improve. Menstrual problems require Gluten Intolerance and Celiac Disease Gluten intolerance (GI) and celiac disease are two different things. The former is more of an allergic type of problem, and the latter reflects an autoimmune process in which the body attacks its own digestive tract because of a genetic sensitivity to gluten, a protein found in wheat and similar grains. In general people with GI have other digestive problems, like irritable bowel syndrome, or other allergies. I have found that treating people with GI with homeopathy helps some. They do develop some ability to tolerate gluten. Those with celiac disease usually don't, even when their other symptoms or problems improve on homeopathic medicine. Headaches/Migraines Headaches have many different causes and come in many different types, with migraine headaches being only one category of headache type. Tension headaches, sinus headaches, and similar non-migraine headaches are highly Heart Disease There are many different types of heart disease, although the most common problem we tend to associate this term with is coronary artery disease (CAD), or \"heart attack.\" Although heart attacks were once treated with homeopathy alone, that was a long time ago, before modern medical approaches were developed. Today we use homeopathy, as well as herbal medicine, nutrition, and exercise, together with regular medicine to improve overall health in CAD. Other types of heart disease include heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and valve disease. Here again homeopathic medicine serves a complementary role with regular medicine. There are a number of dietary and herbal approaches that also support recovery in heart disease, and may reduce the chance of heart disease recurring. High blood pressure Since homeopathic medicine was developed in the 19th century, there is little written about treating it-after all, doctors then didn't really see it as a \"disease\" as such. I have found that the most effective treatments for high blood pressure are a healthy diet and regular exercise. Many of the herbals and nutritional treatments touted on the internet don't work very well. I have found that homeopathic remedies can work if the patient has never been medicated for the problem. Those people who have been medicated for more than a few months never respond to homeopathy alone, although I have found their blood pressures to be easier to control. I have found a few people who treated themselves with herbs for high blood pressure, and the results-at least in my office-run from ineffective to toxic. Interestingly, many people end up taking dozens of supplement pills when a single blood pressure medication would do. Although I'm not an advocate of pharmaceutical treatments, there are cases in which it makes more sense to use a mild drug. Selection of blood pressure medicine is more important than once thought. I often advise additional, inexpensive testing to refine our selection of our initial treatment. I find it remarkable that in many practices this easy step is usually not done. Hormonal Imbalances, Female Homeopathy is essentially a medicine of regulation. That means that the role of homeopathy is to help the system reregulate itself so that things work properly. In terms of In homeopathic medicine, the idea is to simply give the remedy and let the system decide what small hormonal adjustments are needed to restore health. In my The use of hormones for birth control is another matter which I discuss individually with each woman. At this time, I do not prescribe \"custom-compounded\" formulations of bio-identical Hormonal Imbalances, Male Hormone imbalances can occur in Erectile dysfunction is rarely a hormone problem. More often it is caused by nerve or blood vessel disease, mostly commonly caused by diabetes or heart disease. While natural medicine can help, I usually find that drugs like sildenafil (\"Viagra\") are most useful, as the damage has already been done. Incontinence This condition has such a variety of causes that it isn't possible to detail every type here. Homeopathy can be effective in some types of urinary leakage, especially when there isn't too much surgical damage or repeated attempts at surgical repair. Irritable Bowel Syndrome IBS is a term that actually describes a variety of digestive disturbances that lead to abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or both. We don't really have a solid understanding of what IBS is, but in homeopathic Irritable Bowel Disease/Crohn's Disease Inflammatory bowel diseases can be treated homeopathically. As with other types of conditions, the more advanced the disease is, the harder it is to treat, and it takes longer to get the system to respond to homeopathy. Many people will get better, a few may be entirely There are a number of herbal, nutritional, and mind-body approaches that are also very useful in IBD in particular. IBD is a fairly advanced inflammatory disease, and therefore it helps to use multiple approaches to get it under control. Lupus This is As with other types of serious conditions, the more advanced the disease the less robust the response to homeopathic medical approaches. In other words, most people will get better, a few may be entirely Lyme Disease/Post-Lyme Treatment Syndrome The subject of Lyme disease is well-discussed on the internet and in the regular media. The use of antibiotics to treat LD is well known. One controversy I often hear about is that between mainstream doctors-who follow the Infectious Disease Society of America's antibiotic treatment recommendations-and so-called \"Lyme doctors\" and their view that those recommendations are not adequate. For my \"regulars\", people who see me for routine care, I just treat with a homeopathic remedy and the usual antibiotic, according to the IDSA recommendations. The other type of patient I see is the person with longstanding LD, who has usually had many courses of antibiotics. These people are still ill. The question is, why? These people are dismissed by regular doctors as anxious or depressed or seeking attention. They are subjected by Lyme doctors to increasingly lengthy, toxic, and expensive courses of antibiotics. Although I have no doubt some people feel better afterward, I have observed that a lot of them don't. The scientific research shows clearly that late-stage LD doesn't do especially well on such rigorous antibiotic treatment. Patients and doctors try to explain away their failure to improve by talking about coinfections like babesiosis and other parasites. Methicillin-Resistant Staph Infection (MRSA) \" In the last decade, MRSA has gone from a mostly hospital-acquired condition affecting ill hospitalized patients, to a community-acquired infection that affects some people outside the hospital. Mostly, it is a skin infection. Typically I see patients who have had several\u2014unsuccessful\u2014courses of antibiotics. The infections keep coming back. Reregulation of the immune system using a well-selected homeopathic remedy usually ends the cycle. Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) Like ADD/ADHD and other functional behavior disorders, ODD behaviors respond very well to homeopathy. A condition of children, ODD is not just stubbornness or an eccentricity. Rather it is a kind of rage that actually harms the child who suffers from it. Often the behaviors are accompanied by violence, sometimes very bad violence. Usually, in my practice, I do not diagnose this; it is usually diagnosed by a pediatrician or child therapist, and the parents bring the child to me as an alternative to medication, or as an additional approach to behavior modification programs. Sometimes \"behavior-mod\" is successful. The children I see have usually failed this approach or have not responded to it adequately. They usually improve on homeopathy. Osteoporosis Some evidence exists for the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment for osteoporosis. Although there is some genetic influence on bone health, it may be that genetic tendencies can be modified. In general bone loss can be stopped or reduced, and in some Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, Ataxias and Tremor Neurological conditions that cause tremors and other movement disorders require remedies as varied as there are individuals. Responses are as varied as well. In general, Pervasive Developmental Disorders There is a lot of controversy about PDD. Most homeopathic authorities agree: carefully individualized, classical treatment appears to be most effective. Very severe cases can improve. Plus, such children usually have extensive learning support, psychiatric care, and various therapies. The vast majority of cases are not so Pregnancy & Problems in Pregnancy I love treating pregnant patients...because in most problems of pregnancy, most doctors decline to use medication because of fear of birth defects and so forth. This leaves women to suffer through until the pregnancy is over. The most common problems I see in pregnant women are nausea and vomiting, and headaches. There is no contraindication to the use of homeopathic remedies in pregnancy because homeopathic remedies do not act like drugs. They can't cause birth defects. If a woman is having symptoms in pregnancy and wants to try to get some relief beyond taking Tylenol, homeopathy is worth considering. In rare cases, a threatened miscarriage is the complaint. Sometimes there have been several previous miscarriages. In either Seizures/Epilepsy Seizures tend to respond very well to homeopathic remedies. Mild to moderate seizures and repeated fever-related seizures in children respond well. A single fever seizure in a child is usually a one-time event, and not likely to need further treatment. Repeated high fevers leading to seizures in a child would be a good thing to treat. Sometimes young people or adults have single seizure episodes. In cases like these, treating homeopathically is a good idea, if simply to reduce the chance of it happening again. In those people who have diagnosed epilepsy, homeopathy can reduce the need for medication or eliminate it altogether. This usually depends on how long the person has been medicated, and how heavily. Seizures caused by tumors or other brain problems can be treated by a combination of homeopathic and regular medicine and surgery. Seizures caused by specific genetic disorders known to cause severe, frequent seizures will respond to homeopathy, but only partially. Examples include Dravet's Syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and others. My aim is to reduce the frequency and intensity of Schizophrenia and Severe Mental Health Disorders Schizophrenia is a disorder or sensation and mood, marked by distorted thinking, abnormal sensory processing (such as hallucinations or hearing voices) that results in impaired behavior. It runs in families but is not dependent on a family history or specific gene. It is not \"split personality\" as is often thought in popular fiction. Schizophrenic disorders are Stroke Stokes are caused by blood clots in the brain (most common) or bleeding into the brain from some damaged blood vessel or other vessel abnormality like an aneurysm (less common). Homeopathic medicines can be used to treat strokes in an emergency, but today this is not Substance Abuse I have found that treating substance abuse with homeopathic medicine may lead to lessened I take a \"harm reduction\" approach in managing substance abuse. None is best, but less is better than a lot. In the United States, abstinence is considered the only legitimate treatment for substance abuse. In Europe and elsewhere, the medical view is more nuanced. Some people may benefit most from modified behavior to minimize substance use at safe levels. Whether abstinence or harm-reduced use is more appropriate depends on the patient as an individual. Homeopathic treatment is most effective when the patient is fully in engaged in treatments that support sobriety or Thyroid Problems Homeopathy is generally fairly effective in stopping hyperthyroid disease or \"overactive\" thyroid. It is important to make sure that the overactivity isn't caused by Underactive thyroid generally does not respond to homeopathy, unless the Tics/Tourette's Syndrome The involuntary tics and speech problems that occur with Tourette's Syndrome and similar disorders do respond to homeopathy. Selecting the correct remedy can be difficult, but Tinnitus & Hearing Loss Hearing loss can occur for a variety of reasons. Tinnitus is specific for a set of noises such as ringing, rushing or pulsating sounds in the ears. It is important to eliminate easily-treated causes of hearing problems, such as excessive wax. Once such causes are eliminated, homeopathy might help. Persistent ringing in the ears, that has been a problem for a long time, especially whenever the person's tinnitus is due to exposure to loud noise for long periods, is usually unresponsive to homeopathy. If the tinnitus is more related to chronic inflammation it is more responsive to homeopathic medicine. Urinary Tract Infections/Chronic or Recurrent Cystitis Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, especially in women, and can usually be as easily treated with antibiotics as with homeopathic remedies. In my experience, two types of conditions are more ideally treated with homeopathy. The first is repeated UTIs, especially when there is no surgical problem, such as a twisted urinary pathway, and no hygiene problem (this is usually addressed as part of the teaching whenever we treat anyone with a UTI). Whenever repeated UTIs occur for no apparent reason, homeopathy can usually restore an improved resistance to further infections. The second case is when the \"UTI\" isn't an infection at all. This is usually discovered after repeated \"infection\" symptoms yield negative laboratory proof of infection, or when multiple courses of antibiotics don't help. Other problems can seem like a UTI, and these include overactive bladder, problems of weakness in the bladder structure or muscles (often hormonal), or inflammation of the bladder or urinary pathways without any infection, so-called \"interstitial cystitis\". These problems almost always improve with a well-selected remedy. Sometimes herbal medicines can be used as well to provide support and rebalance the system. Occasionally, a patient will have had some surgery to correct a \"prolapse\" or fallen organs like the uterus or bladder. Sometimes homeopathy will improve these patients as well. For acute UTIs, I will treat with antibiotics, if desired. In severe urinary tract infections and kidney infections, I strongly recommend both homeopathy and antibiotics. Vaccination Some homeopaths practice a form of \"homeopathic vaccination\". At this time, I do not do this, as the evidence for its effectiveness is fairly weak. In general, I have found that people who are doing well and getting healthier on a homeopathic treatment are also more resistant to infectious diseases. Some homeopaths (and other practitioners of \"natural\" medicine) teach that vaccination is bad. Elsewhere on my website is an article in which I detail my thoughts on vaccination. I should point out that the problems with vaccination are somewhat theoretical at this time, and the evidence tends to suggest that most people will not have catastrophic side effects from vaccines. This doesn't mean that I think vaccines never cause severe problems. In The U.S. vaccinates very heavily, often for diseases that tend to have low fatality At this time I neither advocate for nor advise against vaccination. It is the responsibility of public health authorities to advise the general public. It is my responsibility to advise individual patients. I provide advice on vaccination choices based on each individual's health profile. Warts These respond to homeopathy very well. A related condition, molluscum, also clears up on homeopathic remedies. Both conditions can clear up on their own. Warts will respond to medicines like Aldara or to freezing removal or to surgical removal\u2014but they often come back. With "}
