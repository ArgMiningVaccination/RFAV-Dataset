According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated [30.3 million](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/data/statistics/statistics-report.html) [diabetes](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/diabetes/). In modern-day China, people often use [acupuncture](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/156488.php) to treat diabetes. Scientists who are currently researching the benefits of acupuncture for diabetes [note that](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6283081/) - improve blood glucose management - help with weight loss - protect pancreas islet function, which is responsible for [insulin](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/diabetes/whatisinsulin.php)production - improve [insulin resistance](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/305567.php) - adjust the balance of hormones that affect diabetes, for example, melatonin, insulin, glucocorticold, and epinephrine In recent years, scientists [have been looking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5490211/) [prediabetes](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311240) to become an effective treatment. A number of studies have indicated that acupuncture may offer benefits for people with diabetes. Glucose and insulin levels In 2018, researchers in China published [findings](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1136/acupmed-2016-011131) that showed how specific acupuncture points help improve symptoms of diabetes in rats with diabetes. They found that within 3 weeks, the rats that received electroacupuncture had: - lower glucose levels - increased insulin levels - improved glucose tolerance Insulin sensitivity and resistance A 2016 literature review of human and animal studies in the journal, [Acupuncture in Medicine](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1136/acupmed-2016-011074) looked into whether acupuncture: - was a valid treatment for insulin resistance - could be suitable as a future treatment for [insulin sensitivity](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323027) The results suggested that low-intensity and low-frequency electroacupuncture could help in reducing insulin resistance and increasing insulin sensitivity. The researchers suggested that people could either use electroacupuncture alone or with other treatments. Possible alternative therapies include dietary measures and Chinese herbs. Acupuncture and metformin In 2015, an article published in [Acupuncture in Medicine](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1136/acupmed-2014-010724) reviewed studies using rats in which scientists combined electroacupuncture with the anti-diabetic medication, metformin. They were looking for better glucose lowering responses and greater insulin sensitivity. The team found that, compared with metformin alone, this combination offered: - better glucose lowering effects - greater insulin sensitivity None of the studies appear to address the processes and mechanisms that may explain how exactly acupuncture works to manage diabetes symptoms. RECALL OF METFORMIN EXTENDED RELEASE In May 2020, the recommended that some makers of metformin extended release remove some of their tablets from the U.S. market. This is because an unacceptable level of a probable carcinogen (cancer-causing agent) was found in some extended-release metformin tablets. If you currently take this drug, call your healthcare provider. They will advise whether you should continue to take your medication or if you need a new prescription. [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] Acupuncture techniques for treating diabetes might be different from those for treating pain. Medical acupuncture involves many different styles and techniques, but, for the purposes of treating diabetes, there appears to be research for only three of these. Wrist-Ankle Wrist-ankle treatment is a form of acupuncture that involves deep needle stimulation of the ankle and wrist nerves. In 2014, research published in [Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2014/261709/) concluded that wrist-ankle acupuncture treatment may be a safe and effective procedure for treating pain, including diabetic peripheral neuritis. However, the scientists added that not there is not yet enough evidence to confirm that this method is safe and effective. Electroacupuncture Electroacupuncture is the most common type of acupuncture that practitioners used to treat diabetes. The acupuncturist inserts a pair of needles in each acupuncture point and passes an electrical impulse from one needle to the other. This treatment appears to be effective in: - treating pain from [diabetic neuropathy](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/245310.php) - managing blood glucose levels Herbal acupuncture Herbal acupuncture involves injecting herbs into acupuncture points. This is a modern technique. According to one review from the journal [Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5450520/) [type 2 diabetes](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/diabetes/type2diabetes.php). Anyone considering acupuncture should be aware of some general side effects. These include the possibility of: - soreness - bleeding - bruising Before having acupuncture, a person should check that: - The needles are sterile and for a single use only. - The acupuncturist has a license to practice. Many traditional Chinese medical doctors are also MDs in the U.S., practicing both approaches to health but people should always check their credentials. - It is safe for them to have acupuncture treatment. Sometimes, a doctor may discourage a person who is taking blood thinners or has a blood clotting disease from having acupuncture. Acupuncture can be a safe and effective treatment, as long as a licensed and experienced practitioner performs it. It has become more widely accepted in western medicine over the past 20 years. People can combine it with other types of diabetes treatment, including medication, a healthful diet, and regular exercise. However, acupuncture can be expensive, and a person cannot be sure that it will be beneficial for type 2 diabetes. Q: I have just had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and I have to use diet and exercise to control it. Is it worthwhile paying for acupuncture? Will it give me a better chance of keeping healthy? A: Acupuncture from a licensed practitioner is safe, but it is not clear that it is worthwhile. This would be a personal decision. Some studies show there may be positive results, but there is no clear indication that acupuncture will improve the condition of type 2 diabetes. The best chance of staying healthy is to exercise, follow a recommended diet, and follow your doctor's advice. "}
