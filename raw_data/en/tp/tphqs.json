Its history dates back as far as 2,500 years. It involves a series of slow, meditative body movements that were originally designed for self-defense and to promote inner peace and calm. As in Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tai Chi helps the body's Qi to flow in balance. When the flow of Qi is smooth and balanced, good health is achieved and our body can be free of disease. There are various forms of Tai Chi, notably the Yang, Wu and Chen style. No matter what style is practiced, they all are conducted slowly, deliberately, and gracefully, with each movement flowing seamlessly into the next without hesitation. Benefits of regular practice of Tai Chi include: Improve balance and prevention of fall Decrease in pain, fatigue and stiffness Increase strength and endurance Improve aerobic capacity Reduce stress Improve psychological health Adjunct to cognitive behavioral therapy In Taiwan, Tai Chi is being adopted by the Taipei Education Department as part of an optional fitness curriculum, particularly for asthmatic school children.
