Like other forms of energy healing, Crystal therapy works by improving the energy flow in the body and releases blockages and stagnation within the [chakras](https://www.theyoganomads.com/12-chakras-system/). For centuries, crystals have been used to reduce inflammation and pain, among other things. It is said that every crystal has unique healing powers due to its specific mineral and element composition. Placing a crystal on your body or close to you prompts the stone's vibrations to interact with your energy field, stimulating the healing process. However, note that crystal healing is one of the alternative therapies without scientific evidence to prove its effectiveness. Instead, researchers believe if crystals do work, it is down to the placebo effect (AKA having the belief that the gemstone you are working with can relieve pain). Top 12 Crystals for Pain Relief As crystals are said to have unique healing properties, the best gemstone for you will depend on the type of pain relief you seek. Here are the best crystals for muscle cramps, joint pain, arthritis, and more.

This has an incredibly soothing effect, easing muscle aches and cramps. Aventurine is also known to detoxify the organs and improve heart health due to its link with the [heart chakra](https://www.theyoganomads.com/heart-chakra/). To use a green aventurine stone for muscular pain relief, place it on the painful area for 5 to 10 minutes as you practice deep breathing and connect to the healing energy of aventurine. You can also add this crystal to a mineral salt bath to reduce muscle soreness.

This crystal is known to aid in healing joint pain and weak bones due to its ability to nourish and strengthen the body's structural elements and improve calcium absorption. Because of this, blue apatite is believed to be good for osteoarthritis, postural problems, and spinal injuries. It has also been used to ease children's teething problems and growing pains. If you are dealing with a joint or bone injury, you can directly place a [blue apatite stone](https://www.amazon.com/rockcloud-Natural-Tumbling-Lapidary-Polishing/dp/B07S6T3JKY/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=36M42P9BO5VKK&keywords=Blue+Apatite&qid=1686189232&sprefix=green+aventurine%2Caps%2C368&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE5QlBPWDM5QjZFM1cmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAxMzgxNTUyT1JaWTNIMVJQWkRFJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA1NTg0MjIxVVo0S0w5SE9DMUU3JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==&tag=theyoganomads-20) on the problem area.

Specifically, amethyst is one of the best crystals for pain relief because it instantly relieves tension headaches and migraines. This is due to its association with the third eye and [crown chakra](https://www.theyoganomads.com/purple-chakra/) - amethyst clears blocked or negative energy in the head, promoting mental clarity and peace of mind. Amethyst is also a powerful crystal for easing EMF symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, uncomfortable rashes, and muscle pain and aches. To use amethyst to relieve mental tension, place a [raw cluster stone](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Amethyst-Crystal-Clusters-Uruguay/dp/B08794LBXY/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=U71HTJPY424Z&keywords=Amethyst&qid=1686189299&sprefix=blue%2Bapatite%2Caps%2C367&sr=8-1-spons&smid=A3J1U0ZTT6Y96Q&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExOTVQMjBVRE01RjM3JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjY3MjE5MVVRU0ZHUUZXMTJFSCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTgyMzgzMzFaMjg5UU9ZOEo4ViZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&th=1&tag=theyoganomads-20) next to your bed as you rest or sleep. Make the room as dark and quiet as possible, and consider diffusing or inhaling [peppermint essential oil](https://www.amazon.com/Brooklyn-Botany-Peppermint-Essential-Oil/dp/B088SYMZGG/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1BLV7DYB6512S&keywords=peppermint+oil&qid=1686818250&sprefix=pepperm%2Caps%2C501&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1&tag=theyoganomads-20).

Clear quartz cleanses and unblocks the [entire chakra system](https://www.theyoganomads.com/chakras/) and raises your vibration, healing pain on an energetic and spiritual level.

As crystal healing is not instant, I recommend repeating this process daily until you notice an improvement. In addition to chronic pain, clear quartz can relieve stress and lower high blood pressure. Meditating with a [raw clear quartz stone](https://www.amazon.com/LAIDANLA-Crystals-1-5-2inch-Gemstones-Decoration/dp/B0B2ZYLG3X/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Clear+Quartz&qid=1686818704&sr=8-3&tag=theyoganomads-20) during high-stress situations can bring you instant calm and clarity and even change your perspective of the situation.

It also soothes sore throats, eases PMS symptoms, and rebalances the thyroid. In addition, lapis lazuli's anti-inflammatory properties boost the immune system and improve the functioning of the respiratory system.

These healing qualities make black tourmaline one of the best crystals for rheumatoid arthritis and chronic pain relief. Plus, as black tourmaline cleanses and balances the lower [chakras](https://www.theyoganomads.com/integrate-chakras-yoga-class/), it promotes healthy blood flow and improves the functioning of the reproductive and elimination organs. Thus, this stone can help ease the pain associated with urinary infections and constipation. Keeping a [raw black tourmaline stone](https://www.amazon.com/Dancing-Bear-Black-Tourmaline-Crystals/dp/B082LNY95M/ref=sr_1_5?crid=5FGZK9FN9AFX&keywords=Black+Tourmaline&qid=1686189359&sprefix=lapis+lazuli%2Caps%2C368&sr=8-5&tag=theyoganomads-20) next to your bed will allow the crystal to protect your aura from negative energy and draw out toxins while you sleep. It can also prevent you from absorbing harmful EMF radiation from your tech devices or household appliances. [Rose Quartz](https://www.amazon.com/MAIBAOTA-Healing-Crystals-Gemstone-Meditation/dp/B09DJFV18L/ref=sr_1_6?crid=3H139SO89LGIJ&keywords=Rose+Quartz&qid=1686189381&sprefix=black+tourmaline%2Caps%2C378&sr=8-6&tag=theyoganomads-20) - For Heart Health Issues & Emotional Pain Rose Quartz is a popular [heart chakra stone](https://www.theyoganomads.com/heart-chakra-crystals/) known for its emotional healing properties. Thus, [rose quartz](https://www.theyoganomads.com/rose-quartz-stone/) is ideal for lessening the emotional response to chronic pain. This soothing [crystal will help you find compassion and love](https://www.theyoganomads.com/crystals-for-love/) for yourself amidst physical pain while keeping your emotions under control. Rose quartz is also known to improve heart health; it can lower high blood pressure, ease chest pain, and improve blood circulation. For physical issues like these, lay down and place a [rose quartz palm stone](https://www.amazon.com/MAIBAOTA-Healing-Crystals-Gemstone-Meditation/dp/B09DJFV18L/ref=sr_1_6?crid=3H139SO89LGIJ&keywords=Rose+Quartz&qid=1686189381&sprefix=black+tourmaline%2Caps%2C378&sr=8-6&tag=theyoganomads-20) on your chest. Listen to [heart chakra frequency music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3Ys6epmZE) or follow a guided Yoga Nidra to stimulate the healing prompt. If using rose quartz for emotional healing, wearing a [crystal necklace](https://www.amazon.com/Necklace-Healing-Crystal-Necklaces-Crystals/dp/B09VYS9S39/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3RZTVA7338DZK&keywords=Rose+Quartz+necklace&qid=1686821981&sprefix=rose+quartz+nec%2Caps%2C523&sr=8-3&tag=theyoganomads-20) is most beneficial as it keeps the stone close to your heart chakra and in contact with your skin. [Smoky Quartz](https://www.amazon.com/Runyangshi-Natural-Healing-Crystal-Faceted/dp/B089KHR58T/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Smoky+Quartz&qid=1686189405&sr=8-1&tag=theyoganomads-20) - For Lower Body Pain The smokey quartz crystal has linked to the root chakra and [sacral chakra](https://www.theyoganomads.com/sacral-chakra/). Thus, it can aid pain in the lower body, including the legs, hips, and lower abdomen. It also reduces discomfort in the digestive tract, dissolves PMS cramps, and can control chronic back pain by strengthening the lumbar spine muscles. Smoky quartz works similarly to black tourmaline, drawing out negative energy from the physical body and absorbing it into itself. Point this smokey quartz [healing wand](https://www.amazon.com/Runyangshi-Natural-Healing-Crystal-Faceted/dp/B089KHR58T/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Smoky+Quartz&qid=1686189405&sr=8-1&tag=theyoganomads-20) at the affected area as you breathe deeply and envision toxins, pain, and negative energy leaving your body.

Linked to the moon's energy, it balances bodily fluids, healing digestive pain from diarrhea, constipation, and IBS. On another level, the moonstone balances the hormones, promoting emotional stability so that you feel calm, centered, and pain-free. I love using this stone in my yoga practice to ease menstrual pain. I recommend placing a [moonstone worry stone](https://www.amazon.com/Fekuar-Natural-Moonstone-Teardrop-Meditation/dp/B08C9KN2C2/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3NQ0M2QGYSA1W&keywords=Moonstone&qid=1686189424&sprefix=smoky%2Bquartz%2Caps%2C497&sr=8-2&th=1&tag=theyoganomads-20) on your sacral chakra (lower belly) during the savasana pose or on your lower back in [the child's pose](https://www.theyoganomads.com/childs-pose/) for instant pain relief. [Aquamarine](https://www.amazon.com/Aquamarine-Palm-Stone-Massage-Balancing/dp/B08L6KGSS8/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2SLUR10ZVR76H&keywords=Aquamarine&qid=1686189440&sprefix=moonstone%2Caps%2C385&sr=8-3&tag=theyoganomads-20) - For Easing Inflammation & Congestion The calming, cooling stone aquamarine is known for easing inflammation and improving the functioning of the nervous system. In addition, as a [throat chakra](https://www.theyoganomads.com/throat-chakra/) stone, it is particularly beneficial for throat pain and respiratory health. Thus, this is my go-to crystal for getting over colds, flu, and upper respiratory viruses. It soothes restriction in the throat and congestion in the nasal passages so that you can breathe easily. Place this soft [aquamarine palm stone](https://www.amazon.com/Aquamarine-Palm-Stone-Massage-Balancing/dp/B08L6KGSS8/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2SLUR10ZVR76H&keywords=Aquamarine&qid=1686189440&sprefix=moonstone%2Caps%2C385&sr=8-3&tag=theyoganomads-20) over your throat (for sore throats) or third eye (for nasal congestion) while visualizing the blockages breaking up and the toxins leaving your body. You can also add it to a relaxing bath or take it to the sauna. [Selenite](https://www.amazon.com/MINERALUNIVERSE-Natural-Selenite-Crystal-Stone/dp/B07VYPQ4WB/ref=sr_1_10?crid=3CW0NFVYGDOGZ&keywords=Selenite&qid=1686189458&sprefix=aquamarine%2Caps%2C381&sr=8-10&tag=theyoganomads-20) - For General Muscle Soreness Selenite is ideal for general muscle soreness, whether from an intense gym workout or standing on your feet for too long. This is because it is made from a salt known as calcium sulfate dihydrate, so it works similarly to Epsom salts. Thus, I recommend adding a few [selenite stones](https://www.amazon.com/MINERALUNIVERSE-Natural-Selenite-Crystal-Stone/dp/B07VYPQ4WB/ref=sr_1_10?crid=3CW0NFVYGDOGZ&keywords=Selenite&qid=1686189458&sprefix=aquamarine%2Caps%2C381&sr=8-10&tag=theyoganomads-20) to a mineral bath. As selenite is a high vibrational stone full of positive energy, it is also known to boost the [healing of any ailment by strengthening and encouraging the body's innate healing powers](https://www.theyoganomads.com/red-agate/). [Malachite](https://www.amazon.com/KALIFANO-Tumbled-Malachite-Bundle-Protection/dp/B08ZDWYX3Z/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1QASQHQ0JWXIX&keywords=Malachite&qid=1686189490&sprefix=selenite%2Caps%2C415&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFZSkk4OURHOVo5Q0omZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA5Njg5MDkyR0Q0TlBBWkNBWEdZJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA3NDk3MTgyRkhSMVpPR0lUSlJMJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==&tag=theyoganomads-20) - For Boosting The Immune System Grab a green malachite stone if you've been getting sick lately. Malachite enhances life force energy and boosts immunity to help you get back to top health after an illness or injury. Simply place several [malachite crystals](https://www.amazon.com/KALIFANO-Tumbled-Malachite-Bundle-Protection/dp/B08ZDWYX3Z/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1QASQHQ0JWXIX&keywords=Malachite&qid=1686189490&sprefix=selenite%2Caps%2C415&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFZSkk4OURHOVo5Q0omZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA5Njg5MDkyR0Q0TlBBWkNBWEdZJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA3NDk3MTgyRkhSMVpPR0lUSlJMJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==&tag=theyoganomads-20) around the home to promote good health. In addition to physical healing, malachite improves our spiritual health by bringing the chakra system into balance and healing emotional pain. Other Natural Remedies For Pain Relief Aside from [crystal healing](https://www.theyoganomads.com/crystals-for-health/), there are various other traditional natural remedies for pain relief. Some of these remedies perfectly complement crystal therapy, so I recommend using them with your favorite crystals for pain relief. Essential Oils Like crystals, there are various essential oils associated with pain relief. For example, according to Traditional Chinese Medicine, [ginger oil](https://www.amazon.com/Swelling-Massage-Therapeutic-Essential-HIQILI/dp/B08ZLJSWRF/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=ginger+oil&qid=1686824736&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1&smid=A1DO8324LDL8FO&tag=theyoganomads-20) can warm up muscles to reduce pain and cramps while increasing blood flow to speed up healing. Peppermint oil is another excellent essential oil, believed to help a wide array of physical pain, such as muscle tension, joint pain, and neurological disorders like carpal tunnel syndrome. It is also beneficial in relieving headaches and migraines. Finally, [lavender oil](https://www.amazon.com/Handcraft-Lavender-Essential-Oil-Therapeutic/dp/B075817VBP/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1UF6CZO3RCW5D&keywords=lavender+oil&qid=1686825011&sprefix=ginger+oil%2Caps%2C364&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1&smid=A2KJ38C2ZIB8X9&tag=theyoganomads-20) has a relaxing effect on the mind and body, reducing swelling and inflammation. Plus, lavender is well known for its sedative nature, helping you drift off to sleep quickly, even when dealing with chronic conditions. You can combine essential oils with healing crystals in various ways, like: - Placing the stone under your pillow and adding a few drops of oil to the pillowcase - Diffusing the oil as you meditate or [practice yoga](https://www.theyoganomads.com/incorporate-essential-oils-into-your-yoga-classes/)with a crystal - Adding both crystal and oil to a mineral bath Massage While crystals and essential oils may not have enough scientific research to support the claims that they help with pain relief, massage does. One [study](https://www.health.harvard.edu/alternative-and-integrative-health/therapeutic-massage-for-pain-relief) published in Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice found that therapeutic hand massage significantly reduced hand pain. Meanwhile, a separate study found that 2-3 weekly therapeutic massage sessions can relieve chronic neck pain. Many massage tools are made from healing crystals, allowing you to combine the powers of crystal healing and [massage](https://www.theyoganomads.com/chakra-massage/). For example, you can use these [rose quartz](https://www.amazon.com/Domika-Natural-Acupuncture-Tretament-Scraping/dp/B09QKTH5F9/ref=dp_prsubs_sccl_1/138-3034813-7744460?pd_rd_w=aX1nX&content-id=amzn1.sym.e96c3ffa-bb6e-40b4-9d09-12a045e9ab48&pf_rd_p=e96c3ffa-bb6e-40b4-9d09-12a045e9ab48&pf_rd_r=BYK01XBE40QGMQJEWMFD&pd_rd_wg=rlyMJ&pd_rd_r=181af0de-57fd-4b36-b614-891ec52ce459&pd_rd_i=B09QKTH5F9&psc=1&tag=theyoganomads-20) and [clear quartz](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K1BJ2ZL/ref=sspa_dk_detail_1?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B07K1BJ2ZL&pd_rd_w=WCyku&content-id=amzn1.sym.eb7c1ac5-7c51-4df5-ba34-ca810f1f119a&pf_rd_p=eb7c1ac5-7c51-4df5-ba34-ca810f1f119a&pf_rd_r=BYK01XBE40QGMQJEWMFD&pd_rd_wg=KRFZb&pd_rd_r=729474e5-10d4-4865-8ae6-531f812ae535&s=hpc&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWw&tag=theyoganomads-20) massage pointed sticks to relieve pain in specific areas of the body.
