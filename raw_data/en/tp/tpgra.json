CSL Seqirus [announced](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/csl-seqirus-announces-third-us-government-award-in-relation-to-influenza-ah5n8-candidate-vaccine-301911153.html) on August 28, 2023, that BARDA selected the company to deliver one bulk lot of H5N8 A/Astrakhan antigen to support the U.S. government's pandemic response readiness under contract number [75A50122D00004](https://www.highergov.com/idv/75A50122D00004/) ($46.3 million). This is the third award CSL Seqirus has received from BARDA related to the ongoing outbreak of HPAI, following the February 2022 award to produce an H5N8 A/Astrakhan virus vaccine seed and the subsequent October 2022 announcement of the selection of CSL Seqirus to deliver an [H5N8 A/Astrakhan](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9227545/) virus vaccine candidate for assessment in a Phase 2 clinical study. Under the $30.1 million agreement, BARDA is [partnering](https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/newsroom/2022/influenzavaccines/) with GSK and CSL Seqirus to manufacture investigational lots of [H5N8](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2021-DON313) vaccines and clinically assess the safety, immunogenicity, and dose-sparing ability of adjuvants in combination with the manufactured vaccine candidates. CSL Seqirus established and will maintain the required pandemic readiness to deliver 150 million doses of cell-based pandemic influenza vaccine within six months of an influenza pandemic declaration in the U.S. In 2022, the [Holly Springs](https://www.cslseqirus.us/news/seqirus-holly-springs-manufacturing-facility-designated-by-us-government-as-pandemic-ready) facility successfully achieved all of BARDA's criteria required to establish domestic manufacturing capability for innovative cell-based seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. On October 5, 2022, CSL [announced](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/csl-announces-positive-preclinical-data-for-self-amplifying-messenger-rna-sa-mrna-influenza-vaccine-candidates-301641467.html) results from the preclinical studies of the company's self-amplifying messenger RNA ( [sa-mRNA](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-020-00204-y)) influenza vaccine candidates. The data, [published](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2329050122001383) in Molecular Therapy - Methods and Clinical Development, indicate that the sa-mRNA influenza vaccine candidates produced a potent, cross-reactive immune response against pandemic and seasonal influenza strains, A(H5N1) and A(H1N1) ( [Swine flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html)). U.S. Government Avian Influenza The U.S. government awarded California-based [Vir Bio](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/breaking-news/#/2022/10/04/1-billion-development-agreement-announced-emerging-infectious-disease-or-medical) a multi-year contract on October 4, 2022, with the potential for up to $1 billion to advance the development of a complete portfolio of innovative solutions (vaccines) to address influenza and other infectious disease threats. On [September 15, 2009](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5839a3.htm), four influenza vaccine manufacturers received approval from the FDA to use the influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent influenza vaccine to prevent bird flu outbreaks caused by the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. Europe Avian Influenza Vaccines [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/france-confirms-bird-flu-vaccination-after-favourable-tests-2023-05-26/) reported on May 26, 2023, France confirmed its intention to launch a bird flu vaccination program in late 2023. [Marc Fesneau](https://agriculture.gouv.fr/90e-organisation-mondiale-de-la-sante-animale-paris-la-lutte-contre-linfluenza-aviaire-au-coeur-des), Minister of Agriculture and Food Sovereignty, called for all avenues to be explored to improve the fight against HPAI, foremost among which is vaccination on May 22, 2023. Temporary authorization for use has recently been submitted for [vaccines for poultry](https://agriculture.gouv.fr/influenza-aviaire-mobilisation-generale-pour-faire-face-la-resurgence-de-foyers-dans-le-sud-ouest) being assessed by the French Agency for Veterinary Medicinal Products ( [ANMV](https://www.anses.fr/en/content/french-agency-veterinary-medicinal-products%E2%80%93-missions-and-activities#:~:text=The%20French%20Agency%20for%20Veterinary%20Medicinal%20Products%20(ANMV)%2C%20within,regard%20to%20veterinary%20medicinal%20products.)) and the European Medicines Agency ( [EMA](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/overview/public-health-threats/pandemic-influenza/vaccines-pandemic-influenza)). On April 6, 2023, [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/french-sanitary-agency-fine-tunes-bird-flu-vaccination-plan-2023-04-06/) reported France launched a tender for 80 million doses of bird flu vaccines. Only one chicken vaccine ( [Gallus gallus species](https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Gallus_gallus/)) has marketing authorization in France ( [2006](https://www.anses.fr/en/content/avian-influenza-chickens-cannot-be-vaccinated-winter#)). The [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_22_4363) (EC) signed a framework contract on July 28, 2022, for the joint procurement of GSK's [Adjupanrix](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/adjupanrix-previously-pandemic-influenza-vaccine-h5n1-split-virion-inactivated-adjuvanted), a pandemic influenza vaccine. As a result, EC Member States can purchase up to 85 million vaccine doses, if necessary, during an influenza pandemic. Japan Bird Flu Vaccines 2023 [Japan Health Ministry](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/topics/influenza/) announced in May 2023 that it is changing its avian influenza vaccine stockpile from [H7N9](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/seisakunitsuite/bunya/kenkou_iryou/kenkou/kekkaku-kansenshou/infulenza/dl/2013_0419_01.pdf) to the H5N1 virus. On May 25, 2023, local media reported that Japan intends to stockpile 10 million vaccines for people. In [2018](https://www.poultryworld.net/health-nutrition/japanese-authorities-battle-bird-flu-outbreak/), Japan began culling infected chickens. In [2008](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-birdflu-japan-dc/japan-to-vaccinate-medical-workers-for-bird-flu-idUKT22101620080415), Japan started testing bird flu vaccine versions. And in [2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323323/), after 79 years, a HAPI virus was detected in the dead chickens. Influenza A Monoclonal Antibody For Humans Vir Biotechnology, Inc. [VIR-2482](https://investors.vir.bio/news-releases/news-release-details/vir-biotechnology-achieves-target-enrollment-groundbreaking) is an intramuscularly administered investigational prophylactic [monoclonal antibody](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22246-monoclonal-antibodies) that has demonstrated in vitro the ability to neutralize significant strains of influenza A that have arisen since the [1918 Spanish flu pandemic](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/1918-pandemic-history.htm). The U.S. government purchased about [10,000](https://ir.biocryst.com/news-releases/news-release-details/us-government-exercises-option-purchase-additional-rapivabr-1) additional doses of RAPIVAB\u00ae in 2022. In 2014, [RAPIVAB](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/206426lbl.pdf) was approved for intravenous uncomplicated acute influenza in patients six months and older who have been symptomatic for no more than two days. Avian Influenza Vaccines for Birds The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) [announced](https://www.woah.org/en/woahs-animal-health-forum-reshapes-avian-influenza-prevention-and-control-strategies/) on June 7, 2023, it issued a comprehensive [report](https://www.woah.org/en/document/animal-health-forum-on-avian-influenza-policy-to-action-the-case-of-ai-reflections-for-change/) - [Animal Health Forum](https://www.woah.org/en/event/90th-general-session-of-the-world-assembly-of-delegates/#ui-id-3) on Avian Influenza - Policy to Action: The Case of Avian Influenza - Reflections for Change. It was recognized that a successful vaccination strategy must rely on authorized (bird flu) vaccines. \"Vaccinating is not the end, it is just the beginning. Vaccination application needs to be managed along the supply chain, including a surveillance program to detect active infection in vaccinated animals,\" said Dr. David Swayne, Disease Expert and Forum rapporteur. The United States Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service (APHIS) researchers [confirmed](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/04/14/fact-sheet-usda-continues-partner-engagement-mitigate-highly) on April 14, 2023, that they are currently testing several vaccine candidates. On May 16, 2023, [APHIS approved](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2023/ca-condor-hpai) the emergency use of an HPAI vaccine to prevent additional deaths of [California Condors](https://www.fws.gov/story/2023-05/california-condor-hpai-response-update-may-12-2023). The authorized vaccine is a killed, inactivated product conditionally licensed by APHIS' Center for Veterinary Biologics in 2016. Since the vaccine has not previously been tested against this strain of the HAPI virus in these species, the first step is a pilot safety study in North American vultures, a similar species. This vaccine trial will be conducted with surrogate vultures in North Carolina. As of June 2, 2023, [all vultures](https://www.fws.gov/story/2023-06/california-condor-hpai-response-update-june-2-2023) that received the HPAI vaccine as part of the initial trial on May 16 appear to be in good health with no vaccine site reactions. Depending on the results of this trial, the second step would be to implement the test on 25 captive California condors. The [DIVA strategy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12745380/) uses an inactivated oil emulsion vaccine containing the same haemagglutinin (H) subtype as the challenge virus but a different neuraminidase (N). The possibility of using the heterologous N subtype to differentiate between vaccinated and naturally infected birds was investigated by developing an \"ad hoc\" serological test to detect specific [anti-N1 antibodies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5790960/). Mammals Infected With Bird Flu Mammalian infection with bird flu news is posted at this [link](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/mammals-infected-bird-flu-2023). Bird Flu Medications The U.S. CDC currently recommends [antiviral medicines](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/monitoring/irat-virus-summaries.htm#table-summaries) for people who contract bird flu. However, some evidence of [antiviral resistance](https://asm.org/Articles/2022/July/Avian-Influenza-Past,-Present,-Future#:~:text=HPAI%20A(H5N1)%20is%20one,without%20any%20signs%20of%20illness.) has been reported in HPAI Asian lineage avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses (\"Asian H5N1 viruses\") and Asian lineage avian influenza A( [H7N9](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/h7n9-virus.htm)) viruses. Bird Flu Tests Bird flu virus infection is usually [diagnosed](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/avian-in-humans.htm#:~:text=Bird%20flu%20virus%20infection%20is,first%20few%20days%20of%20illness.) by collecting a swab from the sick person's upper respiratory tract (nose or throat). However, testing is more accurate when the swab is collected during the first few days of illness. And the ECDC [published](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/zoonotic-influenza-virus-infections-humans-testing-and-detection) on October 3, 2022: Testing for zoonotic influenza virus infections in humans. On June 22, 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture [announced](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2023/hpai-additional-funding) it is providing $502 million under the [Animal Health Protection Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/senate-bill/1482) to the [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service](https://www.usa.gov/agencies/animal-and-plant-health-inspection-service) to prepare for additional detections of HPAI in the U.S. Bird Flu Outbreak News 2023 Bird flu outbreak news for 2023 is posted "}
