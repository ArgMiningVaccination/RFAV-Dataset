Therefore, some people living with either of these diseases look toward compl ementary and altern ative medicine (CAM) to supplement con ventional therapies to help ease their symptoms. CAM is an umbrel la term that encompa sses a vast array of treatment option s. The National Center for Complement ary and Alternative Medic ine (NCCAM) defines CAM as a group of divers e medi cal and healthcar e syste ms, practices , and products that are not presently cons idered part of conventional medicine. While scientific evidence exists regarding some CAM therapies, for the most part, well-designed scientific studies to answ er questions such as whet her these therap ies are safe and whet her they work for the purposes for which they are used have not been conducted. Compl ementary therapies are intended to be used together with conventional treatment , while the term \"alternativ e\" implies replacing the treatment you receive from your doctor with one or more approaches that fall outside mainstream medic ine. The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation (CCF A) recommends that anyone cons idering any of the CAM approa ches should discuss them with their doctor, and use CAM as a complement to prescribed medications and not as an alternative to other doctor-recomm ended treatm ents. CAM therapies may work in a variet y of ways . They may help to control symptoms and ease pain, enhance feelin gs of well-being and qualit y of life, and may possibl y boost the immun e system. When considering any therapy , it is important to weigh the risks and benefits. In general, less research has been conducted on the safety and effectivene ss of CAM therapie s compared with conventional therapy . However , CAM therapi es are incre asingly subjected to scientifi c trials and more informatio n is becomi ng available to evaluat e some of these therapies. Ask your phys ician or CAM practitioner about any relevant research on the therapy you're undergoing. In addition to considering safet y and effectivene ss of a partic ular practice, it is also advis able to carefull y choose a practition er. For many of the CAM practices, practitioners must have specific educati on, licenses, and accreditation. Investigate the requirements and then check with the approp riate regulat ory board or agency. The NCCAM divides into four major doma ins\u2014Mind-Body Medic pulati ve y and Biolo gically -Based Practices. Mind -Body Medicine Mind- body medicine is a set of interventions that focus on the interpla y betw een emotional , mental , social, spirit ual, and behavi oral factors and their influe nce on health. Examples include prayer , tai chi, hypnos is, meditation, biofeedback, and yoga. Some techni ques that were considered CAM in the past, such as cognitiv e-behavioral therapi es and patient support groups, are now offered as conventional therapi es. Irwin M. Suzanne R. Rosenthal IBD Resource Center (IBD Help Center) 888- 694-8872 www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org 1 Manipulative and Body Practices Manipu lative and body-based practices involve mani pulation or movement of one or more parts of the body as a means of achieving health and healing. Examples include chiropr actic Medicine Energy medi cine draws on a number of tradition s supporting the view that illnes s results from disturbance s of subtle energi es. Energ y therapi es are based on the use of energy fields of two types: Biofield therapie s affec t energy fields that alleg edly surround and penetrat e the body . Thes e energy fields have not yet been scientificall y measured. Biofield therapies involv e the application of press ure or the placemen t of hand s in or through these energy fields. Example s include Reiki , qi gong, and therapeutic touch. Bioele ctromagnetic-based therapies utilize electromagnet ic fields for the purposes of healing. Exampl es incl ude magnetic therapy, sound energy therapy , and light therapy. Biologically -Based Practices The use of substances found in nature, such as herbs, foods , and vitamin s to strengt hen, heal, and balance the body is considered biologically-based practice. Examples include dieta ry acids , amin o acids, and functi onal foods. Some dietary supplement s are recomm ended for peopl e with Crohn 's and colitis because aspects of the disease can potentially cause vitami n and mineral deficiencies. Unlike pharmaceutical products, dietary supplements do not need approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they are marketed except in the case of a new dietary ingredient. Prescr iption drugs are subjected to rigorous testing. They must be shown to be both safe and effectiv e for the conditio n they are intended to treat before receiving approval from the FDA. These requirements do not apply to natural remedies, which mean that claims about thei r effectiv eness are largely unprov en. Just because the label on the bottle says its contents are safe and effective doesn't make it so. For patient s with Crohn's and colitis , the use of biologi cally-based products should only be used in addition to conventional medical treatment. Patient s should not s top taking their prescribed medication s even if they dec ide to use a suppl emen t. To learn more about regulation of dietary supplements visit: http://www.fda.gov/Food/Dietarysupplements/default.htm Vitamins Peopl e with IBD may develop vitami n or minera l deficienc ies that requir e supplementation for a variety of reasons; including Crohn's disease that affects the small intestine, certain drugs or surgeries, and other aspects of the diseases. Vitami n B-12 is absor bed in the lower section of the small intestine (ileum). People who have ileitis (Crohn's disease that affects the ileum) or those who have undergone small bowel surge ry may have vitami n B-12 defici ency. If diet and oral vitami n suppl ement s don't correct this deficiency, a monthl y intramuscul ar injection o f vitami n B-12 or once weekly nasal spray may be required. Folic acid (anot her B vitamin ) deficie ncy may occur in IBD patients who take the drug sulfasalazine or methot rexate . They should take a folate tablet , 1 mg daily , as a supplem ent. Vitami n D deficien cy is common in people with Crohn's disease. Vitamin D is essential for good bone formatio n and the metabolis m of calcium . A vitamin D supplement of 800 IU per day is recommen ded, particul arly for those with active bowel symptoms . A vitamin D deficienc y can lead to a calcium deficie ncy, which can also occur in people with Crohn's disease in the small intestine or who have had a section of the intestin e surgically removed. This may impai r the ability to absor b calcium, requiring supp lementation. At least 1,500 mg of calciu m daily is recommended, either in dietary form or as suppleme nts taken in three divided doses during the day. Irwin M. Suzanne R. Rosenthal IBD Resource Center (IBD Help 888- 694-8872 www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org 2 Bone health: Certai medicatio ns may also have an advers e effec t on bone health . Long- term use of prednisone and other steroids slows the process of new bone formation and accelerates the breakdown of old bone. It also interfere s with calcium absorption. Iron deficien cy (anemi a), which results from blood loss following inflammation and ulcerati on of the intestine s, can occur in people with ulcerat ive colitis and Crohn's (granulomatous ) colitis . Anemi a is treated with oral iron tablet s or liquid, usuall y 300 mg taken one to three times a day or intrav enous infus ions of iron taken weekly for eight weeks. Probiotics Probiot ics are live bacteria that are similar to benef icial (often called \"good\" or \"friendly\" ) bacteria that normally reside in es. Under normal circu mstances, benef icial bacter ia keep the growth of harmfu l bacteria in check. If the balanc e between good and bad bacteri a is thrown off, causing harmful bacter ia to overgrow , diarrhe a and other digestive probl ems can occur. Prob iotics are used to restore the balance of these \"good \" bacter ia in the body . They are available in the form of dietar y supplement s (capsules, tablets , and powders) or foods (yogurt, ferment ed and unfermented milk, miso, tempeh, and some juices and soy beverages). There is some evide nce to sugg est that use of probio tics may help peopl e with Crohn 's disease or ulcerative colitis to maintai n remission. Scient ific studi es have also shown that they may be useful for preventing and treati ng pouchitis (a con dition that can follow surgery to remove the colon). Taking probi otics is generally safe. Any side effects (such as gas or bloating) are usually mild. The safety of probi otics in young childr en, older adults, and people with compromised immune syste ms has not been adequately studied. Fish Oils Omeg a-3 fatty acids\u2014found in fatty fish such as salmon, mack erel, herring, and sardin es as well as some nuts and green veget ables\u2014provide an anti-inflammator y effect. They have several health benefits , including helpin g to reliev e the joint pain of rheumatoi d arthritis (an inflammator y disorder). It has been suggested that they may also help to reliev e the intestinal inflammation of Crohn' s disease and ulcerative colitis. Several studies evaluating omega -3 fatty acids for maintena nce of remissi on in Crohn's disease have yielded conflicting findin gs Aloe Vera Aloe vera is widely used topically for wound healing and pain relief. It is also though t to have anti-inflam matory properties. Som e people with mild-to-moderate ulcerativ e colitis who drink aloe vera juice have reported reduced symptoms. H owever , this effec t has not been demonstrated in scientifi c studi es. Anyone with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis considering using aloe vera should be cautioned that aloe vera, when taken orally, also has a laxative effect . In addition, it has qualitie s of an \"immu ne booster.\" A person with Crohn 's disease or ulcerative colitis should be careful about treatment s that can boos t an alread y overactiv e immun e system. Should I tell My Doctor I'm Using CAM Therapies? Inform your doctor about any CAM treatment (in any of the four domains described above) you've been using or are considering using. Even the most innocent-looking vitami n supplement migh t contai n ingredients that could interact with your medi cation or with other produ cts. Unconv entional therapi es can complement medical treatment , and possibly help control symp toms, ease pain, and incre ase well-being. But many questi ons remain surrounding their safet y and effectivene ss in treating the diseases and conditions they are supp osed to treat. Open discussio n with your physic ian will giv e you the oppo rtunit y to consider complem entary therapi es in an inform ed manne r. Irwin M. Suzanne R. Rosenthal IBD Resource Center (IBD Help Center) 888- 694-8872 www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org 3 Use the following questions as a guide to discuss CAM with your healthcare team: Are there complem entary and alternative therap ies you recommen these metho ds studi ed? its can I expe ct from this therapy? How will I know if the therapy is workin g or not? Is there a risk this will interfere with standard IBD treatments? Are there potentia l side effects ? What shoul d I look out for? Do you offer these as part of your practice? If not, can you refer me to a licensed practition er in the area? Are there specific CAM therapies you would advise against?
