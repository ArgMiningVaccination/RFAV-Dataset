Instead of vaccines, Bennett believes in strengthening his kids' immune system through organic nutrition, a chemical-free lifestyle and chiropractic care. With his older kids, he simply signed a vaccination waiver. Today, it's not as simple. In California, parents who refuse to vaccinate their children entering public school must have a medical provider sign a waiver. Because of the new law, officials report the overall rate of vaccine exemption for children entering kindergarten dropped from 3.1 percent in 2013 to 2.5 percent in 2014. \"They want to be educated. They also want us to recognize their fear and (they're) just trying to make the very best decision they can for their children,\" said pediatrician Dr. Catherine Hurley, who works at Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center. Hurley noted that in the past few weeks, she's seen families who refused the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine change their minds. \"I request that my families in my practice do follow the schedule, but obviously parents are in charge,\" Hurley said. With the most recent measles outbreak, health officials are urging those who are not vaccinated to avoid crowded places and stay home from school if someone contracts the disease. Even though measles is one of the most contagious viruses, Bennett's response to critics is that he feels his only obligation is to his family. \"If you want a different way of how to promote healthiness within your body, we've got a proven track record of four kids that's holding pretty darn strong against any family's recommendations,\" Bennett said.
