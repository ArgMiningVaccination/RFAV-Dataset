Page 4 By Hanae Armitage A new artificial intelligence algorithm can reliably screen chest X-rays for more than a dozen types of disease, and it does so in less time than it takes to read this sentence, according to a new study led by Stanford researchers. The algorithm, dubbed CheXNeXt, is the first to simultaneously evaluate X-rays for a multitude of possible mala- dies and return results that are consistent with the readings of radiologists, the study says. Scientists trained the algorithm to detect 14 different pathologies: For 10 diseases, the algorithm performed just as well as radiologists; for three, it under- performed compared with radiologists; and for one, the algorithm outdid the experts. \"Usually, we see AI algorithms that can detect a brain hemorrhage or a wrist fracture a very narrow scope for sin- gle-use cases,\" said Matthew Lungren, MD, MPH, assistant professor of radi- ology. \"But here we're talking about 14 different pathologies analyzed simultane- ously, and it's all through one algorithm.\" The goal, Lungren said, is to eventu- ally leverage these algorithms to reliably and quickly scan a wide range of image- based medical exams for signs of disease without the backup of professional ra - diologists. And while that may sound disconcerting, the technology could eventually serve as high-quality digital \"consultations\" to resource-deprived regions of the world that wouldn't oth- erwise have access to a radiologist's ex- pertise. Likewise, there's an important role for AI in fully developed health care systems too, Lungren added. Algorithms like CheXNeXt could one day expedite care, empowering primary care doctors to make informed decisions about X-ray diagnostics faster, without having to wait for a radiologist. \"We're seeking opportunities to get our algorithm trained and validated in a variety of settings to explore both its strengths and blind spots,\" said gradu - ate student Pranav Rajpurkar. \"The al-gorithm has evaluated over a 100,000 X-rays so far, but now we want to know how well it would do if we showed it a million X-rays and not just from one hospital, but from hospitals around the world.\" A paper detailing the findings of the study was published online Nov. 20 in PLOS Medicine .

The condition arises when abnormal fibrous connec- tions called adhesions form after abdominal surgery, teth- ering our normally slippery organs together or anchoring them to the abdominal wall. Symptoms can include chronic pain, female infertility, bowel obstruction and, occasionally, death. According to the National Institutes of Health, the annual cost of treating post-surgical adhe- sions in the United States surpasses $1 billion. \"This is a very common surgical complication, but it's not been well-studied,\" said Jonathan Tsai, MD, PhD, a former medical student at Stanford and now resident physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. \"Until now, it wasn't even known what cell type was in- volved in originating the adhesions. Now we've come up with a way to isolate the injured tissue before they form the adhesions, and identify the molecular pathways involved.\" The researchers developed and studied a mouse model of adhesion formation to identify the cell responsible for the initial steps. They also showed that an antibody-based therapy could break down those that had already formed. The hope is that similar techniques could help treat post- surgical adhesions in humans.

One promising approach may be to stimulate the re- generation of those cells with drugs. But there's a major obstacle: The growth triggered by the drug is willy-nilly, affecting tissues not just in the pancreas but throughout the body. Now, a team of Stanford endocrinologists and chem- ists has taken a step toward targeting the right cells more precisely, using a property that researchers have long known about but never exploited for treatment: Beta cells, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, have a particularly strong taste for zinc. In a study published online Dec. 6 in Cell Chemical Biology, Stanford researchers used that fact to selectively deliver a drug to beta cells. Justin Annes, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine, is the senior author. Graduate student Timothy Horton is the lead author. The method hasn't been optimized yet, and it isn't anywhere near ready for clinical use. \"We're at the earli- est stages,\" Annes said. But in a field where the main options are insulin injections and insulin pumps, which continuously deliver the hormone through a catheter, it could pave the way to more appealing alternatives. Seeding regeneration Diabetes is a disease in which the body can't produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels. For years, Annes' goal has been to develop a medication that would promote the regeneration of insulin- producing beta cells. Although some re- searchers deemed that impossible, Annes and his colleagues recently succeeded in cre- ating specific molecules that make beta cells divide and produce more beta cells. That advance might have given new hope to diabetes patients, but there was a catch: The way to get beta cells to start dividing and replicating is the same way to get lots of other cells to divide and rep- licate. In other words, researchers might be able boost the number of beta cells in the pancreas, but in the pro - cess they'd get lots of other cell types to replicate as well. The result would be uncontrolled, untargeted replica- tion that would affect lots of other organs beside the pancreas, most likely for the worse. Then Annes had a thought: Researchers have known since the 1940s that beta cells collect about 1,000 times more zinc than surrounding tissue cells. Researchers have mostly used that fact as a way to stain and visu- ally identify beta cells in pancreatic tissue samples. But Annes reasoned that if he could somehow get a re- generative drug to seek out zinc, he could get it to beta cells. Call in the chemists \"The only problem was, I didn't know how to generate compounds that could test this hypothesis,\" Annes said. So he turned to Horton, a graduate stu- dent in chemistry, and Mark Smith, a senior re- search scientist at Stanford ChEM-H and director of its Medicinal Chemistry Knowledge Center . Together, they devised a strategy based on chelation, a standard technique in chemistry that's per- haps best known in medicine as a treatment for lead and mercury poisoning. In such cases, doctors administer a drug that forms tight bonds with the metals, which can then be flushed out of the body. Annes, Horton and Smith aimed to use a zinc-chelating agent, which will bond to zinc wherever it runs into it, to deliver a drug to zinc-loving cells, but first they needed to see whether the chelating agent itself would accumulate in beta cells. After initial lab tests showed it did, they attached a beta- cell regenerating drug to the zinc-chelating agent, and found that the drug would also build up in beta cells in a lab dish. The team also showed that its zinc-chelation ap- proach amassed more of the drug in beta cells than other cell types. When the drug was administered to rat cells, including beta cells, in a dish, the beta cells re- generated about 250 percent more than other cell types. The effect was smaller but still present in human cells in a dish: Beta cells replicated about 130 percent more than nonbeta cells over the course of the experiment. That's not to say that a treatment is around the cor- ner, the researchers caution. \"This is the first demon - stration of a selectively delivered replication molecule in beta cells,\" Annes said, and \"it's not sufficient for thera- peutic applications.\" But the team believes the approach could one day lead to treatments if they can improve its beta-cell selectivity.

The study, which was published Dec. 3 in JAMA Internal Medicine, examined opioid use and abuse in a large group of privately insured patients from across the United States. Of nearly 15,000 young people who re- ceived initial opioid prescriptions from their dentists in 2015, 6.8 percent had additional opioids prescribed be- tween 90 and 365 days later, and 5.8 percent were diag- nosed with opioid abuse during the 12 months after the initial prescription. In a comparison group that did not receive an opioid prescription from their dentists, 0.1 percent got another opioid prescription and 0.4 percent were diagnosed with opioid abuse over the same period. The researchers began the study to explore the risks of wisdom tooth extraction, a common elective dental surgery in teenagers and young adults. Many patients are prescribed opioids to manage pain after wisdom tooth removal. \"This work raises two really important related but separate questions: Do we need opioids, and do we need the procedure?\" said the study's lead author, Alan Schroeder, MD, clinical professor of pediatrics at Stanford. Beneficial procedure? Though extremely common, wisdom tooth extrac- tions are not well-studied, and the balance of risks and benefits is not clear, Schroeder said. His overall research focus is \"safely doing less\" \u2014 trying to identify common interventions in pediatrics that may have unfavorable risk-benefit profiles and asking if they could be simpli- fied or eliminated for patient safety. Removal of disease- free wisdom teeth has not been studied thoroughly enough to determine whether it benefits patients, ac- cording to a 2016 Cochrane review of the subject. The research team used a database that contains de- identified information on millions of privately insured patients from across the United States. The research- ers focused on patients who were 16 to 25 years old in 2015, the age group in which wisdom tooth extractions are typically performed. The database included 754,002 people of these ages who were enrolled in health insur - ance for the entire year. Of those, 97,462 (13 percent) received at least one opioid prescription; 30 percent of the opioid prescriptions came from dental practitioners. To zero in on patients who had probably not had prior opioid exposure and who were probably receiving the drugs for elective dental procedures, the researchers excluded patients who had been hospitalized during the week before they were prescribed dental opioids, as well as all patients who had received other opioid prescrip - tions or been diagnosed with opioid abuse in the year before getting a prescription from a dentist. This left 14,888 young people who got an initial opioid prescrip- tion in 2015 from a dental practitioner. The median number of pills prescribed was 20. Each person in the group was matched with two control individuals who did not receive dental opioid prescriptions that year. Each control patient was ran -domly assigned a start date, which the researchers re- ferred to as their phantom prescription date, during 2015 for the study's one-year follow-up period. The researchers checked whether patients in either group got subsequent opioid prescriptions 90 to 365 days after the initial or phantom prescription date. They also examined whether patients' records during the year included diagnostic codes for opioid abuse. Tracking the opioid use Seventy-five percent of the opioid prescriptions were for hydrocodone-acetaminophen, commonly known by the brand names Lortab, Norco or Vicodin. In the 12 months prior to the real or phantom opioid prescrip- tion date, about 3 percent of subjects in each group had been diagnosed with substance abuse of nonopioid substances. Compared with patients in the control group, the group that received dental opioids had significantly greater rates of continuing opioid use and abuse. \"Almost 7 percent of these patients had new, per- sistent use at least three months after the initial pre- scription and almost 6 percent had an opioid abuse diagnosis,\" Schroeder said. \"That's pretty alarming.\" The youngest patients, ages 16 to 18, were signifi - cantly more likely to have persistent opioid use than the oldest patients, ages 22 to 25. Female patients were more likely to have persistent opioid use, while patients of Asian race/ethnicity were less likely to have persistent use. Follow-up research is needed to determine whether opioids are the safest method of treating pain from wisdom tooth extractions, and whether the extractions themselves are always necessary, Schroeder said. \"I think we should ask, No. 1, Why are we prescribing such a high quantity of opioids so frequently? And No. 2, Are all the procedures that are driving these opioid prescrip- tions necessary?\" he said. Schroeder is a member of the Stanford Child Health Research Institute.

That was the upshot of a Dec. 5 pre- sentation by Niraj Dangoria, associate dean for facilities planning and manage - ment, on the opportunities and chal - lenges of managing the school's growth needs. Dangoria spoke at a town hall meet- ing at Li Ka Shing Center for Learning and Knowledge that also included a brief update on the school's financial results for fiscal year 2018. \"At no point do we get so much space that we can say, 'Oh, our work is done,'\" he said. \"Space will always be a limited resource.\" Managing space at the school involves balancing faculty growth, workspace needs, the school's financial health and regulatory constraints, Dangoria said. Complicated planning Although the School of Medicine has added about 400,000 square feet of space in the last decade, including the Li Ka Shing Center and the Lorry I. Lokey Stem Cell Research Building, its annual faculty growth is exceeding the current available space. Immediate solutions have involved \"densifying\" space, which Dangoria described as \"trying to achieve the same functionality and outcomes in 15 to 20 percent less space.\" The long- term solution will require the school to double its off-campus space to accom- modate its growing research enterprise, faculty and staff. Because the campus straddles both the Santa Clara County and city of Palo Alto jurisdictions, planning construction is complicated. A 2011 development agree- ment, which allowed the construction of both the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford extension and the new Stanford Hospital, also requires the demolition of the seismically unstable Lane, Alway, Edwards, Grant and Bo- swell buildings, whose current occupants will need to be gradually relocated to al- low rebuilding over the next 10 years. \"Four-thousand people are being re- located in the next three to four years,\" Dangoria said. \"That's 40 percent of our overall population.\" Stanford's new Redwood City campus will have 600,000 square feet and four buildings, one of which will be the ad- ministrative center of the School of Med- icine. \"This campus is almost ready,\" Dangoria said. \"The first folks will be moving in in the spring of 2019.\" Meanwhile, the school's research cen - ter will shift to buildings both new and old in the Stanford Research Park. Ul- timately, 2,500 to 3,000 people will be based there \u2014 about 30 percent of the school's overall population. The education center will remain on the main campus. One of the new build- ings there will be the Biomedical Inno- vation Building, which is set to open in about 15 months. It will accommodate about 900 researchers, including 100 faculty, and feature a flexible, modu- lar infrastructure. \"We know research evolves continuously, and we want to build environments that allow this,\" Dangoria said. Along Quarry Road, the Center for Academic Medicine, opening in the fall of 2020, will embrace its verdant setting next to the Stanford Arboretum to foster an environment that supports physician wellness, Dangoria said. Housing 450 clinicians and another 500 or so clini- cal researchers, the building will feature amenities such as a gym, cafeteria and concierge services. \"We're going to work very hard to create a unique environment and very supportive environment for our clinical faculty,\" Dangoria said. With faculty, staff and administra- tion dispersed across three locations, the idea will be to change the way we think about the footprint of Stanford Medi- cine. \"Even today, when we think of the School of Medicine, we have to think of it as being on campus, at the research park and in Redwood City,\" Dangoria said. \"It's a reality, not an option.\" Financial health 'remains strong' In his summary of the last fiscal year, Samuel Zelch, MBA, chief financial of- ficer and associate dean for fiscal affairs, told the audience, \"The financial health of the school remains strong, as reflected in the FY18 net surplus of $109 million.\" Zelch pointed out that these results were similar to the prior year. However, fed-eral funding increased by 2 percent and nonfederal funding grew by 12 percent over the previous fiscal year, with spon- sored research growing to $689 million. Zelch added that the outlook for FY19 is also strong, despite a projected 8 percent growth in budgets against a 3 percent projected growth in revenue. The higher budgets, Zelch explained, repre- sent many new strategic investments in buildings, programs and people to sup- port the school's preeminence. Toward the end of the meeting, Lloyd Minor, MD, dean of the School of Medi- cine, thanked attendees for their service to Stanford Medicine. He then partici- pated in a brief question-and-answer ses- sion along with Dangoria, Zelch and Marcia Cohen, MBA, senior associate dean for finance and administration. ISM By Erin Digitale Short home videos can be used to di- agnose autism in children, according to a new study from the School of Medicine. The research, which was published online Nov. 27 in PLOS Medicine, ex- pands on a 2014 feasibility study on the topic by the same researchers. In the new study, the scientists employed machine learning to determine which features of children's behavior should be rated to evaluate autism, using computers to whittle down a long list of behavioral features to those most relevant to the di - agnosis. They also devised an algorithm that weights each feature to provide an overall diagnostic score for each child. \"Across the United States, the average waiting list to get access to standard-of- care can last up to a year,\" said the study's senior author, Dennis Wall, PhD, asso- ciate professor of pediatrics and of bio- medical data science at Stanford. \"Using home videos for diagnosis has the poten- tial to streamline the process and make it far more efficient.\" Home videos offer another potential advantage for diagnosing behavioral and developmental disorders such as autism. \"Home video catches the child in his or her natural environment,\" Wall said. \"The clinical environment can be stark and artificial, and can elicit atypical be- haviors from kids.\" Value of early diagnosis Autism is a developmental disor- der characterized by restricted inter- ests, repetitive behaviors and difficulty forming social connections. Previous research showed that behavioral thera - pies for autism work best when started before age 5, but long waitlists for test- ing make it difficult for families to access timely treatment. Current diagnostics are time-intensive, requiring one-on- one assessment with an autism specialist. Clinicians spend a few hours per patient assessing dozens of aspects of the child's behavior. In the new study, the researchers de- vised and tested eight machine-learning models for diagnosing autism from short videos. Each model consisted of a set of algorithms that included five to 12 fea- tures of children's behavior and produced an overall numerical score indicating whether the child had autism. To test the models, the researchers asked families recruited through social media and autism listservs to submit brief home videos, and received 116 videos of children with autism (average age 4 years, 10 months) and 46 videos of typically developing children (average age 2 years, 11 months) that met their criteria: The videos were 1 to 5 minutes long, showed the child's face and hands, showed direct social engagement or op - portunities for engagement, and showed opportunities for use of objects such as toys, crayons or utensils. Nine video raters received brief in- struction on how to evaluate each video, answering 30 yes/no questions about whether children in the videos exhibited certain behaviors such as using expressive language, making eye contact, expressing emotion and calling attention to objects. All of the yes/no questions were based on behavioral characteristics used in stan- dard autism screening tools. All nine raters scored 50 of the vid- eos, and the researchers used these results to determine that three raters were the minimum number needed to generate a reliable score. The remaining videos were randomly assigned to the raters, with three raters scoring each video. On average, watching and scoring the videos took the raters 4 minutes each. The data for each video, consisting of the 30 yes/no answers to questions about the child's behavior, was fed into the eight mathematical models. One model, a logistic regression model that used five behavioral charac- teristics, performed best, identifying au- tism with 88.9 percent accuracy overall, including correctly labeling 94.5 percent of children with autism and 77.4 percent of children without autism. To validate their findings, the re- searchers repeated the experiment with an additional 66 videos \u2014 33 featuring children with autism and 33 with chil- dren who did not have autism. The same model again performed best, with correct identification of 87.8 percent of children with autism and 72.7 percent of children without autism. \"We showed that we can identify a small set of behavioral features that have high alignment with the clinical out- come, that nonexperts can rapidly and independently score these features in a virtual environment online in minutes, and that the model we used to combine those features is effective in producing a score that matches the clinical outcome,\" Wall said. The final scores are not just a \"yes or no\" autism diagnosis, he added; instead, the numerical scores may hold information about the severity of the dis- order and be of value for tracking prog- ress over time. Providing tool for pediatricians Wall hopes simple scoring systems for home videos will help streamline the process of autism diagnosis. \"This could be used in general pediatric set - tings such as well-baby checkups,\" he said, adding that video scores could be plotted over time and compared with the general population, similar to how a child's height and weight are plotted on a growth chart. \"Our long-term dream is that a tool like this will give general pediatricians more confidence in making diagnostic decisions about autism and other devel- opmental disorders,\" he said. For a very young child \u2014 at an age when autism can be difficult to distinguish from nor- mal development \u2014 the doctor's deci- sion might be to engage in watchful waiting, but with the advantage of hav- ing a video score as a baseline for later evaluations. In other cases, it might be clear that a child needs to immediately begin autism treatment, or needs to be referred to a specialist for a more detailed diagnostic evaluation. The researchers are now repeating their investigation with home videos of young children in Bangladesh to see how well their mathematical models translate across cultures.

The protein causes the cells to remain pluripotent, meaning they can become any cell in the body, under conditions that would normally trigger them to de - velop into specialized cells. The unexpected finding is likely to fan the flames of a millennia-old debate as to the regenerative power of royal jelly. More importantly, the discovery reveals new pathways to pluripotency and sug- gests novel ways to keep stem cells in a state of suspended animation until needed for future therapies. \"In folklore, royal jelly is kind of like a super-medicine, particularly in Asia and Europe,\" said assistant professor of der- matology Kevin Wang, MD, PhD, \"but the DNA sequence of royalactin, the ac- tive component in the jelly, is unique to honeybees. Now, we've identified a struc- turally similar mammalian protein that can maintain stem cell pluripotency.\" Wang is the senior author of the study, which was published Dec. 4 in Nature Communications. Associate pro- fessor of surgery Derrick Wan, MD, is the lead author. Component of hive hierarchy Royal jelly is a critical component in the strict hierarchical structure of the honeybee hive. Under normal condi- tions, a single queen lays fertilized eggs that develop into female worker bees. These worker bees slave away collecting pollen and nectar, building the honey- comb, laying unfertilized eggs and tend - ing to larvae. In contrast, the drones loll about the hive, rousing themselves every so often to meet up with other drones at designated \"drone congregation areas\" where they hover until a new queen flies by and incites a mating riot. Eventually, a new queen is needed for the hive when an old queen dies or the hive grows too large and needs to split into two. In this case, the worker bees select a few female larvae to nurture ex- clusively with royal jelly \u2014 a viscous, slightly acidic substance composed of water, proteins and sugars \u2014 during their development. All larvae are fed with royal jelly for the first few days after hatching, but worker larvae are quickly switched to a combination of royal jelly, honey and a pollen concoction known as \"bee bread.\" Exactly how a royal jelly diet stimu- lates the formation of a large, fertile queen rather than a lowly worker bee has remained elusive. But humans quickly decided that what's good for the queen must be good for them. Although royal jelly has been suggested to have effects on cholesterol levels, blood pressure, nervous system and hormonal activity, it has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for medicinal use. 'How does this happen?' Wang wondered how a royal jelly diet could trigger the extreme differences seen between queen bees and the much smaller workers. After all, the two insect castes share an identical genome. \"I've always been interested in the control of cell size,\" Wang said, \"and the honeybee is a fantastic model to study this. These larvae all start out the same on day zero, but end up with dramatic and lasting differences in size. How does this happen?\" Wang and his colleagues focused on a protein \u2014 appropriately called roya- lactin \u2014 that previously had been sug- gested to be the active ingredient in royal jelly. They applied royalactin to mouse embryonic stem cells to study the cells' response. \"For royal jelly to have an effect on queen development, it has to work on early progenitor cells in the bee larvae,\" Wang said. \"So we decided to see what effect it had, if any, on embryonic stem cells.\" Embryonic stem cells are potent, but fickle. When grown in the laboratory, they often want to abandon their stem cell state and differentiate into special- ized cells. Researchers have devised ways to keep the cells in line by adding mol- ecules that inhibit differentiation to the environment in which the cells grow. To their surprise, Wang and col- leagues found that the addition of roya- lactin stopped the embryonic stem cells from differentiating, even in the absence of the inhibitors. \"This was unexpected,\" Wang said. \"Normally, these embryonic stem cells are grown in the presence of an inhibi - tor called leukemia inhibitor factor that stops them from differentiating inap- propriately in culture, but we found that royalactin blocked differentiation even in the absence of LIF .\" The cultured LIF- free cells grew happily for up to 20 gen- erations without losing their \"stemness,\" the researchers found. Additional experiments showed that the royalactin-treated stem cells exhib- ited gene-expression profiles similar to stem cells grown in the presence of the inhibitors, churning out proteins known to be associated with pluripotency while tamping down the production of pro- teins important for differentiation. Yet the cells' response was confusing because mammals don't make royalactin. For answers, the researchers turned to a database that infers the three-dimen- sional structure of proteins. Like a lock and key, many proteins work by fitting precisely together with other proteins or biological molecules. The scientists won- dered whether there might be another protein in mammals that mimics the shape, but not the Honeybee protein keeps stem cells youthful, study finds By Christopher Vaughan Botryllus schlosseri, a marine invertebrate that lives in underwater colonies resembling clusters of tiny pet- als clinging to rocks, has a blood-forming system with uncanny similarities to that of humans, according to scientists at Stanford University. In a study published online Dec. 5 in Nature, the researchers report that these lowly sea creatures are sci- entific \"treasure boxes\" that may provide a way to un- derstand our own blood-forming system, improve our immune function and find new immune-associated tools for biological discovery. \"The mammalian and Botryllus blood-forming systems also share hundreds of homologous genes, even though the two species are separated by over 500 million years of evolution,\" said former postdoctoral scholar Benyamin Rosental, PhD. Rosental shares lead authorship of the study with graduate student Mark Kowarsky. The senior authors are Irving Weissman, MD, the Virginia and D.K.

The researchers isolated the Botryllus stem cells that are the foundation of its blood and immune system, as well as the progenitor cells they make on their way to becoming adult blood and immune cells. \"Out of all the invertebrates, the Botryllus blood stem cells and progenitors are the most similar to vertebrate blood cells, so it is possible, if not likely, that they are the 'missing link' between vertebrates and invertebrates,\" said Weissman, who also directs the Stanford Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine and the Ludwig Cancer Center at Stanford. Botryllus is an organism with many odd characteris- tics. It lives part of its life as a free-swimming chordate \"tadpole\" \u2014 an animal without vertebrae but with a spinal bundle called a notochord. Then it attaches itself to a rock, undergoes metamorphosis to lose its noto- chord, tail, body muscles and one of its two brains, and settles down to live in colonies with other Botryllus or- ganisms on the subtidal surface. Like a bouquet of flowers Under the microscope, a Botryllus colony looks like a bouquet of flowers, although in reality each \"petal\" is a separate organism with its own heart, gills, digestive system, brain and blood cells. The separate Botryllus organisms in the colony share a common blood supply, and even exchange cells. This blood sharing allows stem cells for sperm and eggs and stem cells for body tissues to be shared throughout the growing colony. The researchers showed that there are close parallels between the blood systems in Botryllus and in mam- mals. They found that Botryllus has a sort of incubator of specialized cells, called a niche, that holds and sup- ports blood stem cells and is a lot like the blood stem cell niche in mammalian bone marrow. They also found that Botryllus blood stem cells will find their own way from blood vessels to the niche, exactly as they do in mammals. And they found 327 genes involved in blood cell formation in Botryllus that are similar to genes in- volved in blood formation in mammals. Previously, researchers in the Weissman lab showed that a single variant of a gene called BHF regulated whether separate Botryllus organisms would send out blood vessels from their own bodies and merge with adjacent individuals, or undergo an immune rejec- tion, preventing blood cell exchanges. The new study identifies how BHF regulates whether organisms fuse together in the colony: If the protein produced by the gene is recognized as compatible by the other colony, it prevents the activation of a rejection process that is sim- ilar to the way that the human immune system's natural killer cells attacks tissues that are not \"self.\" An excellent model The discovery of such strong parallels between the two systems offers researchers an excellent model for studying many biological phenomena in mammals, the researchers said. \"Blood stem cells in mammals are hard to find and, when found, it's very hard to follow what is going on in the blood stem cell niche,\" Voskoboynik said. \"Botryllus is a translucent organism, so we can easily spot the niche and visually follow the migration of each type of cell from one part of their body to the other.\" It's also easy to observe how Kevin Wang holds a flask of cells that have been engineered to produce the Regina protein, a mammalian protein similar in structure to the active component of honeybee royal jelly.PAUL SAKUMA Sea invertebrate sheds light on evolution of immune system Under the microscope, a Botryllus colony looks like a bouquet of flowers, although in reality each \"petal\" is a separate organism with its own heart, gills, digestive system, brain and blood cells.

Even when he grabbed a nap on a cot under a Red Cross blanket, he kept his boots on so he could be ready at a moment's notice to attend to patients. It was Nov. 28. Earlier that day, Burnier, a second- year resident in the Department of Emergency Medi- cine at Stanford, had treated an elderly man whose home had been destroyed in the Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in California history. \"I'm sure he was ex- pecting to live out his days in peace and at home,\" Burnier said. \"Everyone has a story, and the vast majority of their prob- lems we can't fix. It's humbling.\" Burnier had deployed with the Stan- ford Emergency Medicine Program for Emergency Response, or SEMPER, to provide medical support for people dis - placed by the fire, which started Nov. 8 in Butte County, California, and was not fully contained until Nov. 25. Since be- ing established in 2010, SEMPER has deployed teams of Stanford physicians and nurses to areas hit by disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, around the world. In addition to members of SEMPER, other Stanford Medicine employees have helped out in the wake of the fire's destruction, including a clinical assistant professor of emergency medicine who serves as the physician for Task Force 3 of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and veterinary technicians with the medical school's Department of Comparative Medicine. 'Second wave' of medical support The fire was responsible for at least 85 deaths. It destroyed nearly 14,000 homes and scorched 153,000 acres of land. More than 50,000 people were displaced. Some are still in shelters with nowhere else to go. The California Emergency Medical Services Authority called in SEMPER to provide a \"second wave\" of medical sup- port for displaced residents. \"We are not treating high trauma,\" said Ian Brown, MD, clinical associate professor of emergency medicine at Stanford and a leader of the SEMPER team that was volunteering Nov. 25-28. \"Our biggest concern is in- fectious disease and chronic conditions, like diabetes, that have gone untreated.\" Carol Conceicao, MD, a second-year emergency medicine resident at Stanford, treated a pregnant pa- tient at the shelter, but also set up a prenatal care plan for her. \"We are setting these patients up for life after this disaster,\" Conceicao said. Members of the SEMPER team were stationed at shelters on the Glenn County and Butte County fair- grounds. Joselinda Landon, one of two nurses on the team, acknowledged that the work was demanding. \"Sometimes we don't sleep. The adrenaline keeps us go- ing,\" she said. \"We might be up for 24 hours; we don't care.\" She said her focus was on the fire victims and what they were facing. \"The holidays are coming,\" she said, nodding to people gathered at the shelter. \"They don't have a home. Their family is gone. I can feel their pain.\" 'No way to outrun it' The Camp Fire was also different than anything Jus- tin Lemieux, MD, had experienced. A Stanford emer- gency medicine physician and veteran of several relief missions, he said he had never witnessed anything like the devastation in Butte County. Lemieux was part of the first wave of responders. He deployed as the team physician for FEMA Task Force 3 in the days immediately following the outbreak of the fire. The group established a base of operations in a trailer near what used to be the town of Magalia. There was no town when they arrived Nov. 17, just debris. During the briefing, the group was told that a wall of fire had raced through the neighborhoods at 800 meters per minute. Lemieux looked up the world record for the 800-meter run: 1:40. \"Basically, if someone saw the flames, it was too late,\" he said. \"There was no way to outrun it.\" In groups, the task force members, including Lemieux, walked slowly and methodically through ruined neighborhoods, searching from one end to the other for survivors or remains, over collapsed structures, caved roofs and sharp debris. Other hazards included downed power lines and burned, overhanging tree branches. The soil had weakened in spots, and search- ers moved cautiously to avoid falling in unseen septic tanks. The fire was still raging in areas, and the smoke was bad. But even worse, many buildings had asbestos and chemical products that had burned, potentially ex- posing team members to toxins. Lemieux and his team members wore head-to-toe protective equipment, in- cluding face masks. \"Sadly, the real service we were doing is searching, not rescuing,\" Lemieux said. Lemieux treated mostly foot injuries caused by the dangerous terrain. One of the first injuries came the night of Nov. 18 \u2014 to George, a highly-trained Ma- linois search dog. \"These dogs are incredibly stoic,\" Lemieux said. Back at the base of operations, two team members held George, more to reassure him than restrain him, as Lemieux stitched his leg. \"When I finished, George jumped up and licked the hell out of my face,\" Lemieux said. \"He seemed to know my job was to help him.\" Lemieux and the team were onsite in Magalia for more than a week, spending Thanksgiving in tents away from family and friends. Caring for injured animals After seeing the reports of animals injured in last year's fires in Northern California's wine country, Ofelia Satterfield and Candice Alfaro decided they wanted to be able to help in a future disaster. The two veterinary technicians in the Department of Comparative Medicine got the necessary training earlier this year and became part of a volunteer corps that could help during emergency situations. When the call for assistance went out during the Camp Fire, each of the women spent a daylong shift caring for the cats, dogs, birds and other small animals who were brought to a hangar at the Chico airport. During Alfaro's shift on Nov. 19, she helped triage the animals as they were brought in, and then spent hours caring for cats that had been burned. She said many of the cats were extremely de- hydrated after being on their own for days without food or water. Satterfield helped care for a variety of animals during her Nov. 24 shift, including a chinchilla that needed a dust bath, which helps remove dirt and excess skin oil from the rodent's fur. Although the animals were injured and away from their homes, Satterfield and Alfaro said the dogs and cats they treated seemed to realize that the volunteers were there to help them. \"They were pretty mellow,\" Alfaro said. Both of the women said it was difficult to watch dis- traught Butte County resi- dents come to the makeshift shelter in the hope of finding their lost pets. \"People had lost their homes, and they were still searching for their pets,\" Satterfield said. \"It was hard to see them come in and then leave without finding their pet.\" Both Alfaro and Satterfield said the fire reinforced why microchipping and registering pets is important. \"Some people might not think they need to microchip their pet if they keep the pet inside most of the time,\" Satterfield said, but in the case of a fire, animals can quickly scatter. The volunteers worked with animal control officials to document each of the wounded ani- mals to help owners locate their pets. The Department of Comparative Medicine donated supplies for the animals; Michael Renzi, director of fi- nance and administration for the department, delivered the supplies to Chico, in Butte County. Volunteers from the North Valley Animal Disaster Group and the California Veterinary Medical Reserve Corps have provided care for the animals affected by the fires.

The researchers found that a combination of two antibodies \u2014 one that targets the cells responsible for adhesion formation and another that silences a \"don't eat me\" signal that cancer cells use to evade the immune system \u2014 could significantly reduce the severity of established adhesions in the animals. \"Although we used a mouse model to study adhesion formation,\" Weissman said, \"we found similar characteristics in adhesions from patients, which makes us think this approach could be translated into the clinic.\" A common complication Normally the surface of our abdominal or- gans and the lining of our abdominal cavity are covered with a slippery membrane called me- sothelium. The mesothelium allows our organs to glide smoothly past one another when we bend, twist or run. When the mesothelium is disturbed, fibrous connections form between neighboring surfaces, ranging in severity from single threads to vast, immobilizing webs. The NIH esti- mates that about 93 percent of ab - dominal surgeries result in adhesions and that about 20 percent of surgical patients will be re-hospitalized for adhesion-related complications. Although the complication is common, it's not well-understood. Researchers have identified some cell types involved in later steps of the process, but it's not been known which cell type is responsible for the initial steps. It appears to arise in regions where blood flow is restricted, such as in the tiny pinches of tissue caused by surgical sutures. As a result, less oxygen is delivered to cells in the region \u2014 a condition known as hypoxia. Tsai used a mouse model of the condition to trace the formation of adhesions and the resulting patterns of gene expression in the mesothelium. \"We found that adhesions arise from cells of the mesothelium after injury,\" Tsai said. \"By tracing the patterns of gene expression, we were able to come up with a cellular 'family tree' for these fibrotic tissues and identify the biological pathways involved.\" Tsai and his colleagues found that, in mice, cells of the mesothelium respond to hypoxia by making a protein called HIF1alpha. This in turn promotes the expression of other proteins essential for the formation of adhesions. When the researchers treated the animals with a small molecule that inhibited the activity of HIF1al - pha, the resulting adhesions were significantly less severe. Possible role for macrophages They also found that treating the animals with antibodies that bind to mesothelin, a protein specific to injured mesothelium, sig- nificantly reduced the severity of adhesions that had already formed. Combining anti-mesothe - lin antibodies with an anti-CD47 antibody had an even greater effect, suggesting that roving immune cells called macrophages, which gob - ble up sick or dying cells, may also play a role in removing abnormal fibrous tissue. \"When the mesothelium is irritated, it be- gins to express mesothelin, which is normally expressed only very early in devel- opment,\" Weissman said. \"This triggers proliferation of the cells and initiates an inflammatory cascade that brings in immune cells and proteins that glom ev- erything up with fibrous tissue. But these cells also have CD47 on their surface, and we've found that anti-CD47 can synergize with anti- mesothelin to remove these adhe- sions after they've been formed.\" Finally, the researchers studied samples of adhesions that had been removed from patients. They found that the human tissue expressed many of the same genes and used similar biological pathways as those the researchers identified in the mice. Tsai and his colleagues are hopeful that similar antibody- based treatments may help prevent or treat the formation of adhesions in people.

ISM1What's the main thing that parents of children with severe peanut allergies should understand about the outcome of the trial? CHINTHRAJAH: T wo out of three patients who were treated with daily AR101 oral immunotherapy were able to tolerate two peanuts after one year of therapy. Now, this isn't a permanent cure, but taking roughly the equivalent of one peanut every day can change a patient's and family's quality of life. AR101 has the potential to be the first FDA-approved therapeutic for peanut allergy, paving the way for more treatment options and greater access. 2Do you think allergy immunotherapies could ever fully cure a food allergy? CHINTHRAJAH: As researchers, we continue to inves- tigate the mechanisms behind the pathogenesis of food allergy and potential therapeutic options in the quest for an approach to permanently change the immune system so that it no longer reacts to food in an abnor- mal way. Although we don't yet have a cure, the field of food allergy research has made leaps and bounds over the last decade, and we hope that momentum will only increase. 3The majority of participants in the study were chil- dren and adolescents, with only a small subset of adults. Is age a factor in the efficacy of allergy immu- notherapy? CHINTHRAJAH: In my experience, I've seen that oral immunotherapy can be successful in all age groups if participants continue in the desensitization program and adhere to taking a regular dose of the food. However, pilot studies have shown that oral immu- notherapy may have more lasting effects on the immune system if started at an early age. But as you might expect, many questions still remain: How long does an individual have to maintain a daily oral immunother- apy regimen? What is the best maintenance dose? And how long-lasting are the effects of oral immunotherapy? 4What do you say to people who may want to try to desensitize themselves or their children to a food allergen on their own? CHINTHRAJAH: We highly discourage desensitization at home without the guidance of trained allergists and clinical staff. The Parker Center at Stanford provides tremendous education and training about how to make this a safe process and how to take precautions with dosing. There is still a lot we are trying to understand. 5Can you speak to some of the other work that's be - ing pursued in food allergy desensitization? Is there ongoing research to see if oral immunotherapy could work for other allergy-triggering foods, like eggs or shellfish? CHINTHRAJAH: Multiple therapies are currently being explored, such as a phase-3 study investigating a peanut patch that delivers very small amounts of peanut via the skin. Other trials include under-the-tongue immuno- therapy with peanut combined with another compound that may stimulate the efficiency of the immunotherapy process. There are also a large number of phase-2 stud- ies showing success in oral immunotherapies for eggs, dairy, wheat, shellfish, tree nuts \u2014 even for multi-aller- gen oral immunotherapy, where patients are treated for multiple food allergens simultaneously. Our center has investigated combining certain drugs targeting allergic pathways with oral immunotherapies for patients with peanut, milk and multiple food aller- gies. Our goal is to identify approaches and markers that can help clinicians best deliver safe and efficacious therapy for food-allergy patients, and we're excited to continue applying these principles in studies we're de- signing for the future. ISM Any parent of a child with a severe pea- nut allergy knows the peril of a PB&J. For those with the condition, just sitting next to someone eating peanut butter can trigger a reaction. Now, scientists have established the validity of what could become the first oral anti- peanut-allergy drug. Stanford was one of 66 sites to participate in a phase-3 clinical trial of the therapy. The results were published Nov. 22 in The New England Journal of Medicine. Sharon Chinthrajah, MD, clinical associate professor of medicine and of pediatrics, was the principal investigator at the Stanford site. Chinthrajah is a member of the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford, which is led by Kari Nadeau, MD, PhD, professor of pediatrics. Participants in the trial ingested a dose of a peanut-derived immunotherapy drug called AR101 each day. They began with a small dose and gradually increased the amount, conditioning their immune systems to tolerate peanut proteins. The goal was to dampen the immune response \u2014 which can result in swelling, itching and difficulty breathing \u2014 so it would no longer be life-threatening. In a conversation with science writer Hanae Armitage, Chinthrajah discussed the trial in more depth, highlighting the value it brings to those with peanut allergies, and how it advances allergy research overall.

The Stanford team, which includes 13 faculty members, is one of only three groups nationwide to receive such an award from the Ameri- can Heart Association-Allen Initiative in Brain Health and Cognitive Impairment, a collaborative funding initiative sponsored by the AHA and the Paul G. Allen Initiative, a division of the Allen Institute. The project will focus on the influence of immune factors and systemic inflammation on the brain, said principal investigator Tony Wyss-Coray, PhD, professor of neurology and neurological sciences. The goal is to uncover molecules in the blood that affect cerebrovascu- lar and brain health in aging and in people with vascular risk factors, including stroke and obesity. The number of individuals suffering from age-related cognitive im- pairment and dementia is reaching unprecedented levels, Wyss-Coray said. \"We will study extensively a cohort of 400 participants with vas- cular cognitive impairment or with a risk of cognitive impairment, using various 'omics' approaches to identify potential new biological pathways and molecular targets, with the ultimate goal of moving new treatments into clinical studies,\" he said. The grant's scientific co-PI, Marion Buckwalter, MD, PhD, asso- ciate professor of neurology and neurological sciences and of neuro- surgery, noted that age and vascular risk factors are common to most people with dementia. \"Although a lot of research has been done into genetic causes of Al- zheimer's disease, relatively less attention has been directed to vascular causes,\" Buckwalter said. \"In fact, a majority of people with dementia have some vascular pathology in their brains. We will study people at high risk of developing dementia, and also animal models, to find which bloodborne molecules affect cerebrovascular function and cog- nition. A major next step will be developing new treatments to prevent dementia, and this grant will enable us to get to this step.\" Funding from Stanford's Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute to both Wyss-Coray and Buckwalter funded foundational studies that led to the new research proposal.

For 11 of the 14 patholo- gies, the algorithm made diagnoses with the accuracy of radiologists or better. Back in the summer of 2017, the National Institutes of Health released a set of hundreds of thousands of X- rays. Since then, there's been a mad dash for computer scientists and radiologists working in artificial intel- ligence to deliver the best possible algorithm for chest X-ray diagnostics. The scientists used about 112,000 X-rays to train the algorithm. A panel of three radiologists then re- viewed a different set of 420 X-rays, one by one, for the 14 pathologies. Their conclusions served as a \"ground truth\"\u2014 a diagnosis that experts agree is the most accu- rate assessment \u2014 for each scan. This set would eventu- ally be used to test how well the algorithm had learned the telltale signs of disease in an X-ray. It also allowed the team of researchers to see how well the algorithm performed compared with the radiologists. \"We treated the algorithm like it was a student; the NIH data set was the material we used to teach the student, and the 420 images were like the final exam,\" Lungren said. To further evaluate the performance of the algorithm compared with human experts, the scien- tists asked an additional nine radiologists from multiple institutions to also take the same \"final exam.\" \"That's another factor that elevates this research,\" Lungren said. \"We weren't just comparing this against other algorithms out there; we were comparing this model against practicing radiologists.\" What's more, to read all 420 X-rays, the radiologists took about three hours on average, while the algorithm scanned the X-rays and diagnosed all pathologies in about 90 seconds. Next stop: the clinic Now, Lungren said, his team is working on a subse- quent version of CheXNeXt that will bring the research - ers even closer to in-clinic testing. The algorithm isn't ready for that just yet, but Lungren hopes that it will eventually help expedite the X-ray-reading process for doctors diagnosing urgent care or emergency patients who come in with a cough. \"I could see this working in a few ways. The algo- rithm could triage the X-rays, sorting them into pri-oritized categories for doctors to review, like normal, abnormal or emergent,\" Lungren said. Or the algo- rithm could sit bedside with primary care doctors for on-demand consultation, he said. In this case, Lungren said, the algorithm could step in to help confirm or cast doubt on a diagnosis. For example, if a patient's physical exam and lab results were consistent with pneumonia, and the algorithm diagnosed pneumonia on the pa- tient's X-ray, then that's a pretty high-confidence diag- nosis and the physician could provide care right away for the condition. Importantly, in this scenario, there would be no need to wait for a radiologist. But if the algorithm came up with a different diagnosis, the pri- mary care doctor could take a closer look at the X-ray or consult with a radiologist to make the final call. \"We should be building AI algorithms to be as good or better than the gold standard of human, expert physi- cians. Now, I'm not expecting AI to replace radiologists any time soon, but we are not truly pushing the limits of this technology if we're just aiming to enhance exist- ing radiologist workflows,\" Lungren said. \"Instead, we need to be thinking about how far we can push these AI models to improve the lives of patients anywhere in the world.\" ISMin the United States, a figure expected to reach 20 million by 2026, according to the National Cancer Institute. But the cognitive side effects of cancer treat - ment can be debilitating and prolonged: Adults may be unable to return to work, and children often struggle in school. \"It's wonderful that they're alive, but their quality of life is really suffering,\" said the study's lead author, Erin Gibson, PhD, a research scientist at Stanford. \"If we can do anything to improve that, there is a huge population that could benefit.\" Scientists have long known that drugs like methotrexate impair all of the body's rapidly dividing cells, but how such drugs affect the function of brain cells has been poorly understood. \"Cognitive dysfunction after cancer therapy is a real and recognized syn- drome,\" said Michelle Monje, MD, PhD, associate professor of neurology and neurological sciences and the study's senior author. \"In addition to existing symptomatic therapies \u2014 which many patients don't know about \u2014 we are now homing in on potential interventions to promote normalization of the disor- ders induced by cancer drugs. There's real hope that we can intervene, induce regeneration and prevent damage in the brain.\" Chemo brain is especially severe in childhood cancer patients, Monje added, and children have the most to gain from better remedies. Inside the white matter In addition to neurons, which trans- mit nerve impulses, the brain's white matter contains other cells that help the neurons function. The research fo -cused on three types of those cells: oli- godendrocytes, which produce and maintain myelin, the fatty insulating sheath around nerve fibers; astrocytes, which link neurons to their blood supply, promote proper connections between neurons and maintain the neurons' en- vironment; and microglia, immune cells that can engulf and destroy foreign in- vaders in the brain, as well as sculpt neu- ral circuitry. Comparing postmortem frontal lobe brain tissue from children who had and had not received chemo- therapy, the re- searchers showed that there were far fewer oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the brains of the chemotherapy-treated children. To figure out what was happening to these cells, the researchers injected young mice with methotrexate at levels de- signed to replicate human exposures dur - ing cancer treatment. The mice received three doses at weekly intervals. Four weeks later, the researchers compared the mice's brains to those of mice that had not received the drug. Methotrexate chemotherapy was found to damage the brain's popula- tions of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Normally, these cells can quickly divide to replace any that are lost, but after methotrexate was administered, this self- renewal process did not happen correctly. More precursor cells than normal were starting down the path of maturation to oligodendrocytes, but they were getting stuck in an intermediate, immature state. The same problem was seen in mice brains six months after methotrexate was administered. T ransmission electron microscopy of the mouse brains after methotrexate administration revealed deficiencies in the thickness of the myelin insulation around nerve fibers, similar to changes in the brains of humans who have received chemotherapy. Mice exposed to metho- trexate also exhibited behavioral prob- lems after four weeks that were similar to humans with chemo brain, including motor impairment (slower movement of their forepaws), signs of anxiety on an \"open field\" test used to assess how threatened the animal feels in an unshel- tered environment, and impaired atten - tion and short-term memory function, evidenced by the inability to discern between novel and familiar objects \u2014 a symptom that per- sisted for six months after methotrexate was given. The researchers injected oligoden- drocyte precursor cells from healthy animals into the brains of animals that had received methotrexate to see if the cells' maturation problems were caused by some aspect of the brain environment after chemotherapy. The precursor cells still began maturing at higher-than-nor - mal rates but did not get stuck partway through the maturation process, indi- cating that the brain environment was partly responsible for the cells' abnormal maturation. Microglial activation Further study showed that microglia, the brain's immune cells, were persis- tently activated after methotrexate expo- sure for at least six months. The activated microglia caused problems for astrocytes, the cells that help neurons get nutrients and function properly. Administering a drug that selectively depleted microglia to mice that had been treated with meth- otrexate reversed many of the cognitive symptoms of chemo brain and reversed the abnormalities in maturation of oligo- dendrocyte precursor cells, activation of astrocytes and myelin thickness. \"The biology of this disease really derscores important intercellular crosstalk is,\" Monje said. \"Every cell type is affected in this patho- physiology.\" She suspects this type of complex dysfunction may also underlie other cognitive disorders. \"I think that is probably more the rule than the excep- tion,\" she said. More research is needed to under- stand exactly how the different cell types are signaling to each other, as well as when and how medications could be best deployed against chemo brain. \"If we understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to cognitive dysfunction after cancer therapy, that will help us develop strate- gies for effective treatment,\" Monje said. \"It's an exciting study's other Stanford co-authors are MD-PhD student Surya Nagaraja; undergraduate students Alfonso Oc- ampo, Lydia Tam, Andrea Goldstein, Praveen Pallegar and Jacob Greene; for- mer medical student Lauren Wood, MD; postdoctoral scholar Anna Geraghty, PhD; research assistants Lijun Ni and Pamelyn Woo; the late Ben Barres, MD, PhD, professor of neurobiology, of devel- opmental biology and of neurology scholar and Hannes MD, professor of pathol- ogy and of pediatrics.

Wang found a mammalian protein called NHLRC3 that was predicted to form a structure similar to royalactin and that was produced early in embryonic development in all animals from eels to humans. Furthermore, they discovered that NHLRC3, like royalactin, was able to maintain pluripotency in mouse em- bryonic cells, and that it caused a similar gene-expression pattern in them as in those cells exposed to royalactin. They renamed the protein Regina, which is Latin for queen. The researchers next plan to inves- tigate whether Regina has any thera- peutic value in wound healing or cell regeneration in adult animals. They also hope their finding will help researchers discover more or better ways to keep embryonic stem cells pluripotent when grown in the laboratory. \"It's fascinating,\" Wang said. \"Our ex- periments imply Regina is an important molecule governing pluripotency and the production of progenitor cells that give rise to the tissues of the embryo.

ISMBy Nathan Collins Mark Cullen, MD, senior associate dean of research in the School of Med- icine, has been named senior associate vice provost for research at Stanford. In the new role, Cullen will advise Kathryn Moler , PhD, vice provost and dean of research, on universitywide re- search policy and compliance issues, as well as develop strategy on the future of the institutes, independent labs and centers overseen by Moler's office. \"Mark is a great university citizen. His experience in the school of medicine and expertise in social science research will be invaluable as we think about the future of shared resources and interdisciplinary collaboration at Stan- ford,\" Moler said. Much of Cullen's job will be to advise Moler on policy and compliance across the research enterprise, which has changed significantly in nature and scope over the last decade. Among the issues Cullen will focus on, Moler said, is the development and implementation of rules meant to head off the possibility of undue foreign influence on federally funded research while maintaining a spirit of openness and the free exchange of sci- entific ideas. Cullen will also spearhead an effort to take stock of the dean of research's institutes, independent labs and centers, which have expanded both in number and scope. Today, there are 18 such units, covering everything from biosciences to economic policy. \"They're hugely important for the research enterprise,\" Cul- len said, adding that with the university's long-range planning process underway, now is the right time to think strategically about the role they will play in the next decade and beyond. \"Stanford is an unparalleled research environment, and the question is can we move it the next mile. That's where the heavy lifting is going to come,\" said Cullen, professor of med- icine, of biomedical data science and of health research and policy. \"It's an opportunity that I think anyone in my position would jump at.\" Cullen came to Stanford in 2009 from Yale University and immediately took on leadership positions. From 2009 to 2015, he served as chief of the division of general medicine disci- plines in the School of Medicine. Since 2015, he has directed the Stanford Center for Population Health Sciences and will continue in both that role and as senior of associate dean of research in the School of Medicine. Cullen began his position as senior associate vice provost for research in October. ISMMark Cullen appointed senior associate vice provost for researchpeople of note reports on significant honors and awards for faculty, staff and students Ronald Dalman, MD, the Walter Clifford Chidester and Elsa Rooney Chidester Professor of Surgery and chief of vascu- lar surgery, has been appointed associate dean for market devel- opment at the School of Medicine. In this new role, Dalman will serve as faculty partner for Stanford Health Care market and business development lead- ership. He will also work closely with clinical chairs, chiefs and staff to iden- tify and optimize network and affilia- tion agreements across the region to achieve established goals of the inte- grated strategic plan.
