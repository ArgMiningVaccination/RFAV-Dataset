No two people are the same, and through Ayurveda, you can find a certain care system catered to a person's specific needs. There are three doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Each dosha has different hair characteristics. An imbalance in one of the doshas is what is said to cause hair fall, lackluster hair, or various health issues. In the natural hair community, Ayurvedic hair care practices include using herbs and roots in their powder, whole, or dehydrated form in order to receive outstanding nutrients for the hair.
