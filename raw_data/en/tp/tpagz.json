Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of single-stranded non-coding RNA molecules of ap-proximately 22 nucleotides that play crucial rolesin gene expression [1]. They generally bind tocomplimentary sequences in the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of specific protein-coding genes,but can also interact with other regions of thegene including 5 UTR and the coding region, in- cleavage repression[2]. miRNAs are singlemiRNA can recognize hundreds of mRNA tran-scripts, allowing them to regulate a diverse rangeof biological pathways. In mammals, an estimated60% of all protein-coding genes may containmiRNA binding sites [3,4]. Furthermore, miRNAdysregulation is frequently associated with hu-man diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular dis-eases, central nervous system diseases, and meta-bolic disorders [5 -8], suggesting their potential as targets for the development of novel therapies forseveral diseases. There are currently many efforts focusing on the development of miRNA therapeu-tics for the treatment of human diseases. Severalpreclinical studies on therapeutic miRNA replace-ment have been initiated [9 and the first liposomal nanoparticle formulation of miR-34amimic (MRX34) has entered clinical trials in pa-tients with primary liver cancer [12], highlightingthe therapeutic potential of miRNA-based novelapproaches to treat diseases. However, severeon-target or off-target side effects could becaused by artificial miRNAs [13,14].Herbal medicine has been used to diseasesfor secondary metabolitessuch as polyphenols, alkaloids, saponins, and tan-nins have been systematically studied and used asan important source for drugs. However, syntheticsupplements of phytochemicals often do not havethe same efficacy as complex herb materials. Thenatural biological active components and mecha-nistic understanding of actions of plant-deriveddrugs are permanently discussed.Abstract ! Herbal medicine has been used to treat diseasesfor centuries; however, the biological active com-ponents and the mechanistic understanding ofactions of plant-derived drugs are permanentlydiscussed. MicroRNAs are a class of small, non-coding RNAs that play crucial roles as regulatorsof gene expression. In recent years, an increasingnumber of reports showed that microRNAs notonly execute biological functions within theiroriginal system, they can also be transmited fromone species to another, inducing a posttranscrip-tional repression of protein synthesis in the recip-ient. This cross-kingdom regulation of microRNAsprovides thrilling clues that small RNAs from me-dicinal plants might act as new bioactive compo-nents, interacting with the mammalian system.In this article, we provide an overview of the cross-kingdom communication of plant-derivedmicroRNAs. We summarize the microRNAs iden-tified in medicinal plants, their potential targetsin mammals, and discuss several recent studiesconcerning the therapeutic applications of plant-based microRNAs. Health regulations of herbalmicroRNAs in mammals are a new concept. Con-tinuing efforts in this area will broaden ourunderstanding of biological actions of herbalremedies, and will open the way for the develop-ment of new approaches to prevent or treat hu-man diseases.

Notably, oral consumption of a plant-based diet may lead tothe cross-kingdom transfer of plant-derived miRNAs in mam-mals. Zhang et al. [19] reported miRNAs derived from plant-based foods function as active signalling molecules to regulatemammalian genes. The authors showed that exogenous miRNAs(e.g., MIR168a and MIR156a) from rice were absorbed by cells ofthe gastrointestinal (GI) tract of the consuming animal, packagedinto exosomes, then migrated through the plasma, and were de-livered to specific organs where they bound to low-density lipo-protein receptor adapter protein 1 (LDLRAP1) mRNA and inhib-ited LDLRAP1 expression, thereby influencing cholesterol trans-port [19]. These studies provide thrilling clues that miRNAsmight act as new bioactive compounds in medicinal plants. If thishypothesis can be validated, it will broaden our understanding ofherbal remedies and, more importantly, will provide new in-sights into the development of miRNA-based therapeutics withhigh efficiency, reduced side effects, and low costs. reviewprovides current knowledge of cross-kingdom communicationof plant-derived miRNAs, summarizes the identified inmedicinal plants, and discusses several recent studies concerningthe therapeutic applications of medicinal plant-based miRNAs. Evidence for the Uptake of Plant miRNAs by Mammals ! Immediately after Zhang s group discovery, numerous details of this study have been appraised. In general, follow-up studieshave focused on detecting exogenous small RNAs in mammalsafter different diets. The results remain controversial, as summar-ized in l \"Table 1 , with some findings being consistent with the original publication [19 -27] while others are questioning the re- sults [28 -32]. Recent reports from two groups have attracted great attention.Yang et al. [20] identified the influence of diet preference andhealth issues on the uptake of plant-based small RNAs. A signifi-cant increase of plant miRNA MIR2911 in both blood and urinewas observed in mice that were fed with an herbal diet ( Lonicera japonica Thunb., Caprifoliaceae; common name: honeysuckle) for several days. Damaged guts resulting from chemotherapeutic(cisplatin) treatment also enhanced plant-based miRNA uptake.In addition, a single large oral dose miRNAs (e.g.,400 pmol of synthetic MIR2911 theshort-term detection of serum miRNAs. The following studydemonstrated that the level of circulating MIR2911 was associ-ated with the dietary intake level [33]. Zhang s group raised the critical issues for the accurate measurement of exogenousmiRNAs such as RNA extraction method and internal controls[21]. These studies supply reasonable explanations on the publi-cations reporting undetectable exogenous miRNAs. Firstly, smalldosages over short time feedings of a plant diet may not inducedetectable miRNAs in plasma. Secondly, natural ingredients inan herbal diet may protect plant miRNAs against degradationand enhance the uptake of miRNAs in the mammalian system,while naked miRNAs may not survive the digestion and circula-tion process. Thirdly, the health conditions of the GI tract may in-fluence the uptake of plant-based miRNAs. Fourthly, not only theplant miRNAs in plasma, but the potential deposition of dietarymiRNAs in other body tissues should also be taken into account. Finally, canonical methods for exogenous plant miRNA measure-ment are necessary to ensure the sensitivity and precision ofmiRNA detection. Plant-Based miRNAs for Therapeutics ! Although the role of exogenous miRNAs is currently not wellunderstood, the biological effects of plant miRNA in the mamma-lian system have been profiled. Using computational tools, 12 pu-tative miRNAs were identified from Curcuma longa L. (Zingibera- ceae) and found to bind with various target genes related to hu-man diseases such as diabetes mellitus type II, cardiovascular dis-orders, Alzheimer s, cancer, and thalassemia [34]. Similarly, a to- tal of six putative miRNAs were identified from Gmelina arborea Roxb. (Lamiaceae), while the mammalian target genes associatedwith cancer, blood borne disease, and other urinary infectionswere predicted [35].Exosomes are one of the natural carriers of miRNA, serving in extracellular communication [36]. models, biological of plant exosomes have been investigated. GELNs can pene-trate through the intestinal barrier, can be taken up by intestinalstem cells, and mediate intestinal tissue remodelling [37]. Oraladministration of GELNs protected mice against dextran sulfatesodium-induced colitis. Apart from proteins and lipids, miRNAs,with almost 100 different kinds, were identified from GELNs [37].Furthermore, exosome-like nanoparticles derived from edibleplants, including grapes, grapefruit, ginger, and carrots, were tak-en up by mouse intestinal macrophages and stem cells. Theywere biologically active in maintaining intestinal homeostasisthrough activation of nuclear (erythroid-derived 2)-like-2factor (Nrf-2), induction of anti-inflammatory molecules, and in recipient cells [38]. These studiessuggested that plant miRNAs might be packaged into exosome-like nanoparticles that would be taken up by the intestine, andexert beneficial effects under both physiological and pathologicalconditions.The most direct evidence of therapeutic effects of plant miRNAshas been recently published by Zhang s group [22]. A plant- derived miRNA, MIR2911, is highly stable in the decoction of aChinese herb honeysuckle, which has been traditionally used inChina for centuries to treat influenza infection. This miRNA canbe absorbed by the GI tract and be delivered via the bloodstreamto the lungs of the animals, which were continuously fed with ahoneysuckle decoction. Importantly, this plant miRNA could di-rectly target various influenza A viruses, suppress their replica-tion process, and protect against influenza virus infections inmice. The region of the influenza genome that MIR2911 targetedwas also identified, and validated in a mutant virus in which thesequence was modified and resistant to MIR2911 treatment [22].This groundbreaking study suggested that plant miRNA may actas a novel bioactive ingredient that can be absorbed by mammalsand reduce the risk of many diseases.Recently, the therapeutic potential of plant-based miRNAs incancer was experimentally confirmed [23]. A cocktail of threemammalian tumor suppressor miRNAs was synthesized withmethyl groups on the 2 position of the ribose of the 3 nucleotide to mimic miRNAs of plant origin. Oral administration of theseplant-based tumor suppressor miRNAs together with total plantRNA [isolated from thaliana (L.) (Brassica-1154 ...Planta Med 2016; 82: 1153 -1162Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited.

Interestingly, there was a slight tumor burden reduction in the mice treated with to-tal plant RNA alone compared with water-treated mice, althoughnot statistically different, suggesting that plant total RNA mayhave a therapeutic effect [23]. This study indicated that plant en-gineered miRNAs that are designed for specific targets have sig-nificant potential in clinical therapeutic applications.The cross-kingdom regulation of human cancer growth by plantmiRNA has been further confirmed using in vitro and in vivo models [24]. Plant-derived miR159, presented in both raw andcooked foods (e.g., broccoli), was not only abundant in healthyhuman serum, but also detectable in breast cancer tissues. By tar-geting 3 UTR of transcription factor 7 ( TCF7 ), O- methylated miR159 and human serum extracellular vesicles(EVs) significantly suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation. Intumor xenograft models, the mice that were continuously fedwith synthetic miR159 showed significantly reduced tumorgrowth compared with those that received scrambled control oli-gonucleotides. However, no affection was observed in the xeno-graft tumors that stably overexpressed TCF7 without the 3 UTR [24]. This study consolidated the assumption that circulatingmiRNAs absorbed from dietary plants can be transportedthrough EVs-mediated trafficking, reach target tissue, and impacthuman health and disease.It is noteworthy that reaching biologically active levels of circu-lating plant miRNAs through oral intake might require feedingwith an herbal decoction, ground plant material, or food matrix[19,22,37] together, or long-term feeding regimes [22 -24], sug- gesting that a plant-derived matrix as well as prolonged expo-sure might be the important factors that facilitate the high leveluptake of plant miRNAs with therapeutic effects. Stability of Plant miRNAs ! A crucial concern regarding therapeutic plant miRNAs is theirstability in the preparation process as well as in mammalian cir-culation. The innate capacity of plant-derived miRNAs (e.g.,miR166, miR167, miR168, and miR159) are degradation resist-ant, as evidenced that storage, processing, and cooking do notabolish the plant miRNAs present in rice, soybeans, potatos, broc-coli, and cabbage [19,24,39]. Unlike mRNA that losses integrityduring processing, plant miRNAs are robust during soaking, boil-ing, and homogenization processes, and even survive under un-favorable physiological conditions such as an extreme pH (e.g., si-mulated gastric fluid with pH of 1.2), frequent bowel movements,and potent ribonuclease (RNase) treatment [19,39]. However, itis also reported that the majority of miRNAs were degraded inthe honeysuckle decoction after boiling for 30 min, whileMIR2911 possesses a specific sequence and high GC content,which makes it highly stable in this decoction and resistant toRNase treatment [22]. These observations suggested that someplant-based miRNAs are in a stable form that can withstand notonly the preparation process, but also the digestion and circula-tion process, ensuring their regulatory activity.Several mechanisms regarding the stability of plant miRNAs havebeen suggested:1. 2 -O-Methylation in plant miRNAs enhances their stability by protecting them from exonucleolytic digestion and uridylation[40,41];2. Stabilization of circulating miRNAs is associated with RNA- binding proteins such as Argonaute (AGOs) [42 -44] exosomes, microvesicles, and high- density lipoprotein protect miRNAs from degradation [38,46,47]; 4. The unique sequence and GC content of a plant miRNA also in- fluences its stability [22]; 5. Some plant extracts and secondary metabolitess such as ex- tracts which may protect from the enzymatic en-vironment of the digestive tract; 6. The lipid, proteins, or polysaccharides presented in plants may protect miRNAs or miRNA carriers from degradation duringpreparation and processing. Oral Delivery of Plant miRNAs ! Oral application is the dominant route of application for herbalpreparations. Even if they are stable during preparation and di-gestion processes, could these exogenous miRNAs cross biologi-cal barriers? Despite increasing efforts, the mechanisms of func-tional transfer of plant miRNAs to cross the intestinal barrier re-main unclear. Given the instability of naked RNA, it would bepossible that miRNAs in plant materials are packaged into pro-tein complexes and/or lipid vesicles and recognized by a mam-malian transport system. Several mechanisms for the intestinalpermeability of exogenous miRNAs have been proposed:1. The RNA-containing complexes are internalized into the intes- tinal epithelia and become engulfed exosomes. Some with endosomes and undergo transcytosis thattransports macromolecules from one side to the other side ofa biological barrier, while some other fused endosomes matureinto lysosomes and undergo degradation [52,53]. 2. The RNA carriers might be transferred through M cells in Peyer s patches of the intestine to macrophages or/and cells in the gut-associated lymphoid immune cells contribute to the subsequent distributionof RNA-containing complexes throughout the body [54,55]. 3. Plant miRNAs packaged within exosome-like nanoparticles could be taken up by intestinal stem cells or macrophageswhere they may exert biological functions [37,38]. 4. Although naked plant miRNAs are instable and may survive only for a few hours [19], it is possible that these unprotectedmiRNAs are uptaken into cytoplasm by receptor-mediatedendocytosis or transporters [52 -56]. 5. Additionally, altered intestinal permeability resulting from GI tract diseases, stress, malnutrition as well as folk remediesmay enhance the uptake of foreign miRNAs [23,55]. Considering that the uptake of plant miRNAs in mammals is notnecessarily related to the abundance of miRNAs in the plants [19,24], there might exist a class of plant miRNAs or miRNA carrierswith specific signatures that are recognized and preferentiallytaken up by the mammalian GI tract. After crossing the intestinalbarrier, plant miRNAs or miRNA carriers might be repacked intomicrovesicles and delivered to different tissues/cells where themiRNAs modulate the expression of their target genes [19,22].1156 Xie W et al. MicroRNAs as New ...Planta Med 2016; 82: 1153 -1162Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. In mammalian organisms, proteins at the surface of miRNA-con- taining lipid vesicles take part in the target-specific internaliza-tion into cells, such as exosome while integrins, proteoglycans, and lectin receptorproteins on the surface of recipient cells may serve as receptorsfor the exosome uptake [57]. However, the molecules on theplant miRNA carriers responsible for the interaction with themammalian GI tract as well as the target cells have not been elu-cidated.It is necessary to mention that not all the ingested miRNAs endup in the bloodstream with potential functions. The level of exog-enous miRNA matters to their biological function. It is generallyconsidered that a threshold concentration of 100 copies per cellis required for miRNAs to execute their function [22]. From thepublished data, although some plant-derived miRNAs (e.g.,miR160 a, miR162 a, and miR390 a) are detected in human serum[19], they may not be biologically active. miRNAs in Medicinal Plants ! Identification of plant miRNAs is the prerequisite for the under-standing of their functions. Genetic and computational ap-proaches are usually used for the investigation of miRNAs. Basedon the publically available genome sequence or expressed se-quence tags (ESTs), computational methods have been used forthe prediction of evolutionary conserved plant miRNAs amongdifferent species. However, except for -61], limited genomic data are available for medicinal plants. With the recent advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology, characterization ofmiRNAs through sRNA, transcriptome, sequencinghas become a routine tool for miRNA research.According to our current knowledge, a total of 44 medicinalplants with identified miRNAs are available in PubMed, ScienceScope, and miRase databases ( \"Table 2 ). With the aid of compu- tational approaches, the functions of plant miRNA have been pre-dicted. They are involved in various plant biological processes, in-cluding plant growth development, signal transduction, andstress responses [62 -66]. Secondary metabolites have generally been considered as the pharmacological active compounds inmedicinal plants, and the role of miRNAs in regulating the pro-duction of bioactive secondary metabolites has gained highattention [67 -71]. It is noteworthy that even the efficacy of some herb remedies[e.g., Viscum album L. (Santalaceae) or Vitex agnus-castus L. (Lamiaceae) has been clinically demonstrated, though the scien-tific explanation of their pharmacological activities are not con-vincing from the experimental data about concentration, phar-macological activity, bioavailability, and metabolism of second-ary metabolites present in the used extracts. One possibility toexplain this gap might be the diversification of the bioactive sub-stances. Besides the well-known plant secondary products,miRNAs produced by the mother plant may also serve as a medi-ator between botanicals and health-associated processes. A fewstudies demonstrated the therapeutics effects of herb-derivedmiRNAs in mammalian diseases and infections, such as cancerand influenza [22,24,34,35].Characterization of mammalian target genes of medicinal plantmiRNAs using computational and experimental approachesmight be a practical way for identifying functional miRNAs. Four features are commonly used for the computational recognition ofmiRNA targets [72]:1. Base-pairing between the \"seed \"(the first 2 -8 nucleotides starting at the 5 end and counting toward the 3 end of a ma- ture miRNA) and its target gene; 2. Low free energy (a negative change in overall free energy dur- ing a reaction) is expected of the authentic miRNA target pairs; 3. An optional rule for target prediction requires cross-species conservation of the putative binding sites; 4. Site accessibility is an additional rule to measure the ease with which an miRNA can locate and hybridize with an mRNA tar-get. Using these criterions, it is not surprising to identify the mamma-lian targets of herbal miRNAs, while approximately 50 humangenes were identified as putative targets of MIR168 a [19]. l \"Ta- ble 2 summarizes the currently known miRNAs from medicinal plants (more information such as traditional use/clinical impor-tance and the main bioactive ingredients of these medicinalplants is supplied in Table S1 , Supporting Information), and iden- tification of their potential mammalian targets can be a promis-ing starting point for their cross-kingdom regulatory effects stud-ies. The following up of experimental evidence is required to val-idate computational predictions since the algorithms based onthe physical properties of miRNA regulation may generate manyfalse positive results [73]. On the other hand, bioinformatics toolswith additional and more sophisticated analysis allowing moreaccurate identification of corresponding mRNA targets for theseherbal miRNAs need to be developed. Conclusions and Outlook ! Secondary metabolites serve as bioactive components in medici-nal plants, however, the experimental evidence is not convincingregarding their therapeutic effects. It is now documented that theeukaryotic organism of different kingdoms could exchangemiRNAs as signals affecting gene expression, indicating the pos-sibility that miRNAs act as a new bioactive component in herbalremedies. The potential of herbal medicine-derived miRNAs inregulating human health or targeting genes associated with dis-eases are at a very early, exploratory stage. Conclusive validationstudies are urgently needed to address this issue. It is necessaryto evaluate the stability of herbal miRNAs during the preparationand digestion processes, and in what forms these miRNAs ex-isted. If and to what extent plant-derived miRNAs are absorbedby mammals needs to be investigated. Furthermore, the mecha-nisms of intestinal absorption, tissue recognition, bioavailability,and function of herbal miRNAs should be established. Given thesecondary metabolites presented in herbal preparations, futurestudies will determine if and how these secondary metabolitesinfluence the stability and uptake of exogenous miRNAs by mam-mals.Health regulation by herbal miRNAs is a new concept with a widerange of putative applications, which may include artificial syn-thesis of therapeutic plant-derived miRNAs that might possesslower side effects, artificially loading miRNAs into plant materialsto enhance their in vivo efficacy, and discovery of novel therapeu- tic target genes. Continuing pursuit in this nascent area will notonly broaden our understanding of biological actions of herbalremedies, but also open the ways for the development of new ap-proaches to prevent or treat human diseases.1157 Xie W et al.
