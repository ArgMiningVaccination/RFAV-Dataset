The 5 day detox is chosen to suit your schedule. PRASAD Ayurveda Detox is an excellent option for those that want to experience a mini panchakarma (body cleansing) or are unable to participate in a full panchakarma program. Virechana (therapeutic purgation) is included in the process. During this five day detox, PRASAD herbal ghee is eaten daily to help pull fat soluble toxins out of the cells and triggers fat metabolism, a process where the body starts to burn its own fat for fuel. Fat soluble toxins are more difficult to remove than water soluble toxins, as water soluble toxins are generally flushed out with urine. Therefore this detox is more effective than a juice detox. Rejuvenative herbs are infused with ghee in order to quickly and evenly deliver herbal healing deep into the body's lipid-based cell walls. In Ayurveda, ghee is used as a delivery vehicle for herbs and the infusion is also delivered into the seven tissue layers of the body where the toxins are hard. The herbal ghee loosens and breaks up toxins. Finally, a special oil is carefully prescribed to flush out the toxins. Ghee cleansing has been shown to remove up to 94% of old toxic bile from the body. It boosts metabolism, keeps the colon clean, and helps in maintaining a healthy gut. This Tri-Doshic formula is suitable for all doshas and body types. ONLY ORGANIC INGREDIENTS: Handmade grass fed ghee, organic herbs. Herbal ghee available in limited quantities. No recommended for pregnancy or nursing. The receipt message includes: 30 page.pdf in English. Basic instructions in Finnish available upon request. The class is mandatory for first time detoxing.
