Cancer killed a 14-year-old girl who died shortly after being given Cervarix as part of a national immunization program. Early reports speculated that there may have been a link between the shot and her death, but according to a coroner's assessment, there was no indication that the culprit was the HPV vaccine, which is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline. The girl's death was caused by malignant disease in the heart and lungs, according to the coroner's report. Nevertheless, the UK immunization program was suspended. Other girls who received Cervarix complained of dizziness and nausea but they did not require hospitalization for their symptoms. GlaxoSmithKline recalled the batch of vaccine that included the dose administered to the deceased girl. The company's plan to launch Cervarix as a competitor to Merck's Gardasil in the U.S. was recently delayed after the FDA requested more time to review the application. "}
