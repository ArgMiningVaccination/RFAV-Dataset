Appendix A (01 -22) Surprise Billing \u2014 Know your rights Beginning January 1, 2020, Colorado state law protects you from \"surprise billing .\" This is sometimes called \"balance billing\" and it may happen when you receive covered services, other than ambulance services, from an out -of-network provider in Colorado. This law does not apply to all health plans and may not apply to out- of-network pr oviders located outside of Colorado. Check to see if you have a \"CO -DOI\" on your ID card; if not, this law may not apply to your health plan. What is surprise/balance billing and when does it happen? You are responsible for the cost -sharing amounts required by your health plan, including copayments, deductibles , and/or coinsurance. If you are seen by a provider or use services in a hospital or other type of facility that are not in your health plan's network, you may have to pay additional costs associated with that care. These providers or services at hospitals and other facilities are sometimes referred to as \"out -of-network .\" Out-of-network hospitals, facilities , or providers often bill you the difference between what Kaiser Permanente decides is the eligible charge and what the out -of-network provider bills as the total charge. This is called \" surprise\" or \"balance\" billing. When you CANNOT be balance -billed: Emergency Services When you receive services for emergency medical care, usual ly the most you can be billed for emergency services is your plan's in -network cost -sharing amounts, which are copayments, deductibles, and/or coinsurance. You cannot be balance- billed for any other amount. This includes both the emergency facility and any providers you may see for emergency care. Non- emergency Services at an In- Network or Out -of-Network Facility The hospital or facility must tell you if you are at an out -of-network location or at an in- network location that is using out - of-network providers. It must also tell you what types of services may be provided by any out -of-network provider. You have the right to request that in -network providers perform all covered medical services. However, you may have to receive medical se rvices from an out -of-network provider if an in -network provider is not available. When this happens, the most you can be billed for covered services is your in -network cost -sharing amount (copayments, deductibles, and/or coinsurance). These providers cannot balance bill you. Additional Protections Kaiser Permanente will pay out -of-network providers and facilities directly. Again, you are responsible only for paying your in- network cost -sharing for covered services. Kaiser Permanente will count any amount you pay for emergency services or certain out -of-network services (described above) toward your in -network deductible and out -of-pocket limit. Your provider, hospital, or facility must refund any amount you overpay within 60 days of y our reporting the overpayment to them. A provider, hospital, or other type of facility cannot ask you to limit or give up these rights. If you receive services from an out -of-network provider, hospital , or facility in any OTHER situation, you may still be balance- billed, or you may be responsible for the entire bill. If you intentionally receive non -emergency services from an out -of-network provider or facility, you may also be balance- billed. If you do receive a bill for amounts other than your co payments, deductibles , and/or coinsurance, please contact us at the number on your ID card, or the Division of Insurance at 303-894-7490 or 1-800-930-3745 (TTY 711) . Ambulance Information: You may be balance- billed for emergency ambulance services you receive if the ambulance service provider is a publicly funded fire agency, but state law against balance billing does apply to private companies that are not publicly funded fire agencies. Non -emergency ambulance services, such as ambulance transport betw een hospitals, are not subject to the state law against balance billing, so if you receive such services and they are not a service covered by Kaiser Permanente, you may receive a balance bill. 60577108_ACA_1557_MarCom_CO_2017_Taglines NONDISCRIMINATION NOTICE Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Colorado (Kaiser Health Plan) complies with applicable Federal civil rights laws and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, disability, or sex.

There may be times when you or a family member may receive Emergency Services from Out -of-Plan Providers. The patient's medical condition may be so critical that you cannot call or come to one of our Plan Facilities or the emergency room of a Plan Hospital, or the patient may need Emergency Services while traveling outside our Service Area. When you receive Emergency Services from Out -of-Plan Providers, Post Stabilization Care may qualify as Emergency Services pursuant to federal law. We will not require pr ior Authorization for such Post Stabilization Care at a non- Plan Hospital when your attending Out -of-Plan Provider determines that, after you receive Emergency (screening and stabilization) Services, you are not able to travel using nonmedical transportati on or nonemergency medical transportation to an available Plan Provider located within a reasonable travel distance taking into account your medical condition. Out-of-Plan Providers may provide notice and seek your consent to provide Post Stabilization Car e Services or other covered Services. Such Services will not be covered when you do not obtain prior Authorization as described herein. If you (or your authorized representative) consent to the furnishing of Services by Out -of-Plan Providers, then you wil l be responsible for paying for such Services in the absence of any prior Authorization. In addition, if you (or your authorized representative) consent to the provision of Services by an Out -of-Plan Provider, then we will not pay for such Services, and the amount you pay will not count toward satisfaction of the Deductible, if any, or the Out -of-Pocket Maximum(s).

B. Inside our Service Area .

If our contract with any Plan Provider terminates while you are under the care of that provider, we will retain financial responsibility for covered Services you receive from that provider, in excess of any applicable Deductibles, Copayments or Coinsurance amounts, until we make arrangements for the Services to be provided by another Plan Provider and so noti fy the Subscriber. For Emergency Services (including Post Stabilization Care that federal law defines as Emergency Services) provided by an Out -of-Plan Provider, your Deductible, Copayment and/or Coinsurance, as applicable, will be the same amount or perce ntage, as applicable, as they would be for Emergency Services provided by a Plan Provider pursuant to applicable state law or, if state law is inapplicable , then federal law.

Premium s A. Payment of Premiums Premiums must be paid and received in advance. You must then pay the correct amount before the beginning of a month to have coverage for that month. If you do not pay in time, we will send you a notice that you are in default. You then have a grace period in which to pay your Premiums without loss of membership. If you do not pay within the grace period , we will terminate your membership.

Only Members for whom we have received the correct amount are entitled to benefits under this Membership Agreement. B. Advance Payment of Premium Tax Credit If we receive advance payment of the premium tax credi t on your behalf, then you are responsible for paying the portion of the Premium s that equals the full Premium s minus the advance payment of the premium tax credit that we receive on your behalf for the months for which Premiums are payable. If we do not r eceive your portion of the monthly Premium s on time, we will provide a three- month grace period but only if applicable law requires a three -month grace period when: 1. We have previously received the full monthly Premiums for you (including advance payment of the premium tax credit) during the immediately preceding policy year; OR 2. We receive or will receive advance payment of the premium tax credit on your behalf for the month for which we do not receive your portion of the Premiums on time during this policy year if you were not enrolled in Health Plan during the preceding policy year .

Pre-Service Claims and Appeals Pre-service claims are requests that we provide or pay for a Service that you have not yet received. Failure to receive Authorization before receiving a Service that must be authorized or pre- certified in order to be a covered Service may be the basis for our denial of your pre -service claim . If you receive any of the Services you are requesting before we make our decision, your pre -service claim or appeal will become a post -service claim or appeal with respect to those Services. If you have any general questions about pre -service claims or app eals, please call Member Services .

You must either mail or fax your claim to Member Services . If you want us to consider your pre -service claim on an urgent basis, your request should tell us that. We will decide whether your claim is urgent or non- urgent unless your attending health care provider tells us your claim is urgent . If we determine that your claim is not urgent, we will treat your claim as non -urgent . Generally, a claim i s urgent only if using the procedure for non- urgent claims (a) could seriously jeopardize your life, health, or ability to regain maximum function or if you have a physical or mental disability , creates an imminent and substantial limitation on your existi ng ability to live independently; or (b) would, in the opinion of a physician with knowledge of your medical condition, subject you to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the Services you are requesting. We may, but are not required to, w aive the requirements related to an urgent claim and appeal, to permit you to pursue an expedited external review . We will review your claim and, if we have all the information we need, we will make a decision within a reasonable period of time but not la ter than 15 days after we receive your claim. We may extend the time for making a decision for an additional 15 days if circumstances beyond our control delay our decision, so long as we notify you prior to the expiration of the initial 15 day period and e xplain the circumstances for which we need the extra time and when we expect to make a decision . If we tell you we need more information, we will ask you for the information within 15 days of receiving your claim , and we will give you 45 days to send the i nformation. We will make a decision within 15 days after we receive the first piece of information (including documents) we requested. We encourage you to send all the requested information at one time, so that we will be able to consider all of the inform ation that you send us when we make our decision. If we do not receive any of the requested information (including documents) within 45 days after we send our request, we will make a decision based on the information we have within 15 days following the end of the 45 day period. We will send written notice of our decision to you and, if applicable to your provider . Please let us know if you wish to have our decision sent to your provider. If your pre -service claim was considered on an urgent basis, we will notify you of our decision (whether adverse or not) orally or in writing within a timeframe appropriate to your clinical condition but not later than 72 hours after we receive your claim . Within 24 hours after we receive your claim, we may ask you for more information . We will notify you of our decision within 48 hours of receiving the first piece of requested information. If we do not receive any of the requested information, then we will notify you of our decision within 48 hours after making our request . If we notify you of our decision orally, we will send you written confirmation within three ( 3) days after that. If we deny your claim (if we do not agree to provide or pay for all the Services you requested), our adverse benefit determination notice will tell you why we denied your claim and how you can appeal. b.
