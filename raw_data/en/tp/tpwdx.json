A good portion of mine came from the stash I collect behind my local 'Kidstuff' or the supermarket. I have also been known to stop my neighbours on their way to the recycling bin with boxes. That's just how I roll. The jewels are on the inside and packed with so much love!! And just in case you are wondering - any bubble wrap used is all recycled too. I recycle. I reuse. when I can Carbon Neutral Parcel Delivery The process of delivering a parcel emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is shown to harm our environment. We are using Australia Post and Sendle for our shipping delivery Plastic-free Packaging that turns into fertiliser HERE IS WHY I LOVE THEM... WHAT ARE THEY MADE FROM? Unlike traditional shipping mailers, these are NOT made from single use plastic. Our mailers are made from 30% plant-based materials such as PLA and 70% from a certified compostable material called PBAT (a synthetic bonding agent). ANOTHER COOL TIP - YOU CAN REUSE THEM AGAIN There are 2 sticky strips, so when you receive the mailer, you can cut along the line on the flap and re-use it with the second adhesive (glue) strip. HERO mailers are one of the only ones in the world that have a reusable strip! HOW DO YOU COMPOST THE MAILERS? To compost them at home, it's best to remove any labels ( unless they too are compostable), cut them up and place them in your compost bin. These will completely break down within 90-120 days in a home-compostable environment - sometimes even sooner!
