(75 FR 9674) In that rulemaking, EPA establishe d a definition for resi dential/commercial/ institutional emergency stationary RICE. Subse quent to the publication of the final rule, EPA received numerous questions regarding the defi nition and whether certai n types of facilities would meet the definition. In order to provide additional clarification, EPA is separating the definition into individual definitions for resi dential emergency stationary RICE, commercial emergency stationary RICE, and institutional emer gency stationary RICE, and is also providing additional examples of the types of facilities th at would be included under those categories in the definitions in the rule. The definitions are as follows: Residential emergency stationary RICE means an emergency stationary RICE used in residential establishments such as homes or apartment buildings. Commercial emergency stationary RICE means an emergency stationary RICE used in commercial establishments such as office buildings , hotels, stores, teleco mmunications facilities, restaurants, financial institutions such as banks , doctor's offices, and sports and performing arts facilities. Institutional emergency stationary RICE means an emergency stationary RICE used in institutional establishments such as medical cente rs, nursing homes, research centers, institutions of higher education, correctional f acilities, elementary and secondary schools, libraries, religious establishments, police sta tions, and fire stations. In order to give further guidan ce regarding the types of facilities that would be considered residential, commercial, or institutional, EPA has provided a list of NAICS codes in Appendix A and indicated for each code whether the establishment would be considered residential, commercial, or institutional. 2 Appendix A 2007 NAICS Code 2007 NAICS 111110 No 111120 Oilseed (except Soybean) Farming No 111130 Dry Pea and Bean Farming No 111140 Wheat Farming No 111150 Corn Farming No 111160 Rice Farming No 111191 Oilseed and Grain Combination Farming No 111199 All Other Grain Farming No 111211 Potato Farming No 111219 Other Vegetable (except Potato) and Melon Farming No 111310 Orange Groves No 111320 Citrus (except Orange) Groves No 111331 Apple Orchards No 111332 Grape Vineyards No 111333 Strawberry Farming No 111334 Berry (except Strawberry) Farming No 111335 Tree Nut Farming No 111336 Fruit and Tree Nut Combination Farming No 111339 Other Noncitrus Fruit Farming No 111411 Mushroom Production No 111419 Other Food Crops Grown Under Cover No 111421 Nursery and Tree Production No 111422 Floriculture Production No 111910 Tobacco Farming No 111920 Cotton Farming No 111930 Sugarcane Farming No 111940 Hay Farming No 111991 Sugar Beet Farming No 111992 Peanut Farming No 111998 All Other Miscellaneous Crop Farming No 112111 Beef Cattle Ranching and Farming No 112112 Cattle Feedlots No 112120 Dairy Cattle and Milk Production No 112130 Dual-Purpose Cattle Ranching and Farming No 112210 Hog and Pig Farming No 112310 Chicken Egg Production No 112320 Broilers and Other Meat Type Chicken Production No 112330 Turkey Production No 112340 Poultry Hatcheries No 112390 Other Poultry Production No 112410 Sheep Farming No 112420 Goat Farming No 3 2007 Code 2007 NAICS Residential/ No 112519 Other Aquaculture No 112910 Apiculture No 112920 Horses and Other Equine Production No 112930 Fur-Bearing Animal and Rabbit Production No 112990 All Other Animal Production No 113110 Timber Tract Operations No 113210 Forest Nurseries and Gathering of Forest Products No 113310 Logging No 114111 Finfish Fishing No 114112 Shellfish Fishing No 114119 Other Marine Fishing No 114210 Hunting and Trapping No 115111 Cotton Ginning No 115112 Soil Preparation, Planting, and Cultivating No 115113 Crop Harvesting, Primarily by Machine No 115114 Postharvest Crop Activities (except Cotton Ginning) No 115115 Farm Labor Contractors and Crew Leaders No 115116 Farm Management Services No 115210 Support Activities for Animal Production No 115310 Support Activities for Forestry No 211111 Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas Extraction No 211112 Natural Gas Liquid Extraction No 212111 Bituminous Coal and Lignite Surface Mining No 212112 Bituminous Coal Underground Mining No 212113 Anthracite Mining No 212210 Iron Ore Mining No 212221 Gold Ore Mining No 212222 Silver Ore Mining No 212231 Lead Ore and Zinc Ore Mining No 212234 Copper Ore and Nickel Ore Mining No 212291 Uranium-Radium-Vanadium Ore Mining No 212299 All Other Metal Ore Mining No 212311 Dimension Stone Mining and Quarrying No 212312 Crushed and Broken Limestone Mining and Quarrying No 212313 Crushed and Broken Granite Mining and Quarrying No 212319 Other Crushed and Broken Stone Mining and Quarrying No 212321 Construction Sand and Gravel Mining No 212322 Industrial Sand Mining No 212324 Kaolin and Ball Clay Mining No 212325 Clay and Ceramic and Refractory Minerals Mining No 212391 Potash, Soda, and Borate Mineral Mining No 212392 Phosphate Rock Mining No 212393 Other Chemical and Fertilizer Mineral Mining No 4 2007 NAICS Code 2007 NAICS Title Residential/ Institutional/ Commercial?
