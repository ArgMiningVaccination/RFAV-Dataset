MILLER CONFIRMS THAT THERE IS NO COMPETENT AND RELIABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE THE CLAIMS THAT DCO'S PRODUCTS TREAT. CURE. OR PREVENT CANCER Introduction 172. Denis R. Miler, M.D. is a board-certified pediatric hematologist/oncologist. S.D. Ex. 1 Complaint Counsel's Expert Denis R. Miler, M.D., dated Februar 18, (Declaration of 2009, attaching Denis R. Miler, M.D. Expert Report (hereinafter referred to as D. Miler Expert Report) at 1). 22 173. For over 40 years, Dr. Miler has directed clinical care, education, laboratory and clinical research, and administration, heading divisions or departments at University of Rochester Medical Center, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Northwestern University Medical SchooL. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 1). 174. Dr. Miler also has served as Associate Medical Director of Cancer Treatment Centers of America (\"CTCA\") as well as Scientific Director ofCTCA's Cancer Treatment Research Foundations. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 1). 175. As Scientific Director, Dr. Miler supervised the clinical research program and was principal investigator for a number of Phase I/II clinical studies involving treatments for hematological malignancies and cancers of the head and neck, lung, breast, pancreas, and colon. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 1-2). 176. Dr. Miler has authored or co-authored over 300 book chapters, peer-reviewed aricles, and abstracts, and has served on the editorial boards of the British Journal of Hematology and the American Journal of Clinical Oncology. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 3). 177. Dr. Miler currently is the Oncology/Hematology Therapeutic Area Leader at P AREXEL International, a leading contract research organization, where he manages clinical trals for the pharaceutical industry. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 2). 178. To constitute competent and reliable scientific evidence, a product that purorts to treat, cure, or prevent cancer must have its efficacy and safety demonstrated through controlled clinical studies. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 7). 179. Only data from well-designed, controlled, clinical trials wil substantiate claims that a new therapy is safe and effective to treat, cure, or prevent cancer. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 30). 180. Anecdotal reports of product efficacy are the weakest form of evidence supporting the anticancer activity of a new agent. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 12). 181. Testimonials do not substitute for a well-designed clinical trial in proving the effcacy of a supposed cancer fighting product. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 30). 182. Dr. Miler's thorough review of peer-reviewed literature and all of the documents produced by DCO indicates that there is no competent and reliable scientific evidence that the DCa Products are effective either alone or in combination with other DCO products in the treatment or cure of cancer, in inhibiting tumor formation, and in preventing the destrctive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 31). 23 Bio*Shark 183. Dr. Miler's review of the peer-reviewed literature and all of the documents Respondents submitted as substantiation indicates that there was no competent and reliable scientific evidence that Bio*Shark inhibits tumor growth in humans or that it is effective in the treatment of cancer in humans. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 13). 184. Dr. Miler found that there were no adequate and well-controlled studies demonstrating that Bio*Shark is antiangiogenic or is effective in the treatment of cancer, and even supporting non-clinical studies of crude or parially-purified shark cartilage products were extremely limited, paricularly with regard to mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, pharacodynamics, and dose response. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 17). 185. Dr. Miler observed that Respondents' reliance on Dr. 1. Wiliam Lane's book, \"Sharks Don't Get Cancer\" was misplaced, as studies at Johns Hopkins University indicate that sharks do indeed get cancer. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 16). 7 Herb Formula 186. Dr. Miler's review of the peer-reviewed literatue and all of the documents Respondents submitted as substantiation indicates that there was no competent and reliable scientific evidence that 7 Herb Formula inhibits tumor formation and is effective in the treatment or cure of cancer in humans. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 18). 187. Dr. Miler found neither non-clinical nor clinical studies supporting claims that 7 Herb Formula or any of its individual ingredients are effective anticancer agents or inhibit tumor formation. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 19). 188. Any relevant studies on the ingredients Burdock root, Cat's Claw, sheep sorrel, slippery elm bark, turkish rhubarb root, Siberian ginseng, and watercress were performed either in vitro or on animals, not on humans with cancer. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 19-22). GDU 189. Dr. Miler's review of the peer-reviewed literature and all of the documents Respondents submitted as substantiation indicates that there was no competent and reliable scientific evidence that GDU eliminates tumors and is effective in the treatment of cancer in humans. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 22). 190. Dr. Miler found no randomized, controlled clinical trals of any of the individual components of GDU or of GDU itself in patients with cancer. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 27). 24 191. Dr. Miler, however, did note that curcumin (tumeric), one ofGDU's ingredients, is currently being evaluated in controlled clinical trials to determine its potential as a chemoprotective and cancer preventive agent. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 22). 192. Animal studies have suggested that curcumin may have activity as a cancer preventive and therapeutic agent. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 23). 193. Nevertheless, Dr. Miler cautioned that some studies have suggested that curcumin may actually inhibit the anticancer activity of some approved anticancer agents as well as exacerbate iron deficiency. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 27). 194. Thus, Dr. Miler advised that further research on curcumin was necessary. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 27). BioMix 195. Dr. Miller's review of the peer-reviewed literature and all of the documents Respondents submitted as substantiation indicates that there was no competent and reliable scientific evidence that BioMixx is effective in the treatment of cancer and heals the destrctive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 27). 196. Dr. Miler found that there are no reported studies of either BioMixx or its constituent ingredients being effective in the treatment of cancer. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 27-28). 197. Dr. Miler also found \"absolutely no data\" to support the claim that BioMixx is used to heal the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 29). H. RESPONDENTS' EXPERTS DO NOT POSSESS ANY INFORMATION SUBSTANTIATING RESPONDENTS' CLAIMS Introduction James Duke. Ph.D. 198. James Duke, Ph.D. (\"Duke\") has never met Jim and Patricia Feijo. Deposition of James Duke, Ph.D. (hereinafter referred to as Duke Dep. Tr.) at 8, 1. 6-9. 199. Duke is not a medical doctor. Duke Dep. Tr. at 56, 1. 3-5. 200. Duke is not licensed to practice medicine in any state. Duke Dep. Tr. at 56, 1. 6-8. 201. Duke is not a board-certified oncologist. Duke Dep. Tr. at 56, 1. 9-10. 25 202. Duke does not recall ever publishing any aricles in any peer-reviewed medical journals. Duke Dep. Tr. at 56, 1. 11-14. 203. Duke has never practiced medicine. Duke Dep. Tr. at 18, 1. 8. 204. Duke would not recommend that people self-medicate with herbal remedies in treating cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 135,1. 17-22. 205. Duke is sure that there is a risk that some people wil pursue herbal medications instead of effective pharmaceutical medications and thereby die. Duke Dep. Tr. at 136,1. 20-23. 206. Duke does not recall any holistic physicians who have consulted with him on the treatment of cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 19, 1. 10-13. 207. Duke does not recall any homeopaths who have consulted with him on the treatment of cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 19,1. 14-17. 208. Duke has never managed or participated in any studies to measure the efficacy of an herb in treating cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 29,1. 15-22. 209. Duke does not remember ever being a consultant on a study where the anticancer effects of an herb were being measured on a group of patients. Duke Dep. Tr. at 29,1. 23-25 \u00ad 30, 1. 1-2. 210. Duke does not remember seeing the FTC's Complaint against Respondents. Duke Dep. Tr. at 36, 1. 19-22. 211. Duke has no knowledge of any of the advertisements that the FTC has challenged as the predicate for the Complaint. Duke Dep. Tr. at 36,1. 23-25 - 37, 1. 1-2. 212. Duke was not sent any of Respondents' products. Duke Dep. Tr. at 37,1. 3-5. 213. Duke has not spoken to any persons who have taken DCa products for the treatment of cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 38, 1. 23-25. 214. Duke has not reviewed the medical records of anyone who claims to have taken DCa products for the treatment of cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 39,1. 1-4. 215. Duke had never heard of DCa until this case. Duke Dep. Tr. at 39, 1. 9-10. 216. Duke has never listened to the DCa Radio program. Duke Dep. Tr. at 39, 1. 11-14. 26 217. Duke knows of no tests where the patient prays and one group of patients gets a Biblically referenced herb and the other group of patient prays and gets an allopathic treatment. Duke Dep. Tr. at 41,1. 20-25 - 42, 1. 1-2. 218. Duke does not think that \"the FDA permits advertising for cancer unless clinically proven.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 46,1. 19-22. 219. Duke's \"Multiple Activity Menus\" (\"MAMs\") are an attempt to identify herbs that show promise in fighting disease. Duke Dep. Tr. at 91, 1. 20-23. 220. The MAM and the ratio that it yields does not prove that anyone ofthese herbs is effective in fighting or treating cancer. Rather, \"(i)t adds a listing of the chemicals in that herb that have been shown or assumed to help with cancer.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 92, 1. 5-11. 221. When entering in the MAM an activity for an herb, Duke only enters references to that source \"as it maybe a good source (or) it maybe a bad source.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 93, 1. 8-13. 222. Duke acknowledged that it is a \"gut feeling\" on how he makes sure that the studies he references in the MAMs are reliable. Duke Dep. Tr. at 108,1. 17-21. 223. Duke acknowledged that his MAMs have not been cited in any peer-reviewed journaL Duke Dep. Tr. at 113,1. 2-4. 224. Duke explained that his Indication Evaluations (\"IE\") is where he has \"gone through all these abstracts over the years (and) I've scored for a given indication. If it's folklore and that's all I have, it would receive an 't; ifit has a chemical or an epidemiological or an animal or an in vitro evidence, I've given it a 1; and then the 2, as we mentioned earlier, that means it's either been clinically approved - - an extract of the plant has been clinically approved or it's been approved by the Commission E or the Tramil Commission for that indication. These are lines of evidence that point to me which ones are most important and should be studied for cancer.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 59,1. 7-21; 118, 1. 10-13; 7-9. The IE \"compendium of information.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 109,1. 8-10. 226. There is no relationship between the MAMs and the IE. Duke Dep. Tr. at 92,1. 12-20. 227. Neither the MAMs nor the IE reflect information that indicates that turmeric, for example, is effective in the treatment of cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 109, 1. 25 - 110, 1. 1-6. 228. Duke has never measured the effcacy of herbs as a treatment for cancer in a controlled patient population. Duke Dep. Tr. at 55, 1. 21-24. 27 229. Duke is not able to express opinions on what the minimum dosage would be necessar to achieve cancer-fighting. Duke Dep. Tr. at 67, 1. 24-25 - 68, 1. 1. 230. Duke recognizes the difference between something being efficacious in an in vitro study and something being efficacious in human beings. Duke Dep. Tr. at 71,1. 20-24. 231. As a matter of science, Duke does not believe that the herbal extract working in vitro proves that it would work in a human. Duke Dep. Tr. at 77, 1. 10-24. 232. Rather than relying solely on in vitro studies, Duke recommends \"the third arm-tral where the whole plant or an extract thereof is compared with a competing pharaceuticaL\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 77, 1. 17-24. 233. According to Duke, \"(t)he third ar would compare a given herb with a given pharmaceutical and placebo.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 81, 1. 17-23. 234. Other than the St. John's Wort trial that used a placebo and Zoloft, Duke is not aware of any other studies where an herb, a pharaceutical, and a placebo were studied in a side- by-side manner. Duke Dep. Tr. at 82, 1. 1-17. 235. Duke does not think of black cohosh as a major anticancer herb. Duke Dep. Tr. at 123,1. 5-13. 236. Duke stated that there is no reference to cancer in eleuthero because \"that's not one ofthe major things that are said about it.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 125,1. 23-25 - 126,1. 1-2. 237. Most of the studies Duke has seen have been for preventing cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 128,1. 22-24. 238. Duke does not remember any studies specifically about treating cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 128,1. 25 - 129,1. 1-3. 239. Duke testified that anecdotal reports are \"even below. . . my lines of evidence.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 131,1. 15-20. 240. Duke attributes the increase in life expectancy in the 150 years that pharaceuticals have been around to pharaceuticals themselves. Duke Dep. Tr. at 133,1. 9-15. 241. Duke does not believe that homeostatic balancing has been the subject of any peer- reviewed articles in connection with the treatment or cure of cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 133,1. 25 - 134,1. 1-12. 242. In Duke's IE, there have been no clinical trials as to the efficacy of black cohosh for cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 147,1. 8-25. 28 243. There are no clinical trials regarding garlic's efficacy as to cancer in Duke's IE. Duke Dep. Tr. at 148,1. 1-5. 244. There are no clinical trials regarding Yellow Root's efficacy as to cancer in Duke's IE. Duke Dep. Tr. at 149,1. 1-5. 245. There are no clinical trals regarding eleuthero's efficacy as to cancer in Duke's IE. Duke Dep. Tr. at 153,1. 3-7. 246. There are no clinical trials regarding soybean's efficacy as to cancer in Duke's IE. Duke Dep. Tr. at 153,1. 24-25 - 154,1. 1-7. 247. There are no entries for sarsaparilla in Duke's IE indicating that it has been evaluated for its efficacy in treating cancer in clinical trials. Duke Dep. Tr. at 156,1. 21-24. 248. The editors of Duke's book, The Green Pharmacy Guide to Healing Foods, advised Duke to \"shy away from\" a section on cancer treatment. Duke Dep. Tr. at 178, 1. 6-18. 249. Duke does not recall seeing any articles that Mr. and Mrs. Feijo believe substantiated the claims that they made regarding the paricular DCa Products. Duke Dep. Tr. at 185, 1. 7\u00ad 11. 250. Duke has made no effort to evaluate whether the combination of the ingredients in each ofthe products that DCa sells - GDU, 7 Herb Formula, and BioMixx - has any synergistic effects. Duke Dep. Tr. at 190, 1. 10-21. 251. Duke made no effort to see whether there were any studies of any sort regarding the paricular products that DCa sells - GDU, 7 Herb Formula, and BioMixx. Duke Dep. Tr. at 190, 1. 22-25 - 191,1. 1-4. James K. Dews 252. Respondents offer James K. Dews (\"Dews\") as an expert in \"(h)erbal formulations, specifically 7 Herb Formula.\" Deposition of James K. Dews (hereinafter referred to as J. Dews Dep. Tr.) at 4, 1. 25 - 5, 1. 1. 253. Dews attended the University of Texas at Arlington and Texas Wesleyan, but he did not finish college degrees at either institution. J. Dews Dep. Tr. at 11,1. 2-15. 254. According to Dews, neutraceuticals involves the merging of food supplements and pharaceuticals. J. Dews Dep. Tr. at 17,1. 25. 255. Neutraceuticals involves the extraction of certain chemical compounds that are in many foods or herbs. J. Dews Dep. Tr. at 18, 1. 14-18. 29 256. Consumers ingest neutraceuticals. J. Dews Dep. Tr. at 18, 1. 6. 257. The difference between a pharmaceutical and a neutraceutical is that one can make a disease-curing claim with a pharmaceutical; one cannot make a disease-curing claim with a neutraceutica1. J. Dews Dep. Tr. at 62, 1. 17-18; see also 15,1. 12-13. 258. According to Dews, animal studies canot be extrapolated to humans. J. Dews Dep. Tr. at 63, 1. 18-25 - 64, 1. 1-8. Rustum Rov. Ph.D. 259. Respondents offer Rustum Roy, Ph.D. (\"Roy\") as \"an expert in the conduct of scientific research and with the focus on health and materials.\" Deposition of Rustum Roy, Ph.D. (hereinafter referred to as R. Roy Dep. Tr.) at 7, 1. 5-10. 260. Roy did not review the complaint that the FTC filed against Respondents. R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 7,1. 17-21. 261.

Tr. at 13,1. 20-21. 267. Roy has not measured the efficacy of the DCa Products. R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 14,1. 2-5. 268. Roy has never done any experiments to measure the efficacy of any medical treatments \"at the human leveL\" R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 14,1. 6-9. 269. Roy has no idea what the DCO Products contain. R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 24, 1. 21-25. 270. Roy has not done any literature searches or any literature research concerning any of the ingredients in DCa's products. R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 25,1. 3-7. 271. Roy does not have any formal training in medicine. R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 26, 1. 9-11. 30 272. Roy has never treated or consulted with healers who were treating particular patients. R. Roy Dep.

The practice of Daniel Chapter One selling products over the Internet to people that it had never seen, met, or examined the medical records for \"obviously limits\" homeopathy. R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 50, 1. 5-19. 275. Roy's ideal description of homeopathy would not include selling products over the Internet to persons that the seller has not met. R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 51, 1. 11-14. 276. It is not Roy's view that all herbal remedies are effective. R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 60,1. 60, 1. 23-25 - 61, 1. 1. 277. Roy has never been involved in trng to secure FDA approval for some medication. R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 79,1. 14-16. Jav Lehr 278. No one has ever consulted Jay Lehr (\"Lehr\") about using herbs in connection with cancer. Deposition of Jay Lehr (hereinafter referred to as J. Lehr Dep. Tr.) at 10, 1. 24-25 -11,1. 1. ,279. Lehr is not a cancer expert. J. Lehr Dep. Tr. at 15,1. 11. 280.

Beyond his own personal study, Lehr has not conducted any studies on the four DCa Products. J. Lehr Dep. Tr. at 23,1. 2-5. 290. Respondent James Feijo has never suggested that Lehr take Bio*Shark, 7 Herb Formula, or BioMixx. J. Lehr Dep. Tr. at 25, 1. 5-6. 291. The products that Respondent James Feijo has suggested to Lehr \"have entirely been to improve (his) athletic performance.\" J. Lehr Dep. Tr. at 25, 1. 6-8. 292.

Lehr does not have any familiarty with Respondents' products that are being sold to help people in the treatment of cancer. J. Lehr Dep. Tr. at 28, 1. 3-6. 295. The only testing that Lehr is aware ofthat Respondent James Feijo conducted is that which he has done on PrePost and the other products that Respondent James Feijo has shared with him. J. Lehr Dep. Tr. at 28, 1. 20-22. 296. Lehr's opinion is that because PrePost works so well on him that Respondents' other products should be as effective. J. Lehr Dep. Tr. at 32,1. 21-25 - 33, 1. 1-18. 297. Lehr is familiar with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. J. Lehr Dep. Tr. at 34, 1. 6-9. 298.

Sallv B. LaMont. N.D. 307. Respondents offer Sally B. LaMont, N.D. (\"LaMont\") as \"an expert in naturopathic medical, herbal medicine, functional medicine. . . (and) as an expert on nutrtional supplements and botanical medicines in the prevention and treatment of ilness and as an expert in reviewing the evidence that supports the functional issues of the four products that are the challenged products.\" Deposition of Sally B. LaMont, N.D. (hereinafter referred to as LaMont Dep. Tr.) at 7,1. 20-25 - 8, 1. 1-2. 308. LaMont has never previously been asked to be an expert. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 54, 1. 9-12. 309. Lamont's charge from Respondents is \"to provide opinions on the use of nutritional supplements and botanical medicines in the prevention and treatment of ilness, including but not limited to cancer, and to review the evidence that exists regarding the mechanisms of action ofthe major constituents of Daniel Chapter One's products.\" LaMont Dep. Tr. at 33, 1. 13-22. 310. LaMont is a naturopathic doctor. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 9, 1. 9-11, 15,1. 23-25 - 16,1.. 311. According to LaMont, naturopathic medicine \"is a primary healthcare practice that focuses on health promotion and disease prevention and the treatment of disease with an aray of natural therapies that strengthen the body's innate healing capacities.\" LaMont Dep. Tr. at 9,1. 14-18. 312. Natuopathic doctors \"provide patient-centered care and practice what would be termed functional medicine, which addresses the unique genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors that contribute to chronic disease and. . . influence our health.\" LaMont Dep. Tr. at 9, 1. 19-24. 33 313. While engaged in naturopathic medicine, LaMont has worked in conjunction with traditional physicians. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 10,1. 2-5. 314. In the course of doing a workup on a patient, if LaMont finds \"a diagnosis that looks like it could be cancer,\" she absolutely would refer the patient to a traditional physician and would comanage that patient's care with the physician. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 10,1. 16-22. 315. LaMont has not focused her naturopathic practice on naturopathic oncology; rather, she \"ha(s) kept (her) practice very generaL\" LaMont Dep. Tr. at 11,1. 20-25 - 12,1. 1-2. 316. LaMont does not know what additional specialized training naturopathic oncologists take. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 12,1. 7-11. 317. LaMont has not done the specialized training for naturopathic oncology. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 12,1. 9-10. 318. After LaMont's first husband passed away from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, she \"chose to step back from (dealing with cancer patients) for several years.\" LaMont Dep. Tr. at 12, 1. 12-22. 319. LaMont stared practicing naturopathic medicine in 1981 and stopped in 2000 to raise her daughter and to lead the campaign to license naturopathic doctors in California. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 13,1. 8-19. 320. LaMont returned to the private practice of naturopathic medicine almost a year ago by working part-time, practicing one day a week and beginning to add a second day. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 13,1. 20-25. 321. If LaMont ever found, for example, an abnormal pap smear with carcinoma inside, then she \"would refer that patient to a gyecologist for a comprehensive workup and recommend that (her) patients follow the advice oftheir oncologist.\" LaMont Dep. Tr. at 14,1. 11-17. 322. LaMont's understanding is that \"cancer must be treated with conventional therapies.\" LaMont Dep. Tr. at 15,1. 1-4. 323. LaMont has seen conventional cancer therapies helpful in sometimes resolving the condition. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 15, 1. 1-6. 324. LaMont would always make a referral to a cancer specialist because \"it's an important par of the treatment of cancer atthis point.\" LaMont Dep. Tr. at 15,1. 12-17. 325. Fourteen states license N.D.s. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 17, 1. 3-8. 34 326.

Tr. at 17,1. 17-24. 327. The core of LaMont's practice is \"(w)orking with diet and nutrition (and) nutrtional supplements.\" LaMont Dep. Tr. at 20, 1. 1-2. 328. LaMont also uses botanical medicine. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 20,1. 7. 329. LaMont works with mind-body therapies and regularly suggests meditation, qigong, therapies that would strengthen the person's connection between their mind and their immune system. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 20,1. 7-12. yoga, and other biofeedback-type of 330. LaMont does acupuncture on most patients. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 20,1. 15. 331. Nutrtional supplements come from food and are an extension of food. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 20, 1. 22-23. 332. Botanical medicine \"comes from the plant world, and so there are phytochemicals in plants and then there's the whole plant.\" LaMont Dep. Tr. at 20,1. 24-25 - 21, 1. 1. 333. Almost all the patients who come to LaMont who have been diagnosed with cancer come to her with that diagnosis and are looking for supportive care. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 23, 1. 5-10. 334. LaMont thinks that the amount of dosage is important to the individual taking it and their health regimen. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 28,1. 11-15. 335. For someone who is in the \"throes of chemotherapy,\" LaMont would have them not to use many of their nutrtional supplements the week that they are on chemotherapy. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 31, 1. 5-9. 336. The reason why LaMont would advise someone not to use nutritional supplements during chemotherapy is because \"we don't fully understand yet all of the different ways in which this and other natural therapies may interact with chemotherapy.\" LaMont Dep. Tr. at 31, 1. 10-20. 337. LaMont only became familiar with DCa at the end of December 2008. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 22, 1. 23-25 - 23, 1. 1-4. 338.
