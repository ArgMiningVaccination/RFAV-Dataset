Naturopathy emphasizes the self-healing process of the body through natural therapies. It has roots formed in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries. This treatment uses herbal medicine, exercise, massage, acupuncture, and diet to treat ailments. The treatment works on the principle that through your body's vital energies, it can heal itself. The main goal of the treatment is to treat your whole being\u2014mind, body, and spirit. Ayurveda dates way back to 1700-1100 BC in the Indian sub-continent. This ancient system of medicine focuses on life forces (doshas), the body's constitution, and its universal interconnectedness. The basis of [Ayurveda](/ayurveda/) is that a balance in the doshas \u2014 a Vata, Pitta, and Kapha\u2014 boosts your health. An imbalance will lead to diseases. Ayurveda treatment involves internal purification, a special diet, herbal medications, yoga, and meditation. Naturopathy and Ayurveda use natural treatments to restore your body's abilities in healing itself. They recommend the use of natural foods, herbs, and activities like meditation and exercise. The use of these natural elements allows your body to remove unnatural toxins, encouraging it to self-heal. These treatments bring your body back to a healthy balanced state without any invasive surgery or synthetic remedies. This means that you don't have to worry about side effects. Ayurveda and Naturopathy specialists seek to analyze your whole body before prescribing treatment. They aim to improve your physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional being. This whole-body approach to healing aims at healing the underlying cause of the disease, instead of just the symptoms. To achieve this, a Naturopath in Melbourne may first ask questions about your health history, lifestyle, stress levels, and more. Naturopathy and Ayurveda believe that a natural diet is vital in preventing illness and increasing energy in your body. Both treatments agree that your body is made to process food that is close to nature. This means you should avoid processed foods and excess sugar to achieve balance within your body. These foods are believed to contain toxins that counter the correct balance in your body. However, Naturopathy allows for consuming organic meats and raw vegetables. Ayurveda emphasizes a vegetarian lifestyle, preferably cooked vegetables. Ayurveda treatment is the perfect alternative for naturopathy.
