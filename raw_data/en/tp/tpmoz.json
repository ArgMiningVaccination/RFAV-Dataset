A Life-changing Journey (LIFE-CHANGING JOURNEY OF GAGORI) As the co-founder of Aithein, Gagori is a highly experienced and practiced Bodywork expert. For her, the connection of the body, its senses, mind and soul is a way of life. She imparts her knowledge and philosophy with a deep understanding and through her personal experience over the years. Gagori's first introduction to massage was when she was six. In order to break the habit of bedwetting, her father referred to a Marma book, which described various pressure points of the body. Over the next two months, he applied the practices taught in the book and the problem ceased within two months. When she grew older, she would massage her father's feet and shoulders. Although Gagori did it out of fun, her father realized her ability to heal people through her hands. It was the same with her mother and sister, who suffered from severe headaches. She would easily cure them by pressing a few points on their forehead for 10-15 minutes. Charities supported by us At aithein, we do our part by supporting the local charities.
