All rights reservedAbstract Aim: We investigated the effect of early-life factors, namely sex, delivery mode, feeding method and antibiotic exposure, on antibody responses to routine vaccinations administered during the first year of life. Methods: One and seven months after the primary course of routine vaccines and one month after routine vaccines at 12 months of age, antibodies against 26 vaccine antigens were measured in 398 healthy infants. The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of antibodies (adjusted for effect modifiers with multiple linear regression) and the seroprotection rate for each vaccine were compared for each early-life factor. Results: Sex had an influence on GMCs. Antibody concentrations were significantly lower at 7 months of age in females for tetanus and filamentous haemagglutinin and at 13 months of age for pertactin. In contrast, at 13 months of age, antibody concentrations were significantly higher in females for polio type 3, pneumococccal serotype 6A and measles. Sex did not have an influence on seroprotection rates. Delivery mode, feeding method and antibiotic exposure did not exert a substantial influence on vaccine antibody concentrations. Conclusion: There is a difference between males and females in the humoral response to routine vaccinations in the first year of life. Key Notes There are substantial differences between individuals in the immune response to vaccination. In this study, we found that there are differences between males and females in antibody responses to routine vaccinations in the first year of life. In contrast, delivery mode, feeding method and antibiotic exposure does not affect antibody responses. Keywords: antibodies, humoral, immunoglobulin, titre, immunisation, infant Introduction Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedVaccination is one of the most cost-effective, life-saving medical interventions. However, there is substantial variation between individuals in the magnitude of the immune response to vaccination, which might have implications for both protective efficacy and duration of protection. At the age of six months, for example, antibody responses to pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines may vary up to 40-fold (1). A number of intrinsic host, perinatal and extrinsic factors are likely to contribute to the variation in vaccine responses (2). One of the intrinsic factors that has been most investigated is biological sex. But studies to date have almost exclusively been in adults. Other intrinsic factors include polymorphisms in genes encoding major histocompatibility complexes or pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like or RIG-like receptors (2). Perinatal factors that might influence vaccine responses include gestational age, birth weight (3, 4) and feeding method (formula vs breastfed). Potential extrinsic factors include exposure to probiotics and antibiotics. While, there is evidence for a beneficial effect of probiotics on vaccine responses (2), to date, only one study has investigated the effect of antibiotics in vaccine responses in humans. This study reported that administration of antibiotics before vaccination did not alter serum immunoglobulin (Ig) A concentrations to oral rotavirus vaccine (ORV) in adults (5). Determining the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on vaccine antibody responses has implications for optimising vaccine recommendations and individualising vaccine schedules. In this study, we investigated the effect of biological sex, mode of delivery, feeding method and antibiotic exposure on antibody responses to routine vaccinations given in the first year of life. Methods Study design and population Participants were a subset of 471 healthy infants from The Melbourne Infant Study: Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) for Allergy and Infection Reduction (MIS BAIR) (http://misbair.org). In this trial infants were recruited at birth from 2013 to 2016 and randomised to receive neonatal BCG vaccination or no intervention to investigate whether BCG protects from childhood allergies. Inclusion criteria included the following: greater than 32 weeks gestation and birth weight greater than 1500 grams. Details about feeding and antibiotic exposure were prospectively collected by parent questionnaire. Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedFrom the subset of participants whose parent/guardian provided consent, blood samples were collected at study visits at 7 and / or 13 months of age (designed to be 4 weeks after the administration of routine scheduled vaccinations). Only participants who had a blood taken 28 \u00b1 14 days after their 6-month and / or 12-month routine vaccinations were included in the analysis of immediate post-vaccination responses. For those in whom persistence of antibodies to their 6-month vaccines was measured blood was taken 7 months \u00b1 23 days after their 6-month vaccinations. Infant vaccination All infants received routine vaccinations according to the Australian National Immunisat ion Program: at H-B-Vax II Paediatric\u00ae, bioCSL)); at 6 weeks, 4 months and 6 months of age: intramuscular combined vaccine ( Menitorix\u00ae Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen ) shortly after birth as part of the MIS BAIR. Vaccine records were obtained from individual vaccination records and/or the Australian Immunisation Register. Blood collection and antibody assay Following collection ( S-monovette\u00ae (Sarstedt)), plasma was stored at -80\u00b0 C until analysis at the National Institute for Health and Environment, in Bilthoven, the Netherlands. IgG antibodies against 26 vaccine antigens (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA), pertactin (PRN)), polio (types 1, 2, 3), pneumococcus (serotypes 1, 3, 4, technology). In all assays, international or in- house reference controls and blanks were included on each plate. All analyses were performed with a Bio-Plex 200 in combination with Bio-Plex manager software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedCategorisation of participants Infants were categorised by biological sex (male or female), delivery mode (vaginal vs Caesarean section), feeding method and antibiotic exposure using information collected from hospital records and parent questionnaires. Feeding method was categorised as follows: i) infants who did or did not receive formula before leaving their birth hospital; ii) infants who were or were not still receiving breast milk at one month of age; iii) infants who were or were not still receiving breast milk at six months of age. Antibiotic exposure was categorised as follows: i) infants whose mother did or did not receive antibiotics during delivery; ii) infants who did or did not received systemic antibiotics before their first routine vaccinations scheduled at the age of six weeks (assessed individually). Statistical analysis In each group, the proportion of infants with an antibody concentration above the standard protective correlate value (seroprotection rate) was calculated for each vaccine.(6-8) The Clopper-Pearson method was used to estimate the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the seroprotection rates. The rates were compared between groups using Fisher's exact test and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for differences in proportions estimated. For FHA and PRN, no standard protective correlate value exists. In each group, the geometric mean concentration (GMC) for each vaccine antibody was calculated. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was obtained as the anti-logged coefficient from a linear regression with log-concentrations as outcome and early-life factors (biological sex, delivery mode, feeding choice and antibiotic exposure) as covariates (univariate regression). Effect modification was assessed using multiple linear regression with the following pre-spec ified factors: maternal age, maternal diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (dTpa, Boostrix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline)) and trivalent influenza vaccination in pregnancy, birth weight, gestational age, infant BCG and MMR vaccination status, age at first DTPa-HepB-IPV-Hib / PCV13 vaccination, age at sampling and time interval between 6-month or 12-month vaccination and blood sampling. The GMR for each vaccine antigen was adjusted for those factors that had an effect on vaccine antigen response. As the Hib-MenC vaccine includes a tetanus toxoid (as carrier protein) and a Hib component, infants who had received this vaccine before blood sampling at 13 months of age were excluded from the analysis of persistence of antibodies against these two vaccine antigens. A 5%-significance level was used. All statistical analyses were done using R version 3.4.3. Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedEthics Informed consent was obtained from participants' parents or guardians. The study was approved by the Royal Children's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC, authorisation, 38124A). Results Of the 471 participants, seven were excluded because they were a twin of another participant, five because extended parental consent to use the blood samples was not available, four because they were not vaccinated according to the routine schedule and one because vaccine records were not available (Figure 1). Of the remaining 454 participants, 365 had blood taken in the predefined time frame. At 7 months of age, 91 were included in the final analysis. At 13 months of age, 307 were included for measurement of persistence of antibodies against the primary course of vaccines ending at 6 months and 141 for antibody responses to the 12- month vaccines. The background characteristics of the 365 included participants are summarised in Table 1. The median gestational age was 39.3 weeks (interquartile range (IQR) 38.4-40.4) and the median birth weight 3.45 kg (IQR 3.13-3.76). Of the 365 infants, 179 (49%) were male, 137 (37%) were born by Caesarean section and 100 (28%) had received formula milk before discharge from their birth hospital. At 1 month of age, 302 (83%) infants were still receiving breast milk, at 6 months of age this number was 263 (72%). In total, 70 (19%) mothers received antibiotics during delivery: 36 (51%) because they were colonised with group B streptococcus, 27 (39%) because of prolonged rupture of membranes, 5 (7%) because of Caesarean section delivery and for 2 (3%) the reason was not specified. The administered Antibiotics were administered to 30 (8%) infants before their first routine vaccination schedule at six weeks of life. These infants received only one course of antibiotics each. The majority (n=22, 73%) received antibiotics within the first week cephalexin (n=1), and oral flucloxacillin (n=1)). The duration of administration varied between 2 and 7 days (mean 3, median 3). Of the remaining 8 infants, 4 were admitted to hospital for intravenous antibiotics (azithromycin (n=1) and antibiotics not documented (n=3)) between 2 and 5 weeks Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedof age (mean 3.5, median 3.5). The duration of administration was less than 5 days (n=2 infants) and between 5 and 10 days (n=2 infants). The infant who received intravenous azithromycin was continued on oral azithromycin for 3 days. Additionally, two infants were continued on oral antibiotics (not documented), one for 5 days and one for more than 10 days. There were 4 infants who received oral antibiotics after the first week of life (age range 2 to 4, mean 3.8, median 4 weeks) (amoxicillin (n=2), cephalexin (n=2)). The duration of administration was 5 to 10 days for all. Sex influences the magnitude of responses to certain vaccines At 7 months of age, females had a lower seroprotection rate against Hib compared with male infants (66% (95% CI 51.6-79.6%) vs 86% (95% CI 72.1-94.7%); p=0.05). However, overall there were no statistically significant differences between males and females i n seroprotection rates at 7 or 13 months of age (Table 2a and Figure 2). After adjustment for pre-specified factors, the female:male GMR was below one (indicating lower average antibody concentrations) in females for tetanus and FHA (Table 2b and Figure 2) at 7 months of age and for PRN at 13 months of age. These findings were statistically significant. At 13 months of age, adjusted average antibody concentrations were statistically significantly higher in females for polio type 3, pneumococcus serotype 6A and measles (Table 2b and Figure 2). No effect of delivery mode on vaccine responses At 7 months of age, seroprotection rates were lower in infants born vaginally than in those born by Caesarean section for the majority of vaccine antigens. However, none of these differences reached statistical significance. At 13 months of age, there were no differences in seroprotection rates between infants born vaginally or by Caesarean section (Supplementary Table S1a and Figure S1). At 13 months of age, infants born vaginally had a higher average antibody concentration against Hib (Supplementary Table S1b and Figure S1). No effect of feeding method on vaccine antibody responses At 7 and 13 months of age, there were no statistically significant differences in seroprotection rates or adjusted average antibody concentrations between infants who received or did not receive formula milk in first few days of life or between infants who were still receiving breast milk at 1 or 6 months of age and those who were not (Supplementary Tables S2a-4b Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedand Figures S2-4). The only exception was a statistically significant higher adjusted average antibody concentration (i.e. a GMR greater than one) against pneumococcus serotype 7F at 7 months of age in infants who did not receive formula milk during the first few days of life compared to those who did (Supplementary Table S2b and Figure S2), and higher antibody concentration for pneumococcus serotype 19F and MenC at 13 months of age in infants who were still receiving breast at 6 months of age (Supplementary Tables S4b and Figure S4). Minimal effect of intrapartum or infant antibiotic exposure on vaccine responses At 7 and 13 months of age, there were no differences in seroprotection rates between infants whose mothers did or did not receive antibiotics during delivery (Supplementary Table S5a and Figure S5). Infants whose mother received intrapartum antibiotics had a significantly higher adjusted average antibody concentration against PRN at 7 months and 13 months of age of age (Supplementary Tables S5b and Figure S5). Antibiotic exposure before their first routine vaccination scheduled at 6 weeks of age did not influence seroprotection rates or average antibody concentrations (Supplementary Table S6a-6b and Figure S6). Discussion This study is the first to investigate the effect of multiple different early-life factors on antibody responses to routine vaccinations in infancy. We found that infant biological sex had an impact on responses but delivery mode, feeding method, intrapartum antibiotics, and antibiotic exposure before the first routine immunisation did not. Our finding that females had lower antibody responses against tetanus, and higher responses against polio (type 3) is consistent with previous studies in adults (9-11). Previous studies have also reported female adults to have higher antibody responses to dengue, HepA, HepB, rabies, smallpox, and trivalent influenza vaccines, while male adults have been reported to have higher responses to diphtheria, and conjugated meningococcus A vaccines (2). The only studies which have previously been done in infants, reported higher antibody responses in females to HepB, Hib and PCV13 (2). Aside from a higher average antibody concentration in females against one pneumococcal serotype (6A), we did not find sex differences in the response to pneumococcal vaccination. This contrasts with studies in adults, in which males have generally been reported to have higher antibody responses to pneumococcal vaccines (2). Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedIn our study, we found that female infants had higher antibody levels against measles at 13 months of age than corresponding males. Previous studies investigating sex differences in responses to MMR vaccination report inconsistent findings. Some studies found higher antibody responses to measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination in females, whilst others found transiently lower GMCs to rubella and lower seroconversion rates to measles vaccination in females (2). Other studies did not find any sex differences in antibody responses to mumps and rubella, rubella vaccination. Notably, even though females are often reported to have higher antibody responses, faster waning of antibodies has been observed for antibodies against HepA and pneumococcus in females (2). One mechanisms through which sex can affect vaccine responses is through hormones: oestradiol, progesterone and testosterone all influence the function of immune cells (12). However, as sex differences in vaccine responses also occur before puberty and after menopause, other factors might also be involved. Many genes for proteins involved in the immune responses are encoded on the X chromosome, and mutations and polymorphisms of X-linked genes therefore have a greater impact in males (13). A further mechanism through which sex differences in vaccine responses might occur, is through epigenetic programming, which is also influenced by sex hormones (12). The microbiota, especially the intestinal microbiota, plays a crucial rule in the developme nt and regulation of the immune system, and its composition affects how individuals respond to vaccinations (14). Sex hormones play a key role in bacterial-host interactions (15) and sex differences in the microbiota might therefore influence immune responses (16, 17). As delivery mode and feeding method strongly affect the composition of the infant microbiota (18), these factors might be expected to influence vaccine responses. However, in our study, we did not observe any significant impact of delivery mode or feeding method on vaccines responses. Maternal antibodies may inhibit infant antibody responses to some vaccines (19) . Although the majority of maternal antibody transfer is through the placenta, breast milk also contains antibodies that might interfere with immune responses. Small studies have reported that after routine vaccination, breast-fed infants have higher serum IgG levels to diphtheria (20), Hib (21, 22) and oral polio virus (OPV) (20, 23) vaccination, and higher salivary IgA levels to Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedtetanus, diphtheria and OPV vaccination (20). For ORV vaccine, reduced seroconversion rates were observed in breast-fed infants compared with formula-fed infants (24, 25), however, this was not confirmed in subsequent studies (26). Infants with mixed feeding are sometimes classified as breast-fed and sometimes as non-breast-fed (26) and IgA levels, as well as the neutralising activity of IgA in breast-milk, may depend on geographic location (27). These factors could explain some of the inconsistency in results from different studies. The strengths of our study include the ability to adjust for a large number of possible confounding factors, the standardisation in the vaccines given and the wide range of measured antibody responses. The limitations of the study are the sample size and risk of type-2 error. Furthermore, we did not analyse antibody responses to the HepB vaccine, as this antigen was not included in our multiplex assay and we had insufficient sample volume for alternative assays. We also did not evaluate the effect of antibiotics that might have been transferred through breastmilk on infant vaccine responses. As most vaccines induce antibody concentrations above the protective threshold in the majority of infants, small differences in antibody concentrations between groups of individuals are unlikely to be clinically significant. However, differences in antibody concentrations might be relevant for the duration of protection. Nonetheless, when developing new vaccines and designing vaccine schedules, recognising factors which might influence vaccine antibody responses, offers ways to optimise vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy.
