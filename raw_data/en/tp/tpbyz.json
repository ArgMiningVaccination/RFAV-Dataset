With all of the toxins we encounter on a daily basis, it's important to cleanse your auric field with a loving, warm bath. I've been talking a lot about Earth ascending to a new vibration and here's the kick: we are too! We are not only taking our minds to a higher realm, but by the grace of God, our bodies are coming too. This is why I encourage cleansing rituals such as [burning sage](https://amzn.to/3KO2pM5), meditation, and detoxing, as ways to heal your temple from the inside out. Spiritual baths are a great way to welcome more balance and healing energy into your daily or weekly routine. [Tweet] Personally, I enjoy warm baths nightly- no forreal, I'm a Leo, I love pampering myself- soak with [bath salts](https://amzn.to/3mdCO5v), hibiscus, rose petals, [bubble bath](https://amzn.to/3UgRrl1), and whatever other ingredients that come to mind. Most of all, I make time for Me. You are worthy of this level of intent when it comes to cleansing yourself. Before 2020, we were all in such a rush to do everything that quick showers became the norm! No more. Your divine energy needs daily recharging, and a warm bath is always a good idea! Spiritual Bath A spiritual bath is a cleansing ritual that aims to purify your body, mind, and spirit. Here are steps for preparing a [spiritual bath](https://amzn.to/3zz4Co9) for yourself: - Prepare the bath: While in your [bath robe](https://amzn.to/3nMgUXr), fill your bathtub with warm water and add your preferred [cleansing ingredients](https://amzn.to/3UcI9qo). You can use Epsom salt, [sea salt](https://amzn.to/3mdCO5v), baking soda, herbs, essential oils, or flower petals. These ingredients have different cleansing properties and can be used for different intentions. You can also [burn incense](https://amzn.to/3KdRnOx), or play [soothing music](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C48X1E8/ref=sr_1_3?crid=D1EO23VBIKS0&keywords=chakra+healing+music&qid=1680808770&sprefix=chakra+healing+music%2Caps%2C97&sr=8-3)to create a peaceful atmosphere. I love using candles to set the mood and I chose [Bluecorn Beeswax Candles](https://capitaloneshopping.com/s/beeswaxcandles.com/coupon)because they have the most amazing beeswax candles! - Set your intention: Before entering the bath, set your intention for the spiritual bath. You can say a prayer, meditate, or visualize your intention. Your intention can be anything you want to release or attract in your life, such as negative emotions, stress, or negative energy. - Enter the bath: Once the bath is ready, enter the bathtub and soak your body for at least 20 minutes. While soaking, focus on your intention and allow yourself to relax and let go of any negative thoughts or emotions. - Cleanse your body: While soaking, you can use a washcloth or sponge to gently scrub your body. This helps to physically remove any negative energy or impurities from your body. - Release the water: Once you are finished with the bath, drain the water and visualize any negativity or impurities leaving your body and going down the drain. You can also say a prayer or affirmation to seal your intention. - Follow up with self-care: After the bath, take some time to relax and continue your self-care routine. You can rub [facial oil](https://amzn.to/3zAVm2y), start your [nightly skincare routine](https://amzn.to/3nWE6SM), use a [gua sha tool](https://amzn.to/3K8Ulne)on your face, lotion and massage your feet, or spray your perfume. Enjoy a cup of freshly [brewed tea](https://amzn.to/41pggOn), meditate, [journal,](https://amzn.to/3ZHyAAU)or do some gentle stretches to enhance the cleansing and relaxation effects of the bath. I love including candles, soothing sounds.. and the most important part: my intentions! I set my intentions, and wash any unwanted energy away, and also stay in the tub until the water drains out.
