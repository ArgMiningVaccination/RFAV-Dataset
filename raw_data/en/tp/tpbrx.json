Diseases and chronic health conditions leave many of us reeling today. Thus, we are looking for alternative ways to improve our total health and wellness. Enter Reiki. Reiki: A natural, more balanced approach to wellness? What is [Reiki](https://iarp.org/all-about-reiki/)? For many, it is a natural way to promote well being by helping to reduce stress and invite a state of calm, balanced relaxation. The practice first originated in Japan and then spreading west. The philosophy behind Reiki is to balance the body's energy field to activate the natural healing properties of the body. Reiki is the \"life force\" energy that flows through all things. Practitioners of this mode of healing understand that everyone can connect with their natural healing powers. They strive to strengthen the energy within themselves as a means of helping others to heal as well. Philosophers of this type of energy healing believe that the \"chi\" or life force energy within all of us should be balanced and free-flowing. When this universal energy becomes blocked or stagnant.

You'll feel relief from mental, emotional, and physical aspects. Sessions are pleasant, calming, and practitioners individualize sessions according to a person's unique needs and intentions. History of Reiki [Reiki](https://iarp.org/history-of-reiki/) comes to us from a master by the name of Mikao Usui. He first discovered the root system of energy and how it affects the body. His traditions and methods of practice passed down from generation to generation. Grandmasters underwent a rigorous process of initiation before he certified them to practice his teachings. Although other branches of this healing practice stem from this singular start, the Usui method of preparation is still the most widely used to promote the health and healing of all who come in contact with it. What does a typical healing session look like? A typical energy work session lasts anywhere from 60-90 minutes long. Initial consultations with practitioners include a conversation where both client and clinician have the opportunity to explain their intentions. Then they, ask and answer questions, set the treatment goals. A client will lie back on a massage table or other flat surface with their shoes removed. Work can begin via the hands-on approach, where a clinician applies light pressure to different areas of the body, or you may choose to opt for a hands-free approach, where a clinician will be working several inches from the body, and no touch is involved. The practitioner will then proceed to work with a client's energy field through a series of specific hand movements and postures designed to clear the energy field of the client. The session should leave both client and clinician balanced, relaxed, and feeling content. What does energy healing treat?

Improved detoxification and enhancement of the immune system In our current society, we spend so much of our time in fight/flight mode, reacting and adapting to stress, that our bodies take on a toxic overload of emotions and substances that clog up our energy system and, eventually, our physical bodies. Energy work allows for the clearing of these old stresses, which in turn helps to clean out and improve the efficient detoxification process of the physical body as well. The parasympathetic nervous system is allowed to perform some of the functions that have taken a back seat, and the body can breathe a sigh of relief and start the healing process once more. 5.

Most of us live life in a constant state of fight vs. flight, and this does significant damage to our mental, emotional, and physical health. 8.
