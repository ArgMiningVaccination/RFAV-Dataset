TUESDAY, JULY 18, 2000 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC. The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 1 p.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Dan Burton (chairman of the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Burton, Gilman, Morella, Ros-Lehtinen, Chenoweth-Hage, Waxman, Maloney, Norton, Also present: Mr. Weldon.Staff present: Kevin Binger, staff director; David A. Kass, deputy counsel and parliamentarian; S.

A quorum being present, the Committee on Govern- ment Reform will come to order. I ask unanimous consent that allMembers and witnesses ' written statements be included in the record. Without objection, so ordered. I ask unanimous consent thatall articles, exhibits and extraneous or tabular material referred tobe included in the record. Without objection, so ordered. For the last year, the Government Reform Committee has been looking at issues regarding vaccine safety, research and policy. Afew people have tried to portray this investigation as anti-vaccine.Nothing could be further from the truth. Safe, effective vaccinessave lives. On the other hand, vaccines that have not been thor-oughly tested and reviewed can be dangerous. The rotavirus vac-cine was a good example. The government and manufacturers ig-nored the warning signs. A lot of babies were injured and requiredsurgery. One baby died before the vaccine was pulled off the mar-ket. Is it irresponsible to ask questions about why that happened? Of course not. We have a lot of doctors who serve on Federal advisory commit- tees who have serious conflict of interest problems. They are al- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug on vaccines made by companies that they get money from. Is it irresponsible to ask questions about conflicts of interest? Of course not, especially where public health and safety are concerned. Today we are holding a hearing about why mercury is put into vaccines that are given to children. Is that irresponsible? Of coursenot. If someone holds hearings about mismanagement at the Depart- ment of Education, that does not mean they are anti-education.That means they want our educational system to be as well run aspossible. That is the way that I feel about our vaccine policies. Noarea is so sacrosanct that the world will come to an end if we asksome sensible questions and expect to get some sensible answers. I think this kind of oversight will make our vaccine program stronger not weaker. This spring we held a hearing about possible connections be- tween autism and the MMR vaccine. We heard lots of testimony onboth sides of the issue. After the hearing, I sent a letter to Sec-retary Shalala. So did Congressman Waxman. We both asked herto put together a panel of the best experts in the field to look atthis issue. That was May 16 \u20142 months ago. No response. That's intolerable. If your position is that we should base our policies on good science and good research, then fine. I agree withyou 100 percent. But if you are not willing to do the research, ifyou're not willing to ask the questions, then we have a real prob-lem on our hands. I believe that our primary focus on vaccine policy should always be what is best for the children. We need to insure that only vac-cines that are truly needed to protect the public health are addedto the childhood immunization schedule. At no time should the in-terests of vaccine developers be a higher priority than our chil-dren's health and well-being. Vaccines are the only drugs that Americans are required by a government agency to take. It is thus imperative that the FederalGovernment ensures the safety of these mandated vaccines. EachState sets a schedule for the vaccines a child must receive in orderto attend school or day care. The States rely on the Federal Gov-ernment for guidance on which vaccines should be mandated. TheFederal Government is also the largest purchaser of vaccines. That brings us to today 's hearing topic\u2014mercury in medicine. This should be a no-brainer. We all know that mercury is a toxicsubstance. Long-term exposure to low levels of mercury has beenlinked to mental retardation, cerebral palsy and central nervoussystem disorders. We assume that the FDA will protect our chil-dren from exposure to any level of mercury through drugs. But thathasn't been the case. Thimerosal was first marketed in 1930 and has become the most widely used preservative in vaccines. It ispresent in over 50 licensed vaccines. The FDA recently acknowledged that in the first 6 months of life children get more mercury than is considered safe by the EPA. Thetruth is that sometimes kids go to their doctor 's office and get four or five vaccines at the same time. My grandson received vaccinesfor nine different diseases in 1 day. He may have been exposed to62.5 micrograms of mercury in 1 day through his vaccines. Accord- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 his weight, the maximum safe level of mercury he should have been exposed to in 1 day is 1.5 micrograms, so that is 41times the amount at which harm can be caused. How much mercury are kids being exposed to at once? One would think that the FDA would have moved aggressively to remove vac-cines that contain mercury from the market immediately. They didnot. On July 9, 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics and theU.S. Public Health Service issued a joint statement recommendingthe removal of all thimerosal from vaccines. On May 31, 2000, theFood and Drug Administration notified vaccine manufacturers thatthe review of mercury compounds in drugs and foods concludedthat reducing or eliminated thimerosal from vaccines is merited.However, there has been no mandatory action. These vaccines arestill in use. The FDA continues to allow the mercury containing vaccines to remain on the market. Today, over 8,000 children in America maybe given a toxic dose of mercury in their vaccines. Many parents who have contacted the committee are concerned about other ingredients as well, including formaldehyde, MSG, andaluminum. We have also been contacted by many individuals whohave concerns about mercury in dental amalgams. While this is notthe focus of today 's hearing, it certainly warrants discussion as well. Congress directed the Environmental Protection Agency to con- tract with the National Research Council to prepare recommenda-tions on the appropriate dose for mercury exposure. That reportwas released on July 11. While the FDA relies on the Agency forToxic Substances and Disease Registry 's dosing level for mercury of 0.5 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day, this is sig-nificantly higher than the EPA 's dose of 0.1 microgram per kilo- gram of body weight. In that report it was confirmed that theEPA's reference dose is correct. We will hear from Dr. VaskenAposhian, University of Arizona at Tucson, one of the scientistswho worked on this report. Romana Trovato will testify on behalfof the Environmental Protection Agency. Section 413 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 required the FDA to compile a list of drugs and foodsthat contain internally introduced mercury compounds, and providea quantitative and qualitative analysis of the mercury compoundsin this list. The act also requires the agency to compile the list andprovide the analysis within 2 years after the date of its enactmenton November 21, 1997. Dr. William Egan will be testifying on be-half of the FDA today. While thimerosal has previously been ruled by the FDA to fit the ''generally recognized as safe '' standard, when the FDA conducted their over the counter drug review they changed their minds. TheFDA determined that mercury compounds used as active ingredi-ents in over the counter drug products were not found to be gen-erally recognized as safe. Additionally, the FDA has not approvedany mercury containing compounds as food additives and does notconsider any mercury containing compounds to be generally recog-nized as safe. On their own Website, the FDA states, ''lead, cad- mium, and mercury are examples of elements that are toxic whenpresent at relatively low levels. '' VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 it that mercury is not safe for food additives and over the counter drug products but it is safe in our vaccines and dental amalgams? Dr. Roger H. Bernier, Associate Director for Science at the Na- tional Immunization Program, Centers for Disease Control andPrevention, will testify regarding the recent discussion of the Advi-sory Committee on Immunization Practices regarding thimerosal. Autism is a syndrome characterized by impairments in social re- latedness and communication, repetitive behaviors, abnormalmovements, and sensory dysfunction. Autism may now affect 1 in150 U.S. children. We will hear from Dr. Marie Bristol-Power ofthe National Institutes of Health regarding the existing research inautism. The characteristics of autism and of mercury poisoning arestrikingly similar. Dr. Stephanie Cave, a physician from Baton Rogue, LA will be testifying about the mercury toxicity she is seeing in the 200 autis-tic children she has as patients. Autism strikes families from a diverse background. We will hear from five parents today. Elizabeth Birt of Chicago, an attorney andmother of an autistic child, will be testifying about the need to re-move mercury from all vaccines and a citizens petition that is beingpresented to the FDA making this request. Several parents with scientific and medical backgrounds have written a report entitled ''Autism: A Unique Type of Mercury Poi- soning.'' Three of these parents will be testifying today. The leadauthor of the report is Sallie Bernard of Cranford, NJ. Lyn Red-wood of Tyrone, GA is a nurse practitioner, and Albert Enayati ofParamus, NJ is a chemist. Dr. Sharon Humiston, a doctor with anautistic child, will also be testifying. Our children are the future of this country. As a government, we have a responsibility to do everything within our power to protectthem from harm, including insuring that vaccines are safe and ef-fective. Every day that these mercury containing vaccines remainon the market is another day we are putting 8,000 children thatday at risk. The record will remain open until August 1, 2000.Now I will recognize my colleague, Mr. Waxman, for his opening statement. Mr. W AXMAN . Today we are having another hearing to highlight allegations of the safety of vaccines. In April this committee held a hearing to publicize the chair- man's theory that certain vaccines, particularly the MMR vaccine,cause autism. This theory is based mainly on speculation. As theAmerican Medical Association concluded recently, ''Scientific data does not support a causal association between vaccination and au-tism.'' Today we are going to hear testimony about a new theory, that there is a link between autism and the mercury-based vaccine pre-servative called thimerosal. It should be noted that the MMR vac-cine does not contain thimerosal. So this new theory is directed atchildhood vaccines other than the measles, mumps and the rubellavaccine. As I said in April, we must not get ahead of the science or raise false alarms. The best answers come from research that can with- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 rigors of the scientific method. These standards have been developed in order to find the truth. But if allegations areraised without scientific evidence, we risk scaring parents into fore-going potentially life saving childhood immunizations. Regrettably I fear that once again we are proceeding without a sound scientific basis. This hearing today combines two issues that I have worked on for years, autism and mercury. I have been a strong supporter ofresearch and treatment for autism. I am a current sponsor of au-tism research and surveillance legislation, H.R. 997 and H.R. 274.I was also a leading supporter and sponsor of the Work IncentivesProgram Act of 1999, the American Disabilities Act of 1990 and theDevelopmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of1990, which are all laws of tremendous importance to persons withautism. And in 1993, when I was chairman of the House Commerce Sub- committee on Health and the Environment, I was the lead sponsorof the NIH Revitalization Act, which reauthorized expanded fund-ing for and strengthened NIH research into autism and childhoodhealth. I have also been very concerned about public exposure to mer- cury. For example, last year I introduced the Clean SmokestacksAct, H.R. 2900, to reduce methyl mercury emissions from powerplants by 90 percent. As a National Academy of Sciences reportconfirmed only last week, these emissions pose a significant healththreat and must be reduced. Methyl mercury contamination hascaused 40 States to issue warnings about fish consumption. Humanexposure to eating contaminated fish can cause numerous adversehealth affects such as losses of sensory or cognitive ability, delaysin developmental milestones, birth defects, tremors, convulsionsand even death. Currently, my legislation to reduce mercury emissions has over 100 bipartisan cosponsors, but it hasn 't even been called up for a hearing, let alone movement by the leadership of the committeethat has jurisdiction. For the last two Congresses, I have also intro-duced bipartisan legislation to require better public disclosure ofmercury pollution. This legislation has over 100 bipartisan cospon-sors, and I point this out to illustrate that I take the issue of mer-cury very seriously. Where we have a reasonable basis for takingaction I believe that the Congress and agencies should expedi-tiously work to protect the public health from mercury exposure. For this reason I strongly support the efforts by FDA to elimi- nate the use of thimerosal in vaccines. Thimerosal is a preservativethat contains ethyl mercury. Although less is known about the ef-fects of ethyl mercury in thimerosal than about the effect of ethylmercury from power plant emissions, ethyl mercury may pose simi-lar health risks. It is appropriate, therefore, that thimerosal bephased out of vaccines. This process is well underway. The maximum exposure to mer- cury through vaccines today is 60 percent of what it was a year ago. The entire childhood immunization schedule is currently avail-able without thimerosal and FDA expects all vaccines to be thimer-osal free by the first quarter of next year. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug however, is not whether mer- cury-containing thimerosal should be in vaccines in the United States. FDA decided a year ago that it should not. Rather, the pur-pose of this hearing appears to be to publicize the theory that thi-merosal is causing autism. The evidence to support this theory is virtually nonexistent. I fear that once again we are pursuing an anti-vaccine agenda in dis-regard for the scientific and medical consensus on the safety of vac-cines. The chairman has held a series of hearings on questioning vac- cine safety, the public health benefits of childhood immunizationsand the integrity of the scientists, health professionals and publicservants working to immunize our children. The chairman has pro-moted allegations that MMR vaccines causes autism. He has pro-vided a forum for allegations that vaccines can cause diabetes, andhe has alleged that parents should be skeptical about vaccines be-cause our government is beholden to the drug industry. Well, this is a backward attitude to take at a time when vaccines promise more than ever to improve human health. I will read and listen to the testimony of the witnesses today very attentively. I want to thank the parents who are coming hereand testifying. It takes a lot of courage to share your personal ex-periences with Congress. We have other things going on at the same time as this hearing, which keeps us from being able to attend the hearing in full, andI will be in and out and I want to apologize to those witnesses. Thewritten testimony will be part of the record. I will have a chanceto review it. My staff will be here and will have an opportunity toreport to me on all of the testimony that is given orally that maysupplement the written record as well. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this chance to give an opening statement. Mr. B URTON . Before we ask any other Members if they would like to make an opening statement, we have Dr. Weldon, Congress-man Weldon, who is very interested in this subject, and I wouldlike to ask unanimous consent that he be able to participate in thehearing. Mr. W AXMAN . Reserving the right to object, I am not going to ob- ject to him sitting in and being able to hear the testimony and pur-sue questions, but that is unusual because usually you have onlymembers of the committee participate and if we allowed all Mem-bers to come in, it could delay many hearings to a great extent. Butwe want to accommodate this request and I certainly want to ac-commodate Dr. Weldon, for whom I have a great deal of respect. We have 11 witnesses testifying today, and we on the minority asked for four witnesses and we were only accommodated by get-ting three. Now, when I say we were accommodated, we asked thatthe Centers for Disease Control be allowed to testify. We asked fora witness from NIH to testify. It shouldn 't be a request of ours, it is no favor to us to have them testify. In any balanced hearing wecertainly ought to have these people in to testify as well as thosewho are going to come in and express a particular point of view.We requested four witnesses and we got three. One more witnesswould have taken 5 minutes of testimony because that is what we VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug to take in giving oral testimony. Mr. Weldon will have an opportunity to ask questions at least 5 minutes oneround\u2014\u2014 Mr. W ELDON . Would the gentleman yield. Mr. W AXMAN . In a minute. I welcome that because I think he will bring out information, but it just troubles me that while we tryto be accommodating, I find it incomprehensible why the majorityof the committee and the chairman of this committee is not accom-modating our requests. And I yield to the gentleman, and I do not object and I welcome you because you have a special interest and expertise. Mr. W ELDON . I thank the gentleman 's kindness and I just want to point out that I have another hearing to go to in 30 minutes,so I doubt that I will be able to get in any oral questions. Mr. W AXMAN . I don't object to you participating and asking ques- tions. I point out the reluctance of the majority to have a fair andfull and open hearing and accommodate all of the witnesses whohave something to add, even if they may have something to add ona point that the chairman may disagree with. I withdraw my res-ervation. Mr. B URTON . Without objection, so ordered. Do any other mem- bers have opening statements? Representative Morella.Mrs. M ORELLA . Mr. Chairman, I just ask the fact that my writ- ten statement be included in the record and I just want to com-ment on the fact that I appreciate your efforts to hold this hearingon mercury and medicine, and I look forward to hearing the testi-mony of the witnesses. I really want to learn more about mercuryand medicine and vaccines specifically. In Montgomery County, the incidence of autism in our children is alarming, and some do feel that autism may be related to vac-cines, but I am concerned about the lack of information and misin-formation surrounding the issue of vaccines and its possible rela-tionship to autism, so that I hope that today we can come to a con-clusion on what the appropriate steps are for this committee andthe government to take. So with your approval, the rest of my opening statement I would like to have in the record. Mr. B URTON . Without objection, so ordered. [The prepared statement of Hon. Constance A. Morella follows:] VerDate S CHAKOWSKY . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will not be able to stay for all of today 's hearing. I would like unanimous consent to submit some questions for the EPA and to the FDA for the record. Mr. B URTON . Without objection, so ordered. [The prepared statement of follows:] VerDate I also want to take a moment to welcome all of the witnesses, but particularly Ms. Birt. While not a constituent of mine, we live in neighboring towns and the two of us have ex-changed letters in the past.

I would like to put my opening statement in the record so we can hear from the witnesses. Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Without objection, so ordered. We will now welcome our first panel to the witness table, Ms. Redwood, Ms. Bernard, Mr.Enayati, Ms. Birt, Dr. Cave, URTON . Ms. Redwood, if you can confine your remarks to 5 minutes. Ms. Redwood.

Chairman Burton, Congressman Waxman and committee members, I want to thank you for holding this hearing today and inviting me to testify on this important issue. My nameLyn Redwood. I reside in Atlanta, GA with my husband Tommyand three children, Hanna, Drew and Will. My husband and I areboth health care professionals. My husband is a physician, and Iam nurse practitioner. I also hold a master 's degree in community health nursing and I am a member of our county 's Board of Health and Local Planning Commission. My son Will weighed in at close to 9 pounds at birth. He was a happy baby who ate and slept well, smiled, cooed, walked andtalked all by 1 year of age. Shortly after his first birthday, he expe-rienced multiple infections, lost speech, eye contact and developeda very limited diet and suffered intermittent bouts of diarrhea. Heunderwent multiple evaluations and was initially diagnosed with aglobal receptive and expressive speech delay and later with perva-sive developmental disorder, a form of autism. I would never have made a correlation between my son 's disabil- ity and vaccines until July 1999, when I read that a preservative,thimerosal, utilized in some infant vaccines actually contained 49.6percent mercury. The report said that the FDA had determinedthat ''infants who received thimerosal-containing vaccines at sev- eral visits may be exposed to more mercury than recommended byFederal guidelines for total mercury exposure. '' As health care pro- viders, my husband and I constantly receive notices that adverseevents have been reported with a drug or product safety sheetshave been revised, and I was wondering why no such notices weresent out notifying us that thimerosal preservative vaccines were ex-ceeding Federal guidelines for mercury exposure in infants. It was in light of this information that I reviewed my son 's vac- cine record and my worse fears were confirmed. All of his early vac-cines that could have possibly contained thimerosal, had. From my VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 mercury, I have found it to be a potent human toxin, which is especially damaging to the rapidly developing fetal and in-fant brain. While acceptable levels for exposure are published byFederal agencies, mercury is a poison at any level. The dose thought to be safely allowed on a daily basis by EPA is 0.1 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. At 2 months of agemy son had received 62.5 micrograms of mercury from three infantvaccines. According to this EPA criteria, his allowable dose wasonly 0.5 micrograms based upon his weight. He had received 125times his allowable exposure on that day. These large injectedbolus exposures continued at 2 months, 4 months, 12 months and18 months to a total mercury exposure of 237.5 micrograms. I alsodiscovered that the injections that I received during my pregnancy,the first and third trimesters, and hours after the delivery of myson to prevent RH blood incompatibility disease also containedmercury. Knowing that the major effect of mercury compounds is neurotoxicity, I questioned if these exposures could account for myson's regression and disability. Since he was now 5 12years old, it would be difficult for me to know what his mercury levels had beenat that time. It was then that I remembered having kept a lock ofhair from his first haircut at 20 months of age. Heavy metal analy-sis detected 4.8 parts per million mercury in his hair, the allowablelevels being less than 1 part per million. The EPA action level inhair is 1 part per million as well, and 5 parts per million is consid-ered diagnostic for mercury toxicity. Since my son has never eaten fish nor seafood nor had dental amalgams, I had no other identifiable source for his mercury levelsoutside of the thimerosal exposure from his vaccines and myRhoGAM injections. Since last fall I have spent every free moment researching this issue. As a nurse and a member of the Board of Health for ourcounty, I felt an urgency to share my findings and concerns aboutthimerosal with other professionals. I did research and made phonecalls, and I wrote letters and I actually went in person to Washing-ton to meet with FDA and CDC officials to voice my concerns andpresent data on documented levels of mercury in many other chil-dren with developmental delays who were also exposed to thimero-sal in their vaccines. All of my efforts seemed to fall on deaf ears. On June 21, 2000 I attended the Advisory Committee for Immu- nization Practices meeting held in Atlanta. At that meeting a studywas presented that looked at Vaccine Safety Datalink informationand thimerosal exposure in over 120,000 children. The key findingsof the study were significant associations between thimerosal expo-sure and ADD, tics, speech and language delay andneurodevelopmental delays in general. A panel of experts who wereconvened to review the data who concluded, ''The findings supporta statistically significant, albeit weak association, but that the im-plications are profound.'' Unfortunately, ACIP chose not to give preference to thimerosal free vaccines, even though the vaccine manufacturers present atthis meeting assured there was enough supply available to meetvaccine needs the first 6 months of life. From the comments madeby ACIP committee members it was apparent that political and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug for the vaccine program had taken precedence over the health, safety and welfare of the children it is charged toprotect. One committee member even remarked that giving pref-erence for thimerosal free vaccines may result in reduced publicconfidence in vaccine programs. From my own personal perspective,just the opposite has occurred. You may hear today from some officials that the mercury expo- sure from medicinal sources is insignificant. The fact is that neuro-logical damage is documented to occur in infants at these levels ofexposure. You may also hear that these levels of exposure only ex-ceed EPA guidelines the first 6 months of life. That is because thedata was inaccurately averaged over a 6-month period of time. Asany independent toxicologist will tell you, mercury has a long half-life and its inherent pharmacokinetics you cannot legitimately cal-culate the effect of a bolus dose as though it were ingested in smallamounts over a long period of time. To make a simple analogy,what FDA is trying to assert is that giving someone two Tylenola day for 30 days has the same effect of giving them 60 Tylenolall at once in 1 day. This defies common sense, much less soundmedical practice. The truth is vaccines are the single largest source of mercury ex- posure postnatally in infants, but nowhere in the mercury lit-erature of EPA, FDA, ATSDR are these products even identified asbeing a source of exposure. When I spoke with one official fromEPA, he commented that my son 's exposure was very high and was rather sympathetic, but since it was not an environmental expo-sure, his agency could not get involved. So whom do I turn to forhelp? Over 1 year ago the FDA, AAP and the Public Health Service called for the immediate elimination of reduction of thimerosalfrom vaccines, but the sad truth is that while some progress hasbeen made, infants continue to be injected with one of the mostneurotoxic metals on Earth in excess of Federal safety guidelinesas I speak here today, and the responsible agencies are unwillingto address this issue. We are in the midst of an autism epidemic and children diag- nosed with learning disabilities continue to increase daily. Thestatement that there is no evidence of harm does not equate withno harm not having occurred. The truth is that we have not ade-quately looked or we just refuse to see. A recent national news article which addressed these concerns reported that some may say we don 't have a smoking gun but the truth is the bullets are all over the floor. Millions of children havebeen needlessly exposed to toxic acts from federally sponsored vac-cine programs and have suffered neurological damage. This prob-lem has become so pervasive in our society that few are left un-touched, as Chairman Burton well knows. It is time for someoneto step forward and acknowledge these facts and provide the science to fully investigate what has happened to our children andwhat can be done to help them. Thank you.[The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Ms. B ERNARD . I have some slides. Mr. B URTON . We will put those up on the screen as you speak. Ms. B ERNARD . Chairman Burton, Congressman Waxman and other distinguished members of this committee, thank you for hold- ing this hearing to examine the possible role of mercury and thi-merosal in causing neurodevelopmental disorders. My name is Sallie Bernard. I live in New Jersey. I am the moth- er of triplets, age 12, Fred, Jimmy and Billy. After meeting all ofhis developmental milestones on schedule and receivingunremarkable pediatric reports up to age 2 12, Billy began to ex- hibit slower word acquisition than his brothers, articulation dif-ficulties and attentional problems. At 3 12he was diagnosed with language dysphasia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Atage 4 12he was diagnosed with autism. Anyone familiar with the signs of mercury toxicity in children will recognize language difficulties and ADHD traits as commonfeatures. But in fact, research conducted by me and others hasshown that the characteristics of autism itself are identical to thosearising from mercury exposure. This chart that I have up here shows only some of the similar- ities between autism and mercury poisoning. This shows some ofthe behavioral characteristics of autism and mercury poisoning.They include social withdrawal, repetitive and compulsive behav-iors, language difficulties, sensory disturbance, movement dis-orders, cognitive deficits and unusual behaviors like head banging. Next slide. This slide shows physiological aspects of mercury poi- soning and autism. We see the same similarities, damage to thesame brain areas, EEG patterns, and so forth. The next slide. On the population characteristics, males more af- fected than females for both disorders and the presence of a stronggenetic component. We feel that these similarities are too close tohave occurred by chance. We are not alone in our thinking. Thejust released congressionally mandated mercury report by the Na-tional Academy of Sciences links methyl mercury and the environ-ment to neurological deficits in children, and we know from re-searchers such as Suzuki and Magos that the ethyl mercury foundin thimerosal is as toxic as methyl mercury. The latest issue of En-vironmental Health Perspectives also notes that an association hasbeen found between exposure to toxic chemicals and variousneurodevelopmental disorders such as learning disabilities, intellec-tual retardation, attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder, autismand propensity to violence. It is well-recognized by autism researchers, as reviewed by Dr. Bristol-Power and others, that autism is caused by an interactionof environmental and genetics factors. Based on epidemiologicaland other data we have proposed that this environmental factor isthimerosal from vaccinations acting alone or synergistically withother toxins. This is why we believe this to be true. Next slide. This chart shows the prevalence of autism and vac- cine history. Thimerosal was first introduced into vaccines in the1930's and autism was first discovered by Leo Kanner in the early 1940's among children born in the 1930 's. Studies prior to 1970 es- timated autism to occur in 1 in 2,000 children while studies after VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug the prevalence at about 1 in 1,000. This was also a period of increased immunization of American children. In 1996 theNIH has estimated the rate of autism to be higher at 1 in 500, andjust this year the CDC has found 1 in 250 children affected withclassic autism. This dramatic increase in the past decade coincideswith the introduction and spread of two new thimerosal containingvaccines, the HIB and the hepatitis B. Another observation is that autistic symptoms emerge within a short time after vaccination, generally following a period of normaldevelopment. Importantly, the amount of mercury injected witheach vaccine given as a bolus or spike does greatly exceeds EPAand safety guidelines and thus is highly likely to be neurotoxic andinjurious. Last, as Lyn noted, a recent CDC study has found a statistically significant association between thimerosal and vaccines specifically,and attention deficit disorders, speech delay, motor tics andneurodevelopmental disorders in general. Thus, we see the symptoms of autism and mercury poisoning are the same and the epidemiological and exposure data are highlysupportive of a thimerosal etiology. Since thimerosal is not a nec-essary component of vaccines and every child can be fully immu-nized today with a non-thimerosal alternative, thimerosal shouldno longer be allowed in vaccines. Congress, again listening to the needs of citizens, passed legisla- tion in 1997 requiring government agencies to review thimerosalcontent in products. In response, the FDA investigated thimerosalin vaccines and found that no safety studies had ever been con-ducted on this substance. As a parent, this is very disconcerting indeed. Vaccines are recog- nized as the crown jewels of the U.S. Public Health Service andtheir effectiveness relies on the willingness of parents to bring theirchildren in to be immunized. By not conducting safety studies andthen not taking immediate steps to ban thimerosal once its poten-tial for harm was publicly recognized, this program has been putat great risk. What parent will want their baby injected repeatedlywith a known neurotoxin? How much confidence will parents havethat our national vaccine program really cares about safety? Par-ents like me already have their doubts that it does. I hope that Congress will respond once again with effective ac- tion to ensure the safety and well-being of all our children in lightof the information now presented. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Bernard follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Enayati. Mr. E NAYATI . Good afternoon. My name is Albert Enayati. I am president of the Cure Autism Now! Foundation, New Jersey chap-ter. Our foundation headquarters are located in Congressman Wax-man's district. My wife Sima and I are scientists who have workedfor pharmaceutical companies. We have a child with autism. Mr. Chairman, in 1971, when my wife and I were growing up in Iran, a tragic event was taking place in our neighboring countryIraq. In October of that year, Iraq imported more than 90,000 tonsof grain treated with methyl mercury. Much of the grain was usedas daily baked bread. The reports from Iraq were shocking. The ex-tensive mercury poisoning caused thousands of Iraq farmers andtheir families to become neurologically damaged. Hundreds died.The Iraqi episode is not unique. Similar misfortunes include mer-cury epidemics in Minamata, Japan, Guatemala and Russia. In thefirst half of the century, poisoning of infants and toddlers by mer-cury in teething powders led to acrodynia, or Pink Disease. Today, another mercury tragedy is unfolding, this time among our children. As a scientist and a parent, I sadly declare that ethylmercury in vaccines has been causing autism, attention deficit dis-order and other neurodevelopmental diseases in children who, assusceptible infants and toddlers, were injected with thimerosal, avaccine preservative which is 49.6 percent ethyl mercury by weight. In 1982, 18 years ago, an FDA panel concluded that thimerosal is toxic, causes cell damage, can cause allergic reactions, and is noteffective in killing bacteria or halting their replication. A recenthepatitis control report details how FDA, via its own Committee onBiologics, had failed, for 17 years, since the 1982 report, to followtheir own organizational directives which specify ensuring productsafety. Fortunately, because of the FDA Modernization Act of 1997,the CBER was forced to evaluate thimerosal in vaccines. By 1998, the CBER 's thimerosal study had run into difficulty. It is against Federal statutes to add toxic material to childhood vac-cines, and thimerosal appeared to be contrary to this importantlaw. CBER staff then searched for safety data and guidelines butfound none. In fact, the CBER learned that there is very limitedliterature available on ethyl mercury. The CBER team then compared ethyl mercury intake with Fed- eral guidelines for safe mercury intake, but again the CBER raninto difficulty. Thimerosal is injected in bolus doses and metabo-lized in humans to ethyl mercury but all theoretical guidelines forsafe mercury intake were based upon ingested methyl mercury.Left with no choice, the CBER team assumed that the toxicity ofthimerosal injected in bolus doses was equivalent to that of methylmercury ingested gradually. Armed with this assumption, they compared the vaccinal ethyl mercury intake in children 6 months old to the suggested safe lim-its by EPA. It was then that they made a remarkable discovery:Even without considering infants and toddlers ' susceptibility to neurotoxic effects, the mercury intake from vaccinations in the first6 months of life far exceeded the limit set by EPA. I believe that the FDA record justifies concluding that the U.S. immunization program has been in violation of Federal statutes. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug have superseded safety guidelines and appropriate testing. Dangerous substances in vaccines remain un-tested. This negligence is inexcusable. Thousands of children andtheir families have been neurologically impaired by physician-in-jected ethyl mercury and while this has happened, the responsiblesupervisory agency, the FDA, was asleep at the wheel. Mr. Chairman, despite the FDA warning in 1982 and the known toxicity of thimerosal, the FDA allowed the continued injection ofcell damaging neurotoxic product into our children. Furthermore,since 1990, the FDA and CDC increased the likelihood of neuro-logical damage by allowing thimerosal to be injected into day-oldand 2-month-old infants. I am here because of my son Payam. Formore than a year, he passed his developmental milestones, butafter his DPT and MMR shots, Payam began not responding to hisname, no longer ran to greet me when I returned from work. Hisspoken language disappeared and he no longer responded to hisparent's words. Within a few months he had begun biting himself,hitting his head against the wall, flapping hands, toe walking andrunning aimlessly around the house. Even sleep patterns had dete-riorated. All these traits appear in medical literature about mer-cury poisoning. Mr. Chairman, every symptom of my son 's autism parallels traits known in mercury poisoning. Many experts would have us believe that my son 's regression was coincident with his vaccination. However, as a trained sci-entist, my reading of mercury literature indicates that every traitthat defines autism can be induced by organic mercury. Not sur-prisingly, the FDA and CDC have asked vaccine producers to initi-ate a gradual discontinuance of using vaccines containing thimero-sal. However, no family needs a neurologically impaired child. In-jecting ethyl mercury in infants and toddlers ought to be discon-tinued immediately and clinical research to be initiated regardingmechanisms of treatment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Ms. Birt. Ms. B IRT. Thank you. My name is Liz Birt. I live in Wilmette, IL with my husband and children, Sarah age 8, Matthew age 6 andAndrew age 4. I would like to thank you for holding this hearingtoday and allowing me to testify. I have sat in this room before as a member of the audience. On April 6 of this year I listened as the chairman 's opening statement detailed in part the story of my son Matthew. Matthew is classifiedas autistic, a diagnosis made entirely on behavioral observations.However, he has physical problems, including antibodies to myelinbasic protein, abnormal EEG, inflammatory bowel disease and livemeasles virus in his terminal ileum. Matthew 's immunologist at a teaching hospital believes that the thimerosal contained in the vac-cines contributed to the development of these medical conditionsand they have led to his contraction of the live measles virus bypriming this immune symptom for an adverse reaction. I am also here testifying as an advocate for not only the imme- diate recall of thimerosal containing vaccines but for fundamentalchange. This is unfortunately a failure to assign responsibility forvaccines which are mandatory for all children. The manufacturers,the FDA and the CDC, NIH and the AAP all share responsibility VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug to remain in vaccines. This is the man- date of the FDA. The American public relies on this agency withits scientific experts to protect us. Yet for some unknown reasonthis issue was ignored. Why are American children today being ex-posed to vaccines which on a conservative basis subject them to 30times the allowable amount of mercury for an adult? Why weren 't the most basic calculations done to ensure that these products aresafe? It is the children like my son who were injured in the nameof the greater good who, just like the soldiers returning from theVietnam War, are now being ignored. I am here today to let the members of the committee know that these children have voices, and the voices of their parents and thegrandparents, some of which are in this room today, will be heardhowever unpleasant the message. We want these products off themarket immediately. Not one more child should be vaccinated withthese vaccines. Members of the committee may ask how does a member of the public speak with such conviction. Everything that is an officialgovernmental publication paints a picture of complete safety. How-ever, it does not take a genius to be able to discern the truth fromthe spin, deliberate material misrepresentations and even fraudcontained in some of these publications. The CDC's fact sheet on thimerosal states ''thimerosal is a mer- cury containing preservative that has been used since the 1930 's. It is used to ensure the medical products stay potent and sterile.It has been used in medicines as well as medical products such asthroat sprays and contact lens solutions. '' This I submit would leave the average American parent to conclude that thimerosal isnot a toxic substance. What is missing is since 1977 clinicians have recognized thimero- sal as being potentially dangerous. For nearly 20 years the U.S.Government has singled out thimerosal as a potential toxin. Myquestion to the committee members and to the FDA is: Why is thi-merosal even in these vaccines if it was determined in 1982 by theFDA that it was not even safe or effective as a bacteriostatic agent:Why has this product not been recalled? This fact sheet states mercury exposures from vaccines contain- ing thimerosal are within the safety margins included in exposureguidelines established by Federal agencies. The reality is there areno established safety margins published by any Federal agency forthimerosal exposure in infants and toddlers, and American childrentoday are receiving many multiples of the EPA daily exposureguidelines for mercury for adults. Why aren't the parents being told the truth by the CDC? If these statements were held to the same standards that we have for SECrules, all of these people would be subject to prosecution. TheCDC's own Vaccine Safety and Development Officer is on record asstating that Part of our problem is, unlike efficacy doses where there was a real effort on the part of the World Health Organization case definition ahead of time, similar effortswere not done for safety. The CDC is currently working with several large HMOs and a large link data base to study adverse events. The data base will study single validation, new vac-cines and new schedules. Future topics could include examining communication ofvaccine risk and defining the biological basis of groups at risk for adverse events. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug all of the positive things that were done by the Vaccine Compensation Act of 1986, one thing that they more or less neglected was research. They found a mechanism to fund an injury compensation program after the injury has alreadyhappened, but there is no way at this point to fund the research to try to preventsuch injuries. Why wasn't a safety definition developed? Why isn 't it important to identify those at risk for adverse vaccine events? Why isn 't re- search funded? We must have accountability today. Conflicts of interest on vac- cine committees at the FDA and CDC must be eliminated. Thestakes are too high. We as parents need information on which tobase informed consent. When my son was vaccinated at 2 days oflife, I was only told after the vaccine was given. How can this typeof process allow parents to receive the type of information that theyneed to make their decisions regarding the care of their children?We are the caregivers of our children, not these agencies. Members of the committee, I urge you to support a petition to be filed this week by the Coalition for Safe Minds. This petition callsfor the immediate recall of all vaccines containing thimerosal.These vaccines should never be used. Our country is experiencingan epidemic of neurodevelopmental disorders. These conditionscause not only heartbreak to the affected families, but the financialramifications are immense to our entire country. Thank you.[The prepared statement of Ms. Birt follows:] VerDate Thank you. Dr. Cave. Dr. C AVE. My name is Stephanie Cave. I am in family practice in Baton Rouge, LA. I want to express my deep appreciation to youand to the members of the committee for allowing me to testify. Iam presently treating over 300 autistic children, with an additional150 waiting to get in. Dr. Amy Holmes, the physician-parent of anautistic child, joined in February to help with the overwhelmingnumbers of children with this problem. We are treating childrenfrom all over the United States and getting calls from many placesaround the globe. This is truly an epidemic. If you have any ideathat it is not, I invite you to sit in my office for 2 hours. Mercury can exist as a pure element or in various forms of or- ganic and inorganic mercury and it affects the immune system andneurological systems at a very basic level. The timing of infant vac-cines with mercury corresponds to critical periods of neuronal de-velopment. The blood brain barrier is not fully developed in the in-fant or toddler. The fetus is at risk of exposure to toxins duringgestation, including methyl mercury from seafood eaten by themother or other sources, Rhogam, which we have already men-tioned, given at 28 weeks gestation, and the influenza vaccinegiven during pregnancy. These metals can be passed not onlytransplacentally, but also through breast milk to the infant at atime when the liver detoxification process is not perfected to thepoint of removing the metals. We have measured this detoxification process, and we have found it to be woefully inadequate in the developmentally delayed chil-dren. The organic ethylmercury injected in bolus through vaccinesenters the brain and converts to inorganic mercury, which cannotcross back over the blood brain barrier. This form is more likely tocause autoimmune antibodies to brain tissue, and this is what weare seeing in these children. I believe that the introduction of the hepatitis B vaccine in 1991 has sparked this recent epidemic because of thimerosal. Whenadded to the mercury imparted through the DPT and HIB, the ex-posure to mercury exceeds EPA safe limits for the metal if you con-sider a bolus dose on a single day. The EPA limits are usually re-lated to ingested mercury, which is partially cleared by the liver.Injecting boluses of ethyl mercury presents an entirely different,another scenario. The 2-month dose of mercury is at least 30 timeshigher than the recommended daily maximum exposure set by theEPA. During the 1990 's, infants received 12.5 micrograms of mercury at birth, followed by 12.5 micrograms at 1 month, 62.5 microgramsat 2 months, 50 micrograms at 4 months, 50 micrograms at 6months, 50 micrograms at 15 to 18 months; a total of 237.5micrograms for a child who at best weighs 10 kilograms. This farexceeds the safety limits if you consider bolus dosing. Safety limitswould be more like 1 to 1.5 micrograms. In establishing normal safety limits, if there is such a thing for a metal as toxic as mercury, bolus injections were not considered. Consider a nurse giving an injection who is not shaking the vialaccording to directions before drawing out the vaccine dose. This VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug a chance that child receiving the last dose could get as much as 10 times the usual amount in one dose. There was an article in the Journal of Pediatrics in May 2000 that showed mercury in the blood of infants at birth prior to thehepatitis B injection. After the vaccine, the levels rose in the bloodof the infants tested. In some preterm infants, there were levelsthat measured 10 times that seen in term infants. The bile produc-tion is minimal in infancy, making it more difficult for metals tobe cleared from the body. When added to a vaccine, the metals areeven more dangerous because the vaccines trigger immune reac-tions that increase the permeability of the GI tract and the blood/brain barrier. The injection of mercury appears to affect only certain children but I fear that we 've underestimated the devastation by concentrat- ing only on the autistic children. We 're measuring elevated levels of mercury in other children with milder difficulties like learningdisabilities, ADHD, Asperger 's Syndrome and many others. We do not have any idea what the scope of this problem is at this point.And there are no safety standards for infants getting bolus dosesof ethylmercury. We cannot compare the effects of a bolus dose inan infant to a daily dose in an adult. There are no parameters forcomparison. We have simplified the problem in our practice. We test all devel- opmentally delayed children for the presence of heavy metals. Hairis screened, followed by a determination in urine after a challengeof an oral chelator, DMSA, and it is rare that we find any childwith a developmental problem who does not have increased levelsof mercury in the urine after a chelator challenge. An interestingphenomenon is that we are finding many more lead-intoxicatedchildren than blood screens would indicate. And lead amplifies thetoxicity of ethylmercury in the brain. We performed a number of tests on blood, urine, hair, and stool in the autistic children. The abnormal findings that we see in au-tism involving the immune system, GI tract, and central nervoussystem are also seen in mercury poisoning. These include but arenot limited to changes in T lymphocytes, low levels of glutathione,low sulfate levels, IgA deficiency, and the presence of myelin basicprotein antibodies in the brain. The children are responding wellto the use of oral chelators and supplements which take out heavymetals. We are measuring levels in the urine as we treat. Thechanges in the children are remarkable with each dose of achelator. This treatment may take months to complete but thechance for recovery is evident on a daily basis. Because mercury has such far-reaching effects in the destruction of function in many systems of the body, our treatment also in-volves nutritional repletion of cellular chemistry, normalization ofgastrointestinal bacteria, dietary programs and restoration of liverdetoxification systems. Our medical training did not adequately prepare us for this chal- lenge. We have learned little about testing heavy metals and evenless about treating. The word ''chelation'' is not in the vocabulary of most physicians. A few physicians who are treating these chil-dren are inundated with them in their practices now. The goodnews is that they 're responding well to the therapy. The changes VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug are remarkable with each day of treat- ment. It is imperative that we stop giving heavy metals to children through vaccines when their bodies can least handle such an in-sult. We're seeing the link on a daily basis. The children are recov-ering steadily but the treatment is expensive and tedious. It wouldmake more sense for us to eliminate the cause of the problem bydeleting thimerosal from the vaccines now and by withdrawing cur-rent lots containing thimerosal from pediatric offices and healthunits. We also need to channel funds for research into the clinicaltrials needed to explore the link between mercury and develop-mental problems in children. I brought some slides of just a couple of the children before and after treatment. It 's kind of hard to see. The child on the left has a blank stare, he has no speech. On the right he 's smiling. He is now speaking. He 's speaking in sentences. And this is following the nutritional treatment and the removal of metals. Second slide. This is a child before treatment on the left: bleary- eyed, no speech at all, irritable, self-injurious, hands flapping. Andon the right, I think you can see the change. And this child hada lot of metal. He had lead, he had mercury, he had aluminum.We're finding a lot of aluminum in these children. I think alu-minum is going to end up being as big a problem as mercury if wekeep putting it into the vaccines. On the left, again no speech, blank eyes, blank stare, little frown- ing look; and on the right, I think you can see the mother 's smile as well as you can see the child 's smile. This was a twin, by the way. And she now has two speaking twins. One more? OK. I think we 're back to the start. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Cave follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you, Dr. Cave. Sounds like you 're doing real good work down there. We 'll check all the references that you used as well as your statement. Doctor. Mr. A POSHIAN . May I have the first slide, please? Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I have been asked to review mercury toxicity with you for a short period of 5 minutes.And with your permission, I 'll dispense with the usual introductory remarks and get to the point. May I have the next slide, please? The next slide, please.The next slide will tell you about the different forms of mercury. We have elemental mercury, we have organic mercury, and wehave mercuric mercury that we usually call inorganic. The ele-mental mercury you 're probably familiar with as far as the silvery liquid that most children play with at some time in their lives. Itis dangerous because it emits mercury vapor at room temperatureor when it's in our mouth, as we will talk about in a moment. It 's a very dangerous poison. The organic mercury, methylmercury, comes from fish \u2014the fish that you eat, certain kinds of fish. And thimerosal comes from thevaccines and other medical preparations. A recent FDA list pointedout there are 217 medical preparations listed with the FDA thatcontain organic mercurials; 217. And finally, the slide mentions mercuric mercury that we 'll speak about in a moment. As far as the sources and forms of brain mer-cury, this is shown in the next slide. You may not be able to seethat, but on the left is a tooth, underneath is thimerosal, and overto the right hand side is a fish. The greatest exposure to mercuryof the American population comes from the amalgams in theirmouths. This has been clearly established. The mercury amalgamsin your mouth, the so-called silver fillings, contain 48 to 50 percentof elemental mercury. These fillings continuously emit mercuryvapor which will go to the brain and is converted to mercuric mer-cury, as is pointed out there. On the far right-hand side, you 'll see a picture of a fish. Certain fish contain methylmercury; again, very rapidly taken up from theGI tract, transported quickly to the brain, and converted very slow-ly to mercuric mercury. And then on the bottom left-hand side,you'll see thimerosal, which again will be taken up by the brainand quickly converted to mercuric mercury. Now, one of the findings of the recent National Academy of Sciences report is that you really cannot consider any form of mer-cury alone. Let me just read you the one statement from the pre-publication form of this report. It says: Prospective data on allsources of mercury exposure such as vaccines and dental amalgamsand dietary intakes of methylmercury are essential to understand-ing the effects of environmental mercury exposure on any out-comes. May I have the next slide, please? This will show you the target organs of various forms of mercury: mercury vapor of the brain, methylmercury of the brain, thimerosal of the brain, and mercuricmercury if it's taken up from outside of the body, the kidney.What's important to find out is all three of the first three forms are VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug the brain. By neurotoxic, we mean it will damage nerves and it will damage brain tissues. The next slide, please. Neurotoxicity of mercury. I think the first statement is that the mercury stays in the brain. I can 't quite see the slide myself from here. The mercury remains in the brain. Mycolleague, Mary Aposhian, has looked for the last 10 years for com-pounds that would bring mercury out of the brain. There is no suchtherapeutic agent that we know of. Most of the research in thiscountry, as far as getting mercury out of the brain, is supported bythe family of a former Vice President of the United States. It is be-lieved that that Vice President died of mercury toxicity. That fam-ily has done more for studying basic mercury toxicity than probablyany other foundation or government in our country. The most sensitive organs: brain of fetus, brain of children, brain of adults. Again, the brain of the fetus is uniquely susceptible tomercury toxicity, as are the brains of children and the brains ofadults. We're mature. What I would like you to remember is a childis not a small adult. The metabolism, the biology of the child, isquite different. The child has developing organs. The fetus has de-veloping organs. And we know that mercury will stunt certain met-abolic reactions involved in development. The next slide, please. The final slide points out that which dam- ages the brain. Again, the recent National Academy of Science re-port really introduced something quite novel as far as the thinkingof the scientific community. And that is, as you look at all this \u2014 these slides, the central compound, the central form of mercuryhere is mercuric mercury. Mercuric mercury vapor converts intomercuric mercury, thimerosal converts to mercuric mercury, asdoes methylmercury. So this is probably the culprit, mercuric mer-cury. The report points out that we must consider methylmercuryand mercuric mercury as well as thimerosal in order to understandthe neurotoxicity of mercury. Let me just say as a final statement that there is no need to have thimerosal in a vaccine. There are other agents that can beused that are known to be safe. Thank you for your attention.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Doctor. VerDate H UMISTON . Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I applaud your efforts to bring parents, scientists, and policymakers together around the issue of autism. I am grateful for the oppor-tunity to share my perspective as a parent, pediatrician, and publichealth researcher. Last week, my baby Quinn demonstrated developmental skills that thrilled my husband and me. He pulled his father 's hand to- ward a pile of rocks, used his other hand to point toward a puddle,and said, ''dad ock bla-bla,'' which meant, ''Daddy, throw this rock in the water.'' Unfortunately, Quinny is 7 12years old. The worst day of my life was not the day the developmental pedi- atrician told me, almost apologetically, that my son was autistic.The worst day came later when the specialists told me that Quinn 's progress was minimal after a year and a half of intense therapy,and that this made his prognosis grave. My family 's response was very typical. We reached out and embraced a succession of thera-pies, each touted as a lifesaver. We heard that gluten allergy wasthe cause, and we changed Quinn 's diet. Later we tried, for exam- ple, a phenol-free diet, megavitamins, anti-yeast medications, andcranio-sacral massage. Each therapy was supposed to get at thecause of Quinn's autism. Each therapy was expensive, and each formy son was a failure. You may wonder what would make a reasonable person pursue such an array of untested and unproven approaches. Well, I am adesperate mother. I am desperate to help my son quickly duringhis early years when we 'd expect rapid brain development. I am desperate because the science lags so far behind my son 's needs. My family has been blown by every wind, every theory, to explainthis pervasive developmental disorder, and we are tired. We arephysically tired, financially tired, emotionally tired. So I am heretoday to encourage you to nurture the science that will help, if notmy son, then at least my little girl 's future children. Funding, of course, is a very good way to show support. I appre- ciate the significant increases in NIH funding for autism research.I am grateful for CDC 's investment in vaccine research. Generous and sustained funding for short-term and long-term studies is themost powerful help the government can offer my family. Please domore. I have also a list of please don 'ts. Please don't overemphasize the investigation of some factors because they seem so risky, while ig-noring other potentially important factors. We know, for example,that because vaccination is unpleasantly memorable, we tend toperceive it as riskier than, say, exposure to mercury in fish, whichis not very memorable. Please don 't exhaust your investigation on the mercury in vaccines and ignore the subtler and potentiallymore significant sources of neurotoxicants. Please don 't ignore fac- tors because they are complex or seemingly unalterable. I wouldprefer answers that are correct to answers that are quick and expe-dient. Please don't imagine that shaking public confidence in vaccines won't lead to the death of some children. We know that previouspronouncements on thimerosal led some U.S. birthing centers todiscontinue the use of hepatitis B vaccine and this in turn led to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug chronic infection in newborns. These babies have had about a 9 percent chance of going on to die of liver cancer or cirrho-sis, neither of which are enviable deaths. We know that in the UK and Japan, pertussis vaccines scares led to decreases in vaccination and consequent increases in whoopingcough, a disease that wracks a baby 's body. We cannot forget that just 10 years ago, we saw a measles epidemic in this country thatkilled 123 children. That 's not theoretical. We can count the death certificates. Though Hib disease essentially vanished once the vac-cine was out, I will never forget it \u2014fathers carrying limp, lethargic toddlers into the emergency department. Your actions have con-sequences. Please don 't forget. Please don't miss the opportunity to study the results of remov- ing thimerosal from vaccines. As the manufacturers change to mer-cury-free formulations, I hope someone is doing a definitive studyto see if autism rates plummet. And finally, please don 't ever frame this as a battle of parents against scientists. Generating hypotheses is a first step to findingcauses and cures, and this committee has heard many conflictinghypotheses. The next step, testing these hypotheses, is painfullyslow and costly, but I hope you will commit yourself to this sci-entific process. I believe it holds the greatest hope for my son andthe many children like him. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Humiston follows:] VerDate Thank you for your comments. I 'd just like to say at the outset that nothing that this committee has ever said would indicate, at least from the Chair, that we are opposed to vaccines.We are very much in favor of vaccinations. What we are concernedabout is whether or not the contents of those vaccinations are safeand whether or not they 're being properly followed and looked into by the agencies of jurisdiction, the FDA and the CDC. And we 're also very concerned about whether or not there are conflicts of in-terest between the people on the advisory panels that are makingrecommendations to FDA and the CDC and the pharmaceuticalmanufacturers. I'd like to ask you, Dr. \u2014how do you pronounce your name \u2014 Aposhian. They started using thimerosal in 1930. Mr. A POSHIAN . About that time. Mr. B URTON . I was just wondering, I know this is pure specula- tion, we have a tremendous increase in Alzheimer 's and, because of the neurological problems that many people are seeing from thi-merosal being used in the vaccinations, where this could be a con-tributing factor in the Alzheimer 's increase. Mr. A POSHIAN . There are some scientific papers that speculate about that. But at the present time, it cannot be said that Alz-heimer's disease has been caused by mercury. Mr. B URTON . You think that, along with the aluminum and form- aldehyde and other things that have been in vaccinations for a longtime, should be looked into by the health agencies as possible con-tributing factors? Mr. A POSHIAN . There's no question that mercury does not belong in vaccines. There are other compounds that could be used as pre-servatives. And everything we know about childhood susceptibility,neurotoxicity of mercury at the fetus and at the infant level, pointsout that we should not have these fetuses and infants exposed tomercury. There's no need of it in the vaccines. I think the Academy of Pediatrics has also quite firmly stated there is no need of thimerosal in vaccines. Mr. B URTON . Why\u2014and this is a question for any of you \u2014why was thimerosal put in vaccines in the first place? Does anybodyknow? Why did they put that in there? It was supposed to be a pre-servative. As I read the statements that you made today, it wassupposed to be something that kept bacteria out of the vaccina-tions, out of the vaccines. Mr. A POSHIAN . That's correct, sir. Mr. B URTON . And yet the information that I see here is that it really doesn't. Mr. A POSHIAN . In the early thirties, in fact the 1940 's and up until the mid-1950s, mercurials were used in medicine. They wereused as diuretic agents. The medical community had no evidence \u2014 had nothing better to use. They had nothing better to use as a pre-servative at that time than thimerosal. And I would venture theopinion that it has just been going on because no one has objectedto it. And there's no need for it any longer. And I don 't know any medical community or scientific community that would agree to theneed for having thimerosal in any vaccine. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Enayati said in his statement in 1982, 18 years ago\u2014and it's in the Federal Register \u2014an FDA panel concluded VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 toxic, causes cell damage, can cause allergic re- actions, and is not effective in killing bacteria or halting their rep-lication. That was 18 years ago. Why, if we knew that 18 years ago, did they continue to let that be put into these vaccines? Does anybodyknow the answer to that? Mr. A POSHIAN . I think that's what you should ask the FDA rep- resentative. Mr. B URTON . Oh, I plan to. Now, the hepatitis B vaccine has thi- merosal in it, and that 's given to infants. As I understand it, in- fants don't really have a great deal of exposure to hepatitis B be-cause it's\u2014you can contract it through blood, through sex, orthrough, I guess, needles. Unless the parent has it. So why are wegiving hepatitis B vaccines to infants? Does anybody know that?Unless the parent has it. Would you like to comment, Dr.Humiston? I see you started to move forward. Dr. C AVE. One of the main areas that we need it is when we have a mother who tests positive for hepatitis B. Mr. B URTON . I understand that. Aside from that, why the need to have it? Dr. C AVE. I agree with you. I don 't find the need for it on the day of birth in children who don 't have mothers who are positive. Mr. B URTON . OK. Doctor. Dr. H UMISTON . The day of birth is different than some time dur- ing infancy. We know that in 1990, before universal vaccinationwith hepatitis B, that by age 10 there were 19,000 children in theUnited States that had contracted hepatitis B, even though theirmothers were hepatitis B surface antigen negative. So they have \u2014 it's possible to have exposure to hepatitis B in ways other than perinatally. It's a small number overall. You know, if you look atthe entire population of the United States less than 10 years ofage, but 19,000\u2014and, of course, when you are exposed to hepatitisB during your early life, you 're more likely to go on and be a chron- ic carrier. Mr. B URTON . Have there been studies \u2014and I'll yield to Danny \u2014 or, excuse me, to Mr. Davis in just a minute \u2014but have there been studies showing the various ages at which children contract hepa-titis B? Because it seems to me inconceivable before the age of 6,or 5, that children would really have much exposure to it. I mean,you said below age 10. How about the various age increments? Youdon't know? Dr. H UMISTON . I don't know how it's divided out. Mr. B URTON . Could we check that out and find out what ages we start to see\u2014\u2014 Dr. C AVE. It's very rare if the mother is not hepatitis B-positive that an infant shows hepatitis B. Mr. B URTON . Up until what age, you say 5 or 6? Dr. C AVE. I think it's far beyond that. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Davis, you 're recognized. Mr. D AVIS OF ILLINOIS . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I missed a part of the testimony from some of the witnesses, but thatwhich I heard I found to be quite intriguing. Dr. Aposhian, how long has the scientific community been aware of the alternatives to the use of mercury? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 it depends how you define the scientific com- munity. The academic community, I would say since 1955, has been concerned about the use of mercurials in medicine. The useof mercurials in medicine has had a long history. It used to be usedas a treatment of syphilis. It used to be used for the treatment ofmany, many infectious diseases before we had antibiotics. Mr. D AVIS OF ILLINOIS . I know that there 's often resistance to change, even when something comes along that we can assume orwe might even know to perhaps be more effective, more efficient,less dangerous, less costly or whatever. Can you think of any rea-sons why, if we are aware of the alternatives and if they are safer,why we have not moved assiduously in that direction? Mr. A POSHIAN . Congressman Davis, there are three groups in- volved here, I think. We have an academic group, we have a gov-ernment group, and we have an industrial or pharmaceuticalgroup. Because of our society, most industrial groups, most phar-maceutical companies, are very reluctant to change anything be-cause of the tremendous cost of getting that change through theFDA. And the other concern by pharmaceutical companies is justhow dangerous is dangerous? And that, I think, is where the great-est argument comes in and that 's where the FDA should be acting as a judge. Dr. H UMISTON . I don't mean to be cynical about the pharma- ceutical companies, but I don 't think that they 're going to take to moving toward thimerosal-free vaccines, I don 't think they will be taking financial losses, because one of the things that happens iswe won't be able to have vaccines in multidose vials. Multidosevials are much less expensive than single-dose vials. So going to allsingle-dose vials will actually bring more profits to the pharma-ceutical companies. And I don 't\u2014you know, I am not saying that that's their motive, I 'm simply saying that they have nothing to lose. Mr. D AVIS OF ILLINOIS . But it is in fact, I guess, sometimes dif- ficult to feel that certain kinds of self-interests don 't creep into the ultimacy of decisionmaking. And I guess that 's where it takes\u2014\u2014 Dr. H UMISTON . Again I don't mean to be cynical, but I think that the pharmaceutical companies have moved quite quickly, and part-ly, probably, because they don 't have a great deal to lose. Mr. D AVIS OF ILLINOIS . I guess what you 're saying is no matter how you cut it, you can 't get around the whole concept of ultimate involvement of all of us in arriving at public policy, and that ifthere is enough action and activity, then one part balances out orone side balances out the other and we arrive at the public inter-est. I assume\u2014I also listened to your testimony in terms of your own personal experience, and I was obviously moved, as anybody wouldbe by it. Given your own training as well as the experiences, do youfeel or would you have reason to believe that there might be anyconnection between immunization and autism? Dr. H UMISTON . What Mr. Davis is referring to is that I was for- merly with the National Immunization Program. Now I 'm a pedia- trician at the University of Rochester. I have to say that I try veryhard to keep an open mind scientifically, and I think that that isthe most important stance that we can take now. What I am advo- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 science. And again, I was present during the ACIP meeting, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.I was happy to see that the science is going forward quickly. I hopethat the science can go forward quickly. We 've\u2014this committee has heard other theories as well. And I hope that we come to better un-derstanding\u2014also the genetics. I mean, there 's so many factors here. I think that immunization is just a tiny part, but it sticks inour mind because it 's so memorable. Mr. D AVIS OF ILLINOIS . I thank you very much. Plus, Mr. Chair- man, I must say I was pleased to hear your comment in terms ofthe position of the committee relative to the fact that there are noconclusions having been determined or reached, but what the com-mittee is really hoping to do is to try and probe as deeply, as wide-ly as it can, to try and find out as much as we possibly can aboutthe issue. And I appreciate that comment that you made. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Davis. Ms. Chenoweth. Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As a grand- parent of an autistic child, I 've been fascinated with your testi- mony. I want to thank all of you for the method of your delivery.I know it's difficult. In the last hearing I had difficulty even givingmy own opening statement, and I 'm not a patient, I 'm a grand- parent. But they 're precious, precious little children. And my heart goes out to you. But also I thank you very much for your couragein being here today. I wanted to begin my questioning with a question to Dr. Cave. I've been fascinated with your treatment procedure. And your pro-cedure involves nutritional repletion of cellular chemistry and nor-malization of gastrointestinal bacterial balance, dietary problems,restoration of liver detoxification systems. What do you think aboutchelation also as a treatment? Have you considered that? [The are using oral chelation with a sustained release DMSA. The DMSA is a drug approved by the FDA for lead intoxi- cation in children. We 've used a sustained release form which has given us a totally different picture. We 're pulling on a 24-hour basis now, and we 're seeing the metal come out. And the children are changing in the first week that we start treating. We have another layer of treatment in which we add alphallipoic acid which does take it to the central nervous system. When westart pulling it from the central nervous system, we get sentencesand speech in children who have not spoken. It 's been phenomenal. Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. That was going to be my next question. Can you pull it from the central nervous system? Dr. C AVE. Yes, we can. Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. Is chelation the best method of doing that, have you found? Dr. C AVE. It's the only method. You have to pull the metal with something that will hook on to the metal. And these have \u2014sulf- hydryl groups, which will hook on to mercury. Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. Dr. Cave, I was also interested in know- ing what your thoughts were about why some children are affectedthis way while others perhaps have a physiologic system that 's de- veloped to the point that the toxins don 't reside in the brain. What happens there? Dr. C AVE. We are measuring the detoxification systems in the children's livers and we're finding variability. In the children that we're seeing that are developmentally delayed, there is very little \u2014 they're not able to detoxify very well. There 's very little ability. The normal child has a better system. And we can measure that. Thereare some genetic factors. We have some ideas about that, too. Andwe're looking at several lipoproteins; that 's very early right now. But it can be explained \u2014it can't be fully explained, but it can be partially explained at this point, and there are genetic factors forsure. Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. I see. Mrs. Birt, I found it very interest- ing in your testimony that you testified to the fact that there weresome questions back in 1988 and then finally \u2014about thimerosal \u2014 and then finally in 1997 they issued a final rule, the FDA did, thatdisallowed thimerosal or indicated that products containing thimer-osal were neither effective and may not be safe for over-the-counter\u2014\u2014 Ms. B IRT. Correct. Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE [continuing]. Treatments. And also in your testimony, you talked \u2014you testified to the fact that the FDA asked the vaccine companies to give them information on this. Andcould you elaborate more on that? I found that section of your testi-mony fascinating. Ms. B IRT. I think the problem is that the manufacturers aren 't held accountable, so nobody is responsible in the ultimate product.It's like a big circle. It goes from the manufacturer to the FDA tothe CDC to the public. But nowhere in there is anybody legally orfinancially accountable if there 's a problem. And the way our soci- ety is geared is that profitability is the highest thing. And I think that in order for the vaccine manufacturers to make the product thimerosal-free, they had to change their methods of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug is only speculation \u2014they may have known there was a problem earlier and just didn 't want to say anything. Nobody knows that for sure. But I think this whole process of finding out the truth will lead us to the truth eventually. But I think the fundamental problem is that we don't have accountability in the system, so the peoplewho have the most to lose really aren 't protected, which is basically the job of the government, to protect people who are at risk. Andthat has not been done in this process. Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. Mr. Chairman, I see my time is up. I just wish I had about 3 hours to engage with these witnesses. Mycongratulations to you and your staff for the outstanding informa-tion we've received. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Congresswoman Chenoweth. We 'll have one more round, if you would like to ask some more. Mr. Gilman,Chairman Gilman. Mr. G ILMAN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I regret that I was tied up on the floor with legislation that we 're involved in. And I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman and the committee, for conducting thisseries of hearings on vaccine safety, and I want to thank our panel-ists for coming to voice their concerns and to give us their informa-tion. As we examine the various additives that are present in vac-cines, it's extremely important that we note the role that they playand what, if any, other compounds may be available to fulfill theirroles as appropriate substitutes. Today's hearing focuses on thimerosal, the preservative that con- tains small amounts of mercury. And that 's the first that I 've been made aware of how mercury is part of these vaccine substancesand what they can do to our youngsters. I 've been informed that these preservatives are used to inhibit the growth of bacteria fun-gus that might contaminate a multidose vial of vaccine where aphysician reenters the same vial several times to inoculate severalchildren. Apparently, without preservatives, there is a risk that avial of vaccine could become contaminated and a physician couldinadvertently inject a living organism into a child. Since 1968, I 've been informed preservatives have been required by law inmultidose vials. Thimerosal has been used for more than 60 years in a variety of vaccines. The fact that it 's been used that long, of course, does not attest to its safety. It 's been effective as a preservative in very low doses and highly stable \u2014it is highly stable throughout the shelf life of that vaccine, and works across a broad spectrum of microbialagents. As such, it 's been considered the best preservative that was available. And while its value in keeping vaccines free of contami-nation has been unchallenged, serious questions have now arisenas to the possible side effects in infants from exposure to mercury,the mercury that 's available in thimerosal. It's my understanding that aside from 60 years experience in the field, there has been little directly applicable data on this concernuntil very recently. CDC has now looked at the level of exposureto mercury of immunized infants in three HMOs versus the appear-ance of symptoms such as renal failure, a hallmark of mercury poi-soning, and various neurological deficits, including autism. Thisdata has indicated what there is no association between the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug mercury an infant is exposed to from vaccines in the de- velopment of any neurologic or renal problem. And that 's why it's so important we 're examining this issue today. And another type of additive to vaccines is the adjuvant. Adju- vants in vaccines help boost the child 's immune response to bac- teria or virus that is a poor stimulant of its own accord. Adjuvantstherefore provide the ability to decrease the amount of bacteria orvirus needed in a vaccine and/or to decrease the number of dosesneeded in an immunization series. Aluminum salts, I 've been in- formed, are the only licensed adjuvant in our Nation. They 've been safely used in vaccines for a number of years. Today, taking testimony from our panelists who are before us now regarding adjuvants and additives in vaccines and alleged as-sociations between these additives and various illnesses, is ex-tremely important to us. We must be vigilant in matters of vaccinesafety. We've just gone through extensive hearings on anthrax andtrying to make certain that any utilization of anthrax by the mili-tary is not going to affect their well-being. At the same time, it 's important we focus our attention on scientific evidence. We mustbe careful we don 't jump to conclusions based on anecdotes and speculations, but that 's why it's good you're here to present specific cases to us. We must not lose sight of the fact that vaccines havesaved millions of people from debilitating and deadly diseases, butwe don't want the vaccine itself to cause side effects that are justas deadly. The effect of needlessly scaring parents away from immunizing their children is a real concern, and that 's why we must tread very carefully as we go through this maze of trying to find out just whathas affected our children by the substances that are present in thevaccine. So again I thank Mr. Chairman, thank you for being here, and I want to thank our panelists who are here today to give us thebenefit of their thinking. [The prepared statement of Hon. Benjamin A. Gilman follows:] VerDate Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Ms. R OS-LEHTINEN . Thank you so much, Mr. Burton, for this hearing and for your constant leadership on this terrible issue ofautism. I don't have autistic children, but I have a very good friendwho has, as you may remember, because I 've spoken about them before in this committee, two autistic children. Because of them,these hearings are of great importance to me personally and tomany constituents in my district. Due to my association with herand her family I have come to know so much about autism andhow many families are affected and indeed devastated by this prob-lem. I'm always delighted to go back home with all of your material \u2014 and I want to commend your staff for preparing such fine materialsfor us at each hearing \u2014how happy the parents of autistic children are with the literature, and then when I have the meeting with theso-called experts, how alarmed they are with the papers. I find that there 's a great disconnect in the scientific community about what parents have come to know and understand throughtheir own research and through their own set of circumstance. AndI hope that both sides come closer together because I know that Iwill have that same reaction when I come back to Miami this week-end; that parents will be very happy with this information and theexperts won't. And we do have some very good centers for autism in south Flor- ida. I don't know if there's a geographical connection, but certainlysouth Florida has been very impacted by the effects of autism. Wehave the Card Center at the University of Miami, Center for Au-tism and Related Disabilities, a great center, and the Dan MarinoInstitute in Broward County. So my community has been blessedwith good information. Yet I find that scientists and many withinthe medical community, the people with whom I deal with, they arenot satisfied with the information that we give them. I find thatdisturbing, because I would think that these experts would behappy to see others doing research and promising information. I wanted to followup with a view of the great information that was given to us today. You were saying that in one of the publica-tions, I'm not sure which one, that mercury levels can be detectedin urine, hair, and blood. I'm interested in knowing how many autistic children you believe have been tested for mercury levels? As I said. I have two childrenof my own, they're 14 and 13 now. I don 't recall whether that was a normal set of tests, but whatever it was, it was at a normalrange. Is testing for mercury something that is usually done by pe-diatricians? Do you think that that is something that they shouldbe looking at? Would it involve a more intrusive examination thanis already given to children? Are you advocating that parentsshould have their children tested for mercury levels? That's my first question. Let me just throw them all out and whoever wants to, answer. Also, chelation \u2014is that how you say it? Chelation methods, do they come in pill form or a shot or liquid that the child swallows, and how many children have undergonethis chelation therapy or method? Finally, what was it formulated VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 I 'm interested in understanding more about that therapy. Thank you, whoever would like to answer those questions about mercury testing and chelation therapy and address the disconnect between parents and so-called medical authorities. Dr. C AVE. Mercury is not something that is usually tested, and we were not really taught to test hair samples or to give chelationdoses and test urine samples. If you look at some of the materialI've provided in the handout on the hair samples that I have, youcannot find mercury in these children. We find mercury in the hairof children who are receiving the vaccines, but these children arebeyond the first dose of vaccine. So the mercury has moved beyondthis level. It stays in hair only a certain period of time. It doesn 't actually stay in blood. But when we give the dose of a chelator, it brings it into blood and then into the urine, and then we can measure it in urine. Thisis something that we started doing 4 or 5 years ago when we start-ed treating the children. And I noticed that we were finding metalsin the small children and in children who were receiving the \u2014well, a vaccine like hepatitis B later on in life. I found it in the hair sam-ple of a young man who had the hepatitis B series in college. Hewas left with severe depression, and his brother was left with sei-zure disorder. And I found it in the hair of both of these youngmen. But you have to be able to look for something. You have to know how to look for it in order to find it. When we were using the drugas it's given in the regular drugstore, without technology-sustainedrelease, we were not even finding very much in the urine. Now thatwe're using a sustained release, we 're bringing it out into the urine. If you notice on the handout that I have there, it 's very high in the urine as submitted, even though it was negative in the hair.In the hair, we look for aluminum and we find aluminum and wefind antimony in the hair. And we are treating that \u2014we're not treating that with the same medication. We 're using an over-the- counter to treat the aluminum and it 's working well, with no tox- icity that we can see. Mr. B URTON . Anyone want to comment briefly on the chelation she was talking about, the various forms of chelation? Mr. A POSHIAN . Let me say that our laboratory for the last 18 years has been the primary laboratory dealing with the use ofDMSA, the development of DMSA, the approval of DMSA by theFDA. It's a chelating agent. That means it competes with other ma-terials in the body for a particular metal or group of metals, makesthat metal more soluble, and therefore excretes it. The controversy has always been, just because you get rid of a metal does not necessarily mean you improve the clinical positionof\u2014the clinical condition of the patient. This is always controver- sial. Chelation therapy is certainly not accepted by the vast majority of established medicine. It is accepted quite greatly by alternative medicine people. I think it 's just a subject of controversy at the present time. There is no question at all that it helps children that VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug exposed to lead. It gets rid of the lead and decreases their chances of getting any worse. The National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences at the present time have a $35 million program to see whether givingDMSA to children who have been adversely affected by lead willimprove their condition. As yet there is no solid information thattheir condition has been improved, but all the information is notpresent yet. Chelation therapy has always been a method of getting rid of toxic metals. There are various chelating agents that can be givenby mouth, like DMSA. There are other ones that can be given bymouth or injection. And there are also very toxic ones. I also wantto point out, the problem is that you can 't take an autistic child, give him any kind of an agent, and then test his brain to seewhether that particular toxic metal has been removed. We can dothat in animal studies; we cannot do it in human studies, of course. Does that answer your question, Congresswoman?Ms. R OS-LEHTINEN . Yes. Dr. C AVE. But clinically they 're improving. We 're bringing them back 80 percent, 90 percent, in terms of social interaction withspeech, with eye contact, and that 's proof that the central nervous system is functioning at a higher level. We can 't go in and biopsy the brain, but we can certainly look at the child. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Cummings, you have questions? Well, we have a number of questions I would like to submit for the record to each one of you. You have been very, very informativein your statements and I really appreciate that. I would like to askyou a whole host of questions, but the hour is getting late, and Iknow we're going to have votes on the floor and we 're going to be down there for awhile. So would you all be willing to answer ques-tions for the record that we submit to you? We 'll put those in the record as soon as we get them. I want to thank you all for being here. I hope you can stay around to hear the testimony from the agencies of the government.Thank you very much. We will now have panel No. 2. Ms. E.

BERNIER, ASSOCIATE DIRECTORFOR SCIENCE, NATIONAL IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM, CEN-TERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION; AND DR.MARIE BRISTOL-POWER, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTHAND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OFHEALTH Ms. T ROVATO . Good afternoon. I am Ramona Trovato, Director of the Office of Children 's Health Protection at the U.S. Environ- mental Protection Agency. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to talk about the problem of mercury, particularlyas it affects fetuses and very young children. Mr. Chairman, while I appreciate the primary interest of this committee today is the role that mercury may play in causinghealth effects in children when used as preservatives in vaccines,EPA does not have regulatory authority to address vaccines andtheir preservatives. EPA does have authority to address releases ofmercury to our air, land, and water, and is actively addressingsuch releases through both regulatory and nonregulatory actions. Mercury is a naturally occurring metal which persists in the en- vironment and has long been known to have toxic effects on thenervous systems of humans and wildlife. The most significant re-leases of mercury to the environment in the United States areman-made emissions to the atmosphere from combustion sources,including waste and fossil fuel combustion. Mercury from suchemissions as well as naturally occurring mercury and mercury frompast uses, such as in fungicides on crops, is deposited into the soiland water. Concentrations of mercury in air and water are usuallylow and of little direct health concern. Once mercury enters water,however, it may be converted to methylmercury which can then ac-cumulate in fish and marine animal tissue. Methylmercury levelsin fish at the top of the food chain are, an average, 7 million timeshigher than the concentrations of dissolved methylmercury foundin the surrounding waters. As a result, human exposure tomethylmercury occurs primarily through eating contaminated fish.The amount of methylmercury that people are exposed to dependson the species of fish consumed, the concentration ofmethylmercury in the fish, and how much and how often fish areconsumed. While most U.S. consumers need not be concerned about their ex- posure to methylmercury, some exposures may be of concern. Thosewho frequently consume large amounts of fish or who eat fish fromwater contaminated with mercury may be more highly exposed.Populations such as pregnant women and their fetuses may be atrisk if they consume large amounts of contaminated fish or fishwith relatively high levels of methylmercury. Because the developing fetus is the most sensitive to the effects of methylmercury, women of childbearing age may be at particularrisk. These women should pay attention to the fish advisories VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug their States that suggest limiting the consumption of fish containing higher levels of methylmercury. Methylmercury is toxic to adults, children, and the fetus but pre- natal and postnatal exposure can adversely affect the nervous sys-tem. Dietary methylmercury is almost completely absorbed into theblood and distributed to all tissues, including the brain. It alsoreadily passes through the placenta to the fetus and fetal brain. Ef-fects on the fetal nervous system occur at lower exposures than doeffects on the adult nervous system. Mercury interferes with thedevelopment and function of the central nervous system, withhealth consequences ranging from subtle to severe, depending onthe amount and timing of exposure. In 1995, EPA published a reference dose of 0.1 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day, based on the effects seen in chil-dren following methylmercury consumption by the mother duringpregnancy. Just last week, the National Academy of Sciences released their findings on the health effects of methylmercury based on its eval-uation of recent epidemiological studies. The NAS affirmed EPA 's reference dose is a scientifically justifiable level for public healthprotection for the most sensitive subpopulation \u2014mothers and their unborn fetuses. The NAS has also indicated that the majority ofU.S. population has low risk of adverse effects from currentmethylmercury exposures. However, the NAS also estimated thatmore than 60,000 children are born each year at risk of adverseneurodevelopmental effects such as overall cognitive ability, lan-guage development, spatial perceptual skills, and motor skills dueto in utero methylmercury exposure. EPA is taking action to reduce mercury in the environment. EPA has issued standards that limit air emissions of mercury. The agen-cy has developed regulations for boilers, process heaters, solidwaste combustors and chlor-alkali plants. The remaining largestidentified source of mercury emissions are coal-fired utility boilers. In summary, it is clear that women of childbearing age should take steps to minimize their exposure to methylmercury from eat-ing contaminated fish. People who regularly eat fish should beaware of any State fish advisories. Because of the beneficial effectsof fish consumption, the long-term goal needs to be reduction of theconcentration of methylmercury in fish rather than the replace-ment of fish in the diet by other foods. EPA will continue to takesteps to further improve public health, especially to protect chil-dren and fetuses, our most susceptible population. Thank you very much, and I 'll be happy to answer questions. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Ms. Trovato. Dr. Egan. Mr. E GAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the com- mittee. I am William Egan, the Acting Director for FDA 's Office of Vaccine Research and Review. I appreciate this opportunity to dis- cuss additives in childhood vaccines. I will focus my current re-marks on thimerosal. I ask that my full written statement be en-tered into the record. Mr. B URTON . Without objection, so ordered. Mr. E GAN. Let me say that I am sympathetic to the concerns of the parents expressed by the previous panel. FDA will continue towork with parents and other public health agencies to foster theresearch and data necessary to determine the causes, treatmentand hopefully prevention of autism. Vaccines licensed by FDA have been protecting children in the United States from deadly infections for well over 50 years andhave been credited for saving more lives and preventing more ill-nesses than any other medical treatment. The risk of childhood dis-eases from failure to vaccinate far outweighs exposure to thimero-sal in vaccines. Prior to licensure each vaccine undergoes a thor-ough review, and FDA considers all vaccines currently available tobe both safe and effective. Preservatives are added to vaccines to help minimize the con- sequences of inadvertent microbial contamination, and with certainexceptions the use of preservatives is required by regulation for allmultidose formulations. Thimerosal is an effective preservativewhich has been used in vaccines and other products since the1930's. Requirements for preservatives in multidose vaccine formulations exist in many countries, not just in the United States, and havearisen as a result of tragic experience when bacterially contami-nated vaccines were inadvertently administered to children. Whilethe use of thimerosal does not absolutely eliminate the possibilityof bacterial contamination, it markedly reduces its likelihood. The FDA has been actively addressing the issue of thimerosal as a preservative in vaccines. A review of thimerosal by FDA andother Public Health Service agencies last year found no evidence ofharm from its use in vaccines. Nevertheless, because of concernsabout the potential exposure of infants to mercury from all sources,in July 1999 the Public Health Service, in concert with the Amer-ican Academy of Pediatrics, urged vaccine manufacturers to reduceor eliminate thimerosal in vaccines. Much progress has been madeto this end over this past year. Let me focus on the routine recommended immunizations given to children in their first 6 months of life. Last year at this time thi-merosal was present in both of the licensed hepatitis B vaccines;in some, type B Haemophilus influenza, DTaP vaccine, and that isthe vaccine for diptheria, tetanus and pertussis. Since last summer,thimerosal has been eliminated or reduced by more than 96 percentin the pediatric hepatitis B vaccines. With regard to the Haemophilus vaccines, Wyeth-Lederle has announced that theywill be manufacturing only their thimerosal-free single-doseHaemophilus formulation. The other Haemophilus vaccines are al-ready thimerosal-free is a combination vaccine Haemophilus VerDate Haemophilus vaccines now being manu- factured are thimerosal-free. Let me now turn to the four DTaP vaccines. The DTaP vaccine from SmithKline Beecham does not contain thimerosal as a pre-servative, and both Wyeth-Lederle and Aventis Pasteur have an-nounced that they will be submitting license supplements to FDAfor thimerosal-reduced vaccines either this month, later thismonth, or in August. North American Vaccines has begun discus-sions with the agency on a thimerosal-free formulation. FDA iscommitted to the expedited review of these applications, and hope-fully in early 2001 will have additional thimerosal-reduced DTaPvaccines. Various Federal agencies, including FDA, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Dis-ease Registry, have been addressing the health risks of mercury,particularly methyl mercury. Thimerosal is a derivative of ethylmercury, a closely related compound. It is important to note thatthere are no convincing data or evidence of any harm caused by thelevel of exposure that some children may have encountered follow-ing the existing immunization schedule. FDA 's Office of Vaccines continues to urge manufacturers to develop new vaccines withoutthimerosal as a preservative and to remove or reduce thimerosalcontent in existing license vaccines. Based in part on the substantial progress that has been made in the reduction of thimerosal for vaccines in this past year, theAmerican Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy ofPediatrics and the Public Health Service in consultation with itsAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices recently reaffirmedits goal set last year to greatly reduce or remove thimerosal fromvaccines as rapidly as possible. The group also stated that the riskof not vaccinating children with DTaP or the remaining HIB vac-cine is believed to far outweigh the risk, if any, of the thimerosalin them. Childhood vaccines have been a success story. Without vaccina- tions, children would be at a high risk of contracting many seriouspreventable childhood diseases. It makes good sense to remove thi-merosal from vaccines, and we are committed to that goal, and weare rapidly reaching that goal. While we are continuing to work toremove thimerosal from childhood vaccines, we need to do this safe-ly. Thank you for the opportunity to testify, and I will be glad to an- swer any questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Egan follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 We have some votes on the floor. How many votes are there? Three. We have three votes on the floor, and I really apologize, but we will probably have to run down there for thosevotes. Rather than have you start your testimony, Dr. Bernier, Ithink we will go ahead and recess now, and we will be back in 25minutes. We stand in recess. [Recess.]Mr. B URTON . If we can get the doors closed, please, and get ev- eryone to return to the hearing. I apologize for being away for solong. Dr. Bernier.Dr. B ERNIER . Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I am Dr. Roger Bernier, Associate Director for Scienceof the National Immunization Program at the Centers in DiseaseControl and Prevention. In opening, I would like to emphasize that we in the National Immunization Program have deep empathy for all of the parentswho have experienced the devastating disorder that is autism. It isimpossible for us who have devoted their lives to the health andwell-being of children not to be affected and touched by the per-sonal stories and hardships that lie behind every child and familyaffected by autism. Because of their enormous contributions to the health and well- being of children, vaccines have been frequently cited as one of thegreatest public health achievements in the 20th century. The intro-duction and widespread use of vaccines have prevented millions ofcases of childhood diseases and millions of premature deaths.Thanks to vaccines, there are few visible reminders of how seriousand deadly vaccine-preventable diseases can be. The graphic im-pact of pertussis, another disease that was quite prevalent prior tothe development and use of an effective vaccine, is detailed in mywritten testimony, and I would like if my written testimony can bepart of the record. As a world leader in the licensing of new vaccines, the United States places a high priority on safety and efficacy. The steps thatwe have taken with respect to thimerosal illustrate how much wevalue vaccine safety. The Public Health Service in collaborationwith the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Acad-emy of Family Physicians set a goal for the removal or significantreduction of thimerosal as a preservative for all vaccines routinelyadministered to children in the first year of life. We took this ac-tion even though there was no scientific data showing such expo-sure caused any harm. The risk of harm from thimerosal in vaccines remains largely theoretical. However, because it is feasible to produce vaccines thatdon't need thimerosal-based preservatives, we set the goal of mov-ing as swiftly as possible to a thimerosal-preservative-free child-hood immunization schedule while ensuring that children continueto receive the immunizations necessary to prevent disease. Since last June we have made significant progress toward achieving thatgoal. Six of the seven vaccines recommended for routine use do notcontain thimerosal as a preservative, including the four vaccinesthat never did. By early 2001 we expect to have an adequate thi- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug of the routinely rec- ommended childhood vaccines. Since last July, the CDC has also undertaken a number of stud- ies to understand the potential human health effects, if any, fromexposure to thimerosal in vaccines. Using medical histories fromthe Vaccine Safety Datalink, investigators screened more than100,000 children. They wanted to see if any statistical associationscould be found between exposure to ethyl mercury in thimerosal-containing vaccines and those conditions most likely to be relatedto this type of exposure, that is kidney or neurologic conditionsfound in the medical records. The researchers looked at 17 differentdiagnostic codes. They found five inconclusive correlations betweenthimerosal exposure and the codes for language delays, speechdelays, attention deficit disorder, unspecified developmental delaysand tics. Importantly, however, this screening study did not findany evidence of any increased association between these conditionsamong premature infants, nor did it find any associations betweenthimerosal exposure and autism. An independent expert review of the screening study with the five inconclusive correlations was also undertaken. Twelve expertsfrom outside the CDC evaluated the methods used and the resultsobtained. The consultants were unanimous in agreeing that theavailable evidence taken as a whole failed to meet the set of cri-teria necessary to establish that thimerosal caused the adversehealth effects examined in these studies. We did not stop here, however. Good science involves trying to reproduce findings. We thus arranged to analyze information fromanother managed care organization to see if the five inconclusivecorrelations in the initial screening study could be duplicated in asimilar yet completely separate data base. The second study foundno statistically significant positive correlation between speech, lan-guage and attention deficit disorders and exposure to mercury fromthimerosal-containing vaccines. The direction of the findings is re-assuring as it does not confirm the earlier observations. To help us continue to address concerns about vaccine safety, CDC and NIH are contracting with the Institute of Medicine to es-tablish a standing committee on vaccine safety. And I believe, Mr.Chairman, this is partly in response to the request that you hadmade with Congressman Waxman from the last hearing. There aresteps very far along to move toward working with IOM to look atthese vaccine safety concerns. This IOM committee will meet sev-eral times each year to assess any new evidence about possible ad-verse health effects from vaccines and to determine which vaccinesafety concerns are a priority for further followup. The first issuewe will seek to be taken up by the committee will be to review theavailable information about vaccines, including thimerosal and au-tism. Mr. Chairman, I recognize that a call for more research can be discouraging for parents with autistic children who feel that theycannot wait another day before doing something about this illness,but information which is not the right information only sends par-ents and families down the wrong paths. The history of science isreplete with hypotheses and touted cures that have not panned out.If we hope to accurately identify and effectively address the causes VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug and disorders, we must continue to trust the tools that have served us well, in this case the most rigorous scientific meth-ods possible. In summary, I would like to reiterate three key points from my testimony. First, the introduction and widespread use in theUnited States of vaccines against many childhood diseases haveprevented hundreds of millions of cases of disease and millions ofdeaths. Second, vaccine safety has been and is a high priority at the CDC and other Federal agencies. The vaccines produced and li-censed in the United States meet the highest standards of safetyand efficacy in the world. Third, there is currently no persuasive scientific evidence which establishes a causal link between vaccines and autism or vaccinesand any neurodevelopmental outcome. It is imperative that chil-dren continue to receive all of the recommended vaccines in themost timely manner possible. Doing so will assure the greatest pos-sible level of protection from the still circulating viruses and bac-teria that cause serious and potentially deadly childhood diseases. Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to answer any further questions that you or the other Members may have. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. [The prepared statement of RISTOL -POWER . Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I am Dr. Marie Bristol-Power, coordinator of the Network on the Neurobiology and Genetics of Autism at the National Institute ofChild Health and Human Development at the NIH. I am pleasedto address the committee on the topic on NIH autism research andvaccines. Autism is a complex disease, and a variety of influences, genetic, infectious, immunological, metabolic and possibly environmental,have been implicated as causes or triggers for autism. We believethat no single cause can account for all cases of autism, nor thatany one treatment or cure will prevent or treat effectively all of itsmanifestations. Autism might be better understood as a class ofdisorders. Solving the puzzle of autism will be like peeling anonion, one layer at a time. Current consensus is that autism probably involves multiple genes interacting in some complex way that makes individuals sus-ceptible to autism or autism spectrum disorders. The scientificchallenge is to identify both the genetic basis underlying the dis-order and the environmental influences that might precipitate au-tism in a genetically susceptible individual. Autism has two modes of presentation: One, the symptoms are apparent from birth. In the second the child apparently developsnormally and then loses functional speech and socialization some-where between 18 and 24 months of age. At this time there is noproven explanation for why children who develop normally losespeech and communication or speech and socialization. However,like the overall etiology of autism, there is likely to be a varietyof causes for autistic regression. Recent reports both in the literature and testimony from this committee have raised the possibility of a link between autism andvaccinations, particularly the MMR vaccine, and between autismand vaccine additives. Since it is clear that vaccines are safe andeffective for the vast majority of children, such reports raise thequestion of whether or not some children may suffer adverse eventsfrom vaccines which are helpful to the vast majority of childrenwho receive them. The results of current study are inadequate to draw conclusions which would have far-reaching effects on children vaccination pro-grams so important to the health of America 's children. NIH is tak- ing a number of different approaches to get information as soon aspossible that will determine the merit of these recent concerns. In addition to pursuing our ongoing research on a variety of dif- ferent causes for autism, NICHD, with cofunding from the CDC, isbeginning a study of regression in autism. A thousand persons withautism will be evaluated through the Network on the Neurobiologyand Genetics of Autism of the Collaborative Programs of Excellencein Autism which are supported by Child Health and the Instituteon Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. We will identifya number of\u2014200 children with documented regressive autism, andthey will be compared with matched groups of children with earlyonset autism and with normally developing children. We will thencompare across these groups early onset autism, regressive autism,and normal development; the presence, absence, duration of normal VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 vaccination history of children and of mothers over the course of the pregnancy; measles antibody lev-els and any association of vaccine additives and autism. The as-sessments will be done independently with blind assessments, andwe will reexamine the hypotheses raised by investigators such asDrs. Singh, Wakefield and O 'Leary. No one study can be definitive. Recent work by CDC is important and informative. We are also eagerly awaiting reports from the American Academy of Pediatricsand a report from the group founded by the National Academy ofSciences and the National Institute of Medicine, which is importantbecause it will be an ongoing committee. This retrospective re-search and the reviews will provide valuable information. However,what is really needed is a prospective longitudinal study that willfollow a minimum of 100,000 to 150,000 children and youth frompregnancy through at least 21 years of age so we can find out whatthe interaction of genes and environment are that result in autism. We stand ready to work with you, with Congress, with parent ad- vocacy groups, scientists and individual families so that no stoneis left unturned for us to uncover the causes of autism, includingthe causes of autistic regression. I am pleased to answer any questions you might have.Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Would you put that slide up there, please. I don't know if you can see that slide or not, but it shows the growth of autism in America, and if you can look at that real close- ly, you will see that in the 1940 's up through the 1970 's, there was a gradual growth, and then it started to climb. The HIV vaccinewas introduced in the late 1980 's, and the hepatitis B vaccine was introduced, and we used to have somewhere between 1 child in2,000 was autistic, and now it is close to 1 in 150. Some peoplewould say that is darn near an epidemic. What I would like to ask is if this thimerosal is not a problem, why are you phasing it out of the vaccines? Mr. E GAN. Although I am not aware of any convincing data on harm from the thimerosal that is in vaccines \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Mercury. Mr. E GAN [continuing]. From mercury in vaccines, we are none- theless committed to removing mercury, all sources of mercury,from children. And we are also concerned about potential risks andI guess some of the data that are making people more concernedin recent years about the effect of low levels of mercury. Mr. B URTON . My grandson in 1 day got 62 times what was an acceptable level. In 1 day. Let me ask you about this quote. In 1982, 18 years ago, as de- tailed in the Federal Register, and you can look this up, FederalRegister volume No. 42, an FDA panel concluded that thimerosalis toxic, causes cell damage, can cause allergic reactions and is noteffective in killing bacteria or halting their replication. That was 18years ago, and yet you keep saying there is no conclusive evidence.Why is that? Mr. E GAN. That report in the Federal Register was referring to the use of thimerosal, these organicmercurics, in topical materials. Mr. B URTON . Not given internally? Mr. E GAN. Like mercurochrome. Mr. B URTON . It is bad on the outside, so you give it on the in- side? Mr. E GAN. In high concentrations. Yet it is effective as a preserv- ative in biologics. It has continued to be used as a preservative insome of the eye drops. Mr. B URTON . You know, one of the things that concerns me, Doc- tor, is that\u2014you say that mercury in vaccines has not been provento be a problem. How do you account for this dramatic rise? Do youthink that is all genetics? Mr. E GAN. I don't know the causes of the rise. Mr. B URTON . You will admit it is a dramatic rise? Mr. E GAN. It is dramatic, and I would agree with your assess- ment as epidemic. Mr. B URTON . And mercury is a poison? Mr. E GAN. Yes, it is. It is neurotoxic. Mr. B URTON . And the FDA and the CDC are committed to phas- ing it out. Why not take it out today; 8,000 children are going tobe immunized today. We understand that there is a supply forevery child in America of nonmercury-oriented drugs. Why is itthat we are not phasing it out today? Mr. E GAN. There are a couple of things. If I can first address its use as a preservative, it is an effective preservative, and it is dem- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 preservative. All of the preservatives that are used in vaccines are required to meet the USP definitionof a preservative, meaning that the test article, the vaccine withthe preservative in it, is taken. There are five challenge organismsthat are added, there are three bacteria and two fungi, and theseare added at 0.1 milliliter of each of the bacteria and fungi in aconcentration between 100,000 and a million organisms, and within14 days the preservative is required to reduce the bacterial countby 99.9 percent. Mr. B URTON . Let me interrupt you there. As I understand it, if you take a vaccine that is a single vaccine, not a multiple vaccine,in one shot, that the preservative that you are talking about eitherisn't necessary, or you don 't have to use something like mercury; is that correct? Mr. E GAN. That's correct. Mr. B URTON . It is a single shot. Mr. E NAYATI . A single-dose vial. Mr. B URTON . Why don't we do that? Mr. E GAN. That is primarily what is being done. Most of the changes that have been brought about since last summer havebeen the conversion of vaccines from multidose vials or even single-dose that did contain \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . If we have a supply on hand to take care of the needs of the American people and the children, why are we con-tinuing to put mercury in their bodies? Why don 't we stop now? Dr. Bernier. Dr. B ERNIER . I would like to try to answer that question, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Sure. Dr. B ERNIER . It is a good question, and it is one that we believe we would answer in the following way. We have set a goal to re-move thimerosal from vaccines. We do not disagree with anyonewho believes that this material should be taken out as rapidly aspossible. We have set that goal. And I think we are pleased by thesubstantial progress that has been made and documented heretoday. Last year at this time a child could receive 187.5micrograms of ethyl mercury from vaccines. Today that maximumis down to 75 micrograms. We have, since last summer, nowreached a point where six of the seven vaccines are free of thimero-sal as a preservative, and we believe the seventh one will be assoon as 6 to 9 months now, which is in early 2001. Mr. B URTON . Seventy-five micrograms, 1.5 is considered safe. Dr. B ERNIER . I am not sure where you get that value, Mr. Chair- man. Mr. B URTON . For a 33-pound child, according to what we have found through our research, 1.5 micrograms is what is acceptable. Dr. B ERNIER . I need to emphasize that there is no data, there is no compelling evidence at this time of any harm that has come toany child from vaccines that contain thimerosal as a preservative. Mr. B URTON . How do you account for that graph over there? Do you think that is a coincidence? Dr. B ERNIER . I would like to defer that to Dr. Bristol-Power. I think this is a question about autism and the increasing rates ofautism, and she is best qualified to comment on that. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug make one more comment. Of the 11 mem- bers on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, of the 11 members, 6 of them have financial interests of one kind or an-other in the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture these vac-cines. That doesn 't look good to the public. Now, it may or may not be something that we should be concerned about, but it does con-cern a lot of people that we are keeping mercury that isn 't nec- essary in vaccines when we have a supply that doesn 't have to have those\u2014that mercury in there. At the same time, the commit-tee that is making the advisory panel that makes recommendationsto CDC, over half of them have financial interests in the pharma-ceutical companies. We checked for the past 10 years, and everyone of the recommendations by the advisory panels has been ac-cepted by FDA and CDC; so what they say is pretty much law.Now, how do you account for that? Dr. B ERNIER . I think there are several questions in your last statement. Let me tackle the issue about conflict of interest whichI think you are raising. I am not responsible primarily for the management of that com- mittee or have any direct responsibilities. The only thing I can sayto you is, as I understand it, there are laws and regulations aboutwho can serve on committees, and CDC is currently, as I under-stand it, following those procedures and has gotten a vote of con-fidence about how they are doing on that. I am not qualified tocomment about that. In our society it is possible under the law tohave conflicts of interest, and there are procedures for dealing withthose. On the issue of whether or not we could move more quickly, we believe substantial progress has been made. We have set the goal,and we think that we have the right goal. We think that we havemade substantial progress. If we were to move too precipitously,there would be consequences to pay. We know from the hepatitisB experience that occurred last summer that children fall throughthe cracks and that there is disease that is resulting as a con-sequence. So we don 't want to move to this transition in a way that in some way jeopardizes the health of children, because we are con-fident that that will happen if we move too precipitously. So we are on the right course. We have made tremendous progress, and we are going to get there in the foreseeable future.We should stay the course. Mr. B URTON . Ms. Chenoweth, and could you yield to me for about 10 seconds? Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. Yes. Mr. B URTON . Let me just say that 8,000 children are immunized today. You are phasing out thimerosal. You know there is a prob-lem. You are not saying it, but you know there is a problem. Youhave a supply on hand that does not require having mercury in it,and yet you continue to use mercury, mercury-oriented vaccines. It makes no sense. You have a supply to do it, and the FDA is notstopping this immediately, I submit, because there is a financial in-terest by a lot of pharmaceutical companies that have a large sup-ply of this mercury-oriented vaccine still in stock. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I may ask you for a second and maybe a third round of questions. I have a lot of questions to ask these witnesses. I do want to open up my questioning by making a statement that I have a staffer who is in the Navy Reserve right now, but he usedto be active with the airborne divisions, and he was in for a testin one of the medical military hospitals, and upon taking his tem-perature, they broke a thermometer, and mercury splattered acrosshis glasses and some got in his eye. Well, the first thing they didwas cutoff his clothes. The second thing was call in OSHA to cleanup the mercury. And then they worked on him to make sure hiseyes were irrigated, and you guys, you witnesses, absolutely amazeme. I wonder where the disconnect is, for Pete 's sake. You listened to the testimony just as I did, and you are willing to, with a straight face, tell us that you are eventually going tophase this out after we know that a small baby 's body is slammed with 62 times the amount of mercury that it is supposed to have,and OSHA reacts like they did in the case of this accident of thisnaval man. It doesn 't make sense. No wonder people are losing faith in their government. And to have one of the witnesses tell usit is because mothers eat too much fish? Come on. We expect youto get real. We heard devastating testimony in this hearing today, and we heard it last April. And this is the kind of response we get fromour government agencies? I am sorry.When I was a little girl, my daddy talked to me about something about a duck test. I would ask each one of you to read this veryexcellent work by Sallie Bernard and Albert Enayati, who testifiedhere today. My daddy used to say if it walks like a duck and talkslike a duck and sounds like a duck, for Pete 's sake it is a duck. I recommend that you read this. Side by side, page after page of analysis of the symptoms of people who are affected with mercurypoisoning compared to autism, this is the duck test, and you folksare trying to tell us that you can 't take this off the market when 8,000 children are going to be injected tomorrow; 80 children maybe coming down, beginning tomorrow, with autism? What if therewas an E. coli scare? What if there was a problem with an auto-mobile? The recall would be like that. We are asking you to do more than analyze it. We are asking you to tell this body and the American people that it is more inconclu-sive. It passes the duck test, and we need you to respond. We needthat to come off the market now because you think that this is \u2014 do you think that we are elevating the case today? Just wait untilit gets in the courts. This case could dwarf the tobacco case. Andwe would expect you to do something now before that circus startstaking place. Denial is not proper right now. I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Mr. Waxman. Mr. W AXMAN . Dr. Bristol-Power, you are an expert on autism, someone well versed on the literature of autism. Can you tell us your position on the possible connection between vaccines and au-tism? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Based on the evidence right now, we are looking at any evidence linking vaccines and autism, particularly the MMR vaccine and autism and additives in autism. Some veryserious concerns have been raised both in recent literature reportsand in evidence and testimony before this committee. So we are be-ginning a study right now to look very seriously at whether or notthere is a link that should be \u2014that can be substantiated in a large group of 1,000 patients with well-documented autism. We will becollecting behavioral measures and biological measures that will betested in an independent laboratory that will reexamine thehypotheses that have been raised here. We are taking seriously thetestimony of this committee and are reacting, we hope, with mosthaste to get answers to the questions that you have raised. Mr. W AXMAN . I think that is worthwhile because we want to make sure that we have checked everything out and evaluatewhether this hypothesis is accurate or not that there is some con-nection, but up to now haven 't you and other scientists looked at the connection between vaccines and autism, and have you foundevidence to connect the two? Or are the reports accurate that saythat autism might occur very early on in fetal development andthat the connection appears because the time of autism manifestingitself in the child is pretty close to the time that immunizations aregiven? Ms. B RISTOL -POWER . There are a couple of aspects. Historically, the vast majority of children have symptoms of autism from birth,so for that group certainly the later onset associated with any vac-cines would not be compatible. We have a group of children that do regress that we know de- velop normally and lose speech and social interaction. At this pointwe don't have a satisfactory answer why they regress. But thereare a variety of developmental disorders which are characterized bya period of normal development and regression. For example, thereis a disorder called glutaricacidemia. It is a metabolic disorder. Thechildren develop normally, and without treatment essentially itblows out their basal ganglia, and they become very disabled, andthat is a metabolic cause. There are genetic disorders. Rett syndrome, those children de- velop normally, and then only gradually develop autistic character-istics. We now know there is a genetic basis for that. We have tobe careful in assuming that because the onset is later, it nec-essarily is associated with something that happened later. Mr. W AXMAN . I appreciate that, but I want to ask another ques- tion of Dr. Bernier. On this issue of mercury, mercury is beingtaken out of vaccines, and I think that is a good thing because weshould always err on the side of safety. The question that I wouldlike to ask, and I am sure parents want to know, is this being donebecause there are known adverse related events or as a precaution-ary measure? CDC convened an expert panel to examine data thatshowed a possible weak link between thimerosal and certain devel-opmental delays. The panel presented its findings to CDC 's Advi- sory Committee on Immunization Practices and concluded thatdata were insufficient to show a causal connection between thimer-osal and certain developmental delays. Is that true? Is that the po-sition that CDC has taken? VerDate That's correct, Mr. Waxman. At the present time CDC has no evidence of harm to any children from thimerosal in vaccines. We have constantly acted to look at the safety. Followingthe episode last summer, CDC did begin to look at the data in theVaccine Safety Datalink, and one of the outcomes that we lookedat was autism, and there was no suggestion of any association be-tween thimerosal exposure and autism in the Vaccine SafetyDatalink study. Mr. W AXMAN . Dr. Egan, is the FDA removing thimerosal from vaccines in response to evidence of actual harm or as a precaution-ary measure? Mr. E GAN. It is done as a precautionary measure and to reduce mercury exposure from all sources, vaccines included. Mr. W AXMAN . I see my time has expired. Mr. B URTON . You say that you are doing it as a precautionary measure. When did FDA and CDC first start being concerned aboutmercury in vaccines? Mr. E GAN. I guess the major concern started somewhere around May 1999. Mr. B URTON . May 1999. When you look back at the statement, and you were talking about a topical mercury a while ago, but in1982, the FDA panel concluded that thimerosal is toxic, causes celldamage, can cause allergic reactions and is not effective in killingbacteria or halting their replication. If that was true for a topicalmercury substance, why would you not be concerned about that ifit was ingested? Mr. E GAN. Those topicals refer to high concentrations. Mr. B URTON . I understand, but we are talking about pretty high concentrations; are we not? Mr. E GAN. I will have to look up and get back to you exactly what the concentrations were. Mr. B URTON . I wish you would, because it doesn 't say what the concentrations were. Like I said, we had testimony today from peo-ple that said that their children were getting 125 times, 75 timeswhat EPA and others say is \u2014and CDC says is a safe amount of mercury into their bodies. If in 1982 you knew there was a problemand you didn't know the amounts for a topical, why would you con-tinue to allow vaccinations to be given to children by the millionswhen there was a concern? I mean, I just don 't understand. You say in 1999 you became concerned about it, but in 1982 in the Fed-eral Register you had an FDA panel that said, hey, this is a prob-lem. They said it is toxic. It causes cell damage and can cause al-lergic reactions. This was a topical. Why would you allow it to beinside a vaccination? Mr. E GAN. It was allowed because it is effective as a preservative for those vaccines, and the dose was markedly reduced relative tothose topicals. Mr. B URTON . But you knew mercury was toxic, and there had been an FDA panel that said it was a problem, yet nobody overthere said, we ought to take a look at this as far as vaccinationsare concerned? Mr. E GAN. I don't know. I don't know what people said. Mr. B URTON . When this panel reached its conclusions and put it in the Federal Register, did anybody say, hey, if it is bad for the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug we giving it to them on the inside? Or was maybe the pharmaceutical companies that made it as a preservative andit was in the vaccines saying that they had to keep it in there. Canyou do some research and find out what happened during thistimeframe? I can 't imagine in 1982, 18 years ago, realizing that this was a real problem, continuing to keep it in vaccinations. Mr. E GAN. It was kept in other materials at that time as a pre- servative, not as an active ingredient. Mr. B URTON . When did they start taking it out of over-the- counter stuff? Mr. E GAN. I will have to get back to you on all of those. I believe it is still in ophthalmics \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Many of the over-the-counter \u2014\u2014 Mr. E GAN [continuing]. As preservatives. Mr. B URTON . Many of the over-the-counter drugs they have taken it out of at FDA request. In 1998, they said that it was nolonger generally recognized as safe, and yet here we are 2 yearslater, and you are phasing it out. You are phasing it out. This is the thing that Mr. Waxman and I may not agree, but I cannot understand, maybe you can explain, if there is any questionabout mercury in vaccine, if there is even a question, you are phas-ing it out because there is a question. You have a supply of all thevaccines that are necessary to immunize children of this country.You have that. You have them now. Why in the world are you con-tinuing to immunize kids with something that is questionable?Give me an answer. I don 't understand it. Mr. E GAN. To date there is no \u2014we have no evidence, convincing evidence, of harm from the thimerosal in vaccines. Mr. B URTON . Doctor, I understand you have said that. The point is that you have a supply that you don 't have to worry about, and you have a supply that you are phasing the mercury out of becausethere is concern. You don 't agree that there is scientific evidence. If you are phasing it out, why in the world not use what you knowto be safe so that the kids of this country can be safe? Mr. W AXMAN . Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that you be given an additional minute, because I think you have asked akey question. Why not take it off now? Dr. B ERNIER . I think a couple of things need to be pointed out. First of all, we have concerns about reliance on a single manufac-turer. There are issues about whether or not that single manufac-turer could gear up rapidly enough to move from being a partialprovider of our national need to being the exclusive provider for theentire country. We have concerns about wether or not they canreally do what they say they can do. That is No. 1. No. 2, we have concerns when we rely on a single manufacturer about problems that can occur in production, in meeting the re-quirements of the FDA. There have been episodes where therehave been a fire in a plant. There have been episodes where therehas been disruptions in the manufacture, and there have beenshortages. So we have concerns that if we transition our vaccinesupply too abruptly, we are taking a gamble. We are afraid wemight lose and risk the health of children. There is also an issue about public policy, and we believe that whenever possible we should try to promote a situation where we VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug manufacturers. In the long run that serves the inter- est of children best if we can have multiple producers of vaccinesand not have to rely on a single one. So, Mr. Chairman, I think we are exaggerating the disagreement here this afternoon. We agree that we do not need to have thimero-sal in vaccines. If it doesn 't need to be there, we should take it out. And we should take it out as rapidly as possible. We have agreedto that. The Public Health Service, the vaccine manufacturers, andthe academies are all in agreement. We have two, in my career,historic documents which are joint statements by the AmericanAcademy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediat-rics, and the Public Health Service, which includes NIH, FDA,HRSA and CDC all signing one statement. That is not easy to ac-complish, believe me. We have all said that this material shouldcome out as soon as possible. We don 't disagree. There has been substantial progress made in just the last 12 months for hepatitis B. As Dr. Egan has said, there are two vac-cines that are free. There is no more hepatitis B with thimerosalfor pediatric use. Children can have an entire supply free of thi-merosal. For HIB, there are four vaccines. Three always were free,and now the fourth one is going to be free this month. So now wecan say the entire supply of HIB vaccine is going to be thimerosalfree. That leaves DTaP. There are four companies, one of which has already achieved thimerosal-free status. Three others are workingon it. Two of them have told us publicly that they will have thesupplements into Dr. Egan this summer, and we have gone on therecord publicly stating this. We discussed this, during this lastmonth. We put in writing that we anticipate that we are going toget there by early 2001. Some argued don 't put the date in there. That will force us to be accountable in a way that we may regret,but people agree to do that because they agreed that it is a prior-ity, and they saw the light at the end of the tunnel, and they wereconfident about it. In summary, No. 1, we agree with you that thimersol should come out. No. 2, it is coming out rapidly. And the third point is wehave to do it in a way that we feel will not jeopardize the healthof children, and we have seen their health jeopardized in the caseof hepatitis B. We don 't want to jeopardize their health this way. Some may think that is a gamble worth taking because there is not disease right now, but I can say this. When the three optionswere given at the ACIP meeting in June, the ACIP was not willingto take that gamble. The American Academy of Family Physicianswould not take that gamble. NIH would not take that gamble.HRSA would not take that gamble. CDC would not take that gam-ble, and FDA would not. They all signed the joint statement. Mr. B URTON . You have made your point. Mrs. Chenoweth, would you yield to me for just a minute?Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . The point is today you have a supply of vaccine that could be used to vaccinate every child in America that doesnot contain mercury. Now, the 8,000 children that are going to be vaccinated today, to- morrow and the next day are going to have mercury in the vaccine. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 Aug you are wrong, if you are wrong, those kids could become autistic as a result of that. Like my grandson, they could becomeautistic and be ruined for life. And no matter how much hyperboleyou use, if you have a safe supply of vaccine over here, why areyou using the other? You said we only want to have one supplier. Well, you know, get the others up to speed as quickly as possible. You have a supplynow. You have people supplying it now, and this hypothesis begsthe question if you don 't have a supply, then you still have a sup- ply of the mercury-oriented vaccine as a backup if you have to useit, but why not use the safe stuff right now? Mrs. Chenoweth.Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, I still go back to the fact \u2014I still want to talk about the duck test. Mr. Egan, I will address this to you. You know, itwas shown in the last panel that autistic symptoms emerge aftervaccination. It was shown that vaccines contain toxic doses of mer-cury. It was shown that autism and mercury poisoning, the physio-logical comparison is striking. There is altered neurotransmitteractivity, abnormal brain neuronal organization, immune systemdisturbance, EEG abnormalities. It goes on and on and on, thecomparisons. That is why I say, I back up what the chairman andthe ranking member are all asking you, that we cannot wait until2001 to have this pulled off. You know, if a jury were to look at this, the circumstantial evi- dence would be overwhelming. Let 's do something before we see it in the courts. Mr. Egan, you stated it is very important to remember that safe- ty margins are incorporated in all acceptable mercury exposurelimits, right? Could you tell me what those exposure limits are fora 1-month-old, a 3-month-old, a 6-month-old, a 9-month-old and a1-year-old? Mr. E GAN. Various government agencies have arrived at different guidelines for mercury exposure. Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. I am asking you, representing your agency, Doctor. Can you tell me based on your testimony whatthose exposure limits are that you referred to for a 1-month, 3-month, 9-month, 6-month and 1-year-old? Mr. E GAN. Well, last summer when this was discussed within the Public Health Service, all of the agencies of the Public Health Serv-ice concurred on the ATSDR recommendation, guidelines, which is0.3 micrograms of mercury per kilogram body weight per day. Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. Well, would you provide that in detail to the committee in a report? Mr. E GAN. Yes, I will, ma'am. Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. How were those exposure limits arrived at? Could you also provide that in the report? I 'd also like to know what the demographics of the population was that were tested. Andcould you forward that data to support your claim that you madein your testimony? Mr. E GAN. Yes, ma'am. Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. OK. And all the background data. What studies, Dr. Egan, were submitted to the FDA to prove that thimer-osal was safe? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 When thimerosal was, you know, was first used in vaccines in the \u2014I guess starting around the 1930 's when vaccines were not regulated by FDA but by other organiza- tions, there were some toxicology studies, you know, acute toxi-cology studies in animals and very, very limited amount of data inpeople that there was no acute toxic effect. Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. And these were studies that were done in 1930, that were submitted to \u2014\u2014 Mr. E GAN. They were also done in, I guess, the late 1920 's and reported by researchers at Eli Lilly in 1930. Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. OK. With regards to the induction of HIB vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine, could you advise the commit-tee on what studies were done with regards to these new vaccinesthat would prove that thimerosal was safe? These were done, intro-duced, in the eighties and nineties. Mr. E GAN. I believe it was in 1990. There was a long history of the use, safe use of thimerosal, you know, in vaccines since theywere\u2014since it was first introduced. And at that time, there was nodata to suggest that the added mercury from the introduction ofthose new vaccines would be harmful. Mr. B URTON . The gentlelady 's time has expired. I 'm sorry. Mr. Waxman. Mrs. C HENOWETH -HAGE. I do have other questions that I would like to submit in writing. Mr. B URTON . Yes. We'll give you some questions we 'd like for you to answer if you wouldn 't mind after the hearing is over. Mr. E GAN. Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Waxman. Mr. W AXMAN . As I understand your testimony, you 're not sure there's a problem from thimerosal, but you 're taking the prudent course of getting it out of the vaccines. Dr. Bernier, as I understandyour statement before in answer to the question why we 're not tak- ing it out of all vaccines immediately, you worry about the supplyof vaccines that will be available, although the chairman made thestatement that we have enough supply now to immunize everychild in the country with vaccines without the thimerosal. Is thatan accurate statement? Dr. B ERNIER . I would have to refer that to the manufacturer. We have been told publicly that yes, they do have an adequate supplyof vaccine, but we 're concerned\u2014I wouldn't want to\u2014I guess my first answer was perhaps a little too long; I didn 't get to the second part. We have concerns about the supply. But the second thing iswe have concerns about the harm that might come from an overlyabrupt change. To answer the question it 's a harm we believe is more real than the harm that we think would be associated withthimerosal. Mr. W AXMAN . What is that harm? Dr. B ERNIER . We know the harm from pertussis, we know the harm from hepatitis B. We know the harm from Haemophilus in-fluenza B. We can, for example, just look at USA Today. Two daysago, there was this story of a mother who made a decision not toimmunize her child against Haemophilus influenza B because itwas a new vaccine. It sounded scary to her. And when asked byher pediatrician, should I take this Haemophilus B influenza vac- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 want this Haemophilus B vaccine for your child, the mother made a decision ''no.'' The child is now deaf, the child has mental difficulties that requires Ritalin every day, and obviouslythis mother has deep regret about that. We believe \u2014\u2014 Mr. W AXMAN . I'm going to have to interrupt you because it sounds like you've answered the question and you 're going on, but I only have a limited time. That would take up all my time. Dr. B ERNIER . I understand. I have that tendency. Mr. W AXMAN . I understand. I have the same tendency. But just so I can frame the issue: Nobody wants to have thimerosal, becauseit has mercury, in the vaccines, whether we think it does harm orwhether we're sure it does harm or whether we just think maybeit does and let's be safe about it, so we ought to get it out of thevaccines as quickly as possible. But what I hear you saying is thatif we move too precipitously, we might not have a full supply of allthe immunizations available of all these illnesses that we know canbe prevented, and we know we 're going to get all these diseases back and we don 't know, if we have the use of the vaccines that still have thimerosal in them, that there 's ever going to be any harm for sure about the mercury. Is that your position? Dr. B ERNIER . That's right. We would be trading a harm that we know for one we don 't know. We know the harm will come if chil- dren are not immunized, and we know that it happened just in thelast 12 months. So we 're facing a harm we know versus a theoreti- cal harm\u2014which at this time is still only theoretical from the bestevidence that we have. Mr. W AXMAN . I think that's a good on-point statement, answer to my question. I think all of us would like to have this thimerosalout as quickly as possible. But on the other hand, I must agreewith you. I don't want the supply upset, because I believe in immu-nizations, and I worry that people are going to be frightened be-cause of the theory that has not yet been established of a connec-tion to autism, that they might not get their kids vaccinated. Weknow for sure when that happens, we 're going to get a whole long list of terrible diseases that I can feel as passionate about as any-body else. But the chairman showed a graph that showed an increase in au- tism. The chart showed a steep rise in the number of cases of au-tism. Ms. Bristol-Power, the chairman says there 's a dramatic in- crease in autism, but some experts have told us that this could bedue to better detection. I wonder if you have a view about that andif there really is an epidemic, a sudden increase, because Dr. Eganseemed to agree there was an epidemic, but you 're the expert on whether there was. Mr. E GAN. I'm sorry, but what I meant was apparently there 's a very large number of cases. Mr. W AXMAN . Being detected. So my question, Dr. Bristol-Power: Are there more cases being detected because there 's a dramatic increase in cases or better de- tection mechanism? Ms. B RISTOL -POWER . We don't have the information to answer that question. We know that part of the increase is better diag-nosis, more public awareness, and better services, frankly, so morechildren are being presented at service locations. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 United States right at the moment, we don 't have ade- quate studies that would let us know about whether there is an in- crease in prevalence. We do know worldwide epidemiological stud-ies show that\u2014any studies done since 1987 \u2014there's about a double the rate of previous results from previous studies. But again it 's not clear how much of that increase is from better diagnosis andgreater public awareness, where these children have been diag-nosed in other categories before. Mr. W AXMAN . Do you agree with that position, or do you agree with that position of Dr. Bristol-Power? Mr. E GAN. Dr. Bristol-Power is the expert on autism, not I. Mr. W AXMAN . So you would have no disagreement with her. Mr. E GAN. I would have absolutely no reason to disagree with her. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . I think we're reaching the end of the hearing. I do have a couple final questions I 'd like to ask here. How long will children continue to receive mercury vaccines if there 's not a recall? How many years will they continue to receive those? You know, you mentioned the DTaP vaccination, but you have not mentioned the DPT vaccination which is still in use, whichdoes use thimerosal. And the DPT shot, there 's a lot of concern about that vaccination. That 's why they went to the DTaP shot. Yet the FDA has not recalled the DTP vaccination and it 's still being used. So how long will mercury vaccines containing mercury beused if there's no recall? Mr. E GAN. For the routine immunization schedule that 's rec- ommended by ACIP and AIP, the recommendation is for DTaP. Mr. B URTON . I know, but they still use the DTP shot. We had people from CDC and Health and Human Services testify that theystill are using it. It 's still being used. Mr. E GAN. Again I'll have to get back to you on some of that. There have been some lots of DTP, primarily I believe Tetramunewhich is the DTP-HIB combination vaccine, but I believe that thefew lots of that that have been released are for sale overseas. Mr. B URTON . Well, in any event \u2014\u2014 Mr. E GAN. It's not being used the United States. Mr. B URTON . You're saying you don 't believe there's use in this country? Mr. E GAN. I'll have to check on it. Mr. B URTON . But in any event, the question I 'm asking is mer- cury containing vaccines, how long will they be in use if there 's not a recall? Mr. E GAN. Well, the majority of the vaccines, the Haemophilus vaccine and the hepatitis B vaccines are already thimerosal free.This has been accomplished since last summer. Mr. B URTON . My question is\u2014those vaccines that contain mer- cury, even though you 're phasing it out. How long will they be used if you do not recall them? Mr. E GAN. The\u2014in their public statement, Pasteur and Wyeth, who are the other major manufacturers, two other major manufac-turers of DTaP, said that they will be submitting supplements totheir license for thimerosal-reduced vaccines either the end of Julyor the beginning of August. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:58 But the existing supply will be used until it runs out, and you don 't know how long that would be? Mr. E GAN. No. Perhaps my colleague from CDC can, you know, comment on the \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I'd just like to know, because even though you 're transferring over to vaccines containing no mercury, if there 's a supply out there, if it 's not recalled they 're going to continue to be given to children. And that 's a concern. Yes, sir. Dr. B ERNIER . May I try to answer that question? I don 't think I can be definitive about it, because you 're right that there is a pipeline, there is a supply, and it doesn 't disappear overnight. But I think the handwriting is on the wall for vaccines that contain thi- merosal in the United States, Mr. Chairman, I think we all agreewith that. And as soon as the supply is considered adequate andsecure, I believe you will find committees and others beginning torecommend many preferences for these vaccines. How quickly willall of this take place? The recommendation \u2014it will depend on how the recommendation is stated. If you 'll go back to the July 1999 statement of\u2014joint statement\u2014it said that this goal was to be achieved as rapidly as possible. And we 're now publicly on record as predicting that it will occur early next year. But \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . OK. This is my last question, and if Mr. Waxman has any questions he can ask them as well. The FDA seems to besaying that vaccines that were licensed from 1970 to the year 2000were not required to do testing on thimerosal. Is that correct? Noneof those\u2014I mean, because thimerosal was used from the 1930 's on, they really haven 't done any testing since the seventies on whether or not there's a side effect from that; is that correct? Mr. E GAN. I'm not sure if any \u2014what test was or wasn 't done on those specific vaccines, but I will get back to the committee on that. Mr. B URTON . We'd like to know if there was any testing done on thimerosal. So anything you can give us on that we would appre-ciate. Henry, do you have any last questions? If not, I want to thank you very much for being here. We 'll submit some more questions to you for the record. We appreciate you being here. We hope that you 'll carry back to the agencies which you represent, the concerns of these parentsthat were here today regarding vaccines. We 're for vaccinations, Henry and I agree on that, but we want to make sure they 're com- pletely tested and they 're safe. Thanks a lot. [Whereupon, at 5 p.m., the committee was adjourned.][Additional information submitted for the hearing record follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 "}
