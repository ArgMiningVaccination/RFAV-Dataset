Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 1 Section 1 Responsibilities 1.1 Department Chair Department Chair bears overall responsibility for implementatio n and maintenance of safe practices and procedures in their department. Department Chair, especially in the case of large departments, may share this responsibility with a departmental biological s afety committee and/ or a unit director. 1.2 Principal Investigator The Principal Investigator (PI) has the responsibility, authori ty and support for assessing risks, establi shing policies and procedures, training personn el and maintaining the facility and equipment. The Principal Investigator performs appropriate risk assessment of research projects. The level of detail should be dependent on the hazard associated with the organism under stud y (e.g., an assessment of risk associated with research on BSL2 agents might reasonably be less detailed than a risk assessment of BS L3 or unknown agents). Each evaluation should be completed before work is undertaken a nd the project should be reassessed periodically as new data are obtained. The assessment should include an ana lysis of the risks posed by the organism under investigation and by any specific research methods that may aff ect that risk (e.g., procedures requiring highly concentrated amounts of virus or inoculation of laboratory anim als). No human or animal pathogen should be studied without prior written approval of the Biological Safety Committee. The procedures for handling unclassified agents should be addr essed by the Biological Safet y Committee, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS), and the related departments. The agents must be registered and infor mation about these agents must be provided to the Office of Environmental Health and Safe ty (EHS). Principal Investigators are responsible for the application of appropriate safety practices and procedures within their laboratories and instructin g students and staff of potent ial hazards. The Principal Investigator also approves research personnel to work in the laboratory and assures that personnel are competent to conduct the work. Review and document once a year BSL3 responsibilities with research personnel. The review shoul d include the following: Review signs and labels. Methods for recognizing task s that may involve exposure. Review the use and lim itations of engineering controls (e.g. re view centrifugation protocols). Discuss autoclave function and proper procedure for the autocla ving of waste. Demonstrate work within a biological safety cabinet (BSC) with props to show safe work practices and how contaminated items are to be discarded. Review the use and lim itations of safe wor k practices which all users of the facility are expected to follow. Review the use and limitations of PPE including types, location , removal, handling, decontamination and disposal. If applicab le, include the use o f purified air power respirator (PAPR) or disposal N95 respirators. Review and discuss spill procedures. Review exposure incident procedures. Walk-through of the facility showing the sign in/out procedure, donning and removing PPE, and location of all alarms as well as their meanings. Opportunity for questions.

EHS provides information on regulations that apply to the laboratory. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 3 EHS will perform BSL3 and all other applicable lab safety train ing for new personnel. EHS will advise on safe methods for new procedures and will pro vide assistance in the event of a biohazardous material spill. EHS will inspect BSL3 labs semi-annually to ensure continued co mpliance with applicable safety regulations. The Biological Safety Officer (B SO) is responsible for the impl ementation of policy guide lines recommended by the Institutional Biological Safety Committee (IBC). The BSO i dentifies potential probl em areas and suggests to the IBC safety objectives to be achieved. In addition, the BSO is also the Institutional Biological Safety Officer for recombinant DNA research. S ome of the specific biological safety services provide d by the EHS include: Evaluation and inspection of laboratory facilities for work wit h infectious agents. Investigation of laboratory accid ents and if needed, develop an d communicate written preventive measures. Consultation to members of the Yale community in matters relate d to biological safety. Periodically survey Yale University's research labs to identify potential work with biohazards. Dissemination of information pert aining to safety in biological research through a per iodic newsletter, lab inspections, demonstration or sp ecial training course as may be necessary. 1.5 Biological Safety Committee The Biological Safety Committee serves as the Yale Institutiona l Biosafety Committee (IBC) in compliance with the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthe tic Nucleic Acids (NIH Guidelines). The committee's BSL3 responsibilities include: Registration of laborat ories working with BSL3 agents (see sect ion 13.6 for a list of agents.). Registers laboratories and appr oves containment measures and pr ocedures to be used. Advises facility users on polic ies related to BSL3 containment. In conjunction with EHS, develop BSL3 emergency response proced ures. Periodically update labor atory registrations. In conjunction with Employee Heal th, determine the necessity fo r special medical monitoring. Advises Yale administration on the suspension of access privile ges for staff found to be in violation of policies and procedures governing facility use. It is the responsibility of the Biological Safety Committee to recommend to the President and Provost pertinent safety guidelines relating to pro cedures and faci lities used in biological research. Section 2 Medical Surveillance Program 2.1 Medical Surveillance A medical surveillance program of University personnel engaged in biological research is conducted by Employee Health at the Yale Health Center located at 55 Lock Street. Th e purpose of the program is to conduct periodic health assessments of employees with attention devoted to facto rs or conditions associated with a particular biological agent a given individual might handle. For a partic ular employee, the medical surveillance program might well call for any of a number of precautionary measures, including immunizations, a periodic physical examination, and collec tion of a serum sample. The purpose of the medical surveillance program is to: ensure individual employees are physically fit for the nature a nd extent of the work to be undertaken. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 4 recommend appropriate medical precautions. perform periodic reassessment of employees to determine if medi cal conditions associated with employment are prevalent and, if so, to unde rtake definitive measures to a lleviate them. The extent of medical surveillance for a given employee will va ry greatly and be dependent upon: nature of the research project in which involved biological agents to which dir ectly or potentially exposed factors relating to the current or previous health status of th e individual. The Principal Investigator is to provide Employee Health with g uidelines and descriptions of conditions that may have significance for personnel assigned to the laboratory. It is the ultimate responsibility of the Principal Investigator or lab supervisor to inform Employee Health about employees new or currently working in BSL2 or BSL3 areas. The survey frequency of an employee working with B SL2 or BSL3 agents is determined by the type of research performed and the rec ommendation of the employee's supervisor or Principal Investigator. Medical surveillance is provided without charge for any employe e of Yale University working in biological research laboratories. For more information about this program contact the Employee Health at (432-0071). All BSL-3 Researchers must enroll in the Yale Employee Health m edical surveillance program. To initiate your registration, call Employee Hea lth at 432-7978 to schedule an a ppointment with the Employee Health Physician. Bring to Employee Health the \"Yale University Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) Worker Medical Clearance Form\". Complete the top portion of the form and have your Principal Inv estigator sign off on the form before you meet with Employee Health. Medical surveillance meeting with Employ ee Health is required prior to entering the BSL3 laboratory. 2.2 Employee Serum Storage Many infections do not result in an overt disease condition. S uch infections are detected by development of antibodies to the agent in questi on. Therefore, Employee Healt h has established a program for persons engaged in certain types of biological rese arch. This includes collection of pre-assignment serum as well as routine periodic specimens. If an illness occurs, which may be related to the a gent the person is working with, additional serum samples will be collected. 2.2.1 Enrolling in the Yale Serum Storage Program Researchers engaged in BSL3 research must enroll in the Yale Se rum Storage Program. Before you can initiate BSL-3 research, you must provide a baseline serum sample which will either be banked by Employee Health or tested for antibodies to your r esearch pathogen with your conse nt. The banked sample is a private confidential specimen that can't be tested wi thout your consent. It provide s a baseline sample that can be evaluated in the event of an exposure incident with Ris k Group agents (or agents that require BSL3 work pract ices or containment). Employee Health Office (432-7978) will coordinate your private meeting with the Employee Health Physician or representative and they will arrange for your baseline serum sa mple at the laboratory. The Employee Health Office is located on the 2nd floor of the Yale Health Center at 55 Locke Street, New Haven, CT. The lab is located on the lower level of the Yale Health C enter at the same address. Mu st complete the medical surveillance meeting with Employee Health and provide a ba seline serum sample (or test) b efore entering the BSL3 laboratory. After your visit with Employee Health, they will arrange for your baseline serum sample at the blood drawing laboratory for serum storage. Yale Employee Health Office located at Yale Health Center, 55 L ock Street, 2nd floor. 2.3 Immunizations In certain situations personnel engaged in particular research activities will be immunized with appropriate vaccines, such as rabies, rubella and measles. Vaccines not co mmonly available will be obtained, whenever possible, for thos e engaged in specific research with potential exposure to the agent in question. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 5 When indicated, appropriate follow-up serum samples will be col lected at periodic intervals to measure vaccine- induced antibody production. 2.3.1 Yellow Fever Vaccine Recommended for all persons actively working with or entering a reas where yellow fever virus is used. 2.3.2 Rabies Vaccine Recommended for all persons entering laboratories or animal fac ilities with rabies vaccination entrance requirements. 2.3.3 Venezuelan Equine En cephalitis Vaccine Recommended for all persons entering laboratories or animal fac ilities with VEE vaccination entrance requirements. Custodial and maintenance personnel shall not en ter the designated areas until at least one day following the termination of experiments with the virus. 2.3.4 Rift Valley Fever Vaccine Recommended for selected persons traveling to Africa or plannin g to work with Rift Valley Fever at Plum Island, CDC, USAMRIID. 2.3.5 Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine Recommended for persons actively working with Japanese Encephal itis virus. 2.3.6 Eastern and Western Equin e Encephalitis Vaccines Recommended for persons actively working with either or both vi ruses. 2.3.7 Hepatitis B Vaccine Recommended for persons working with human blood, body fluids o r tissues. 2.3.8 Vaccinia Vaccine Employees are required to receive a medical evaluation and coun seling regarding vaccinia immunization from Employee Health before beginning work with vaccinia. In cases where infected animals are not housed in filter- top cages or other primary cont ainment devices vaccination shal l be required for room entry. 2.4 Medical Restrictions 2.4.1 Pregnancy It is recognized that exposure to certain infectious agents may adversely affect a fetus during pregnancy if the mother is infected with the agent. Therefore, if pregnancy is possible while you are workin g in an infectious disease laboratory or laboratory engaged in work with infectious agents you should consult your principle investigator or supervisor. The Employee Health is also available for question s regarding the potential harm from the biological agents present within your laboratory. Women that are pregnant or become pregnant are encouraged to in form their supervisors or principal investigators and Employee Health. Employees a re urged to discuss exposure i ssues with their supervisors or principal investigators regarding associat ed risks of research being cond ucted and pregnancy. Employee Health will give advice about precautions that may be necessary. Employee Health is a resource for pregnant women to discuss que stions or concerns they may have about risks in their work environment. Employee Health may also act as a liai son between pregnant employees and their respective supervisors or principal investigators. 2.4.2 Other Restrictions Restrictions or recommendation s will be made on an individual b asis after discussion with the Employee Health Physician and the employee's personal physician. Examples of c onditions that may warrant special precautions Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 6 are HIV infection, immunosuppressi ve conditions or drug therapy that suppresses the immune system. Therefore, if you have any of the above conditions, you must inform your p hysician and Employee Health about the situation. 2.5 Emergency Procedures for Exposure Incidents An \"exposure incident\" is specific contact (eye, mouth, other m ucous membrane, non-intact skin, percutaneous or aerosol exposure) to potentially infectious materials that resu lts from the performance o f an employee's duties. An employee who sustains a known or potential \"exposure inciden t\" must wash the area immediately with soap and water or immediately leave the laboratory in the event of a n aerosol exposure. The e mployee must report the incident to his/her supervis or and the Biosafety Office. The supervisor must complete an Employee First Report of Injury form and a Health Service Report form, documenting the route of exposure and the circumstances under w hich the incident occurred. Both forms are available at http://www.yale.edu/hronline/workers-comp/. Employees must go to Employee H ealth within 1 to 2 hours follow ing the exposure incident to consult with the Employee Health Physic ian. Call Employee Health at 432-0071. Em ployee Health hours are Monday to Friday 8:30am to 5:00pm. After hours go to Acute Care. 2.5.1 Percutaneous Injury Response Treat affected area: Wash well with disinfectant or antiseptic soap and water for 15 minutes. 2.5.2 Splash to Face Response Flush affected area in eye wash for 15 minutes. If an eyewash is not immediately available, use another source of clean portable water a nd follow up with a full 15min ute eyewash as soon as feasible. NOTE: If the accident generates an aerosol (i.e. spill outside the biosafety cabinet) leave the area promptly and follow the response procedures a t a safer location. Identify a backup location prior to initiation of work. 2.5.3 Aerosol Exposure Response Hold breath and immediately leave the room. Quickly remove out er gloves before leaving and drop gloves on floor before entering the ante room. Remove PPE carefully: turn expos ed areas inward and place in a biohazard bag. Wash hands well with soap and wa ter. Also, wash any exposed sk in with disinfectant wipes or soap and water. Remove contaminated personal cl othing and place in a separate b iohazard bag. Post biohazard spill sign and rec ord time of spill on sign. Lab should be evacuated for at least 30 minutes. PI and EHS must clear lab for reentry. All BSL3 labs, especially those without a sink in the ante room , should have an emergency clothing kit that contains the following: two sets of scrub s (pants with tops in relevant sizes), a box of disinfectan t hand wipes, two portable eyewash bottles, two biohazard bags, and booties or two pairs o f shoes. 2.6 Post-Exposure Evaluation and Follow-Up Employee Health will provide the post-exposure evaluation and f ollow-up at no cost to employees following an \"exposure incidents\". The post-exposure monitoring periods are dependent on the type of exposure; which is related to the various incubation periods of the infectious age nts. Employees can obtain copies of th eir medical records by contact ing University Health Services. These records are kept by the Health Information Services, 55 Lock Street, 432-00 62. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 7 All employees who have an \"exposu re incident\" will be offered a confidential post-exposure medical evaluation and follow-up through the Employ ee Health. The post-exposure m edical evaluation and follow-up includes the following: A review/evaluation of the rout e of exposure and the circumstan ces under which the incident occurred. For human blood and body fluid exposure: An attempt to identify the source individual, if possible, and his/her HIV and HBV infection status. The employee will be offered the option of having blood drawn f or baseline serum collection (storage) or for HIV and HBV serological status t esting depending on the inciden t. The employee will be offered pos t exposure prophylaxis when med ically indicated. The employee will be given appro priate treatment and counseling concerning precautions to take during the period after the exposure incident. The employee will also be given information on what potential illnesses to be alert for and to report any unusual sign s or symptoms to app ropriate personnel. OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Regula tion requires, for blood and bo dy fluid exposure, the University to provide the employee with a copy of the evaluating health care professional's written opinion within 15 working days of the completion of the original evaluation. The health care professional' s written opinion will indicate: (1) that the employee has been informed of the result s of the evaluation; and (2) that the employee has been told about any medical conditions resulting from expos ure to blood or other potentially infectious materials requiring further evaluation or treatment. All other findings or diagnoses will remain confidential and wi ll be recorded in the employee's medical record. All laboratory tests ar e conducted at no co st to the employee. Contact Employee Health at (2 03)432-0071 if you require post-ex posure evaluation or have follow-up questions. Section 3 Laboratory Procedures 3.1 Entry Procedures Entry into the facility is restricted to authorized individuals . Only individuals required for program or support needs are authorized to enter the facility while research is in progress. They must be advised of the potential biohazards and informed of laboratory procedures. The Principal Investigator, lab supervisor, or an authorized BS L3 person must accompany maintenance and repair personnel. Visitors are not permitted in the BSL3 facility wit hout prior consent from the PI. All visitors must complete and sign the Biosafety Level 3 Visitor Clearance Form (see section 12.3) prior t o and followi ng entry of the BSL3 facility. Visitors must be accompanied by an authoriz ed BSL3 researcher or EHS representative for the duration of their visit to the facility. Before entering the anteroom to the laboratory, check the readi ng of the magnehelic pressure gauge. If your facility is equipped with a digit al room pressure monitor that has both an audible and vi sual alarm, verify that the \"green\" enter light is on. There will not be an audible al arm during \"green\" or \"clean to enter\" conditions. Laboratory personnel must verify t hat the direction of the airf low is going into the BSL3 laboratory. If the BSL3 laboratory is positive to t he corridor do not enter the la boratory and notify the PI, EHS and Yale BS&O (203-432-6888). Read and follow all entry procedures. Biohaza rd door signs and entry requirements and procedures must be posted. Upon entering the anteroom, sign the BSL3 Entry/Exit Log. Befo re walking into the laboratory, put on a clean gown and then proceed into the laboratory. Once in the laborat ory, don gloves (2 pairs), face shield or respiratory protection (if applic able) and any other required p ersonal protective equipment (PPE) for your project. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 8 3.2 Exit Procedures Before leaving the laboratory, remove outer gloves, gown, inner gloves and face protection and wash hands. Verify the airflow direction be fore entering the anteroom. Enter the anteroom and mak e sure door is closed. Sign the BSL3 Entry/Exit Log, e xit anteroom, check all doors ar e closed and locked. 3.3 Personnel Practices Personnel practices or work practice controls reduce the likeli hood of employee exposure to infectious agents by altering the way a task is performed. The protection provided by work practice controls is based upon employee behavior and attitude. Proper work practice controls pro tect others from exposure to i nfectious agents in the wo rk area or facility, reduce possible cross contamination and improve the quality of the wor k performed. Routine use of safe work practices also provides a marg in of safety for unrecognized hazards. Remember that safety is a shared responsibility. Your attitude and work practices are cri tical for your own health and safety, and for the we lfare of those around you. Organize and plan work procedures with safety in mind and keep an uncluttered work space. Always make sure all necessary safety materials and exposure control equipment a re available and in good working order. Keep tuberculocidal disinfectant or 10% household chlorine bleach an d paper towels nearby in case of a spill. Always remove personal protective equipment (such as gowns, glo ves, boot covers) and wash hands when leaving the facility. Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Beards or mustaches may be undes irable in work places with pote ntial airborne contamination. Facial hair retains particulate contamination more persistently than clean shaven s kin. Clean shaven faces enhance the fit of facial masks and are required when face fitting respirators are used. Keep long hair tied back or covered. Eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics and lip balm, and handling contact lenses are prohibited in the laboratory. Mouth pipetting is not permitted . Mechanical pipetting devices must be used. 3.4 General Laboratory Procedures A significant concern in the BSL3 facility is the exposure to i nfectious aerosols. Various laboratory activities lead to the production of aerosols. The production of aerosols may result from pouring liquid cultures or supernatants, mixing a liquid cultur e using high speed dev ices such as a vort ex, dropping a tube or flask o f liquid culture, or the breaking of a tube during centrifugation. Any procedure that i mparts energy to a cultured microorganism has the potential to generate aerosols. It is important to minimize or avoid production of aerosols and conduct all aerosol generating procedures in a biological safety cabinet. Confine aerosols as close as possible to their point of generation. Keep doors locked when the laboratory is unoccupied. Post the biohazard door sign on the access door to the facility . Ensure that any specific entry requirements (PPE and vaccination), the name o f the agent (for compliance wi th federal and Yale University Regulations, the name of the pathogen family may be substituted for pathogen name as a security initiative), the Biosafety Level, and the name of an emergency contact person is posted on either the sign or the Laboratory Information Card. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 9 Label all equipment (e.g., incub ators, freezers) used to store or ship infectious materials with biohazard warning labels and agent(s) name. Place the BSL3 wall notice (not a door sign) inside your labora tory to remind researchers of the core safety practices. Infectious materials may be transported to and from the BSL3 fa cility in sealed leakproof containment carriers inside labeled secondary containers, provided the transport is to another BSL3 facility. Opening containers of infectious materials or handling infectio us materials must be done only in biological safety cabinets. All items must be decontaminated before leaving the BSL3 facili ty. Decontaminate all contaminated laboratory wastes and equipment before disposal or washing. Store contaminated materials that can be autoclaved in closed, leak-p roof containers containing suitable disinfectant solution. Allow an appropriate l ength of contact time before r emoval from the laboratory. Decontaminate work surfaces when experiments conclude or after any spill. Always wear gloves when handling potentially infectious materia ls or surfaces. A fresh solution of 10% chlorin e bleach should be made weekly a nd be available for decontamination. Avoid the use of needles and other sharps whenever possible. N eedles shall never be recapped, removed, sheared, bent or broken. Needles and syringes must be discarde d promptly in a needle sharps container after use. For BSL3 experiments, this requires placement of the shar ps containers within the biosafety cabinet. Avoid the use of glass items and use plastic alternative items. Contact EHS for assistance on alternatives to glass items (e.g., tubes, pipettes, flasks). If sharps cannot be eliminated and must be used, work with EHS to identify a safe sharp alternative for evaluation by your laboratory. Conduct all procedures carefully to minimi ze the creation of ae rosols. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 10 3.5 Vacuum Line Traps and Filter Systems HEPA filters or HEPA like filters must be installed between the collection flasks and the vacuum source. Note this system set up is required for both house vacuum systems an d portable vacuum pumps. Infectious aerosols can contaminate the house system or be dispersed within the facilit y if filters are not in place. Vacuum line chemical traps and filters prevent suction of materials into the vacuum lines. The trap system also prevents vacuum lines from clogging with material. The trap system protects your wor k from materials in the vacuum line from backing- up into your facility. In-line H EPA filters are manufactured b y Pall Trincor Corporation. The local distributor is Pond Technical Sales (203) 284- 1500. Another manufacturer is G elman Sciences. Their product is called Vacushield (HEPA like filter) and may be order ed through VWR Sc ientific or Baxter. A. Collection Flask, B. Overflow flask, C. Filter, D. Vacuum Line 3.6 BSL3 Laboratory Practices Keep laboratory doors closed, and locked when unoccupied. Post biohazard sign on lab door, include agent, entry requireme nts, and an emergency contact phone number. Verify proper air direction before each entry into BSL3 areas. Label all equipment and storing infectious organisms with a bio hazard sign. Only allow researchers authorized by EHS to perform BSL3 experi ments. All researchers must have demonstrated proficiency in BSL3 micr obiological practices. Contact Employee Health Office fo r enrollment in the BSL3 medic al surveillance pr ogram (432-0071). Develop and maintain a l ab BSL3 safety manual. Do not permit visitors until lab cleared by P.I. and EHS (785-3 550). Keep animals and plants not used in BSL3 experiments out of the laboratory. Don't eat, smoke, drink, or st ore food in BSL3 areas. Wear solid-front or wrap-around gowns, gloves that can fit over gown cuffs, and safety glasses inside but not outside the laboratory. Do not mouth pipette . Use mechanical pipetting devices. Perform all work with BSL3 agents inside a biological safety ca bi net . C oll ect al l BS L 3 wa ste i nsi de t he biological safety cabinet. Use physical containment devices, such as sealed rotors or safe ty buckets for centrifugation. Load and unload sealed centrifug e rotors and safety buckets ins ide a biological safety cabinet. Disinfectant solution Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 11 Use a biological safety cabinet t o contain aerosol-producing eq uipment. Wear respiratory protection devi ces when aerosols cannot be con tained. Protect the vacuum system from contamination by installing a HE P A or H E P A - l i k e f i l t e r i n be t w e e n t he vacuum system and th e collection flask. Avoid using hypodermic needles a nd other sharps. Use plastic s upplies in place of glass. Use 2 leak proof, labeled unbrea kable containers for the transp ort of BSL3 materials between laboratories. Consult EHS for interstate shipment requirements. Wash hands after completing expe rimental procedures and before leaving the laboratory. Disinfect work surfaces daily a nd immediately after a spill. Decontaminate all labor atory wastes and contaminated materials before disposal, washing, or reuse. For transport to the autoclave, package contaminated materials in closed, durable, leak-proof containers. Verify autoclave proce dures periodically. Post incident and spill response procedures in the laboratory. Report spills and potential exposures to the P.I. and EHS. An eyewash should be readily available Maintain a biological spill kit in a location outside the labor atory to facilitate spill response and decontamination. Report any facility or equipment problems to EHS and Physical P lant. Control insect and rodent infestation. 3.7 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Dedicate PPE for the experiment. PPE worn for BSL3 work should not be worn in other areas. Remove before leaving the laboratory. Wear a lab coat or solidfront gown, preferably with a knit or grip cuff. Double glove for all work within the biological safety cabinet (BSC). Remove the outer pair before exiting the BSC and don a new pair each time you reenter the BSC. Ensure that your gloves extend over the sleeve of your lab coat . An opening at the wrist will allow aerosols generated within the BSC to contaminate your wrist and forearm, extend handwashing to your elbow. Sleeve covers can be worn to ensure coverage of the wrist and w ill also minimize contamination of the sleeves of your lab coat. Face Protection (mask and eyewea r) can also be worn and will pr otect mucous membranes from exposure in the event a spill outside the BSC during transfer of materia l to and from the incubator. It will also help to prevent you from touching your e yes, nose and mouth when workin g within the BSC. Remove PPE before leaving the laboratory. Placing a hook withi n the anteroom will facilitate this requirement. Remove your outer gloves first, then your lab coa t or gown, followed by the inner gloves. Take your face protection off last. Don't touch your face with glov ed hands. Remove gloves and other clothing aseptically, from the inside out, and avoid touching the contam inated outer side of the glove. Decontaminate reusable PPE as soon as feasible after it has bee n contaminated. Small areas can be spot treated with a suitable disinfectant, such as 10% household ble ach. Lab coats can also be autoclaved or sent to a laundry facility equipped to handle biohazardous PPE. Dis posable PPE can be place d within a biohazard bag, treated and discarded as biomedical waste. Wash your hands with soap and water after removing PPE and befo re leaving the laboratory. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 12 Note: if a respirator is required for your research, you must c omplete a confidential medical health questionnaire for Employee Health and enroll in the Yale Respir atory Protection Program. Training is required before initial use and annually thereafter. Call 785 3550 if you have any questions. 3.8 Handwashing Wash hands whenever PP E is removed and before leaving the labor atory. Wash with soap and warm water for at least 30 seconds. Since t he contact time of most soaps is quite extensive for actual decontamination, mechanical friction from scrubbing and water dilution are essential for complete cleaning. No glove is 100% leak proof and you must change gloves often an d as soon as feasible when visibly contaminated. Never wet or wash your gloves with water or disinfectant, as th is will encourage wicking and increase permeability of the protective barrier. If you wish to wash gloves with disinfectant, check with EHS to see if your gloves can be washed. Break through times for that disinfectan t and your glove material mus t be evaluated before initiation this of procedure. 3.9 Procedures for centrifugation As secondary containment is required, all centrifugation shall be done using centrifuge safety buckets or sealed centrifuge tubes in sealed rotors. Please notify EHS if you ha ve a centrifuge that does not have adequate secondary containment for further evaluation. The following procedures for centrifugation are recommended: Examine tubes and bottles for cracks or stress marks before usi ng them. Fill and decant all centrifuge tubes and bottles within the bio logical safety cabinet. Never overfill centrifuge tubes as leakage may occur when tubes are filled to capacity. The maximum for centrifu ge tubes is 3/4 full. Wipe outside of tubes with disin fectant before placing in safet y cups or rotors. Place all sealed tubes in safety buckets or sealed rotors. Ins pect the \"O\" ring seal of the safety bucket, the inside of safety buc kets or rotors and co rrect rough walls caus ed by erosion or adheri ng of matter and remove debris from the rubber cushions. Seal rotor or bucket and wipe down with disinfectant, remove outer gloves, and transport to the centrifuge. Wait 2-5 minutes after the run to allow aerosols to settle in t he event of a spill. Transport sealed rotor or safety bucket to biological safety cabin et to complete your experiment . Don new pair of outer gloves Open safety buckets or rotors in a biological safety cabinet. Determine prior to initiating BSL3 work if the rotor does not fit in the biologi cal safety cabinet. You may n eed to use a smaller rotor or activate the sliding mechanism for the view screen of the biosafety cabinet. If the view screen is fixed and the rotor does not fit, BSL3 work may not be initiated. Contact EHS for immediate assi stance. Decontaminate the rotor or safet y bucket by spraying with an ap propriate disinfectant and allowing to air dry. Wipe the throw line within the centrifuge with disinfectant. I n the event of a spill during centrifugation, follow the spill response procedures outlined in the Biosafety Spill R esponse Guide. Avoid the use of a microfuge, which is difficult to contain. I f you cannot avoid using a microfuge, use a model that has built in secondary containment (a sealed rotor) along with microfuge tubes equipped with an O-ring seal. Please contact EHS for assistance in identifying contain ment features for purchasing new microfuge or to evaluate upgrading y our existing model. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 13 For high risk biohazard experiments, the following measure may be employed: a HEPA-filtered respirator must be worn when opening the centrifuge to remove the rotor. If construction of the centrifuge permits, the centrifuge chamber is to be connected to a vacuum pump with a H EPA filter installed between the centrifuge and the vacuum pump. A Class I biosafety cabinet may be installed over the ultra-cen trifuge as an addition al containment measure. 3.10 Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) Protocol A properly balanced and used Cla ss II Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) will do an excellent job of controlling airborne contaminants only if ap propriate contamination control procedures and aseptic techniques are also employed. Additional information on BSC policies and procedure s can be found in the Clean Air Device Program Guide. All BSCs shall be professionally certified at the time of insta llation and annually ther eafter. If a BSC is to be moved, it shall be professiona lly decontaminated before moving and recertified before work commences. Contact EHS at 737-2125 for assistance with certification, deco ntamination and other services. Keep the work area of the BSC free of unnecessary equipment or supplies. Clutter inside the BSC may affect proper airflow and the level o f protection provided. Also, avo id blocking the front or rear intake grills. Keep the front and rear grilles clear when working within the B SC. Avoid blocking the rear grille. Don't store items on top of the BSC. Remind fellow researcher s to minimize traffic and work behind the operator, as this may interfere with cabinet airf low. Depending on the location of the BSC within the room, opening and closing the room door can significantly interfere wit h BSC airflow. Some BSCs are equipped with ultraviolet (UV) lights. If good p rocedures are followed, UV lights are not needed. All UV lights shall be turned off whenever the laborat ory is occupied. Avoid using toxic, explosive, fl ammable, or radioactive substan ces in the BSC unless a safety professional has approved the procedure. Perform all work within a BSC. T his includes discarding waste within the BSC. Moving your hands in and out of the BSC will disrupt the protective air curtain at the front access opening. To begin the BSC operation, turn on the lights, confirm the air intake and exhaust grills are clear, and turn on the blower. If a drain valve is present, make certain it is cl osed. Wash hands and arms with germicidal soap before and after work in the BSC. Operators shall wear long sleeved gowns with tight fitting cuffs and surgical gloves. Th is measure protects the operator's hands and arms from contamination and minimizes the shedding of skin flora int o the work area. Disinfect interior surfaces of th e work area using freshly prep ared appropriate disinfectant. Everything needed for the complete procedure shall be placed in the cabinet before starting work. Wipe items down with disinfectant pri or to placement within the BSC. Nothing shall pass in or out through the air barrier until the procedure is completed. Avoid overloading th e work area, and thereby compromising the efficacy of the BSC. Work supplies are best arranged t o segregate clean from dirty m aterials. Segregate clean areas from contaminated areas within t he BSC by at least 12-14\". Wait five minutes after all materials have been placed in the B SC before beginning work. This will enable the BSC to purge airborne contaminants from the work area. Work as far to the back of the BSC workspace as possible. Always use mechanical pipetting aids. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 14 Avoid using open flames inside BSCs. If a flame must be presen t, use a burner with a pilot light and place it to the rear of the workspace. Flames disrupt the unidirectiona l airflow and contribute to the heat load inside the BSC. Flames have shortened the lifetime of HEPA filters, b urned holes through HEPA filters and have caused explosions in BSCs. Neve r leave an open flame (burner o r pilot light) unatte nded in your BSC. Consider using an electric micro-incinerator if a heat source i s required. Do not work in a BSC while a warning light or alarm is signalin g. Absorbent paper on the work surface of the BSC will safely abso rb splatter. Collect all waste within the BSC. Waste containers should be p laced inside the BSC to avoid breaking the air barrier and bringing contaminated items out into the room. Sma ller biohazard waste bags may be utilized along with beakers or shallow tr ays containing disinfectant for the collection and disinfecting of pipettes and other contaminated items. Waste can also be collected within t he BSC in the following manner. Horizontal collection: Horizontal trays containing disinfectant allow total immersion of pipettes. Vertical collection: Beakers containing disinfectant can be use d if disinfectant is drawn up inside the pipette and allowed to run down the interior wall upon disposal into the be aker. Bags: Bags have the potential fo r creating aerosols when moved. Seal autoclave bags with in the cabinet and place within a second bag. Carefully add water to the primary bag be fore sealing (25 ml for smaller bags, 200 ml for larger bags). The addition of wat er will help to generate stea m within the bag during the autoclave cycle. Store tissue culture flasks in the incubator within small secon dary trays to help minimize contamination. Trays will also facilitate t ransfer to and from the BSC. Keep your hands away from your face (face protection helps to m inimize the potential for this route of exposure). Avoid the use of glass Pasteur p ipettes or needles and syringes . Substitute plastic for glass whenever feasible. Alternatives to glass Pasteur pi pettes include: plastic pipette s, plastic transfer pipettes, gel pipette tips and pipette tip extenders, aspirators, and flexibl e plastic aspiration pipettes. stock rooms carry a 2ml plastic aspir ating pipette without a cotton p lug. If the use of sharps cannot be avoided, maintain a sharps conta iner in the immediate vicinity of use. Discard intact needles and syringes immediately after use. Use a one handed disposal technique method (keep a hand behind your back or by your side, don't place on or near t he opening of the sharps container). Never recap, bend, break or otherwis e manipulate sharps by hand. If you must remove the needle from the syringe, use the small opening on the top of the needle box for this pur pose. Forceps, tweezers, or small pliers may also be utilized. Protect the house vacuum system or pump from contamination by i nstalling a trap and fi lter system. Use a primary collection flask contai ning disinfectant, followed by a n overflow flask, which leads through a HEPA or hydrophobic filter. After completion of work, enclose or cover all equipment and ma terials. Wipe items down with an appropriate disinfectant prior to removal from the BSC. Allow the BSC to r un for five minutes to purge airborne contaminants from the work area. Decontaminate interior surfaces (work surface, grilles, sides, back and inside front view screen) with an appropriate disinfectant after r emoval of all materials, cultur es and apparatus. If using 10% bleach solution on work surfaces, allow it to air dry then follow up with 70% ethanol wipe to prevent rusting of stainless steel surface. Periodically decontaminate under work grills and work surfaces if these parts are removable. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 15 Decontaminate liquid waste with household bleach diluted 10% ag ainst the volume of the waste. Allow at least a 30minute contact time for full decontamination. Transport waste to autoclave in a leakproof container. 3.11 Chemical Hood - Guidelines for Operation Use a chemical hood for containment of hazardous chemicals whic h are not appropriate for use in a biosafety cabinet. It is important to keep the sash open within its prop er operation position. Verify that the chemical hood is exhausting. Work with the sash lowered to the 100\u00b110 ft/min level. The sas h must be below chin level. Work at least 6 inches inside the hood. Do not block the face of the hood (e.g., with shielding or larg e pieces of equipment). Do not block rear exhaust slot. Place bulky items to the rear a nd sides on a supporting mesh elevated at least two inches from the work surfaces to allow passage of air to th e rear slot. 3.12 Waste Handling and Disposal Procedures All waste from a BSL3 facility must be considered infectious an d should be decontaminated daily. Additional information on the disposal of m edical waste is found on the EH S website at http://ehs.yale.edu/ Waste from BSL3 facilities are generally autoclaved in the lab, and then packed as \"Anatomical/Pathological waste\" to ensure it is incinerated as a final method of disposa l. Liquids are inactivated by autoclaving or by inactivating with household bleach. Final concentration of 10% bleach against the volume of waste to be inactivated. A minimum conta ct time of 30 minutes is required. The liquid is then disposed of down the sink us ing large amounts of water fol lowed by a disinfectant. Solid wastes are inactivated by autoclaving. Autoclaves are op erated at 250 F and 15 pounds per square inch pressure for 60 minutes. The biohazard autoclave bags should n ot be taped closed. After autoclaving, all waste leaving the facility must be doubled bagged before placing in a box-bag unit. 3.13 Equipment Repairs/Service Potentially contaminated and contaminated equipment sent out fo r repair/service or to be discarded must be decontaminated as thoroughly as possible. Notify EHS if all co ntaminated portions of the equipment could not be sufficiently decontaminated. Not e: insufficiently decontaminate d equipment cannot be discarded. Contact EHS to identify an adequate dec ontamination procedure. Affix a Biosafety Notice equipment tag to the equipment indicat ing when the equipment was decontaminated, what disinfectant was used, and the name of the person who perf ormed the decontamination. Tags are available through the Office of Environmental Health and Safety at 785-3550. Sample of the equipment decontamination tag is in section 10.6. Thorough decontamination of highl y technical or sensitive equip ment or equipment with limited access to contaminated areas may not be possible. Decontaminate the equi pment to the degree possible (flushing lines or wiping down the exterior) and affix a label to the equipment before sending it out for repair. The label must indicate what portions of the equi pment remain contaminated and include the biohazard symbol as well as the term \"biohazard\". The label must convey this information to al l affected workers (service representatives, manufacturer, etc.). Notify EHS who will work with the repair or service technician to develop an appropriate decontamination procedure and identify required PPE for working on the equipment. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 16 3.13.1 Service or repairs of the Biolog ical Safety Cabinets (BSC) and the exhaust system's HEPA filters and pre-filters. EHS will approve a certified vendor for certifying and repairin g BSC and servicing the exhaust system's HEPA filters appr oved certifier will perform f ormaldehyde decontamination on the exhaust system for changing filters. The certifier will be accompanied by a r epresentative from EHS whenever entering the facility. See Section 7.0 for additional information on maintenance and v isitor procedures. 3.14 Procedure for Laundering Lab oratory Protective Clothing Disposable protective clothing, which is placed in biomedical w aste after use, is preferred. Reusable laboratory protective clothing must be deco ntaminated by autoclaving befor e disposal or laundering. 3.15 Transport of Human Pathogens or Other Potentially Infectious Ma terials on Campus (between labs or buildings) Package the material within the BSC. Use two leakproof contain ers: sealed primary container sealed secondary container absorbent (paper towels) between the primary and secondary cont ainers suitable for volume transported a biohazard sticker on outside of the secondary container with agent name, lab address and phone number Utilize plastic containers when ever feasible, avoid glass. Sealed plastic (not glass) primar y vials can be transported wit hin sealed-labeled plastic bags. Place glass primary containers within a sealed rigid plastic co ntainer with absorbent and padding to cushion the vial during transport. Wipe the exterior of both primar y and secondary containers with disinfectant prior to transport. Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, and face prote ction) is not required for transporting human pathogens or other potentially i nfectious materials if properly packaged and decontamination has been performed. Do not wear gloves in hallways (don't touch elevator buttons, d oorknobs, telephones, or other clean items or surfaces with gloved hands). Remember: PPE should be removed before exiting the laboratory. Placing a hook in your lab may facilitate compliance with this requirement. Handle your packages carefully ( maintain in an upright position during transport). Section 4 Decontamination of Spills 4.1 Spills in BSC In the event of a spill, all sur faces and items shall be surfac e decontaminated before being removed from the BSC. If the spill results in puddles: Flood the area with an appropriat e disinfectant, such as 10% ch lorine bleach and let it react for 15 to 30 minutes. If a drain system is involved, consult the BSC manufacturer's s pecific instructions reg arding decontamination. After the bleach treatment, wipe the area clean with water foll owed by 70% ethanol. Discard any item that may have become contaminated. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 17 After a spill is decontaminated, the area shall be thoroughly c leaned and dried. Residual materials can support the growth and multiplication of microorganisms, and can jeopardize the product protection normally provided by BSCs. 4.2 Spills in the Laboratory Use the guidelines below for response to spills of BSL3 materia l outside of the biosafety cabinet or any other incident that may have generated an aerosol in the containment laboratory, such as failure of physical containment devices during centrifugation. 4.2.1 Immediate Action: Hold breath and leave room immed iately; notify others in the ro om to evacuate immediately. Remove outer gloves and drop on la b floor prior to entering the ante room Remove personal protective equipment (PPE) in the airlock or ac cess zone; turn potentially contaminated clothing inward; remove gloves la st and wash any exposed skin a reas with antiseptic soap and warm water. In the event of an exposure incident: Needle sticks/puncture wounds: wa sh the affected area with disi nfectant, antiseptic soaps and warm water for 15 minutes. Squeeze around the ar ea to encourage the flow of b lood out of wound. Mucous membrane exposure: use eyewash for 15 minutes to flush t he affected area. Post a BIOHAZARD SPILL SIGN at entry to BSL3 lab door with the recorded date and time of spill. Notify your Principal Investigator and EHS Do not reenter laboratory until it has been cleared for reentry by the P.I. or EHS. In general, a period of at least 30 minutes should be allowed before cleanup is attempted, but the time is contingent upon the supply and exhaust features of the lab. 4.3 Composition of BSL3 Spill Kit Undiluted household bleach Forceps: for handling sharps or collecting small objects Paper towels or other suitable absorbent Biohazard bags: for the collectio n of contaminated spill clean- up items Sharps container: if necessary, f or collection of needles or ot her sharps Personal Protective Equipment: Gloves (household utility gloves afford additional protection), face protection such as masks & eyewear, back-fastening gowns, Tyvek jump suits (will not drag into spill area when cleaning), plastic booties, and a powered-air-pur equipment must by enr olled in the Yale University Respiratory Protection Program and have training in the use and fit of thei r respirators prior to use. Store the BSL3 spill kit and respirator in a secure location ou tside of the BSL3 laboratory. This will prevent contaminating the kit or the need to reenter a BSL3 spill situa tion to obtain your response kit. Maintain the spill kit. Replace spill kit comp onents as they are used to prepare for the next incident 4.3.1 Spills in Incubators Since a spill in an incubator is a breach of containment, close the incubator and immediately leave the BSL3 facility. Follow the BSL3 spill response procedures outlined in section 4 .2.1 to 4.2.2. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 18 Add chlorine bleach to the tray of water at the bottom of the i ncubator. Remove the materials in the incubator wiping them with 70% etha nol or suitable disinfec tant and placing them into another incubator. Collect non-sharp contaminated mat erials in a biohazard waste b ag and place all sharp contaminated materials in a sharps container. Wipe incubator surfaces with 10% chlorine bleach solution, foll owed by water and then wipe surfaces with 70% ethanol. 4.3.2 Spills in Centrifuge A high-risk aerosol breach outside of a primary containment req uires immediate evacuation of the laboratory. Follow the BSL3 spill response procedures outlined in section 4 .2.1 to 4.2.2. Stop work immediately. Presume t he aerosolized m aterial is con taminated. The incide nt should be treated as a potential exposure. Inform all others in the area that an aerosol may have been gen erated. All persons shall evacuate the room immediately for at least 30 minutes. Notify the supervisor or Principal Investigator and EHS at 785-3555. Label the area off-limits for at least 30 minutes. As with any release of BSL3 mate rials outside of primary contai n m e n t , E H S a n d t h e P I m u s t c l e a r t h e laboratory for reentry. Put on appropriate personal protective equipment (gown, gloves, powered air purifying respirator) before entering the laboratory. Use absorbent materials to cover spill areas before the additio n of a disinfectant. Absorbent materials reduce the potential of generating an additional aerosol due to the de contamination procedure itself. Decontaminate all exposed environmental surfaces before releasi ng the room for n ormal use. Remove rotor and place in a BSC. T o decontaminate rotor, soak i t in 10% bleach or other suitable disinfectant, followed by mild detergent, then water rinse. If using 10% ble ach solution on work surfaces, allow it to air dry then follow up with 70% etha nol wipe to prevent rusting of stainless steel surface. 4.3.3 Cleaning the BSL3 Spill: Note: if the spill involves radioactive materials, also contac t the Radiation Safety Office emergency line (5-3555). Once clearance has been given to reenter the spill area by the P.I. in consultation with EHS, don the appropriate personal protective equipment and enter the lab. While wearing PPE, cover the spi ll area with paper towels or di sinfectant soaked paper towels. Slowly pour concentrated disinfectant around the edge of the spill, workin g toward the center (this will avoid enlarging the contaminated area). Avoid splashing or the creation of aerosols during this step. Allow a 15 - 20- minute contact time fo r the disinfectant. While waiting, decontaminate surr ounding floor and work surface areas where splashes or larger aerosols may have settled around the spill. Us e disinfectant soaked towels to wipe these areas (1 - 1 0% household bleach is suitable for this purpose). After the 15 - 20- minute contact time, pl ace soiled paper towel s inside the biohazard bag. Repeat the decontamination procedure. After Performing the Decontamination: Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 19 Decontaminate any reusable items such as forceps by wiping with , then soaking in a disinfectant solution. A soak in 1 - 10% household bleach for 15 - 20 minutes is suffici ent. Since bleach is corrosive, follow the decontamination with a water wip e down to remove any corrosive residues. Remove PPE, turn any exposed areas inward and place in the bioh azard bag. Generally, gloves are removed last. However, to av oid touching your face with gloved hands, remove gloves just before removing masks or eyewear. Wipe down the exterior portions of any reusable PPE such as the PAPR and utility gloves with the bleach solution. Perform the disinfectant wipe down twice. Wash your hands well with soap and water, at l east 15 - 30 seco nds. Autoclave all waste generated from the spill cleanup. Use fres h gloves for transport to the autoclave, and wash hands after removing gloves. Section 5 Work with Hazardous Biological Toxins Researchers are required to list the biological toxins involved in their experiments on their initial FORM 01 registration and on all annual FORM 01 updates. Work with high hazard biological toxins, those with an LD50 of <500 mg/kg, should be reviewed by the Office of Environmental H ealth & Safety to verify t hat appropriate safety practices and protective equipment are in place to minimize exp osure. At a minimum, the requirements established in the Yale Chemical Hygiene Plan and the biosafety practices o utlined in the CDC/NIH Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Lab oratories for the toxin or pa rent microorganism must be followed. Additional information on working with and handling toxins is in the Yale Biological Safety Manual. 5.1 Recombinant DNA Experime nts Involving Toxins Recombinant DNA Experiments involving the cloning of genes that code for toxic molecules that have an LD50 of less than 100 ug/kg body weight, must be approved before ini tiation. Toxins with very low LD50 values (< 1ug/kg body weight) require additi onal registration and approva l. Table 1 details NIH recombinant DNA registration requirements for cert ain experiments involving tox ins. The list is not inclusive. Table 1.

Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 20 5.2 Select Agent Toxins The following toxins are not regulated if the amount under the control of a Principal Investigator, treating physician or veterinarian, or commercial manufacturer or distributor does not exceed, at any time, the amounts indicated in the table below. HHS Toxins [\u00a773.3(d)(3)] Amount Abrin 1,000 mg Botulinum neurotoxins 1.0 mg Short, paralytic alpha conotoxins 100 mg Diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) 10,000 mg Ricin 1,000 mg Saxitoxin 500 mg Staphylococcal Enterotoxins (Su btypes A, B, C, D , and E) 100 mg T-2 toxin 10,000 mg Tetrodotoxin 500 mg Note: Toxin quantities shown are maximum quantities of toxins, in aggregate per PI, allowed by USDA/CDC. Note: Yale's internal watch list limits PIs to only 50% of the quantities shown here. 5.3 Toxin Work Practices Safe working practices to minimi ze exposure via ingestion, inha lation, mucous membrane contact, and absorption or penetration through the skin. 5.3.1 Work Practices An inventory control system should be in place. Toxins should store in locked st orage rooms, cabinets, or freez ers when not in use. Label toxin work areas within lab. Cover work surfaces with plas tic backed absorbent paper. Avoid generating aeroso ls; handle the powde red form carefully. Use a chemical fume hood or bios afety cabinet when feasible. Avoid the use of needles or Pasteur pipettes. Substitute plastic for glass wherever possible. Decontaminate work surfaces with 5-10% household bleach or 0.1N sodium hydroxide. Treat liquid waste with 50% hou sehold bleach (soak overnight). For T-2 mycotoxin use a combination of 50% household bleach and 0.25N sodium hydroxide. Collect and autoclave waste at the end of the day. Autoclave or chemically disinfect contaminated protective cloth ing before reuse. 5.3.2 Personal Hygiene Keep your hands away from your face. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 21 Do not eat, drink, or smoke in the lab. Do not mouth pipette. Always wash hand after removing protective clothing and before leaving the lab. 5.3.3 Labels and Transport Post biohazard sign at lab entry. Restrict access to the lab. Label equipment biohazard label used with or storing toxins. For transport, use sealed, unbreakable, leakproof containers wi th a biohazard label, full toxin name, and lab phone number. 5.3.4 Protective Clothing Requirements Lab coat buttoned to the top with knit or grip cuffs, use glove s that are long enough to cover the sleeves; a back-fastening gown is suitable; sleeve covers offer additional protection. Gloves (consider double gloving). Face protection such as a face s hield or safety glasses and a m ask to cover the eye s, nose and mouth. Dedicate protective clothing for work with toxins and do not we ar outside the lab.

Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 22 Section 6 Select Agents Select agents are materials that have been identified by the U. S. Government as agents with potential for use in biological terrorism or warfare. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventio n (CDC) and the Animal Plant H ealth Inspection Service (APHIS), through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), regulate select agents in the United States and its territories. Each agency has developed and maintains a list of select agents , including human, animal, and plant pathogens, high-risk toxins of biological origin, and prions. The current list of select agents is pr ovided in Section 6.2 and can also be accessed from the web sites below: The Select Agent Registry home page: http://www.selectagents.gov/ (or search the internet for the term Federal Select Agent Program. Additional web links for select agent information are provided below. CDC Division of Select Agents and Toxins: https://www.cdc. gov/phpr/dsat.htm USDA Agriculture The federal select agent regulations were updated and changes h ave taken effect as of March 21, 2017. The most significant changes are an update of the select agents and toxi ns list () and the change in the permissible amounts of toxins allowed per laboratory for exemption from registratio n. The list of Tier 1 select agents and toxins has also been updated a nd is available in Section 6.3. Institution s that possess or work with Tier 1 agents will have to implement additional personnel screening and ongoing personal s creening requirements beyond the current federal background checks. Yale Universit y is not curren tly registered for Tier 1 agents. A personnel screening program will be developed prior to the receipt of Tier 1 agents. In ad dition to the enhanced screening requirements for personnel with access to Tier 1 select agents, additional physi cal security measures have been added for locations where Tier 1 select agents are ei ther stored or used. Yale Uni versity's current select agent laboratory is in conformity with the additional physical security measures that are required for research with Tier 1 select agents and toxins. National concerns over select agents have led to an expansion i n security requirements for these materials. As a result, entities and researchers in possession of these materia ls have additional obligatio ns and responsibilities for their safe storage, use, transfer, and disposal. 6.1 Possession, Use, or Transfer of S elect Agents In order to possess, use, send or receive Select Agents, an ins titution and each individual who will have access to the Select Agent(s) must first satisfy the following requiremen ts. Each requirement must be approved prior to possession, use or transfer. Register with the applicable U.S. Governing bodies (CDC, APHIS, and/or USDA) through the Yale Office of Environmental Health & Safety (EHS). Register with the State of Connecticut Department of Public Hea lth through Yale EHS. This is required for those Select Agents that are human pathogens. Official authorization granted for each individual requesting a ccess to Select Agents provided by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, the applicable U.S. Governing body, and Yale University. Please note that violations of Select Agent rules and regulatio ns can lead to severe criminal or civil penalties. Imprisonment and fines up to $250,000.00 may be levied against individuals who are found in violation of these laws.

Protocols for research involving recombinant DNA must be submit ted to Biosafety at Yale Environmental Health and Safety. The Biosafety Officer will review and submit the a pplication to the Biologi cal Safety Committee. Section 9 Autoclave Validation State regulation requires autoclaves used for final destruction of biomedical waste to be evaluated with respect to effectiveness of the sterilization process, temperature and pre ssure at least once during every forty hours of operation. A log recording temper ature and pressure readings an d results of biological tests is also required. EHS requires laboratory autoclaves to be tested quarterly if used f or initial decontamination of biomedical waste before shipping off campus for incineration. Steam sterilization is the most reliable means for complete des truction of all microbial l ife including bacterial spores. Autoclaves accomplish this by generating moist, high t emperature, pressurized steam within a sealed chamber. There are two types of steam sterilizers referred to as autocla ves: Gravity flow sterilizers must reach a temperature of 250 F (121C) at 15 pounds per square inch of pressure for 60 minutes. Vacuum type sterilizers must reach a temperature of 270 F (132C) at 27 pounds per square inch of pressure for 45 minutes. Personal protection equipment (P PE) such as rubberized aprons, full face shields and heat and liquid resistant gloves must be worn when operating autoclaves. Each appropriately packaged item in a load must be placed so th at steam penetrates into and among all materials to be decontaminated. Tightly sealed or stoppered materials may not be effectively decontaminated and may become dangerously pressurized causing injury when removed from the autoclave. Routine physical controls such as pressure gauges and temperatu re gauges are to be considered secondary methods of ensuring a sterilization cycl e. Regular chemical monitoring of temperature and periodic biological monitoring must be performed and recorded. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 31 9.1 Biological Indicator Tests Biological indicator tests must be conducted on steam sterilize rs periodically to evaluate the effectiveness of the sterilization process. Tests are conducted using a spore strip or a vial test containing Bac illus stearothermophilus. Biological indicators place at locations through the autoclave are the best indicatio n of sterilization. Note: Autoclave temperature sensitive tape is not a reliable me ans to determine if the time, temperature and pressure combination of the process was adequate to penetrate a nd kill microorgani sms contained within the load. Temperature sensitive tape only indicates that the desired temp erature was reached, it does not indicate that the appropriate temperature and pressure were achieved. Tests must include the capacity of the sterilization process to kill Bacillus stear othermophilus. A log must be maintained to record: dates of test test results 9.2 Chemical Test Temperature sensitive tape must be affixed to the primary conta iners of medical waste to indicate the desired temperature was reached. If the temperature sensitive tape does not indicate a temperatu re of at least 250 F (121C) was reached during the sterilization process, the biome dical waste is not considered d econtaminated. Section 10 Forms Forms required to be submitted to EHS prior to working with age nts requiring BSL3 containment are provided below.

The document may also be accessed at https://www.cdc.gov/biosaf ety/publications/bmbl5/ . Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) Biosafety Level 3 is applicable to clinical, diagnostic, teachi ng, research, or production facilities where work is performed with indigenous or exotic agents that may cause se rious or potentially lethal disease through the inhalation route of exposure. Laboratory personnel must receive specific training in handling pathogenic and potentially lethal agents, and must be supervised by scientists competent in handling infectious agents and associated procedures. All procedures involving the manipulation of infectious materia ls must be conducted within BSCs or other physical containment devices. A BSL-3 laboratory has special engineering and design features. The following standard and special safety practices, equipment, and facility requirements apply to BSL-3. A. Standard Microbiological Practices 1. The laboratory supervisor must enforce the institutional polici es that control access to the laboratory. 2. Persons must wash their hands a fter working with potentially ha zardous materials and before leaving the laboratory. 3. Eating, drinking, smoking, handl ing contact lenses, applying co smetics, and storing food for human consumption must not be pe rmitted in laboratory areas. Fo od must be stored outside the laboratory area in cabinets or r efrigerators designated and use d for this purpose. 4. Mouth pipetting is prohibited; m echanical pipetting devices mus t be used. 5. Policies for the safe handling of sharps, such as needles, scal pels, pipettes, and broken glassware must be developed and implemente d. Whenever practical, laborato ry supervisors should adopt improved engineering and work pr actice controls that reduce ris k of sharps injuries. Precautions, including those listed below, must always be taken with sharp items. These include: a. Careful management of needles and other sharps are of primary i mportance. Needles must not be bent, sheared, broken, recapped, removed from disposable syr inges, or otherwise manipulated by hand before disposal. b. Used disposable needles and syri nges must be carefully placed c. in conveniently located puncture-resistant containers used for sharps disposal. d. Non-disposable sharps must be pl aced in a hard walled container for transport to a processing area for decontamination, p referably by autoclaving. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 70 e. Broken glassware must not be handled directly. Instead, it must be removed using a brush and dustpan, tongs, or forceps. Plastic ware should be substituted for glassware whenever possible. 6. Perform all procedures to minimize the creation of splashes and /or aerosols. 7. Decontaminate work surfaces after completion of work and after any spill or splash of potentially infectious material with appropriate disinfectant. 8. Decontaminate all cultures, stocks, and other potentially infec tious materials before disposal using an effective method. A method for decontaminating all laborator y wastes should be available in the facility, preferably within the laboratory (e.g., autoclave , chemical disinfection, incineration, or other validated decontamination method). Depending on where the decontamination will be performed, the following methods should be used prior to transp ort: a. Materials to be decontaminated outside of the immediate laborat ory must be placed in a durable, leak proof container and secured for transport. b. Materials to be removed from the facility for decontamination m ust be packed in accordance with applicable local, state , and federal regulations. 9. A sign incorporating the universal biohazard symbol must be pos ted at the entrance to the laboratory when infectious agents are present.

Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 74 Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 75 13.2 CDC/NIH Vertebrat e Animal Biosafety Level Criteria-Animal Biosa fety Level 3 (The following information has been reprinted from the Biosafet y in Microbiological and Bi omedical Laboratories, 5th Edition, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Nation al Institutes of Health, U.S Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service, December 2009.) The document may also be accessed at https://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/ . Animal Biosafety Level 3 Animal Biosafety Level 3 involve s practices suitable for work w ith laboratory animals infected with indigenous or exotic agents, agents that present a potential for aerosol tran smission, and agents causing serious or potentially lethal disease. ABSL-3 builds upon the standard practices, proc edures, containment equipment, and facility requirements of ABSL-2. The ABSL-3 laboratory has special engineering and design featur es. ABSL-3 requires that: 1) access t o the animal facility is restr icted; 2) personnel must have specific training in animal facility procedures, the h andling of infected animals, a nd the manipulation of potentially lethal agents; 3) personnel must be supervised by individuals with adequate knowl edge of potential hazards, microbiological agents, animal manipulations, and husbandry procedures; and 4) procedur es involving the manipulation of infectious materials, or where aerosols or splashes may be created, must b e conducted in BSCs or by use of other physical containment equipment. Appropriate personal protective equipment must be utilized to r educe exposure to infectious agents, animals, and contaminated equipment. Employee occupational health programs m ust be implemented. The following standard and special safety practices, safety equ ipment, and facility requirements apply to ABSL-3. A. Standard Microbiological Practices 1. The animal facility director est ablishes and enforces policies, procedures, and protocols for institutional policies and emergencies. Each institute must assure that worker safety and health concer ns are addressed as part of the animal protocol review. Prior to beginning a study, animal protocols must be reviewed a nd approved by the IACUC and the Institutional Biosafety Committee. 2. A safety manual specific to the animal facility is prepared or adopted in consultation with the animal facility director and approp riate safety professionals. The safety manual must be available and accessible. Personnel a re advised of potential and special hazards, and are required to read and follow instructions on practices and p rocedures. Consideration must be given to s pecific biohazards unique to th e animal species and protocol in use. 3. The supervisor must ensure that animal care, laboratory and sup port personnel receive appropriate training regarding their duties, animal husbandry procedures, p otential hazards, manipulations of infectious agents, necessary precautions to prevent hazard or e xposures, and hazard/exposure evaluation procedures (physical hazards, splashe s, aerosolizati on, etc.). Personnel must receive annual Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 76 updates or additional training when procedures or policies chan ge. Records are maintained for all hazard evaluations, employe e training sessions a nd staff attendance. 4. An appropriate medical surveilla nce program is in place, as det ermined by risk assessment. The need for an animal allergy prevention p rogram should be considered. Facility supervisors should ensure that medical staff is inform ed of potential occupational hazards within the animal facility, to include those associ ated with the research, animal husbandry duties, animal care, and manipulations. Personal health status may impact an individual's susceptibilit y to infection, ability to receive immunizations or prophylactic interventions. Ther efore, all personnel and partic ularly women of childbearing age should be provided information regarding immune competence and conditions that may predispose them to infection. Individuals having these conditions should be encouraged to self-identify t o the institution's healthcare provider for appropriate counseling and guidance. Personnel using respirators must be enrolled in an appropriatel y constituted respiratory protection program. 5. A sign incorporating the universal biohazard symbol must be pos ted at the entrance to areas where infectious materials and/or animals are housed or are manipulat ed. The sign must include the animal biosafety level, general occupational health requirements, pers onal protective equipment requirements, the supervisor's name (or other responsible pers onnel), telepho ne number, and required procedures for entering and exiting the animal areas. Identification of specif ic infectious agents is recommended when more than one agent is use d within an animal room. Security-sensitive agent information and occupational health re quirements should be posted in accordance with the institutional policy. Advance consideration should be given to emergency and disaster recovery plans, as a contingency for man-made or natural disasters.1,3,4 6. Access to the animal room is limited to the fewest number of in dividuals possible. Only those persons required for program or support purposes are authorized to ente r the animal facility and the areas where infectious materials and/or anim als are housed or are manipulat ed. All persons, including facility personnel, service workers, and visitors, are advised of the potential hazards (natural or research pathogens, allergens , etc.) and are i nstructed on t he appropriate safeguards. 7. Protective laboratory coats, gowns, or uniforms are recommended to prevent contamination of personal clothing. Gloves are worn to prevent skin contact with contaminated, infe ctious/hazardous materi als and when handling animals. Double-glove practices should be used when dictated by risk assessment. Gloves and personal protective equipment should be removed in a manner that prevents transfer of infectious materials outside of the areas w here infectious materials and/o r animals are housed or are manipulated. Persons must wash their hands after removing gloves and before leaving the areas where infectious materials and/or animals are housed or are manipulated. Eye, face and respiratory protection should be used in rooms co ntaining infected animals, as dictated by the risk assessment. 8. Eating, drinking, smoking, handling contact lenses, applying co smetics, and storing food for human consumption must not be permitte d in laboratory areas. Food mus t be stored outside the laboratory area in cabinets or refrigerator s designated and used for this purpose. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 77 9. All procedures are carefully performed to minimize the creation of aerosols or splatters of infectious materials and waste. 10. Mouth pipetting is prohibited. Mechanical pipetting devices mus t be used. 11. Policies for the safe handling of sharps, such as needles, scal pels, pipettes, and br oken glassware must be developed and implemented. When applicable, laboratory supe rvisors should adopt improved e ngineering and work practice controls that reduce the risk of sharps injuries. Precautions must always be taken w ith sharp items. These include: a. Use of needles and syringes or other sharp instruments in the a nimal facility is limited to situations where there is no alternative such as parenteral injection, blo od collection, or aspiration of fluids from laboratory animals and diaphragm bottles. b. Disposable needles must not be bent, sheared, broken, recapped, removed from disposable syringes, or otherwis e manipulated by hand before disposal. Use d, disposable needles must be carefully placed in punctureresis tant containers used for shar ps disposal. Sharps containers should be located as close to the work site as possible. c. Nondisposable sharps must be pl aced in a hardwalled container for transport to a processing area for decontamination, preferably by autoclaving. d. Broken glassware must not be hand led directly; it should be rem oved using a brush and dustpan, tongs, or forceps . Plastic ware should be substitut ed for glassware whenever possi ble. e. Use of equipment with sharp edge s and corners should be avoided . 12. Equipment and work surfaces are routinely decontaminated with a n appropriate disinf ectant after work with an infectious agent, and after any spills, splashes, or ot her overt contamination. 13. Animals and plants not associate d with the work being performed must not be permi tted in the areas where infectious mater ials and/ or animals are housed or are ma nipulated. 14. An effective integrated pest management program is required. (S ee Appendix G.) 15. All wastes from the animal room (including animal tissues, carc asses, and bedding) are transported from t h e a n i m a l r o o m i n l e a k p r o o f c o n tainers for appropriate dispos al in compliance with applicable institutional, local and state requirements. Decontaminate all potentially infectious materials before dispo sal using an effective method. B. Special Practices 1. Animal care staff, laboratory an d routine support personnel mus t be provided a medi cal surveillance program as dictated by the risk assessment and administered app ropriate immunizati ons for agents handled or potentially present, before entry into animal rooms. When appropriate, a base line serum sample should be stored. 2. All procedures involving the mani pulation of infectious materia ls, handling of infected animals or the generation of aerosols must be conducted within BSCs or other p hysical containment devices when practical. When a procedure cannot be perfor med within a biosafety cabinet , a combination of personal protective equipment and other containment devices must be used. Restraint devices and practices are used to reduce the risk of exposure during animal man ipulations (e.g., physical restraint devices, chemical restraint medications). Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 78 3. The risk of infectious aerosols from infected animals or their bedding also can be reduced if animals are housed in containment caging systems, such as solid wall and bo ttom cages covered with filter bonnets, open cages placed in inward flow ventilated enclosures, HEPAfi lter isolators and caging systems, or other equivalent primary containment systems. 4. Actively ventilated caging systems must be designed to prevent the escape of microorganisms from the cage. Exhaust plenums for these systems should be sealed to pre vent escape of microorganisms if the ventilation system becomes static, and the exhaust must be HEPA filtered. Safety mechanisms should be in place that prevent the cages and exhaust plenums from becomi ng positive to the surrounding area should the exhaust fan fail. The system should also be alarmed to indicate operational malfunctions. 5. A method for decontaminating all infectious materials must be a vailable within the facility, preferably within the areas where infectious materials and/or animals are housed or are manipulated (e.g., autoclave, chemical dis infection, or other approved decontamina tion methods). Consideration must be given to m eans for decontaminating routin e husbandry equipment, sensitive electronic and medical equipment. Decontaminate all potential infe ctious materials (including ani mal tissues, carcasses, contaminated bedding, unused feed, sharps, and other re fuse) by an appropriate method before removal from the areas where infectious materials and/or animals are housed or manipulated. It is recommended that animal bedding and waste be decontaminat ed prior to manipulation and before removal from the areas where infectious materials and/or animals are ho used or are manipulated, preferably within the caging system. Develop and implement an appropriate waste disposal program in compliance with applicable institutional, local and state requirements. 6. Equipment, cages, and racks should be handled in a manner that minimizes contamination of other areas. Equipment must be decontaminated before repair, maintenance, or removal from the areas where infectious materials and/or animals are housed or are manipulated. Spills involving infectious materials must be contained, decont aminated, and cleaned up by staff properly trained and equipped to work wit h infectious material. 7. Incidents that may result in exp osure to infectious materials m ust be immediately evaluated and treated according to procedures describe d in the safety manual. All suc h incidents must be reported to the animal facility supervisor or personnel designated by the insti tution. Medical evalua tion, surveillance, and treatment should be provided as appropriate and records mai ntained. C. Safety Equipment (Primary Barrier s and Personal Protective Equi pment) 1. Properly maintained BSCs and other physical containment devices or equipment should be used for all manipulations for infectious mate rials and when possible, anima ls. These manipulations include necropsy, harvesting of tissues or fluids from infected animals or eggs, and intranasal inoculation of animals. The risk of infectious aerosols from infected animals or beddin g can be reduced by primary barrier systems. These systems may include solid wall and bottom cages covered with fi lter bonnets, ventilated cage rack systems, or for larger cages placed in inward flow ventilated enclosures or oth er equivalent systems or devices. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 79 2. A risk assessment should determine the appropriate type of pers onal protective equipment to be utilized. Personnel within the animal facility where protective clothing, such as uniforms or scrub suits. Reusable clothing is appropriately contained and de contaminated before being laun dered. Laboratory and protective clothing should never be taken home. Disposable personal protective equipment s uch as non-woven olefin cover-all suits, wrap- around or solid-front gowns should be worn over this clothing, before entering the areas where infectious materials and/or animals are housed or man ipulated. Front-button laborato ry coats are unsuitable. Disposable personal protective equipment must be removed when l eaving the areas where infectious materials and/or animals are housed or are manipulated. Scrub suits and u niforms are removed befo re leaving the animal facility. Disposable personal protective e quipment and other contaminated waste are appropriately contained and decontaminated prior to disposal. 3. All personnel entering areas whe re infectious ma terials and/or animals are housed or manipulated wear appropriate eye, face and respiratory protection. To prevent cr oss contamination, boots, shoe covers, or other protective footwear, are used where indicated. Eye and face protection must be disposed of with other contamin ated laboratory waste or decontaminated before reuse. Persons who wear contact lenses should also wear eye pro tection when entering areas with potentially high concentrations or airborne particulates. 4. Gloves are worn to pro tect hands from exposu re to hazardous mat erials. A risk assessment should be performed to identify the appropria te glove for the task and al ternatives to latex gloves should be available. Procedures may require the use of wearing two pairs of gloves ( double-glove). Gloves are changed when contaminated, glove integrity is compro mised, or when otherwise necessary. Gloves must not be worn outside the animal rooms. Gloves and personal protective equipment should be removed in a manner that prevents transfer of infectious materials. Do not wash or reuse d isposable glov es. Dispose of used gloves with other contaminated waste. Persons must wash their hands after handling animals and before leaving the areas where infectious materials and/or animals are housed or are manipulated. Ha nd washing shou ld occur after the r emoval of gloves. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 80 13.3 CDC/NIH Guidelines for Work wit h Toxins of Biological Origin (The following information has been reprinted from the Biosafet y in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 5th Edition, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Nation al Institutes of Health, U.S Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service, May 2009.) The docum ent may also be accessed at https://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/ . Biological toxins comprise a broad range of poisons, predominan tly of natural origin but increasingly accessible by modern synthetic methods, which may cause death or severe in capacitation at relatively low exposure levels. 1,2 Laboratory safety principles are summarized herein for several toxins currently regulated as \"Select and selected Additional d etails are provided in the agent summary statements. General Considerations for Toxin Use Laboratory work with most toxins, in amounts routinely employed in the biomedical sciences, can be performed safely with minimal risk to the worker and negligible risk to t he surrounding community. Toxins do not replicate, are not infectious, and are difficult to transmit mechanically or manually from person to person. Many commonly employed toxins have very low volatility and, especially in the case of protein toxins, are relatively unstable in the environment; these characteristics further limit the spread of toxins. Toxins can be handled using established general guidelines for toxic or highly-toxic chemicals with the incorporation of additional safety and security measures based upon a risk assessment for each specific laboratory operation. 3,4 The main laboratory risks are accidental exposure by direct co ntamination of mouth, eyes or other mucous membranes; by inadvertent aerosol generation; and by nee dle-sticks or other accidents that may compromise the normal barrier of the skin. Training and Laboratory Planning Each laboratory worker must be trained in the theory and practi ce of the toxins to be used, with special emphasis on the nature of the practical h azards associated with laborato ry operations. This includes how to handle transfers of liquids containing toxin, whe re to place waste solutions and contaminated materials or equipment, and how to decontaminate work areas after routine operations, as well as a fter accidental spills. The worker must be reliable and sufficiently adept at all re quired manipulations before bei ng provided with toxin. A risk assessment should be conducted to develop safe operating procedures before undertaking laboratory operations with toxins; suggested \"pre-operational checklists\" for working with toxins are available. 4 For complex operations, it is recommended that new workers undergo supervis ed practice runs in which the exact laboratory procedures to be undertaken are rehearsed without active toxin. If toxins and infectious agents are used together, then both must be considered whe n containment equipment is sele cted and safety procedures are developed. Likewise, animal safety practices must be considered for toxin work involving animals. Each laboratory that uses toxi ns should develop a specific chem ical hygiene plan. The National Research Council has provided a review of prudent laboratory practices when hand ling toxic and highly toxic chemicals, including the development of chemical hygiene plans and guidelines for co mpliance with regulations governing occupational safety and health, hazard communi cation, and environmental prot ection.5 An inventory control system should be in place to account for t oxin use and disposition. If toxins are stored in the laboratory, containers should be sealed, labeled, and secured t o ensure restricted access; refrigerators and other storage containers should be cl early labeled and provide contac t information for trained, responsible laboratory staff. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 81 Laboratory work with toxins should be done only in designated r ooms with controlled access and at pre-determined bench areas. When toxins are in use, the room should be clearly posted: \"Toxins in Use\u2014Authorized Personnel Only.\" Unrelated and nonessen tial work should be restricted fro m areas where stock solutions of toxin or organisms producing toxin are used. Visitors or other untrained personnel granted laboratory access must be monitored and protected from inadvertently handling laboratory equipment used to manipulate the toxin or organism. Safety Equipment and Containment Routine operations with dilute toxin solutions are conducted un der BSL-2 conditions with the aid of personal protective equipment and a well-m aintained BSC or comparable en gineering controls. 6 Engineering controls should be selected according to the risk assessment for each sp ecific toxin operation. A c ertified BSC or chemical fume hood will suffice for routin e operations with most protein toxins. Low molecular weight toxin solutions, or work involving volatile chemical s or radionucleotides combined with toxin solutions, may require the use of a charcoal-based hood filter in addition to HEPA filtration. All work with toxins should be conducted within the operational ly effective zone of th e hood or BSC, and each user should verify the inward airflow before initiating work. W hen using an open-fronted fume hood or BSC, workers should wear suitable labo ratory PPE to protect the hand s and arms, such as laboratory coats, smocks, or coveralls and disposable gloves. When working with toxins that pose direct percutaneous hazards, special care must be taken to select gloves that are impervious to the toxin and the diluents or solvents employed. When conducting liquid transfers and other operations that pose a po tential splash or droplet hazard in an open-fronted hood or BSC, workers should wear safety glasses and disposable facemask, or a face shield. Toxin should be removed from the hood or BSC only after the ext erior of the closed primary container has been decontaminated and placed in a cl ean secondary container. Toxin solutions, especially concentrated stock solutions, should be transported in leak/spill-proof secondary containers. The interior of the hood or BSC should be decontaminated periodically, for example, at the end of a serie s of related experiments. Until thoroughly decontaminated, the hood or BSC should be posted to indicate th at toxins remain in use, and access should remain restricted. Selected operations with toxins may require modified BSL-3 prac tices and procedures . The determination to use BSL-3 is made in consultation with available safety staff and i s based upon a risk assessment that considers the variables of each specific labo ratory operation, especially the toxin under study, the physical state of the toxin (solution or dry form), the total amount of toxin used relative to the estimated human lethal dose, the volume of the material manipulated , the methodology, and any human or equipme nt performance limitations. Inadvertent Toxin Aerosols Emphasis must be placed on evaluating and modifying experimenta l procedures to eliminate the possibility of inadvertent generation of toxin aerosols. Pressurized tubes or other containers holding toxins should be opened in a BSC, chemical fume hood, or oth er ventilated enclosure. Opera tions that expose toxin solutions to vacuum or pressure, for example sterilization of toxin solutions by membr ane filtration, should always be handled in this manner, and the operator should also use appropriate respirator y protection. If vacuum lines are used with toxin, they should be protected with a HEPA filter to prevent entry of toxins into the line. Centrifugation of cultures or ma terials potentially containing toxins should only be performed using sealed, thick- walled tubes in safety centrifuge cups or sealed rotors. The ou tside surfaces of containe rs and rotors should be routinely cleaned before each us e to prevent contamination that may generate an aerosol. A fter centrifugation, the entire rotor assembly is taken from the centrifuge to a BSC to open it and remove its tubes. Mechanical Injuries Accidental needle-sticks or mechanical injury from \"sharps\" suc h as glass or metal imple ments pose a well-known risk to laboratory workers, and th e consequences may be catastr ophic for operations involving toxins in amounts that exceed a human lethal dose. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 82 Only workers trained and experienced in handling animals should be permitted to conduct operations involving injection of toxin solutions usi ng hollow-bore needles. Discard ed needles/syringes and other sharps should be placed directly into properly lab eled, puncture-resistant sharp s containers, and decontaminated as soon as is practical. Glassware should be replaced with plastic for handling toxin so lutions wherever practical to minimize the risk of cuts or abrasions from contaminated surfaces. Thin-walled glass equipment should be completely avoided. Glass Pasteur pipettes are particularly dangerous for transferring to xin solutions and should be replaced with disposable plastic pipettes. Glass chromat ography columns under pressure m ust be enclosed within a plastic water jacket or other secondary container. Additional Precautions Experiments should be planned to eliminate or minimize work wit h dry toxin (e.g., freeze-dried preparations). Unavoidable operations with dry toxin should only be undertaken with appropriate respiratory protection and engineering controls. Dry toxin can be manipulated using a Clas s III BSC, or with the use of secondary containment such as a disposable glove bag o r glove box within a hood or Cl ass II BSC. \"Static-free\" di sposable gloves should be worn when working with dry forms of toxins that are subject to spread by electro static dispersal. In specialized laboratories, t he intentional, controlled genera tion of aerosols from toxin solutions may be undertaken to test antidotes or v accines in experimental animal s. These are extremely hazardous operations that should only be conducted after extensive validation of equipmen t and personnel, using non-toxic simulants. Aerosol exposure of animals shoul d be done in a certified Class III BSC or hoodline. While removing exposed animals from the hoodline, and for required animal handling dur ing the first 24 h after exposure, workers should take additional precautions, including wearing protective cloth ing (e.g., disposable Tyvek suit) and appropriate respiratory protection. To minimize the risk of dry toxin gener ating a secondary aerosol, areas of animal skin or fur exposed to aerosols should be gently wiped with a damp clot h containing water or buffered cleaning solution before the animals are returned to holding areas. For high-risk operations involvin g dry forms of toxins, intenti onal aerosol formation, or the use of hollow-bore needles in conjunction with amounts of toxin estimated to be le thal for humans, consideration should be given to requiring the presence of at leas t two knowledgeable individual s at all times in the laboratory.7 Decontamination and Spills Toxin stability varies considera bly outside of physiological co nditions depending upon the temperature, pH, ionic strength, availability of co-factors and other characteristics of the surrounding matrix. Literature values for dry heat inactivation of toxins can be misl eading due to variations in e xperimental conditions, matrix composition, and experimental criteria for assessing toxin activity. Moreover, i nactivation is not always a linear function of heating time; some protein toxins possess a capacity to re-fold and par tially reverse inactivation caused by heating. In addition, the conditions for dena turizing toxins in aqueous sol utions are not necessarily a pplicable for inactivating dry, powdered toxin preparations. General guidelines for laboratory decontamination of selected t oxins are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, but inactivation procedures should not be assumed to be 100% effect ive without validation using specific toxin bioassays. Many toxins are susceptible to inactivation with dil ute sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at concentrations of 0.1-0.25N, and/or sodium hypochl bl each solutions at concentrations of 0.1-0.5% (w/v). Use freshly prepared bleach solutions for de contamination; undiluted, comme rcially available bleach solutions typically contain 3-6% (w/v) NaOCl. Depending upon the toxin, contam inated materials and toxin wast e solutions can be inactivated by incineration or extensive autoclaving, or by soa king in suitable decontaminatio n solutions (Table 2). All disposable material used for toxin work should be placed in secondary containers, autocl aved and disposed of as toxic waste. Contaminated or potentially contaminated protective clothing and equipment s hould be decontaminated using suitable chemical methods or autoclaving before rem oval from the laboratory for d isposal, cleaning or repair. If decontamination is impracticable, materials should be disposed of as toxic waste. Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 83 In the event of a spill, avoid s plashes or generating aerosols during cleanup by covering the spill with paper towels or other disposable, absorbent m aterial. Apply an appropriate d econtamination solution to the spill, beginning at the perimeter and working toward s the center, and allow suffici ent contact time to completely inactivate the toxin (Table 2). Decontamination of buildings or offices containing sensitive eq uipment or documents poses special challenges. Large-scale decontamination is n ot covered explicitly here, but careful extrapolation from the basic principles may inform more extensiv e clean-up efforts. Select Agent Toxins Due diligence should be taken in shipment or storage of any amo unt of toxin. There are specific regulatory requirements for working with toxins designated as a \"Select Ag ent\" by the DHHS and/or the USDA. Select agents require registration with CDC a nd/or USDA for possession, use, storage and/or transfer. Importation of this agent may require CDC and/or USDA impo rtation permits. Domestic trans port of the agent may require a permit from USDA/ APHIS/VS. A DoC permit may be required for the export of the agent to another country. See Appendix C for additional information.

Included are lists of representative ge nera and species known to be pathogenic; mutated, recombined, and non-pathogenic species and strains are not considered. Non-infectious life cycle stages of parasites are excluded. This appendix reflec ts the current state of knowledge and shoul d be considered a resource document. Included are the more commonly encountered agents and is not meant to be all -inclusive. Information on agent risk assessment may be found in the Agent Summary Statements of the CDC/NIH pub lication, Biosafety in Microbiological and V-C, V-D, V-E, and V-F , Footnotes and References of Sections I through IV.

The following list is from the G uidelines for Research Involvin g Recombinant DNA Mol ecules (April 2002): 13.5.1 Basis for the Classification of Biohazardous Agents by Risk Gr oup (RG) Risk Group 1 (RG1) Agents that a re not associated with disease in healthy adult humans. Risk Group 2 (RG2) Agents that are associated with human diseas e which is rarely serious and for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are often available. R is k G roup 3 (RG 3) A ge nt s that are assoc iate d wi t h se ri ous or l ethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions may be available (high individual ris k but low community risk). Risk Group 4 (RG4) Agents that are likely to cause serious or l ethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are not usually available (high indiv idual risk and high community risk). 13.5.2 Risk Group 1 (RG1) Agents RG1 agents are not associated with disease in healthy adult hum ans. Examples of RG1 agents include asporogenic Bacillus subtilis or Bacillus licheniformis; adeno- associated virus (AAV) types 1 through 4; and recombinant AAV constructs, in which the transgene does not encode either a potentially tumorigenic gene product or a toxin molecule and are produced in the absence of a helper virus. A strain of Escherichia coli is an RG1 agent if it (1) does not possess a complete lipopolysaccharide (i.e., lacks the O antigen); and (2) does not carry any active virulence factor (e.g., toxins) or colonization factors and doe s not carry any genes encoding these factors. Those agents not listed in Risk Groups (RGs) 2, 3 and 4 are not automatically or implicitly classified in RG1; a risk assessment must be conducted based on the known and potent ial properties of the agents and their relationship to agents that are listed. 13.5.3 Risk Group 2 (RG2) Agents RG2 agents are associated with human disease which is rarely se rious and for which preventive or therapeutic Yale University - Biological Saf ety BSL3 Laboratory Manual Rev ised September 2019 112 interventions are often available.
