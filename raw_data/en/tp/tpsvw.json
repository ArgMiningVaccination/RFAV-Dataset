We employ a complementary suite of activities to optimize the use - and ultimately public health impact - of TCVs while simultaneously supporting the long-term sustainability of TCV programs and collaborative partnerships. Why Typhoid? Typhoid, a serious enteric fever caused by Salmonella Typhi, is spread through contaminated food and water. While largely eliminated in industrialized countries, typhoid continues to be a substantial public health issue in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of Latin America and the Middle East. The Global Burden of Disease estimates typhoid caused more than 9 million infections and more than 110,000 deaths globally in 2019, with young children and adolescents aged 2 to 15 years disproportionately impacted. Though treatable with antibiotics, the number of cases resistant to available antibiotics is increasing. There are currently two TCVs, Typbar TCV\u00ae and TYPHIBEV\u00ae, approved and recommended for use by the World Health Organization. A single dose of TCV is safe, well-tolerated, and efficacious for at least four years, including in children younger than 2 years of age. TyVAC's Integrated Approach Engage with countries and local partners, provide assistance while fostering country ownership, strengthen local capacity, support decision-making, and enhance collaboration. Coordinate with the typhoid community, maintain momentum and attention on typhoid as a global health priority, and ensure widespread and sustainable TCV introductions. Generate new evidence related to typhoid disease burden, antimicrobial resistance, cost-effectiveness/cost-of-illness, and regional data on TCVs. Advocate with partners for an integrated approach that includes vaccines in combination with improved water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). Leadership Project Director, [ Kathleen Neuzil](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Neuzil-Kathleen/), is the Myron M. Levine Professor in Vaccinology, Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics, and the Director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. She is an internationally recognized research scientist and advocate in the field of vaccinology and has led TyVAC since its inception in 2017. She has more than 300 scientific publications on vaccines and infectious diseases.
