Table of Contents Page 6 of 65 OSF Healthcare System Pione er ACO Compliance Plan INTRODUCTION The OSF Healthcare System Pioneer Accountable Care Organization (the \"OSF Pioneer ACO\" or the \"ACO\") and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Center of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the Federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) entered into a Pioneer ACO Model Innovation Agreement (the \"A greement\") under Section 1115A (b) of the Act . The Agreement stipulates that the OSF Pioneer ACO must maintain a compliance plan and specifies the required elements of the compliance plan. Therefore, the OSF Pioneer ACO has adopted a compliance plan (the \"Compliance Plan\") that outlines the Compliance Program of the ACO . The Compliance Plan, which is designed to promote compliance with the Agreement and applicable laws and regulations, has been adopted by the Governing Committee of the ACO and applies to ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and to other individuals and entities perform ing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities. The purpose of the Compliance Plan is to provide guidance to Governing Committee members, clinical and operational leaders and managers, ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/ Suppliers and other individuals and entities perform ing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities. The Compliance Plan assists the OSF Pioneer ACO i n implementing effective internal controls that promote adherence to the Agreement and applicable laws and regulations ; safeguards ACO assets from financial penalties ; and protect s against sanctions on the part of ACO Governing Committee members, clinical and operational leaders and managers, ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities perform ing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities . It is incumbent upon the clinical and operational leaders and manager s of the OSF Pioneer ACO to provide e thical leadership to the organization and to assure that adequate systems and controls are in place to facilitate ethical and legal conduct. The Compliance Plan, together with the Philosophy and Values, and Mission and Vision of The Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis, articulates the commitment of the ACO to maintain high ethical standards, to improve the quality and coordination of care, to promote evidence- based medicine and patient -centered care, to promote engagement on the part of Pioneer Beneficiaries and their caregivers, to reduce waste and to provide a central coordinating mechanism for disseminating information and guidance on applicable laws and regulations . Compliance efforts are designed to establish a culture within the OSF Pioneer ACO that promotes the prevention, detection and resolution of instances of conduct that do not conform to the Agreement and applicable law s or regulations. The establishment of the Compliance Plan significantly advances the prevention of fraud, waste and abuse in the ACO, while, at the same time, furthering the fundamental Philosophy and Values, and Mission and Vision of The Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis. Page 7 of 65 Notwithstanding any arrangements between the OSF Pioneer ACO and ACO Participants or Pioneer Providers/Suppliers or other individuals or entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities, the ACO has ultimate responsibility for adhering to and otherwise complying fully with the terms and conditions of the Agreement and the Compliance Plan. The ACO understands that none of the provisions of the Agreement restricts the authority of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Federal Department of Health and Human Services to audit, evaluate, investigate, or inspect the ACO and ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals or entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities. Table of Contents Page 8 of 65 OSF Healthcare System Pione er ACO Compliance Plan BENEFITS OF A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM In addition to fulfilling the legal duty of ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers to ensure that they are not submitting false or inaccurate claims , the OSF Pioneer ACO enjoys various additional benefits by maintaining an effective Compliance Program . The Compliance Program makes good business sense in that it helps fulfill the fundamental caregiving mission of the ACO to patients and to the community and assists the ACO in identifying weaknesses in internal systems and controls . Other important benefits of the Compliance Program include the ability to: 1. Demonstrate in a concrete way to ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers , to patients and to the communities that OSF serves the ACO's s trong commitment to honest and responsible provider and corporate conduct 2. Enhance the ACO's reputation for integrity and quality, increasing the standing of the ACO in the community and market competitiveness 3. Improve the quality, safety , consistency and efficiency of patient care through improved accuracy and completeness of documentation 4. Increase the likelihood of identifying and preventing illegal or unethical conduct and, when detected, initiate immediate and appropriate corrective action 5. Minimize the loss to the government and to taxpayers from any false claims through early detection and reporting 6. Reduce the risk to the ACO of exposure to civil damages and penalties, criminal sanctions and administrative remedies, such as program exclusion 7. Satisfy the demands of private payers and other business partners with respect to compliance policies and controls 8. Provide a more accurate view of the behavior of ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/ Suppliers and other individuals and entities perform ing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities pertaining to fraud, waste and abuse 9. Encourage ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities perform ing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities to report potential problems and improve internal communication 10. React quickly to the compliance concerns of ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/ Suppliers and other individuals and entities perform ing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO activities and effectively target resources to address their concerns Page 9 of 65 11. Provide policies and procedures for the prompt and thorough investigation of alleged misconduct b y ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities perform ing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities 12. Create a centralized source for distributing information on applicable l aws and regulations with respect to fraud, waste and abuse and other issues The OSF Pioneer ACO recognizes that the Compliance Plan does not , in itself , eliminate fraud, waste and abuse from the ACO . However, a strong internal culture , a commitment to abide by the Compliance Plan and a sincere effort to comply with the Agreement and applicable laws and regulations significantly reduce the risk of unlawful or improper conduct. Table of Contents Page 10 of 65 OSF Healthcare System Pioneer ACO Compliance Plan ELEMENTS OF A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM The Federal Sentencing Guidelines produced by the Unit ed States Sentencing Commission, established by the Sentencing Re form Act of 1984, provide a uniform approach to sentencing defendants in F ederal court. In 1991, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines were extended to organizations found guilty o f violating F ederal law and to specify the steps that organizations should take both before and after a crim inal offense has occurred, measures that may serve to reduce the organization's culpability and, therefore, the fines or other penalties imposed. These steps , which are designed to prevent, detect and remedy violations of law, are the hallmarks of an effective compliance program. Since 1998, the O ffice of Inspector General (OIG) of the F ederal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued Compliance Program Guidance, based, in part, on the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, with respect to the elements of a compliance program for use by vari ous types of providers . The Governing Committee has established and maintains the Compliance Program, which is built on the original seven elements of the Federal Sentencing G uidelines, with the addition of Risk Assessment as a widely recognized eight h element. According to the Office of Inspector General ( OIG), the elements of an effective c ompliance program are : 1. Developing and distributing written standards of conduct, as well as new and revised written policies and procedures that reflect the commitment of OSF to compliance 2. Designating a Chief Compliance Officer and the members of the OSF Compliance Committee and the OSF Physician Practice Comp liance Committee 3. Developing and implement ing effective compliance education prog rams for ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers , as we ll as focused training for employees in various functional areas 4. Maintaining a compliance hotline\u2014the OSF Integrity Line \u2014to receive reports of possible non-compliance and adopt ing procedures to protect the anonymity of complainan ts and to protect whistleblowers from retaliation 5. Developing processes to res pond to allegations of illegal or improper conduct and to enforce appropriate disci plinary action against individuals who have violated the Agreement or applicable laws or regulations 6. Using audits and other evaluation techn iques to monitor compliance, especially in identified problem areas 7. Investigating and taking reasonable steps to prevent criminal conduct \u2014steps that may include self -reporting, cooperating with authorities and making restitution to identified victims Page 11 of 65 8. Conduct ing a review of the major compliance risks facing the ACO and an assessment of the effectiveness of the Compliance Program in addres sing these risks, and making modifications to the Compliance Program, as needed Table of Contents Page 12 of 65 1. Written Standards of Conduct and Policies and Procedures A. Standards of Conduct It is the obligation of each ACO Participant and each Pioneer Provider/Supplier and each individual or entity performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities to abide by and to conform his or her conduct to the Philosophy and Values , Mission and Vision of The Sisters of the Thi rd Order of St. Francis, to the Agreement, the Compliance Plan and the OSF Standards of Performance. These foundational documents provide a framework for the ethical performanc e of the job duties of ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers / Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities . Adherence to these standards of conduct will result in conduct that complies with the Agreement, and applicable laws and regulations . The OSF Pioneer ACO is committed to operating in accordance with the Agreement and with the Compliance P lan, with an emphasis on preventing fraud, waste and abuse. The ACO expects Governing Committee members, clinical and operational leaders and managers, ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities to function in accordance with the Compliance Plan. The ACO is committed to disseminating the Compliance Plan, providing education on its standards and directives, updating the content, as necessary, and maintaining a vehicle for the reporting of acti vities found not to be in compliance with the Compliance Plan. B. Written Policies and Procedures The Compliance Program includes compliance policies and procedures for OSF Healthcare System and compliance policies and procedures specific to the OSF Pi oneer ACO. Many of the provisions in the Compliance Plan are detailed in the compliance policies and procedures. OSF Healt hcare System compliance policies and procedures may be accessed at OSF Pioneer ACO Compliance Policies . The OSF Pioneer A CO has adopted the compliance policies and procedures of OSF Healthcare System, and OSF Pioneer ACO compliance policies and procedures are incorporated in and appended to the Compliance Plan. In any case in which there is a conflict between the OSF Healthcare System compliance policies and procedures and the ACO compliance policies and procedures, the ACO -specific policies and procedures control so far as the ACO and ACO participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities are concerned. The written compliance policies and procedures communicate the commitment on the part of the OSF Pioneer ACO to comply with the Agreement and applicable laws and regulations , with an emphasis on preventing fraud, waste and abuse. OSF Healthcare System compliance policies and procedures are developed and revised at the direction of the Chief Compliance Officer and are reviewed by the OSF Compliance Committee, the OSF Physic ian Practice Com pliance Committee and the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors of OSF Healthcare System , after which the policies and procedures are approved by the Board. Page 13 of 65 OSF Pioneer ACO policies are developed and revised at the direction of t he Chief Compliance Officer and are reviewed by the OSF Compliance Committee, the OSF Physician Practice Compliance Committee and the ACO Governing Committee. Compliance policies and procedures are reviewed at least once every three years and revised, as needed. Table of Contents Page 14 of 65 2.

Training and Education Inherent in maintaining a culture of compliance is a broad- based understanding of specific compliance requirements, instructions, proces ses and outcomes . OSF Healthcare System provides compliance education to Board members, officers, managers and employees, including physicians and other providers. This compliance education embodies the Philosophy and Values , and Mission and Vision of The Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis , and emphasizes the need for compliance with applicable laws and regulations . The OSF Pioneer ACO adopts , and supplements, as needed, the compliance training programs of OSF Healthcare System for use with Governing Committee members, clinical and operational leaders and managers, ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities. These compliance training programs fall into two broad categories: general training aimed at raising awareness of the Compliance Program and training focused on the impact of particular statutory and regulatory requirements on certain job functions. With respect to general compliance education, employees are trained on the elements of the Compliance Program, including compliance policies and procedures that are broadly applicable. An important aim of this general education is to provide useful information about the Federal and State False Claims Acts, including penalties for any violations and the whistleblower protections under these laws. This general education covers both the major areas of compliance risk, including fraud, waste and abuse, marketing practices, coding, claim development and submission , and the steps that need to be taken to prevent or mitigate the risks. The training emphasizes the affirmative du ty of employees to report compliance risks an d concerns and illegal or improper conduct. In addition, employees receive specific compliance education on the ways in which applicable laws and regulations af fect their work. For example, although all employees should understand the importance of proper billing procedures , it is essential that in -depth training on correct coding and billing be presented regularly to employees in these roles and that ongoing education on appropriate documentation be provided to physicians and other providers. Employees who are directly responsible for any part of the process that results in claim or cost report filing are to receive compliance training prior to their performing any work that results in the production of a claim or cost report. Empl oyees receive compliance education during new employee orient ation and on an ongoing basis. While the Chief Compliance Officer has overall responsibili ty for compliance education and provides internal and external training resources , maintaining an understanding of specific coverage, documentation, coding and billing and cost reporting requirements extends throughout the organization. OSF facilities and operating divisions are expected to provide employ ees with appropriate training on the importan ce of compliance with the Agreement and applicable laws and regulations that apply to their responsibilities. M anagers o f specific departments or work units are expected to identify areas that require compliance education and to assist in the delivery of training. Also, periodic professional education courses that may be req uired for certain providers are considered a part of compliance training. Page 18 of 65 Participation in compliance training on the part of Governing Committee members, clinical and operational lea ders and managers, ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities is logged, and the documentation is maintained and, on request, provided to the Chief Compliance Officer . Failure to comply with compliance training requirements may result in disciplinary action, including , for OSF employees, possible termination of employment, in accordance with the H uman Resources policy on Positive D iscipline . Table of Contents Page 19 of 65 4. Lines of Communication A. Access to the Compliance Officer In order to promote open lines of communication between the Chief Compliance Officer and OSF Pioneer ACO clinical and operational leaders and managers, ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities, the ACO maintain s, to the extent possibl e, the anonymity of individuals who contact the Chief Compliance Officer . They are assured that no ret aliation is permitted. OSF Pioneer ACO clinical and operational leaders and managers, ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities are encouraged to follow the chain of command when reporting issues or problems. They should first report issues or problem s to their immediate supervisor, manager or dir ector. OSF Employees should report personnel matters to their supervisor or to the Human Resources Department of their facility or operating division. OSF Pioneer ACO clinical and operational leaders and managers, ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities may contact the Chief Compliance Officer when they have exhausted other avenues or when they feel uncomfortable going through the norm al chain of command. In some situations, following the chain of command may not be appropriate or workable. Communications to the Chief Compliance Officer are not limited to matters of compliance with the Agreement or applicable l aws and regulations or to concerns about fraud, waste and abuse. OSF Pioneer ACO clinical and operational leaders and managers, ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities have an affirmative duty to report illegal or improper conduct and other compliance issues. In the event that they have questions or are uncertain or conf used about the requirements of the Agreement or applicable laws and regulations , they are encouraged to seek clar ification from the Compliance O fficer in their facility or operating division or from the Corporate Compliance Division . B. OSF Integrity Line and Other Forms of Communication The OSF Pioneer ACO provides employees and contractors of the ACO, ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities a method to report t o the Chief Compliance Officer, on an anonymous basis, suspected problems related to the ACO . The ACO has adopted the OSF Integrity Line of OSF Healthcare System, which contracts with an outside vendor to staff the OSF Integrity Line. The OSF Integrity Line is a vehicle for OSF employees to report illegal or improper behavior or other com pliance issues, including concerns about possible fraud, waste or abuse, HIPAA violations, conflicts of interest, theft of OSF property, and workplace violence, harassment or discrimination. Page 20 of 65 The OSF Integrity Line is not intended to be a substitute for communication between employees an d their supervisors. Employees with questions, concerns or suggestions about normal operating procedures should typically raise them directly with their supervisors. The OSF Integrity Line may be accessed by calling 800- 547-2822 or by logging -on to www.OSFIntegrityLine.alertline.com . This service is available twenty -four hours a day, seven days a week. OSF Pioneer ACO leaders and managers, ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities who contact the OSF Integrity Line are assigned a report number, a personal identification number (PIN) and a contact date. Individuals may call back or log -on again on the contact date for information about the investigation and resolution of the matter that they reported. OSF Pioneer ACO leaders and managers, ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers / Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities who contact the OSF Integrity Line m ay choose to remain anonymous. Reports are relayed confidentially to the Chief Compliance Officer or designee, who strives to maintain the anonymity of employees who contact the Integrity Line. However, a caller's identity may become known or may need to be revealed in the course of investigating a reported concern or in certain instances when government off icials become involved. Retaliation against individuals who contact the OSF Integrity Line is not tolerated. Any reported retaliation by OSF employees is handled through the OSF Positive Discipline process. Details about the OSF Integrity Line are provided to new OSF employee s during orientation or in the packet of information provided to them by the Human Resources department of their facility or operating division. The packet of information includes a brochure explaining the use of the OSF Integ rity Line and a wallet card with instructions on how to call or log -on to the OSF Integrity Line. Current OSF employees are reminded through various means of the importance of the OSF Integrity Line. Matters reported to the OSF Integrity Line or through other means are recorded by the Corporate Compliance Division and are investigated prom ptly. The nature of a reported concern, the steps taken to investigate the matter and the results of the investigation are tracked. A report that shows the num ber and types of issues reported to the OSF Integrity Line is presented periodically to the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors of OSF Healthcare System. A report that shows the number and types of ACO -specific issues reported to the OSF Integr ity Line i s presented, as the number and types of contacts warrant, to the Governing Committee of the OSF Pioneer ACO. Assertions of fraud, waste and abuse by individuals who may have participated in illegal conduc t or who may have committed other misconduct raise numerous complex legal and management issues that are exam ined on a case- by-case basis. Table of Contents Page 21 of 65 5. Disciplinary Guidelines A. Discipline Policy and Actions OSF Pioneer ACO Governing Committee members, clinical and operational leaders and managers and ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities are expected to comply wit h the req uirements in the OSF Human Resources Handbook, the OSF Standards of Performance and the Rules of Conduct in the OSF Human Resources policy on Positive Discipline . OSF Employees receive copies of the Handbook and the Standards of Performance and are required to familiarize themselves with the content and to sign an acknowledgement that they have received and understand the req uirements and standards. Violations of any requirement or standard on the part of OSF employees may result in disciplinary action, including termination of e mployment, at the discretion of OSF . B. Hiring and Background Investigations The Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the F ederal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has the authority to exclude from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal health care programs individuals and entities who have engaged in fraud or abuse or other financial misconduct . The OIG and other government agencies maintain lists of individuals and entities that hav e been excluded from participation in a Federal or State health care program. Neither the OSF Pioneer ACO nor the OSF Healthcare System knowingly employ s or engages in business with any individual and entity that has been convicted of a criminal offense r elated to health care or is listed as debarred, excluded or otherwise ineligible for participation in a Federal or State health care program. The OSF Pioneer ACO has adopted the OSF Healthcare Sys tem processes for screening all current employees, business vendors and independent contractors against the Federal and State government exclusion databases. The Human Resources d epartment in OSF facilities and operating divisions conduct s a reasonable and prudent background investigation, including a reference check, for all employees as part of the hiring process. Applicants must disclose any criminal conviction or exclusion action. Other background investigations are performed as par t of the credentialing process f or physicians and other providers. The OSF Corporate Finance and Accounting Division screens all new business vendors prior to completing a contract for services. OSF Healthcare System contracts with a third-party provider of comprehensive exclusion list checking services (referred to in the Compliance Plan as the \"Screening Services Provider\") . On an annual basis, the Screening Services Provider screens all current employees, business vendors and independent contractors against the entire Federal and State government exclusion databases listed below, and, on a monthly basis, screens against any new additions to the information in these databases.

Auditing and Monitoring The OSF Pioneer ACO recognizes that, i n order for the Compliance Program to be successful and effective, audit ing and monitoring are necessary to test and v erify compliance with the Agreement and applicable laws and regul ations . Together with conducting risk assessments (discussed below), compliance auditing and monitoring ar e mechanisms for identifying and addressing compliance problems related to the ACO's operations and performance. An audit is typically a more formal review of compliance with a particular set of internal (OSF Pioneer ACO compliance polic ies, for example) or external ( laws and regulations) standards or requirements. Audits are typically conducted by individuals who are independent from the area being audited. Monitoring refers to reviews that are repeated on a regular basis during the normal course of operations. Monitoring activities may be part of a corrective action plan to demonstrate that remedial steps continue to be effective. Monitoring may also be initiated to confirm and document ongoing compliance when no specific problems have been identified. The OSF Corporate Compliance Division maintains , on behalf of OSF Healthcare System, a Compliance Audit Program , which has be en adopted by the OSF Pioneer AC O. The Compliance Audit Program is coordinated by Compliance, Reimbursement and Clinical Auditors from the OSF Corporate Compliance Division, which contracts, as needed, with exter nal auditors who have expertise in applicable laws and regulations . Internal and external compliance audits may focus on the effectiveness of the Compliance Program, in general, or may target specific compliance issues or particular clinical or business operations. The auditing and monitoring and other activities of the Complia nce Audit Program are designed to verify that: 1. Compliance and other risks are appropriately identified and managed, proactively, when possible 2. Effective controls are in place with respect to clinical and business operations 3. Appropriate follow -up steps \u2014undertaken in response to earlier auditing or monitoring and contained in a corrective action plan\u2014have actually been taken and have had a demonstrable impact on improving operating procedures and results 4. The conduct of OSF Pio neer ACO leaders and managers, ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities is in compliance with the Agreement and with applicable laws and regulations 5. Appropriate interaction occurs between regulatory authorities and the various OSF facilities and operating divisions Page 24 of 65 Specifically, the OSF Corporate Compliance Division , with respect to the Compliance Audit Progr am, is responsible for: 1. Identifying c ompliance and other risks through c ompliance risk assessments 2. Developing and implementing an annual Compliance Audit Plan using appropriate risk - based methodology 3. Conducting or coordinating compl iance audits in high- risk areas 4. Tracking any follow -up monitoring activities undertaken to verify that remedial steps have been taken to correct deficiencies identified through auditing and that the remedial measures have resulted in reduced error rates 5. Maintaining an organization- wide database of c ompliance audit activities and findings and monitoring the database for emerging trends 6. Developing appropriate compliance education programs based on audit results The annual Compliance Audit Plan includes consideration of: 1. The Agreement 2. Applicable laws and regulations, especially new legal or regulatory requirements 3. The annual work plan of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 4. The enforcement priorities of regulatory authorities 5. The reimbursement policies of government contractors 6. The results of c ompliance risk assessments 7. The risks identified by the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors of OSF Healthcare System , the Governing Committee of the OS F Pioneer ACO, the OSF Compliance Committee, the OSF Physician Practice Compliance Committee and OSF and ACO leadership 8. The findings of earlier audits Page 25 of 65 The annual Compliance Audit Plan may call for a combination of the following types of audit activities : 1. Financial audits, including determinations of the accuracy and reliability of claim and other data developed within OSF Healthcare System and the OSF Pioneer ACO 2. Operational audits focusing on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical or business processes 3. Reviews of internal controls, including determinations of whether or not the controls are properly designed and functioning as intended 4. Reviews of compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including determinations of the effectiveness of the Compliance Program 5. Reviews of complia nce with OSF and ACO policies and procedures The annual Compliance Audit Plan may call for the use of various approaches , including: 1. Structured audits by the Corporate Compliance Division , facility or operating division managers, or external auditors 2. Onsite visits 3. Interviews 4. Document reviews 5. Questionnaires 6. Exit interviews with departing employees 7. Ongoing monitoring The annual Compliance Audit P lan and the results of audit and monitoring activity are reported to the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors of OSF Healthcare System. ACO -specific elements of the annual Compliance Audit Plan and the results of ACO -specific audit and monitoring activity are reported to t he Governing Committee of the OSF Pioneer ACO. The annual Compliance Audit P lan and the results of audit and monitoring activity are also reported to the OSF Compliance Committee and the OSF Physician Practice Compliance Committee.

Violations and Investigations Violation s of the Agreement or the Compliance Plan, failures to comply with applicable laws or regulations and other types of misco nduct threaten the status of the OSF Pioneer ACO as an honest, trustworthy and reliable provider eligible to participate in the Pion eer ACO program . Detecte d but uncorrected misconduct may seriously endanger the Philosophy and Values, Mission and Vision of The Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis , as well as the reputa tion and legal and financial status of the ACO . OSF Pioneer ACO leaders and managers, ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities have an affirmative duty to report illegal or improper conduct and other compliance issues. F acility and operating div ision Compliance O fficer s and managers must initiate prompt steps to investigate the conduct in question in order to determine whether or not a material violation of law or the requirements of the Complia nce Plan has occurred, and if so, to take the steps necessary to correct the problem. The OSF Human Resources policy on Positive Discipline outlines the steps in the process of disciplining employees for violations of the Rules of Conduct, including violation of the Compliance Program. The policy notes that, in addition to employment -related measures, criminal, civil or administrative sanctions (including exclusion from participation in a Federal or State health care program) may apply to violations of the Compliance Program. B. Reporting If a facility or operating division Compliance Officer, manager or legal counsel discovers credible evidence of misconduct on the part of any individual or entity , including any OSF Pioneer ACO leader or manager, ACO Participant or Pioneer Provider/Supplier or any individual or entity performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities, and, after reasonable inquiry, has reason to believe that the misconduct may violate the Philosophy and Values, Mission and V ision of The Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis , the Compliance Plan, the organization's compliance or other policies and procedures or criminal, civil or administrative law, then the facility or division Compliance O fficer promptly notifies the Chief Compliance Officer and Corporat e Legal Counsel . If violations of law are found, then t he Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Legal Counsel determine the appropriateness of self-reporting to the relevant government agency and the most suitable means of self -reporting available. Prompt reporting would demonstrate the good faith and willi ngness of the organization to work with government officials to correct and remedy a detected compliance problem. For example, s elf-reporting would be considered a mitigating factor by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) in determining administrative sa nctions, including penalt ies, assessments and ex clusion . Table of Contents Page 27 of 65 8. Compliance Risk Assessments Compliance risk analysis is performed, on behalf of OSF Healthcare System, by the OSF Corporate Compliance Division , by OSF facilities and operating divisions and by external parties engaged by OSF. The OSF Pioneer ACO has adopted the risk assessment protocol of OSF Healthcare System. It is incumbent on ACO Governing Committee members, clinical and operational leaders and managers, ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities to be vigilant and proact ive in iden tifying and bringing compliance risks to the attention of the OSF Corporate Compliance Division . Together with auditing and monitoring (discussed above), risk assessments are mechanisms for identifying and addressing compliance problems related to the ACO's operations and performance. A risk assessment is a process utilized to identify, measure and prioritize opportunities for improvement following a risk analysis. Included in the risk assessment is a risk profile that outlines the most significant or most urgent compliance risks to the organization. Factors that are considered in developing the risk profile include: 1. The pervasiveness of the risk across OSF or the ACO 2. The complexity of the risk 3. The impact on the culture, reputati on, finances and clinical and business operations of OSF or the ACO 4. The organization's previous experience 5. Industry trends 6. Government enforcement priorities In addition to eval uating its compliance risks, the OSF Pioneer ACO reviews the Compliance Prog ram to determine the effectiveness of the Program in addressing the risks identified, and the ACO makes modifications to the Compliance Program, as needed. Compliance auditing and monitoring priorities are determined based on the various risks. The OSF Pioneer ACO provides health care services through a variety of deliver y systems. Given the structure of the ACO, risk areas and levels vary, depending on the delivery mechanism. In the following section, g eneral compliance risk areas that apply broadly to the ACO are described. The specific compliance risks highlighted in gui dance from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) are outlined at the end of this document . Table of Contents Page 28 of 65 OSF Healthcare System Pioneer ACO Compliance Plan GENERAL COMPLIANCE RISKS 1. Submission of Accurate Claims, Other Requests for Payment and Financial Reporting The OSF Pioneer ACO believes that the development and submission of complete and accurate claims , other requests for payment and financial reports is inherent in the Philosophy and Values, Mission and Vision of The Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis and is among the expectations of Pioneer Beneficiaries . Claims must comply with applicable laws and regulations . A process must be in place for reviewing claims for accuracy and completeness on both a pre- and a post -submission basis. Claims and the clinical documentation supporting the claims must be complete and accurate and mus t reflect reasonable and n ecessary services ordered by appropriately licensed medical professional s who are ACO Participants or Pioneer Providers/Suppliers . Professional services rendered to patients must be documented in an accurate and timely manner. M edical records and other clinical documentation must support the diagnoses and the proc edures reported on the claims , and the documentation necessary for the accurate assignment of codes must be available to clinical, billing and coding staff members. Compensation for billing and coding staff members (and for consultants involved in billing and coding functions ) must not include incentive s to submit improper claims, and c ompensation must not be tied to patient volume or the volume of work produced. Ong oing compliance education must be delivered to employees who perform activities or provide information that results in the development and submission of claim s. Billing for items or services not ordered, not documented or not rendered Only certain screening tests , such as mammograms , may be covered in the absence of an order by a qualified medical professional. Even w hen ordered, a lack of documentation identify ing the services provided may result in a determination that the services are not covered. Covered services based on the types of providers rendering the service are outlined in the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual (Publication #100- 02). Upcoding, unbundling and failure to use coding modifiers properly Upcoding, unbundling and the failure to use coding modifiers properly are the outcome of incorrect coding practices. Coding instructions are found throughout the CMS manual system. Direction of the use of codes and modifiers is found in Chapter 23 of the Medicare Claims Processing Manual (Publication #100- 04). Virtually all claims use ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes or HCPCS/CPT codes as the basis of payment. ICD -9-CM codes are updated every year by CMS. CMS provides annual and quarterly updates to HCPCS/CPT codes. Notices of these coding changes are routinely provided by CMS in Federal Register issuances followed by manual transmittals describing th e changes. Page 29 of 65 An understanding of the National Correct C oding Initiative (NCCI) is essential. CCI edits apply to Medicare Part B claims and describe various combinations of codes that are not acceptable or are acceptable only if modified . Providing or billing non- covered or medically unnecessary service s as covered, except at the request of patie nts The Medicare Benefit Policy Manual defines non- covered services, and the limitation on Medicare B eneficiaries' financial liability when Medicare claims are disallowed is outlined in Sections 1879(a) -(g) of the Social Security Act . It is inappropriate to submit claims as covered for services that are known to be non- covered or medically unnecessary , unless a patient requests that OSF does so. In most instances in which non- covered or medically unnecessary services are ordered , patients must be informed prior to treatment . The requirements with respect to informing patients are explained in C hapter 30 of the Medicare Claims Processing Manual (Publication #100- 04). Duplicate billing Duplicate billing may occur for many reasons, some of which are considered simple error s. However, duplicate billing may also be indic ative of a lack of controls in billing system s or an attempt to submit claims for ser vices that have already been processed to denial or for which payments have already been made by other payers . Billing separately for services that are included in claims for other services is also a form of duplicate billing. False cost reports Accurate reporting of costs is required of all institutional providers , including Pion eer Providers . Cost reporting instructions and forms are found in Parts 1 and 2 of the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual. Credit balances Credit balances occur on the basis of claim s when provider s, including ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers, collect amounts in excess of what is allowed by Medicare payment instructions. Medicare itself may be the payer of the excess amounts , or the credit balances may occur when payments are made by both Medicare and other payers for the same service s. The requirements with respect to duplicate primary payments from Medicare and other payers are outlined in Chapter 3, Section 10.5 of the Medicare Secondary Payer Manual (Publication #100- 05). Ins tructions for reporting c redit balances are f ound in Chapter 12 of the Medicare Financial Management Manual (Publication #100- 06). Table of Contents Page 30 of 65 2. Anti-Kickback Statute an d Physician Self -Referral (Stark) Law The OSF Pioneer ACO agrees and requires ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities to agree to comply with applicable laws, including, but not lim ited to: Federal criminal law The Federal False Claims Act - 30 USC 3729 et seq . The Federal anti -kickback Statute - 42 USC 1320a- 7b(b) The Federal civil monetary penalties law - 42 USC 1320a- 7a The physician self -referral (\"Stark\") law - 42 USC 1395nn Information on the Federal False Claims Act and the Federal civil monetary penalties law is found throughout the Compliance Plan. An overview of the Federal anti -kickback statute and the Stark law is below. All items and services provided by or to\u2014and all payments to or from \u2014OSF Healthcare System or the OSF Pioneer ACO according to arrangements with referral sources must be pursuant to a written contract signed by the parties, which has been approved through the OSF corporate contract approval process. Neither OSF Healthcare System nor the OSF Pioneer ACO enter s into financial arrangements \u2014 either ownership/investment or compensation arrangements \u2014with physicians that are designed to provide inappropriate remuneration to OSF or the ACO in return for the physicians' providing services to Medicar e bene ficiaries at OSF facilities or operating divisions or Pioneer Providers . Neither OSF Healthcare System nor the OSF Pioneer ACO submit s or causes to be submitted to Medicare (or other Federal health care programs ) claims for patients who were referred to OSF hospitals or Pioneer Providers pursuant to financial arrangements \u2014either ownership/investment or compensation arrangements \u2014designed to induce the referrals in violation of the anti-kickback statute, the Stark law or other applicable laws or regulations. Anti-Kickback Statute The Federal anti -kickback statute provides criminal and administrative penalties for an individual or entity that knowingly and willfully offer s, pay s, solicit s or receives remuneration in order to induce or reward the referral of items or services reimbursable under a Federal health care program. The types of remuneration covered include, specifically, kickbacks, bribes, and rebates, whether made direct ly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind. The anti -kickback statute establishes a number of \"safe harbors,\" which are defined as transactions or relationships that meet all the standards of an applicable safe harbor and that, therefore, have immunity from any criminal or administrative penalties under the anti -kickback statute. Regulations related to the anti -kickback statute are found at 42 CFR Chapter V, Subchapter B. Section 1001. 952 describes the safe harbors. Page 31 of 65 Claims resulting fro m refe rrals made in violation of the anti -kickback statute may constitute false or fraudulent claim s under the False Claims Act. Violations of the anti -kickback statute are punishable by criminal penalties of up to $25,000 in fines or up to five years in jail or both, by exclusion from the Federal health care programs and by civil money penalties of $50,000 for each violation, plus three times the amount of each claim deemed fraudulent. Stark Law The Stark law prohibits Medicare payment for certain designated health services provided by a hospital or other entity based on a referral from a physician with whom (or with whose immediate family members) the entity has a financial relationship . For purposes of the Stark law, financial relationships consist of : Direct or indirect ownership or investment interests on the part of physicians or their immediate family members in entities to which the physicians refer, or Direc t or indirect compensation arrangements between the physicians, or their immediate family member, and the entities. The Stark law provides exceptions that are categorized as exceptions to ownership and investment interests, as exceptions to compensation ar rangements or as exc eptions to both. Sanctions for violation of the Stark law include denial of payment, exclusion from the Federal health care programs, civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per item or service, civil monetary penalties of up to $100,000 for physicians or entities that engage in a circumvention scheme to provide referrals that would otherwise violate the Stark law and CMPs of up to $10,000 per day for failure to meet a reporting requir ement under the law . Regulations under the Stark law are found at 42 CFR Chapter IV, Subchapter B, Sections 411.351- 361. Exceptions to the prohibited self -referral practices are described in Sections 411.355- 357. An explanation of the compliance risks associated with the anti -kickback sta tute and the Stark law is provided by the Office of Inspector General ( OIG) compliance program guidance, especially the supplemental guidance for hospitals. Additional direction is provided by Chapter 4 of t he Medicare Program Integrity Manual (Publication #100- 15). The chapter is aimed primarily at the activities conducted by Medicare C ontractors , but the content is also instructive for providers. Notwithstanding the information above, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has waived certain fraud and abuse laws, including the Federal anti -kickback statute and the Stark law, as the Secretary has deemed necessary to carry out the Pioneer ACO model. The Notice of Waiver of Certain Fraud and Abuse Laws in Connection with the Pioneer ACO Model outlines the conditions for the OSF Pioneer ACO to meet in order to qualify for a waiver and specifies the period of time during which the waiver is in effect. Detailed information about the various waivers is found in the OSF Pioneer ACO Compliance policies on the Pioneer ACO Participation Waiver, the Shared Savings Distribution Waiver, the Compliance with the Physician Self - Referral Law Waiver, and the Waiver for Patient Incentives. Page 32 of 65 For an arrangement to be protected, it needs to fit in only one waiver established by the Notice. A waiver under the Notice is not needed for an arrangement to the extent that it: Does not implicate a specific fraud and abuse law, or Implicates the law, but either fits within an existing safe harbor or exception, as applicable, or does not otherwise violate the law. There is no need for the OSF Pioneer ACO to apply for an individualized waiver. Arrangements that do not fit in a waiver established by the Notice have no special protection and must be evaluated for compliance on a case- by-case basis. Failure to fit in a waiver established by the Notice does not constitute, in and of itself, a violation of the laws. Nothing in the Notice affects the obligations of the OSF Pioneer ACO or ACO Participants or Pioneer Providers/Suppliers to comply with the provisions of the Internal R evenue Code and other Federal and State laws and regulations. Nothi ng in the Notice changes any reimbursement or coverage rule with respect to the Medicare program. Table of Contents Page 33 of 65 3. Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) EMTALA is the Federal law that prohibits the dumping of patients. A hospital has the obligation under E MTALA to evaluate and treat an individual who comes to the hospital emergency department (ED) . When the hospital is required to perform a medical screening examination (MSE) in order to determine whether or not the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, the hospital may not delay the MSE nor needed treatment in order to inquire about the individual's method of payment or insurance s tatus. If an individual comes to the ED for evaluation or treatment while the hospital's ED is on diversion, then the hospital is required to provide the examination or treatment despite its status as on diversion. Generally, a hospital ED may not transf er an individual with an unstable emergency medical condition, unless a physician certifies that the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks. In such circumstances, the hospital must provide stabilizing treatment to minimize the risks of transfer. Further more , the hospital must ensure that the receiving facility has the available space and qualified personnel to treat the individual and that the receiving facility has agreed to accept transfer of the individual. Certain medical records must accompany the individual . A hospital with specialized capabilities or facilities must accept an appropriate transfer of an individual who requires specialized services, if the hospital has the ca pacity to treat the individual. A hospital must provide appropriate screening and treatment services within the full range of the capabilities of its facilities and staff, which includes access to specialists who are on call. Hospital policies and procedures must be clear as to the requirement to provide access to the complete scope of hospital services. A ll ED staff members, including on -call physicians, must be trained on their responsibilities under EMTALA, including the obligation to accept individuals who are appropriately transferred from other facilities. EMTALA applie s to the outpatient provider -based departments of a hospital that are held out to the public as sites that provide care for emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment . EMTALA is found in Section 1867 of the Social Act: http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1867.htm . CMS provides guidance at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EMTALA/ . Additional guidance is offered by the OIG in its supplemental compliance program guidance for hospitals . Table of Contents Page 34 of 65 4. Conditions of Participation (CoPs) and Conditions for Coverage (CfCs) CMS develops CoPs and CfCs that providers must meet in order to participate in the Medicare program . The CoPs and the CfCs , which apply to all patients, are intended to improve the quality of care and to protect the health and safety of Medicare B eneficiaries. CMS also ensures that the standards of accrediting organizations recognized by CMS (through a process called \"deeming\") meet or exceed the requirements of the CoPs and CfCs . The OIG may exclude an individual or entity from participation in Medicare (and other F ederal health care progr ams) if the individual or entity provides unnecessary or substandard items or services or fails to meet other program requirements. Providers should be familiar with the CoPs and CfCs applicable to them. The CoPs and CfCs, as well as interpretive g uidelines and other supporti ng references are found at : http://www.cms.gov/CFCsAndCoPs/ . Table of Contents Page 35 of 65 5. Relationships with Federal Health Care Program Beneficiaries It is inappropriate to offer or transfer remuneration to a Medicare or Medic aid beneficiary that the offering party knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive items or services for which payment may be made under the Medicare or Medicai d programs. The definition of remuneration expressly includes the offer or transfer of items or services for free or for other than fair market value, including the waiver of all or part of a beneficiary's deductible or coinsurance. In other words, a provider may not offer items or services of value to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary to attract his or her business. This restriction applies to all types of providers. Violations of this restriction may result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties . Providers should famil iarize themselves with the August, 2002 OIG Special Advisory Bulletin on Offering Gifts and Other Inducements to Beneficiaries . Notwithstanding the information above, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has waived certain fraud and abuse laws, including the beneficiary inducement civil monetary penalties law, as the Secretary has deemed necessary to carry out the Pioneer ACO model. The Notice of Waiver of Certain Fraud and Abuse Laws in Connection with the Pioneer ACO Model outlines the conditions for the OSF Pioneer ACO to meet in order to qualify for a waiver and specifies the period of time during which the waiver is in effect. Detailed information about the various waivers is found in the OSF Pioneer ACO Compliance policy on the Waiver for Patient Incentives. For an arrangement to be protected, it needs to fit i n only one waiver established by the Notice. A waiver under the Notice is not needed for an arrangement to the extent that it: Does not implicate a specific fraud and abuse law, or Implicates the law, but either fits within an exception or does not other wise violate the law. There is no need for the OSF Pioneer ACO to apply for an individualized waiver. Arrangements that do not fit in a waiver established by the Notice have no special protection and must be evaluated for compliance on a case- by-case bas is. Failure to fit in a waiver established by the Notice does not constitute, in and of itself, a violation of the laws. Nothing in the Notice affects the obligations of the OSF Pioneer ACO or ACO Participants or Pioneer Providers/Suppliers to comply w ith the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or other Federal and State laws and regulations. Nothing in the Notice changes any reimbursement or coverage rule with respect to the Medicare program. Table of Contents Page 36 of 65 6. H ealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other Privacy Laws HIPAA is a sweeping law that includes anti -fraud provisions and rules that protect worker s' health insurance coverage when they c hange or lose their job. The outline bel ow provides an overview of the administrative s implification provision of HIPAA govern ing p rivacy, information security, electronic transaction and code s ets (TCS s) and National Provider Identifiers (NPIs). The Federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Offi ce for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule, and CMS administers the TCS and NPI standards. Non-compliance with the administrative s implification rules and standards is subject to civil monetary penalties . The Privacy Rule also imposes criminal penalties on persons who knowingl y obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA. The criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses, and increases further if the wrongful conduct involv es the intent to sell, transfer or use individually identifiable health information for comm ercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. The OSF Pioneer ACO acknowledg es that it is a covered entity or a business associate of Pioneer Providers/Suppliers who are covered entities . The ACO has developed procedures to protect the confidentiality of all information that identifies individual Pioneer Beneficiaries. These procedures specify that the information is confidential and that it may not be disclosed directly or indirectly except for purposes under HIPAA and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The ACO has put in place all appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the privacy and security of protected health information in accordanc e with 45 CFR \u00a7 164.530(c) . All data sharing within the ACO and communications from the ACO or Pioneer Providers/ Suppliers to Pioneer Beneficiaries complies with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and all HIPAA privacy and security guidance applicable to the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) by covered entities. The ACO uses this data to develop and implement activities related to coordinating care and improving the quality and efficiency of care for all Pioneer Beneficiaries. Privacy The Privacy R ule addresses the use and disclosure o f PHI by pr oviders and other covered entities , including ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers . The Privacy Rule also provides certain rights to patients , including Pioneer Beneficiaries, with respect to their PHI. Risks in terms of the Privacy Rule include: 1. Inappropriate use and disclosures of PHI 2. Failure to provide a Notice of Privacy Practice s (NPP) to patients at the first delivery of service to them 3. Failure to honor patients' rights, including: Failure to allow patients to access their PHI Failure to provide patients with a copy of their PHI Page 37 of 65 Failu re to make agreed- to amendments to their PHI Failure to honor restrictions on release of their PHI Failure to abide by patients' reasonable requests for confi dential communications Failure to account for disclosures of their PHI 4. Failure to obtain or abide by patients' authorization for certain disclosures of their PHI 5. Failure to provide patients with an opportunity to object to di sclosure of their PHI 6. Failure to provide timely breach notifications, as required, to patients, the media and HHS Secretary 7. Failure to execute the required agreements with Business Associates 8. Failure to meet the following administrative requirements of the Privacy Rule: Designation of a privacy official Workforce training Safeguards of PHI Complaints Sanctions Mitigation Intimidation or retaliation Waiver of rights Policies and procedures Documentation in written or electronic form Retention of documentation Providers who are covered entities , including ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/ Suppliers, must comply with patients' rights to: Ask to see and get a copy of their health records Have corrections made to their health information Receive a notice that tells them how their health information may be used and shared Decide if they want to give their permission before their health information can be used or shared for certain purposes, such as for marketing Get a report on when and why their health information was shared for certain purposes Other Federal and State laws offer additional protections for behavioral health and other sensitive information. For example: The Illinois Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Co nfidentiality Act (740 ILCS 110/ ) requires written consent, in most instances, for the disclosure of information about mental health and development disability services . The Illinois Personal Information Protection Act (815 ILCS 530/) requires notification to individuals in the event of a breach of certain \"personal information,\" such as their name, Social Security number, driver's license number or financial account number. The Chief Compliance Offic er serves as the Chief Privacy Offi cer. Page 38 of 65 Security The Security Rule applies to electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). The Security Rule requires that all covered entities , including ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers, implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of ePHI. The ma jor risks in terms of the Security Rule include: 1. Inadequate security risk assessments 2. Incomplete remediation of the risk areas id entified in risk a ssessment s 3. Failure to imp lement risk m anagement program s with appropriate approaches to the information system lifecycle The Chief Information Officer (CIO) serves as the Chief Security Officer. Transaction and Code Sets ( TCS) Standardized electronic formats using specified code sets are required for all billing transactions. The regulations designate the required data content and format for each type of covered transaction. The risks involved with failure to use the designated sets inclu de: 1. Loss of rev enue due to payment delays 2. Denial of claim s 3. The possibility of incurring civil monetary penalties National Provider Identifiers (NPIs) NPIs are numeric ten- digit identifier s, consisting of nine numbers plus a check -digit in the tenth position. NPIs are accommodated in all sta ndard transactions and contain no embedded information about the health care provider s identified. A ssigned NPI s do not expire. All providers ( as defined in 45 CFR 160.103) are eligible for NPIs. Providers who transmit any health information in electronic form in connection with a transaction for which the Secretary of Health and Human Services has adopted a standard are covered entities a nd are required to obtain and use NPIs. Providers who are not consi dered covered entities may apply and be assigned NPI s. However, entities that do not provide health care ( transportation services , for example) are not eligible to be assigned NPIs because they do not meet the defi nition of health care provider and are not subject to HIPAA regulat ions. Page 39 of 65 In certain situations, it is possible for subparts of organization health care providers , such as hospitals, to be assigned NPIs. These subparts may need to be assigned NPIs in order to conduct standard transactions on their own behalf or to meet F ederal regulatory requirements related to their participation in Medicare (and other Federal health care program s). Providers must d etermine if they have subparts that may need NPIs and, if so, obtain NPIs for the subparts or require the subparts to obtain their own NPIs. The subpart concept does not pertain to health care providers , including Pioneer Suppliers, who are individuals. Table of Contents Page 40 of 65 7. Employee and Contractor Screening No Medicare or other F ederal health care program payment may be made for any items or services that are provided by excluded individuals or entities or that are directed or prescribed by excluded physicians. This prohibition applies to all methods of payment , including itemized claims, cost reports, fee schedules or through a prospective payment system (PPS). This ban extends to payment for management or administrative services, including the processing of claims for payment, that are not directly related to patient care, but that are a necessary component of providing items or services to Medicare Beneficiaries or other F ederal health care program beneficiaries . In most instances, the practical effect of OIG exclusions is to preclude the employment of excluded individuals in any capacity. Federal law authorizes the imposition by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of civil monetary penalties ( CMPs ) against providers that employ or enter into contracts with exc luded individuals or entities to provide items or services to Medicare Beneficiaries or other Federal health care program beneficiaries. Civil monetary penalty liability may be imposed when providers that submit claims for items or services furnished, directly or indirectly, by excluded individuals or entities know or should know of the exclusions. Providers have an affirmative duty to check the program exclusion status of individuals and entities before entering into employment arrangements or contractual relationships. In the event that an OSF Pioneer ACO Participant or Pioneer Provider/Supplier is excluded from participation in any Federal health care program, the ACO is required to inform CMS no later than thirty (30) days after the exclusion and to update the list of participating Tax Identification Numbers (TINs)/National Provider Identifiers (NPIs) to remove the ACO Participant or Pioneer Provider/Supplier.

Conflicts of Interest As noted in the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on Conflict of Interest in Medical Research, Education and Practice, \"as they have evolved, relationships between industry and medicine have brought many benefits, primarily in biomedical research. They have also raised concerns that such relationships can\u2014if they are not properly managed\u2014threaten the objectivity of medical research, education, and practice and undermine public trust in critical American institutions. \" Appendix D of the IOM report lists various studies that have attempted to understand the relationship between physicians and industry. To take one example, a 1998 analysis of marketing literature and interactions between physicians and industry representatives found that \"the provision of gifts by sales personnel e ncourages an automatic response of indebtedness on the part of the receiver who will then look for ways to make repayment.\" The IOM report concludes, \"Although it may seem to be intuitively and easily recognized that people are biased in assessing themsel ves, the fact that these biases are often unconscious and unintentional is not intuitive and is largely underappreciated. The findings of research on the influence of industry on medical practice correspond closely to the findings of psychological researc h.\" For their part, OSF Pioneer ACO Governing Committee members, clinical and operational leaders and managers, ACO Participants and Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Act ivities have a duty to act honestly and with integrity and to make decisions on behalf of, and in the best interest of, the ACO and Pioneer Beneficiaries . They also have a duty to avoid the appearance of improper conduct or activity that may jeopardize patient saf ety or the public's trust in the ACO . Improper conduct or activity that may threaten the business operations or reputation of the ACO must al so be avoided. The ACO expects that individuals in positions of making or influencing decisions about vendor agreements or arrangements or other business transactions on behalf of the ACO and Pioneer Beneficiaries act in good faith in fulfilling their responsibilities. Physicians involved in industry interactions should always bear in mind the Philosophy and Values, Mission and Vision of The Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis . OSF Healthcare System and the OSF Pioneer ACO seek to ensure that relationships w ith industry remain principled; protective of the integrity of medical education, resear ch and clinical decision - making; capable of withstanding government scrutiny ; and able to uphold public expectations, including the reputations of the physicians themselves. Conflicts of interest generated by pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device or other health care-related industry activities must be resolved consistent with obligations to patient care and safety, and consistent with the business and other interests of OSF Healthcare System and the OSF Pioneer ACO . Industry support of physicians, stude nts and trainees or other medical professionals should be free of actual or apparent conflicts of interest. OSF Healthcare System and the OSF Pioneer ACO expect clinical researchers to act ethically and in full compliance with F ederal regulations, includi ng the requirements of HHS, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Public Health Service (PHS) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . OSF Healthcare System and the OSF Pioneer ACO seek to reduce or eliminate any actual or apparent conflicts of interest related to research, to encourage transparency and to protect the rights and welfare of patients , including Pioneer Beneficiaries . Page 42 of 65 The IOM understands the importance of disclosure of industry relationships as the first step in the process of identifying and responding to conflicts of interest. The IOM report states that, \"Institutions that carry out medical research, medical education, patient care, and practice guideline development depend on individuals' disclosure of their financial relationships with industry. Without such disclosure, institutions will lack the information they need to identify and assess conflicts of interest and determine what additional steps \u2014such as eliminating or managing the conflicting interest \u2014may be necessary. The r eport goes on to state, \"The disclosures need to be sufficiently specific and comprehensive to allow an initial assessment of the risk of undue influence.\" In order to manage conflicts of interest, the OSF Pioneer ACO has established a policy that: 1. Requi res each member of the Governing Committee to disclose relevant financial interests; 2. Provides a procedure to determine whether a conflict of interest exists and sets forth a process to address any conflicts that arise; and 3. Addresses remedial action for members of the governing body that fail to comply with the policy. Each member of the Governing Committee is required to complete an online disclosure form annually. The OSF Pioneer ACO has adopted the dis closure application put in place by OSF Healthcar e System. Instructions are provided in the e- mail notice that is sent to each member of the Governing Committee, and additional information is provided in the disclosure application. Upon completion of the online disclosure form, a member of the Governing Committee attests that he or she has read, understands and agrees to comply with the conflict of interest policies of OSF Healthcare System. The Governing Committee member also certifies that he or she has made all disclosures to the best of his or her knowledge. Once the member of the Governing Committee has submitted the online disclosure form, it is reviewed and evaluated by the OSF Corporate Compliance Division. If an actual or apparent conflict of interest is identified, then the Governing Committee member is informed of the status of the review process, including the need for additional information or for a management plan. (A notification is sent after review of the disclosure if no actual or apparent conflict of interest exists.) Failu re to comply with the disclosure process may incur administrative action, up to and including loss of membership on the Governing Committee. A member of the Governing Committee who is an employee of OSF Healthcare System and who fails to comply with the disclosure process is subject to the Positive Discipline Process of OSF Healthcare System.

Right to Audit ACO Records The OSF Pion eer ACO agrees, and requires Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer ACO Activities to agree, that CMS, the Federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Comptroller General or their designee(s) have the right to audit, inspec t, investigate and evaluate any books , contracts, records, documents and other evidence of the ACO, Pioneer Providers/Suppliers and other individuals or entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer AC O Activities that pertain to all of the following: The ACO's compliance with the Agreement, The quality of services performed and determination of the amount due to or from CMS under the Agreement, and The ability of the ACO to bear the risk of potential losses and to repay any losses to CMS. If, as a result of any inspec tion, evaluation, investigation or audit, it is determined that the amount of Sh ared Savings due to the ACO or the amount of shared losses owed by the ACO has been calculated in error, then CMS reserves the right to recalculate the amount of Shared Savings or Shared Losses. Table of Contents Page 44 of 65 10. Maintenance of ACO Records The OSF Pioneer ACO agrees, and require s Pioneers Providers/Su ppliers and other individuals and entities performing functions or s ervices related to Pioneer ACO A ctivities to agree, to maintain and provide CMS, the Federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Comptroller General or their designee(s) access to all books , contracts, records, documents and other evidence (including data related to Medicare utilization and costs, quality performance measures, Shared Savings distributions and other financial arrangements related to ACO activities) sufficient to enable the audit, evaluati on, inspection or investigation of the ACO's compliance with program requirements, quality of services performed, right to any Shared Savings payment, or obligation to repay losses, ability to bear the risk of potential losses and ability to repay any loss es to CMS. The OSF Pioneer ACO maintains such books, contracts, records, do cuments and other evidence, except as provided in Appendix E of the Agreement, for a period of ten (10) years from the date on which the Agreement terminates or the date of complet ion of any audit, evaluation, inspection or investigation, whichev er is later, unless: 1. CMS determines that there is a special need to retain a particular record or group of records for a longer period, and CMS notifies the ACO at least thirty (30) days before the normal disposition date; or 2. There has been a termination, dispute or allegation of fraud or similar fault against the Pioneer ACO, Pioneer Providers/Suppliers or other individuals or entities performing functions or services related to Pioneer A CO Activities, in which case the ACO retain s records for an additional six (6) years from the date of any resulting final resolut ion of the termination, dispute or allegation of fraud or similar fault. The OSF Pioneer ACO retains copies of all written and electronic Marketing Materials and Activities and appropriate records for all other Marketing Materials and Activities provided to Pioneer Beneficiaries for a period of ten (10) years from the date on which the Agreement terminates. The OSF Pioneer ACO a lso retains copies of all written and electronic communications from Pioneer Beneficiaries to the ACO, including, but not limited to, Pioneer ACO Model Notifications, Opt-Out Notifications for Data Sharing and Substance Abuse Opt-In Notifications, and reta ins appropriate records of all other communications from Pioneer Beneficiaries to the ACO for a period of ten (10) years from the final date of the period of the Agreement.
