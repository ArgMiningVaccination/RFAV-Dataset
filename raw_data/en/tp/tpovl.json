However, various countries and cultures worldwide may have different healing practices. If you are disturbed or sick and want to heal yourself, then knowing about all these rituals may help you to find the one that suits you best to solve your problems. I am writing this article after doing extensive research on numerous healing practices. First, I will talk about healing practices in different countries, then other cultures, and finally, I will list some of my favorite places for natural healing. Sounds good? Then let's start! Healing rituals around the world People from different countries around the world follow various healing rituals. These rituals are connected to their religion, beliefs, ancestors' practices, traditions, etc. Let's have a look at some of the healing rituals around the world: Healing rituals in the Philippines The Philippines has a lot of traditional healing rituals. In addition, people of different groups or cultures in the country may perform various rituals. These rituals focus on improving one's mental, physical, and spiritual self. Let's have a look at a few of the popular Filipino healing rituals: - Subada (Hilot/Ablon): A manghihilot or mangablon performs a subada healing ritual in the Philippines. The ritual involves massaging one's veins, muscles, ligaments, and bones to treat skeletal misalignment and energy imbalance. It is similar to physical therapy or osteopathy, chiropractic, or acupressure. - Herbalism: Approximately 1,500 plants in the Philippines have medicinal properties. Filipino practitioners called \"albularyo\" use these plants with prayers, mysticism, and incantation to heal people. However, albularyo usually uses only around 16 plants for the ritual. The use of these plants can be both internal and external. - Sahuma (Mangtatawas): In Sahuma healing rituals, the healer places tawas (alum), kemenyan (incense), candles from burial, and a blessed palm in a container with burning charcoal in front of the sick person. Then he does some gestures and prayers silently to heal the patient. The image formation in alum will determine if something disturbs the patient or not. - Tuob: Slightly less popular, but Tuob is still an efficient healing ritual in the Philippines. Here the healer covers the patient with a blanket and instructs them to sit in a heated jar. Then the healer will recite some healing mantras and may use essential oils to heal the person. Tibetan healing ritual The Tibetan healers believe every sickness has three dimensions: physical body, mind, and spirit. Therefore, it is essential to treat all three dimensions to eliminate the root of the disease and heal completely. Healing chod is a popular healing ritual in Tibet that helps you eliminate sickness and promotes spiritual growth. Buddhists focus on eliminating negative emotions, one of the biggest reasons behind human sickness. Tibetan rituals are another form of emotional healing rituals. Japanese healing practices Reiki is the most popular healing ritual in Japan. It is a pseudoscience practice where the healer practices a \"palm-healing\" technique. The healer encourages physical and emotional healing by transferring the \"universal energy\" through his palms. Besides, Johrei is another widespread Japanese energy healing practice that purifies your spiritual self. The healer points light towards the patient's body through his palm or an O-Hikari (sacred focal point) for healing. Traditional healing practices in India India is a place of numerous healing practices, but the traditional Ayurveda is the most popular healing ritual that people from different countries follow. Ayurveda healing is a holistic treatment which means it treats the whole body. The process starts with healing internal purification and continues with a special diet, herbal medicines, yoga, meditation, and massage therapy. Ayurvedic treatment promotes good health rather than fighting the disease. It brings balance between mind, body, and spirit. Vietnamese healing practices Thuc Nam is the most famous Vietnamese healing practice, which uses Traditional Vietnamese Medicine (TVM). It involves both herbal and non-herbal preparations. Many Vietnamese indigenous herbs are chopped or ground and consumed for TVM to heal someone. Besides bloodletting, cupping, wind snatching, wind scraping, and finger pressure are some non-herbal TVM practices. Jamaican healing practices People in Jamaican society use Folk Medicine for healing purposes. It mainly uses various medicinal plants for treatment.

Healing practices in different cultures Taking care of our physical, mental, and spiritual health should always be our top priority. We may go through various traumatic experiences, but there is always scope to heal and improve. Apart from the country's healing rituals, people from different cultures may also have their practices. Let's have a look at some of the cultural healing practices: African rituals for healing African healers believe there is no difference between the spiritual and material realms. On the contrary, they think that all life is spirit, and these two worlds work together harmoniously. Sangomas are the most popular healers in African tradition. They perform divination and specific rituals and may use herbal medicines to heal people mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Ancient healing traditions Ancient cultures believed in maintaining a balance between body, mind, and soul for healing. Therefore, they followed various methods to heal someone. However, according to the department of health (DOH) website, massage therapy is the most ancient form of healing practice. It involves uniquely massaging different body parts to release stress, tension, disease, or anything else that makes you sick. Besides, burning incense, waving cups, ingesting herbs, blowing healing scents in the crowd, and meditation are some of the oldest healing rituals. Indian Ayurveda is also considered one of the most ancient healing practices I have discussed above.
