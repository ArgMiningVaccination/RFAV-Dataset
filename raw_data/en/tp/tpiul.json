{"title": "Integrative Medicine for Cancer Patients", "author": "Mison Chun", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": "Hanyang Medical Reviews", "date": "2010-05-31", "cleaned_text": "Abstract Majority of cancer patients used CAM modalities during and even after cancer treatment. Main reasons for CAM use are to improve immunity, with expectation of fewer recurrences, and to have better quality of life. Still many patients did not reveal precise detailed information of CAM use to their physicians. Due to possible interaction between herbs and cancer drugs, it is essential for physicians to know whether their patients use CAM modalities or not and to have interest in existing evidence. This article will provide the lists of evidence and references on supplements and life styles including diet and exercise. Mind body medicine is not commonly used in Korea but there is increasing evidence on meditation and usefulness with relaxation even in supportive care. References 1.
