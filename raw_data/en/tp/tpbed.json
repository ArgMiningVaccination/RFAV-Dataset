How the Vaccine Works Novavax is a protein subunit vaccine that targets the original (monovalent) COVID -19 strain . It uses small pieces of a protein to teach our immune system to make antibodies that recognize and fight COVID -19. The vaccine does not contain the COVID -19 virus and cannot give you t he infection. Vaccine Schedule Two doses are required to complete a primary series and a booster is recommended six months after the second dose. It takes two weeks after vaccination for protection. Currently, Novavax does not have a bivalent vaccine. Mixing Vaccines Novavax can be used for any of the first two doses or as a booster, even if the previous vaccine was different (e.g. one dose of another COVID -19 vaccine and one dose of Novavax ). Vaccine Benefits The COVID -19 mRNA vaccines (e.g. Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna Spikevax) are preferred because they give stronger protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death from COVID -19, including variants. Clinical trials showed that Novavax works well to prevent getting sick from COVID - 19. Long -term protection is not known yet. We also do not know how effective Novavax is for people who have a weak immune system, have an autoimmune condition, had COVID -19 in the past, or are pregnant or breastfeeding. Speak to a health care provider to know if it is the right vaccine for you. Side Effects and Risks Some people may have side effects after vaccination - most are mild to moderate and last one to three days. Side effects usually mean that the vaccine is working. Common side effects include redness, pain, or swelling at the injection site, mild fever, headache, feeling tired, muscle aches, joint pain, chills, nausea and/or vomiting. If you h ave a serious reaction to the vaccine or the reaction does not go away after 3 days, tell your health care provider. Public health keeps track of side effects to ensure the vaccines continue to be safe. Myocarditis and pericarditis are types of inflammation in different parts of the heart. It can occur after getting COVID -19 and can be serious. This has rarely occurred after getting Novavax, and is being closely monitored. If it does occur, most cases are mild and treated with medication and rest, and get better in a few days. Get medical attention if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, or racing heartbeat after vaccination. Vaccination is still recommended as the benefits outweigh the risks. Vaccine Ingredients and Allergies The vaccine contains Polysorbate 80, salts, sugars and buffers. It does not contain eggs, gelatin (pork), gluten, latex, preservatives, antibiotics, or aluminum. In rare cases, serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) can occur. Allergic reactions can be treated and are usually temporary. Seek medical attention if you have trouble breathing, hives, or swelling of the face and throat. People with a serious allergic reaction to another COVID -19 vaccine or polyethylene glycol (PEG) can consider getting Novavax . Delay vaccination if you: Have COVID- 19 or symptoms. To get the best protection you should: Wait at least eight weeks from when your symptoms started or you tested positive (if you are getting your primary series); or, Wait at least three to six months (if you are getting a booster) Learn about when to get vaccinated after having COVID -19. Speak with a health care provider first, if you: Are pregnant, could be pregnant or are breastfeeding Have an auto-immune condition Have a weakened immune system because of an illness or treatment Had an allergic reaction within four hours after getting the first dose of a COVID -19 vaccine Have a severe allergy to any Novavax vaccine ingredients, including an allergy to Polysorbate 80 For more information , talk to your health care provider or visit our website at toronto.ca/COVID19 .
