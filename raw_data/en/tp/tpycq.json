I could not be more happy or really blown away. I have been researching and trying so many products on my daughter arms and legs because she has KP. Every doctor and dermatologist would say \" we really don't know what causes KP\" then I read an article that Dr Green Mom had posted about KP and found it could be from being vitamin A deficient.... So we tried it AND within 2 weeks after implementing this her arms were significantly better. My husband was even blown away and asked what I did. The instructions were easy and you only do it for 2 weeks every 4-6months. We could not be more happy with the results and knowing now she was a little deficient.I should have taken before and after pictures. Mama! This makes my heart smile so much!! Thank you for sharing!!! great product. great For those parents that are in the same situation of needing to get their child vaccinated, have the piece of mind of the vaccine bundle. Equip your child and their immune system with what they will need, we are happy that we did! *PLEASE NOTE: There is a restocking fee of 20% (total order cost) + the cost of original shipping for ANY/ALL subsequent cancelled/returned subscription orders if past renewal.
