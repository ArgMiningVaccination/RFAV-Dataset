Severaltypesofdermatologicaltreatmentareavailable,rang-ing from corticosteroids, vitamin for severe psoriasis [5]. However, many patients are concerned about the side effects of these treatments.Hindawi Publishing Corporation Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2016, Article ID 3164105, 13 pages http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/31641052 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine Skin atrophy may be induced by long-term use of topical corticosteroids[6].Commonadverseeventsoftopicalsteroidand vitamin D agent may be partial local irritation and skinpain [7]. Apremilast may cause nausea, upper respiratorytract infection, and diarrhea [8]. Phototherapy may increasetheriskofskincancer[9].Methotrexatewasassociatedwith the increased risk of liver injury [10]. Oral cyclosporin may havetheriskofkidneytoxicity[11].Aweb-basedsurveystudyshowedthatpatientswithpsoriasisweremoderatelysatisfiedwiththeirtreatment[12]. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which includes acupuncture and moxibustion, Chinese traumatology, andChinese herbal medicine (CHM), has was effective for treatingnailpsoriasis[23]andChineseherbalointmentthatcontainsQing-daiwaseffectiveforplaque-typepsoriasis[24]. In the United States, 2.0% of patients with psoriasis received complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)therapy[25].DespitethegrowinginterestsinutilizingCAM,there remains a critical knowledge gap on the ethnophar-macological analysis of the TCM prescription patterns for psoriasispatients. In Taiwan, the compulsory National Health Insurance (NHI) system was launched in 1995 and the NHI programstarted to reimburse TCM service in 1996. As of 2015, TheNHI program covered 99.6% of Taiwanese population [26].ToinvestigatetheprescriptionpatternsofCHMforpsoriasispatients,wetookadvantageoftheNationalHealthInsuranceResearch Database (NHIRD), which contains registrationfiles and claims data for reimbursement. We analyzed acohort of one million beneficiaries from the NHIRD from2000 to 2010. This study is important to delineate the TCMutilizationpatternsamongpatientswithpsoriasis.Itcouldberegarded as a consensus of TCM formulas/herbs for furtherpharmacologicalinvestigationorclinicaltrials. 2. Material and Methods 2.1. Data Source. This study used datasets from the NHIRD (http://nhird.nhri.org.tw/en/) in Taiwan as our previousr e p o r t s[ 1 4 ,1 8 ] .Th eN H Ip r o g r a mi nT a i w a nr e i m b u r s e dTCM services (CHM, acupuncture/moxibustion, and Chi-nese traumatology therapy) provided by TCM doc-tors.TheNHIdatabaseconsistsofregistrationfilesandorig-inal claim data for reimbursement. The large-scale comput-erizeddataderivedfromtheNHIprogramweremaintainedbytheNationalHealthResearchInstitutes,Taiwan,andpro-v i d e dt os c i e n t i s t si nT a i w a nf o rr e s e a r c hp u r p o s e s .A l lr e g -istrationdataintheNHIRDconsistofdemographiccharac-teristics,diagnosis,clinicalvisits,hospitalization,procedures,prescriptions,andthemedicalcostsforreimbursement[27]. ThediagnosticcodeswereintheInternationalClassificationof Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)formats. 2.2. Study Population and Variables. The flow chart of enrolling psoriasis patients was shown in Figure 1. A onemillion random sample from the NHIRD was selected forthisstudy.Allthepatients(=28,510)withnewlydiagnosed psoriasis (ICD-9-CM code: 696) between January 2000 and December2010wereincludedinthisstudyandthenfollowed up until the end of 2011. After a confirmed diagnosis withpsoriasis, those consulted with TCM doctors were groupedasTCMusers(=20,084)andtheothersasnon-TCMusers (=8426).Weinvestigatedthedemographiccharacteristics ofTCMusersandnon-TCMusers,includingsex,age,occu-pation,urbanization,andthetimebetweenbeingdiagnosedof psoriasis and TCM treatment. We analyzed ratio of diseases between TCM and non-TCM users.We also analyzed ten most common herbal formulas andsingleherbsprescribedbyTCMdoctorsforpsoriasispatients.Herbal formulas were listed in pin-yin name and Englishname. Single herbs were listed in pin-yin name, Latinname,and botanical plant name. TCM indications of the ChineseherbalformulasandsingleherbswerebasedonTCMtheory[28, 29]. Full botanical names comply with the International Plant Names List (IPNI;http://www.ipni.org/)and The Plant List(http://www.theplantlist.org/)[30]. 2.3. Core Patterns of Chinese Herbal Medicine.

Alloftheinformationthatcould be used to identify individuals or care providers were dei-dentified and encrypted before release. It is not possibleto identify any individuals or care providers at any levelin this database. This study was approved by the ResearchEthicsCommitteeofChinaMedicalUniversityandHospital(CMUH104-REC2-115). 2.5. Statistical Analysis. We used the SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), to analyze thedatasets retrieved from the NHIRD. Descriptive statisticswas applied to determine the demographic characteris-tics, treatment modalities, and the frequency of prescribedh e r balf o rm ula sa n ds i n gl eh e r b s .Th ed ia gn o se sw e r ec od edaccording to the International Classification of Diseases,Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes.To present the overall structure of the study groups, weEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 Exclusion of prevalent cases of psoriasis before the end of 1999N=5 0 5 4Exclusion of missing data and people without psoriasis N = 966,436 Non-TCM user N = 8,426TCM user N = 20,084All patients with newly diagnosed psoriasis N = 28,510All patients with psoriasis N = 33,564One million sample randomly selected from the National Health InsuranceResearch Database (NHIRD), Taiwan N = 1,000,000 Figure 1: Flow recruitment chart of subjects from the one million random samples obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database(NHIRD)from2000to2010inTaiwan. s h o w e dt h em e a na n ds t a n d a r dd e v i a t i o n( S D )f o ra g ea n d numberandpercentageforsexandcomorbidity.T oassessthedistribution difference between TCM and non-TCM users,the t-test was used for continuous variable (age) and chi-square test was used for category variables (sex, occupation,urbanization, and major disease categories/diagnosis). Thecrude and adjusted prevalence rate ratio (PRR) and 95%confidenceintervals(CIs)ofthoseparticulardiseasesfortheTCM users compared with non-TCM users were estimated using Poisson regression models. A value of<0.05 was consideredasstatisticallysignificant. 3. Results There were 28,510 patients who were newly diagnosed with psoriasis(Table1).Amongthem,20,084(70.4%)patientsever used TCM outpatient services. The majority (54.9%) of theTCM users were female. The mean age of TCM users was younger than that of non-TCM users (30.0 versus 34.5 years old). The majority (59.2%) of the TCM users were white- collar workers. Most of the TCM users resided in urbanized areas. The average time between onset of psoriasis and thefirstvisittoaTCMclinicwas12.0months. Regardingthetreatmentmodalitiesgiventopatientswith psoriasis, 11,609 (57.8%) patients received only CHM, while 214 (1.1%) patients were treated by acupuncture or Chinese traumatology only and 8,261 (41.1%) patients received the combination of both treatments. More than half of thepatients (=11,037; 55.0%) visited TCM clinics for more than6timesperyear(Table2). To investigate the prescription patterns of the Chinese herbalremedies,weconductedacomprehensiveanalysisandidentified ten most commonly prescribed Chinese herbalformulas (Table 3) and single herbs (Table 4), respectively.The most frequently prescribed Chinese herbal formulawas Win-qing-yin (Warm Clearing Beverage). Regardingt h es i n g l eh e r b sf o rt h et r e a t m e n to fp s o r i a s i s ,B a i - x i a n - p i (Cortex Dictamni; Dictamnus dasycarpus Turcz.) was the mostcommonlyprescribedsingleherb. To further investigate the core prescription patterns, we conducted the network analysis. We found that Mu-dan-pi (Cortex Moutan; patterns of CHM to treatpsoriasispatients(Figure2). Comparing the disease prevalence rate ratio of TCM and non-TCM group, we found that psoriasis patients withcertain disease tended to consult TCM service more thanWestern medicine consultation (Table 5). Specifically, psori-asis patients preferred to visit TCM doctors when they hadmetabolicsyndrome,hepatitis,rheumatoidarthritis,alopeciaareata,Crohn'sdisease,cancer,depression,fattyliver,chronicairwayobstruction,sleepdisorder,andallergicrhinitis.4 nationwide population-based study analyzed a cohort of one million beneficiaries from the NHIRD to investigate theTCMusageamongpatientswithpsoriasis.Wefoundthat approximately 70.4% of the patients with psoriasis visited TCMclinics.Psoriasispatientswithfemalegender,ayounger age, residency in urbanized area, and white collar had atendency to consult TCM service.

Overall, our study providedvaluableinformationandaddedvaluetotheexistingknowl- edgeregardingTCMtreatmentforpatientswithpsoriasis. In our study, women, compared with men, were more likelytouseTCM.WefoundthatthehighestTCMutilizationrate was young people. Several surveys also showed similarfindings [14, 32]; women and younger people had a higherusage of TCM. There was also a tendency for TCM usersto reside in higher urbanized area. This may be becausehighly urbanized areas have a high density of TCM doctorsinTaiwan[32]. Patients with psoriasis utilized healthcare services sig- often than those without psoriasis [33], andw ef o u n dt h a th a l fo fp a t i e n t sw i t hp s o r i a s i su s e dT C M .I nthis study, patients visited TCM services on unsatisfied with conventional therapy,recurrent symptoms, or high costs of biological agents, theymightfurtherseekadjunctiveTCMconsultation[34,35]. In accordance with other studies in atopic dermatitis or urticaria [13, 36], CHM is the most common treatmentapproaches. We found that only very few patients receivedacupuncture therapy. Regarding the visiting frequency, amajority of the patients used TCM service for more than 6times, which might be due to the confidence in symptomsrelief or effectiveness perceived by users. However, for thosewho received both treatment modalities, they tended touse TCM services more frequently. It is possible that thosepatientswhochoseacombinationofCHMandacupunctureor traumatology therapy had complicated situations thatrequiredmorefrequenttreatment.

Previousinvestigationswereconsistentwithourfindingsthatpsoriasis patients had a broad spectrum of disease category in their clinicalvisits[2,37]. Accordingtothetheoryoftraditionalmedicine,psoriasis isfurtheridentifiedbydifferentpatterns,suchasbloodheat,heat toxin, damp heat, blood stasis, and blood dryness.

Taken together with the classification and principles of TCM formulas and single herbs, our findings correspondedwith the viewpoint of TCM, which believes that the occur-renceofpsoriasissymptomsisrelatedtothebloodheat,bloodstasis, and blood dryness. However, it has to be pointed outthatfuturevalidationontheirefficacyandsafetyisnecessary. The strength of this study at least included the following aspects: First, all residents of Taiwan can access the NHIsystem with low cost and convenience, and thus the acces-sibility of healthcare, either Western or Chinese medicine,is high. Second, all patients with psoriasis were includedin this study and this nationwide population-based studyc o m p r e h e n s i v e l yi n c l u d e da l lt h ep r e s c r i p t i o n sf o rp s o r i a s i spatients.TheseTCMformulasandsingleherbsmayprovidesomethoughtintheexplorationofbettertreatmentoptions.Some caveats in this study merit comments. First, this study did not include topical Chinese herbal ointments orherbal bath, which were not the forms of TCM reimbursed by the NHI program. The NHI program only covers TCM prescriptions manufactured by GMP-certified pharmaceuti- calcompaniesinTaiwan.Futurestudytoexplorethetopical herbalproductsisnecessary.Second,theseverityofpsoriasisand efficacy of were not available in this database.
