Now, a large Swedish population-based study, published in JAMA [[1]](#fn_1) (2015;313(24):2449-2455), has identified a modest but statistically significant increased risk of malignant melanoma in men who have used PDE5 inhibitors, with a multivariate-adjusted odds ratio of 1.21 (95% confidence interval 1.08-1.36) versus non-use. The risk estimates were similar for three different PDE5 inhibitors and use of the drugs was also associated with an increased risk of basal cell carcinoma, which arises through a different pathway. The latter finding, together with other results \u2014 such as the lack of association with multiple filled prescriptions \u2014 prompt the authors to query whether the association is causal.
