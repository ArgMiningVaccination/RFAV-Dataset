If you have a smartphone, remember to download the official 2015 Annual Meeting app. It allows you to easily locate session handouts, abstracts and speaker evaluations; research speakers and add their sessions to your calendar; learn about last minute program changes and navigate the meeting with interactive maps. You can download the app from the App Store or Play Store on your mobile device. Enhanced Learning and Unique Sessions The AAAAI has been working to make the Annual Meeting a more interactive educational experience. To this end, there will be nearly 40 sessions in Houston that feature various interactive styles of learning. Expect the use of audience response systems (another reason to bring your smartphone), flipped classroom learning techniques, Q&A workshops and case- based discussions. Instead of the typical Presidential Plenary, there will be a Presidential Course on Friday afternoon and a Presidential Symposium late Saturday morning. Following our focus on improving learning, the Presidential Course is titled Instructional Methods for Active Learning. This faculty development course will translate into having a larger number of speakers and moderators who are trained in a variety of adult learning techniques. If you are interested in being a presenter or facilitator, the Presidential Course offers a great opportunity to better your teaching skills. This year's Presidential Symposium will focus on Th2 Immune Response Modifiers for Severe Airway Diseases. Topics of discussion will include asthma and COPD phenotypes and the implications for personalized medicine, the therapeutic utility of targeting Th2-high phenotype in asthma, and how COPD can have similar pathologic mechanisms and therapeutic targets as asthma. Exciting Keynotes Some of the brightest minds in medicine deliver our Annual Meeting Keynotes, and this year is no exception. Do not miss Saturday's Keynote, The Reproducibility Crisis: Causes and Consequences, presented by John P .A. Ioannidis, MD DSc. You will also have the chance to hear Gideon Lack, MD discuss the latest data from the Learning Early About Peanut (LEAP) study, and Nancy Sullivan, PhD discuss vaccine research and the Ebola vaccine during Monday's Cutting-Edge Research Keynote. Support for Our Specialty's Future Adding to the excitement in Houston is the Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Education and Research Organization, Inc. (ARTrust ) events that support funding for A/I education and research. The ARTrust Benefit: Night at the Museum promises to be a thrilling event at the Houston Museum of Natural Science. Of course, everyone is looking forward to our Third Annual ARTrust 5K Run/Walk. Seeing the A/I community come together for the 5K Run/Walk is quite a sight, so join us and make this year the most successful yet. We wish each of you an enriching Annual Meeting experience that sends you home with new knowledge, ideas and experiences to help provide optimal patient care. Sincerely, James T.

Allergy Shots: Tips to Remember If you suffer from allergy symptoms, you may wonder if allergy immunotherapy (allergy shots or allergy tablets) is the best treatment for you. The concept behind allergy immunotherapy, whether it is received in the form of shots or tablets, is that the immune system can be desensitized to specific allergens that trigger allergy symptoms. Although it requires time and patience, the payback can be long-term relief. Who Should Administer Allergy Shots? The preferred location for receiving shots is your prescribing allergist's office. Injections can sometimes be given at another facility where the physician and staff are trained to recognize and treat reactions, and have received instructions by your prescribing allergist. Healthy Tips Allergy immunotherapy, whether in the form of shots or tablets, works by building your tolerance to substances that trigger your allergy symptoms. Allergy shots have been proven effective for treating allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, allergic asthma and stinging insect allergy. Ask your allergist if you could benefit from the treatment. Most adverse reactions to allergy shots are mild, but because serious reactions can occur it is safest to have the shots given in an allergist's office. Feel Better. Live Better. An allergist / immunologist, often referred to as an allergist, is a pediatrician or internist with at least two additional years of specialized training in the diagnosis and treatment of allergies, asthma, immune deficiencies and other immunologic diseases.

AAAAI-0614-36127 27 Introduction to Session TracksNew for 2015, session listings are labelled to designate which track the session is part of - Basic Science, Clinical, or Translational. These tracks describe the primary focus of the session's content and can be used to help you identify sessions that will best meet your learning needs. To identify a session's track, look at the color in which the title is highlighted: Blue = Basic Science Gray = Clinical Tan = Translational Large sessions, such as plenaries and keynotes, will include all three types of content and so are not labelled. Sessions that are included in a program track may include other types of content but will focus on content relevant to that category. All delegates are welcome to attend sessions from any track regardless of their member type (tickets are required for any ticketed session) . Use these tracks to shape your Annual Meeting agenda to best meet your individual needs.

This includes, but is not limited to, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), X-linked agammaglobulinemia, congenital immunodeficiencies. Limitation of Use:Safety and efficacy of chronic use of recombinant human hyaluronidase in HYQVIA have not been established in conditions other than PI. BoXeD Warning: tHromB oSiS Thrombosis may occur with immune globulin products, including HYQVIA. Risk factors may include advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous indwelling vascular catheters, hyperviscosity and cardiovascular risk factors. Thrombosis may occur in the absence of known risk factors. For patients at risk of thrombosis, administer HYQVIA at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk of hyperviscosity. contrainD icationS HYQVIA is contraindicated in: patients who have had a history of anaphylactic or severe systemic reactions to the administration of IgG. IgA deficient patients with antibodies to IgA and a history of hypersensitivity. patients with known systemic hypersensitivity to hyaluronidase or Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase of HYQVIA. WarningS anD PrecautionS Hypersensitivity\u2014Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur, even in patients who have tolerated previous treatment with IgG. In case of hypersensitivity, discontinue the HYQVIA infusion immediately and institute appropriate treatment. Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (Human) of HYQVIA contains trace amount of IgA (average concentration of 37g/mL). Patients with antibodies to IgA potentially are at greater risk of developing potentially severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. thrombosis\u2014Thrombosis may occur following treatment with immune globulin products, including HYQVIA. Risk factors may include advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or estrogens, indwelling central vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. Thrombosis may occur in the absence of known risk factors. Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, such as those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies. For patients at risk of thrombosis, administer HYQVIA at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity. [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2), Patient Counseling Information (17) in full prescribing information]. immunogenicity of r ecombinant Human Hyaluronidase (PH20)\u2014Eighteen percent (15 of 83) of subjects receiving HYQVIA in clinical studies developed non-neutralizing antibodies to the recombinant human hyaluronidase component. The potential exists for such antibodies to cross-react with endogenous PH20, which is known to be expressed in the adult male testes, epididymis, and sperm. It is unknown whether these antibodies may interfere with fertilization in humans. The clinical significance of these antibodies is not known. aseptic meningitis Syndrome (amS)\u2014AMS has been reported to occur with IgG products, including Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (Human) administered intravenously and subcutaneously. Discontinuation of IgG treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae. The syndrome usually begins within several hours to two days following intravenously administered IgG, perhaps more frequently in association with high dose (2 g/kg) intravenously administered IgG. AMS is characterized by the following signs and symptoms: severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, nausea and vomiting [see Patient Counseling Information (17) in full prescribing information]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies frequently reveal pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per mm 3, predominantly from the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dL, but negative culture results. Conduct a thorough neurological examination on patients exhibiting such symptoms and signs, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis. Hemolysis\u2014 IgG products, including HYQVIA, contain blood group antibodies which may act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells (RBC) with IgG. These antibodies may cause a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and hemolysis. Acute intravascular hemolysis has been reported following intravenously administered IgG, including Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (Human) administered intravenously, and delayed hemolytic anemia can develop due to enhanced RBC sequestration [see Adverse Reactions (6) in full prescribing information]. Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis. If signs and/or symptoms of hemolysis are present after HYQVIA infusion, perform appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing [see Patient Counseling Information (17) in full prescribing information]. renal Dysfunction/f ailure\u2014Acute renal dysfunction/failure, acute tubular necrosis, proximal tubular nephropathy, osmotic nephrosis and death may occur upon use of IgG products administered intravenously, especially those containing sucrose. HYQVIA does not contain sucrose. Acute renal dysfunction/failure has been reported in association with Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (Human) administered intravenously. Ensure that patients are not volume depleted prior to the initiation of infusion of HYQVIA. In patients who are at risk of developing renal dysfunction because of pre-existing renal insufficiency or predisposition to acute renal failure (such as diabetes mellitus, age greater than 65, volume depletion, sepsis, paraproteinemia, or patients receiving known nephrotoxic drugs), monitor renal function and consider lower, more frequent dosing. Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to be at increased risk for developing acute renal failure. Assess renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, before the initial infusion of HYQVIA and again at appropriate intervals thereafter. If renal function deteriorates, consider discontinuation of HYQVIA. Spread of Localized i nfection\u2014Infusion into or around an infected area can spread a localized infection. Do not infuse HYQVIA into these areas due to potential risk of spreading a localized infection. transfusion-r elated acute Lung i njury (traL i)\u2014 (TRALI) may occur with intravenously administered IgG and has been reported to occur with Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (Human) administered intravenously. TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever. Symptoms typically occur within 1 to 6 hours after treatment. Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions [see Patient Counseling Information (17) in full prescribing information]. If TRALI is suspected, conduct an evaluation, including appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil and anti-HLA antibodies in both the product and patient serum. TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support. transmittable infectious agents\u2014 Because Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (Human) of HYQVIA is made from human plasma, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, the variant CJD (vCJD) agent, and theoretically, the classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agent. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. No cases of transmission of viral diseases or vCJD have been associated with HYQVIA. Report all infections thought to be possibly transmitted by HYQVIA to Baxter Healthcare Corporation, at 1-800-423-2862 (in the U.S.). interference with Laboratory t ests\u2014After infusion of IgG, the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in the patient's blood may yield false positive serological testing results, with the potential for misleading interpretation. Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens (e.g., A, B, and D) may cause a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin (Coombs') test. aDVerS e reactionS Common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials in >5% of subjects were: local reactions, headache, antibody formation against recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), fatigue, nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting. clinical trials experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical studies of a product cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another product and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (Human) administered intravenously: Prior to initiation of treatment with HYQVIA, 87 patients received 365 infusions of I mmune Globulin Infusion 10% (Human) encompassing 22.2 patient-years. Among the 87 patients treated, 56 (64.4%) experienced 1 or more adverse reactions. Among the 365 intravenous infusions, 158 adverse reactions occurred for a rate per infusion of 0.43.T:7.625\"T:10.375\" were administered during the trial; 230 of these infusions occurred during the ramp-up period and the other 1129 occurred during the observation period. During the observation period, 81 patients received 1129 infusions of HYQVIA, of those, 67 (82.7%) experienced one or more adverse reactions. Among the 1129 HYQVIA infusions, 456 adverse reactions occurred for a rate per infusion of 0.40. Seven of these adverse reactions were severe defined as marked impairment of function or can lead to temporary inability to resume normal life pattern; requires prolonged intervention or results in sequelae. Adverse reactions occurring in greater than 5% of subjects associated with infusions of HYQVIA vs. Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (Human) given intravenously are shown in Table 1. The majority of these adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity and did not necessitate discontinuing the infusions. Mild is defined as transient discomfort that resolves spontaneously or with minimal intervention; moderate is defined as limited impairment of function and resolves spontaneously or with minimal intervention with no sequelae. No serious adverse reactions occurred during the HYQVIA clinical trials. table 1 adverse reactions a in greater than 5% of Subjects a ssociated with infusions of Hy QVia i 10% (Human) (igiV) given intravenously a Causally related adverse events and/or temporally associated adverse events occurring within 72 hours. b Excluding infections. c Rate = total number of events divided by total number of infusions. Six subjects, 2 children and 4 adults, withdrew from the trial during the efficacy treatment period with HYQVIA due to mild to moderate adverse reactions. One child withdrew due to local pain and one due to fever, vomiting, and headaches. Of the four adults, two withdrew due to local pain and swelling, one had moderate swelling that transiently extended from the abdominal infusion site to the genitalia, and one had back injury. Antibodies binding to rHuPH20: A total of 15 out of 83 subjects who were treated with HYQVIA developed an antibody capable of binding to recombinant human hyaluronidase in the clinical trials. These antibodies were not capable of neutralizing recombinant human hyaluronidase. In the clinical trial, no temporal association between adverse reactions and the presence of antibodies capable of binding to the Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase of HYQVIA could be demonstrated. There was no increase in incidence or severity of adverse reactions in subjects who developed antibodies to Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase of HYQVIA. In all subjects, antibody titers decreased despite continued treatment. The effect of exposure to antibodies capable of binding to Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase of HYQVIA for periods longer than this clinical trial has not been evaluated. The local adverse reactions are listed by frequency in Table 2. Mild swelling around the infusion site was present in most infusions due to the large volumes infused, but in general was not considered to be an adverse reaction unless it caused discomfort. Among the 234 local adverse reactions, three were severe (infusion site pain, infusion site swelling and infusion site edema that extended from the abdominal infusion site to the genitalia); all were transient and resolved without sequelae. More than 98% of local reactions were either mild (70.5%) or moderate (28.2%) in severity. table 2 most frequent Local a dverse reactions reported in greater than 1% of i nfusion During t reatment With Hy QVia Rate per infusion = total number of events divided by total number of infusions During the combined efficacy and extension trials encompassing more than 3 years, the local adverse reaction rate was 2.6 per patient-year. During the first 12 month period (months 1-12), the rate was 3.68 local adverse reactions per patient-year. During the subsequent 12 month period (months 13-24), the rate declined to 2.12 local adverse reactions per patient-year. Finally, during the third 12 month period (months 25-36), the rate further declined to 0.37 local adverse reactions per patient-year. Sixty-six of the 68 subjects who completed the efficacy clinical trial enrolled in a prospective, open-label, multicenter extension trial to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of HYQVIA. Sixty-three of 66 subjects enrolled received HYQVIA and 3 received IGIV. Of the 63 subjects who received HYQVIA, 48 completed the extension trial. The cumulative exposure of HYQVIA across the two trials was 188 subject-years and 2959 infusions, and a maximum exposure of 188 weeks or up to approximately 3.5 years. There were no clinically observable changes in the skin or subcutaneous tissue in either the efficacy or extension clinical trials. Postmarketing experience Because postmarketing reporting of adverse reactions is voluntary and from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency of these reactions or establish a causal relationship to product exposure.

DETAILED IMPORTANT RISK INFORMATION BOXED WARNING: THROMBOSIS Thrombosis may occur with immune globulin products, including HYQVIA. Risk factors may include advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous indwelling vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. Thrombosis may occur in the absence of known risk factors. For patients at risk of thrombosis, administer HYQVIA at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk of hyperviscosity. CONTRAINDICATIONS HYQVIA is contraindicated in patients who have a history of anaphylactic or severe systemic reactions to the administration of IgG; in IgA- deficient patients with antibodies to IgA and a history of hypersensitivity; and in patients with known systemic hypersensitivity to hyaluronidase or Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase of HYQVIA. WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity: Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur, even in patients who have tolerated previous treatment with IgG. Patients with antibodies to IgA are potentially at greater risk of developing potentially severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. In case of hypersensitivity, discontinue HYQVIA infusion immediately and institute appropriate treatment. DETAILED IMPORTANT RISK INFORMATION continued on preceding page.
