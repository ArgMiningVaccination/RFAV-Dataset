The treated groups were, 1) ABAC group: challenged with Eimeria spp. + C. perfringens and diet with and anticoccidial drugs; 2) SY group: challenged with Eimer ia fed basal synbiotic; EO group: with Eimeria spp. + C. perfringens and basal diet with oils (EO); 4) SYEO group: challenged with Eimeria spp. diet with tion of synbiotics and essential oils; 5) CO group: fed basal diet and challenged with Eimeria spp.; 6) NE group: fed basal diet and challenged Eimeria spp. + C. perfringens, and 7) CN group: fed basal diet. All additives were given from 0 day (d) to 35 d. The results showed positive impact of synbiotic and EO treatments on lesion scoring and C. perfringens quantification in comparison with challenged non treated groups. The body weight did not show significant improvement (P>0.05) in SY group but the EO group increased the BW (P>0.05). The treatments significantly decreased the oocyst shedding, dropping scoring and litter scoring against coccidiosis infection in comparison with NE group (P<0.05). The ABAC group showed insignificant decline in dropping and litter scoring in comparison with synbiotic and EO treatments (P>0.05). All treatments significantly improved the histopathological lesion scoring of intestine and liver as well as the coccidial infection score (P<0.05). Our data suggest that synbioti c and essential oils may be used as potential candidates for antibiotic and anticoccidial feed additives as they can promote better intestinal health. Keywords: NE, Coccidiosis, Synbiotics, Essential oils, Broilers, Histopathology an enterotoxemic multi - factorial disease that destroys the intestinal lining of the digestive tract of both wild and domestic birds especially chickens used for meat production all over the world. Some toxins secreted from C. perfringens (Cp) types A and C are incriminate d in the necrotic lesions in the intestinal wall and mortalities which in turn leads to high economic losses estimated to be more than $3 billion/ year ( Jayaraman et al., 2013 ). Coccidiosis is an enteric protozoal disease of poultry which caused by various Eimeria spp . The losses from this disease estimated by US $3 billion / year around the world, which is mainly due to the cost of the anticoccidial BENHA VETERINARY MEDICAL JOURNAL, VOL. 36, NO. 2:187-198, JUNE , 2019 BENHA UNIVERSITY FACULTY OF VETERINARY MEDICINE Marwa et al. (2019). BVMJ -36(2): 187-198 811 feed additives, beside the death and the impaired growth of the affected birds (Shojadoost et al ., 2012). The intercurre nce between clostridioses and coccidioses is an increasing health risk to poultry (Shane, 2004). The antibiotics and anticoccidial feed additives have been used in preventing these enteric problems in the broiler industry for several years (Thomke and Elwi nger, 1998). But since banning antibiotics in animal feeds in 2006 and questioning the health risks of using anticoccidial additives (Europe Union Commission, 2005), the necrotic enteritis outbreaks in broilers rearise at countries implied to the banning ( Van Immerseel et al., 2004). Several recent studies have given main consideration to using probiotics (Dahiya et al., 2006), prebiotics (Branton et al ., 1997) and EOytobiotics (Mitsch et al ., 2004) as alternatives. The probiotics are dietary supplements that consists of live microorganisms, which have good effect on the health of animal by enhancing the microbial balance (Fuller, 1989). Prebiotics are nondigestible short - length carbohydrates that selectively stimulate the growth and / or activity of bene ficial bacteria to improve the health of the host and suppress the harmful bacteria (Garcia, 2003). Combination between probiotics and prebiotics \"synbiotic\" aims for providing the host with beneficial bacteria and the fermentable substrate at the same tim e in order to guarantee the survival of this bacteria in the host and get advantages that each one offers (Fooks and Gibson, 2002). The phytobiotics are natural new class of additives that based on herbs, spices and fruits. They enhance the productivity t hrough improvement of digestibility, nutrient absorption and elimination of pathogens in the gut as well as, they have a high acceptability among consumers (Kubkomawa et al ., 2013). The goal of this work is to evaluate the potential protective effects of synbiotic, essential oils (as a type of phytobiotics) and their combination as alternatives to antibiotic and the anticoccidial feed additives on induced NE and coccidiosis in broiler chicks . 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Birds and management : The present experiment was conducted on 210, healthy one day old broiler chicks (Arbor Acres). Birds were fed on well -balanced diet formulated according to NRC, (1994) (Table 1). They were housed in a clean disinfected well ventilated room (5m\u00d77m). The roo m was divided into 6 equal partitions for the first 6 groups (G1 - G6). The control group (G7) was housed in a separate place. The rooms were provided with suitable number of heaters, feeder and drinkers. 2.2. Experimental design and NE induction : As shown in table 2, the experimental birds randomely divided into 7 groups (30 birds/3 replicates / group). The induction of necrotic enteritis was according to Gholamiandehkordi et al., (2007). 2.3. Assessment of induced NE: Body weight: The average bod y weight of chicks for each group was recorded at 35 day old (19 dpi). Lesion scoring: At 3 and 7 days after challenge 3 birds / group were euthanized and lesions on small intestine were scored 0 -4 according to Prescott et al., (1978) as follow: 0: no gross lesions, normal intestinal appearance; 1 = thin -walled or friable, gray appearance; 2: thin -walled, focal necrosis, gray appearance, small amounts of gas production; 3: thin walled, sizable patches of necrosis, gas -filled i ntestine, small flecks of blood; 4: severe extensive necrosis, marked hemorrhage, large amounts of gas in intestine. While, the pathologic alterations on liver were scored according to Jerzsele et al., (2012) as follow: 0= none, 1= mild lesions, 2= Effect of Synbiotics and Essential Oils in Ameliorating the Negative Drawbacks of Necrotic Enteritis an d Coccidiosis 811 moderat e lesions and 3= severe lesions. The cumulative score of each organ was obtained by summation the scores of this organ at 3 and 7 dpi (Hussain, 2006). Quantification of C. perfringens: The Cp quantification was carried out according to McReynolds et al., (2009). At 3 and 7 dpi, 15 cm of jejunum cranial to Meckel's diverticulum was aseptically excised stomached for 30 seconds in 9 ml fluid thioglycollate broth (Lab M L9 -7J- UK). Ten-fold serial dilutions were performed, and then 1 ml from each dilution w as poured on tryptose sulfite cycloserine agar (Oxoid limited, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. UK). Plates incubated for 24 hrs at 37\u00b0C under anaerobic conditions. Plates containing colonies exhibiting typical mor phology with more than 30 or less than 300 colonies were counted and recorded. 2.3. Assessment of coccidiosis : Dropping scoring: The cumulative score of each group was obtained by summating the daily dropping scores recorded from 0 to 10 days post challeng e with Eimeria spp. according to (Hussain, 2006). The daily dropping score was graded from 0 -4, according to Morehouse and Barron, (1970) as follows: 0= normal color and consistency; 1= mild mucoid to watery droppings; 2 - moderate mucoid to warery with abnormal colour; 3= all watery, bloody tinged color and 4= watery bloody droppings. Lesion scoring for coccidiosis: Three birds / group euthanized at 10th dpi with Eimeria spp. to score small intestine parts (duodenum, jujenum and ilieum) and cecum for coccidial lesions according to Johnson and Reid (1970) as follow: 0= normal with no gross lesions, 1= small numerous petechiae, 3= extensive hemorrhage and 4= extensive hemorrhage that gives a dark color to the cecal intestine. T he cumulative score was obtained by summating the scores of intestinal parts for each group (Hussain, 2006). Litter scoring: On d 21 and 35, litter conditions were scored according to Abdelrahman et al., (2014) ) as follow: 0= dry, friable material throug hout the pen, 1= predominantly dry material but with some evidence of crusting around drinkers and feeders, 2= litter material is mostly acceptable but with some areas of wet shavings or capped material, 3= poor quality litter material with a large proport ion of wet areas and capping of the litter, 4= unacceptable litter quality, wet and capped but with a few areas of dry material remaining, 5 = all litter is wet and soggy, no dry areas left. The cumulative score was calculated by summatin scores of both pe riods for each group according to (Hussain, 2006). Oocyst shedding: Fresh fecal samples collected weekly (1 -5 weeks) from each group. Microscopical count carried out according to Long et al ., (1976), and represented as oocysts per gram of excreta . The cumu lative shedding was calculated according to (Hussain, 2006) . 2.4. Histopathological examination : Small intestine, cecum and liver were collected 7 dpi with C. perfringens and preserved in 10% formalin solution then examined according to Bancroft et al., (1996). The histopathological changes in these organs were scored in from 0 to 4 as follow: 0: no lesions; 1: mild lesions; 2: moderate lesions; 3: severe lesions and 4: very severe lesions. The cumulative intestinal scoring and coccidial infection was calculated according to (Hussain, 2006) . 2.5. Statistical analysis: Differences between groups were analyzed by using One -Way ANOVA and Duncan's multiple comparison Post Hoc tests (Duncan, 1955 ). 3. RESULTS Marwa et al. (2019). BVMJ -36(2): 187-198 811 3.1. Parameters of induced NE: As shown in table 3, the EO and SYEO groups showed improvement (P>0.05) in BW (1.34 Kg and 1.23 Kg respectively) in comparison with NE group (1.20 Kg). However, these treatments were in significantly lower in weight in comparison with ABAC group (1.40 Kg). The lowest BW recorded in SY group (1.12 Kg) which was significant decline in comparison with the antibiotic treated group only (P<0.05). The cumulative (cum.) scoring of small intestine (Plate 1) was si gnificantly decreased (P<0.05) in SY group at 3 and 7 dpi (4 and 4.67 respectively) in comparison with NE group (8.33 and 8 respectively). In addition, the EO and SYEO groups recorded decrease in cumulative scoring, this decline in scoring was significan t only in EO group at 3 dpi (4.33) in comparison with NE group (P<0.05). The antibiotic treated group did not show significant improvement (P>0.05) more than other treatments at different periods. The liver of EO group recorded the lowest cumulative scorin g (4.33) in all treatments and this score differed significantly from the score of NE group which was 8 (Plate 2). The colony count values (represented as log 10) were significantly increased in NE group at 3 dpi (3.13) and at 7 dpi (2.98) in comparison with the CN (0.96 and 0.51 respectively) (P<0.05). The SYEO, SY groups showed decrease in number of C. perfringens colonies at 3 dpi (2.66, 2.53 and 2.51 respectively) and 7 dpi (2.23, 1.46 and 1.97 respectively) in comparison with the NE group (3.13 and 2.98) (P>0.05). The ABAC group recorded insignificant decline of colony count (P>0.05) at 3 and 7 dpi (2.11 and 1.32 respectively) in comparison with SY, EO and SYEO treatments. 3.2. Parameters of coccidiosis: From data shown in table 4, the cumulative dropping scoring was significantly decreased (P<0.05) in all treated challenged birds (ranged from 8.67 to 10) in comparison with the NE group (17.67). The lowest cum. score (8.67) was recorded in SYEO and ABAC groups (Plate 3). The cum. lesion scoring of intestine (Plate 1) was significan tly declined (P<0.05) in SY, EO and SYEO groups (2.33, 2 and 4.33 respectively) in comparison with the NE group (6.67). Insignificant difference was recorded between cum. scoring of intestine (P>0.05) in ABAC group (1.67), SY and EO groups (Table 4). The cum. litter score of treated groups was significantly declined in all treatments (0 for all, except SY group scored 0.33) (P<0.05) in comparison with the CO and NE groups (1 and 1.67). The cumulative oocyst count was significantly increased i n CO and NE group (3.7\u00d7104 and 3.0\u00d7104 respectively) (P<0.05) in comparison with the CN group (44.45). On the other hand, there was significant decline in the cum. shedding reported in SY, EO and SYEO groups (1.40\u00d7104, 1.4\u00d7104 and 1.7\u00d7104 respectively) i n comparison with NE group (P<0.05). Expectedly the lowest cum. count recorded in ABAC group (633.33) which was significant decline (P<0.05) in comparison with other treatments and +ve controls. 3.3 Histopathological findings: The histopathological changes in intestine and liver of euthanized birds were listed in table 5 and plate 4 The NE group showed moderate to very sever histopathological changes in different intestinal sections and scored 10 in the cum. scoring of intestine. Also it showed significant increase in cum. coccidial infection (6) in comparison with the CN group which showed normal histological Effect of Synbiotics and Essential Oils in Ameliorating the Negative Drawbacks of Necrotic Enteritis an d Coccidiosis (P<0.05). The EO, SY and SYEO groups recorded low cum. intestinal scoring (7, 8 and 9 r espectively) in comparison to NE group (10) as well as significant low cum. infection by coccidia (1, 2.33 and 2 respectively) in comparison with both CO and NE group (6). As predictable the ABAC group recorded the lowest cum. infection and histopathologic al changes (1 and 6) in comparison with NE group, but this decline was insignificant in comparison with synbiotic and EO groups (P>0.05). The EO, SY and ABAC groups showed mild (1) histopathological changes in liver in comparison with NE group which showed sever lesions (3).

DISCUSSION The use of dietary additives as synbiotics and essential oils are gaining momentum and paid an attention to be used as alternatives to antibiotics and anticoccidial drugs to prevent NE and coccidiosis in broilers. In this study, Cp challenged broilers fed essential oils of oregano, anise, and citr us peel alone or in combination with synbiotic for 35 days has resulted numerical increase in BW in comparison with the NE group; while, synbiotic did not enhance the BW in comparison with the +ve control group. These results come along with those of Jer zsele et al., (2012) who found that using essential oils improved the performance of challenged broilers contrary to probiotics which did not. The EO were found to improve the taste and feed palatability, stimulate the secretion of bile, mucus and saliva a nd improve the digestive enzymes activities (Alloui et al ., 2014). The Cp challenged birds showed increase in gross lesions on different parts of the small intestine and livers as well as increases the cfu of Cp in jejunum in comparison with the negative control group. Using synbiotic, essential oils and their combination in diets of Cp challenged broilers were very efficacious in reducing the severity of lesions in the small intestine and livers as well as the Cp count. Interestingly, chlortetracycline HC L/diclazuril treated group recorded insignificance (P>0.05) in values of scoring and microbiological count in comparison with the used biological treatments. These findings agreed with McReynolds et al ., (2009) who reported that multistrain probiotic or es sential oils in feed or water of Cp challenged broilers reduce lesion scoring and Cp count. S. cerevisiae and its cell wall extract were found to increase intestinal IgA production which binds to C. perfringens -toxin and prevent their passage through t he mucosal membrane hence, no infection establishment and lesions in intestine (Kulkarni et al ., 2010). EO can stimulate digestive enzymes as trypsin which inactivates the -toxin of Cp type A and the - toxin of Cp type C (Baba et al., 1992). The synbioti cs, EO and their combination reduced lesion, litter and dropping scorings as well as oocyst shedding in challenged birds in comparison with the non-treated challenged groups. Birds receiving diclazuril in diet showed lower oocyst shedding than other treatm ents, but insignificant differences were recorded in other parameters in comparison with them. Similarly, using Lactobacillus spp. and /or MOS as well as EO reduced lesion scoring in challenged broilers with mixed Eimeria spp. (Bozkurt et al., 2014). The probiotic microorganisms can reduce the epithelial invasion by intracellular coccidia; hence decrease their multiplication and shedding (Abdelrahman et al ., 2014). Moreover, presence of EO phenol compounds in EO disturb cellular ion balance, whi ch results in cell membrane collapse and stop ATP synthesis in coccidian cell (Ultee et al., 1999). The recorded count of oocyst shedding in CN group can be attributed to uptake of oocysts from the surrounding environment as birds were kept on deep litter system. Regarding to the recorded improvements in histopathological scoring and coccidial infection of synbiotic and EO treated birds, Al-Baadani et al ., (2016) reported that supplementing Cp challenged broiler chicks with probiotics, prebiotics and synbi otics improved intestinal histopathological score and histomorEOometric criteria. Moreover, using essential oils in diets of broilers had significantly improved intestinal histopathological scores in challenged birds (Jerzsele et al., 2012). 5. Conclusio n According to our results, synbiotics and essential oils can be potential candidates as alternatives to antibacterial and anti coccidial Marwa et al. (2019). BVMJ -36(2): 187-198 811 drugs in poultry rations. As they ameliorated the negative drawbacks of necrotic enteritis and coccidiosis in broiler chickens by promoting better intestinal health. In addition, their using in diets will reduce the hazards associated with the antibiotic feed additives on both bird and human health. 6.
