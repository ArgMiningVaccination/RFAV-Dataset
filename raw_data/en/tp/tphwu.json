India ranks 9th position on foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in 2016, as per World Investment Report 2017. \u00b7 India's ranking in World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index has made giant leap of 30 positions - from 130 in 2016 to 100 in 2017 (as per World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report, 2018) \u00b7 India has established itself as one of the top 10 inbound investment destinations in the world. One of the key reasons is India opening up its sectors for FDI. \u00b7 India is one of the most open economies of the world when it comes to sectors opened up for FDI \u00b7 Due to its investment friendly policies and opening up of FDI sectors, India for the first time received FDI of more than USD 50 billion in FY 2015-16; the exact figure being USD 55.45 billion and highest ever FDI inflow of USD 60.08 billion in 2016-17. \u00b7 FDI has shown an extremely positive trend since the launch of Make in India Week with growth of 56 percent on FDI inflow and 68 percent on FDI Equity inflows, since the launch of the initiative over the corresponding period previous to it. \u00b7 Highest FDI inflow for the last 3 financial years (USD 160.7 billion) - 32% of cumulative FDI inflow over past 17 financial years (USD 484 billion) | | Particular | | October 2010 -March 2014 (USD Bn.) | | April 2014 - September 2017 (USD Bn.) | | Growth | | FDI Equity Inflow | | 92.22 | | 139.76 | | 52% FDI has also increased constantly over the past three financial years i.e. FY 2014-15, FY 2015-16, FY | Bn.) | FDI Inflow | | 45.15 | | 55.45 | | 60 | | 48.2 | | FDI Equity Inflow | | 31 | | 40 | | 43.5 | | 35.94 The Govt. of India has also increased autonomy in the FDI inflows. The key measure for this is the increase in FDI via the Automatic Route (for which one does not require Govt. permission to invest) vis-a-vis the Govt. Route. | | Period | | FDI inflow via automatic route (share in %) | | FDI inflow via Govt. route (share in %) | | 2000 - 01 | | 20 | | 80 | | 2001 - 02 | | 20 | | 80 | | 2002 - 03 | | 28 | | 72 | | 2003 - 04 | | 24 | | 86 | | 2004 - 05 | | 41 | | 59 | | 2005 - 06 | | 59 | | 41 | | 2006 - 07 | | 82 | | 18 | | 2007 - 08 | | 87 | | 13 | | 2008 - 09 | | 85 | | 15 | | 2009 - 2010 | | 87 | | 13 | | 2010 - 2011 | | 91 | | 9 | | 2011 - 2012 | | 91 | | 9 | | 2012 - 2013 | | 87 | | 13 | | 2013 - 2014 | | 95 | | 5 | | 2014 - 2015 | | 93 | | 7 | | 2015 - 2016 | | 91 | | 9 FDI in India has been opened in many key sectors such as - Defence Manufacturing, Food Processing, Telecommunications, Agriculture, Pharmaceuticals, Civil Aviation, Space, Private Security Agencies, Railways, Insurance and Pensions, Medical Devices and Pensions.

It is the first platform in India for knowledge on regulatory compliance requirements across States. \u00b7 In 2016, DIPP released the 340-point Business Reform Action Plan which includes recommendations for reforms on 58 regulatory processes, policies, practices or procedures spread across 10 reform areas spanning the lifecycle of a typical business. A total of 6,069 reforms were approved as implemented or not applicable on the portal \u00b7 States/UTs worked very hard and showed tremendous competition. 12 States scored more than 90% implementation score in 2017, DIPP has identified a total of 372 reforms across 12 broad parameters covering: Labour enablers, Contract enforcement, Registering property, Inspection enablers, Single window system, Land availability and allotment, Construction permit enablers, Environment registration enablers, obtaining utility, paying taxes, access to information and transparency, sector specific. \u00b7 For the first time, sector specific reforms related to healthcare and hospitality have been included.

A score will be given to each State/UT based on the feedback collected. Overall ranking of the State/UT will be determined based on the combined score of implementation score and feedback score. DIPP has also released a note on Feedback Survey Methodology. It is also available on DIPP's website. \u00b7 To help the low scoring States, leader States have been requested to help and guide them in the implementation the reforms and share the best practices across reforms.

Pension Policy improvements \u00b7 Implementation of recommendations of 7th CPC for pensioners: Orders were issued on 04.08.2016 for regulating pensionary benefits of employees retired/retiring on or after 01.01.2016. \u00b7 The minimum pension has been increased from Rs. 3500/- p.m. to Rs. 9,000/- per month. \u00b7 The minimum disability pension and family pension covered under CCS(EOP)Rules of a Government servant/family of the deceased Government holding a pensionable post has been enhanced to Rs. 18,000/- per month vide OM No.1/4/2016-P&PW(F) dated 2-8-2017 \u00b7 The ceiling of Retirement and Death gratuity has been increased from the existing Rs.10 lakh to Rs.20 lakhs. \u00b7 With effect from 1.1.2016, the rates of ex-gratia lump sum compensation being paid to the families of employees who die in performance of duty has been increased from Rs. 10-15 lakhs to Rs.25-45 lakhs; \u00b7 The Constant Attendant Allowance being paid to pensioners drawing disability pension has been increased from the existing Rs.4500/- p.m to Rs.6750/- p.m, vide OM No.1/4/2017-P&PW(F) dated 2/8/2017 \u00b7 Amount of Fixed Medical Allowance payable to the Central Government Pensioners residing in areas not covered under CGHS has been increased from Rs. 500/- per month to Rs. 1000/- per month w.e.f. 01.07.2017. \u00b7 Orders have been issued on 26.08.2016 for extension of benefit of gratuity to NPS employees, on the same terms as applicable to employees appointed before 01.01.2004. \u00b7 Based on 7th CPC recommendations separate order have been issued on 12.05.2017 for revision of pension of pre-2016 pensioners/family pensioners w.e.f. 1.1.2016 by notional pay fixation. This has brought the pension of past pensioners at par with that of the employees retiring on or after 1.1.2016. \u00b7 Concordance tables for fixation of notional pay and pension/family pension of employees who retired/died in various grades during the 4th, 5th and 6th Pay Commission periods have been issued vide this Department's OM No. 38/37/2016-P&PW(A) dated 6th July, 2017. \u00b7 Earlier, only 1/3rd of pension was being restored after 15 years in the case of employees who got absorbed in PSUs, etc. and had taken 100% lump-sum amount in lieu of pension. Orders have been issued on 23rd June, 2017 and 21st July, 2017 allowing restoration of full pension after expiry of commutation period of 15 years to all such absorbee pensioners. 2. Simplification of pension claim procedure \u00b7 Procedure for sanction of Pension has been simplified. Time taken in processing of pension papers has been reduced from two years to one year. \u00b7 Earlier, a retired Government servant had to approach his pension disbursing bank for collecting his Pension Payment Order. The procedures have been simplified to enable handing over of the PPO on retirement from the office where the Government servant last served. \u00b7 Requirement of affidavits/attestations by Gazetted officers has been dispensed with. \u00b7 On death of a Government employee/pensioner, dependent parents and disabled child/sibling are eligible to receive family pension. Since a fresh PPO was required to be issued in their favour, they had to face a lot of difficulty in getting family pension started. The rules have been amended to allow co-authorization of disabled children/siblings and dependent parents in the PPO issued to the retiring employee. This would enable the Bank to start family pension to them without the need for a fresh PPO from the pension sanctioning authority. \u00b7 Earlier, divorced daughter was eligible for family pension if the divorce took place during the lifetime of the parents in receipt of pension/family pension. Orders have been issued on 19th July, 2017 stating that the Family Pension to divorced daughter would be allowed even in such cases where divorce proceedings had been filed during the life time of employee/pensioner or his/her spouse but divorce took place after their death. \u00b7 In order to claim the Fixed Medical Allowance, the retired Government employees residing in cities/areas not covered under CGHS were required to submit a certificate from the CMO/CGHS to the effect that their residence was not covered by CGHS. The requirement of this certificate has now been dispensed with for sanctioning Fixed Medical Allowance (FMA) to pensioners. 3. Liberalization and simplification of GPF (CS) Rules, 1960 \u00b7 Provisions for grant of withdrawal and advances have been simplified by allowing simple declaration by the subscriber. No further documentary evidence will be required. \u00b7 Limits for withdrawals have been raised and procedures simplified especially for activities of house building and education of children, where the costs have gone up manifold over the last two decades. \u00b7 Scope has been widened to include primary, secondary and higher education covering all streams and institutions, advance can be taken for travel and tourism also. \u00b7 Maximum time limit of 15 days prescribed for sanction and payment of advance/withdrawal. 4. Initiatives towards Digitization & Reform \u00b7 Pensioners' Portal: Pensioners' Portal is a web-based single platform created in 2007 with the objective to disseminate pension related information, as well as to provide redressal of the pensioners' grievances at a single point. In the last four years the Portal was strengthened by adding the facility of online pension sanction process and experience sharing platform of central government retirees. It also provides the facility of self-assessment of Pensionary dues by the online pension calculator, latest updated orders, personalized road-map for retirees. In September 2017, a mobile app of the department was launched to reach out to a larger number of pensioners and the services of the Pensioners Portal was made available through this App. \u00b7 Digital Life Certificate (DLC) implementation initiative: To ease the life certification process, DeitY has developed an on-line life certificate submission system which is based on Aadhar number. In order to ensure smooth implementation of the DLC method of submitting Life Certificate, this Department organized a tripartite coordination between UIDAI, Jeevan Pramaan team of MeitY and Banks. This Department is also promoting use of submission of Digital Life Certificate among the pensioners so that they can submit life certificate from anywhere without waiting in long queue in banks. Till date 93% of pensioners accounts have been seeded with Aadhar number which enables them to avail the digital life certificate in future. \u00b7 E-Office implementation: The Department of Pensions & Pensioners' Welfare went completely paperless and 100% files are now on e-office. These efforts were recognised in an Award ceremony organised by the DARPG which is the coordinating department for e-office . \u00b7 CPENGRAMS: is web-based grievance redressal and monitoring system. It facilitates pensioners to register their grievance online and view the progress till disposal of their case through system. In the last four years the system achieved rising popularity which indicates the building of confidence in the system. The number of grievances registered during the last three years and disposed of during the same period are: | | A | | B | | C | | D | | E | | F | | Year | | B/F | | Received during the year as on 31.3.18 | | Total (A+B) | | Disposed during the year | | Pending at the close of the year | | 2014-15 | | 6234 | | 11787 | | 18021 | | 14349 (79.62%) | | 3672 | | 2015-16 | | 3672 | | 18509 | | 22181 | | 19885(89.64%) | | 2296 | | 2016-17 | | 2296 | | 31007 | | 33303 | | 30019(90.13%) | | 3284 | | 2017-18 | | 3284 | | 34491 | | 37775 | | 34865(92.29%) | | 2910 The average time taken for disposal of grievances in 2014 was 104 days which was brought down to 36 in 2017. The last four years average disposal time is given below: | | Year | | Average time in which grievance was disposed | | 2014 | | 104 | | 2015 | | 55 | | 2016 | | 44 | | 2017 | | 36 \u00b7 Deep Dive Analysis of grievances for delivering quality disposal: Initiatives have also been introduced to strengthen the quality in grievance disposal. The department conducted a Root Cause Analysis of the grievances received and identified Focus Ministries as well as kinds of grievances in order to target the reforms in the right direction. \u00b7 All Ministries combined Pension Adalats: Further, to strengthen the grievances redressal mechanism this department launched the new initiative of Pension Adalat wherein unresolved grievances in CPENGRAMS are listed and the petitioner along with the concerned Ministry/Department, Banks, CPAO etc. are brought at one common platform with an objective to provide on the spot resolution of grievance. a. In the first Pension Adalat under the auspices of the Hon'ble MoS(PP) was conducted in September 2017, out of 29 grievances, 26 cases were resolved on the spot. b. The second Pension Adalat was organized on February 9, 2018, again under the auspices of MOS (PP) wherein 31 cases were disposed of on-the-spot in a single sitting covering grievances of Pensioners from 17 Ministries/Departments. \u00b7 BHAVISHYA: It was observed that 25% of the grievances are due to delay in initiation in pension. To make the pension sanction process transparent an online pension sanction module 'Bhavishya' was developed. In the first phase Bhavishya was implemented in the main secretariats of Ministries in 2015 and after its successful implementation it was made mandatory for all the Central Govt. Ministries/Departments w.e.f. 01.01.2017. This digitization has gone a long way in ensuring seamless and accurate Pension processing for all the Central Govt Employees on the system. It has had the following results: \u00fc There is complete transparency in processing a Pension case and the retiree keeps getting regular updates about the stage of his Pension processing; \u00fc The system is capable of giving real-time data of pension processing right up to the stage of first credit of pension into the account of the Pensioner; \u00fc The system has made the concept of e-PPO possible and based on the Bhavishya e-PPO was launched on 1st March, 2017. It is a landmark in digitization of Pension processing. \u00fc As of now 35523 cases have been processed through Bhavishya. \u00fc As of now 458 offices with 6508 DDOs of civil ministries/departments are on the board of Bhavishya processing 26,117 pension cases of government employees. 5. Awareness campaigns for Pensioners and Officials dealing with pension cases: To reduce the pensioners grievances, which are approximately, 2500 per month, Department of Pension& PW organized the following: \u00b7 Pre-retirement Counselling: It is observed that pension grievances arise due to ignorance of updated rule position amongst dealing staff or unawareness of their entitlement procedures for claim amongst the retirees/pensioners. To address the above issue this department started conducting Pre-Retirement Counselling for the retirees, specially those of CAPFs living in far-flung areas, deployed at the frontiers including Shillong, Jaisalmer etc. \u00b7 Training of Trainers workshops: 11 Training of Trainers workshops were conducted and a pool of 670 Master trainers was created. \u00b7 Pensioners' Awareness camps: For the benefit of pensioners, awareness Shillong, Aizwal, Kohima, Guwhati, Jodhpur, Jaipur and on updated entitlements of pensioners/family pensioners. \u00b7 Training to Dealing staff w.r.t. pension cases of Ministries/ Department: A total number of 543 officials from all Ministries/Departments were trained on latest Rules/Regulations for Pension settlement, specially issues arising out of Family Pension and Disability Pension. \u00b7 Awareness through Print Media: To reach out to the pensioners, especially family pensioners, in far flung regions of the country, the Department brought out an Information bulletin in 159 newspapers including national and regional newspapers covering all states and UTs. This bulletin was on useful and updated provisions on pension related entitlements and about CPENGRAM. \u00b7 Awareness through Visual Media: The department made extensive use of Radio and Television to spread awareness among Pensioners about Life Certificate and DLCs.
