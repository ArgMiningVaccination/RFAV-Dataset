Linn DO.MP (CAN) Motion is inherent to life and represents the free expression of health as it is reflected in our physical, emotional and energetic body. Motion must be present both in the Structure and Function that animates and ambulates our physical form, but also with-in the smallest recesses, the spaces between organs, lungs, vessels and neural sheaths, membranes and fascial connections that provide shape and form, and make our entire body whole and interconnected. When the free motion of any of the human bodies structures are lost or inhibited, whether by infection, injury or prolonged states of emotional overwhelm, we begin the process of adaptation and compensation, and from this point, we are vulnerable or subject to the development of dysfunction and disease processes. Trained in the Traditional Principles of Osteopathy, Seth Linn brings a diverse background of Functional, Preventative and Manipulative Medicine skills to the Clear Center. Having training directly under the supervision of Gary F. Gordon MD/DO, a world-renowned leader in Chelation therapy, Longevity and Preventive Medicine, Seth learned first hand the reflective and interactive relationships that support that premise that \"Structure governs Function\" and \"the role of the artery is supreme\". Observing this relationship in action, Seth specializes in the normalization of Structural disorders, Visceral restrictions and Fluidic patterns of dysfunction that inhibit health. The Normalization of these key systems helps the body fully express health, and make better use of the medications, nutrition or lifestyle changes prescribed by affiliate care providers, thereby amplifying the positive effects of both Allopathic, Naturopathic and Integrative Medicine models of care. Traditional Osteopathy Favors using a hands-on approach to access and understand dysfunction, normalize function and restore health. A complete and Holistic approach to Healthcare must consider all aspects of human physiology and human potential. Having a thorough understanding Anatomy, Physiology and the Biomechanics of how the human body moves and how motion interrelates to health, gives Osteopaths a cutting-edge in finding and correcting the primary source of dysfunction and supporting the process of the restoration of health. Using the human hand as a corrective tool, Osteopath's can utilize direct Manual Medicine principles and techniques to correct and restore the physiological and mechanical potential of the body, which in turn serves to auto-regulate and potentialize the process of health and healing. Osteopathy does not stop at treating the physical structures of the body. A key component of Osteopathy is the ability to interface with the fascia, connective tissues, viscera, organs and the brain, integrating emotional, hormonal and biological health. Waking these vitality centers of the patient's body positively alters patterns that may otherwise attract ill-health. Cranial Osteopathy, also referred to as Cranio-Sacral Therapy, plays an integral part of ensuring that the strongest component of health, the Primary Respiratory Mechanism, as well as the individual's \"sense of self \" is present once the structure and function of the body, organs, blood-flow, neurology and elimination pathways are all working. Without this vitality and the presence of the human spirit to animate our expression of health, the body operates simply as an unconscious biological mechanism that fails to represent our full human potential. The goal of Osteopathic treatment is to improve human health in all areas of body, mind and spirit. In healthcare, what is often the missing link in holding onto \"health\" is a clear definition of what health truly is. This is a very individualized experience that must extend beyond the absence of pain and disease. It must also share a universality that includes a sense of inherent joy, trust, faith, courage, hope, desire and a deeply held belief of being free to live one's life fully, with love, free expression and a sense of well-being\". \"Applying principles of traditional Osteopathy as a tool in altering the course of health VS disease is not the end of the road in how healthcare is delivered. The re-organization of the integrative processes of organic life only hints at our true being's potential expression of life. I like to consider my role in the largest aspect of influencing body, mind and spirit to thrive, not just survive. Intervening in, and restoring the sense of peace that ensures the free expression of human health, opens doors that are so far reaching that only the individual can express the profound changes that unfolds from experiencing a body that has released burden and has unleashed its full free expression to live life fully\". Education Graduate of the Coll\u00e8ge d'\u00c9tudes Ost\u00e9opathiques, Montreal Qc. Traditional Non-Physician Osteopath. DO.MP (CAN) Summary Over the course of 11 years, I practiced as an Osteopathic Physician Aide under the direct supervision of Dr.'s Gordon D.O., M.D., Carbone D.O., Patterson D.O. and ultimately, Dr. Gary Gramm D.O., the Executive Director and past President of the Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons of California. Under the exclusive direction of these four Osteopathic Physicians, I developed my manual skills and gained extensive clinical knowledge in the field of Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Rehabilitation and how it can be best applied in conjunction with primary care Medicine. In 2003, I pursued my Osteopathic degree with the Canadian College of Osteopathy and graduated with Honors from the Coll\u00e8ge d'\u00c9tudes Ost\u00e9opathiques, Montreal QC. In preparation for entry into formal Osteopathic studies, I completed 115 hours of advanced Cranial Protocol under Alain Gehin, author of the \"Atlas of Manipulative Technique for the Cranium and Face\", furthering my understanding of complex cranial and neurological disorders stemming from the brain and spinal cord. In 2005 I completed Pediatrics training with Viola Frymann D.O., an Icon and innovator in the field of Pediatric care and early childhood development. Additional training provided by Robert Rouse D.O., addressed Functional Emergency Treatments, while specific Osteopathic Technique rounded the core of my Osteopathic training. Encompassing over 2350 individual manipulative techniques, I have been trained to understand semiology and differential diagnosis, addressing the interactive aspects of structure and function, as well as the neurological and fluidic balance essential for auto-regulation and the restoration of health. Advanced Anatomy, Physiology Embryology and global concepts in Osteopathic Philosophy were obtained in 36, 40 hour class modules provided under the direction of Philippe Druelle D.O., founder and CEO of the 6 Traditional Osteopathic Colleges located in Canada and Europe. Since completion of the core 5-year program in April of 2008, I invested 3 years into completing a clinical thesis, studying the effects of Osteopathic Manipulation on symptoms of Pudendal Nerve Entrapment (PNE), a painful and disabling pelvic pain syndrome effecting both men and women. Following the successful defense of my thesis in June of 2011, I have continued post-graduate studies, placing emphasis on better understanding endo-cranial spasms and trans-generational lesions, long considered a potential source of deep seated patterns of emotional, spiritual, neurological and vegetative dysfunction.
