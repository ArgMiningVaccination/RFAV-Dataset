One can keep the right balance within the immune system by following a diet that consists of the right food items. - Immunity boosting spices It is very important you cook with ingredients that do not hinder the food's natural properties. For instance, the use of spices in your food wil not only enhance the taste of your food but also improve your digestion. Moreover, several spices have immunity-boosting properties that are highly beneficial in the long run. For example, Turmeric (Haldi) has detoxifying properties and also positively impacts the overall intelligence of the immune cells. Medicinal herbs such as ginger, garlic, olive leaf, amla, etc, help your body tackle bacteria that affects your immune system. - Detox According to Ayurveda, one of the main reasons why diseases develop is Ama (toxins in undigested food). The formation of Ama and indigestion restrict the nutrients from reaching the tissues and thus in return weakens the immune system. Hence, it is vital to detox after you intake unhealthy food to ensure you get rid of the toxins. We assure you that if you follow a disciplined diet in sync with values imparted by Ayurveda, the harmful toxins in your body will flush out. Increase the intake of organic food as they are chemcial-free and also consist of important minerals - Sleep For your immune system to thrive, apart from focussing on your diet, it is also essential to sleep adequately. Good sleep helps the human immune system to let out proteins named cytokines that also influence sleep. In addition, it is important to understand that a balanced sleep cycle also helps in the regeneration of the immune cells effectively. - Pranayama If your life is highly stressful, it will hinder your immunity. Hence, if your life is marred with stress, it is advisable for your to start Nadi Shodhana (alternate nostril breathing). The crucial breath (Prana) revitalizes each cell and tissue of our body. In addition, Prana relieves the tension that has been accumulated and also helps the nervous system.
