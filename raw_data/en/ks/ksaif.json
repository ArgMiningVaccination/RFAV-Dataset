In doing so, we begin to realize the body is more than a physical shell ... we're proposing acceptance of an approach that perceives the body as a component in a holistic approach to self-healing. We're committing ourselves to seeing our bodies in a new light - one that accepts our innate ability to release subtle healing energy when necessary ... this is not to dismiss the doubts surrounding certain practices. It is also not trivializing mainstream or conventional medicine. What we propose when regarding energy work is that we all keep an open mind. Homeopathy, for example, is accepted in several countries where once it was ignored. Nursing professionals and their organization recognize Healing Touch (HT) as being effective. Moreover, I suggest the two types of medical approaches should work together to ensure we live life as we should. There are many new choices in natural healing available for people who don't want to follow the traditional medical healing practices? There are several types of alternative healing practices that one can follow depending on the nature of their problem. Natural healing is categorized under alternative medicine, and some of these practices date back to thousands of years. There are several popular forms of natural healing, such as meditation, magnetic healing, acupuncture, shiatsu, ayurveda, reiki, aromatherapy, and herbalism, among others. Energy work , healing energy, energy therapy and energy medicine are all found under the title, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). It is a healthy choice with significant evidence of its benefits. Energy work is holistic in nature. This means it addresses the body as a whole. In examining a patient, the practitioner will look at all the physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual aspects that comprise it. This is typical of most forms of CAM. The focal point of treatment is not a specific organ or body part. In alternative energy healing work, the major concern is energy. This energy, practitioners believe, comprises the make-up of the body. The Chi, or life force, determines whether the body remains healthy on all levels. Energy Work - someone trained in the particular technique of energy systems does the best energy work. A spiritual healer , a Reiki Master or an acupuncture or acupressure specialist is best qualified to treat a client in their form of energy medicine. Therefore, do not only select the most suitable form of energy work, but also someone who has been trained properly in the field. Beyond their knowledge and training, look especially their awareness and conduct! Do your research on both the practice and the practitioner before you decide which will suit your needs best there are several different types of energy work from which to choose.You may prefer Therapeutic Touch (TT). Someone else may like Qigong or Quantum Touch (QT).Spiritual Healing includes also energy work and more. There are also other forms. They include: - Acupuncture/acupressure - Yoga meditation - Pranic Healing - Meditation - Restorative Touch - Polarity Therapy - Healing Touch - Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) - Energy Focused Bodywork While practitioners may employ different approaches, the overall purpose is to balance the energy within the body . This energy goes by different names. It is our life-force energy, Chi (Qi), Bioenergy or Prana. This energy flows along channels or meridians - depending upon the system. In Reiki, there are seven energy centers, or Chakras. The practitioner sees where the energy is blocked. He or she may perceive an imbalance. The next move is to remove the blockage and/or balance the energy. When the energy flows freely and is in balance with the body, the body will be healthy at all levels. The human body is an energy system ... imbalance on any level will ultimately manifest itself into the physical... \"If we believe our bodies can heal themselves, the answer is also yes. If we believe that someone, including ourselves, can help direct the energy to abet the healing process, then, undoubtedly, energy work works. Energy healing is energy medicine or energy therapy. It's an emerging form of complementary and alternative medicine. It's not a modern concept or approach. The origins are found throughout the ancient world. This form of healing is noted in Christianity, as well as other Western and Eastern religions. Energy work was part of many early approaches to medicine. Early medical practitioners believed that when the energy within the body was out of balance, people became ill. In Asian countries, medical people felt the only way to a healthy body lay in correcting this imbalance. China and Japan, for example, developed a medical system based upon energy levels within the body. Yet, the belief in the role of energy is not restricted to the physical. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners have always perceived this energy (Chi), as having a holistic impact. In other words, the quality and amount of energy found circulating within your body affects your emotional, psychological and spiritual well-being. It is not restricted to your physical health. In its different forms, energy healing is defined as an aspect of alternative and complementary medicine. Energy medicine employs diverse methods to modify and manipulate the flow of energy within the body. The intent is to realign, replenish or stabilize the amount and the quality of energy within the human body. Today we can draw upon the skill of various schools. The list has been expanding. Below, a list of just some of the better-known schools or approaches: - Reiki - Qigong - Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT or FTT) - Biofield energy - Therapeutic Touch (TT) - Spiritual Healing - generally secular or at least non-denominational - Faith Healing - tends to be Christian-based - Acupuncture/acupressure - Yoga - Sufi dancing - Polarity Therapy - Feldenkreis work - Meditation - certain forms - Visualization techniques - Chakra balancing Energy work is based also relies on the client belief in the ability of the practitioner to channel energy into him or her. TCM and other forms of physical, mental and spiritual healing hold that the practitioner is able to add or subtract energy in the body's channels (meridians). In doing so, energy comes back into balance. The use of energy to restore health - physical, mental and spiritual, is a component of alternative and complementary medicine. Practitioners can utilize many different approaches. Yet, the purpose is the same - to heal by channelling the energy from one individual into another. This will reduce or increase the levels within to achieve a balance. Scientific research still questions the ability of energy work to heal. Nevertheless, some methods, such as Reiki and TT are accepted as viable in many modern medical practices. There is a increasing amount of alternative medical practices available and sometimes it's hard to keep them all straight. Many people seek holistic and natural approaches to treat injuries, stress and chronic pain, and find the treatments successful and side-effect-free. These treatments draw on fine tuned ancient practices and not only look at the whole body, but sometimes at the wellbeing of the mind. That said, there are a lot of charlatans out there as well, so look out and check thoroughly. This guide will help you understand some of the safest emerging practices.
