What is colon cleansing? Colon cleansing dates back to ancient times. It's recently become popular. But is it safe for you? Your colon is also known as your large intestine or large bowel. Part of your [digestive system](https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm) breaks down food and moves waste to your rectum. Colon cleansing is usually done to prepare for medical procedures such as a [colonoscopy](https://www.medicinenet.com/colonoscopy/article.htm). But some alternative medicine practitioners say that colon cleansing can detoxify your body. - Colon cleansing can be done using colon-cleansing products or colonic irrigation (colonic hydrotherapy). - In colonic irrigation, up to 60 liters of fluid is pumped through your rectum via a tube. This is repeated several times. This is not like an enema, which runs a much smaller amount of fluid one time into your colon. - A colon cleanse is also not the same as a colonoscopy. During a colonoscopy, your doctor examines your colon to check for abnormalities, and screens for colon [cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm). A long, flexible tube called a [colonoscope](https://www.medicinenet.com/colorectal_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm)is inserted into your rectum. This contains a tiny camera so your doctor can see the inside of your colon.
