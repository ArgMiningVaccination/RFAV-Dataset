Even the simplest and most holistic routines can expose you to common pollutants. From the water that you drink to the air that you breath, toxins are everywhere. Your body can do some of the work of removal, but even a healthy body can't remove all of the toxins you encounter on a daily basis. Toxins In Your Body The toxins that you find in your body can be found in a number of places. For example, the World Health Organization tracks air pollution and found that the levels of pollution had risen 8% in five years. Other toxins can include pesticides which are commonly found in the foods that we eat. The WHO monitors food and water for toxin content and has found that the majority of foods that we consume are high in toxins. One of the highest concentration is found in glycophosphates which are used for pesticides. They're also used in parks, playgrounds, and other places just to kill weeds though so you can be exposed even without eating foods that contain pesticides. Other toxins may be absorbed through your skin. Personal care products such as make-up, performs, and shampoos can contain parabens, phenoxyethanol which are used to stabilize or extend the life of some products. When you use these products, they can be absorbed through your skin. Over time, you may not be able to manage the toxins that are present. Your Body's Natural Toxin Removal If you're concerned about the high level of toxins in the environment, you should know that your body has a natural system to handle toxins in the environment. One key way that they start eliminating toxins is through your lungs. The lungs contain fibers known as cilia that push out contaminants. The other systems in your body that handle toxins are the liver, colon, and kidneys. The colon or large intestine absorbs nutrients from food and then gets rid of waste so it will eliminate some toxins from your foods. The liver is also a toxin-fighting machine. It filters blood to get rid of potentially harmful substances. Since all blood flows through the liver, this organ plays an essential process. Finally. The kidneys filter blood as well and can eliminate some toxins through your urine. Removing Toxins in Your Body In some cases, your body can do some additional work if you try to eliminate toxins from being absorbed. You'd be amazed at the difference you can experience from just making diet and lifestyle changes. If you're just getting started on your detoxification journey, then these are some of the most effective lifestyle changes you can make Diet Diet- in general, you should eat foods that are high in nutrients and low in processed ingredients and harmful chemicals. Try to restrict dairy, red meat, processed foods, alcohol, caffeine, and inorganic produce. Instead, turn to organic fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and [small beans](/blogs/health/healthy-legumes-for-weight-loss). Be sure to use herbs and spices in your cooking as well. Stay Hydrated Since your kidneys plan an essential role in removing toxins, give them a boost by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Adequate fluid intake will help them to naturally filter out toxins. Exercise Just like your body gets rid of toxins through the lungs, you can also reduce them through healthy exercise. Aim for [30 minutes](/blogs/blog/compound_exercsies) of moderate exercise most days of the week for the best results. Take Supplements Some supplements and nutrients can help to reduce or eliminate toxins in your body. Consider having a holistic regimen to support this as well. Fasting Some studies have shown that intermittent fasting can help to reduce inflammation and may help your body heal itself. Although this may not work for everyone, consider intermittent fasting when you can to improve this. Focus on Sleep When you sleep, your body produces melatonin, a compound that assists with detoxification. If you have a melatonin deficiency, you may run into problems and compromise your immune system.

When thinking about the natural processes in your body, you may be wondering if you really need to detox. The simplest answer is yes! Of course your body does a great job of managing toxins but it can't eliminate them all completely. Unfortunately, the toxic compounds that we come across all day, every day, are too much for our bodies to handle on their own. Your systems can reduce some toxic substances but it's still possible to have an overload. You may notice some symptoms of toxin overload in your body. Impaired function is one of the key symptoms. People who have too many toxins in their system may have difficulty sleeping, memory problems, and other inflammatory conditions. There isn't one key symptom of this problem, but it's very common in society today. How Often to Detox? When it comes to detoxing, there are two parts of this. The first is detox supplements. When it comes to supplements for detoxing, this is an area where you can focus every day. Some supplements can be take on a daily basis while others should only be taken periodically. It's always best to look at the dosing form for every supplement and follow the directions on the supplement. However, many detox supplements are taken on a daily basis. The rationale for this is that your body is always exposed to toxins so the process of detoxing is ongoing. Another type of detoxing is going on a detox diet. Although a diet that focuses on detoxing is a good option, you probably aren't going to follow this type of diet at all times. Doing a full cleanse where you do a full restriction probably shouldn't be done more than a few times a year. There are also some times when you may not want to do a detox or want to be very cautious. For example, if you're pregnant or going through a severe illness, it may be best to be cautious or avoid detoxing at this time. Some detox programs are handy to be used periodically and many people use them every few months. They find that this hard reset is a great way to find their center again and start off on a good food. Once going on a detox cleanse, you'll often find that your body starts to feel better and it's easier to stick with healthier, unprocessed foods in general. Even after a detox cleanse, you can continue with your detoxing efforts by focusing on a diet that supports your body's normal cleansing process. FAQs What Do I Eat During a Detox? If you're going on a detox, some people do a cleanse which may contains foods or just be a combination of liquid diet and supplements. You don't necessarily need a juice cleanse for a detox. Instead, you should focus on eating a diet that eliminates high sugar foods, sugary beverages, red meat, processed foods, caffeine, and dairy. Your detox can be as light or extreme as you wish so some people do prefer to do the [juice cleanses](/blogs/recipes/detox_smoothie_recipies). Does Apple Cider Vinegar Help You Lose Weight? Although apple cider vinegar can aid in weight loss, you should also combine this supplement with a healthy diet and lifestyle. Make sure that you're watching the foods that you eat in addition to taking this supplement for the best results. However, if your goal is weight loss, you can support healthy weight loss with the addition of apple cider vinegar. Does Lemon Water Cleanse the Liver? Lemon water can help stimulate the liver to flush out toxins but it's probably not going to be most effective when used entirely on its own. It's best to drink lemon water for a refreshing beverage throughout the day or first thing in the [morning](/blogs/recipes/lemon-ginger-detox) but you should also use this regimen along with an entire detox regimen for the best results. Can You Eat Fruit on a Sugar Detox? While fruit contains natural sugar, it still contains sugar. Some fruits are higher in sugars than others such as bananas and grapes. It's best to avoid fruits in general although you can have some small amounts of fruits that are low in sugar such as unsweetened cranberry juice and lemon water. In general, you want to avoid fruits that have a high glycemic index. What is Good Bacteria? Good bacteria is often a term that's not well-known. This term simply refers to beneficial bacteria that support the body and enhance its health naturally. One of the most well-known types of good bacteria are known as probiotics. [Probiotics](/blogs/health/probiotics-reduce-risk-of-antibiotic-related-diarrhea) are live bacteria which are found in fermented foods such as kimchi, yogurt, and similar foods or drinks. These probiotics are beneficial to your digestive system and aid in toxin removal.
