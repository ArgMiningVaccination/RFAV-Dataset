View the [figures here](https://www.merseycare.nhs.uk/download_file/view/1644/1139). Why do we need immunisation? The national immunisation programme has meant that dangerous diseases, such as polio, have disappeared in the UK. But these diseases could come back - they are still around in many countries throughout the world. That's why it's so important for you to protect yourself. In the UK, such diseases are kept at bay by the high immunisation rates. How do vaccines work? A vaccine contains a small part of the bacterium or virus that causes a disease, or tiny amounts of the chemicals the bacterium produces. Vaccines work by causing the body's immune system to make antibodies (substances to fight infections and diseases). So if you come into contact with the infection, the antibodies will recognise it and protect you. Pre-school and school aged immunisations When your child starts school or transfers school please ensure your school has your most up to date email address and mobile telephone number, to ensure you receive the link to your Childs immunisation information and consent form.
