What our clients say : Our Services Our Specialties About Acupuncture & TCM Acupuncture, medicinal remedies, tui na (Chinese massage), and other practices are all part of traditional Chinese medicine. It is a comprehensive medical system that has been used for 5,000 years to identify, treat, and avoid diseases. The yin and yang theory, on which TCM is founded, states that when yin and yang are in balance, one feels both energised and relaxed. Imbalances due to physical, emotional or lifestyle variables can result in illness, disease or discomfort. By employing your body's own energy, acupuncture seeks to balance and promote health in the most natural manner possible. To achieve balance, acupuncture stimulates particular points with extremely fine needles. This encourages the movement of your body's natural energy through meridians, the pathways by which blood, fluids, and other bodily substances move.
