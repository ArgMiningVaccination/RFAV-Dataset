Similia similibus curentur - what a substance can cause can also cure. Nettles are an example of this. A skin problem which feels like nettle stings could probably be helped by the remedy made from nettles. After giving the chosen remedy careful thought needs to be given to the change of symptoms. The objective is to observe what changes in the case. We can use up to 3,500 remedies in the 21st century. Research is taking place all the time - some double-blind trial (DBT and some qualitative research). Deep observation is necessary to observe the vital force or life force of the client. Given the opportunity every client will express what their feelings are - not just surface feelings but those deep within them affecting their wellbeing and attitudes to life which guard their most central feelings. The homeopath observes these feelings and must not create their own interpretation of them. I will expand on individual cases - 1) Russian + dreadful arthritis: 2) re Lenningrad case+ stopped speaking for 10 years and used dance to express herself: 3) Wartime memories and fire. To observe relevant information about client needs we need to listen to all mental, emotional and physical symptoms without altering their ideas to what we think we observe. The observer (the prescriber) needs to be meticulous about recording the observation as the client expresses it without amending the direction or description of those symptoms. Individualisation is very specific and accurate recording of these is essential to tracking movement of symptoms for the client. Is the client sleeping better? Had bowel and urinary function altered in any way? Is client looking better - feeling better in themselves? The most useful symptom to be told you may well be \"I feel more like my old self even though the complaints remain the same as before. I feel lighter etc. You have started some positive change. All of this may well reveal where the stuckness is in the client's life. Is the 75-year-old woman still repetitively complaining about what her mother said when she was four? Stuckness - reveals itself in many ways, then you may also receive a specific instance when the client felt the deep symptom that is worrying them. This method is true holistic case-taking using the medicine of similars not opposites. This allows thought to be given to the timeline of the client and the cause of the disruption in their health. The work of this charity will initially be FREE to all users.

Plastic is ubiquitous. Recent studies have highlighted that plastic is in bottled and tap water and in food products including honey, sugar and beer. 3-10 tonnes is estimated to fall on Paris per year. Global concern regarding the health implications is mounting, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) announcing a risk assessment review of plastics. Meanwhile we remain to eat, drink and inhale plastic without knowing what it is doing to us or indeed if we can eliminate it. Carina will discuss the scale of global microplastic contamination, where it comes from, how plastic enters the body, the health implications of inhaling and ingesting plastics and most importantly how plastic is detoxed and what are the most effective liver herbs to maximise plastic detoxification. Learn how plastic is detoxed and affects Phase 1 cytochrome P450 enzyme group and Phase II pathways including glutathione, glucuronidation and sulphation and the how ingested plastics, including phthalates and BPA, and inhaled plastics, including dioxins and furans are detoxed by these processes and what herbal medicine and nutritional supplementation can maximise plastic metabolism and excretion. The presentation will also cover the danger of inadequate plastic detoxification and how this can damage RNA and DNA and contribute to early ageing and cancer formation.

These patches normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. Most people are only affected with small patches. In some cases, the patches can be itchy or sore. Psoriasis is a long-lasting (chronic) disease that usually involves periods when you have no symptoms or mild symptoms, followed by periods when symptoms are more severe. Statistics and Prevalence 125 million people worldwide - 2% to 3% of the total population - have psoriasis, according to the World Psoriasis Day. Psoriasis prevalence in African Americans is 1.3% Psoriasis is the most prevalent autoimmune disease in the United States. Psoriasis affects around 2% of people in the UK. Men and women develop psoriasis at equal rates. Psoriasis occurs when skin cells are replaced more quickly than usual. It's not known exactly why this happens, but research suggests it's caused by a problem with the immune system. Although there are several different types of psoriasis, all are considered autoimmune disorders, meaning they develop when the body's immune system turns on itself and attacks healthy tissue in this case, skin in much the same way it would a real threat, such as bacteria or a virus. Researchers don't understand psoriasis completely, but it is believed to be a genetically-driven disorder that can be stimulated or exacerbated by factors such as stress , injury, illness, or weather.

Health Care Workers (HCW) themselves are statistically the most influenza vaccine hesitant group in the population. With calls being made to make influenza vaccine programmes compulsory, evidence needs to be taken seriously and a critical assessment made. The speaker will discuss what is the growing consensus of the ineffectiveness of the influenza vaccine and the reasons. According to Professor of Virology at Warwick University, Andrew Easton, \"A judgement should be made about replacing this [influenza] vaccine in the current climate of limited NHS budget. A re-think is also needed as other therapeutic aids are showing promise.\" The speaker will discuss alternative evidence based herbal medicine and supplements that specifically match the pharmacological action of drugs to reduce influenza incidence and mortality, and boost natural immunity to provide long standing protection. Topics include increasing interferon and how this works not only as a prophylactic and treatment for influenza but, by addressing Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) dysfunction, simultaneously has the capacity to reduce the incidence of autoimmune disease (caused by molecular mimicry). Other topics include viral replication inhibition using natural neuraminidase and polymerase inhibitors and compounds in herbal medicine that specifically reduce the inflammatory cascade known as the cytokine storm, associated with high mortality in influenza pandemics.Speaker Biography Carina Harkin holds 3 internationally recognised level 8 (EQF/AQF/NFQ/ Level 6 Ofqual) Bachelor of Health Science degrees in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), being the world's first triple degree CAM graduate and she is completing a Master in Public Health MPH.

Sadly this approach treats us as though we are machines rather than highly developed individuals as described by Samuel Hahnemann (SH Organon). Individualisation at core of life essential when searching for causes. SH described disease as disturbance of Vital Force which in health retains organism in admirable, harmonious, vital operation for both sensation/function. (SH The Organon P9). Definition applies to people, animals and plants. Many people use ARNICA without realising they are using a potentised flower energy-potentised ARNICA ENERGY . Homeopathic medicine is system of medicine based on exact knowledge of nature, pure experience and careful experiments. Allopathic model does not generally do this. (SH Organon P 52) at a deeper level by listening to patient in depth.Plants-when plants are transplanted there is setback watering plants with arnica in the water enables the plant to recover more quickly (Vaikunthanath Das Kaviraj 2012) (VDK). Homeopathy for Farm and Garden expands knowledge of use of homeopathy for bacterial and fungal diseases. Homeopathic medicine has 3,500 remedies which promote very specific individualisation when searching for remedy. Homeopathy - complete system of natural medicine treating people - researching on humans for humans and on animals for animal treatment. Homeopathic energy medicine stimulates body's healing power while searching for cause and treating cause rather than just treating symptoms. Speaker Biography Helen Campbell is the founder of Homeopathy Foundation SCIO, 2019. She is a Registered Homeopath and works passionately for Alternative Medicine which can be alternative and / or complementary. She has set up an educational Charity to help the community learn what is available when treating people not diseases. e: polwarth199@gmail.comPage 24alliedacademies Alternate Medicine 2019 International Conference on Alternative Medicine and Traditional Medicine June 10-11, 2019 | Edinburgh, ScotlandWorkshopalliedacademies Page 25Notes: Allied Journal of Medical Research | Volume 3June 10-11, 2019 | Edinburgh, ScotlandAlternative Medicine and Traditional MedicineInternational Conference on The causes of mental disturbance are multifaceted and highly complex, but evidence suggests that the modern approach to mental health is limited and largely ineffective judging by the increasing number of people suffering from mental health issues. There is more violence, suicide, depression, anxiety, addiction and a prolific use of psychotropic, prescription drugs than ever before. Yet it is known that the use of medications for mental illness causes dependancy and adverse side-effects, but an alternative, comprehensive approach has never been explored. Modern culture, where money is God, is a breeding ground for mental disturbance. Loneliness, isolation, the dissolution of family and community, and the constant bombardment of toxic material on the collective mind, are curses of our time. In addition, is the fact that food available to most people is mass produced, contaminated by chemicals and low in nutritional value all contributing to mental ill-health. The Vedas recognised mental illness thousands of years ago by understanding the connection between the body, mind and spirit. Ayurveda and Yoga which are Vedic sciences address the body, mind and spirit to get to the root cause of disease. Vedic philosophy does not describe psychology but recognises that mental disturbances manifest as imbalances of all aspects of the human condition, each one affecting the other. Vedic philosophy and the principles of Ayurveda and Yoga with the understanding of the mind and its connection to spirituality is an effective, long-term and permanent solution to the mental health issues of modern society.
