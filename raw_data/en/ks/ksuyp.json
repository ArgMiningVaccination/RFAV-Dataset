The development and creation of isihcik\u00eawinihk k\u00e2k\u00ee n\u00e2tawihon was funded by the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB) Trust Fund through the University of Calgary and in partnership with kih\u00eaw waciston - MacEwan University. In ceremony and in language, the authors met with twenty-three knowledge-keepers and Indigenous community members who shared their experiences of \"healing through ceremony\". Through protocol and relationship, the knowledge-keepers and Indigenous community members gave permission to the authors to have the teachings and stories recorded and documented. The audio-visual learning experience came to be understood as an experience of kiskinowapahtam - to heal, teach, and learn by watching and doing. The teachings and stories shared in isihcik\u00eawinihk k\u00e2k\u00ee n\u00e2tawihon guide social workers towards understanding how to support Indigenous communities with healing from the legacy of Residential Schools and the lasting intergenerational impacts of colonization. isihcik\u00eawinihk k\u00e2k\u00ee n\u00e2tawihon supports the preservation of Indigenous knowledge regarding healing and ceremony and directly impacts current and future generations through providing this knowledge to social workers serving Indigenous communities. From this teaching experience, the knowledge-keepers, community members, and authors share a collective vision that Indigenous children, families, and communities encounter social workers who understand, honor, and trust the healing that happens in ceremony.
