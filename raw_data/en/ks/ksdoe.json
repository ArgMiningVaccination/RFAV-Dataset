Unity was at the forefront of this movement, and Unity's fourth principle states, \"There is Divine Power in meditation and affirmative prayer which increases our awareness of our oneness with God.\" These truths of healing are found in many different spiritual paths. In the 19th century, Myrtle Fillmore, co-founder of Unity, was healed by regularly affirming \"I am a child of God, and therefore I do not inherit sickness.\" In the 20th century, Joel Goldsmith wrote in The Art of Spiritual Healing, that the consciousness that heals is one of convicted \"oneness\" or what Ernest Holmes (founder of current day Centers for Spiritual Living) might have called \"Unification\". UCOH continues these healing traditions and welcomes new discoveries linking science and spirituality. New methods and practices by current day masters such as Dr. David Hawkins, Joe Dispenza, and Dr. Sue Morter have found their home here as well. Through our Healing & Meditation Ministry we offer many modalities to help you tap into your innate potential for divine healing. "}
