To quote Dr. Paul Saladino: \"I've got bad news for you: Kale doesn't love you back.\" In this day and age, when veganism is (seemingly) booming, I have a somber word of warning: Vegetables want you dead. Little did you know that those green leaves in your smoothie are filled with poisons designed to make you sick. I know, it sounds unbelievable. After all, even if you're not a vegan, most people eat plants regularly. How could it be true that these foods are all poisonous? Well, how else could they defend themselves? Sorry to burst your bubble, but plants do not want to be eaten. It just isn't evolutionarily feasible. What's to stop grazing herbivores from eating plants to extinction? As it turns out, nearly all plants contain defense chemicals designed for just this purpose: avoiding extinction by making whatever chews on them sick. Broccoli has sulforophane, and the high levels of oxalates in kale are plenty defense to keep would-be consumers at bay. These materials, which are often lauded as healthy for humans, are actually there to fight any would be predator. Even Herbivores Don't Binge We'll get into the basic biology of plant toxins soon, but first I want to address the way herbivores eat their food. After all, these creatures eat almost exclusively plant material. If plants are poisonous, then what gives? Why aren't deer constantly sick and dying? Well, for one thing, well adapted herbivores have a host of chemical defenses against plant toxins. Moose and other grazers have [enzymes in their saliva](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/range556/appl_behave/projects/toxins-wildlife.htm#:~:text=Herbivores%20use%20odor%20and%20taste,and%20repelled%20by%20bitter%20flavors.&text=Thus%2C%20mule%20deer%20are%20able,eat%20one%20poisonous%20plant%20alone.) as well as multiple stomachs which deactivate plant toxins such as tannins. Even with these adaptations, ruminant animals, the most well adapted creatures to eating plants, don't binge. Herbivores have been observed to constantly shift between different plant food sources, eating some old grass today, young grass tomorrow, chewing on a twig later, etc. "}
