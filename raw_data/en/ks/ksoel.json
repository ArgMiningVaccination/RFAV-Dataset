A\"primary\" POI occurs without being caused by postop-erative complications. A \"secondary\" POI occurs due toa postoperative complication such as infection, anasto-motic leak, obstruction, etc. (2). Prolonged POI reduces patient satisfaction, delays hospital discharge, andincreases the cost of hospital care (3,4). A POI is considered prolonged if it lasts >5 days (5). Earlier data demonstrated that after surgery smallbowel motility typically returns in <1 day, and colonic motility in 3-5 days(6). The types of surgery that are most likely to causePOI include major surgeries in the abdomen and pelvis(5) particularly bowel resections (5) and colon surgery(7). However, other types of procedures have also beenNUTRITION ISSUES IN GASTROENTEROLOGY, SERIES #90 Kate Willcutts, MS, RD, CNSD, Nutrition Support Spe- cialist, University of Virginia Health System, DigestiveHealth Center of Excellence, Charlottesville, VA.The standard method for initiating and advancing oral diet after surgery is evolving. The old approach includes nasogastric decompression and withholding oral diet untilbowel function has clearly returned. While the use of nasogastric tubes (NGT) fordecompression after surgery is not as common, the initiation of oral diet is still oftenheld until the perceived return of bowel function. The resumption of an oral diet in this setting may begin with ice chips or sips of clear liquids, and then advance to clearliquids, then gradually to a regular diet. There is substantial evidence that this tradi-tional approach is unnecessary in most instances. This paper will review that evidenceas well as address the role of nutrition in the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)pathways.Carol Rees Parrish, R.D., M.S., \u0081 DECEMBER 2010 20documented to cause POI. Those include: cardiac surgery, orthopedic surgery and trauma (2). The pathogenesis of POI is believed to be multi- factorial. There appear to be four different pathwaysinitiated by surgical stress that lead to POI: neurogenic(activation of inhibitory reflexes), hormonal, andinflammatory responses, and analgesic opioids) (2). The incidenceof POI has been reduced over the years with improve-ments in surgical techniques and anesthesia (8). Infact, there are some who question whether primaryPOI exists (8). NASOGASTRIC DECOMPRESSION Historically, surgeons have waited until gut functionreturns before removing the decompressing NGT andallowing oral or enteral feeding; this is particularlytrue after abdominal or pelvic surgeries due to fear ofcomplications caused by increased bowel contents.These complications include aspiration and subse-quent pneumonia, wound dehiscence, anastomoticbreakdown and subsequent fistula formation (9). Theyalso believed that NGT decompression reduced POI,nausea and vomiting. The tradition of leaving in a NGT after surgery until the POI resolved was initially questioned in thepublished literature in the early 1980's. Multiple stud-ies since then have shown that postoperative use ofNGT for decompression does not reduce postoperativenausea and vomiting (PONV) (10,11), or reduce anas-tomotic or other complications (11,12). In fact, discon-tinuing the use of NGTs in the post-op period has beenshown to shorten POI and reduce fever, atelectasis andpneumonia (13). Avoidance of NGTs is one compo-nent of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)protocols that will be discussed later in this article. Arecently published survey showed 76% of respondingU.S. surgeons (n = 407) removed the NGT on POD 0or did not use one at all (5). Selective use of the NGTis the current recommendation . MARKERS OF BOWEL FUNCTION Part of the confusion associated with studying the topic of postoperative nutrition is the lack of a clearmarker designating the return of bowel function. Stud- ies have shown that lack of bowel sounds (BS), pas-sage of flatus or stool are not diagnostic for an ileus(14-18). BS are an unreliable marker of normal bowel func- tion for several reasons. Prior to resumption of coordi-nated motility after surgery there are random electricalimpulses followed by random muscle contractions(19). In this situation, BS can indicate antegrade move-ment of bowel contents (20). Furthermore, BS may ormay not be present with normal bowel activity (21). Waiting for first flatus or stool is not a timely mea- sure of the initial return of bowel function. Early post-operative feeding studies have demonstrated thatfeeding can safely begin prior to the return of flatus orstool (22-26). Feeding may actually be helpful in reducing POI by stimulating bowel motility. Of note, the time framesfor the return of bowel function after surgery are basedon return of bowel function without feeding. Studies have shown quicker return of bowel function withfeeding (27-29). Kasparek studied colonic motilityafter early food status post colorectal surgery (29).They found that feeding a high fat (53% of kcals) mealof 500 kcals total on 1resulted in increased colonic motility when comparedto standard treatment of nil per os (NPO). Unfortu- nately, a high percentage (66%) of the patients experi-enced nausea after this meal. The authors questionedwhether a lower fat meal would produce a similarreturn of colonic function without causing nausea. LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY There is little evidence to support the practice of leav-ing an NGT in after surgery and waiting for the tradi-tional markers of bowel function return prior tostarting an oral diet. In fact, when technologyadvanced to the point that laparoscopic surgeries couldbe performed, surgeons no longer applied the samerules regarding postoperative feeding. Patients' dietswere advanced quickly due to the surgeons' theory thatthis less invasive procedure that involved less bowelmanipulation and anesthesia would naturally not causea POI or if so, it would naturally be shorter (18). Sincethen it has been demonstrated that laparoscopicNUTRITION ISSUES IN GASTROENTEROLOGY, SERIES #90Pre-op NPO and Traditional Post-op Diet Advancement (continued from page 16)surgery results in a 30% reduction in length of POI and hospital stay (30). Two separate studies (18,31) evalu-ated laparoscopic vs. open procedures in colorectalsurgery patients. In both studies, the laparoscopicgroup tolerated earlier oral diet and had a shorter hos-pital length of stay (LOS). EARLY RECOVERY AFTER SURGERY PATHWAYS Early feeding after surgery is a component of the path-ways that have been used to enhance overall recoveryafter surgery. The Early Recovery After Surgery(ERAS) pathway or modifications of it include up to20 perioperative interventions (32). Most of the path-ways that have been published involve lower gastroin-testinal (GI) surgery patients. The interventionstypically include: extensive preoperative counseling,no bowel preparation, antibiotic prophylaxis, limitedpreoperative fasting, etc. (see Table 1). Use of suchpathways has led to earlier return of GI function andshorter hospital LOS by 1-4 days (33) . The enhanced recovery pathways originated in Europe. A survey done in the U.S. by Delaney and col-leagues (5) showed 30% of the surgeons whoresponded worked in hospitals that had a perioperativeprotocol for patients undergoing bowel resections.Hospitals with electronic medical records (EMR) moreoften used care pathways than those without EMRs.The interventions that were most common to the path-ways used in the U.S. were: early ambulation, earlydiet progression, opioid-sparing techniques and earlyremoval of NGT or no NGT at all (5). Overall use of astandard pathway like the ERAS is still rare in the U.S. PREOPERATIVE FASTING AND PREOPERATIVE CARBOHYDRATE LOADING One component of the ERAS-type pathways addresses preoperative fasting and carbohydrate loading.Despite the lack of evidence to support the practice ofpreoperative fasting, many U.S. hospitals begin a pre-operative fast at midnight before the surgery (31). Thecurrent evidence supports changing the practice byshortening the length of fasting time. The ERAS-typepathways address this change in preoperative fastingas well as carbohydrate loading. A Cochrane review published in 2003 that included 22 randomized controlled trials (RCT) concluded thatchanging the preoperative fasting to clear liquids until2 hrs prior to surgery does not increase risk of compli-cations (34). In fact, guidelines from Scandinavian andAmerican Anesthesiology groups now recommendclear liquids until 2 hrs and solid foods until 6 hrs priorto starting anesthesia (35,36). The benefits of this prac-tice include reduced preoperative hunger, thirst, andanxiety (34) and improved insulin sensitivity postoper-atively (37). Furthermore, 2 randomized controlled tri-als show shorter LOS and faster recovery in colorectalsurgery patients who receive preoperative carbohy-drates such as: a hypo-osmolar maltodextrin drink 800 mL the night before surgery and 400 mL threehours prior to surgery (38,39). LARGE BOWEL SURGERY The majority of early oral feeding studies have beendone in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery PRACTICAL GASTROENTEROLOGY \u0081 DECEMBER 2010 21NUTRITION ISSUES IN GASTROENTEROLOGY, SERIES #90Pre-op NPO and Traditional Post-op Diet Advancement Table 1. Suggested Summary Guidelines: From Evidence to Bedside \u0081 Extensive preoperative counseling \u0081 \u0081 Limited preoperative fasting: solids allowed until six hrs prior to surgery and clear liquids up until two hrs before surgery \u0081 Thoracic epidural\u0081 Selective use of NGT or early removal of NGT\u0081 Avoidance of perioperative fluid overload \u0081 Early (POD 0 or 1) feeding and oral supplements 200 mL 2-3 times/day from the day of surgery until\"normal food intake achieved\" \u0081 Continue supplementation (nutrition support) if the patient was malnourished baseline and early mobilization \u0081 Consider gum chewing for 30 minutes TID on POD 1\u0081 Early ambulation\u0081 Opioid-sparing techniquesPRACTICAL GASTROENTEROLOGY \u0081 DECEMBER 2010 22(16,23,26,40,41). Each study has different methods in terms of how they introduce oral feedings in theirstudy and control groups. However, they have allshown that compared to the control group, the earlyoral feeding groups have no more complications, andin some, the early fed group had shorter hospital LOS(14-16,40,42,43). SMALL AND LARGE BOWEL SURGERY While most studies have investigated lower bowelsurgery or gynecologic surgery, several studies havecombined patients undergoing both upper and lowerbowel surgery. Binderow and colleagues randomized64 patients who had undergone open colon or ilealresection to regular diet on POD 1 vs. waiting for stoolprior to starting an oral diet (18). They found no dif-ferences in the need for replacement of NGT due tonausea and vomiting or in the length of the POI.Behrns and colleagues randomized 44 patients under-going surgery on their small bowel (35%), colon(53%) or both (12%), to standard treatment of clearliquids after stool or flatus vs. starting clear liquids onPOD 2 (14). The control group was maintained onclear liquids until they tolerated 750 mL/day at whichpoint they were advanced to a solid diet and then dis-charged after tolerating 3 meals. The protocol for thestudy group was to receive clear liquids on POD 2,regardless of whether they had experienced flatus orhad a bowel movement, and they were to be dis-charged on clear liquids on POD 4 if there were nocomplications. Their diet was advanced at home basedon information gathered during post discharge phonecalls by a clinician on the research team. There was atrend towards reduced LOS in the study group (aver-age of 4 vs 6 days). Due to the small sample size thiswas not statistically significant (14). UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL SURGERIES While there is strong evidence suggesting that it is safeto feed soon after lower GI surgery, there is limitedevidence that this practice is safe in upper GI surgerypatients. Surgeons are hesitant to allow early feedingin this patient population due to the concern of theeffect of eating on gastric distention and potentialanastomotic leaks (27). One study in 447 patients who had undergone one of the following: hepatic, pancre-atic, gastric (total and GI surgeries were randomized to oral diet at willon POD 1 vs. jejunostomy feeding POD 1 and allow-ing oral diet on POD 6 (27). The orally fed group hada significantly shorter time to flatus after surgery, hadfewer post-discharge complications, and had no moremajor complications. In a smaller study, 35 patients who underwent gas- tric resection were randomized to 2 different diet pro-gressions: Early - sips of clears on POD 1, clear liquidson POD 2 and soft diet on POD 3 vs. Late = sips ofclears on POD 3, clear liquids on POD 4-5 and soft dieton POD 6 (28). The earlier fed group had significantlyfaster return to bowel function and shorter LOS. OTHER TYPES OF SURGERIES Although most of the studies cited thus far haveinvolved patients undergoing GI surgery, there aremultiple studies with similar results in gynecologicsurgery patients. A summary of the gynecologic stud-ies published by Cochrane reviews states that earlyfeeding is safe and associated with shorter hospitalLOS (44). However, there is increased nausea in theearly fed patients (44). There are also a few studies incardiac (45), urology (46), and otolaryngology surgerypatients (17) that show early feeding is safe. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Not all patients may be candidates for early oral dietafter surgery. Each of the studies reviewed aboveexcluded certain categories of patients. The most com-mon exclusion criteria were: patients who underwentemergent surgeries or combined surgeries. Othersincluded: history projectedprolonged hospital stay, perforation or abscess withassociated sepsis, life expectancy <3 months, short gutor other reason for requiring parenteral nutrition. Untilthese types of patients are included in early postopera-tive feeding studies, the safety of early postoperativeNUTRITION ISSUES IN GASTROENTEROLOGY, SERIES #90Pre-op NPO and Traditional Post-op Diet Advancement (continued on page 24)PRACTICAL GASTROENTEROLOGY \u0081 DECEMBER 2010 24oral feeding for these patients cannot be presumed. Furthermore, private communications with colorectalsurgeons indicates the heightened concern for aspira-tion pneumonia in the elderly and those with question-able mental status as their rationale for a more cautiousapproach in initiating and advancing oral diet aftersurgery in those patient groups. GUM CHEWING Six randomized trials and three meta-analyses havebeen published evaluating the practice of gum chewingafter surgery to reduce POI (47-49,50-55). The theoryis that gum chewing acts as sham feeding and as suchstimulates the cephalic phase of digestion therebyincreasing secretions from the salivary glands, stom-ach and biliopancreatic systems as well as increasingGI motility. In trials of elective colorectal surgerypatients, comparing standard treatment to gum chew-ing 3 times per day for 5-60 minutes POD1, the lengthof the POI was significantly shorter as demonstratedby less time to the first flatus, first stool and shorterLOS (47). MEDICATIONS Various medications have been studied to evaluatetheir effectiveness in reducing POI. Unfortunatelynone of the prokinetic medications have been effective(32). Use of laxatives for this purpose requires morestudy (56). Avoiding opioids such as morphine is rec-ommended due to their known inhibitory effect onbowel motility. A relatively new medication, alvi-mopan, a mu-opioid receptor antagonist that blocks theinhibitory effects of opioids on bowel activity, wasapproved in 2008 by the Food & Drug Administrationfor use in postoperative ileus. It has been shown toreduce the POI up to 28 hrs (2). POSTOPERATIVE DIET There is a lack of evidence for the use of clear liquiddiets after surgery. Jeffery and colleagues randomizedpatients to a clear liquid or regular diet after openabdominal surgery and found no difference in nauseaand vomiting (57). Of note, they did wait for \"return ofbowel function\" (as determined by the primary sur- geon) prior to starting the diet. Different approaches have been used to study the ideal postoperative diet. Kawamura and colleaguesused appetite as a guide (58). They allowed water, tea,and isotonic drink immediately after NGT removal inpatients after open and laparoscopic colon surgeries.Patients were then fed based on their appetite and pref-erences. By POD 1, 27% were eating and toleratingsolid foods. By POD 2, the number had risen to 81.3%and by POD 3, 97.1% were tolerating solid foods (58). Postoperative food preferences were studied in 145 patients who were allowed to eat within 24 hoursafter colorectal surgery (59). POD 1, the most com-monly preferred foods and beverages included: toast(80%), fruit juice pudding, yogurt andsandwiches (61%). Most of these foods are not part ofa clear or full liquid diet. On POD 2 similar foods andbeverages as well as cooked vegetables; hot cereal;and casseroles were chosen. Tolerance to these foodsand beverages was not evaluated in this study. CONCLUSION Based on the most current evidence a postoperativediet can be safely started prior to traditional markers ofthe return of bowel function in most patients and thatthe ideal postoperative diet is a patient self select diet.It is important to note that most studies evaluating ear-lier oral diet postoperatively excluded patients under-going emergent surgery. With regard to withholdingfeeding prior to surgery, better outcomes may beachieved by allowing oral diet with solid foods untilsix hours prior to anesthesia and carbohydrate contain-ing clear liquids until two hours prior to anesthesia. n References 1.
