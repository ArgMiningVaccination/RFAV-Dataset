My aim is to help you rebalance your state of being utilizing a natural and holistic approach.", "sitename": "Balance Acupuncture", "date": "2016-01-01", "cleaned_text": "My Philosophy A natural and holistic approach. Every disease, condition, or discomfort is essentially an out-of-balance state. The body reacts to imbalances by manifesting symptoms such as pain, allergies, asthma, digestive disturbances, gynecological problems, sleep difficulties, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, stress alone without a formal Western diagnosis can cause disharmony within the body, some of which can cause imbalances that are so subtle that they may not even be noticeable. These symptoms represent a state of instability or unevenness within the body, hence an out-of-balance state. My aim is to help you rebalance your state of being utilizing a natural and holistic approach. By addressing the entire body's impact on each symptom, each treatment is able to provide you with results and very often with no side effects. I believe this method is highly effective for helping the body to heal itself, assisting you on your journey back to balance. ABOUT Kiiko Matsumoto ACUPUNCTURE This gentle style of acupuncture, which is predominantly practiced at my office, is a style based on the teachings of Master Kiiko Matsumoto, a Japanese practitioner who studied with some of Japan's finest masters.

Insurance Unfortunately, I do not work with any insurance carriers. However, I can upon request provide the necessary paperwork for you to submit to your insurance company for reimbursement. If you have insurance and you wish to receive coverage for your acupuncture treatments, first you should do the following; - Double check that your policy covers acupuncture. - Inquire with you insurance company as to what conditions your policy covers for acupuncture treatment. - Ask how many treatments your policy will cover and how frequent treatments need to be (some carriers require treatments twice per week). - Find out how much of the cost is covered by treatment (this will give you an idea as to how much you should expect in reimbursement) - Confirm with your carrier if they need paperwork in the form of a superbill or you to submit. GET IN TOUCH 550 West Main Street Boonton, NJ + 1973 - 257 - 8924 Hours Monday - 9am - 6:30pm Tuesday - 2pm - 6:30pm Wednesday - 9am - 6:30pm Thursday - 9am - 1pm Friday - 9am - 3pm Only practitioner who considers how my whole body is doing. I knew Susannah as a fine massage therapist and couldn't wait for her to complete her acupuncture training and open her practice! I had been suffering monthly for years with terrible debilitating pain from a large uterine fibroid. Conventional medicine had nothing to offer except massive surgery and organ removal. Finally in 2007 Susannah was able to start my treatment, her training concluded. As the months progressed, each period got better and better and eventually menstruation was pain-free. She's my only practitioner who considers how my whole body is doing; she understands that everything is connected and is very empathetic. - DS, Wanaque, NJ Non-judgmental, caring, and truly listens to your concerns. Susannah is the consummate professional - one of the most ethical medical professionals with whom I've ever worked. My mom and I have been going to her regularly for over a year and she has helped us both immensely- from debilitating back and neck pain to knee pain, digestive issues, and adrenal/immune issues, she takes care of it all. She is non-judgmental, caring, and truly listens to your concerns. I also find that she will be completely honest with you if she does not feel that you will benefit from treatment. Unlike a lot of professionals out there, Susannah treats you as a human being, not a dollar sign. Since I started here I have gone from chronic pain to experiencing vibrant health! So grateful for Susannah! - LM, Morris Plains, NJ I'm going to do this acupuncture thing... what do I have to lose. Let me begin by saying I have been suffering from severe one sided headaches for as long as I can remember. Recently (last week) I had another one for 5 days straight. Nothing worked. I have some sort of neck issue, pinched nerves etc on my right side. I was always skeptical about this type of thing but stayed home from work this past Monday because my head/neck hurt so bad. I thought....I'm going to do this acupuncture thing...what do I have to lose. Well.....I lost myheadache!! Susannah saw me, evaluated me and got to work. I left her office at 3 pm and by 5 pm my headache was gone. It hasn't come back. I had another follow up appointment yesterday and still no headache. I am a BELIEVER! It didn't hurt...it was actually quite relaxing. She is professional but will answer any questions you have so you understand the answers. Very thorough. I can't wait to spread the news of her and her practice. Thank you Susannah for everything you have done for me!!!! BALANCE ACUPUNCTURE CENTER in Boonton. Go....you won't regret it. - JK, Parsippany, NJ "}
