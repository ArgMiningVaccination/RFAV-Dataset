How do you find holistic doctors?There are many holistically-minded doctors and medical care professionals almost everywhere. A holistic medicine practitioner approaches the body as an energy system, which is intimately influenced by beliefs and thoughts. Many other healthcare professionals besides M.D.'s and D.O.'s (doctors of osteopathic medicine) who are trained in various areas also share this approach.

However, they are often more open to alternative therapies than conventional M.D.'s. Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.): While physicians are usually thought of as people who primarily treat spinal distress, they're also able to practice functional medicine. They can't prescribe medications and typically have a medical physician they work with or recommend if you will need a traditional treatment. Ayurvedic Practitioner: What should you expect on a visit to a practitioner of Ayurvedic medicine? Vaidyas (Ayurvedic physicians ) will spend time assessing a patient's overall health and endurance.

The acupuncturist places whisper-thin needles to the arms, back, neck, and other areas in which the chi (or energy flow) was blocked. The acupuncture needles stimulate points on or beneath the skin called acupuncture points or acupressure points, releasing this qi. These pathways \u2014 known as\"meridians\" \u2014 become re-stimulated from the needles to bring healing and blood to the body. In Western medicine, acupuncture has been demonstrated to alleviate pain and help provide relief and healing from painful symptoms related to everything from headaches to asthma to cancer.
