These vaccines protect against specific diseases. The Qu\u00e9bec Immunization Program includes various free and voluntary vaccination programs. The decision to offer a free vaccine as part of the Immunization Program depends on the analysis of several criteria based on the disease targeted by the vaccine, in particular relating to: - Its seriousness - Its consequences - Its frequency - The number of people that catch it - The population groups affected - The existence of other methods to prevent the disease - The effectiveness and safety of the vaccine - The objectives, for example, the urgency with which the disease needs to be controlled - The comparison between the costs of vaccination and the medical and social costs associated with the disease and its complications - Acceptance of the vaccine by the public and health professionals - The availability of human and financial resources - The availability of the vaccine The Immunization Program includes ongoing monitoring and evaluation measures. Their application allows achievements to be quantified, problems to be discovered and resolved, and programs to be adjusted as needed.

To best protect your child, do not omit any vaccines and have them administered at the recommended ages. Children must receive their first vaccines at 2 months of age in order to be protected as soon as possible. Principles for establishing the immunization schedule For each vaccine, the immunization schedule is established according to the following principles: - The vaccine must be administered at the age when the risk of catching the disease is highest - The vaccine must be effective at the age when it is administered - The number of doses administered must result in short-term protection - The vaccine must be administered at the age when it causes the least symptoms - The need and timing for a booster must be evaluated to ensure long-term protection. Immunization schedules by age group Consult the immunization schedules below to find out at what age your child should receive vaccines that are essential for their protection. Your child must receive several doses of some vaccines to ensure long-term protection. These doses are called \"booster doses\". The new immunization schedule applies only to infants born on or after June 1, 2019. If your child was born before June 1, 2019, it is important to continue vaccination with the schedule that was recommended for them. Each schedule indicates the number of doses to be administered but also the interval between doses.
