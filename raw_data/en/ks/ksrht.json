This textbook is novel inits approach to emergency medicine topics. Itdescribes in detail the best and most current meth-odsto care for patients in the emergency depart- ment, including initial evaluation, generation ofdifferential diagnoses, problem solving, andmanagement of challenging conditions based onpresenting symptoms. Unlike other textbooks, inwhich the diagnosis is known, this textbookapproaches clinical problems as clinicians managepatients - without full knowledge of the finaldiagnosis. It provides an understanding for howto approach patients with undifferentiated con-ditions, ask the right questions, gather historicaldata, utilize physical examination skills, andorder and interpret appropriate laboratory andradiographic tests. This textbook also providescurrent management and disposition strategieswith controversies presented, including pearls,pitfalls, and myths for topics covered. Chaptersare written by nationally- and internationally-respected clinicians, educators, and researchers in the field of emergency medicine. An Introduction to Clinical Emergency Medicine offers just the right combination of text, clinical images, and practi-cal information for students, residents, physicianassistants, nurse practitioners, and experiencedphysicians in all medical disciplines. The over-riding goal of this textbook is to improve thepractitioner's understanding of emergency med-icine principles and practice, directly benefitingpatient care in a variety of emergency settings.An Introduction to EmergencyMedicine Swaminatha V .

It is a patientcomplaint-oriented specialty in which stabiliza-tion based on anticipation supersedes lengthydifferentials and diagnostic precision. In light of these unique aspects and attributes of clinical practice, one would expect the textbook-based literature supporting this specialty to beuniquely written and reflective of its singularapproach. This has rarely been the case, a fact thathas puzzled me for almost 30 years. It is true thatsequential prose does not accurately represent the parallel processing necessary to practice effec-tive and efficient emergency medicine. Still, itwould seem the ideas of priority diagnoses, stabi-lization, initial assessment, prioritized differentialdiagnosis, and the rest that follows could be delin-eated and emphasized within the limitations of theprinted word. I am pleased and delighted to findand convey to the reader that this text succeeds intranslating this untraditional emergency medicineapproach into a textbook format. This text, edited by two academicians, Swaminatha V . Mahadevan, MD and Gus M.Garmel, MD from one of the nation's premier aca-demic institutions and leading health care organ- izations, fulfills what I have long believed is thecorrect and necessary pathway to understanding the approach and thought processes that driveclinical decision- making in emergency medicine. The focus of the text is appropriately \"presentingcomplaint-oriented,\" with a thorough coverageof the chief complaints responsible for the major-ity of emergency department visits. Each chapteris structured in a consistent manner that allowsthe experienced and uninitiated alike to clearlytrack the thought process needed to bring one toa successful prioritized conclusion of care, evenwhen a specific diagnosis has not been made. The range of authorship is excellent, reflecting the talents and capabilities of an entire new gen-eration of emergency physicians trained in thespecialty. These authors clearly understand emer-gency medicine's unique principles. It is a rare gift to witness and participate in the passing of our unique specialty's visions ontothe capable hands of those you have had theopportunity to train and know. Due to this text- book's organization and content, I am pleased tofinally \"rest in peace,\" at least academically. Drs.Garmel and Mahadevan demonstrate their clearunderstanding and literary virtuosity in convey-ing the truth about our specialty to others. It is my pleasure to congratulate them on a successful venture, to warn them that havingstarted on this path serial additions and sub-sequent editions will rule their life for as long asthey, the publisher, and the sales last, and toexpress a personal sense of satisfaction and pridein their accomplishment. To the reader, I sayenjoy yourself. Take much away from this textand welcome the truth as we currently know it,presented in a manner that accurately reflects theway we practice. Glenn C.

Shock 85Principles of Emergency Medicine 3Approach to the emergency patient The emergency department (ED) is a challenging environment for patients, families, and medicalpersonnel. Many challenges result from our prac-tice's principles: available at any time for any patient with any complaint. Patients who cometo the ED are not familiar with us personally, yetmust feel confident about our abilities to helpthem during their time of greatest concern. Theirneeds may be as straightforward as an excusenote for work or a prescription refill in the mid-dle of the night, or as complex as an acute illnessor injury, an exacerbation of a chronic condition,or a cry for help if depressed or suicidal. Evenproviding reassurance about a child's fever to aconcerned parent is a critical function of emer-gency physicians (EPs). Qualities successful EPs exhibit include intel- ligence, sensitivity, humility, insight, proficiencymaking decisions with and acting on limitedinformation, and the ability to multi-task. Beingskillful negotiators, working well with individ-uals having different backgrounds and ethnicities,and advocating strongly for patients at all timesare essential qualities. In addition to these traits,EPs must be experts in trauma and medicalresuscitation of adults and children, and in sharing news with patients and family members about theoutcomes of these events. The majority of patients use the ED infre- quently. Many may be experiencing this settingfor the first time. Patients' lack of familiarity withthis environment, fear, stress, waiting times,painful procedures, and overall discomfort oftenpreclude them from having a positive experience.These are only some of the issues that patientscontend with in the ED. EPs confront numerous challenges when tak- ing care of patients presenting to the ED. Perhapsthe greatest challenge is the spectrum of diseaseswhich EPs must be able to identify. Rather than having to know only the first 15 minutes ofan illness, EPs must be familiar with all stages ofall illnesses, often presenting in atypical fashion.In addition, time pressures inherent to providingemergency care, the lack of existing relationshipswith patients, unfamiliarity with their medicalhistory, and the inability to review patients' med- ical records challenge EPs daily. EPs must rapidlyand simultaneously evaluate, diagnose and treatmultiple patients with multiple conditions, oftenwith limited information, without confusingsubtle nuances between patients. They must beinsightful, anticipatory, and prepared to act andreact to prevent morbidity and, when possible, mortality. Considering worse case scenarios is fundamental to EM practice. Most importantly,EPs must be comfortable providing detailed,often devastating information in a concise yetunderstandable manner to patients and familymembers who may have different cultural back-grounds. It is indeed a privilege to be in a position to offer care to patients during what is likely to betheir time of greatest need. Approaching patientssensitively, recognizing their apprehension, pain,concerns, and perhaps shame is critical to ourmission. This is true no matter how trivial apatient's problem may seem. Often, patients con-sult with EPs to seek approval about their desireto leave a spouse, to get an opinion regarding aphysician's recommendation for surgery, or toreceive confirmation that they are making the right decision about a parent, child, or loved one.Serving in this capacity, without judgment, is notonly appropriate but also essential. It is imperative that EPs approach each patient with an open mind, committed to identify andaddress not only the presenting problem but alsoany coexisting problems. For example, a patientwith the history and presenting complaint ofesophageal reflux may in fact have acute coronarysyndrome (ACS). A patient with the apparentproblem of insomnia may have an underlyingconcern about his or her safety, security, or men-tal wellness. The ability of an EP to evaluate eachpatient using history-taking and physical exam-ination abilities, as well as laboratory or radio-graphy interpretation skills, when appropriate, isonly a portion of our armamentarium. An experi-enced EPs \"sixth sense\" is something that, overtime, has become recognized and respected bynon-EM colleagues. Unfortunately, the ED environment is not always conducive to privacy. Despite the HealthInsurance Portability and Accountability Act(HIPAA) of 1996 and Protected Health 1Approach to the emergency patient Gus M. Garmel, MDApproach to the emergency patient 4Principles of Emergency MedicineInformation (PHI) for patients, attempts to main- tain patient confidentiality in the ED present acontinuous challenge. Discussions about patientcare issues between health care providers, staff,patients, and family members often take placebehind nothing more than a curtain. Sharedspaces, hallways, lack of private rooms or beds,and the demands of time-pressured discussions,often in open spaces, over the phone, or withconsultants stretch efforts at maintaining patientconfidentiality. The leadership role that EPs havein the ED affords them the opportunity to demon-strate r espect for patient confidentiality and to remind others of the importance of upholding this principle. Recently, there has been tremendous publicity regarding medical errors and patient safety. Human error may occur at any time, but is morelikely during high patient volumes or when mul-tiple complicated patients of high acuity presentsimultaneously. Error has been demonstrated tooccur more frequently when provider fatigue isgreatest (for example, at the end of a challengingshift or after being awake all night). Systemserrors are even more likely to occur during thesecircumstances. Attention has been placed onreducing errors and improving patient safety, using the airline industry as an example. Airlinepilots, however, are not required to fly more thanone plane at the same time, while simulatingtake-off, landing, and changing course. The EMcommunity should embrace the federal govern-ment's attention to medical systems and its rolein medical error, as patient safety is a top priority.Hospital quality committees review errors ofomission and commission, medication errors,errors in patient registration, and errors of judg-ment. Given the pace of the ED environment, it isremarkable that more errors do not occur. The rapid need for patient turnover, room changes,and test result reporting does not occur with suchimmediacy in most other areas of the hospital.Hospital administrators with limited insight aboutthe uniqueness of EM practice should focusattention to, and provide support for, this essentialaspect of patient care. EPs must recognize that patients signed over to them at the end of a shift pose increased risk.These patients typically have laboratory or X-rayresults pending, are being observed for continued improvement or worsening in their condition, orare waiting for consultants. They should havetreatment and disposition plans in place, prede-termined by the EP who initially evaluated thembased on anticipated outcomes. However, it maybe these signed-over patients do not have well-established dispositions and need a new EP'sperspective. In such cases, it is better to informthe receiving EP that a good understandingabout what is going on with that patient does notexist than leave things vague or unclear. As longas patients present to EDs at any time, patientssigned over at shift's end will continue to chal-lenge our ability to provide safe care within ourpractice. Scope of the problem Alandmark article by Schneider, et al. from the EM literature defines our specialty as one \"... withthe principle mission of evaluating, managing,treating and preventing unexpected illness andinjury.\" As emergency medical care is an essentialcomponent of a comprehensive health care deliv-ery system, it must be available 24 hours a day.EPs provide rapid assessment and treatment ofany patient with a medical emergency. In addi-tion, they are responsible for the initial assessmentand care of any medical condition that a patientbelieves requires urgent attention. One key aspectof this commentary is that patients may believethey require urgent attention, when in fact they donot. It remains our mission to provide patients theopportunity to receive sensitive medical care andreassurance even under this circumstance. EPs also provide medical support for individuals wholack access to other avenues of care. As the num-ber of uninsured and underinsured persons in theUS increases, and growing numbers of health clin-ics close, many of these individuals will use theED for their primary as well as emergency care.This has placed a tremendous burden on thesafety net provided by the specialty of EM. In 2000, ED visits climbed to 108 million, a 14% increase from 1997. In California, patientsvisiting EDs were found to be sicker than everbefore, with an increase in critical emergencycare visits by 59% between 1990 and 1999.Although there were just over 4,000 EDs in 2000,the number of EDs has decreased as hospitalsand trauma centers are forced to close. The num-ber of EPs in clinical practice reported by theAmerican College of Emergency Physicians(ACEP) in 1999 was just under 32,000, a decreasefrom 1997. There has been an increase in thenumber of nurse practitioners and physicianassistants trained to work in emergency care set-tings, and many hospitals are staffing urgent careand fast-track areas with these practitioners.Principles of Emergency Medicine 5Approach to the emergency patientWith decreased funding available for non-ED clinics, and increasing numbers of patients with- out health insurance who use the ED as their pri-mary (or only) source of health care, the worseningof ED overcrowding is inevitable. Hamilton describes the clinical practice of EM in his textbook as one that \"... encompasses theinitial evaluation, treatment, and disposition ofany person at any time for any symptom, event,or disorder deemed by the person - or someoneacting on his or her behalf - to require expedi-tious medical, surgical, or psychiatric attention.\"This philosophy creates tremendous challenges,as well as opportunities, unique to the specialtyof EM. EDs must be fully staffed and always pre-pared while never entirely certain of patientneeds at any given moment. Despite statistics onthe number of patients presenting at differenttimes on different days in different months, noone can predict the exact number of medical staffneeded to care for even one emergency patient.Clearly, staffing an ED to be fully operational isan expensive proposition given this scenario. Clinical scope of the problem Table 1.1 provides the ten most common reasons for patients to visit the ED, according to a 2001 sur- vey. Patients come to the ED due to only a few gen-eral categories of problems or complaints. Thesemay be grouped as follows, listed in decreasingfrequency. Pain Pain is the most likely reason for patients to seekmedical care at an ED. It can be traumatic oratraumatic in nature. Chest, abdominal, head,extremity, low back, ear, throat, and eye pain areonly a few examples. Difficulty with ... This can be difficulty with breathing, vision, urin-ation, swallowing, concentration, thinking, bal- ance, coordination, ambulation, or sensation.Difficulty controlling seizure activity would alsofall into this broad category. Fever Fever is common in children, and of great con-cern to parents. It can be a presenting complaintin adults as well. Conditions causing fever includeviral or bacterial infections, such as upper respira-tory infection (URI), gastroenteritis, otitis media,urinary tract infection asappendicitis, cholecystitis, atelectasis, and post-operative wound infections), obstetric-gynecologicproblems (such or cervical infections,mastitis, postpartum infections), deep venousthrombosis (DVT), drugs and drug interactions,cancer, infections, malaria or otherparasitic infections, vasculitis, and arthritis areother conditions causing fever. Bleeding Bleeding may be painful or painless, and may or may not have other associated symptoms. Examples include lacerations, vaginal bleeding(with or without pregnancy), gastrointestinal(GI) bleeding, epistaxis, and hematologic ill-nesses such as anemia, von Willebrand's disease,or hemophilia (often resulting in spontaneousbleeding). Social concerns Social issues for which patients come to the EDinclude an inability to care for oneself, a changein behavior (either organic or functional), drugand/or alcohol-related problems, homelessness,hunger, or concerns of family members thatsomething might be wrong. In EM, it is essential that care is coordinative , meaning that EPs should seek assistance withpatient care, relying on more than just the patientto assess the situation. Family members oftenprovide additional information about illness progression that patients fail to recognize or Table 1.1 Top 10 reasons for an ED visit (2001, National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey - CDC-P) Control and Prevention.neglect to share. Prehospital care providers often have useful information about the patient's liv-ing situation and how appropriate it is.Psychosocial aspects of each patient must be con-sidered when interpreting presenting complaints and determining patient dispositions, including the appropriate use of consultation. Involving aconsultant who focuses solely on his or her areaof expertise may result in a less optimal outcome,as he or she may overlook a combination of eti-ologies causing the pr oblem. When the care of a particular patient is beyond the scope of EM prac-tice, the EP must make certain that the \"proper\"consultants and the appropriate teams areinvolved. EPs must know how and where toaccess information, and to whom to turn in orderto ensure patient beneficence. EPs often coordin-ate patient care behind the scenes, without alwaysreceiving the recognition they deserve. Anatomic essentials Anatomic essentials for the patient presenting tothe ED are covered in detail throughout the text.Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, andExposure are crucial to the initial evaluation andmanagement of emergency patients with emer-gent or urgent conditions. This may be true forconditions that do not seem emergent at the time,such as the airway of a talking patient recently exposed to intense heat (fire, smoke, or steam).The airway is essential not only for gas exchange,but for protection against aspiration. It may beused for the administration of certain medications.With conditions causing increased intracranial pressure (ICP), airway management with modesthyperventilation results in cerebral vasoconstric-tion, one aspect of therapy. Breathing is not only dependent on the lungs, but on the thoracic cav-ity, respiratory musculature, and central nervoussystem (CNS). Circulation may be compromised as a result of hemorrhage, dehydration, vascularcatastrophe, cardiovascular collapse, or vasocon-striction or vasodilatation in response to shock.Evaluating disability includes a careful yet focused neurological exam, including an assess-ment of the level of consciousness, mini-mentalstatus, and evaluation of motor, sensory, reflexes,cranial nerves, and cerebellar function as appro-priate. A thorough understanding of neurovas-cular supply to extremities, especially followingtraumatic lacerations or injuries, helps identifylimb threats or potential morbidity. Knowledgeof dermatomes is also helpful when assessingneurologic symptoms. The Alertness, Verbalresponse, Pain response, Unresponsive (AVPU) scale and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) are twosimple evaluation tools that can be recorded todescribe general neurologic status of a patient, aswell as follow neurologic change over time.Exposure is essential so injuries are not missed, as well as to consider possible environmental elem-ents that may contribute to the presentation (e.g.,heat, cold, water, toxins). History The patient's history has always been consideredone of the most important elements in determininga final diagnosis. It is accepted that the history(and physical examination) can determine thediagnosis in up to 85% of patients. A patient's his-tory should focus on the current problem(s), allow-ing room to identify additional information anddetermine its relevance. When patients present inextremis, the traditional approach to obtaining thepatient's history must be abandoned. In this situa-tion, history and physical examination informa-tion must be obtained concurrently. EPs are oftenforced to rely on clinical assessment and impres-sion, and utilize many important diagnostic stud-ies during their decision-making. Some studiesthat assist in establishing a final diagnosis, such asan electrocardiogram (ECG), glucose, urine dip-stick, and other bedside tests can be obtainedwhile gathering historical data. However, estab-lishing a final diagnosis is not always possible dur-ing the course of the patient's evaluation in the ED.Fortunately, having a final diagnosis is not alwaysnecessary, as an appropriate disposition with follow-up evaluation and tests during hospitaliza-tion or as an outpatient may be of far greaterimportance. When approaching any emergency patient, a brief introduction using the appropriate prefix(doctor or medical student) is preferred bypatients. It is reasonable to include with thisintroduction relevant background information,such as your current level and specialty of train-ing. A gentle yet professional touch, such as ahandshake or touch of the wrist is a kind gesture.This gesture of reaching out to a patient is favor-ably received in general. Before questioning apatient about his or her present illness or medicalhistory, sit down at the patient's bedside if thesituation allows. This not only eliminates tower-ing over a patient, but demonstrates that you areinterested in what he or she has to say, and plan Approach to the emergency patient 6Principles of Emergency Medicineto be present and listen for a while (even if this time is short). Patients recall that the amount oftime their physician spent with them was greaterif their physician sat down during the interac-tion. After sitting down, listen to what the patient has to say. Physicians interrupt their patientsearly and often, and EPs are some of the biggestoffenders. Look patients in the eye so they know you are present, listening, and care about theirconcerns. If you will be taking notes during theinterview, do so following a short period of goodeye contact. Demonstrate respect for a patient's well-being and privacy by offering a pillow,blanket, adjusting their bed, assisting with cover-ing their person, or providing water (if appropri-ate). This can be done in a few seconds at thestart of each patient interaction. When possible, use open-ended questions to elicit historical information about a patient's condi-tion. This allows patients to describe their concernsusing their own terms. Certainly, some questionsrequire yes or no answers (\"Do you have dia- betes?\"). There will be times when directed ques-tions are required, such as to a patient in extremis,or when a patient does not answer questionspromptly or concisely. However, most patients willget to the point in a relatively short time. The P-Q-R-S-T mnemonic assists with gather- ing important historical elements of a presentingcomplaint from a patient. Using the example of\"pain,\" questions relating to the history of apainful condition include (Table 1.2): Additional historical information to learn may be obtained using the mnemonic A-M-P-L-T-O-E (Table 1.3).Information regarding a patient's family and social history should also be reviewed. Familymembers with similar illnesses or conditionswho present similarly to this patient are import-ant to identify. Examples include a strong familyhistory of cardiac or thromboembolic disease,appendicitis, gallbladder disease, or cancer.Social history includes the patient's living situa-tion, marital status, use or abuse of tobacco, alco-hol, and/or drugs, occupation, and handedness(in the setting of neurologic disease or extremitytrauma). Several key questions might therefore include: How did the pain begin (sudden vs. gradualonset)? What were you doing when the pain began? What does the pain feel like? On a scale of 0-10, how severe is the pain? Where is your pain? Has it always been there? Does the pain radiate anywhere else? Does anything make the pain better or worse? Have you had this pain before? Principles of Emergency Medicine 7Approach to the emergency patient Pis for provocative/palliative , as in \"What makes this pain worse or better?\" Qis for the quality of pain, as in \"Describe your pain?\" or, \"Is your pain sharp or dull?\" Ris for region/radiation , as in \"What region of body does this pain occur?\" and \"Does it radiate, or move, to any other location(s)?\" Sis for severity , which may be communicated using a numeric scale from 0-10 or a happy-sad facesscale.

Questions might include \"When didthe pain start?\", \"How long did the pain last?\", and\"What were you doing when the pain started(eating, exertion, watching television, going to bed)?\"Table 1.2 P-Q-R-S-T mnemonic for historyAis a reminder to discuss allergies to medications, latex, seasonal allergens, or other things. Mis for medications , including prescription and non- prescription. Surprisingly, many patients do notconsider acetaminophen, ibuprofen, oralcontraceptives, insulin, or vitamins (includingherbal remedies) to be medications, and do notoffer this information. Pis for previous or past medical history , which may provide a clue to the present condition. If thispatient has had a similar illness before, he or shemay have it again, or is at greater risk for it torecur. Lis for last meal , perhaps the least helpful of these questions. Last meal does, however, relate toairway protection in the event of proceduralsedation or a surgical procedure. Tis for tetanus status, which should be updated every 5-10 years, depending on the type of wound and its likelihood for being tetanus-prone. Ois for other associated symptoms/operations . Associated symptoms may assist in reaching adiagnosis, and may afford the opportunity torelieve discomfort. Some patients do not includeprevious surgeries in their medical history. Eis for events/EMS/environment , which include the events leading up to the illness, the role of the emergency medical system (EMS) duringtransport (interventions, complications), ifapplicable, and any environmental influences onthe presentation (heat, cold, rave or other party).Table 1.3 A-M-P-L-T -O-E mnemonic for additional historyHave any family members had pain similar to this? What do you think is the cause of your pain? Associated symptoms are important, as manydiseases have a specific collection of symptomsassociated with them. The concept of parsimony is an important one, in which a diagnosis has ahigher likelihood of being correct if one diseasecan be used to explain the entire constellation ofassociated symptoms. This provides a more likelyexplanation than the coincidence of more than one disease being responsible. Additional cau-tion should occur with patients at the extremes ofage (newborn and elderly), as the likelihood ofserious infections, decreased physiologic reserve,and comorbid or coexisting conditions increasesin these patients. Some key associated symptomsare listed in Table 1.4. Warning signs in the his-tory are provided in Table 1.5: Physical examination The physical examination should be completeenough to identify unexpected conditions, whilefocused on areas likely to be contributing to orresponsible for disease. Unfortunately, many EPs are challenged for time and act quickly, perform-ing abbreviated physical examinations while rely-ingon laboratory and radiologic studies. In some circumstances, this may be necessary. However, itis best to do a detailed, problem-pertinent physi-cal examination so that important findings arenot missed. In addition, concentrating on associ-ated organ systems that may have a role in the ill-ness is recommended. These areas may provide clues to the etiology of the pain or illness. In fact, establishing a comprehensive differential diag-nosis for that patient's complaint and examiningareas of the body that may contribute to the con-dition allows EPs to prioritize the likelihood ofother diagnoses causing the symptoms. As this chapter describes the approach to the emergency patient, it will address only the gen-eral appearance, vital signs, and physical exam-ination pearls in general. Other chapters providegreater detail for a particular condition or con-stellation of symptoms. General appearance This may be the most important element of thephysical examination for EPs, as it assists withdetermining who is sick and who is not.Experienced EPs can look at patients and have areasonably accurate idea of who needs to be hospi- talized. This is one reason why EPs feel concern forpatients in the waiting room, whom they have notyet visualized. General appearance is particularlyimportant in the pediatric population, as socialinteraction, playfulness, physical activity (includ-ing strength of cry) and hydration status (amountof tears, for example) are significant findings thatcan be identified within moments. The youngerthe patient is, the more difficult it is for EPs todetermine wellness based on general appearancealone. The fact that a patient's general appearanceis less helpful to EPs at the extremes of age makescaring for these patients more challenging.

Genitourinary symptoms Dysuria, frequency, urgency, Obstetric/Gynecologic age of menarche, contraception,fertility, sexual activity, sexually-transmitted infections, vaginal discharge or bleeding, dyspareunia, previous surgeries, recent procedures, and other pelvicinfections. Neurologic symptoms Weakness, difficulty speaking, concentrating, swallowing, or thinking, imbalance, sensory changes, visual problems, and headache.Vital signs Vital signs are important for all emergency patients. A complete set of vital signs should be obtained and repeated during the emergencyvisit. Often, the vital signs are obtained in triageand not repeated until many hours later whenpatients are placed in examination rooms. ManyEDs have policies that vital signs must berepeated for patients in the waiting room. This is a wise strategy, even though abnormal vital signsmay not require action. EPs should at the veryleast review one complete set of appropriate vitalsigns on every patient, and address each abnor-mal vital sign (or consider why it is abnormal).At times, rechecking the vital signs is extremelyimportant, such as the heart rate in a patient withACS or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), therespiratory and heart rates in patients with breathing difficulty, or the temperature of a childwho experienced a febrile seizure. It is of fargreater importance to recheck the temperature ofa previously afebrile patient with a possible sur-gical condition or serious bacterial infection thana febrile child's temperature following acetamino-phen or ibuprofen if they now well-appearing,playful, and at low-risk for a febrile seizure.Orthostatic vital signs (heart rate and blood pres-sure in supine, sitting, and standing positions)are inherently time-consuming, unreliable, andnonspecific. However, if the situation suggests thatthese measurements would be in the patient'sbest interest, they may provide useful information(Table 1.6). It is good practice to recheck a patient'svital signs prior to discharge. Pearls specific to the physical Be professional Aprofessional greeting and introduction should evoke warmth and kindness. Patients want to know that the EP they \"have\" (they did not\"choose\") is considerate, sensitive, thoughtful,competent, and listens well; in other words, atrue professional. Most patients aren't interestedin a joke or a discussion of current events whenthey are in the ED, at least not immediately. EPs should wear clean and appropriate clothing,be polite, well-mannered, well-groomed, and appear well-r ested. A current hospital ID badge with name and photograph should be promi-nently displayed. A health care provider shouldnever bring food or beverages into the examina-tion room.Go slowly Try not to rush patients, or to seem rushed, despite how busy you may be. Speak slowly and clearly, with increased volume for elderly patientsshould they need it. Warm and clean hands areessential for patient comfort. If you are usinggloves, tell patients that this is your practice for allpatients. A well-lighted, warm room (if possible)is also preferred. Having a chaperone of the samegender as the patient present is always a goodidea, especially during examination of private(genitals, breasts, pelvic and rectal) areas. Again,let patients know that this is your standard prac-tice and you are doing it for their benefit (even ifyou are protecting yourself as well). Having trans-lators or family members present (when appropri-ate) also makes patients more comfortable. Principles of Emergency Medicine 9Approach to the emergency patient 1.General appearance (perhaps the most important and underutilized vital sign) 2.Temperature (rectal temperature should be considered in newborns or infants, and theelderly who are hypothermic, tachypneic andmouth-breathing, or in patients with alterations ofconsciousness) 3.Heart rate (including strength, quality, andregularity) 4.Respiratory rate (often miscalculated due tomultiplication error) 5.BP (consider orthostatic BP , although may befalsely negative; also consider BP measurements in each arm or upper and lower extremities incertain conditions) 6.Oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry) 7.Blood sugar (bedside glucose), which providesan immediate value for situations including analtered LOC, a diabetic with the likelihood ofabnormally high or low glucose, or when glucoseis the only blood test necessary 8.Pain score (from 0-10, or happy-sad faces scale), repeated frequently and afterinterventions as indicated 9.GCS (best eye opening, verbal, and motorresponses) or other methods which measureLOC or mental status, such as AVPU or mini-mental status examination 10.Visual acuity (for orneurologic complaints) 11.ETCO 2for intubated patients 12.Fetal heart tones (for pregnant patients) AVPU: alertness, verbal response, pain response, unresponsive. BP: blood pressure.ETCO 2:end-tidal carbon dioxide. GCS: Glasgow Coma Scale.LOC: level of consciousness.Table 1.6 12 Vital signs to considerBe gentle Do not proceed immediately to the area of pain, and do not palpate a tender area using morepressure than is absolutely necessary. If possible,try to distract patients while you examine apainful area. This is especially true for pediatricpatients. Always examine the joints above andbelow an injured area, as other injuries may coexist due to transmitted forces. Remove all con-stricting jewelry and clothing distal to an injured area, as swelling due to dependent edema islikely to occur. Patients may not appre ciate this gesture at the time, but it will be valuable in terms of patient safety and preventing damage to anitem that may require removal later. Be sensitive Make patients aware that you are focused on them during your examination, not on otherpatients or problems. Furthermore, let patientsbriefly know what you find immediately follow-ing each phase of the examination. There is noreason to do your entire examination and then tell the patient that it was normal. Share withpatients that their heart or lungs sound fine rightafter auscultation. If patients have abnormal find-ings, they may have been aware of these from aprevious physician's examination. Ask if they hadbeen aware of this finding, without accusing thephysician of missing something if they had notbeen told. When appropriate, let them knowimmediately that it is not dangerous or worrisomeif this is the case. There is no reason to increasetheir anxiety by telling them they have a heartmurmur if it is inconsequential. Offering findingsin this manner increases patients' confidence inyour abilities, because you were able to identify aheart murmur (for example) that they already knew existed. Be thorough This is important so that critical findings or other clues to the patient's final diagnosis are notmissed. For example, lacerations, contusions,rashes, or bruises might imply spouse abuse. If itmay be relevant to the presenting complaint,expose the patient's skin during the examinationof the body region. Rashes may be present whichidentify life-threatening infectious diseases ormay eliminate the need for further diagnosticstudies (e.g., meningococcemia or herpes zoster).Be thoughtful Use language that patients and family members understand. It does not impress patients whenphysicians use technical jargon to look smart. Ifpatients are not familiar with abbreviations orterms that you have used, they may not be com-fortable asking for their meaning. For example,despite the common use of the abbreviation \"MI\"for myocardial infarction, many people do notknow what it means. You may tell a patient that hehad an MI, only to be asked later if he suffered aheart attack. In children, consider efforts to involveparents with the examination, such as looking ina parent's throat or ear first. Other skills to usewhen examining children include letting thechild touch your stethoscope or otoscope beforeusing it. Involve older children in the examina-tion by asking which ear they would prefer beexamined first. Recognize that hospital gownsare not flattering; it is a kind gesture to assist apatient by offering to tie his or her gown, espe-cially if they are going to leave their ED gurney. Be efficient An entire physical examination does not need to be done on every patient. For example, a fundus-copic examination does not need to be performedon a patient presenting with an ankle injury.Furthermore, examine patients starting with theposition they are in, rather than from head-to-toe,which can save time. For example, if the patientis supine in the gurney, consider examining their abdomen befor etheir lungs. Differential diagnosis Following the history and physical examination,with careful review of the vital signs, a differen-tial diagnosis should be established. This differ-ential diagnosis should be as comprehensive aspossible, as it suggests which diagnostic testsshould be obtained, and in which order. This dif-ferential diagnosis also establishes which thera-peutic approaches should be initiated, if they havenot already begun. Diagnostic testing Diagnostic testing in the ED is performed toinclude (\"rule in\") or exclude (\"rule out\") condi-tions responsible for the patient's symptoms. Assuch, it is imperative that EPs have a sense of Approach to the emergency patient 10 Principles of Emergency Medicinepretest probability, which includes disease preva- lence, and the se nsitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of thetests they are ordering. It is important to befamiliar with likelihood and odds ratios as well. Laboratory studies Because of the time pressures for patient dispos-itions, many tests have been or are being devel-oped which can be done at the bedside, to decreasethe turnaround time for results. Known as\"point-of-care\" testing, one classic example is thebedside glucose test. Numerous implications ofthis rising technology's role in EM have beenstudied. Current research using new bedsidetests of cardiac markers and other tests of cardiacfunction is ongoing. Treadmill tests on low-riskcardiac patients have been performed from (orin) the ED to risk-stratify patients regarding theirneed for hospitalization. Bedside ultrasonogra-phy is a similar test being utilized by EPs withincreased frequency to assist with patient diag-nosis, treatment, and disposition. As more hospi-tals and EDs subscribe to these concepts, andmore physicians gain skills in these areas, thesetests will assume an even greater role in the eval- uation and treatment of emergency patients. Unfortunately, regulations have removed manytests from the ED that were previously performedthere, such as pregnancy tests and microscopicevaluation of vaginal flora. Having these testsdone in a laboratory increases the time to receiveresults, if for no other reason than sample trans- port time. The implications of increased laboratoryturnaround time are enormous given ED closures,lack of ED and hospital bed availability, andincreased patient volumes in EDs across the US. Some tests are being ordered or performed by certified nurses during the triage process, aspatients register for evaluation by EPs. Thesetests include urine collection to screen for preg-nancy, blood, or infection, ECGs to evaluate car-diac function, and radiographs. There has beenextensive research to develop rules to assisthealth professionals with determining a patient'sneed for an X-ray. If these clinical criteria are met,trained nurses in many institutions may order X-rays from the triage area in an effort to stream-line care and reduce overall patient time in theED. Examples of some rules found in the litera-ture include the Ottawa ankle, knee, and footrules, the Pittsburgh knee rule, the Nexus rule for cervical spine radiographs, and several headcomputed tomography (CT) rules. Depending onthe situation, nurses generally use the extremityrules in their practice, while physicians apply the C-spine and head CT rules. Some EDs have aphysician or nurse order necessary blood testsand send them to the lab from the triage area, inan effort to improve patient throughput. Electrocardiography With ECGs, it is a good idea to obtain old ECGs whenever possible to allow comparison with thenew (current) ECG. This is of particular impor-tance in patients with abnormal conduction,abnormal intervals, or abnormal ST and T wavesegments. ECGs should be repeated in the ED ifpatients develop chest pain or if their chest painresolves, whether spontaneously or following intervention. The importance of serial ECGs can-not be overemphasized in the setting of ACS, orif the possibility of a cardiac etiology for chest painis entertained. ECGs are invaluable in patientswith acute ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI), asthe determination for thrombolysis or percuta-neous coronary intervention (PCI) is time-sensitivefrom the time of the first diagnostic ECG. They alsoserve as useful adjuncts in the evaluation of sev-eral toxic ingestions or presenting symptomssuch as weakness, dizziness, abdominal pain, back pain, confusion, or alterations of mental status. Radiologic studies Regarding the use of radiology in diagnostic test-ing, physicians seem to rely on imaging to agreater extent than they did years ago. This is duein part to the greater role imaging plays in patientcare, the increased availability of CT scanners, themanner in which physicians are currently trained,and the increased concern over litigation. Never-theless, obtaining radiologic imaging (especiallyCT) has become a standard that physicians must recognize, and that patients often demand. Not ordering radiologic studies to identify certainconditions may be indefensible, as these tests aresensitive, specific, a nd readily available 24 hours a day in nearly all EDs. The development of guide-lines to help determine which patients require X-rays has provided physicians the ability to safelyreduce the number of radiographs ordered. EPs use bedside ultrasonography as part of their phys-ical examination skill set in many hospitals, often with the support of radiology. This situation arose out of the need for EPs to have ultrasound avail-able to their patients on a 24-hour basis, to identifyhemoperitoneum following abdominal trauma, Principles of Emergency Medicine 11Approach to the emergency patientgallbladder disease, cardiac tamponade, ectopic pregnancy, or other illnesses. EPs first used bed-side ultrasonography for the focused assess-ment with sonography for trauma (FAST) exam. Tremendous success with this limited use encour- aged EPs to incorporate ultrasound technologyinto other necessary areas of their clinical practice.It is important for both EPs and radiologists towork collaboratively in this area, keeping patient advocacy and safety the first priority at all times. General treatment principles When evaluating and treating patients present- ing to the ED, it is imperative to address life-threats first. A tremendous amount of informationcan be obtained from the patient's generalappearance, vital signs, and history of presentingillness (HPI). This is essentially a less than oneminute assessment. stratification into \"sick\"or \"not sick,\" or \"stable\" or \"unstable\" is part ofthis process. Attention to the airway, breathing,and circulation (ABCs) is critical, as is having thecorrect personnel, equipment, and monitorsavailable. Much of this process occurs simultane-ously, often automatically, with more than onehealth care provider involved in a patient's care.While nurses are measuring vital signs, connect-ing patients to monitors, and starting peripheralintravenous (IV) catheters for blood draw andcirculation access, physicians can be interveningwith airway management and assessing breathingand circulation. In trauma patients, the mnemonicA-B-C-D-E-F-G is addressed in the primary andsecondary surveys (Table 1.7). Cervical spine immobilization and protection is part of this process. \"F\" also reminds us of theimportance of family and friends. They may pro-vide information about the circumstances leadingup to the present condition, and should be keptupdated as much as possible. When caring forpediatric patients, current literature demonstratesthat family members' presence during resuscita-tion efforts or invasive procedures is extremelyimportant to them, provided their presence doesnot interfere with medical care delivery. At times, histories and physical examinations must be abbreviated and more focused than onemight prefer. This is often a necessary part of EMpractice. Treatment may need to be initiated based on limited information, previous episodes, physi-cian experience, or physician speculation. In trueemergencies, assessment and treatment occursimultaneously. It may be necessary to determinea patient's resuscitation status in an instant,which is extremely difficult for EPs. As quicklyas possible, attempts should be made to learnthis information from the patient, prehospitalcare providers, family members, nursing homeor skilled facilities. Having a system in placewith electronic medical records or a designatedindividual (social services, ED tech, or nurse)available to make calls may save precious min-utes. When in doubt, always do what is med-ically indicated for the patient, rather than makingassumptions that may be incorrect. Remember todo no harm, and always relieve pain, suffering,and anxiety. Adequate pain control is an important element of EM practice. If a patient has a painful condi-tion, it is good practice to address issues of paincontrol as early as possible. This is true not onlyfor patients presenting with abdominal pain, butin patients with traumatic injuries who wouldbenefit from adequate analgesia. Waiting toadminister pain medication to a patient with aclinical fracture until after the X-ray is reviewed isinappropriate. As previously mentioned, reassesspatients after each intervention, whether follow-ing intubation for airway control or the adminis-tration of analgesia. Continued reassessment ofall patients, particularly the sickest or those atgreatest risk for decompensation, is critical. All patients should be treated sensitively, with attention paid to their fears and anxieties. Patientsdon't wish to be in the ED, where privacy con-cerns, noises, and discomfort predominate. Theywould much rather be at home, without pain, orin a familiar physician's office. In this sense, EPsand EDs start out with strikes against them. Addto this the long wait, the uncertainty, and thelikelihood that someone will be less than pleas-ant results in an emergency experience rarelyseen favorably by patients. Respectful treatment, Approach to the emergency patient 12 Principles of Emergency MedicineAAirway BBreathing CCirculation DDisability (neurologic) EExposure FFoley (following and rectal examination) GGastric decompression (provided no contraindications exist)Table 1.7 A-B-C-D-E-F-G mnemonic for trauma patientswithout discrimination or condescension, should be integral to our approach towards all patients. ACEP and other organizations have developed a number of clinical policies by consensus in anattempt to improve patient care and reduce med-ical error. Although many EPs feel that thesepolicies might be used against them in litigation,or are an attempt to standardize patient care,these policies are established using research andopinion and are an excellent resource. This isespecially true for challenging conditions or thosewith unclear or rapidly changing diagnostic andtreatment approaches. These policies are generallyavailable from these organizations at no charge.Many similar treatment guidelines may be foundon-line to assist providers with an evidence-basedmedicine (EBM) approach to patient care. Special patients Elderly Individuals over 85 years of age are the fastestgrowing segment of the population. Withadvances in medical care, and the increasingimportance placed on disease prevention, dietand exercise, this portion of the population willcontinue to grow at a tremendous rate. The spe-cial needs of this group of patients are often sig-nificant. It has been repeatedly established thatthe majority of medical care expenses are spenton the geriatric population during their last fewyears of life. Geriatric patients are at risk for falls,functional decline, changes in cognition, as wellas cardiac, pulmonary, and vascular emergencies.They have reduced physiologic reserve, and oftenare too ill, weak, or complicated to use medicaloffices for even routine care. As such, many relyon EDs for their overall health care, assumingthey get any care at all. When geriatric patientspresent to the ED, they ar e far more likely to be admitted to the hospital than younger patients. They are also far more likely to require socialservices if discharged. The best solution is to inte-grate social services into the care of all geriatric patients. EPs should consider why social servicesshould notbe asked to see an elderly patient in the ED, as they can offer home safety checks,access to meals, transportation to medical appoint- ments, and address social isolation, depression,financial security, and common feelings of beinga burden to family members. Furthermore, elderneglect or abuse is far more prevalent thanreported. From a social perspective, geriatric patients prefer being referred to as \"young\"rather than \"old\" (as in 75 years young), and pre-fer being referred to as \"older\" rather than \"old.\" Many medical conditions in older patients do not present as they might in a younger or healthierpatient. A UTI in an elderly patient often presentswith confusion, as might ACS or a pulmonaryinfection. Many geriatric patients are not able tomount a febrile response to sepsis or infections.In fact, geriatric patients are often hypothermicwhen septic. As a result, rectal temperaturesshould be measured in this population. Geriatricpatients commonly use over-the-counter med-ications, increasing their risk of adverse drugreactions. On average, elderly patients take 5 prescription medications daily. Polypharmacy isa frequent concern in the geriatric population,increasing the likelihood of drug-drug interac-tions. Primary providers are often unaware of allmedications their elderly patients take, as physi-cian colleagues, consultants, and urgent careproviders may prescribe additional medicationswithout them knowing. Prehospital personnelshould be encouraged to bring all medicationbottles with patients to the ED so they can bereviewed. This may help identify possible adverse drug reactions or interactions. Many drugs inter-act with warfarin, commonly prescribed in thegeriatric population. Special ID bracelets shouldbe provided to and worn by elderly patients,which should include select medical conditions,addresses, contacts, medications, and allergies. Eyesight often fails in the geriatric population, so it is important to check this and consider out- patient referrals to optometry. Difficulties witheyesight may result in the inability to read food ormedication instructions, especially insulin doses. Difficulty with vision in low light makes it nearlyimpossible for elderly patients to reliably com-ment on their stools turning darker (hema-tochezia or melena). Driving abilities may beimpaired by visual difficulties or by neck arthri-tis (which makes it difficult to change lanes),muscle power (required for defensive maneu-vers), or fine motor control and coordination.Driving is of vital importance for independence,and is therefore a skill that many elderly do notwish to relinquish. Falls are more common in the elderly, not only because of visual difficulties but also because oftheir diminished ability to avoid objects, climbstairs, or maintain balance and posture. As finan-cial issues are of great concern, medications may not be taken regu larly or may be cut in half to decrease the cost. The same goes for food - soupsare inexpensive and easy to cook, although many Principles of Emergency Medicine 13Approach to the emergency patienthave high sodium contents. A dietician or nutri- tionist can discuss healthy eating habits with eld-erly patients. Plans for assisted living or skilledfacilities should be addressed with geriatricpatients before the need is imminent, as should advance directives and powers of attorney. Evena discussion of wills and plans for death shouldbe addressed, although this is best done at ascheduled time in the primary care provider'soffice. Postal ca rriers and apartment managers are particularly important to the safety of the eld- erly population who live alone, as they can checkto see that the mail is being picked up daily,make sure that the individual has eaten or gottenup that morning, or provide brief social contact.These resources can be investigated by socialworkers. Pediatric Pediatric patients often make up a high percent-age of patient visits to an ED, especially at nightwhen pediatric clinics are closed. Many EDs haveseparate patient care and waiting room areas forpediatric patients, so they are not as frightenedduring their visit. Some EDs have special pediatricrooms with colors and decorations to improve these patient's experience. Coloring books, stick-ers, and stuffed animals may be helpful as well.It is inadvisable to have a belligerent patientsharing a room with a child (or any patient, forthat matter). This may not be possible, however,given the demands for ED space during timeswhen patient volumes are increased and pediatricpatients are most likely to present. EDs shouldhave a resuscitation area especially for children,using colors for equipment storage matching thoseon the Broselow resuscitation tape. Pediatric patients are generally evaluated with parents, which may help the evaluation or makeit more difficult. It is important to observe themanner in which children interact with their par-ents. Physical, emotional, and sexual abuse orneglect should be considered in allpediatric vis- its, especially cases of traumatic injury, genitouri-nary complaints, or failure to thrive. At times,therefore, it may be necessary to have a discus-sion with a pediatric patient without a parentpresent. If this situation is necessary, it is advis-able to have a second health care professional,preferably of the same gender as the patient, inthe room with you. Every attempt should bemade to minimize a child's time away from hisor her parent or guardian unless this separationis warranted. Parents are often concerned abouttheir child's fever, but their true concern may bemeningitis or some other serious infection. Withas much certainty as possible, these concernsshould be addressed. Pediatric patients with ven-triculoperitoneal (VP) shunts, leukemias, cancers,cardiac or lung disease, transplants, seizur edis- orders, or other specialized conditions are gener-ally closely followed by their pediatricians orpediatric specialists, who should be included inor informed of care decisions. As younger pedi- atric patients are at risk for serious bacterial illness(SBI) and have less reserve than older children or adults, close follow-up of patients and cultures (if obtained) should be encouraged according tohospital practices, as patients in this age groupcan become extremely sick or dehydrated quickly. Drug-seekers The practice of EM has a set of unique patientswho use and abuse the ED. Patients who seekdrugs, whether they are drug-addicted, drug-dependent, or in constant pain are commonpatients seen after clinic hours or when primaryphysicians are unavailable. Some of these patients may simply have decreased abilities to toleratepain. Many hospitals and EDs have policies aboutproviding narcotic medication to drug-seekingpatients, or patients who have abused the sys-tem. It is far easier for administrators to writepolicies for such patients than for EPs to applythem in clinical practice. Whatever the outcome,it is always the best practice to be sensitive to thatpatient's condition. There have been several situ-ations in which denying narcotics to a patientdemanding them resulted in injury to or evendeath of health care providers. Referrals to painclinics, psychiatry, narcotics anonymous, andsocial services are always appropriate but rarelyhelpful. Difficult patients Patients with personality disorders, malingerers,manipulators, litigious patients, and patientswith behavioral problems often use the ED fortheir health care, as they may not have insuranceor may not be able to access clinics. These patientsare particularly challenging to the staff's patience.Federal law prohibits EDs from turning awaypatients, without at least preforming a medicalscreening examination (MSE) to evaluate for anyemergency medical condition (EMC). At times,security personnel or the police may need to be Approach to the emergency patient 14 Principles of Emergency Medicineinvolved with these challenging patients. In our role as health care's safety net physicians, we must interact with these unique and challengingpatients on a regular basis given the ED's open-door policy. An EP's goal is to treat these patientswith respect, set strict limits, refer aggressively,and recognize other factors that may be influenc-ing their behavior. Conditions such as reflex sym-pathetic dystr ophy, fibromyalgia, post-herpetic neuralgia, claudication, or psychosocial condi tions such as abuse may not have been considered byother physicians during past visits. Frequent flyers Patients labeled as \"frequent flyers\" may or maynot have addictions to narcotics or psychiatric ill-nesses, although they often do. However, isol-ation, homelessness, boredom, mental illness, orsearching for attention and care may be reasonsfor repeat visits. Despite overutilizing the ED,these individuals should be treated respectfully.Many medical staff fear that nice treatment willencourage repeat visits, but providing a meal ora warm place to sit for a short time may be neces-sary regardless of the number of visits. Abuse ofthe prehospital care syst em is even more upset- ting to many emergency medical personnel, asthe number of available ambulances and prehos-pital providers decrease during attention to theseindividuals. However, it is always possible thatfrequent flyers have or will have real illness. Itmay be necessary to focus evaluations and mini-mize testing, although studies often are per-formed despite the high likelihood of beingnegative. The use of derisive or condescendinglanguage to individuals who abuse the medicalsystem is never acceptable. Respectfully address-ing their abuse of the system and its impact onothers is certainly warranted. When possible, EDor hospital administrators should be notified ofthese abuses using mechanisms in place. Police custody Sadly, patients in police custody who need med-ical attention for evaluation and treatment haveno place to go other than the ED (occasionally,some urgent care centers have contractual agree-ments for this). Often, police bring patients to theED for medical clearance. This requires an EP toattempt to determine whether or not the patient'sactions can be explained by a medical (or psychi-atric) condition. Patients often come to the ED inpolice custody with injuries following an alterca-tion, often with a police officer or officers. Thisestablishes a difficult context for EPs becauseofficers may have injured certain patients inresponse to their aggressive behavior. If the EP feels safe, he or she should interview patientsoutside of police presence. It is always difficult tofeel comfortable evaluating patients handcuffedto gurneys, with or without police present.However, a thorough yet cautious evaluation forinjuries, including contusions, bruises, marks,scratches, abrasions, and bites must be per-formed and documented. Patients may be placedinto police custody from the ED if they are vio-lent, abusive, stealing supplies, or exhibitinginappropriate behavior. Police must be notifiedabout all violent injuries, and may place patientsin custody or take them from the ED to jail. Policeoften deliver intoxicated patients to an ED sothey can sober before going to jail. Patients whoare intoxicated may have additional reasons forcombative behavior or altered mental status,including traumatic brain injury or other medicalconditions, thus mandating a thorough evalu-ation. Intoxicated patients may be released to thecare of the EP and medical staff if they havecooperated with the police and are not underarrest. When this occurs, careful observation untildaylight hours, a meal if possible, and carefulplans for disposition, follow-up, and referralshould be discussed with a non-intoxicated fam-ily member or friend. Clearly, a close workingrelationship between fire, police, and emergency personnel is crucial to our safety and success. Disposition Consultation Dealing with consultants is an art that is oftendifficult. Consultants respect straightforward,focused, and well-planned presentations with adirect question or goal being clearly stated. Theymay not appreciate being told what to do, such as\"this patient needs to go to the operating room.\"Any ED consultation is unplanned work for aconsultant. Reimbursement issues may negativelyimpact consultants to a far greater extent thanmost EPs recognize. Despite such issues, EPs mustserve as their patient's advocate at all times. EPsshould never do something that makes themuncomfortable, even if a consultant recommendsit. This is especially true if a consultant does not formally evaluate the patient. Disagreementsabout the best plan of action for patients are Principles of Emergency Medicine 15Approach to the emergency patientcommon. These may be due to financial, time, or hospital pressures. In general, consultants do notwish to hospitalize patients who, in their opinion,do not need admission. Since EPs do not wish tosend patients home who, in their opinion, shouldnot be discharged, conflict may be inherent tothis interaction. As always, keep the patient'sbest interests in mind. Consider alternate optionssuch as holding patients in the ED until the nextconsultant comes on duty, finding a differentservice to admit the patient, enlisting the assis-tance of social services, admitting the patient toan observation unit (either in the ED or the hos-pital), or recognizing that it may be safe to sendthat particular patient home despite your initialimpression. If absolutely needed, EPs can alwayscontact the chief of service, administrator on call,or chief of staff for truly unacceptable situations.When possible, notifying a patient's primaryphysician or specialist with information abouthis or her visit, evaluation, laboratory results,and treatment plan is uniformly appreciated,and is in the patient's best interest. Not only doesthis serve as an opportunity for continued care, italso assists in transferring care for that patient.Follow-up notification by EPs to patient's physi-cians earns additional respect for our specialty,and is a fantastic way to let other physicians knowthat we care about their (our) patients. If inter-ested, request follow-up from these physicians tolearn about patient care outcomes. Serial evaluation Repeat evaluation of patients is an importantaspect of emergency care, as a patient's conditionmay change over a period of time. Many presen-tations warrant repeat evaluation, includinghead or traumatic injuries, seizures, hypo-glycemic episodes, abdominal pain, shortness ofbreath, and chest pain, to list a few. Time alonemay allow a diagnosis to become more apparentor declare itself, or may lead to the resolution ofsymptoms. It is critical that patients who areimpaired (drug or alcohol intoxication, alteredmental status, or confused) or are restrained(chemical, physical, or both) have frequent andrepeated evaluations by both physicians and nurses. Serial evaluation is necessary followinginterventions, such as the administration ofnitroglycerin (NTG), analgesics, bronchodilators,or anxiolytics. This is important not only todetermine the patient's response to that interven-tion, as many interventions are diagnostic as wellas therapeutic, but also helps determine if anadditional or different intervention is needed.Documentation of this response to therapy isimportant, as it records the patient's ED course.Repeat evaluations of patients after importantlaboratory or X-ray results become available,and/or before they are discharged is recom-mended, although the extent of this reevaluationdiffers with each clinical scenario. Admission/discharge The decision to admit or discharge patients fromthe ED is perhaps the most challenging part ofEM practice. Multiple factors must be consideredin this decision, including psychosocial, biological,medicolegal, and, unfortunately, financial. Whenpossible, a patient's wishes should be included inthis decision. With the advent of more aggressiveoutpatient strategies (low-molecular-weightheparin for DVT, longer-acting antibiotics withgreater potency) and research suggesting similaroutcomes in selected patients, many patients pre-viously hospitalized are now being safely treatedas outpatients with close follow-up. Many dispos-ition differences exist between hospitals for certainconditions; it is a good idea for EPs to familiarizethemselves with hospital or community prac tices. In smaller hospitals, EPs may be responsible forwriting admission orders for patients. AlthoughEM organizations discourage this practice, it stilloccurs. Admission orders written by EPs shouldclearly transfer care to the admitting physicianupon the patient's arrival to the floor. The nursesshould be instructed to notify the admitting phys-ician upon the patient's arrival, if the patient has any special needs, or for any change in vital signs,including pain. Unstable or particularly complexpatients should remain in the ED until the admit-ting physician has the opportunity to evaluatethem. In some hospitals, EPs on duty are respon-sible to respond to in-hospital medical emergen-cies. Hospital or ED policies should set guidelinesto define the circumstances under which the EPcan (and cannot) respond to acute medical caresituations within the hospital. Similarly, hospitalpolicies should address acceptable time stand-ards for admitting physicians to evaluate theirpatients so they are not held in the ED for extendedperiods. For patients being discharged, clear and legible discharge instructions should encouragepatients to return if their symptoms get worse,change, or don't improve. All discharge instruc-tions should include 4 categories of instructions:(1) what to do, (2) what not to do, (3) when (and Approach to the emergency patient 16 Principles of Emergency Medicinewhere) to follow-up, and (4) reasons to return to the ED. What to do includes instructions such as rest, ice, compression, and elevation for an ankle injury. What not to do instructions might include don't smoke, don't drive, don't stop your anti-biotics until completed or instructed by yourphysician. When (and where) to follow-up for re-evaluation, and with whom, is beneficial infor- mation for dischar ged patients. The time frame for follow-up should directly relate to the cer-tainty of the diagnosis and the likelihood of theillness or injury degenerating to a critical condi-tion. Close follow-up is important for all patientswith high-risk medical conditions. The ideal situ-ation is to schedule a follow-up appointment forthe patient at the time of his or her discharge.Give the patient this follow-up physician's name,the date and time of the appointment, and theaddress with directions to the clinic. Perhaps themost important discharge instruction is the list ofreasons to return to the ED. These might include but are not limited to any increase in pain, new ordifferent pain, worsening of symptoms, inabilityto take medications or fluids, allergic reactions toany medications, fever, vomiting, bleeding, or anyother concerns or fears. Pre-printed dischargeinstruction sheets are helpful if they are writtenin a language that the patient can understand.These may allow EPs to be more efficient. How-ever, patients deserve personalized instructionsas well, as each patient is an individual, not a dis-ease or set of symptoms. Assisting patients with filling their prescrip- tions at discharge is important, although thisdoes not ensure compliance. If this is not pos-sible, discharging patients with one day's supplyof medication is a reasonable gesture. Testing apatient's gait prior to discharge helps determinetheir balance, coordination, and likelihood ofsuccess at home. If a patient walked in to the ED,or \"should be able to walk,\" then this patientshould be able to walk at discharge. Patientsshould be discharged to a safe environment,preferably in the company of a responsible adultwho also understands the discharge instructions.If they have been in the ED for an extendedperiod, providing a meal is appropriate, as theymay be too ill or tired to prepare one for them-selves upon returning home. Wheelchairs maybe used to assist patients to their cars. Patientsshould not drive if they might be distracted, weregiven medication that may interfere with driving,or presented with a lapse of consciousness thatmay recur without warning. In this last situation,a report must be filed with the appropriateauthorities, and the patient needs to be informedthat this has occurred. They should not drive untilan appropriate physician and the proper author-ities approve this at a follow-up appointment.Rides home, often paid for by the ED or hospital,may be necessary, as might a clean or warm set ofclothes. Clothing donated by the medical staff orother sources for patients to use is one option ifthe hospital budget does not allow for this. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Always address life-threats first, including patientand staff safety. An exact diagnosis is not always possible in EM, and not always necessary. Often, an appropri-ate disposition, such as admission to a monitoredbed, intensive care unit (ICU), operating room,skilled nursing facility, or discharge home withclose follow-up is the best that can be expected. Always attempt to get the appropriate service or consultant involved. Make every effort toinform a patient's primary care provider aboutthe circumstances leading up to the patient's EDvisit, the care provided while there, laboratoryand X-ray results, and a suggested follow-up plan. Not all is what is seems; expect the unex- pected, or you won't find it. Consider alternativediagnoses and the possibility of lab error or falsenegative (or positive) test results if things don'tseem as expected. Repeat tests if the original testresult doesn't \"fit\" with what you expected. Be wary about the wrong test results being placedon the wrong patient's chart, or a laboratoryspecimen or radiograph being mislabeled,improperly marked, or incorrectly collected. People with psychiatric illness may have med- ical illnesses too. Consider ingestions, or cardiac,metabolic, infectious, and CNS derangements as well. Many elderly patients have uncommon pre- sentations for common conditions, such as ACSor sepsis. Furthermore, polypharmacy and drug-drug interactions should be considered, alongwith elder abuse, neglect, and depression (includ-ing suicidal gesture or attempt). Consider the safety of an elderly patient being discharged, andalways remain his or her advocate. Never rush a patient out of the ED with a con- dition that may recur, such as asthma, seizures,chest pain, breathing difficulty, or alteration of con-sciousness (following head trauma or intoxicants). Be sensitive, sit with patients, make good eye contact, and listen well for apparent as well as Principles of Emergency Medicine 17Approach to the emergency patienthidden issues. Hidden issues may not be the ones initially offered by patients, as they maywait to gain your trust before sharing. Review nursing and EMS notes on all patients. Look for hidden clues that the patient may notoffer or tell you. Enlist the assistance of others tohelp you with patient care, including nursing,family, EMS, social services, consultants, or apatient's primary care physician. Poison centersand on-line resources may be extremely valuableas well. Use caution in patients with language or cul- tural barriers. Translators and family membersmay not provide complete or accurate informa-tion, details which you might have been able toelicit if these barriers did not exist. This is espe-cially true for patients who are deaf or have speechimpediments. Think about abuse or neglect in every case. If you aren't thinking about it, you will notuncover it. Document clear and appropriate findings in the medical record, including repeat examinations,laboratory results and radiograph interpretations,discussions with consultants or primary providers,and discharge instructions. Documenting the timeand consultant's name with whom you spoke isalways helpful. Consider dangerous outcomes or the worst- case scenario in every patient. Minimize the like-lihood of these outcomes with appropriatelyfocused histories, physical examinations, labora-tory and radiograph ordering and interpretation,and disposition. Never do something you are notcomfortable with, despite a consultant's recom-mendation. Enjoy the privilege of providing emergency care to all patients. References 1.American Hospital Association.

Approach to the emergency patient 18 Principles of Emergency MedicineScope of the problem Airway management is arguably the single most important skill taught to and possessed by emer-gency physicians. It represents the \"A\" of themnemonic ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation),which forms the foundation for the resuscitationof critically ill and injured patients. Airway man-agement encompasses the assessment, establish-ment and protection of the airway in combinationwith effective oxygenation and ventilation. Timelyeffective airway management can mean the dif-ference between life and death, and takes prece-dence over all other clinical considerations withthe sole exception of immediate defibrillation ofthe patient in cardiac arrest due to ventricularfibrillation. This chapter reviews airway anatomy and assessment, approaches for noninvasive airwaymanagement, and indications and techniques fordefinitive airway management. The approach tothe challenging patient with a difficult or failedairway will also be explored, as well as specializeddevices, techniques and medications employedin these challenging clinical situations. Anatomic essentials Aclear understanding of airway anatomy is requisite for advanced airway management. Internally, the airway is made up of many struc-tures and well-defined spaces. It originates at thenasal and oral cavities (Figure 2.1). The nasal cav- ityextends from the nostrils to the posterior nares or choana. The nasopharynx extends from the end of the nasal cavity to the level of the softpalate. The oral cavity is bounded by the teeth anteriorly, hard and soft palate superiorly andthe tongue inferiorly. The oropharynx , which com- municates with the oral cavity and nasopharynx, extends from the soft palate to the tip of theepiglottis. The oropharynx continues as the laryn- gopharynx (hypopharynx ), which extends from the irway management inletValleculaOropharynxNasopharynx Laryngopharynx Figure 2.1 Lateral view of airway anatomy.Airway management 20 Principles of Emergency Medicineepiglottis to the upper border of the cricoid cartil- age (level of the C6 vertebral body). The larynx lies between the laryngopharynx and trachea. The flexible epiglottis , which originates from the hyoid bone and the base of the tongue, coversthe glottis during swallowing and protects theairway from aspiration. During laryngoscopy,the epiglottis serves as an important landmarkfor airway identification and laryngoscope pos-itioning (Figure 2.2). The vallecula is the space at the base of the tongue formed posteriorly by theepiglottis and (b) Figure 2.2 (a) Position of laryngoscope blade when using a curved blade (b) Operator'sview of anatomy. Reproduced with permission, PALS Provider Manual, \u00a92002, Copyright American Heart Association.Principles of Emergency Medicine 21Airway managementwall. The laryngeal inlet is the opening to the lar- ynx bounded by the epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds and arytenoid cartilages. The glottis is the vocal apparatus, including the true and falsevocal cords and the glottic opening. The glottic opening is the opening into the trachea (as seen from above) through the vocal cords, and liesinferior and posterior to the epiglottis. Externally, specific identifiable landmarks are important to airway assessment and manage-ment (Figure 2.3). The mentum is the anterior aspect of the mandible and represents the tip ofthe chin. The hyoid bone forms the base of the floor of the mouth. The thyroid cartilage forms the laryngeal prominence (\"Adam's apple\") and thy-roidnotch. The cricoid cartilage , lying inferior to the thyroid cartilage, forms a complete ring thatprovides structural support to the lower airway.The cricothyroid membrane lies between the thyroid and cricoid cartilage, and serves as an importantsite for surgical airway management. Initial airway assessment The initial assessment of airway patency and respiratory function focuses on determining: 1.whether the airway is open and protected; 2.if breathing is present and adequate.This is carefully achieved through inspection,auscultation and palpation. The patient should be observed for objective signs of airway compromise. Agitation may represent hypoxia, obtundation suggests hyper- carbia, and cyanosis indicates hypoxemia. The respiratory rate and pattern are important. Bradypnea or tachypnea may be signs of impending respiratory compromise. Respira-tory muscle fatigue may result in the recruitmentof accessory muscles of respiration, clinicallymanifested as suprasternal, supraclavicular or intercostal retractions. Look for a symmetrical rise and fall of the chest. A significant traumaticinjury to the chest may result in paradoxical or discordant chest wall movement. The presence or absence and quality of speech may be used to identify airway abnormalities. Anormal voice suggests that the airway is adequate for the moment. Stridor , a high-pitched inspiratory sound, may be associated with partialairway obstruction at the level of the larynx(inspiratory stridor) or the trachea (expiratorystridor). Snoring usually indicates partial airwayobstruction at the pharyngeal level, while hoarse-ness suggests a laryngeal process. Aphonia in the conscious patient is an extremely worrisome sign;a patient who is too short of breath to speak is ingrave danger of impending respiratory collapse. Hyoid bone Thyroid membrane Thyroid notch Laryngeal prominence Thyroid cartilage Cricothyroid membrane Cricoid cartilage Thyroid glandTracheal rings Figure 2.3 External airway anatomy.The central face and mandible should be inspected and palpated for structural integrity; injuries to these structures may lead to airwaydistortion or loss. The anterior neck should becarefully inspected for penetrating wounds, asym-metry or swelling that may herald impending air- way compromise. The palpation of subcutaneousair suggests a direct airway injury. Feel for air movement at the mouth and nose. Open the mouth and inspect the upper airway,taking care not to extend or rotate the neck. Lookfor and remove any vomitus, blood or other for-eign material. Identify swelling of the tongue oruvula, sites of bleeding, or other visible abnormal-ities of the oropharynx. Gentle use of a tongue blade may facilitate this task. The patient's abilityto spontaneously swallow and handle secretionsis an important indicator of intact protective air-way mechanisms. In the unconscious patient, theabsence of a gag reflex has traditionally beenassociated with loss of protective airway reflexes. Auscultation should demonstrate clear and equal breath sounds. Diminished breath soundsmay be the result of pneumothorax, hemothoraxor pleural effusion. Wheezing and dyspnea implylower airway obstruction. In pediatric patients, visual signs of possible airway and respiratory compromise includetachypnea, cyanosis, drooling, nasal flaring andintercostal retractions. A child with severe upperairway obstruction may get in to the \"sniffingposition\" to straighten the airway and reduceocclusion. A child with severe lower airwayobstruction may assume the \"tripod\" posture -sitting up and leaning forward on outstretchedarms - to augment accessory muscle function. Noninvasive airway management Opening the airway Ensuring airway patency is essential for adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and is the first pri-ority in airway control. The conscious patientuses the musculature of the upper airway tomaintain patency, and protective reflexes to pro-tect against aspiration of foreign substances, gas-tric contents or secretions. In the severely ill,compromised or unconscious patient, these pro-tective airway mechanisms may be impaired or lost. Upper airway obstruction in the unconscious patient is most commonly the result of posteriordisplacement of the tongue and epiglottis at thelevel of the pharynx and larynx. This occlusionresults directly from loss of submandibular mus- cle tone, which provides direct support to the tongue and indirect support to the epiglottis. Simple bedside maneuvers can correct this occlusion and reestablish airway patency andairflow. The head tilt with chin lift (Figure 2.4) is a simple, effective technique for opening the air-way, but should be avoided in any patient with apotentially unstable cervical spine. The jaw thrust without head tilt (Figure 2.5), however, can be per- formed while maintaining cervical spine align-ment. Although these techniques work well, theyrequire the continuous involvement of a single provider to maintain airway patency. Airway management 22 Principles of Emergency Medicine Figure 2.4 Head tilt with chin lift. Figure 2.5Jaw thrust without head tilt.Several airway adjuncts have been developed to maintain airway patency while freeing the health care provider to perform other duties. Theoropharyngeal airway (OPA) is an S-shaped device designed to hold the tongue off the posterior pha-ryngeal wall while providing an air channel andsuction conduit through the mouth (Figure 2.6). Itis most effective in patients who are spontaneouslybreathing but lack a gag or cough reflex. The useof an OPA in a patient with a gag or cough reflex iscontraindicated as it may stimulate vomiting orlaryngospasm. The OPA comes in various sizes toaccommodate children through large adults. Theproper OPA size is estimated by placing the OPA'sflange at the corner of the mouth; the distal tip ofthe device should reach the angle of the jaw. The nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) is an uncuffed trumpet-like tube made of soft rubber or plasticthat provides a conduit for airflow between thenares and pharynx (Figure 2.7). It is commonlyused in intoxicated or semiconscious patientswho do not tolerate an OPA. It is also effectivewhen trauma, trismus (\"clenched teeth\") oranother obstacle (e.g., wiring of the teeth) pre-clude the placement of an OPA. Proper NPAlength is determined by measuring the distancefrom the tip of the nose to the tragus of the ear.Though OPAs and NPAs help establish artificialairways, they do not provide definitive airwayprotection from aspiration. Supplemental oxygen Oxygen (O 2) should be administered to all ser- iously ill or injured patients with cardiac disease,respiratory distress, shock or trauma, even if their measured arterial O 2tension is normal. A variety of O 2delivery techniques may be employed depending on the desired O 2concentration and clinical circumstance (Table 2.1). Administrationshould begin at a high level and then be titrateddownward. Though O 2should nev er be withheld from a hypoxic patient with respiratory distress,care should be exercised when treating patients with chronic hypercarbia, such as patients withchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Unmonitored treatment of these patients with high O 2concentrations can result in respiratory depression from loss of their hypoxic ventilatorydrive. Ventilation Despite an open airway and supplemental O 2, a patient who is not adequately ventilating cannotconduct meaningful gas exchange. Adequate ven-tilation implies inhalation of enough air to deliverO 2to the alveoli and exhalation of enough air to facilitate the removal of carbon dioxide (CO 2). The sequence of interventions for the inad- equately-ventilating patient is opening the airwayfollowed by bag-valve- mask (BVM) ventilation. The self-inflating ventilation bag with face mask provides an emergent means of ventilation. It is equipped with several valves that allow for coor-dinated flow of air into and out of the patient.This includes a non-rebreathing valve that allowsexhaled CO 2to escape into the atmosphere with- out being entrained back into the lungs. WhenAirway management Figure 2.6 Oropharyngeal airway. Principles of emergency medicine 2.7Nasopharyngeal airway.attached high-flow O 2source can supply an O 2concentra- tion of nearly 100%. The adapter for the face mask is interchangeable with an endotrachealtube (ETT), so the same bag can be used post-intubation. The use of the BVM is a vital emergency skill. Competence with the BVM is a prerequisite forusing paralytic agents to intubate a patient.Substantial proficiency is required to use onehand to maintain an adequate mask seal, positionthe patient's head, and assure airway patency,while using the other hand to ventilate. Althoughmastery of solo BVM technique is imperative,recruitment of another individual allows one per- son to perform a jaw thrust and ensure a goodmask seal with both hands while the second indi-vidual squeezes the bag. The effectiveness of BVM ventilation can be determined by watching the chest rise and fall,feeling the resistance in the bag and monitoringthe patient's O 2saturation. Indications for definitive airway management Adefinitive airway implies \"patency and pro- tection.\" This requires an ETT in the trachea secured in place, with the cuff inflated, andattached to an O 2-rich ventilation device. The inability or failure to secure a definitive airway ina timely manner can have disastrous consequencesfor the patient.Though the ultimate decision to intubate a patient is often complicated and may depend on a variety of clinical factors, there are five fundamental reasons that patients require defini-tive airway management: 1.Failure of ventilation or oxygenation 2.Inability to maintain or protect the airway 3.Potential for deterioration based on the patient's clinical presentation 4.Delivery of treatment 5.Patient saftey and protection Failure to ventilate or oxygenate The patient who is inadequately ventilatingdespite maximal clinical therapy or remainsseverely hypoxemic despite supplemental O 2may need intubation. The decision to intubate thesepatients is based on a combination of clinicalfindings including general appearance, perfusionstatus, work of breathing, O 2saturation and clin- ical course. Intubation allows for the delivery ofhigher concentrations of O 2as well as positive- pressure ventilation which tends to improve mostcircumstances of hypoxia and ventilatory failure. Inability to maintain or protect the airway An open airway is required for adequate oxygen- ation and ventilation. Patients who are unable to swallow spontaneously and handle their secre-tions, or lack a gag reflex, are at risk for aspiration. Airway management 24 Principles of Emergency MedicineTable 2.1 Oxygen delivery techniques O2delivery Flow rate Concentration Other technique (L/minute) delivered (%) Nasal cannula 1-6 24-44 Inspired O 2concentration depends on flow rate and patient's tidal volume Simple face mask 6-10 35-60 May promote CO 2retention at lower flow rates Venturi mask 2-12 24-60 Accurately controls proportion of inspired O 2 Use in patients with chronic hypercarbia (i.e., COPD) Face mask with 12-15 60-90 Provides high inspired O 2concentration O2reservoir Bag-valve-mask 15 100 Provides the highest inspired O 2concentration Blow-by 6-10 Varies For infant or young child who will not tolerate face mask or cannula COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; O 2:oxygen.Though repositioning maneuvers (chin lift, jaw thrust) or airway adjuncts (OPA, NPA) may serveas temporizing measures, they do not providedefinitive airway protection from aspiration,which carries a significant associated morbidityand mortality. Therefore, patients who are unableto maintain or protect their own airway needintubation. The exception to this rule is the patientwith a rapidly reversible condition, such as a nar-cotic overdose or dysrhythmia. Potential for deterioration based on the patient's clinical presentation Anticipating airway compromise before it occursis one of the most challenging aspects of emer-gency airway management. Certain conditionsmandate the need for definitive airway manage-ment even in the absence of specific airway, ven-tilatory or oxygenation failure. This decision tointubate is based on anticipated anatomic orphysiologic airway deterioration or ventilatorycompromise. For example, the decision to intubatean awake, talking patient with a suspected ther-mal injury to the airway may be difficult but nec-essary to avoid future airway occlusion andcompromise. Delaying definitive airway manage-ment in this patient could allow for the interval development of significant airway edema, mak-ing endotracheal intubation extremely difficult ifnot impossible. Other patients in whom early air-way management should be considered includethose with significant facial fractures, penetrat-ing neck trauma, tracheal or laryngeal injuries,severe head injury, multiple trauma, sustainedseizure activity or certain overdoses (e.g., tricyclicantidepressant). Delivery of treatment The ETT may also provide a route for lifesavingmedications or therapy (e.g., rewarming) to a critical patient. In the patient with unobtainableordelayed intravenous (IV) access, an often overlooked method of medication administra-tion is ETT delivery. Narcan, Atropine, Versed(Midazolam), Epinephrine and Lidocaine can beadministered through and can beremembered by the mnemonic NAVEL . The absorption and extent of medication delivery via ETT is typically reduced; therefore, trachealdoses should be 2-4 times the IV dose. Addition-ally, a hypothermic patient can be gradually rewarmed via heated, humidified O 2continu- ously delivered via the ETT.Patient safety and protection Agitated, combative or confused patients mayharm themselves in certain clinical situations,making them candidates for prophylactic intub-ation. For an agitated multiple trauma patientwith an unstable cervical spine injury, sedationand intubation may be the only safe way to adequately immobilize and protect the patient during the initial assessment, diagnosis andtreatment. Definitive airway management Immediate \"crash\" intubation Patients with respiratory arrest, agonal respir- ations or deep unresponsiveness require immedi-ateintubation without the use of supplemental medications. The advantages of this approachare technical ease and immediacy. Disadvantagesinclude the potential for increased intracranialpressure (ICP) from the stress of intubation, aswell as possible emesis and aspiration. Rapid sequence intubation Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is a series ofdefined steps intended to allow for rapid oralintubation of a patient without BVM ventilation.Given that most patients requiring emergentintubation have not fasted and may have fullstomachs, BVM ventilation may inadvertentlylead to gastric distention and increase the risk of aspiration. To avoid this complication, thepatient is first pre-oxygenated with 100% supple-mental O 2to allow for a period of apnea without assisted ventilation. This is followed by thesequential administration of an induction agentand a rapidly-acting neuromuscular blockingagent (NMBA) to induce a state of unconscious-ness and paralysis, respectively. The patient maythen be intubated without the need for BVM ventilation. The steps making up RSI can be thought of as nine \"Ps\" (Table 2.2). Possibility of success The patient should be carefully evaluated for a potentially difficult airway, and assessed for easeof BVM ventilation should the intubation provedifficult or impossible. Principles of Emergency Medicine 25Airway managementAnticipating the difficult airway When evaluating a patient for ease of intubation and ventilation, it is important to use a consistentapproach. A logical easily-remembered approachto identifying the difficult airway is the LEMON law (Look externally, Evaluate the 3-3-2 rule,Mallampati, Obstruction, Neck mobility). Look externally Abrief and targeted exam of the jaw, mouth, neck and internal airway may help identify features that predict a difficult airway. Initialinspection should identify anatomic featuressuch as morbid obesity, abnormal facial shape,facial or neck trauma, large or abnormal teeth,protruding tongue or the presence of facial hair that may pose a challenge to intubation, ventila- tion or both. An abnormal facial shape, extreme cachexia, a \"toothless\" mouth with sunken cheeks,trauma to the lower face or facial hair may pre-vent an adequate seal for effective BVM ventila-tion. Large buckteeth or central incisors, areceding mandible anatomic oral intubation. Obesitygenerally makes intubation and ventilation morechallenging. Some of these features may also beremembered by the mnemonic BONES (Beard, Obese, No teeth, Elderly, Sleep apnea/snoring.) Evaluate the 3-3-2 rule The 3-3-2 rule describes the ideal dimensions ofthe airway that facilitate direct visualization of the larynx. It is easily remembered as three (ofthe patient's) fingers in the mouth, three fingersunder the chin and two fingers at the top of theneck. The ability to accommodate three fingers inthe mouth indicates an adequate mouth opening.Three fingers from the tip of the chin (mentum)to the floor of the mouth (hyoid bone) indicatethe patient's mandible is large enough to accom-modate a normally-sized tongue. A small man-dible and large tongue may obstruct access to thelarynx during intubation. Finally, two finger'sbreadth from the floor of the mouth (hyoid bone)to the thyroid cartilage indicates an adequateneck length and laryngeal position. A high oranteriorly-placed larynx may be very difficult tovisualize during laryngoscopy. Mallampati The Mallampati classification is a scale (I-IV)used to predict the ability of a patient's mouth toaccommodate both the laryngoscope and ETT. Todetermine a patient's classification, ask thepatient to extend their neck, open their mouth aswidely as possible and stick out their tonguewithout phonating. The degree to which the baseof the tongue, faucial pillars, uvula and posteriorpharynx are visible determines the Mallampaticlass (Figure 2.8). Class I and II predict greateroral access for the laryngoscope and superiorlaryngeal exposure, thereby portending a greaterlikelihood of successful intubation. In the case of Class III and IV scores, the tongue is large in relation to the oral cavity, signifying limitedoral access, a limited view and higher intubationfailure rates. Obstruction of the airway Upper airway obstruction can make intubationand ventilation difficult if not impossible. Whentime allows, patients should be screened for thepresence of upper airway infections (epiglottitis,peritonsillar abscess, preverterbral abscess), laryn-geal masses or tumors, or any other upper airwayconditions that may complicate laryngoscopyand BVM ventilation. Foreign bodies, extrinsicairway compression and direct airway trauma(including the possibility of airway disruption)should be considered strong evidence of anobstruction that could hinder or preclude intub-ation and ventilation. Neck mobility Proper mobility and alignment of the head andneck can facilitate laryngoscopy and intubation.Certain conditions such as cervi cal spine immo- bilization and degenerative arthritis may limitmobility and complicate intubation.

This point cannot be emphasized enough. The SOAP ME mnemonic is used to summarize the necessarypreparatory steps. SOAP ME Suction Suction should be tested and available at the bedside. Oxygen Ahigh flow O 2mask and BVM ventilation device should be ready for use. Airway equipment At least two functioning laryngoscope handlesand the appropriately-sized and shaped laryngo-scope blades should be available. The anticipatedblade of choice should be clicked into position toensure that the light functions properly. An ETTshould be chosen based on the patient's anatomy,and one smaller size should be prepared as well.The typical adult male will accept a 7.5- or 8.0-sizeETT, the typical adult female a 7.0- or 7.5-sizeETT. In children, the ETT size may be estimated bythe formula ETT size /H11005 4/H11001(age in years/4). The ETT cuff should be inflated to test for an air leak. Astylet should be inserted within the ETT to shape it into a configuration that will facilitate insertioninto the airway. This configuration varies betweenphysicians, although most prefer a gentle curve atthe distal portion to a near 45-degree angle. Caremust be taken to ensure that the tip of the styletdoes not protrude from the end of the ETT orthrough the small distal side port (Murphy's eye).Preparation of the ETT with the stylet inserted isrecommended, as it is easier to remove a stylet (if not needed) than to add one during RSI. Pharmacy The patient should have at least one IV line, and patency should be ensured. The specific RSImedications, proper dosing and sequence ofadministration should be determined, and the agents drawn up and labeled. Monitoring EquipmentCardiac blood pressure and pulse oximetry mon-itoring are mandatory for all patients. If avail-able, an end-tidal CO 2(ETCO 2) monitor should be prepared as well. Respiratory therapy should be at the bedside, as they play a crucial role in assisting with airwaymanagement, including securing the ETT andpost-intubation care. When dealing with a com-plicated airway, anesthesiology or ear, nose andthroat (ENT) specialists should be called in toassist with airway management. Pre-oxygenation During RSI, the process of direct laryngoscopy and ETT placement precludes the delivery of O 2to the paralyzed apneic patient, which could lead toarterial O 2desaturation ( /H1102190%). Pre-oxygenation establishes an O 2reservoir within the patient's lungs and body tissues that allows for a period ofprolonged apnea without detrimental arterial O 2 desaturation. This is accomplished through the Principles of Emergency Medicine 27Airway management Class II Class III Class IV Class I Figure 2.8 Mallampati classification.

Class I: faucial pillars, soft palate, visualized. pillars andsoft palate visualized, but the uvula is masked by the base of the tongue. Class III: only the base of the uvulacan be visualized. Class IV: none of the three structures can be visualized.Airway management 28 Principles of Emergency Medicineadministration of 100% O 2to the patient for 5 minutes prior to paralysis, effectively leading to \"nitrogen washout.\" This replaces room air (80%nitrogen, 20% O 2) in the lung with nearly 100% O 2. The time to desaturation following pre- oxygenation is determined by the duration of pre-oxygenation as well as the patient's age and bodyhabitus. Children and obese adults tend to desat-urate more rapidly than typical adults. Anon-rebreather O 2mask delivers O 2concen- trations in the range of 70-75%. A ventilation bagand mask placed over the patient's mouth andnose (without actively bagging) delivers 100% O 2 to the patient. In circumstances where time islimited, a patient can be quickly pre-oxygenatedby taking eight vital capacity (the largest possi-ble) breaths in rapid succession from a 100% O 2 source. Pretreatment During RSI, the use of succinylcholine (SCh), a depolarizing NMBA, and the act of intubationcanlead to a number of adverse effects including increased ICP increased intraocular intragastric pressure, and bradycardia (especiallyin children). Selected pretreatment medications may be given to mitigate these adverse effects; they maybe remembered using the mnemonic LOAD (Lido-caine, Opioid, Atropine, Defasciculation). Thesemedications, their indications, mechanisms ofaction and doses are summarized in Table 2.3. Paralysis (with induction) The next step in RSI is the rapid IV administration of an induction agent followed immediately byan NMBA to induce complete motor paralysis. Induction agents All patients with few exceptions (i.e., benzodi-azepine overdose) should receive an inductionagent prior to neuromuscular blockade. Induc-tion agents induce complete loss of consciousnessprior to NMBA-induced paralysis. Paralysis with-outsedation can lead to detrimental and undesirable psychologic sequelae. When com-bined with NMBAs, induction agents also enhancemuscle relaxation, thereby creating improvedintubating conditions. There is no single induction agent of choice for RSI in the ED. The choice of an induction agent isbased on the patient's clinical circumstance andthe agent's attributes. The most commonly usedinduction agents are discussed below and sum-marized in Table 2.4. Etomidate Etomidate is a non-barbiturate sedative-hypnoticagent. For most ED patients, it is the inductionagent of choice for RSI. It has a rapid onset, briefduration of action and causes minimal respira-tory and myocardial depression. Etomidate is theDrug Indication Mechanism Adult dose Pediatric Notes (IV) dose (IV) Lidocaine ICP , RAD (fentanyl) heart disease, response to in young children aortic dissection laryngoscopy Atropine Children SP /H1102110 years Mitigates bradycardic 2.0 mg 0.02 mg/kg Adults receiving a response to SCh (minimum dose second dose of SCh 0.1 mg) Defasciculation ICP or globe Defasiculates and 0.01 mg/kg 0.01 mg/kg for adults (pancuronium, injury mitigates ICP Medicine 29Airway management most hemodynamically stable of the currently available induction agents. Even so, the doseshould be reduced by 50% to 0.15 mg/kg in unsta-blepatients. Etomidate reduces cere bral blood flow and cerebral metabolic O 2demand without adversely affecting cerebral perfusion pr essure. Due to such cerebroprotective effects stability, is patientswith elevated ICP . Side effects of etomidateinclude vomiting, pain at the injection site,myoclonic movements and hiccups. Adverseeffects from cortisol suppression have not beenreported with one-time in the Ketamine Ketamine is dissociative anesthetic derived fromphencyclidine (PCP) Ketaminestimulates the endogenous causing a rise in heart rate, bloodpressure, myocardial consumption and bron-chodilation. For this reason, it is the inductionagent of choice for hypotensive, hypovolemic or bronchospastic patients r equiring intubation. Care should be taken in patients with ischemicheart disease. As ketamine increases ICP , cere-bral blood flow, and cerebral metabolic rate, it isgenerally avoided in patients with potentially increased ICP . Ketamine is known to enhancelaryngeal reflexes, precipitate laryngospasm. For this reason,atropine 0.02 mg/kg IV may be given in conjunc-tion with ketamine to pr omote a drying effect. Ketamine may produce an unpleasant emergencephenomenon, including hallucinations or fright-ening dreams in the first 3 hours after awaken-ing. Such reactions are more common in adultsthan children and can be reduced through theconcomitant administration of a benzodiazepinesuch as lorezepam no analgesia. The benefits of these agentsare their short onset of action and rapid depres-sion of central nervous system (CNS) activity.These agents also reduce ICP by reducing cere-bral blood flow, and provide cerebroprotectiveeffects through reductions in cerebral metabolicO 2consumption (while still maintaining cerebralInduction Induction Onset of Duration of Benefits Precautions agents dose (IV) action action Barbiturates Thiopental 3-6 30 Principles of Emergency Medicineperfusion pressure). Their major disadvantage is their propensity to induce significant hypoten-sion from myocardial depression and venodila-tion. For this reason, these agents are best avoidedin hypotensive patients. Other side effects ofthiopental include central respiratory depres-sion, histamine release (avoid use in asthmaticpatients), tissue injury and necrosis with extra-vasation. It is contraindicated in patients withporphyria. Methohexital is shorter-acting andmore potent than thiopental, and not surprisingly associated with more profound hypotension and respiratory depression. PropofolPropofol is an alkylphenol derivative with hyp-notic properties. It is rapid acting and has a shortduration of action. Although it blunts the potentialrise in ICP associated with intubation, it adverselyreduces cerebral perfusion pressure as well as systemic blood pressure. As a result, propofol isuncommonly used for induction in the ED. benzodiazepines causeamnesia, central muscle hypnosis. They also have anticon-vulsant effects. As induction agents, their pri-mary indications are to promote sedation andamnesia, their greatest asset. A drawback to theiruse is their great dosing variability, dependingon the patient's gender and age. Midazolam is amyocardial depressant and reduces systemicvascular resistance. It should be used with cau-tion in elderly patients and those with hemody-namic compromise. Though midazolam may beused as the primary induction or adjunctiveagent during RSI, it is more commonly utilizedfor sedation in combination with an analgesicagent in patients who are intubated. Neuromuscular blockade NMBAs do not provide analgesia, sedation oramnesia; paralyze the patient,facilitating rapid endotracheal intubation. Theideal NMBA would have a rapid onset, a shortduration of action and few adverse side-effects. SCh, a depolarizing NMBA, comes closest to meeting all of these traits and is the most com-monly used NMBA in the ED. At the neuromus-cular junction, SCh binds tightly to acetylcholinereceptors, causing depolarization of the motor endplate and muscle contraction. Clinically, thisinitially manifests as muscle fasciculations followed by paralysis. IV administration of SChresults in muscle fasciculations within 10-15 seconds followed by complete paralysis after45-60 seconds. Because of its short duration ofaction, patients may begin spontaneously breath-ing within 3-5 minutes. The dose of SCh is 1.5 mg/kg rapid IV push in adults. In children /H1102110 years of age, the recom- mended dose is 2 mg/kg rapid IV push. In new-borns, use 3 mg/kg rapid IV push. There is littleharm to giving too much SCh; however, givingtoo little SCh can result in an inadequately para-lyzed patient and affect one's ability to success-fully intubate. The main drawback to SCh are its side effects, including muscle fasciculations, bradycardia,hyperkalemia, prolonged , intragastric intra- ocular pressure, and can be inhibited through theuse of a defasciculating dose of a non-depolarizingNMBA. The bradycardia that follows the admin-istration of SCh most commonly occurs in childrenand can be avoided by pretreatment with atropine(0.02 mg/kg). Under usual circumstances, SChinduces a small but clinically insignifi cant rise in serum potassium of 0.5 mEq/L. However, inlarge burns, crush injuries, denervation or neuro-muscular disorders, the administration of SChmay lead to an exaggerated rise in potassium levels of 5-10 mEq/L and result in hyperkalemicdysrhythmias or cardiac arrest. Fortunately, thehyperkalemia risk is not immediate in thesepatients but occurs typically 2-7 days post-event,depending on the injury or underlying process. Non-depolarizing NMBAs such as rocuronium compete with acetylcholine for receptors at theneuromuscular junction, thereby causing paraly-sis. Although these agents are commonly used asdefasciculating agents or for post-intubationpatient management, they may also be used asthe primary RSI paralytic agent in specific patientpopulations or in patients who have a con-traindication to SCh. They have much fewer sideeffects than SCh but are generally less effectivefor intubation because of their delayed time toparalysis, prolonged duration of action, or both. Specific attributes of the depolarizing and non- depolarizing NMBAs are listed in the Table 2.5. Protection Following the administration of induction and paralytic agents, the patient will predictably loseconsciousness and become apneic. Sellick'sNeuromuscular Intubating Onset sec min Principles of Emergency Medicine 31Airway management maneuver (cricoid pressure) should be applied by an assistant just as the patient is noted to loseconsciousness. This application of firm pressure(10 lb) to the cricoid cartilage compresses theesophagus regurgitation ofgastric contents (Figure 2.9). Sellick's maneuvershould be maintained until the ETT has beenplaced, its position verified, and the cuff inflated. If Sellick's maneuver is applied too early, the patient may find it uncomfortable or vomit. Thismaneuver should be discontinued if the patient isactively vomiting because of the risk of esophagealrupture. Positioning Based on the patient's age, anatomy and otherconditions (cervical arthritis, cervical spine pre-cautions), the patient should be carefully pos-itioned in the manner that increases the odds ofsuccessful intubation.The airway can be thought of as having three separate axes: the oral, pharyngeal and laryn-geal. Proper positioning prior to laryngoscopyhelps align these axes and improve visualizationof the glottis. In the neutral position, these axesare misaligned (Figure 2.10). Placing a small pillow under the patient's occiput flexes the lower cervical spine relative tothe torso and aligns the pharyngeal and laryn-geal axes (Figure 2.11). Positioning the patient inthe \"sniffing\" position with extension of the headon the neck aligns all the three axes (Figure 2.12). Patients with possible cervical spine injury should be maintained in the neutral position. Placement After the administration of SCh, the patient will predictably have muscle fasciculations followedOA PA LA Figure 2.10 Head LA: laryngeal axis.

If patient has been adequately pre-oxygenated, arterial O 2satura- tions will remain normal despite apnea.Complete muscular paralysis can be confirmedby gently grasping the patient's mandible andchecking for flaccidity. It is important to waituntil the patient is completely paralyzed beforeproceeding with intubation. With the laryngoscope in the left hand, the mouth is opened with the right hand. The laryn-goscope is gently inserted into the right side ofthe patient's mouth, and the tongue is displacedto the left. The curved (Macintosh) blade is slidinto the vallecula; the straight (Miller) blade ispositioned below the epiglottis. The laryngoscopehandle is advanced along the axis of the blade atan angle of 45\u00b0 to the patient's body. Care shouldbe taken not to use the teeth as a fulcrum for thelaryngoscope. If the glottic aperture is not readily visible, the intubator or an assistant may perform the BURP(Backward, Upward, Rightward Pressure) maneu-ver.The hand is placed on the thyroid cartilage followed by the application of BURP to helpbring the glottis into the intubator's view (Figure2.13). The resulting displacement of the thyroidcartilage backwards against the cervical verte-brae, upward or as superiorly as possible, andlaterally to the right has been found to signifi-cantly improve the view of the glottis duringlaryngoscopy. With a clear view of the glottis, the right hand gently inserts the ETT until the cuff is about2-3 cm past the vocal cords. In the adult male, the23 cm marker of the ETT will be located at thecorner of the mouth (21 cm in women). Once inplace, the stylet should be removed and the cuffinflated until there is no audible air leak withBVM ventilation. Adequate pre-oxygenation will allow the laryngoscopist several attempts at intubationbefore arterial O 2desaturation occurs. A dedicated team member should be focused on the patient'scardiac rhythm, blood pressure and O 2satura- tion during laryngoscopy, and should alert the Airway management 32 Principles of Emergency MedicineOA PA LA Figure 2.11 Head elevated on pad, neutral position.

After any unsuc- cessful attempt, always recheck the patient's posi-tion and make needed adjustments. Consider changing the size or type of laryngoscope blade.It is important to change \"something\" prior to asecond look to ensure the same problem is notencountered. Proof: confirmation of endotracheal tube placement As inadvertent intubation of the esophagus can occur during airway management, proper place-ment of the ETT within the trachea needs to beconfirmed after every intubation. Sellick's maneu-vershould not be released until confirmation of correct ETT placement. Failure to recognize anesophageal intubation can be disastrous. Methods used to confirm correct ETT place- ment include clinical assessment, pulse oximetry,ETCO 2detection and aspiration techniques. Chest radiography can be used to assess ETTposition but does not confirm ETT placementwithin the trachea. Since the esophagus liesdirectly behind the trachea, an ETT placed in theesophagus may appear to be within the tracheaon an AP chest X-ray (CXR). Clinical assessment Classically, a combination of clinical observationshas been used to confirm correct ETT placement.These include: 1.The laryngoscopist observing the ETT pass through the vocal cords duringintubation 2.Auscultation of clear and equal breathsounds over both lung fields 3.Absence of breath sounds when auscultatingover the epigastrium 4.Observation of symmetrical chest rise duringventilation 5.Observation of condensation (\"fogging\") ofthe ETT during ventilation. Though these clinical findings should be assessedin every intubated patient, they are prone to erroras the sole means for confirming ETT placement. Pulse oximetry Continuous noninvasive pulse oximetry shouldbe standard for every patient being intubated. Adrop in the measured O 2saturation following intubation is worrisome for an esophageal intub-ation; however, this drop may be delayed forseveral minutes if the patient was adequatelypre-oxygenated, giving health care providers afalse sense of security. In certain patients (i.e.,hypotensive), O 2saturation measurements may be unreliable or difficult to detect. Althoughpulse oximetry is important, it should not be theprimary indicator of successful ETT placement. End-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2) detection Detection and measurement of exhaled CO 2is a highly reliable method for detecting proper place- ment of the ETT within the trachea. It is achieved through one of the three approaches: Colorometric ETCO 2detector is a small dispos- able device that connects between the bag andthe ETT. When the device detects ETCO 2, its col- orometric indicator changes from purple to yel-low; the absence of this color change indicatesthe tube is incorrectly placed in the esophagus. Afalse positive color change may occur if the tube is placed just above the glottis. A false nega-tive color change may occur (even with correctETT placement) in some cases of cardiac arrestand profound circulatory collapse, as CO 2pro- duction and delivery to the lungs abruptlydeclines. Qualitative ETCO 2detection devices use a light indicator with an audible alert, as opposedto a color change, to indicate the presence ofexhaled CO 2. Many of these devices have alarms that sound if the detection of ETCO 2ceases. Quantitative ETCO 2detectors perform capno- graphy, the graphic display of CO 2concentrations seen as a wave form on the monitor, or capno-metry, the measurement and display of CO 2con- centrations. Aspiration devices Aspiration devices may also be used for confir-mation of ETT placement. These work based onthe principle that the trachea is a rigid air-filledstructure, whereas the esophagus has collapsiblewalls. Attempts to draw air through an ETT placedin the esophagus will meet resistance from col-lapse of the esophageal wall around the distalETT. Air will freely flow when drawn through anETT in the trachea. The two commonly used aspiration appliances are the bulb aspiration and the syringe aspiration devices. The bulb aspiration device is a roundcompressible plastic globe (\"turkey baster\") whichis compressed and deflated before placement inthe ETT, and then released. If the bulb reexpandsrapidly, the ETT is likely in the trachea. Failure toreexpand or delayed reexpansion suggests that the ETT is in the esophagus. Syringe aspiration devices are large syringes (usually 30 ml) whichare inserted into the ETT. The syringe plunger isthen drawn back rapidly to allow the brisk aspi-ration of a large amount of air. The rapid easyflow of air suggests tracheal intubation, whereasmeeting resistance suggests an esophageal intu-bation. Though these aspiration techniques areeasy to perform, they are not as reliable as ETCO 2 detection. Post-intubation management After correct placement of the ETT in the trachea has been verified, a few \"housekeeping\" issuesmust be addressed. The tube should be secured inplace (taped or tied) to ensure it does not move.The patient's blood pressure and other vitalsshould be repeated frequently. Bradycardia fol-lowing intubation should be post-intubation suggests inad-equate sedation. the result ofa tension pneumothorax, decreased venous return,a cardiac cause, or the induction agent.Am e chanical ventilator should be configured according to the patient's size and needs. A CXRshould be taken to assess the ETT position (depthof placement) and the condition of the patient'slungs. Proper tube depth is generally 2-3 cmabove the carina. Insertion of the ETT into theright main stem bronchus is a common complica-tion (Figure 2.14). Following intubation, consideration should be given to long-term sedation and paralysisusing a benzodiazepine and NMBA. Diazepam(0.2 mg/kg) may be given initially for andrepeated for any signs of awareness. Lorazepam (0.05-0.1 mg/kg) perfectly acceptable alter-native. Pancuronium (0.1 or vecuronium(0.1 mg/kg) may be used for long-term paralysis;a repeat dose (one-third the initial dose) may begiven after 45-60 minutes if motor activity isdetected. An opioid agent such as morphine sul-fate (0.2 mg/kg) may also be administered foradditional patient comfort. Awake oral intubation Awake oral intubation is a technique utilizing liberal topical airway anesthesia and mild IV Airway management 34 Principles of Emergency Medicine Figure 2.14 Right main stem bronchus intubation. AP supine chest radiograph on a traumaboard showing an endotracheal tube in the right main stem bronchus,hyperinflation of the right lung and marked loss of volume in the left lung.Principles of Emergency Medicine 35Airway managementsedation prior to inspection or intubation of an \"awake\" patient's airway. The approach conve-niently allows for the preservation of the patient'sairway reflexes and spontaneous breathingwhile the laryngoscopist takes a gentle look atthe glottis, vocal cords and internal airwayanatomy. Whether to intubate the patient imme-diately or defer for a controlled RSI depends onthe potential for progressively increased airwaydifficulty or compromise. One might elect toimmediately intubate a patient with an airway burn or anaphylaxis with progressive swelling. The classic scenario for employing this tech- nique is the patient with distorted upper airwayanatomy, such as that resulting from blunt orpenetrating anterior neck trauma. Under thesecircumstances, intubation by RSI may be unsuc-cessful or impossible and subsequent BVM ven-tilation may allow air to enter the neck via theairway injury, complicating further management.Disadvantages of the awake oral intub ation tech- nique include oversedation, discomfort and stress,and potential for deleterious effects in patientswith cardiac disorders or increased ICP . Blind nasotracheal intubation commonly employed previously, blindnasotracheal intubation (BNTI) has lost groundto other more effective airway approaches. Whencompared with RSI, BNTI consumes more time,fails more often, involves the passage of asmaller ETT, and results in a higher number ofcomplications. There are certain clinical circumstances (spon- taneously breathing patient presenting with adifficult airway) where RSI is not advisable andBNTI may be the preferred route of intubation. Inthe patient with anatomic features that may posea challenge to RSI and BVM ventilation, awakeBNTI can be performed while preserving the patient's spontaneous r espirations. The procedure for BNTI begins with proper mucosal preparation to minimize epistaxis. Bothnares should be amountsof a anesthestic agent suchas cocaine or phenylephrine-lidocaine. Select a cuffed ETT size 0.5-1.0 mmsmaller than would be used for oral intubation.The tube should be lubricated with KY jelly oranother water-soluble lubricant to facilitate pas-sage. The balloon at the distal portion of the ETTshould be completely deflated. The bed may bereclined or left in the upright position, preferred by most patients and physicians. While standingto the side of the patient, the tube is inserted into the more patent of the two nares. The right side is preferable because the tube bevel will face theseptum, thus avoiding Kiesselbach's plexus. left naris consider inserting thetube \"upside down,\" then rotating it such that the curve follows the posterior nasopharynx once the turbinates are passed. Direct the tube straightback along the nasal floor toward the occiput,rotating it 15-30\u00b0 with advancement. Once the tube has neared the glottis, listen for airflowwithin the tube and watch the chest rise witheach breath. When maximal airflow is heard,quickly and gently advance the tube on inhala-tion. A cough will likely be heard with the pas-sage of the tube into the trachea. The tube shouldbe advanced to 32 cm at the naris in the adultmale and 27-28 cm in the adult female. As thetube is placed blindly, it may also be misdirectedinto the esophagus, piriform sinus or val lecula (rare). When this occurs, withdraw the tubeslightly, redirect and retry. If the tube becomescaught on the vocal cords, rotate the tube slightly to realign the bevel with the cords. Occasionally,external manipulation of the larynx posteriorlyor laterally with one's nondominant willfacilitate successful passage. BNTI is contraindicated in the apneic patient, since air movement is essential to tube place-ment. BNTI is also contraindicated in patientswith the possibility of cribriform plate injury,basilar skull or midface fracture out of concernthat the tube may enter the cranial vault. Patientswith bleeding disorders or coagulopathy maydevelop massive BNTI. com-plete listed inTable 2.6.

Long-term complications such as sinusitis or turbinate destruction are uncom-mon and result from multiple intubation attemptsor prolonged intubation. The difficult airway It has been estimated that between 1-3% ofpatients present with a \"difficulty airway,\" definedas difficulty securing the airway under directlaryngoscopic vision. Before administeringNMBAs, the emergency physician should alwaysassess the likelihood of a difficult intubation andthe probability for success. Every intubationshould be assumed difficult, especially in thepediatric population, and a back-up plan shouldbe formulated prior to proceeding. Success orfailure is often directly related to the airwaymanager's ability to anticipate problems, preparefor the worst-case scenario and address failure(Figure 2.15). The failed airway The failed airway may be clinically defined intwo manners: 1.The \" cannot intubate, can oxygenate \" scenario occurs when a skilled airway manager fails to intubate on three attempts but cansuccessfully BVM ventilate the patient. 2.The \" cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate \" scenario arises when the failure to intubate,regardless of the number of attempts, occurs in the face of O 2saturations that cannot be maintained above 90% or higher using a BVM.

Devices and techniques for the difficult or failed intubation This section briefly describes some of the devices and techniques that may be employed in theevent of a difficult or failed intubation. Lighted stylet intubation The use of a lighted stylet apparatus utilizestransillumination of the soft tissues of the neck tosignify correct ETT placement within the trachea.Due to the anterior location of the trachea rela-tive to the esophagus, a well-defined, circum-scribed glow can readily be seen in the anteriorneck when the ETT and light enter the glotticopening. If the tip of the tube is placed in the esophagus, the light glow is diffuse and notwell seen. Retrograde intubation Retrograde intubation involves by thread-ing a guidewire retrograde through the vocal cords and out the mouth or nose. The wire is thenused to guide the ETT through the glottis beforeit is removed.

This requiresa profoundly unresponsive patient. Laryngeal mask airway The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a modifiedETT with an inflatable, oval collar (\"laryngealmask\") at its base. The LMA is blindly inserted intothe pharynx wh ere it covers the glottic opening. Inflation of the collar provides a seal that allowstracheal ventilation. Though these devices are rel-atively easy to use, they do not provide a defini- tive airway since the supraglottic cuff does notprevent aspiration. An updated version of the original LMA, known as the intubating LMA, facilitates blindendotracheal intubation by allowing passage ofan ETT through the device and into the tracheawith a high degree of success. Combitube The Combitube is a dual-lumen, dual-cuffedesophageal/tracheal airway; one lumen func-tions as an esophageal airway while the otherperforms as a tracheal airway. Though theCombitube is blindly inserted and typicallyenters the esophagus, the presence of duallumens allows ventilation even if it the trachea. Fiberoptic intubation Fiberoptic techniques for endotracheal intub-ation have emerged as invaluable tools for themanagement of the difficult airway. These includethe devicesrequire considerable technical skill and repeated practice to maintain speed and success. Surgical airways Surgical airway management, unlike conven-tional airway management, entails the creationof an opening into the trachea to provide oxy-genation and ventilation. Proficiency with surgi-cal airway techniques can mean the differencebetween life and death.CricothyrotomyCricothyrotomy is the creation of a surgicalopening through the cricothyroid membrane toallow placement of an ETT or cuffed tracheostomytube (Figure 2.17). The proximal ends of these tubescan be hooked up to a BVM for oxygenation andventilation. A primary indication for cricothyro-tomy is the need for a definitive airway in thepatient in whom orotracheal or BNTI has failed,is contraindicated or is extremely difficult. Aclassic example is the patient with severe facialtrauma in whom conventional airway manage-ment is extremely complicated or unfeasible. The primary contraindication to cricothyro- tomy is young age. Due to anatomic consider-ations, the procedure is extremely difficult in children /H1102110-12 years of age and therefore generally avoided in this population. Other contraindi cations to cricothyrotomy include operator with the pr ocedure. Complications cricothyrotomy include surgical airway procedure is nee-dle cricothyrotomy with percutaneous TTJV(Figure 2.18). In this technique, a transtrachealcatheter is inserted through the cricothyroidmembrane into the trachea and connected to a jetventilation system which includes high-pressuretubing, an oxygen source at 50 psi, and an in-lineone-way valve for intermittent administration ofoxygen. 100% oxygen is then delivered at 12-20bursts per minute. The inspiratory phase shouldlast 1 second while the expiratory phase lasts 2-4seconds. Advantages of this technique include its simplicity, safety and speed. There is typically lessbleeding when compared with cricothyrotomy,and age is not a contraindication, making it thepreferred surgical airway in children /H1102112 years. During TTJV , the upper airway must be free of obstruction to allow for complete exhalation, or the patient is at risk of barotrauma from airstacking. All patients receiving TTJV shouldhave an oral and nasal airway placed. Unlikecricothyrotomy, TTJV does not provide com-plete airway protection. Therefore, it should be considered a temporizing measure until a defini-tive airway can be established.Principles of Emergency Medicine 39Airway management Special patients Pediatric Though the principles of airway management in adults and children are the same, a number of age-related differences must be accounted for when managing the pediatric airway. Specific anatomicdifferences between adults and children andtheir clinical significance in airway managementare summarized in Table 2.7 and Figure 2.19. Physiologically, pediatric patients have a higher rate of O 2consumption and smaller functional residual capacity; therefore, they tend to desaturatemore rapidly than adults. Compared with adults,children tend to have a shortened period of pro-tection from hypoxia following pre-oxygenation,and infants and small children may require BVMventilation during RSI to avoid hypoxia. Airway equipment selection is also based on the child's weight and length (Table 2.8). Achild's ETT size can be estimated by the size oftheir external naris, the diameter of their little fin-ger, or the formula ETT size /H11005 4/H11001(age in years/4). The depth of ETT placement may be remem-bered as approximately three times ETT size or(age in years/2) notch Figure 2.17 Surgical cricothyrotomy.

PVC: polyvinyl chloride.Principles of Emergency Medicine 41Airway management Drug dosing in children and the choice of med ications for RSI is based on a child's age and weight. Of note, the dose of SCh is higher in children (2 mg/kg) and infants (3 mg/kg) than in adults. Children younger than 5 years are notgiven a defasciculating dose of a nondepolarizingNMBA but are treated with atropine to preventbradycardia from airway manipulation. Atropineshould also be administered to all children /H1102110 years of age receiving SCh to prevent bradycardia.Fentanyl should be used with caution in infantsand small children, as it may lead to respiratorydepression or hypotension. Status asthmaticus Managing the sick asthma patient in the ED canpresent a tremendous challenge. Fatigue fromprolonged respiratory effort in the face of severesmall airway resistance commonly results in respiratory failure; approximately 1-3% of asthma exacerbations require intubation. In general,these patients are extremely difficult to pre-oxygenate due to a reduced functional residualcapacity, and may be very difficult to ventilatewith a BVM as a result of severe airway obstruction. The single most important intervention in the patient with status asthmaticus and respiratoryfailure is early control of the airway. RSI is themethod of choice (performed by the most experi-enced laryngoscopist) along with preparation forrescue cricothyrotomy. When compared with RSI, BNTI is more time-consuming, results ingreater O 2desaturation, and has a higher rate of complication or failure.Adult InfantJunction of chin and neck Epiglottis Vocal cords Cricoid ringCricoid membraneTongueTongue Figure 2.19 Anatomic airway differences between children and adults.

All patients should be pretreated with lidocaine1.5 mg/kg which suppresses coughing, improvesETT is catecholamines and produces bron- chodilation. Upon loss of consciousness, the patient should be laid supine and intubated. The largestpossible ETT should be used to allow for aggres-sive pulmonary toilet. The intubated asthmaticpatient should then be paralyzed and sedated tofacilitate oxygenation and ventilation. Thepatient's clinical condition may worsen afterintubation if the patient proves to be difficult toventilate, develops a tension pneumothorax ordevelops hypotension; caution is warranted. Increased intracranial pressure The presence or suspicion of increased ICP directlyaffects the approach to RSI, as the techniques andmedications used during RSI may further increasethe patient's ICP . There is a reflex sympatheticresponse to larygnoscopy that results in a systemic release of catecholamines and increased ICP . This response can be blunted through the administra- tion of fentanyl (3 mcg/kg), which is given over30-60 phase ofRSI. Laryngoscopy or any stimulation(i.e., suctioning) may also increase ICP by a directreflex mechanism unr elated to this catecholamine surge. The admin istration of lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) during the pretreatment phase effectively bluntsthis response and may \"defasciculating dose\" (aboutone-tenth the paralyzing dose) of a competitiveneuromuscular blocker given during the pretreat-ment phase mitigates this response. Pancuronium(0.01 mg/kg) or vecuronium (0.01 mg/kg)administered 3 minutes before the administra-tion of SCh effectively blunts the rise in ICP . The ideal induction agent reduce ICP , cerebral perfusion and provide somecerebral protective effect. Sodium thiopentaleffectively reduces ICP by decreasing cerebralblood flow, and confers a cerebroprotective effectby lowering O 2utilization within the brain. However, thiopental is a potent venodilator andnegative inotrope which can lead to hypotension,a factor associated with significantly increasedmortality in head-injured patients. Etomidate hasemerged as . ICP andconfers cerebroprotection in a manner similar tothiopental but provides remarkable hemodyna-mic stability. Suspected cervical spine injury All patients with significant blunt trauma areassumed to be at risk for cervical spine injury.Inadvertent movement of the neck of a patientwith an unstable cervical spine injury can lead topermanent neurologic disability or death.Accordingly, many trauma patients are trans-ported to the ED in a stiff cervical collar andimmobilized to a backboard. Though providingprotection of the cervical spine, immobilizationplaces the patient at risk for aspiration and venti-latory compromise. If the patient requires airway management, precious time should not be wasted obtaining asingle lateral radiograph of the cervical spine toexclude cervical spine injury. This approachdelays definitive airway management and pro-vides a false sense of security, as a single view isinadequate to exclude injury to the cervicalspine. Numerous studies have shown that the proper approach to managing these patients is RSI within-line immobilization (Figure 2.20). Paralyzing Figure 2.20 In-line immoblilization of the cervical spine.the patient reduces the risk of patient movement during intubation. A second individual main-taining immobilization of the head and neck inthe neutral position throughout the procedureprevents neck hyperextension during laryn-goscopy. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Learn to recognize objective signs ofimpending airway compromise. Though bedside maneuvers or airwayadjuncts can reestablish airway patency, they do not provide definitive airwayprotection. A definitive airway requires an ETT in the trachea secured in place with the cuffinflated and attached to an O 2-rich ventilation device. Competence with the bag-valve-mask isrequired for airway management. Lifesaving medications may be given via the ETT. Learn the 9 P's of Rapid Sequence Intubation Prior to initiating RSI, prepare for intubationusing the mnemonic SOAP ME . Adequate preoxygenation may allow thelarygnoscopist several attempts forsuccessful intubation to arterial O 2 desaturation. Select your pretreatment (LOAD)medications to mitigate the adverse effects of SCh and the act of intubation. NBMAs do not provide analgesia, sedation or amnesia, so always provide aninduction neuromuscularblockade. After any unsuccessful intubation attempt,change \"something\" prior to the nextattempt. Proper ETT placement needs to be confirmed after every intubation; do not rely on onlyone approach as the sole means forconfirming ETT placement. Following confirmation of ETT placement,secure the ETT, check vital signs, order achest X-ray and provide long-term sedationand paralysis (if appropriate). Not every patient needs RSI. Learn theindications and techniques for awake oralintubation and BNTI. Every intubation should be assumeddifficult, and a back-up plan should beformulated prior to proceeding.Be familiar with the algorithms, devices, andtechniques used for the failed airway.

Principles of Emergency Medicine 45Airway managementPrinciples of Emergency Medicine 47Cardiopulmonary and cerebral resuscitation Introduction One of the defining characteristics of emergency physicians is their ability to recognize and man-age the undifferentiated patient in cardiac or res-piratory arrest. Emergency practitioners must beexperts in understanding the pathophysiology ofcardiopulmonary arrest and the principles behindthe resuscitation of these patients. Modern cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) began in the late 1950s with the rediscovery ofclosed chest cardiac massage and mouth-to-mouthventilation. Advances in external defibrillationand other non-invasive techniques improvedsuccess rates of resuscitation and increased thenumber of individuals who could be adequatelytrained to immediately provide these interven-tions. The highest potential survival rate fromcardiac arrest can be achieved when there isrecognition of early warning signs, activation of the emergency medical system (EMS), rapid ini-tiation of basic CPR, rapid defibrillation andAdvanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS),including definitive airway management andintravenous (IV) medications. These steps areknown as the \"chain of survival.\" While many factors determine survival from cardiac arrest, initiation of early CPR has beenscientifically shown to save lives. Data fromSeattle demonstrated successful outcome in 27%of patients if ACLS is started within 8 minutes ofcardiac arrest. The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that for patients who have CPR started within 4 minutes of arrest and ACLSwithin 8 minutes, successful resuscitation isincreased to 43%. Pathophysiology Sudden cardiac death due to unexpected cardiacarrest claims the lives of an estimated 250,000adult Americans each year. Most of these eventswill occur outside of the hospital. The majority ofthese patients are men between the ages of 50 and 75 years, who have significant atheroscle-rotic heart disease. Underlying disease and co- morbid factors significantly affect the metabolicstate of cells before the onset of cardiac ischemiaand alter the ability of cells to recover from a prolonged ischemic event. Hypoxia or hypotensionprior to arrest, even if brief, creates tissue acido-sis in diseased cells, making them more resistantto resuscitative efforts. Cardiac arrest results in cessation of blood flow throughout the body. Anaerobic metabo-lism begins almost immediately. A cascade ofmetabolic events is created, including calciumrelease, generation of free radicals, and activa- tion of catabolic enzymes that further injure thebody's cells. The brain is most susceptible to theabsence of circulation and traditionally suffersirreversible damage after 5 minutes in an arreststate. Restoration of pre-arrest neurologic func-tion rarely occurs in patients with untreated car-diac arrest of longer than 10 minutes duration.The heart is the second most susceptible organ.Patients who suffer cardiac arrest from a non-cardiac cause remain at risk for secondary cardiacischemia in the post-resuscitation period. CPR, even utilizing maximal chest compres- sions, can only generate 30% of baseline cardiacoutput. The resuscitation period, therefore, stillcontributes to ongoing global ischemia. The goalof CPR is to preferentially direct blood flow tothe heart and brain in order to adequately restoreorganized myocardial electrical activity whileminimizing ischemic brain injury. There are twomain theories to explain how this happens. In thecardiac compression model , the heart is squeezed between the sternum and the thoracic spine cre-ating a pressure gradient between the ventriclesand the great vessels. This causes blood to flowinto the systemic and pulmonary arterial circula-tion. In the thoracic pump model , chest compres- sions cause a rise in the intrathoracic pressurethat creates a pressure gradient between theintrathoracic vascular bed and the extrathoracicarterial bed, which causes blood to flow downthe pressure gradient. The primary survey Emergency personnel need a systematic approachto resuscitation. The simplest and most familiarapproach follows the concept of the primary andsecondary surveys, and utilizes the ABCs (Airway,Breathing, Circulation) as a reminder (Figure 3.1).3Cardiopulmonary and cerebral resuscitation Robert R.

If these are present, assess thepatient's ability to protect the airway by askingthem to speak. If the patient can speak, immedi-ate definitive airway management is not likelyneeded. If the patient does not respond to ques-tions, the absence of a strong gag reflex confirmsthe inadequacy of protective airway mechanisms.Once you have established that the patient is notbreathing or unable to protect the airway, stepsmust be taken to provide airway support. If youare alone in the room, immediately call for assist-ance and then place the patient in a supine posi-tion. One must be careful in a patient who issuspected of having neck trauma to maintain in-line stabilization of the cervical spine. This isperformed by keeping one hand behind the headand neck while the other hand rolls the patienttoward you. Once the patient is correctly positioned on his/her back, open the airway. An unresponsiveor unconscious patient will have decreased muscle tone, allowing the tongue and epiglottisto fall back and obstruct the pharynx and larynx.In order to correctly position the head and openthe airway of the patient without suspected trau- matic injury, use the head tilt-chin lift maneuver (Figure 2.4). If standing on the patient's rightside, place the left hand on the patient's forehead and the fingers of the right hand under the bony part of the chin. Simultaneously apply firm back-ward pressure on the forehead tilting the headback and lifting the chin up and forward. Openthe patient's mouth to prepare for ventilation. Ifthere is visible foreign material in the airway, itshould be removed or suctioned away. If there is the possibility of neck trauma, the head tilt-chin lift maneuver could cause cervicalspine injury if the neck is hyper-extended. Insuch cases, the jaw thrust maneuver (Figure 2.5)should be utilized. To perform this maneuver,position yourself at the patient's head. Placeyour thumbs on the zygomatic arches on eitherside of the face. Grasp the angles of the victim'slower jaw with your remaining fingers, and liftthe lower jaw up and forward. Visible foreignmaterial in the airway should be removed or suc-tioned away. Breathing Most victims suffering from cardiopulmonaryarrest will not breathe spontaneously. After posi-tioning the head and opening the airway, oneshould quickly assess for chest excursion and thepresence of exhalation. If the patient is notbreathing or has inadequate respirations, assistthe patient with artificial respiration. In theemergency department (ED) setting, a bag-valve-mask device should be readily available. Utilizingthe same technique as the jaw thrust maneuverfor opening the airway, squeeze the mask betweenyour thumbs and your remaining fingers as youlift the jaw. This will create an airtight seal whileanother rescuer provides rescue breathing throughcompression of the bag. If you are alone, applythe mask to the patient's face. Place the middle,ring, and little fingers of one hand along the bonyportion of the mandible, and place the thumband index finger of the same hand on the mask.Squeeze the mask between your fingers on to thepatient's face to create an airtight seal. Compressthe bag with your other hand. Provide rescuebreaths of 2 seconds duration while watching forchest rise. If you do not see the chest rise or find it diffi- cult to compress air from the bag into thepatient's airway, reposition the head and maskand try again. If subsequent attempts to ventilatethe patient are unsuccessful, the patient mayhave an obstructed airway. Open the patient'smouth by grasping both the tongue and thelower jaw between the thumb and fingers, andthen lift the mandible. If you see obstructingmaterial, use a McGill forceps or clamp toremove it. If this equipment is not available, slide your index finger down the inside of the cheek tothe base of the tongue and dislodge any foreignbodies using a hooking action. Use caution toavoid pushing any obstructing material furtherdown the airway. If you still cannot effectively administer res- cue breathing and suspect an obstructed airway,perform abdominal thrusts. These abdominalthrusts elevate the diaphragm and increase airwayAirway: Open the airway Breathing: Provide positive-pressure ventilation Circulation: Give chest compressions Defibrillation: Identify and shock ventricular fibrillation (VF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT)pressure. The resulting air escape from the lungs can effectively dislodge an obstructing foreignbody from the upper airway. To perform thismaneuver, place the heel of one hand against thepatient's abdomen just above the navel and wellbelow the xiphoid process. Place your other handon top of the first. Press both hands into theabdomen five times in a quick upward-thrustingmotion maintaining a midline position. Then,reattempt ventilation. Circulation In the patient with suspected cardiopulmonaryarrest, one should check for a carotid pulse, asthis is the most central of the peripheral arteries. Acarotid pulse may persist even in the presence of poor perfusion. If no pulse is present, chestcompressions should be initiated and the patientshould be placed on a cardiac monitor. To ade-quately perform chest compressions, the heel ofone hand should be placed in the midline on thelower part of the sternum (just above the notchwhere the ribs meet the lower sternum). Theother hand is placed on top of the first hand andthe fingers interlocked and kept off of the chest.Position your shoulders directly over your handsand lock your elbows. Depress the sternum about1.5-2 inches approximately 100 times per minute,while allowing another member of the team togive rescue breathing after every five compres-sions. Properly performed compressions can produce a systolic blood pressure of 60 mmHg. Defibrillation Cardiac arrest from a primary cardiac etiologytypically presents as ventricular fibrillation (VF)or less often as pulseless ventricular tachycardia(VT). Both are treated identically. Early defibrilla-tion is the one intervention that has been shownto increase survival for patients in VF or pulselessVT. When defibrillation can be successfully per-formed within the first minute or two, as many as90% of patients return to their pre-arrest neuro-logic status. The longer the patient remains in car-diac arrest, the more likely that defibrillation andresuscitation will be unsuccessful. Survival rates are/H1102110% when defibrillation is delayed 10 min- utes or more after a patient's collapse. The term automatic external defibrillator (AED) refers to a sophisticated computerized device that incorporates a rhythm analysis system and a shockadvisory system. AEDs are designed to recognizeVF or VT and advise the user to deliver an electricshock to convert the non-perfusing rhythm to aperfusing one. Placing AEDs in public access areaslike airports, sports stadiums, or restaurantsallows quicker access to life-saving defibrillation.When police officers in Rochester, Minnesota wereequipped with an AED, survival from out-of-hospital VF averaged 50% with a median time from collapse to defibrillation of 5 minutes. Similarstatistics have been reported in public access trialsin other states. These survival rates are twice thosepreviously reported for the most effective emer-gency medical systems (EMS). Since survival from VF or pulseless VT is so time-sensitive, defibrillation in witnessed VF orpulseless VT should preclude any other type ofevaluation. Defibrillation should be attemptedwith up to three shocks as soon as the diagnosis ismade (Figure 3.2). Using gel or defibrillation pads,one paddle should be placed to the right of thesternum below the right clavicle and the other inthe midaxillary line at the level of the nipple. Firmpressure of approximately 25 lb should be appliedto each paddle. Alternatively, \"hands off\" defibril-lator pads can be used that are placed on the chestand the back, sandwiching the heart. Successful defibrillation depends on the amount of current transmitted across the heart.This is proportional to the energy output of thedefibrillator and inversely proportional to the Cardiopulmonary and cerebral resuscitation 50 Principles of Emergency Medicine 8 Mar 84 14:50:22 HR:180 SpO2--- Shock 3 360 J Figure 3.2 Rhythm strip of a patient with pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT).

Mahadevan, MD.transthoracic impedance, which depends on chest size, phase of respiration, and other variables.Current defibrillators are monophasic and The firstbiphasic waveform defibrillator was approved in1996. While not used in all EDs worldwide, thebiphasic waveform adjusts for differences intransthoracic impedance, allowing less energyrequirements for successful defibrillation. Animal studies showed their superiority over mono-phasic defibrillation for the termination of VF and pulseless VT. Early clinical experience with 150 Jbiphasic waveform defibrillation for treatment ofVF was suggeststhat non-progressive impedance-adjusted low-energy biphasic countershock (150 J three times) issafe, acceptable, and clinically effective. The secondary survey The secondary survey uses the same mnemonicas the primary survey; however, the inter-ventions are more involved and aggressive: Airway Endotracheal intubation is the most effectivemethod of ensuring adequate ventilation, oxy-genation, and airway protection against aspira-tion during cardiac arrest. In addition, it is anadditional route of entry for some resuscitationmedications, such as atropine, epinephrine, andlidocaine. Refer to Chapter 2 for a detailed dis-cussion of the preparation and performance ofdefinitive airway management. Breathing If the patient has been intubated in the pre-hospitalsetting, the adequacy of intubation should bechecked by auscultating the chest for equal bilat-eral breath sounds, identifying fog in the endotra-cheal tube on exhalation, and monitoring end-tidalCO 2(using The of exhaled CO 2on a monitor indicates propertracheal tube placement and can detect subsequenttube dislodgement. False readings can occur if CO 2 delivery is low in cardiac arrest patients due to lowblood flow to the lungs. False readings have alsobeen reported in patients who ingested carbo-nated liquids prior to intubation. A chest X-ray canhelp determine the location of the tip of the endo-tracheal tube in relation to the carina. The patientshould be placed on a ventilator for positive-pressure ventilation. Continuous high flow oxygen and pulse oximetry should be maintained. Circulation Intravenous (IV) access should be obtained,preferably with a central venous catheter in theinternal jugular, subclavian, or femoral vein. Twolarge bore peripheral lines may be acceptable andIV fluids should be infused. The patient's rhythmshould be identified and appropriate interven-tions instituted based on accepted ACLS guide-lines (see Figures 3.1, 3.3-3.5). Ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) VF and pulseless VT remain the most common underlying rhythms of cardiac arrest (Figure 3.3).The therapeutic goal is to convert these non- perfusing rhythms into perfusing ones. Early defib-rillation has been shown to be the most effective intervention, which is why recognition of VF/VTand defibrillation are addressed in the primarysurvey. If VF or pulseless VT is refractory to threeinitial attempts at defibrillation, vasopressortherapy in the form of epinephrine or vasopressinshould be administered. These agents have beenshown to improve the success rate of subse-quent defibrillation attempts as well as improve myocar dial and cerebral perfusion during CPR. Antiarrhythmic agents such as amiodarone, lido-caine and procainamide raise the fibrillationthreshold. Administration of these agents shouldalways be followed by repeated countershocks.The patient's cardiac rhythm should be moni-tored for changes between interventions, withresuscitation strategies modified based on any changes in rhythm or perfusion. Asystole and bradycardia Bradycardia leading to asystole uniformly has a poor prognosis. The goal of therapy is to increasethe heart rate to provide a perfusing blood pres-sure or, in the case of asystole, to re-establish a Principles of Emergency Medicine 51Cardiopulmonary and cerebral resuscitation Airway: Definitive airway management Breathing: Confirmation of adequate ventilation Circulation: Intravenous access, ACLS medications, fluids Defibrillation: Continued rhythm analysis and treatmentspontaneous rhythm (Figure 3.4). Primary brady- cardia occurs when the heart's intrinsic electricalsystem fails to generate an adequate heart rate.Secondary bradycardia occurs when factors otherthan the heart's own electrical system cause a slowrate, such as hypoxia, stroke, or cardiodepres-sant medications (beta blockers, calcium channelblockers, or opiates). Atropine and epinephrine are two medications that have demonstrated ben- efit in this setting. Atropine has a vagolytic effectby antagonizing the parasympathetic system.Epinephrine improves myocardial and cerebralblood flow during CPR. Though early transcuta-neous pacing should be considered for bradycar-dia, routine transcutaneous pacing for asystolehas not been shown to improve survival.

Manual, \u00a9 2001, Copyright American Heart Association.Principles of Emergency Medicine 55Cardiopulmonary and cerebral resuscitationPEA should be intubated to provide adequate oxygenation and given a rapid IV infusion of crys-talloid. If the patient has a treatable rhythm,appropriate rhythm-specific ACLS algorithmsshould be utilized. If the situation warrants, peri-cardiocentesis or needle thoracostomy should beperformed. If no reversible cause can be deter-mined, the patient should be given epinephrineevery 3-5 minutes. If the PEA rate is slow, atropinecan also be given. Unless a reversible cause is dis-covered, the prognosis of PEA is poor, with only1-4% of patients surviving to hospital discharge. Tachycardias Tachycardias may be common in patients prior to hemodynamic collapse. There are numerous reasons for patients to have tachycardia, not all of which cause hemodynamic compromise. Thekey issue in patients with tachycardia is whetheror not the patient tolerates their heart rate. Inother words, is the patient stable and able to sup-port a reasonable blood pressure that providesperfusion to the brain at that heart rate. Using theheart rate alone to determine hemodynamic sta-bility is inappropriate. Other issues to investigateinclude whether or not the tachycardia is causingthe patient's symptoms, whether it is regular or irregular, has narrow or wide complexes, and what might be the underlying cause (orcauses). The diagnosis and management of brady-arrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4. History Obtaining historical information about a patientin cardiac arrest can be difficult. Utilizing otherresources becomes paramount. Information must be gathered from pre-hospital providers, family,previous medical records, medication lists, orprimary care physicians. Clues on the patient'sbody (wallet, ID bracelet, traumatic injuries, nee-dle marks, scars, dialysis shunts) may be identi-fied. An attempt to learn the following informationshould be made: What were the events surrounding the arrest? Determine whether the patient had a witnessed arrest or was found unconscious. What was theapproximate duration of time prior to initiationof CPR (downtime)? Patients with shorter down-times have a better chance of recovery. Askwhether the patient was having any concerningsymptoms prior to the arrest like chest pain, pal-pitations, or shortness of breath. What has been the extent of the resuscitation thus far? Determine the patient's initial cardiac rhythm and any subsequent changes in rhythm through-out the resuscitation. Find out which interven-tions have been made including defibrillation,airway intervention, and medications, and thepatient's response to these interventions. What is the patient's past medical history? Concentrate on the patient's cardiac history and risk factors for coronary artery disease. Heart dis-ease is the most common cause of dysrhythmiasand sudden cardiac death. Knowing the patient'sprior medical problems or medications can pointto other possible causes of the cardiac arrest. This information is likely to be obtained while the patient is being resuscitated or stabilized.Another member of the health care team maysearch for it if the physician cannot leave the bed-side. Much of this information may be obtainedfrom family members. It is important to askquestions in a concise but sensitive manner.Communicate the critical nature of the situationwhile providing reassurance that care is being pro-vided and that the patient is not suffering. If appro-priate, it is also important to reassure the family thatthey did not cause or contribute to the situation. Physical examination Following the secondary survey, the physicalexamination should focus on vital systems andadditional clues that might point to the cause ofthe arrest. The physician should begin with thebaseline rhythm and vital signs (if they are pres-ent). A quick cardiopulmonary examination willdetermine cardiac activity, pulses, and the pres-ence or absence of breath sounds. If the patient isalready intubated, the adequacy of the airwayshould be rechecked. A quick head to toe survey,including the skin and neurologic examinationmay provide further clues. Subsequent examina-tions should focus on assessing the response tointerventions. After every intervention, vital signsand rhythm should be reassessed for any change.Afocused examination should be repeated after each procedure to assess for possible complica-tions (Table 3.1).Diagnostic studies Given that more than half of cardiopulmonary arrests in the adult US population are cardiac in origin, the most important diagnostic stud-ies include the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)and continuous cardiac monitoring. The physi-cian should look for ST-segment elevation consistent with an acute myocardial infarction,T-wave changes consistent with hyperkalemia, or ECG changes consistent with various toxinexposures.

Blood gas measurements can also assistthe practitioner with optimizing a patient's ven-tilator settings if the patient is intubated. In thepatient who is spontaneously breathing, bloodgases can help the physician determine whethermechanical ventilation would improve thepatient's oxygenation and ventilation. Serum electrolytes should be measured to identify the presence of life-threatening hyper-kalemia and renal failure. A glucose measurementshould be done initially during the resuscitation,as profound or protracted hypoglycemia can leadto cardiac arrest. If the historical data, clinical picture, and physical examination suggest the possibility of a toxicologic cause for the arrest, the patient'sserum and urine should be sent for analysis.Levels of prescription or over-the-counter drugsthat can contribute to arrest should be measured.Treatment may be required based on the suspi- cion of toxicity, as levels may not be back promptly. Achest X-ray is a mandatory diagnostic study that may help establish a definitive diagnosis in apatient with cardiopulmonary arrest, especially ifthe precipitating cause was pulmonary in origin.The chest radiograph can also confirm correctplacement of the endotracheal tube, central accesscatheters, and nasogastric (NG) tube. The use of bedside ultrasonography in patient's with cardiac arrest has become more widespread,in an attempt to identify any cardiac activity in the pulseless patient. It can differ entiate asystole from VF and confirm PEA. Pericardial effusionsresulting in tamponade can also be identified. Transesophageal ultrasound or echocardiography may be used to look for the presence of embolusin the pulmonary vasculature. Post-resuscitation care More often than not, patients who have been resus-citated following cardiac arrest are hemodynami- cally unstable, ventilator-dependent and comatose.Aggressive management post-resuscitation isessential to maximize their chances for recovery. The immediate goals for post-resuscitation care include the following list: 1.Provide cardiorespiratory support to optimize tissue perfusion, especially to the brain. 2.Transport the patient to an appropriate intensive or critical care unit (ICU or CCU). Ifone is not available, the patient should betransferred to a tertiary institution that canprovide critical care. 3.Continue efforts to identify the precipitatingcauses of the arrest. 4.Institute measures to prevent recurrence,including but not limited to maintenance ofantiarrhythmic drips when appropriate. All patients require a repeat thorough physi-cal examination. Particular attention should bepaid to the patient's cardiopulmonary status. Achest X-ray should be reviewed or obtained toconfirm endotracheal tube position. Ventilatorsettings should be adjusted to the necessary levelof mechanical support as determined by arterialblood gas values and the patient's spontaneousefforts. A 12-lead ECG should be repeated and compared to previous tracings. Continuouscardiac monitoring must be maintained. In thehemodynamically unstable patient, assess circu-lating fluid volume, urine output, and ventricu-lar function to determine the need for additionalcrystalloid replacement or vasopressor infusion.Invasive hemodynamic monitoring, such as arte-rial lines and Swan Ganz catheters, should beconsidered, although controversy exists regard-ing the necessity of such monitoring in the ED.Laboratory evaluations of electrolytes, cardiacmarkers, or drug levels should be reviewed,including the reassessment of the patient's acid-base status. All patients resuscitated from VF orVT should receive antiarrhythmic therapy dur-ing the first 24 hours post-resuscitation. Asignificant amount of brain damage can occur when blood flow to the brain is re-established afterresuscitation. This reperfusion injury involves many physiologic processes and is not completelyunderstood. It is important to maintain blood pres-sure, acid-base status, oxygenation, and adequatesedation during the post-resuscitation period inorder to improve long-term neurologic outcome. Termination of efforts Despite our best efforts, some patients cannot beresuscitated. The decision to terminate efforts at saving a life can be a difficult one. Many factorsneed to be considered, including time to the initia-tion of CPR, time to defibrillation, co-morbid dis-ease, age of the patient, initial rhythm, quality oflife prior to the arrest, and expected quality of life if resuscitated. The most important prognostic factor is the duration of cardiac arrest. The chanceof being discharged from the hospital alive andCardiopulmonary and cerebral resuscitation 58 Principles of Emergency Medicineneurologically intact diminishes as resuscitation time increases. Available scientific studies haveshown that pr olonged resuscitation efforts are unlikely to be successful if there is no return of spontaneous circulation at any time during 30minutes of cumulative ACLS. Reversible causes ofcardiac arrest such as drug overdose, electrolyteabnormalities, or profound hypothermia shouldbe taken into account when considering termina-tion of efforts. Treatment of these causes mayimprove the efficacy of the resuscitation effort andthe patient's chances of survival. Hypothermia (core body temperature of /H1102130\u00b0C/86\u00b0F) is associated with marked depres- sion of cerebral blood flow, oxygen requirement,cardiac output, and arterial pressure. Hypo-thermia may exert a protective effect on the brainand other organs in cardiac arrest. Although rare,full resuscitation with intact neurologic recoverymay be possible after prolonged hypothermic car-diac arrest. Research is ongoing to determine therole of induced hypothermia in cardiac arrest. When all Basic Life Support (BLS) or ACLS measures have been reasonably attempted andthe likelihood of survival is minimal, resuscita-tion efforts should be discontinued. Informingfamily members of the death of a loved one is avery difficult responsibility faced by emergencyphysicians. Prior to such a disclosure, familymembers should be gathered in a quiet and pri-vate area. Social service personnel and nursingstaff should be asked to assist. It is best to be honest and straightforward using language that is appropriate for the family's education level andculture. Briefly relate the circumstances regardingthe resuscitation efforts ending with the newsthat their loved one is dead. Avoid terminologysuch as \"passed away\" or \"is gone,\" which maylead to confusion. Family will often want to knowwhat, if anything, they could have done tochange the outcome. It is important to reassurethem that they did nothing wrong if this is appro-priate. Enlist the support of social services, clergy,or other culturally-appropriate personnel to assistyou with some of the associated issues, such asautopsy, organ donation, and viewing the body.Express your sympathy and make sure that thereis reasonable social support before leaving. Special patients The evaluation and treatment of cardio-pulmonary arrest is particularly challenging inthe pediatric population. Unlike adults, pediatriccardiac arrests are most commonly the result ofrespiratory causes. Reduced familiarity with pro- cedures as well as anatomic issues (i.e., decreasedsize of structures) make definitive airway man-agement and vascular access more challenging inpediatric patients. In addition, psychosocial issuesare generally more complex in these patients.Neonatal Advanced Life Support (NALS), Pediatric Temperature (warm and dry) Airway (position and suction) Breathing (stimulate to cry) Circulation (heart rate and color) Assess baby's response to birth Keep baby warm Position, clear airway, stimulate to breathe by drying, and give oxygen (as necessary) Establish effective ventilation \u007f Bag and mask \u007f Tracheal intubation Provide chest compressions Administer medicationsNeeded less frequently Rarely needed by newbornsAlways needed by newborns Assess and support Figure 3.6 Neonatal resuscitation inverted pyramid.

The cardiopulmonary arrestalgorithms are similar between children and adults,although the energy of defibrillation and medica-tion dosing Broselow tapewhich bases a neonate's or child's weight on the length is an essential piece of equipment for pedia-tric resuscitation. It has the appropriate medica-tion doses, equipment sizes, and defibrillation energies listed for the appropriate length (weight),and is color coded. Many EDs arrange the pedia- tric resuscitation equipment by these colors, inorder to make the appropriate equipment morereadily accessible during resuscitation.The algorithms for neonatal and pediatric resuscitations are included (Figures 3.6-3.9). Detailed discussions of these scenarios are beyondthe scope of this chapter. There no longer seems tobe controversy regarding parents or family mem-bers witnessing resuscitation attempts. This offersfamily members the chance to see the health careteam doing their best under difficult circum-stances, and affords family members the opportu-nity to more readily accept any outcomes. Again,support staff should be made available duringthese difficult situations. It is recommended thatdebriefing opportunities for the emergency healthcare team be arranged in a timely manner, for asmany providers as possible.

Pearls and summary points The highest potential survival rate fromcardiac arrest can be achieved whenfollowing the \"chain of survival.\" The brain and heart are the two organs mostsusceptible to damage from cardiac arrest. VF and pulseless VT remain the most commonunderlying rhythms of adult cardiac arrest. Many factors must be considered whendeciding whether to continue a resuscitation.Prolonged resuscitation efforts are unlikely tobe successful if there is no return ofspontaneous circulation at any time during30 minutes of cumulative ACLS. Aggressive post-resuscitation care can limitfurther cardiac and cerebral damage. In the pediatric population, arrest is dueprimarily to respiratory causes. All family members and loved ones ofpatients experiencing cardiac arrest shouldbe treated with extreme sensitivity, honesty,and respect. Whenever possible, trainedsupport personnel should assist familymembers and emergency providers with thechallenges of death notification, grieving,acceptance, and final arrangements.

Coron-ary heart disease is the leading single cause of death in the US, accounting for 21% of alldeaths. In the year 2000, approximately 681,000Americans died of coronary heart disease,amounting to one death every 60 seconds. Evenmore striking was the fact that nearly half ofthese deaths occured before the patient reached ahospital. Most of these were sudden deaths, usu-ally resulting from ventricular fibrillation. In fact,an estimated 491,000 deaths in 2000 had car diac dysrhythmias mentioned as a contributing factor. Despite the strong link between cardiac dysrhyth-mias and cardiovascular disease, rhythm disturb-ances may also occur in the absence of structuralheart disease or as a result of generalized systemicillness. Proper identification of cardiac dysrhythmias is a vital skill for emergency providers. A criticalaspect is the differentiation of benign frommalignant dysrhythmias. The appropriate identi-fication of the rhythm disturbance and a solidunderstanding of the underlying disease processare critical to the appropriate short- and long-term management of the patient. Dysrhythmiascan be broadly divided into three categories:tachydysrhythmias, bradydysrhythmias, and dis-orders of conduction. The recently updatedAdvanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS)guidelines place a great emphasis not only onidentification of the rhythm disturbance, but alsoon recognition of patients with left ventricular(LV) systolic dysfunction, as these patients areknown to have a significantly higher mortalityfrom each dysrhythmia. Anatomic essentials The sinoatrial node Normal cardiac conduction is initiated by thedominant pacemaker of the heart, the sinoatrial(SA) node (Figure 4.1).

Copyright \u00a9 2000, General Electric.the junction of the right atrium and superior vena cava, and its vascular supply is from the SAnodal artery, which originates from the rightcoronary artery in 55% of patients and the leftcircumflex artery in the remaining 45% ofpatients. The SA node is innervated by parasym-pathetic fibers from the vagus nerve and sympa-thetic fibers from the thoracic sympathetic trunk.Its normal discharge rate is between 60 and 100times per minute. The atrioventricular node In the normal heart, conduction proceeds through the atrial fibers to the atrioventricular (AV) node,which is located beneath the right atrial endo-cardium directly above the insertion of the septalleaflet of tricuspid valve. On the electrocar- diogram (ECG), atrial depolarization is repre-sented by the P wave (Figure 4.2). The AV nodalartery provides the blood supply for the AVnode, arising in the majority of cases (90%) fromthe right coronary artery. In patients with a left-dominant or co-dominant coronary circulation(10%), the AV nodal artery may arise from the leftcircumflex. Physiologically, the AV node slowsconduction velocity to allow greater time forventricular filling during diastole. In addition, itslong refractory period protects the ventricles fromexcessively rapid stimulation which could causeinadequate diastolic filling time and acute cardiacfailure. The AV node is innervated by the sameparasympathetic and sympathetic fibers as theSA node. On the ECG, the PR interval representsthe time between the onset of depolarization inthe atria and the onset of depolarization in theventricles, and is used as an estimation of AVnodal conduction time. The normal PR interval isbetween 0.12 and 0.20 seconds. Prolongation ofthe PR interval may occur as a result of excessivevagal stimulation, drugs affecting the AV node,AV nodal ischemia, or underlying conduction system disease. The His-Purkinje system Depolarization proceeds from the AV node to the bundle of His, which is composed of rapidly con-ducting Purkinje fibers. The bundle divides in themuscular interventricular septum into two majorbranches: the left and right bundle branches,which innervate the left and right ventricle (LVand RV), respectively. The left bundle branchdivides into the left anterior and left posterior fas-cicles. Ventricular conduction and depolarizationthrough the His-Purkinje system the surface ECG by the QRS complex. NormalQRS width is 0.06-0.10 seconds. Widening of theQRS complex beyond 0.12 seconds representsventricular conduction delay, which can occur asPrinciples of Emergency Medicine 65Cardiac dysrhythmiasa result of bundle branch blocks, aberrant con- duction, electrolyte abnormalities, drugs affect-ing represents ventricular depolarization andrepolarization time, is dependent to some extent on heart rate. A corrected QT interval (QT c) is obtained by dividing the measured QT interval bythe square root of the RR interval. A normal QT cis less than 0.47 seconds. Prolongation of the QTinterval can occur secondary to drug effects, elec-trolyte abnormalities, and congenital abnormal-ities; a Tachycardias and bradycardias The normal range of heart rates in a healthyadult with an intact sinus node is 60-100 beatsper minute. Bradycardia is defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute, while tachycardia is defined as a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute. History The history is the most important component inthe evaluation of a patient with a cardiac dys-rhythmia. Patients with cardiac dysrhythmias may complain of palpitations, or the sensation ofa rapid or irregular heart rhythm. They may notnotice the abnormal heart rhythm, and mayinstead complain of chest pain, shortness ofbreath, lightheadedness, fatigue, presyncope,syncope, or convulsions. Do you have chest pain or shortness of breath? Chest pain or shortness of breath may reflect underlying cardiac ischemia. Patients withunderlying coronary artery disease (CAD) canexperience symptoms of demand-relatedischemia during tachydysrhythmia Alternatively, ischemia can causeboth tachydysrhythmias and bradydysrhyth-mias. In fact, sudden death from unstable tachy-dysrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation(VF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) representthe leading cause of out-of-hospital death fromcardiac causes. A history of exertional or restangina may provide clues to an acute coronarysyndrome. Similarly, a history of orthopnea,paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lower extrem-ity edema may suggest underlying LV dysfunc-tion, which would increase the risk of suddendeath from ventricular tachydysrhythmias. Did you feel lightheaded, dizzy, or lose consciousness? Syncope is an important finding, as it portends a poorer prognosis in patients with either tachy-dysrhythmias or bradydysrhythmias, mandatingan aggressive workup to exclude an dysrhythmo-genic cause of syncope. Cerebral hypoperfusion from lack of cardiac output is the mechanism ofcardiogenic syncope; cerebral hypoperfusion canalso manifest as a seizure or an alteration in level of consciousness. When did your symptoms begin, and if they are episodic, how often do they occur andhow long do they last? If the patient complains of chest pain or palpita- tions, it is crucial to know how long these symp-toms last when they occur (seconds, minutes, orhours). How many times a day or week do theyoccur? During the workup of a cardiac dysrhyth-mia, it is important to correlate the presence of the dysrhythmia with concomitant clinicalsymptoms - chest pain, shortness of breath, orpresyncope/syncope. The frequency of symp-tom occurrence may dictate the type of monitor-ing device (Holter or event monitor) to use whenplanning an outpatient workup. Do you have a previous history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heartfailure (CHF), dysrhythmias, or valvular heart Given that CAD, CHF, and primary dysrhyth- mias are recurrent illnesses, it is important toidentify those patients with a prior history ofCAD or CHF, as these patients may be morelikely to manifest certain dysrhythmias. Valvular heart diseases such as have remitting course, and often recur. Certain dysrhythmias,especially atrial fibrillation and VT, can occur following cardiac surgery. These rhythm distur-bances have a different management and prog-nosis in this setting. Do you have a pacemaker or implanted defibrillator? Pacemakers are typically implanted for sympto- matic bradydysrhythmias such as sinus brady-cardia, sick sinus syndrome, or high-degree AVblock. A four- or five-letter code assigned to eachtype of pacemaker describes the chamber paced,the chamber sensed, the response to sensing, andthe rate adaptation programmability of the pace-maker. For example, a VVIR pacemaker is a single-chamber pacemaker that paces the ventricle (V),senses the ventricle (V), inhibits pacing (I) if anative beat is sensed, and has rate modulationprogrammability (R). A DDDR pacemaker is adual-chamber pacemaker that paces both theatrium and the ventricle (D), senses both theatrium and the ventricle (D), either inhibits pacingof or triggers pacing of both the atrium and theventricle (D) in response to sensing, and is ratemodulation programmable (R). Newer biventric-ular pacemakers have a third lead in the coronarysinus that allows for synchronized pacing of theLV and RV . Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are more common today given recent clinicaltrials demonstrating their effectiveness in pre-venting sudden death in certain patients. Theseinclude patients with CAD and LV dysfunctionor patients with prior episodes of VT or resusci-tated ventricular fibrillation arrest (termedsudden cardiac death). They are almost alwaysdual-chamber devices and also function aspacemakers. Both pacemakers and ICDs have a stored mem- ory that can be interrogated by the pacemakercompany representative or, in many cases, askilled cardiologist. This information can beextremely helpful in the analysis of a current orrecent dysrhythmia and can serve as a \"continu- ous telemetry box\" for the patient. The patient typ-ically carries a card with the pacemaker companyand the model, and a company representative isgenerally available 24 hours a day to interrogatethe pacemaker if necessary. Ask for a complete list of medications, including cardiac medications, non-prescription medications, herbal, andalternative medicines. Ask about illicitsubstance abuse. Medications and drug interactions are an impor- tant cause of con-tribute and tachydysrhythmias by increasingthe parasympathetic at the SA and AV by increasing automaticity in the ventricularmyocardium. Antihistamines, neuroleptics, andgastrointestinal (GI) medications such as meto-clopramide the QT interval andthereby predispose to ventricular tachydys-rhythmias. Herbal medications such as ephedra (Ma Huang) or jimsonweed tea can have sympa-thomimetic or anticholinergic effects, respec-tively. Excessive caffeine intake can have asympathomimetic effect, and can shorten therefractory period in the slow pathway of the AV node, predisposing one to AV nodal can contribute to the development of infec-tious endocarditis, which may manifest as heart block. Do you have any other medical problems, such as chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease, renal failure, or thyroid disease? Chronic pulmonary diseases can predispose patients to atrial tachydysrhythmias, especiallymultifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT). Inhaledbeta-agonists and anticholinergic agents used totreat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) and asthma can contribute to tachydys-rhythmias as well. Renal failure can contribute to hyperkalemia, which may cause heart blocks and bradydysrhythmias, and worsens digoxin toxic-ity. Hypocalcemia from chronic renal failure cancause prolongation of the QT interval.Hypothyroidism can present with significant Cardiac dysrhythmias 66 Principles of Emergency Medicinesinus bradycardia. Thyrotoxicosis can present with sinus tachycardia and is an important causeof atrial fibrillation. Is there a family history of dilated cardiomyopathy, sudden cardiac death, orearly coronary artery disease? Patients with a strong family history have a higher risk of similar diseases and carry a poorerprognosis. Dilated cardiomyopathy is known tobe an X-linked genetic disease. Certain heredi-tary conditions such as Brugada syndrome pre-dispose individuals to VT and sudden cardiacdeath. A history of a first-degree relative withCAD before the age of 50 years is an independentrisk factor for coronary events. Physical examination General appearance This is perhaps the most important part of thephysical examination in terms of guiding themanagement of a cardiac dysrhythmia. Does the patient appear ill? Is the patient clinically sta-ble or unstable? A patient is clinically unstable ifthey have evidence of end-organ hypoperfusionas a direct result of the dysrhythmia. This may bemanifested as severe chest pain, hypotensiondue to myocardial ischemia, or respiratory fail-ure with pulmonary edema. Patients whoare clinically unstable require immediate aggres-sive, focused management of their dysrhythmiaincluding medications, cardioversion, defibrilla-tion, or pacing according to ACLS guidelines.Patients who are clinically stable can be evalu-ated and treated in a more methodical fashion. Vital signs Is the patient hypertensive or hypotensive? Theabsolute blood pressure may be deceiving, andcomparing the current blood pressure with pre-vious normal blood pressures should be done.For example, a blood pressure of 100/50 mmHgin an elderly patient with hypertension and CADwhose normal blood pressure is 160/90 mmHgmay be more significant than a blood pressure of85/50 mmHg in a young, healthy female withoutprior history of cardiac disease. Assess the heartrate as well as the caliber and regularity of thepulses. Atrial fibrillation typically presents withan irregularly irregular pulse.Skin Inspect the skin for pallor, cyanosis, or duskinesswhich reflects tissue hypoperfusion. Palpate theskin to assess the temperature and moisture. Inthyrotoxicosis, the skin is typically warm andmoist; cool or clammy skin suggests hypoper-fusion. Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat Look for exophthalmos, which may be a physicalfinding of Graves' disease. Look for nasal flaringwhich may reflect acute respiratory distress andair hunger. Examination of the oral mucousmembranes provides clues towards the patient'shydration status. Look for perioral cyanosis,another sign of tissue hypoperfusion. Neck Inspect the level of the jugular venous pulsationsto assess the patient's volume status. Press belowthe costal margin to assess for hepatojugularreflux. When seen, cannon A waves in the jugular venous pulse suggest AV dissociation, which canoccur in third-degree heart block and VT. Thecannon A waves reflect atrial contraction againsta closed tricuspid valve. Inspect the thyroidgland for a goiter, thyroidectomy scar, or anynodularity. Cardiovascular Inspect the chest wall for the point of maximalimpulse (PMI). Palpate the PMI and note anydisplacement. The normal position of the PMI isthe 5th intercostal space in the midclavicularline. Inferior and lateral displacement of the PMI to the anterior axillary line or midaxillaryline can occur with progressive LV dilation andfailure. Palpate for an RV parasternal heavewhich can reflect RV failure. Next, auscultate the heart, listening for the regularity of rhythm,the loudness and splitting of murmurs. Atrial fibrillationis most commonly associated with an irregu-larly irregular rhythm. A left bundle branchblock can cause S2 to be paradoxically split (A2 will come after P2 and inspiration will causethe split to come together). A right bundle branchblock can cause wider splitting of S2. Listen foran S3 gallop which reflects LV failure. Finally,assess the quality of the pulses and evaluate capillary refill. Principles of Emergency Medicine 67Cardiac dysrhythmiasChest and lungs Look for a midline sternotomy scar that may reflect prior cardiac surgery. Inspect for acces- sory muscle use for breathing. Pulmonary ralesor wheezes may reflect volume overload and LVfailure. Percuss the chest wall for dullness andlisten for decreased breath sounds; these find-ings may suggest a pleural effusion and volumeoverload. Abdomen Inspect for any evidence of distentionor ascites. Palpate the liver edge; hypertension with signi-ficant tricuspid regurgitation. Extremities Inspect the extremities for their degree of warmth.The presence of cyanosis or clubbing may indicatechronic pulmonary disease. Pitting edema mayreflect volume overload. Neurologic Assess the level of consciousness. Is the patient'smental status different from baseline? Is there afocal neurologic deficit that warrants investiga-tion of a cerebrovascular accident related to thedysrhythmia? Diagnostic testing Electrocardiogram with rhythm strip A12-lead ECG is an essential part of the initial evaluation of a patient with a cardiac rhythm dis-turbance. All patients with a cardiac dysrhythmiashould be on continuous telemetry monitoringand have a 12-lead ECG performed on arrival tothe emergency department. Radiologic studies All patients should have a portable chest X-rayperformed to evaluate the cardiac silhouette,assess for pulmonary vascular congestion, andconfirm the appropriate placement of pacemakeror defibrillator leads, if present. Pacemaker leadfractures, although difficult to identify, may be acause for pacemaker malfunction or failure.Laboratory studies Cardiac enzymes Serum creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and troponin I should be all patients in whommyocardial ischemia is suspected. CK-MB beginsto rise 4 hours after myocardial injury, but is notalways specific for myocardial injury. Troponin Irises 6 hours after myocardial injury, and remainselevated for several days following the injury. It isnearly 100% specific for myocardial injury, andcan establish that myocardial necrosis hasoccurred so that appropriate disposition and treat-ment of the patient can be carried out. In addition,troponin I helps to risk stratify patients presentingwith a cardiac dysrhythmia, as those with elevatedtroponin Is are likely to have myocardial damage. Electrolytes Astat serum electrolyte panel should be obtained in every patient with a new cardiac dysrhythmia. In particular, serum potassium,calcium, and magnesium should be evaluated.If the patient is clinically unstable, some of thesetests can be ordered as part of an arterial bloodgas analysis, with the results available more rap-idly. Hyperkalemia predisposes the patient tobradydysrhythmias and heart block. It causesflattening of the P wave, peaking of the T-wave,and widening of the QRS complex. Conversely,hypokalemia may predispose individuals to ven-tricular tachydysrhythmias. Severe hypokalemiaresults in a more prominent P wave, a flattened T-wave, and a prominent U-wave seen following the T-wave on the surface ECG. Hypocalcemiamay prolong the QT interval, while hypercal-cemia can result in shortening of the QT interval.Serum magnesium levels are also important, aslevels influence potassium homeosta-sis. Hypomagnesemia can cause prolongation ofthe QT interval and predispose a patient to tor-sades de pointes. Thyroid function tests Aserum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should be obtained in patients with new onset atrial fibrillation or inappropriate sinus tachycar-dia. If the TSH is abnormal, a complete thyroidpanel should also be obtained. Similarly, patientswith unexplained sinus bradycardia should havea TSH drawn to rule out significant hypothy-roidism. Although these results are rarely Cardiac dysrhythmias 68 Principles of Emergency Medicineavailable during a patient's emergency depart- ment course, they are of use to the physician who admits the patient or sees the patient in follow-up. Drug levels Adigoxin level should be obtained in patients taking this medication. Digoxin toxicity should be suspected if the patient presents with sympto-matic bradycardia, high-grade AV block, atrialtachycardias with block, or bidirectional VT. Aurine toxicology screen should also be obtained,especially from those patients in whom illicitsympathomimetic substance abuse is suspected. Management of bradydysrhythmias General management After assessing and securing (if necessary) the airway, breathing, and circulation, obtainingintravenous (IV) access, and placing the patienton a cardiac monitor, a 12-lead ECG should beobtained. Stat bloodwork should be ordered asdiscussed. First, assess for the presence of serious signs or symptoms due to the bradydysrhythmia.These include hypotension, impaired tissue per-fusion, or any alteration in sensorium. If present,treatment should be initiated immediately. IV fluids should be started if there is no overt evidence of CHF. Atropine should be givenas it is effective in reversing supranodal causes ofbradycardia and may reverse functional AVnodal conduction block. Two milligrams ofatropine causes complete vagal blockade, so it isunlikely that doses higher than this will con-tribute to improvement. However, research isongoing about the appropriate maximum dose.ACLS guidelines recommend a maximum doseof 0.04 mg/kg for symptomatic bradycardia. If symptomatic bradycardia persists, the next medication to administer is IV dopamine atthe beta-receptor dosing range of 5-20 mcg/kg/minute. Dopamine is both positively chronotropic and ionotropic, and may assist with hypotension. It should be given through a centralline if possible to avoid dopamine-induced skinnecrosis. Other medications that may be usefulare 4.3).If serious signs and symptoms of bradycardia persist despite appropriate medical therapy,transcutaneous pacing should be initiated withpreparations for urgent temporary transvenouspacemaker placement. Management of specific bradydysrhythmias Sinus bradycardia Sinus rates of less than 60 beats per minute are termed sinus bradycardia. Sinus bradycardia iscommonly observed in individuals with a highresting vagal tone (athletes) or patients can also beseen early in the course of an acute inferior wallmyocardial infarction, triggered by parasympa-thetic stimulation, known as the Bezold-Jarischreflex. Sinus bradycardia should only be treated if there are associated symptoms. Elimination ofreversible aggravating factors is an essential first step in management. This includes discontinuingnegatively chronotropic medications and consid-ering administration of reversal agents (IVglucagon for beta-blockers, IV calcium gluconatefor calcium channel blockers, and Digibind fordigoxin). If the symptoms persist despite discon-tinuation of all bradycardia-aggravating medica-tions or if the medications are essential to thepatient's overall management, permanent pace-maker placement is indicated. Patients with aninappropriate sinus bradycardia should atrial rhythm or wandering atrial pacemaker This dysrhythmia is caused by an ectopic atrial focus distinct from the sinus node that representsthe dominant sinus rhythm. On the ECG, ectopicPwaves are recognized as being different from those in the patient's usual rhythm, and the PRinterval may vary from the patient's baseline PRinterval, depending on the location of the ectopicatrial focus. If three or more different atrial fociare seen, the rhythm is termed a wandering atrialpacemaker. These rhythms do not have clinicalsignificance, and no specific treatment isrequired unless warranted by symptoms. Principles of Emergency Medicine 69Cardiac dysrhythmiasSinoatrial block (sinus exit block) Sinoatrial (SA) block is characterized by the absence of atrial depolarization. This can occurdue to the SA node's failure to generate animpulse or failure of the SA nodal impulse to con-duct to the atria. On the ECG, Pwaves are typicallyabsent. The most common factors that predisposeto SA block are ischemia, hyperkalemia, excessivevagal tone or negative chronotropic drugs. Typically, an alternate region of myocardium becomes the dominant pacemaker and manifestsan escape rhythm.

Treatmentof SA block with escape rhythms is indicatedbased on the patient's symptoms. Sick sinus syndrome Sick sinus syndrome is a syndrome of abnormal- ities in cardiac impulse formation and AV con-duction that manifest as combinations oftachydysrhythmias and bradydysrhythmias. It isalso referred to as tachy-brady syndrome . Most patients present to the emergency departmentwith symptomatic bradydysrhythmias and a his-tory of episodic palpitations. The ECG manifes-tations include SA block, sinus or atrialbradycardia with bursts of an atrial tachydys-rhythmia (usually atrial fibrillation). Treatment of this syndrome is directed towards the specificmanifestation of the syndrome - either augmen-tation of rate with atropine if the patient hasbradycardia or rate control of an atrial tachydys-rhythmia with a beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker, or digoxin. One must exercise cautionwith these agents, as they may lead to excessivetachycardia or bradycardia. In the long term,most patients require a permanent pacemakerfor support during excessive sinus bradycardiaand an antidysrhythmic medication to suppresstachydysrhythmias. First-degree atrioventricular block AV block is divided into three grades, based on the ECG characteristics and the degree of the block. AV block is the result of impaired conduc-tion through the atria, AV node, or His-Purkinjesystem.First-degree AV block is defined as prolonged AV conduction without loss of conduction of any single atrial impulse. On the ECG, it is manifestedby a PR interval greater than 0.20 seconds. In first-degree AV block, the ventricular rate is not slow unless there is concomitant sinus bradycardia.No specific treatment is indicated. Negativelychronotropic medications should be used withcaution in these patients. Second-degree atrioventricular block In second-degree AV block, most but not all atrial impulses are conducted to the ventricles. It isdivided into two subtypes based on the ECGappearance and the underlying pathophysiology. Type I second-degree Type I second-degree AV block (referred to as the Wenckebach phenomenon or Mobitz Type I block) is caused by a conduction defect within the AV node itself (Figure 4.4). On the ECG thereis progressive lengthening of the PR interval onsuccessive cardiac cycles until eventually a Pwave is not conducted (\"dropped\"). This resultsin an irregular rhythm with \"grouped beating,\"usually in pairs or triplets, but occasionallylarger groups. Progressive lengthening of the PRintervals occurs because each successive atrialimpulse arrives earlier and earlier in the refrac-tory period of the AV node, and therefore takeslonger and longer to conduct to the ventricle.Another feature is a progressive shortening ofthe RR interval in the grouped beats precedingthe dropped beat. Type I second-degree AV blockcan occur following inferior wall myocardialinfarction, and occasionally requires temporarypacing in this setting. In the majority of cases,however, it is asymptomatic and requires notreatment. Principles of Emergency Medicine 71Cardiac dysrhythmias Figure 4.4 Second-degree AV block, Mobitz Type I. From Da Costa D, Brady WJ, Edhouse J.Bradycardias and atrioventricular conduction block. Printed with permission.Type II second-degree Type II second-degree AV block (or Mobitz Type II block) suggests a conduction block below the level of the AV node (Figure 4.5). This finding ismuch more ominous than Type I block, as there isa significant risk of progression to complete heartblock. It is caused by degenerative disease of theconduction system, termed Lev orLenegre disease . On the ECG there is preservation of a constant PRinterval on conducted beats with sudden loss of Pwave conduction. There is often a concomitantbundle branch block or baseline first-degree AVblock reflecting underlying conduction systemdisease. Patients with this form of AV block canpresent with symptomatic bradydysrhythmias orsyncope. As parasympathetic innervation isabsent below the level of the AV node, atropine isnot effective in treating bradycardia associatedwith this type of conduction block. Permanentpacemaker placement is indicated. 2:1 b lock Athird type of AV block exists that cannot be definitively classified as Type I or Type II. It is termed as 2 : 1 block and is characterized by two Pwaves for every QRS complex. The location of the block cannot be determined with certainty based on the ECG alone, as it may represent a 2 : 1Mobitz Type I block or high-grade conductionsystem disease. This type of conduction block canoccur or of H-V necessary to clarify the location of the blockand determine further treatment. Third-degree atrioventricular block Third-degree AV block occurs when there is absolutely no conduction of atrial impulses to theventricle (Figure 4.6). Atrial and ventricularimpulses may be present, but each occur inde-pendent of the other. This phenomenon is alsotermed AV dissociation . With third-degree AV block, a secondary pacemaker below the AV nodeassumes control and produces an escape rhythm.This escape pacemaker can originate from low inthe AV node or from the His-Purkinje system.This is usually evident from the width of the QRScomplex. On the ECG, there are visible P waveswith a constant PP interval that continuously Cardiac dysrhythmias 72 Principles of Emergency Medicine Figure 4.5 Second-degree AV block, Mobitz Type II.

In addition, there are visible QRS complexes with a constant RR intervalthat also marches through. As there is AV dissoci-ation, and the atria and ventricles beat independ-ent of each other, the PR interval is variable. Insome instances, it may be difficult to identify AVdissociation as the atrial and ventricular ratesmay be similar (termed isorhythmic AV dissocia-tion), and longer rhythm strips may be necessary. Management of third-degree AV block depends on the patient's clinical status. Drugs thatcan cause AV nodal block should be reversed. Ifthere is evidence of significant hemodynamiccompromise, transcutaneous or transvenouspacemaker placement is indicated. Unless aclearly reversible cause of third-degree block ispresent, most patients will require permanentpacemaker placement. With all forms of AV block,the patient should be questioned regarding riskfactors for Lyme disease, myocarditis, endocar-ditis, or lupus erythematosus, as these systemicillnesses can contribute to disease of the cardiacconduction system. Management of tachydysrhythmias General management As with bradydysrhythmias, assessment and sta- bilization of the airway, breathing, and circula-tion should occur rapidly. IV access should beobtained, the patient should be placed immedi-ately on a cardiac monitor, and a 12-lead ECGshould be performed and reviewed. Stat serumelectrolytes should be ordered as dictated. First, assess for the presence of serious signs or symptoms due to the tachydysrhythmia.These include hypotension, impaired tissue per-fusion, chest pain, hypoxemia, other signs ofworsening myocardial ischemia, or altered sen-sorium. If there are serious signs and symptoms,treatment should be initiated immediately, asdetermined by ACLS guidelines (Figure 4.7). Management of specific tachydysrhythmias Tachydysrhythmias can be best understood by grouping them broadly into two categories: narrow-complex tachydysrhythmias (defined as those with a QRS duration less than 120 millisec-onds), and wide-complex tachydysrhythmias than 120 milliseconds). Narrow-complex tachydysrhythmias are best understoodwhen grouped into those that are regular, with a relatively constant RR interval, and those that are irregular ,with a highly variable, RR interval. The regular narrow-complex tachydysrhythmias include sinus tachycardia, paroxysmal atrialtachycardia canpresent with either an irregular or regular ven-tricular response rate (or both). Sinus tachycardia In sinus tachycardia, a P wave precedes each QRS complex with a relatively uniform morphologyand constant PR interval. The heart rate usuallyranges from 100 to 160 beats per minute. Smallvariations in PR interval may be present, relatedto physiologic sinus dysrhythmia. As a general rule, sinus tachycardia is not a disease in itself; rather, it is a response to anextracardiac stimulus. As such, the rate itself doesnot require treatment; rather, the underlyingcause should be addressed. An important excep-tion to this rule is sinus tachycardia that occurs in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia. Inthis setting, reducing the heart rate with beta-blockade is indicated, in order to reduce myo-cardial oxygen demand and improve mortality.Systemic causes of sinus tachycardia includepain, hypovolemia, anemia, fever, hypoxemia,anxiety, sympathomimetic drugs, pregnancy, andpulmonary embolism. Sinus tachycardia can be mistaken for other causes of regular narrow-complex tachycardia,especially in children and young adults. Sinustachycardia that is near 150 beats per minuteshould be re-examined closely to ensure that it isnot atrial flutter with 2 : 1 block. Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (PAT) PAT is associated with a reentrant ectopic atrial focus distinct from the sinus node. It is character- ized by a heart rate from 100 to 160 beats perminute, having a different P wave morphologyfrom the patient's normal P wave. There may be1:1 conduction or variable degrees of AV block present.

It occurs in association with underlying electrolyte disturbances, drug toxicity, hypoxemia, andfever. Digoxin toxicity should be investigated inany patient presenting with PAT with 2 : 1 blockor complete AV block, as these are classic dys-rhythmias of that involves a micro-reentrant circuit within the AV node (Figure 4.8). There are typically twoanatomic pathways for transit of atrial impulsesthrough the AV node, a fast pathway (throughwhich sinus impulses normally travel) and a slowpathway (which is typically blocked due to a longinherent refractory period). AVNRT is triggeredwhen a premature atrial throughone of the pathways then travels retrograde upthe other pathway, causing depolarization of theatrium. The impulse returns to the AV node andthe cycle repeats. In the majority of cases, the impulse travels down the fast pathway and up the slow pathway(\"fast-slow\" AVNRT), while in the remainder ofcases, the impulse travels down the slow path-way and up the fast pathway (\"slow-fast\"AVNRT). On the ECG, a regular narrow-complex tachycardia is present. Due to the timing of atrialdepolarization, the P waves are usually buriedwithin the QRS complexes and are therefore notvisible. With the slow-fast AVNRT, inverted Pwaves may be present before the QRS complex. Treatment of AVNRT is predicated on tem- porarily interrupting the reentrant circuit, orconverting the unidirectional block to a bidirec-tional block. This can be accomplished throughvagal maneuvers or through drugs that prolongthe AV nodal refractory period, such as adeno-sine, beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.AVNRT may also be corrected through radiofre- quency catheter ablation of the slow pathway.

Printed with permission.Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) AVRT involves a macro-reentrant circuit includ- ing the AV node and a coexistent accessory path- way of conduction from the atria to the ventricles(Figure 4.9). In 90% of cases, the impulse starts inthe atria and travels antegrade down the AV node,then retrograde accessory pathway(referred to as orthodromic AVRT) before depolar- izing the atrium again. In the remaining 10% ofcases, the impulse travels antegrade down theaccessory pathway, then retrograde through theHis-Purkinje system and the AV node (referred toas antidromic AVRT) before depolarizing the atria. appears as a reg-ular narrow-complex tachycardia with invertedretrograde waves appearing after the QRS com- plex. Antidromic AVRT, however, appears as awide-complex tachycardia given the antegradeconduction down the accessory pathway. Retro-grade P waves are sometimes visible, so this dysrhythmia may be mistaken for VT. AVRT can also be treated with adenosine or calcium channelblockers which block conduction through the AVnode and break the macro-reentrant circuit.Extreme caution should be used if calcium chan-nel blo ckers are given to individuals with wide- complex tachycardias. Non-paroxysmal junctional tachycardia Junctional tachycardia occurs when there is increased automaticity of the AV node and acoexistent AV block. This results in a narrow- orwide-complex tachycardia, depending on wherein the AV node the impulse originates. It canoccur in the setting of digoxin toxicity, inferiormyocardial infarction, or acute rheumatic fever.Treatment is supportive. In a patient with chronic atrial fibrillation on digoxin therapy, the findingof a regular ventricular response rate despite underlying atrial fibrillation should raise the sus-picion of digoxin toxicity causing complete AVblock with a junctional escape pacemaker. Atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation is characterized by chaotic, disorganized depolarization of the atria with Cardiac dysrhythmias 76 are shownbelow. Dur ing sinus rhythm, the slurred initial portion of the QRS delta wave is due to early activation of part of the ventricles through rapid anterograde conduction overthe AP (accessory pathway). During orthodromic AVT delta wave is seen because all anterograde conduction is over the AV node (AVN)and through the normal His-Purkinje system. Retrograde P waves are visible shortly after each QRS. During antidromic AVT, there is maximal pre-excitation with wide, bizarre QRS complexes, because ventricular activation results entirely from anterogradeconduction over the AP . Diagram from Ganz LI, Friedman PL. Supraventricular tachycardia. New Engl J Med 1995;332(3):162-173. Printed with permission.multiple impulses from the atrial tissue (Figure 4.10). Mechanically, there is no effective contrac-tion of the atria, only a quivering of the atrialmuscle. The atrial impulses travel to the AVnode, where the majority are blocked and theremainder are conducted to the ventricles. This produces a heart rate from 100 to 180 beats perminute in patients with a healthy AV node. On theECG, the hallmark is the absence of definitive atrial activity with either coarse or fine atrial fib-rillatory waves. The ventricular response rate isalmost always irregular. Atrial fibrillation usually occurs in the setting of underlying heart disease, with systemichypertension being the most common coexistentcondition. Other associated conditions includevalvular heart disease (especially mitral stenosis)and ischemic heart disease. It can be triggered byextracardiac conditions as well, including thyro-toxicosis, underlying infection, or pulmonaryembolism. The immediate hemodynamic conse-quence of atrial fibrillation is the loss of the atrialcontribution (termed the atrial kick) to diastolicfilling of the LV . This should not significantlyaffect individuals with a normal heart, as dia-stolic filling in a normal ventricle results pre-dominantly from relaxation of the ventricularmyocardium. However, some patients with sys- tolic or diastolic CHF depend on the atrial kick for a large part of diastolic filling. In these patients,atrial fibrillation can result in hypotension orpulmonary edema, especially if there is a rapidventricular response that limits time for passivediastolic ventricular filling. In clinically stable patients, the treatment of atrial fibrillation is predicated on slowing theventricular response rate, which allows moretime for diastolic filling. This can be accom-plished with beta-blockers, channelblockers, or digoxin. However, with cases, theycan accentuate conduction through the accessorypathway by prolonging the AV nodal refractoryperiod. In clinically unstable patients manifest-ing hypotension, worsening cardiac ischemia,acute pulmonary edema, or alteration in senso-rium, the treatment of choice is immediate syn-chronized direct current (DC) cardioversion. Due to the disorganized atrial contraction asso- ciated with dysrhythmia, Accordingly, atrial fibril-lation carries an increased risk of thromboembolicstroke. The risk is greatest during the first 48 hoursfollowing DC cardioversion. Anticoagulationwith adjusted dose warfarin can reduce the riskof thromboembolism. Stable patients should beanticoagulated for at least 3 weeks before under-going elective DC cardioversion. If atrial fibrilla-tion has been present for less than 48 hours, DCcardioversion or chem ical cardio version (with agents such as amiodarone, pr ocainamide or ibu- tilide) can be performed without anticoagulation, provided that post-cardioversion anticoagulationis given. An alternative approach is to screenpatients for thrombus with transesophagealechocardiography (TEE). If the TEE shows noevidence of cardioversion can be per-formed without anticoagulation. atrial fibrillation should be referred for elec-tive echocardiography to evaluate their left atrialsize and LV systolic function, and should have aTSH to exclude underlying thyro-toxicosis. Atrial with 280-320 beatsper minute (Figure 4.11). It typically presentswith 2 : 1 block and can be mistaken for sinustachycardia. It can also present with 4 : 1 or vari-able AV block. On the ECG, flutter waves are bestseen in lead II as an inverted sawtooth pattern,but may be concealed within T waves or QRScomplexes. Principles of Emergency Medicine 77Cardiac dysrhythmias Figure 4.10 Atrial fibrillation. From Edhouse J, Morris F . ABC of clinical electrocardiography: broad complex tachycardia - Part II.Br Med J 2002;324(7340):776-779. Printed with permission.Atrial flutter is commonly associated with underlying heart disease, such as ischemic heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy. It is consid-ered to have the same pathologic spectrum asatrial fibrillation, and patients with atrial flutteroften have concomitant atrial fibrillation. Lesscommonly it is associated with myocarditis,blunt chest trauma, or pulmonary embolism. The treatment of atrial flutter in stable patients is rate control with a beta-blocker or cal-cium channel blocker. In unstable patients orpatients to convert atrial flutter to sinus rhythm.Ibutilide should be used with caution in patientswith structural heart disease or hypomagne-semia, as there is a higher risk of torsades depointes in these patients. Atrial flutter carrieswith it a risk of thromboembolism thanatrial anticoagulation should beconsidered in patients with coexistent atrial fib-rillation, patients greater than 70 years of age,patients with prior thromboembolism, orpatients with structurally abnormal hearts. Atrialflutter is curable through radiofrequencycatheter ablation, so these patients should bereferred to a cardiologist for further evaluation. Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) MAT occurs when there are numerous ectopic atrial foci that simultaneously depolarize, produc-ing at least three wave morphologies, anarrow QRS complex (unless a coexistent bundlebranch block is present), variable PR intervals,and a heart rate between 100 and 180 beats perminute (Figure 4.12). It is commonly associatedwith chronic lung disease and can be a manifesta-tion of theophylline toxicity. Fortunately, it is seldom life-threatening. Treatment should bedirected primarily at the underlying chronic lungdisease, although judicious use of calcium chan-nel blockers may provide symptomatic reliefthrough rate control. Electrical cardioversion isnot effective given the numerous sites of atrialectopy present. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) VT is defined as three or more consecutive QRS complexes originating from the ventricles andoccurring at a rapid rate. It may develop in a spo-radic, intermittent fashion that interrupts thepatient's underlying sinus rhythm (non-sustained VT), or as a consistent, uninterruptedwide-complex rhythm (sustained VT). It is typi-cally regular or only slightly irregular. VT isalmost always associated with underlying struc-tural heart disease, and is therefore more com-mon in older patients. It can have a singlereentrant focus as the nidus for the multiple reentrant foci poly- morphic VT), especially in the setting of ischemia (Figure 4.13). The most common underlyingcauses of VT are chronic ischemic heart diseaseand acute myocardial infarction. VT is importantto recognize and treat as it has the potential todegenerate into ventricular fibrillation. Allpatients with VT require an aggressive workupfor possible cardiac ischemia and admission to acoronary care unit. Perhaps the most challenging aspect of car- diac rhythm analysis is the differentiation of VTfrom supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) withaberrant conduction. While no set of criteria willabsolutely differentiate the two, several criteriahave been developed to assist clinicians. Thereare several characteristics on the 12-lead ECGthat strongly suggest the diagnosis of VT rather Cardiac dysrhythmias 78 Principles of Emergency Medicine Figure 4.11 Atrial flutter.

These include the following: 1.QRS-complex duration greater than 140 milliseconds : If the QRS complex is greater than 140 milliseconds, this strongly suggeststhat the rhythm is ventricular in origin. Animportant exception to this rule would be apatient with a baseline bundle branch blockin whom the baseline QRS duration fornormal sinus beats is 140 milliseconds orgreater. This is a rare scenario, however.2.Precordial QRS concordance : When the initial deflection in all of the ventricular complexesfrom V1 through V6 are either positive ornegative, this strongly suggests VT. This isvery specific for VT but not very sensitive.Negative precordial QRS concordancesuggests the origin of the tachycardia is theposterior wall of the LV and always connotesVT. Positive precordial QRS concordancesuggests an origin from the anterior wall ofthe LV and may connote VT. Principles of 12SLTMv229 Figure 4.12 Multifocal atrial tachycardia. Note three different P wave morphologies. From Pollack ML, Brady WJ, Chan 4.13 Monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. From Edhouse J, Morris F . Broad complex tachycardia - Part I.Br Med J 2002;324(7339):719-722. Printed with permission.3.Presence of AV dissociation : Given that VT is caused by an independent pacemaker within the ventricle, there is no relation of the atrialrhythm to the faster ventricular rhythm. Therefore, P waves and unrelated wide QRScomplexes can often be seen in the samerhythm strip. Clinically, intermittent cannon Awaves may be present in the patient's jugular venous pulse; these represent rightatrial contraction against a closed tricuspidvalve. This clinical finding is a hallmark ofAV dissociation. 4.Presence of capture beats and/or fusion beats : These beats represent interruptions of theunderlying ventricular rhythm by atrialimpulses that depolarize the ventricle, andstrongly suggest VT. A capture beat (Figure 4.14) occurs when a P wave arrives before aventricular impulse and results in a normal-appearing narrow-complex QRS in the midstof a P wave temporarily \"captures\" theventricle, but the underlying wide-complexrhythm eventually takes over. A fusion beat(Figure 4.15) occurs when a P wave arrives atthe same time as the ventricular impulse. Theresult is a QRS complex which is a hybrid between the normal narrow-complex and thewide-complex QRS of the ventricularrhythm. Neither the rate alone nor the clinical scenariodetermines whether the rhythm is VT. How-ever, a useful general principle is to treat anywide-complex QRS rhythm as VT until provenotherwise, especially if the patient is clinicallyunstable, has known structural heart disease, ora previous MI. Treatment of VT depends on the stability of the patient. Unstable patients require immediateDC cardioversion. Pulseless VT is treated as ven-tricular fibrillation, with immediate defibrillation.Stable patients can be treated with IV antidys- rhythmic medications such as amiodarone, pro- cainamide, or lidocaine (Figure 4.16). Serumelectrolytes should be drawn in all patients, andhypokalemia and hypomagnesemia should becorrected if present. Cardiac dysrhythmias 80 Principles of Emergency Medicine Figure 4.14 Capture beat.

Broad complex tachycardia - Part I. Br Med J2002;324(7339):719-722. Printed with permission.Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrant conduction Any of the previously discussed narrow-complex tachydysrhythmias can be accompanied by aber-rant conduction (Figure 4.17). This can be either aleft or right bundle branch block pattern. The fol-lowing criteria suggest a supraventricular rhythmwith aberrancy rather than VT: 1.Abundle branch morphology identical to that of the previous 12-lead ECG. 2.An ectopic P wave that precedes the QRS complex. 3.Variable coupling intervals between beats. 4.Response carotid sinusmassage. SVT with aberrancy will usuallyrespond with a slowing of the heart rate and possible termination of the dysrhythmia,while VT does not typically. When in doubt, it is safest and most appropriateto assume the rhythm disturbance is VT and treataccordingly. The treatment for all unstable patientsis synchronized electrical cardioversion. Torsades de pointes Torsades de pointes (\"twisting of the points\") is a special type of polymorphic VT that arises in patients with pre-existing prolongation of the QTinterval (Figure 4.18). It is a wide-complex tachy-cardia with an undulating amplitude that varies Principles of Medicine 81Cardiac dysrhythmias Stable ventricular tachycardia monomorphic or polymorphic?

Prolongation of theQT interval can occur as a result of the prodys-rhythmic effects of numerous drugs, prolongation of theQT interval as well. Treatment of torsades de pointes is aimed at interrupting the ventricular rhythm and restor-ing sinus rhythm. As the majority of patientswith this dysrhythmia are clinically unstable, DCcardioversion is the treatment of choice.Electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia,hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia should beaggressively corrected. In more stable patients,other treatment options include IV isoproterenoland overdrive pacing of the ventricle. Some clini-cians empirically administer IV magnesium sul-fate to treate this condition. Atrial fibrillation with pre-excitation This is a special case of atrial fibrillation where conduction occurs antegrade down a pre-existingbypass tract (Figure 4.19). As there is no inherentrefractory period in bypass tract tissue unlike in the AV node, ventricular response rates are usu-ally much higher. On the ECG, there is a wide- complex, irregular tachycardia with a rate rangingfrom 150 to 300 beats per minute. Delta waves(which may be seen on previous ECGs), a previ-ous history of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW)syndrome, or irregular R-R intervals which maybe as fast as 300 are major clues to this diagnosis. Conventional treatment of atrial fibrillation with AV nodal blocking agents is contraindicatedin the presence of a bypass tract. Instead, stablepatients should receive IV procainamide whichattempts to chemically cardiovert the patient tosinus rhythm without slowing conductionthrough the AV node. Unstable patients shouldundergo synchronized electrical cardioversion.Patients who manifest this rhythm should bereferred to a cardiologist for radiofrequency catheter ablation of the bypass tract to preventrecurrences.

It is characterized by regular, wide QRS complexes that are not preceded by P waves.It is commonly seen following acute myocardialinfarction, and is known as a \"reperfusion dys-rhythmia.\" AIVR is a stable rhythm that usually produces no symptoms and therefore requires notreatment. In some instances, the ventricular pace-maker may be the only functioning pacemaker inthe heart, and suppressing it with antidysrhyth-mics such as lidocaine can lead to asystole. Pearls, pitfall and myths Consider the etiology of the cardiacdysrhythmia, not just the rhythm itself. Certain medications and electrolyteabnormalities may predispose the patient toserious dysrhythmias. Learn to distinguish benign from malignantdysrhythmias. The patient's clinical (hemodynamic) stabilityis integral to the appropriate evaluation andmanagement of dysrhythmias.Treat the patient, not the rhythm. Err on the side of caution, especially withregard to medication choices or rhythm interpretation. Serial administration of medications isgenerally safer than a single large bolus. When in doubt about the etiology of a wide-complex tachycardia, treat asventricular tachycardia until provenotherwise. Before semi-elective cardioversion of atrialfibrillation, consider the risk ofthromboembolic stroke and the need foranticoagulation. Beware of atrial fibrillation in the setting of pre-excitation, as treatment with AV nodal blockade can lead to ventricularfibrillation. References 1.Braunwald E, Libby P , Zipes D.

Cardiac dysrhythmias 84 Principles of Emergency MedicinePrinciples of Emergency Medicine 85Shock Scope of the problem Shock is a state in which the oxygen (O 2) and metabolic demands of the body are not met by the cardiac output. When this process occurs in asingle organ, rather than throughout the body,organ ischemia and infarction ensue. When shockoccurs on a more global level, multiorgan dys-function and failure are the consequence, ultim-ately leading to death if not corrected. Shock ismost often accompanied by hypotension, termeddecompensated shock . However, shock may also occur with normal or elevated blood pressure.Examples include hypertensive emergency withcompromised cardiac output, or carbon monox-ide intoxication with the inability to deliver O 2 despite normal hemodynamics. The approach to the patient in shock must proceed with thesame urgency as the patient suffering from anacute myocardial infarction or cerebral vascularaccident. Classification Shock states are classified according to theunderlying physiologic derangement. Table 5.1lists the most commonly used classification sys-tem. Hypovolemic shock is defined by decreased circulating blood volume, either due to blood or fluid loss, such that cardiac output is com-promised. Impaired cardiac performance charac-terizes cardiogenic shock . Loss of vasomotor tone with hypotension is the hallmark of distributive shock , as in sepsis, anaphylaxis, or certain intoxi- cations. Anatomic interruption of sympatheticoutput, usually secondary to spinal cord injurywith disruption of the cervical sympatheticchain, leads to bradycardia and hypotension in neurogenic shock . Obstruction of blood flow through the cardiopulmonary circuit is the etiology of obstructive shock , as in tension diac tamponade, pul- monary a few patients presentwith a mixed syndrome , such as a patient with sep- sis who develops gastrointestinal (GI) hemor-rhage, or who suffers a concomitant myocardial infarction.General approach to the patient in shock If shock is defined by impaired global organ perfu- sion, then it follows that signs of shock are derivedfrom impaired organ function. Hypotension is anobvious sign of decompensated hemodynamicsassociated with shock. Alteration in mental status,chest pain, signs of cardiac failure, difficulty breath-ing, abdominal pain from intestinal ischemia, lowurinary output, and mottled skin all suggest shock. In a proportion of patients, the etiology of the shock state remains in question after initial evalu-ation. Often, therapeutic intervention must be ini-tiated without a firm diagnosis. The core principlein treatment of such patients is that O 2delivery to the vital organs must be optimized. History Obtaining an accurate history is essential toapproaching undifferentiated patients in shock.5Shock Robert J. Sigillito, MDand Peter M.C. DeBlieux, MD Table Classification of states Hypovolemic shock HemorrhageFluid loss/dehydration Cardiogenic pneumothorax Pericardial tamponade/constrictive pericarditis stenosis aClassified by some as cardiogenic shock. bClassified by some as distributive shock.Shock 86 Principles of Emergency MedicineDeficiencies in the historical database lead to poor treatment choices and increase patient morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, manypatients in shock states are not up to the task ofproviding an accurate and complete history.Medical records, family members, and friends are invaluable resources in these situations. Time course and progression of illness provide important information regarding the rapidity ofdecline and may help narrow the differential diag-nosis. Pre-existing conditions, particularly limita-tions of the cardiopulmonary system and immunedeficiencies, predispose patients to poor outcomes. Obtaining a patient's complete medication list is vital in addressing the needs of the patient inshock. Medications that impair normal cardiaccompensation in shock states, such as beta block-ers, calcium channel blockers, or digitalis, mayalter patient presentations in shock.Likewise, immunosuppressant agents, such asprednisone and chemotherapeutic drugs, mayimpair host immune response and mask seriousor life-threatening infections. Lastly, social his-torical data focusing on alcohol, illicit drug use,work history, and psychosocial support systemsmay offer insight into these complex patients. Physical examination Physical examination and rapid assessment of thepatient in shock follow the basic tenants of emer-gency medicine. Airway, breathing, circulation,disability, and exposure (ABCDE) are vital in theinitial evaluation of the most complex patientpresentations. If the impairment of shock is theinability to adequately provide O 2at the end organ, then the first critical appraisal must be airway, quickly followed by breathing and cir-culation. These first three steps comprise the crit-ical care concept of \"cardiopulmonary reserve.\"Cardiopulmonary reserve refers to the interde-pendence of the heart, lungs, and O 2-carrying capacity of any given patient. Those patients withan impaired cardiac pump, pre-existing pul-monary disease, or abnormalities in hemoglobinmay require a more immediate intervention forpossibly milder shock states when compared topatients with normal physiology. Normal lungs,heart, and hemoglobin permit a degree of physio-logic reserve that allows patients to compensatefor any given cardiopulmonary insult. One of the first steps in determining cardio- pulmonary reserve is vital sign assessment. In evaluating and treating patients in shock, thegoal is to maintain adequate oxygenation andorgan perfusion. Pulse oximetry is a rapid bedside tool that can be utilized as an initialscreening tool to determine the adequacy of oxy-genation. Goal saturations during resuscitationand treatment should be maintained above 90%,although outcome data does not exist for thisuniversally-accepted goal. The use of O 2delivery devices may be required to reach the goal of 90%;if adequate O 2saturations are not obtained with 100% non-rebreather mask, then patients shouldbe endotracheally intubated and placed onmechanical ventilation. Once oxygenation has been addressed, the focus should be placed firmly on maintaining adequatecerebral and coronary perfusion pressures to prevent injury to these vital organs. Vital organperfusion pressure is a function of mean arterialblood pressure (MABP). The critical nature ofdiastolic blood pressure (DBP) can be seen, as it isthe main component calculation: MABP /H11005DBP SBP /H11005systolic blood pressure. Goals for resuscitation and maintenance in the majority of shock states should attempt to get MABP in the 70-80 mmHg range to offer adequate cerebral and coronary perfusion. MABP can be better understood as it relates to preload and afterload. Physiologically, preload is defined as the left ventricular end diastolic walltension. Clinically, several measures can be usedto estimate whether the preload is low, normal, or high. The clinical situation may strongly sug-gest a patient's volume status. Actively bleedingpatients, trauma victims, or chronically dehy-drated patients are virtually certain to have a lowpreload. The edematous patient with congestiveheart failure (CHF) is likely to be volume over-loaded. Estimation of the jugular venous pressure(JVP) on physical examination can be rapidly per- formed; however, the accuracy of this technique isnot high, even in the hands of an experienced clin-ician. Auscultation of the heart and lungs is sen-sitive for detecting signs of volume overload (S3,crackles, and rales), but does not distinguish thehypovolemic state. Assessment of skin turgor,capillary refill, and the mucous membranes canlikewise be misleading. Afterload is the force that the heart must generate in order to eject blood into the arterialcompartment. Since MABP is proportional to the product of systemic vascular resistance (SVR)and the cardiac output (CO), SVR is one of the1-3main determinants of afterload. A comprehensive review of the technique for insertion, calibration, and collection of data from a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter is beyond the scope of this chapter. It is essential to note that excessive heart rate (HR) increases myocardial O 2consumption and may further compromise at-risk myocardium.Additionally, patients with normal vital signscan be in profound shock states despite calcu-lated MABP , central venous pressure (CVP), HR,and O 2saturation that are considered within normal ranges. After the assessment of the cardiopulmonary reserve, a rapid neurological assessment is per- formed followed by complete exposure of thepatient. Next, a comprehensive head-to-toe phys-ical examination is performed to identify evi-dence of decreased organ perfusion and to searchfor the etiology of the presenting complaint.Altered mental status, cyanosis, delayed capillaryrefill, and skin mottling may be early signs of decreased oxygenation and perfusion. Differential diagnosis Physical examination and right heart catheteriza-tion are useful in the determination of the etiologyof the various shock states, but the latter is rarelyimmediately available in the emergency depart-ment (ED). Table 5.2 outlines the physiologicparameters that characterize each shock state. Hypovolemic shock Hypovolemic shock is defined by the loss ofintravascular volume. CVP , pulmonary arteryocclusion pressure (PAOP), and cardiac outputare low, while SVR is elevated. In the early com-pensated stages, the pulse pressure is narroweddue to vasoconstriction, but ultimately hypoten-sion occurs with decompensation. The of hypovolemic shock is aggressivevolume expansion with crystalloid solution.Transfusion of blood products may be required if hemorrhage is the cause of hypovolemia. Cardiogenic shock The most common cause of cardiogenic shock isacute myocardial infarction, accounting for nearlyhalf the cases. Low cardiac output and high SVRcharacterize cardiogenic shock. CVP and PAOPare most often elevated during acute exacerba tions of CHF, but may be normal if the patient hasreceived adequate diuresis. Suggested cardiac parameters for the diagnosis of cardiogenicshock include cardiac index (CI) includes preload andafterload reduction. When shock is present, add-ition of a cardiotonic vasopressor is required.Strong evidence supporting selection of one vaso-pressor over another does not exist. Consensuscommittee (ACC/AHA) has recommended theuse of dobutamine if SBP is greater than 90,dopamine if SBP is less than 90, and norepin-ephrine if hypotension is severe or refractory todopamine infusion. An intra-aortic balloon pump(IABP) should be considered for patients who donot respond to vasopressor therapy. This tech-nique employs plasty and/or coronary artery bypass grafting should bestrongly considered in patients with acute coro-nary ischemia complicated by shock. Principles of Emergency Medicine 87ShockTable 5.2 Physiologic parameters in are diminished due to impaired venous return. Measured pressure is falsely elevated, reflecting pleural pressure rather than vascular pressure. bTrue left atrial pressure is low due to obstruction of flow through the pulmonary vasculature. Measuredpressure may be falsely elevated, reflecting pulmonaryvascular resistance rather than left heart filling pressure.Distributive shock In early sepsis, SVR is elevated. However, as septic shock progresses, SVR drops precipitously.Cardiac output is increased in most cases, but acytokine known as myocardial depressant factor isbelieved to be released from the pancreas, and mayimpair systolic function in later stages. Impairedcardiac perfusion will also adversely affect cardiacoutput. Vascular permeability is increased. Fluidshifts and increased insensible losses may lead tointravascular volume depletion and low CVP andPAOP . Early broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and emergent surgical drainage or debride-ment, when indicated, are the cornerstones oftreatment. Volume replacement should be guidedby invasive monitoring of either CVP or PAOP .Norepinephrine is the vasoactive agent of to the US, activated protein Ccomplex (Xigris \u00ae) may improve survival. Anaphylactic shock is accompanied by the massive release of cytokines in an inflammatorycascade, with loss of vasomotor tone and increasedvascular permeability. Epinephrine, steroids, andantihistamines are Persistenthypotension of an agent thatsupports vasomotor tone. Again, norepinephrinemakes the most sense physiologically. Neurogenic shock Neurogenic shock, classified by some as a type ofdistributive shock, is a consequence of injury tothe sympathetic ganglion chain. Neurogenic shockcharacteristically manifests as hypotension andbradycardia. Since spinal cord injury is most preva-lent in the young population, this entity usually occurs in patients with normal cardiac function.It is of the utmost importance to rule out occulthemorrhage, and to use signs of organ perfusionto guide the initiation of pharmacologic therapy.Many of these patients perfuse their organs wellat below-normal MABP . If signs of an agent that sup-ports SVR (norepinephrine or neosynephrine)makes the most sense physiologically. Obstructive shock Two causes of obstructive shock, tension pneumo- thorax and cardiac tamponade, are reversible bysurgical intervention. Support of the patient byvolume loading is temporizing at best. Massivepulmonary embolus causes the release of vaso-active cytokines from the pulmonary vascular bed,obstruction of flow, and acute right ventriculardysfunction, collectively impairing left ventricu-lar filling. Thrombectomy or thrombolysis can belife-saving interventions. Support of cardiac func-tion with volume infusions and dobutamine maybe a bridge to these interventions. Chronic pul-monary hypertension may also limit flow throughthe pulmonary vascular bed. The onset of shock isan end-stage, pre-terminal event. Treatment withpotent pulmonary vasodilators shock state since hypotension from peripheralarterial dilation is a frequent side effect, mandat-ing use of a pulmonary artery catheter. Diagnostic testing Rapid bedside screening is the hallmark of theinitial approach to screening and assessment ofthe undifferentiated patient in shock. Vital signs,pulse oximetry, and continuous monitoring arethe standard testing. Following a head-to-toeassessment, a Foley catheter should be placedwith an urometer to assess adequate hourly uri-nary output (0.5ml/kg/hour). Initial screeningstudies for the undifferentiated patient include:bedside blood sugar analysis, arterial blood gasanalysis, chest radiography, and an electrocar-diogram. A comprehensive metabolic profile, uri-nalysis, and complete blood count are required oneach patient. Consideration for toxicologic stud-ies, blood and urine cultures, cardiac profiles,and endocrinologic screening should be made ona case-by-case basis. Serum lactate levels can beused to guide therapy, and may have prognosticvalue. An argument can be made to perform aquick, bedside echocardiogram to exclude casesof cardiac tamponade and global cardiac hypoki-nesis, but controlled trials supporting thisapproach have not been published. Additionalradiographic studies of the head, chest, abdomen,pelvis, and extremities are second-tier studiesand should only be obtained once the patient hasbeen clinically stabilized. General treatment principles Oxygenation Whenever a shock state is present, O 2supplemen- tation is required. O 2may be delivered via facial delivery devices, non-invasive mechanical venti- lation, or by conventional mechanical ventilation. Shock 88 Principles of Emergency MedicineSimple means of delivering supplemental O 2 include the use of a nasal cannula, venturi mask, or O 2-reservoir non-rebreathing apparatus. O 2 delivered via nasal cannula is appropriate onlywhen low O 2flow is required. It is impossible to determine the fraction of inspired O 2(FiO 2) delivered to any given patient because it varieswith respiratory rate, the degree of nasal versusmouth breathing, and the O 2flow rate. In general, if more than 5 L/min of O 2flow is required with a nasal cannula, then an alternative device shouldbe employed. Aventuri mask uses various O 2flow rates combined with various venturi apertures to pro-duce increasing O 2supplementation, generally higher than can be delivered by nasal cannula.Although each mask lists specific FiO 2ratings from 0.28 to 0.50, these are rough estimates atbest. If the listed flow rate with the smallest aper-ture does not provide enough supplemental O 2, then an alternative device is required. Anon-rebreathing apparatus combines a col- lapsible bag reservoir with high-flow O 2and an exhalation valve so that high FiO 2can be delivered. When used optimally, the FiO 2range may approach 0.6-0.8. The current literature supports the use of non- invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) inpatients without hemodynamic compromise,cardiac dysrhythmias, or altered mental status.Therefore, NPPV use in the management ofshock should be limited to patients with respira-tory failure without hemodynamic instability.This literature strongly supports the use ofNPPV in patients with hypercapneic hypoxemicrespiratory failure, such as those with exacerba- tion of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD). Data from descriptive studies regardingits use in selected cases of hypoxemic respiratoryfailure, such as acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS), is available, but prospective ran-domized trials are lacking. Prospective trialsinvestigating NPPV use in CHF with pulmonaryedema suggest that continuous positive airwaypressure (CPAP) is beneficial. Studies utilizingbilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) havebeen small and did not demonstrate benefit. Early generations of non-invasive ventilators bled O 2into the ventilator tubing, so FiO 2was not tightly controlled. O 2flow was increased until the patient's arterial O 2saturation (SaO 2) was optimized. In newer models, the FiO 2can be more precisely set with a mixture valve, and adjusted as needed based on saturationmonitoring.Invasive mechanical ventilation should be considered for any patient who does not achieveadequate SaO 2despite maximal non-invasive O 2 supplementation. All patients who are placed oninvasive ventilation should initially receive anFiO 2of 1.0 because the switch from spontaneous breathing (negative pressure) to assisted ventila-tion (positive pressure) causes unpredictablealterations in pulmonary blood flow and ventila-tion-perfusion mismatch. FiO 2can then be decreased as the patient's SaO 2allows. Patients with pulmonary edema, particularly those withARDS, may require the addition of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to optimize oxygen-ation. Although many factors must be consideredin determining the optimal level of PEEP , mostauthors recommend starting at increased by2-3 allowing 15-30 minutes after each increase for alveolar recruitment. PEEP isincreased until SaO 2reaches a minimum 88-90%. Further increases in PEEP may then be requiredto allow the FiO 2to be decreased to 0.6. As PEEP is increased, the mean intrathoracic pressureincreases. A critical point is reached when venousreturn to the heart is compromised due to increased intrathoracic pressure, impairing cardiacoutput. PEEP should not be increased beyondthe point where hemodynamic compromiseoccurs. Cardiac intervention Pathologic rhythms may be a cause or conse-quence of a shock state. In either scenario, thegoal of therapy should be to convert this to a perfu-sing rhythm. Bradycardic rhythms should be spedup either pharmacologically or electricaltransthoracic or transvenous pacing. Atropine isconsidered the first-line agent in patients with apulse. It should be considered a temporary meas-ure, and preparation for pacing should be rapidlyaccomplished. In contrast, a bradycardiac patientwithout a pulse should receive CPR and alternat-ing doses of epinephrine and atropine whilepreparing to initiate electrical pacing. The principles for electrically pacing the heart are the same for transthoracic and transvenoustechniques. In both modes, the initial HR is setbetween 80 and 100 beats per minute. In thepulseless patient, the output is set at maximum,and dialed downward after the heart demon-strates capture. In contrast, the output is set at a minimum in the patient with a pulse, anddialed upward until capture is achieved. Principles of Emergency Medicine 89ShockIn both scenarios, the final output should be set at 10-20% above the threshold for capture.The causes of failure to capture include malposi-tion of the pacing leads, hypothermia, hypo-glycemia, hypoxemia, acidosis, and electrolytedisturbance. Sinus tachycardia in the shock state is compen- satory. Except in some types of intoxication (sym-pathomimetic or anticholinergic overdose), acuteischemic coronary syndromes, and other unusualcircumstances, measures directed at slowing theHR should be limited to correcting the underlyingcause. All other tachycardias are pathologic, andmay be the etiology for the shock state. Theseshould be converted to a perfusing rhythm by themost rapid means, usually electrical cardiover-sion. The exception to this rule is atrial fibrillation(Afib). Acute Afib, defined as Afib of less than 48hours duration, may be treated with cardiover-sion. Patients with chronic Afib, defined as Afib ofgreater than 48 hours duration, have an increasedrisk of systemic embolization of an atrial throm-bus. Such patients, or those in whom the durationof Afib is unknown, should receive anticoa-gulation or undergo transesophageal echocar-diography before attempts at cardioversion are undertaken. The decision to cardiovert such a patient should be made in consultation with acardiologist. Volume intervention Following initial assessment of the preload,either fluid or diuretic therapy should be insti-tuted. The size of an initial fluid bolus is a matter of clinical judgment. A previously healthy youngadult with acute hemorrhage may safely receiverapid infusion of several liters of a crystalloidsolution. In contrast, a frail, elderly patient with ahistory of CHF may require boluses of only a fewhundred milliliters at a time. The crucial step isreassessment after each intervention to decide whether further volume expansion is indicated. Apatient who is volume overloaded requires diuresis. Loop diuretics, such as furosemide,torsemide, and bumetadine, are the most com-monly used first-line agents. Frequent reassess-ment of the response in urinary output ismandatory to guide subsequent therapy. Otherinterventions that may be employed to lower preload include the administration of B-typenatriuretic peptide (nesiritide), nitrates, opiates,rotating tourniquets, and dialysis. Opiates should be used with caution as they are associated withworse outcomes in acute CHF.Blood transfusion intervention The effect of raising the hemoglobin (Hgb) on O 2 delivery is profound. The administration of 2units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) to increasethe Hgb by 25% (e.g., an increase of hematocritfrom 20% to 25%) will also increase the calcu-lated O 2delivery by 25%. For this reason, admin- istration of blood should be considered in patientswith shock and anemia. Rapid estimation of Hgbis available in most centers by commercially-available analyzers, blood gas machines, or cen-trifuge techniques. The threshold for administration of blood has been dictated by practice habit, and not by theevidence in the medical literature. It is generallyrecommended that adult trauma victims unre- sponsive to initial volume expansion with 2 L ofcrystalloid receive blood transfusion. Patientswith coronary artery disease or CHF should betransfused with a goal of keeping the hematocritabove 30%. Other patients may benefit fromblood therapy if the hematocrit falls below20-24%. Of note, blood therapy has not beendemonstrated to improve survival, decrease theduration of mechanical ventilation, or decreasethe need for vasopressors. Controversy alsoexists because transfused allogenic RBCs mayimpair host immune response, and at carrying O 2than native RBCs. Vasoactive agent intervention Treatment of abnormalities in contractility and afterload should follow correction of preload, par-ticularly in hypovolemic states. Use of vasocon-stricting agents in the setting of volume depletionwill further compromise organ perfusion, causingorgan ischemia and infarction. Many thevasoactive shock affectboth myocardial contractility and SVR. A thor-ough knowledge of the action of adrenergic recep-tor physiology and the action of the vasoactiveagents on these receptors is necessary to guideselection of a vasoactive agent. Alpha-1 ( /H9251-1) receptors are found in arterial smooth muscle and in the conduction system ofthe heart. The physiologic effect of /H9251-1 stimulation is increased cardiac excitation/conduction andarterial (including coronary, cere-bral, renal, and splanchnic arterial beds). Beta-1(/H9252-1) receptors are found in the myocardium and the conduction system. /H9252-1 stimulation results in increased contractility and cardiac excitation.Beta-2 ( /H9252-2) receptors are found in arterial and Shock 90 Principles of Emergency Medicinebronchial smooth muscle. /H9252-2 stimulation results in arterial vasodilation. Vasopressors The vasopressors are listed in Table 5.3, as first- and second-line agents. Table 5.4 provides therelative affinity of the first-line agents at the /H9251and /H9252receptors. Table 5.5 lists the suggested dose ranges.Norepinephrine is predominately an /H9251-1 agon- ist, although it has non-selective /H9252activity as well. At low doses, it raises cardiac output andSVR proportionately, but the potential to raisecardiac output is limited. As the infusion rateincreases, its effect is essentially limited to anincrease in SVR and HR. The primary role of nor-epinephrine is in the treatment of septic shock with hyp otension attributable to low SVR. A con- sensus committee has previously recommendednorepinephrine as the agent of choice in cardio-genic shock with SBP below 70 mmHg. Dopamine activates /H9252receptors moderate dose range (3-8 mcg/kg/minute) both /H9251and /H9252receptors at higher infusion rates ( /H110228mcg/kg/ minute). Clinically, SVR is decreased and cardiacoutput is increased at low doses. At higher doses,SVR increases, blunting further rises in cardiacoutput. Dopamine has been recommended as theagent of choice in patients with cardiogenicshock and SBP between rise in PAOP , limiting its value as an index of left heart preload. Tachyphylaxis todopamine infusion may also occur. Dobutamine activates /H9252receptors throughout its dose range, and is a more potent cardiac stimu-lant than dopamine. It has weaker /H9251receptor activity than dopamine. The balance of the effectof increased cardiac output and decreased SVRcan have a variable effect on MABP . Those patientswith large increases in contractility tend to expe-rience a rise in MABP , while those with a weakincrease in cardiac output in response to dobuta-mine tend to have no change in or diminishedMABP . It is impossible to predict which patientswill respond with incre ased cardiac output; how- ever, younger patients tend to be more responsivethan the elderly. In contrast to dopamine, dobut- amine tends to cause pulmonary vasodilation. Epinephrine is a potent /H9251and /H9252agonist, roughly 500 times more potent than dopamine or dobutamine. It is arrhythmogenic, increasesmyocardial O 2consumption, and causes tachycar- dia. Its use is limited to cardiac arrest, refractorylife-threatening bradycardia, and anaphylacticshock. Phenylephrine is a pure /H9251-1 agonist. It may be useful in the management of vasomotor collapse,as in distributive or neurogenic shock. However,because it is less well studied than the othervasopressors, its routine use is not advocated atpresent. Isoproterenol is a potent /H9252agonist. It causes a marked increase in HR and myocardial O 2 Principles of Emergency Medicine 91Shock Table 5.3 Vasoactive medications and initial dose Table 5.5 Dose ranges of vasoactive agents in adultsFirst-line agents Norepinephrine 1 Dopamine Low dose 0 2 3 Crit Illness June 1, 2001.consumption. Its only role is in the treatment of life-threatening bradycardia. Its use shouldtherefore be limited to failure of electrical cardiacpacing. Amrinone and milrinone are not adrenergic receptor agonists. Instead, they inhibit phospho- diesterase, producing an effect similar to /H9252 agonists. These are second-line agents for thetreatment antidiureticeffects via receptors in the vascular smooth muscleand the kidneys. It has undergone preliminaryinvestigation as an agent for use in septic shock.However, its routine use cannot be advocated untilprospective randomized trials are completed. Pitfalls Failure to recognize early signs of shock,before hypotension develops. Failure to provide early ventilatory support tothe hemodynamically-compromised patient. Inadequate fluid resuscitation of the volume-depleted patient before initiating vasoactiveinfusion. Delay in administration of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics in septic shock. Failure to continuously monitorhemodynamic parameters (Table 5.6) as aguide to titration of fluid therapy andvasoactive infusions. Improper selection of vasoactive agents. Reliance on pulse oximetry as an index ofSaO 2during periods of hypoperfusion, severe hypoxemia, or when a hemoglo-binopathy is present.

Shock 92 Principles of Emergency MedicineTable 5.6 Normal vascular resistance indexPrinciples of Emergency Medicine 93Traumatic injuries Scope of the problem Traumatic injuries account for about 37% of emer- gency department (ED) visits. In 2000, EDs in the US evaluated and treated more than 29.5 million people for injuries. More than 148,000 of thesepeople died as a result of traumatic injuries. Ofthese deaths, 43,354 were the result of motorvehicle crashes, 16,765 from homicide, and 13,322from falls. Each year, approximately 7000 fatalitiesoccur in pedestrians struck by automobiles. Fallsare the number one cause of non-fatal trauma andthe second leading cause of brain injury. Accordingto a 1999 study (using 1993 data), the treatmentand long-term care of injuries cost $69 billion,approximately 12% of medical care expenditures. Patients with severe or life-threatening trau- matic injuries may present to the ED at any timeof day, either immediately following their injuryor in a delayed fashion. They may arrive by ambu-lance having benefited from pre-hospital care and advanced notification, or be \"dropped off\"by a friend or family member. Emergency physi-cians must be skilled at the initial evaluation andtreatment of these patients. Peaks of death Death from traumatic injury tends to occur dur-ing one of three distinct time frames followingthe injury. The first \"peak of death\" occurs withinseconds to minutes of the injury, typically resultingfrom devastating injuries to the central nervoussystem, heart, or major vessels. Very few of thesepatients can be saved. The second \"peak of death\" occurs minutes to hours following the injury. Deaths during thisperiod occur as a result of major head, chest,abdominal or pelvic injuries, as well as injuriesassociated with significant blood loss. During the\"golden hour\" of trauma care, the rapid trans-portation, identification, and resuscitation of theseinjuries is essential to preserving life. Theseinjuries require emergent stabilization and gener-ally surgical intervention. The third \"peak of death\" occurs days to weeks after the original injury. This is most oftenthe result of sepsis or multiorgan failure.Primary survey Initial evaluation of the trauma patient begins withthe primary survey: Airway with cervical spine control Breathing Circulation with hemorrhage control D isability Exposure and environmental control This is a systematic approach to the assessment and simultaneous tr eatment of life-threatening traumatic injuries. It is essential that traumatic life- or limb- threatening injuries are treated at the time they are identified, not after the entire examination iscompleted. Obtaining a detailed patient historyand evaluation for secondary (non-life threaten-ing) injuries are deferred until the secondary sur-vey. This is often difficult because some secondaryinjuries are very dramatic, and human naturedraws us to them. Airway with cervical spine control Assessment The airway should be assessed immediately to make certain that it is both patent and protected.If there is a risk that the patient will not be able tomaintain his or her airway, early interventionmust be considered. Establishment of a secureairway takes precedence over the remainder ofthe trauma evaluation. Listen for stridor and/or dysphonia, as both serve as indicators that the trachea or surround-ing structures have been injured. When either ofthese findings is present, rapid intervention isrequired. Assess the patient for agitation, obtundation, and cyanosis. These findings may be indirectsigns that the patient is not adequately oxygena-ting or ventilating, resulting in hypoxia or hypercarbia. Examine the patient for the presence of facial fractures that may lead to bleeding or airwayobstruction. Carefully remove the front of the cer-vical collar (while pr oviding spinal stabilization)6T raumatic injuries David E. Manthey, MDTraumatic injuries 94 Principles of Emergency Medicineto look for evidence of penetrating injuries, subcutaneous emphysema, or an expandinghematoma of the anterior neck. Determine if thetrachea is midline. Deviation of the trachea maybe associated with a local hematoma or tensionpneumothorax. Open the patient's mouth carefully to identify abnormalities such as bleeding or swelling. The gentle use of a tongue blade may facilitate thistask. Can the patient swallow and handle secre-tions? Some trauma patients arrive at the ED after intubation in the field. Do not assume that theairway is secure. Correct endotracheal (ET) tubeplacement may be confirmed by the direct visual-ization of the ET tube passing through the vocal cords, the presence of a normal oxygen saturation,and the detection of end-tidal carbon dioxide(CO 2). Other measures to assess ET tube place- ment include auscultation of symmetric breathsounds over the chest, the absence of breathsounds over the epigastrium, fogging within theET tube, symmetric chest rise with ventilation,and the esophageal bulb detection device.However, these methods are not as reassuring asdirect visualization and the detection of end-tidal CO 2. Assume injury to the cervical spine in any patient with the following findings: multi-system or major trauma; altered level of consciousness; blunt injury above the clavicles; appropriate mechanism of injury; neck pain, ecchymosis or deformity; neurologic deficits.Treatment All trauma patients should receive supplemental oxygen regardless of their oxygen saturation.Oxygenation may be monitored with a pulseoximeter if an appropriate waveform can beidentified. The tongue remains the most common reason for airway obstruction. When a patient is supine orunconscious, the tongue can be raised by maneu-vers such as the chin lift or jaw thrust, or withdevices such as the nasopharyngeal or oropharyn-geal airway. The neck should neither be flexed norextended if a cervical spine injury is suspected orthe patient is unconscious (Figure 6.1). The air-way should remain clear of debris and vomit bya manual sweep or a suction device. Atrauma patient should be intubated for any of the following reasons: apnea or inadequate ventilation; protection from aspiration; impending or suspected airway compromise; hypoxia despite supplemental oxygen; closed head injury with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) /H110219. Acomplete approach to controlling a patient's airway is described in Chapter 2. An or ganized approach in a stepwise pattern should utilize oneor the following lift/jaw thrust/nasopharyngeal The use of adjunctive airways and simple maneuversto lift the tongue out of the pharynx oftenallows ventilation of the patient until adefinitive airway can be established. (a) (b) Figure 6.1 (a) A patient with an extension teardrop fracture of the vertebral body of C2. (b) Inadvertent hyperextension of the patient'sneck could lead to subluxation of the vertebral bodies and injury to the spinal cord. Courtesy :Michael Zucker, MD.Principles of Emergency Medicine 95Traumatic injuries(b)Bag-valve mask (BVM): Every clinician should be skilled at ventilating a patient using a BVM, which allows ventilation of an apneic patient or patient with r espiratory distress until a definitive airway can beestablished. Providing a good mask seal andensuring that the tongue does not obstructthe pharynx are essential for effective BVMventilation. (c)Intubation: ET intubation can be performed by direct laryngoscopy, over an endoscope or guidewire, or through alaryngeal mask airway (LMA). Directlaryngoscopy is safe in the trauma patient when performed with in-lineimmobilization to protect the cervical spine. Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) mayfacilitate intubation of a patient withoutrequiring bag-valve mask ventilation. However, prior to paralyzing the patient, it is important to assess for a difficult airwayand ensure that the patient can be effectively BVM-ventilated should the intubation provedifficult or impossible. (d)Transtracheal jet ventilation : When intubation fails, ventilation using a needle placedthrough the cricothyroid membrane willtemporarily allow oxygenation of thepatient. (e)Surgical cricothyroidotomy : This surgical airway may be necessary when ET intubation either fails or is not feasible. It involves incising the cricothyroidmembrane to allow placement of an ET or tracheostomy tube directly into thetrachea (Figure 6.2).Breathing Assessment Evaluation of the patient's breathing determines how well the patient is oxygenating and ventila-ting. Employ a pulse oximeter to assess oxygena-tion and, if available, a quantitative end-tidal CO 2 monitor to assess ventilation. An arterial bloodgas will assess both oxygenation and ventilation,and provides the patient's acid-base status, whichis often related to the adequacy of resuscitationefforts. Auscultate the lungs for bilateral symmetric breath sounds. The lack of breath sounds on oneside may indicate a pneumothorax or hemothorax.The clinician should search for signs of a tension pneumothorax, such as a deviated trachea awayfrom the affected side, distended neck veins,decreased breath sounds on the affected side,and hypotension (Figure 6.3). Percussion of the chest may help differentiate a pneumothorax from a hemothorax. However,this technique may be of limited utility during anoisy trauma resuscitation. Observe the chest wall for symmetric rise as well as for any paradoxical movement suggestiveof a flail chest (Figure 6.4). Flail chest is caused by the fracture of two or more ribs at two or moresegments, causing a free-floating segment thatmoves inward with inspiration due to negativepressure generated. Palpate the entire thorax (anterior and poste- rior) for crepitus and rib tenderness. Crepitussuggests an underlying pneumothorax, while ribtenderness alerts the physician to a possible ribfracture and underlying pulmonary contusion. Look for an open (sucking) chest wound. If the chest wound is two-thirds the size of the patient's trachea or larger, air can preferen-tially enter the thoracic cavity through this chestwall injury, resulting in a tension or open pneumo-thorax. Treatment When evaluating a trauma patient's respiratory status, one must keep in mind life-threateningconditions that must be addressed. These includehypoxia, tension pneumothorax, open pneumo-thorax, massive hemothorax, tracheo-bronchial treedisruption, and flail segment. Hypoxia should be treated with supplemental oxygen. Intubation should be performed if neces- sary. A diligent search for reversible causes ofimpaired ventilation should occur. Figure 6.2 Surgical cricothyroidotomy.

Reproduced from D.Mandavia et al, Color Atlas of Emergency Trauma , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2003.Emergent treatment of a tension pneumo- thorax converts it to a simple pneumothorax. This can be accomplished by needle decompression(needle thoracostomy) using a 14-G catheter overneedle (Figure 6.5). Insertion of the needle overthe third rib (second intercostal space) in the mid-clavicular line r esults in a release of intrapleural air and the subsequent reversal of adverse hemo-dynamic effects. The catheter is left in place untila 36-French chest tube is promptly placed at the4th intercostal space in the mid-axillary line(chest tube thoracostomy). An pneumothorax allows air to preferen- tially enter the thoracic cavity through the defect rather than the trachea. This results in significanthypoxia, increased work of breathing, and hyper-carbia. This wound should be treated with an air occlusive dressing (such as a defibrillator pad orVaseline gauze) taped on three sides to produce a flutter valve (Figure 6.6). This type of dressing will prevent the entrance of air into the pleuralspace during inhalation but allow the escape ofintrapleural air during exhalation. Amassive hemothorax (Figure 6.7) is identi- fied by more than 1500 ml of blood within thethoracic cavity. It is initially treated and diag-nosed with a tube thoracostomy. The use of anauto-transfuser with the pleuravac will allow thisblood to be infused back to the patient. Continuedbleeding (the drainage of /H11022200ml of blood per hour for 2-4 hours), blood transfusions, or thepatient's hemodynamic status dictate the needfor operative intervention (thoracotomy). Aflail segment occurs when two or more con- tiguous ribs are broken in two or more places.The paradoxical movement of this segment, therestricted chest wall movement due to pain, and the underlying pulmonary contusion lead tohypoxia and ineffective ventilation.

Intubation with positive pressure ventilation is often requiredto treat this injury. Circulation Assessment Shock is defined by inadequate organ perfusion and tissue oxygenation, not by a specific bloodpressure measurement. A patient with a low bloodpressure may continue to perfuse well, as evi-denced by normal mentation, skin temperature,and color. Alternatively, a \"normal\" measuredblood pressure may be found in a patient who isnot adequately perfusing his or her vital organs. Hypovolemia, typically from hemorrhage, is the most common cause of shock in traumapatients. Most preventable trauma deaths resultfromthe failure to recognize and adequately treat hemorrhagic shock. Always assume that hypo-volemic shock is present, and treat it until provenotherwise. Familiarity with the classes of hypo-volemic shock is important, as they correlate withblood loss and help guide therapy (Table 6.1).Other causes of shock in the trauma patientinclude neurogenic shock (from spinal cord injury),obstructive shock (from cardiac tamponade), anddistributive shock (from sepsis). Cardiogenicshock may be the initial cause of a traumaticinjury, but is rarely the result of one. Evaluation of a patient's circulatory status can be difficult. Use all available options when assess-inga trauma patient for the presence of shock. Assess the patient's mental status. Confusion,restlessness, combativeness or unconsciousness may all result from shock. Other causes of alteredmental status in the trauma patient include headinjury or intoxication. Check and re-check the patient's vital signs. The presence of hypotension suggests a signifi-cant shock state. However, children and healthyadults can maintain their blood pressure in theface of severe blood loss, although other signs ofshock will usually be apparent. Calculate the pulse pressure, which is the dif- ference between the systolic and diastolic bloodpressure. A narrowed pulse pressure may reflectperipheral vasoconstriction occuring in order tomaintain cardiac output. The patient's pulse may be elevated due to hypovolemia, or secondary to pain and stress.The earliest manifestations of shock includetachycardia and cutaneous vasoconstriction. Thepulse may also be misleadingly normal due to theinability to develop tachycardia secondary to age, Cyanosis Neck veins flatBreath sounds absent; dull topercussion ShockRespiratory difficulty as a late symptom Figure 6.7 Massive hemothorax.

Examine the patient's extremities. Delayed capillary refill time ( /H110222seconds) may reflect decreased peripheral perfusion. Cool, moist, orpale extremities suggest shock. Always compare peripheral and central pulses. If the central pulses are markedly stronger thanthe peripheral pulses, this may be a sign of periph-eralvasoconstriction in order to preserve preload and maintain cardiac output. Evaluate the patient's jugular veins. Flat jugu- lar veins suggest hypovolemia. Full neck veinsare normal in the recumbent patient. Distendedjugular veins suggest an obstructive process.When combined with impending shock, thisfinding suggests cardiac tamponade (Figure 6.8),tension pneumothorax, or cardiogenic shock inthe trauma patient. Assess the patient's urinary output. It should be at least 0.5 ml/kg/hour in the adult patient,1ml/kg/hour in the pediatric patient and 2 ml/ kg/hour in children /H110211 year of age. Decreased urine output may reflect poor renal perfusionsecondary to continued hypovolemia and under-resuscitation. The assessment of a patient's circulatory sta- tus is an ongoing process. When resuscitating thepatient with the crystalloid, it is important todetermine how the patient responds to each fluidchallenge. Treatment During the assessment of the patient's circulation, one must stop all obvious external bleeding. Directpressure or a compression bandage accomplishesthis in most instances. In some cases, placing ahemostatic figure-of-eight stitch over the bleedingarea may be required. Blind probing or clampingdeep within a wound should be avoided. Venous access is required in all trauma patients for the administration of isotonic fluidsand blood (if necessary). Two large-bore intra-venous (IV) catheters (16 G or larger) are pre-ferred. Short, large-caliber peripheral IVs allowthe rapid infusion of large volumes of fluid. If thepatient's condition prevents placement of periph-eral IVs, a central venous catheter may be placed Principles of Emergency Medicine 99Traumatic injuries Table 6.1 Estimated blood loss, signs and treatment for classes of shock Class of shock Blood loss Signs Treatment Class I 0-750 ml (up to 15% of Tachycardia PO fluids (if not NPO), blood volume) IV crystalloid fluids Class II 750-1500 ml (15-30% Tachycardia IV crystalloid fluidsof blood volume) Tachypnea Pulse pressure narrows Class III 1500-2000 ml (30-40% Tachycardia ( /H11022120) IV crystalloid fluids, packed RBCs pulse RBCs: red blood cells.

Aperipheral venous cutdown may be performed on the saphenous vein. In children /H110218 years of age, intraosseous placement of a needle may provide rapid vascular access as the primaryapproach or if peripheral IV access fails. Fluid resuscitation should be given rapidly, up to a predetermined amount. The patient's hemo-dynamic response should be evaluated after thisinitial bolus. Patients who respond quickly maynot need further fluids or blood, as they may havelimited blood loss. Patients who respond onlytransiently are likely to have ongoing blood loss,requiring further resuscitation with fluids and likely blood products. These patients require arapid search for the cause of their blood loss.Patients who do not respond to the initial bolusrequire additional resuscitation with blood and fluids. An emergent trip to the operating room(OR) may be required to diagnose the source ofbleeding, as well as control it. Finally, considerother causes for hemodynamic compromise, suchas neurogenic or cardiogenic shock, which requirealternate therapeutic approaches. Blood products should be used for patients who remain hemodynamically unstable or whohave ongoing blood loss requiring replacement.When there is no time to type and screen a patient,type O blood should be utilized. Administer Rh-negative blood to women of childbearing age.When it is available, administer ABO type-specificand Rh-compatible blood. This blood can be ready approximately 15 minutes after the blood bankreceives the type and screen specimen. Type and crossmatched blood is the best source to avoidincompatibility reactions, but requires over anhour to obtain. Depending on the etiology of the shock state, the physician may utilize other procedures such as: 1.needle decompression followed by tube thoracostomy pericardialwindow or pelvic angiography withembolization of bleeding vessels for thetreatment of displaced pelvic fractures. An ED thoracotomy is indicated for a pene- trating chest trauma patient who loses vital signs within a few minutes of arriving at or within theED. This procedure should only be performed ifthe hospital has the facilities and staff to addressthe injury. A thoracotomy allows for definitivetreatment toprevent ongoing blood loss, and clamping thepulmonary arteries.

Campbell, John E., Basic Trauma Life Support for Advanced Providers, 5th ed., Copyright2004. Reprinted by permission of Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.Often the patient may leave the ED for the OR during the circulation assessment portion of the primary resuscitation. This may be necessary toobtain control of active bleeding within the chestor abdominal cavity. Disability Assessment Assessment of the patient's disability during the primary survey should be brief and directed tothe following three areas: level of consciousness,pupillary examination, and movement of extrem-ities. It is always important to assess neurologic function prior to paralysis of the patient as partof rapid sequence intubation (RSI). Assess the level of consciousness with the AVPU approach or the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). AVPU relates to the patient's level ofresponse: the patient may be Alert, respond to Voice or Pain, or remain Unresponsive. The GCS (Table 6.2) is used to follow the patient's status, guide therapy, and communicatewith consultants. Scores range from a minimumof 3 to a maximum of 12, with a score of 8 or lessindicating coma. A GCS drop of two is consid-ered deterioration, while a drop of three is con-sidered a catastrophic change. The pupil examination should look for pupil symmetry and reactivity to light. A dilated, patientsuggests transtentorial to unilateral compression of the third cra-nial nerve. Disconjugate gaze may be associatedwith various etiologies of coma. Assessment of movement in all extremities is a gross evaluation of spinal cord function, notperipheral nerve function. It is more important tojudge symmetry and strength in all extremities than isolated peripheral nerve function. Treatment The two most dangerous insults to the trauma- tized brain, hypoxia and hypotension, should beaddressed during the initial evaluation andresuscitation. ET intubation is indicated in any patient with a GCS /H110219. In cases of neurologic deterioration or lateral- izing neurologic signs, mannitol and controlledhyperventilation to a partial pressure of carbondioxide (PCO 2) between 30 and 35 mmHg may be employed as temporizing measures to reduceintracranial pressure. Other therapies to considerin the severely brain injured patient include anti-convulsants, deep sedation, and elevating thehead of the Neurosurgical proceduressuch as operative craniotomy, skull trephinationwith burr hole placement (Figures 6.9a and b), orintraventricular pressure monitor placement areoften required.

However, once the stability of the spine has beenassessed, the patient may be carefully log rolledoff the spine board to prevent skin breakdownand minimize patient discomfort. For patients with acute spinal cord injuries, rapid IV administration of high-dose steroids has been recommended, although this treatmentremains controversial. Early discussion with neurosurgical consultants is recommended. Exposure and environmental control Assessment Fully undress the victim from \"head to toe\" to allow a complete assessment. Look under collarsand splints, in the axilla and under skin folds,and log roll the patient to examine the back and buttocks. Identify and treat any active sitesof bleeding. Failure to completely expose thepatient may result in missing a significant trau-matic injury, such as a gunshot or stab wound(Figure 6.10).

Courtesy :Clement Yeh, MD.Treatment Remove all wet or contaminated clothing. If the patient has been in an industrial or chemical acci-dent, decontamination is critical for patient care.It is also critical that the medical staff protectthemselves from exposure, morbidity, and inca-pacitation. Keep the patient warm by raising the temper- ature of the resuscitation room, applying warmblankets, ventilating with warm humidified air,and administering warmed IV fluids. Hypother-mia in trauma patients is associated with increasedmortality, and should be prevented. The patient'schance of survival may drop with every degreedrop in core temperature. Secondary survey This detailed head to toe examination is initiatedonly after life-threatening injuries have beenevaluated and treated during the primary sur-vey. At that time, multiple other evaluations mayoccur, including trauma radiographs and labora-tory studies. Although there are a multitude ofitems to address in each anatomical area, whatfollows is a review of items specific to trauma. 1.Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT)(a)Assess for evidence of a basilar skullfracture by identifying the presence ofBattle's sign (ecchymosis over themastoid) (Figure 6.11), Raccoon eyes(ecchymosis around the eyes) (Figure 6.12) or hemotympanum (blood behind the eardrum) (Figure 6.13). Lookfor a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak manifested by rhinorrhea (b)Assess for depressed skull fractures bycareful foreignbodies and bone fragments should notbe manipulated. (c)Assess for facial injury and stability bypalpating the facial bones. Severe facialfractures can lead to airway compromiseand may alter the approach to theairway. Malocclusion of the teeth mayindicate a mandible fracture (d)Look for lacerations that will requirerepair. Unattended scalp lacerations can bleed vigorously.

(c)The sign\" iscorrelated an eight-fold higherrelative risk of intraperitoneal injury (Figure 6.15).(d)Reliable assessment of the abdomen maybe compromised by the presence ofaltered mental status, intoxication withalcohol or illicit drugs, or the presence ofpainful distracting injuries. 5.Back(a)Log roll the patient with assistance whilemaintaining spinal alignment.

(b)Assess for hidden wounds in the axilla,under the cervical collar, and in thegluteal region. 6.Pelvis(a)In order to assess the stability of thepelvis, the physician may gently employ anterior-posterior compression only, as vigorous manipulationof the bony pelvis may exacerbatebleeding from the symphysis pubis for pain,crepitus, or fractures can be responsible for asmuch as 4-6 L of occult blood loss. 7.Perineum(a)Evaluate the perineum for ecchymosis,suggestive of a pelvic fracture orurethral disruption. 8.Urethra(a)Look for blood at the urethral meatus toassess for possible urethral disruptionbefore placing a urinary catheter.

(d)Femur fractures can result in as much as2 units of occult blood loss. 12.Neurologic(a)At this time, a complete neurologicexamination should be done. Thisincludes a repeat GCS score, re-evaluation of the pupils, a cranial nerveexamination, a complete sensory andmotor examination, testing of the deeptendon reflexes, and an assessment ofthe response to plantar stimulation. History Where and how were you injured (shot,struck)? Where are you hurting? An understanding of the mechanism of injury may provide clues to the type(s) of injuries seenin trauma patients (Table 6.3). Significant injuriesmay occur without obvious external evidence oftrauma. The cervical spine is a classic example. Did you lose consciousness? Although many argue about the significance of the duration of unconsciousness, most agree thatits presence should increase concern for an intra-cranial injury. Principles of Emergency Medicine 105Traumatic injuries Table 6.3 Mechanisms of traumatic injury and associated injuries Mechanism Possible traumatic injury Steering column damage Myocardial or pulmonary contusion Sudden deceleration (fall, cervical injuryRear impact, head turned to side Jumped cervical facetSide impact Fractured hipSeat belt sign, stab wound below Intra-abdominal injury the nipple or scapular tip Fall, landing on heels Tibial plateau fracture, lumbar spine fracture, calcaneal fracture Direct blow to head Coup and contre-coup brain injuriesBlast injury Air-containing body cavities most vulnerable High kinetic energy missile (bullet) Injury extends beyond bullet woundMVC: motor vehicle collision.What amount of blood loss occurred at the scene/en route? Quantifying this amount may be difficult, but recognizing that the patient has already lost a significant amount of blood will guide therapy. What was the temperature at the scene? Assesses the potential for hypothermia or hyper- thermia. What was the direction of impact? This allows clinicians to ascertain the forces imposed upon the body and identify associatedinjuries, such as a jumped facet in the cervicalspine. What was the appearance of the vehicle? This includes damage to the steering wheel, star- ring of the windshield, and intrusion of the doorinto the passenger compartment. Report of thisinformation, or a photo allows an estimation ofthe amount of kinetic energy delivered to thepatient (Figure 6.16). What was your position in the car? Knowledge of both damage to the car and the patient's position in the car allow the clinician to better ascertain what the patient's injuriesmight be. What was the speed of the vehicle (if isolated collision) or vehicles? What type ofvehicle(s) were involved? Remember that energy equals mass times veloc- ity squared, so you need to know the mass andvelocity to determine the amount of force trans-mitted. Larger cars, sport utility vehicles (SUVs),and trucks that ride higher off the ground gener-ally protect the passenger more than small, lightvehicles. Traumatic injuries 106 Principles of Emergency Medicine Figure 6.16 Side impact motor vehicle collision with passenger space intrusion. Campbell, John E., Basic Trauma Life Support for Advanced Providers, 5th ed., Copyright 2004. Reprinted by permission of Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.Did you use restraining devices? Ask about the use of seat belts (including shoulder and lap, or lap-only restraints) and the deploy-ment of air bags. Did their vehicle roll over? Was there a fatality at the scene? Affirmative answers to any of these questions raise the likelihood of serious injury. Were you wearing a helmet? For patients of motorcycle or bicycle crashes, this information is important given the amount of pro-tection that helmets afford the brain. Evaluation of the helmet is also important to determine theamount of force distributed to the head.How far did you fall and what did you land on? Both the height of the fall and the hardness of the surface the patient struck are important in deter-mining the likelihood of injury and the body partsinjured. What caused the fall? Did the patient have a seizure or syncope which caused the fall? Was the fall preceded by chestpain or difficulty breathing? Was alcohol involved?Was this a suicide attempt? Did an explosion occur? What was the patient's distance from the blast? Blast injuries may occur from the primary blastforce, secondary missiles, or due to tertiary impactagainst a hard surface (Figure 6.17). Principles of Emergency Medicine 107Traumatic injuries Primary blast forceSecondary missile, etc.being propelled Injuries:Tertiary impact hard surface multiple injuries possible1. Ears2. Lungs3. GI tractBlast Figure 6.17 Blast injury. Explosions can cause injury with the initial blast, when the victim is struck by debris, or by the victim beingthrown against the ground or other fixed objects by the blast. Campbell, John E., Basic Trauma Life Support for AdvancedProviders, 5th ed., Copyright 2004. Reprinted by permission of Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.How many shots were fired? This question may help determine if you are miss- ingan injury or if the wounds may represent two separate entrance wounds rather than a singlewound (entrance and exit). Do you know what type of weapon was used? Although this is notoriously unreliable, knowl- edge of the type of weapon and the bullet'svelocity may help determine the injury pattern.The length and width of the blade in a stabwound may also assist with patient evaluation.Additionally, for stab wounds, the hand domi-nance and gender of the attacker may provideuseful information if it is known. What were you struck with? Being struck with a bat or pipe versus a fist implies a greater magnitude of force applied tothe tissue, suggesting the possibility of a largeramount of external and internal damage. Was this a crush injury? If so, ascertain the weight and force of the object that struck the patient. Were there any drugs (including alcohol) at the scene? Ask this question of emergency medical system (EMS) providers in addition to querying thepatient about his or her use of drugs. This isimportant in the assessment of mental status andestablishing the patient's reliability. Associated symptoms Did you experience any symptoms (chestpain, seizure, abdominal pain, headache,etc.) before the collision? It is possible that the patient may have had a col- lision resulting from a medical problem. Alwaysgive consideration to these conditions as a possi-ble cause of the incident. Furthermore, these conditions may be exacerbated by the stress ofthe incident. Past medical Can you tell me your AMPLE history? Always take an \"AMPLE\" history from the patient or EMS providers. This information will help clinicians if the patient subsequently becomesnon-communicative: When was your last tetanus? As almost all trauma patients have some degree of injury to skin coupled with contamination(tetanus-prone), it is important to inquire aboutthe patient's immunization status. This questioncan wait until the end of the evaluation. Tetanusstatus should be updated according to acceptedguidelines. Do you have a bleeding disorder or are you taking anticoagulant medication? Patients with bleeding disorders or taking anti- coagulant medication (Coumadin) may bleedsignificantly following even minor trauma; thethreshold to search for occult bleeding is lower. It isimportant to get this information early on to allowtimely administration of whatever factor or prod-uctis needed for correcting any abnormalities. Are you taking any medication that wouldlimit your cardiovascular response? Patients taking certain medications (i.e., beta block- ersor calcium channel blockers), and patients with pacemakers may present with a \"relativebradycardia\" (a normal heart rate despite signifi-cant blood loss). Differential diagnosis Although not an exhaustive list, injuries that canbe elusive or determined by physical exam-ination have been included (Table 6.4). Diagnostic testing Laboratory studies Type and crossmatch Atype and cross should be obtained immediately on all significant trauma patients.

Complete blood count Acomplete blood count (CBC) may be mislead- ing. The white blood cell (WBC) is often elevated due to demargination of WBCs during the stressresponse and is unlikely due to infection. A hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dl ina trauma patient indicates clinically significantanemia. Conversely, a normal initial hemoglobinlevel does not exclude significant hemorrhage. Apatient's hemoglobin value is not a real-timeindicator of his or her intravascular blood vol-ume. It takes many minutes to hours beforehemoglobin value accurately reflects the degreeof blood loss in trauma patients. Following thetrend of serial hemoglobin measurements every15 to 30 minutes can provide useful informationregarding ongoing blood loss. Coagulation studies Although these are often normal early in the treat- ment of a trauma patient, early identification and aggressive treatment of the inability to clot isimportant, especially in patients receiving anti-coagulants. Electrolytes and renal function Routine assessment of electrolyte status and kid- ney function is important, as patients are likely toreceive contrast for imaging studies or may have baseline renal insufficiency. Serious electrolyteimbalances should be recognized and treateddepending on their role and risk to the patient. Arterial blood gas An arterial blood gas assesses both oxygenation (PaO 2- partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood) and ventilation (PaCO 2- partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood) of a patient.Many trauma surgeons utilize the base deficit to assess the patien t's response to resuscitation efforts. The presence of an increased base deficit (/H110916) or decreased serum bicarbonate may signify a metabolic acidosis resulting from acute blood loss and under-resuscitation. Lactate The body produces lactate during anaerobic glycolysis which occurs during a shock state. Alactate may be followed to identify the adequacyof resuscitation. Drug screen Many institutions routinely obtain a urine drug screen on all trauma patients. This policy haslimited utility, as most illicit drugs do not havespecific antidotes (with the exception of opiates)and only require supportive care. Additionally,by the time the levels return, the condition as itrelates to the traumatic injury should have already been identified and treated. Pregnancy The presence of a first trimester pregnancy does little to change the evaluation of a trauma patient.However, a positive pregnancy test may influencethe selection of medication and the use of radio-graphic studies. Urinalysis Hypotension with microscopic hematuria requires an assessment of the renal system. In most cases,however, this will have already occurred beforethe formal urinalysis result returns. Electrocardiogram The electrocardiogram (ECG) has limited utility inthe trauma patient. An ECG should be obtainedif a myocardial infarction is suspected or dysrhyth-mia is present, or as an aid to identifying the cause of trauma. An ECG and cardiac monitoringare recommended in cases of suspected trau-matic cardiac injury, although the evaluation ofthis diagnostic entity remains controversial. Radiologic studies Trauma radiographs should include an antero- posterior (AP) chest, AP pelvis, and cervicalspine series. Chest X-ray Achest radiograph is useful to assess for pneumo- thorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, and rib fractures (Figures 6.18a and b). It also allowsfor the early nonspecific assessment of an aorticinjury by demonstrating a widened mediastinumor blurring of aortic knob (Figure 6.19).

It allows for early identification of serious pelvic injuriesthat may be a source of blood loss, and may also detect proximal femur fractures and hip dislocations. Cervical spine X-ray Most trauma centers obtain at least a three-view plain film series of the cervical spine to assess forfracture, subluxation, and dislocation. The NEXUS cervical spine criteria identify low-risk trauma patients who do not require cer-vical spine radiography. Patients who meet all ofthe following five clinical criteria are at extremelylow risk for cervical spine injury: 1.normal level of consciousness, 2.no painful distracting injuries, 3.no evidence of intoxication, 4.no posterior midline cervical tenderness, 5.no focal neurologic deficits.Ultrasound The Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) examination has become a widely utilized tool in the evaluation of the trauma patient. The FAST exam has the advantages ofbeing quick, non-invasive, and performed concur-rently with the trauma resuscitation. The purpose of the FAST examination is the rapid identificationof free fluid (presumably blood) in the peritonealcavity or pericardial space. The FAST examina-tion may be repeated as many times as necessary.In skilled hands, the FAST examination providesan attractive alternative to diagnostic peritoneallavage (DPL) in unstable trauma patients. Adetailed description of the FAST examination canbe found in Appendix nostic for the evaluation of hemodynami-cally stable trauma patients. CT scanning iscommonly performed of the head, cervical spine,chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The advent of helical Traumatic injuries 112 Principles of Emergency Medicine Figure 6.19 AP supine chest radiograph demonstrating widening of and apical pleural capping suggestive an underlyingaortic injury.

The use ofreformatted CT images aids in the detection and characterization of subtle traumatic injuries.However, since most CT scanners are locatedoutside of the ED, the decision to send a patientto the CT scanner should be made only aftercareful assessment of a patient's clinical condi-tion (i.e., hemodynamic status) and the likelihoodof hemodynamic decline. Angiography Many specialty centers have angiography suites designed for treatment of certain traumatic vas-cular injuries. In skilled hands, with the right staff,embolization of bleeding vessels can control orstop hemorrhage from pelvic fractures or othervascular sources with success rates approachingor surpassing those from surgery. It is importantthat the ED staff, trauma team, and angiographystaff work together regarding the managementof these challenging patients. Additional therapies Anasogastric tube may decompress the stomach and decrease the risk of aspiration. However,nasogastric tube insertion is contraindicated inthe presence of midface fractures. mayresult in the inadvertent insertion of the nasogas- tric tube through a fractured cribriform plate intothe cranial vault (Figure 6.20). An orogastric tubecan still be placed in this circumstance if donecarefully. Atransurethral bladder (Foley) catheter monitors urine output, a sensitive indicator ofrenal perfusion and volume status. The Foley catheter is contraindicated if a urethral injury issuspected as suggested by hematoma. With any of these findings, a retrograde urethro- gram may be necessary to exclude urethral injury prior to Foley catheter insertion. Consider IV antibiotics and tetanus adminis- tration for traumatic wounds. In patients withopen fractures, empiric prophylactic antibioticsshould be administered as soon as possible afterthe injury.Remember to treat pain early. It is important to frequently reassess the patient's need for addi-tional pain medications. Special patients Pediatric Pediatric trauma patients require specialized management with r espect to almost all portions of care. Physicians experienced in managingpedi atric trauma and post-trauma care at centers experienced in pediatrics should assume this responsibility. Airway management of a child may be more difficult than an adult due to anatomical differ-ences, such as a larger head, more prominenttongue, anterior larynx, and floppy epiglottis.Children commonly develop shock due to respi-ratory compromise rather than cardiac causes, soairway and breathing must be assessed andaddressed rapidly and repeatedly. Children may maintain their blood pressure until impending hemodynamic collapse.Hypotension in a child is a dangerous and oftenpremorbid condition. Vascular access in children iscommonly difficult. The use of an intraosseous Principles of Emergency Medicine 113Traumatic injuries Figure 6.20 Computed tomography scout film reveals intracranialplacement of a nasogastric tube in a patient with severecraniofacial trauma.

Isotonic crystalloid fluid boluses should be given in 20 ml/kg amounts, withblood given in 10 ml/kg aliquots to patients notresponding to crystalloid. As the ribs are more pliable in children, signif- icant injury to the lungs may occur withoutexternal evidence of injury. Identification of ribfractures in young children suggests a massiveenergy transfer and the possibility of severeunderlying organ injury. The liver often pro-trudes below the protective rib margin, and istherefore at greater risk for injury. Head injuries in children are often devastat- ing, as little room exists for brain swelling.Damage to the spinal cord and resulting neuro-logic injury may occur without evidence ofspinal column fracture. This condition is knownas SCIWORA (Spinal Cord Injury WithoutRadiographic Abnormality). The GCS is modi-fied for pediatrics by altering the pediatric verbalscore for children /H110214 years of age (Table 6.5). Due to the increased body surface area-to- volume ratio of children, they are prone to develophypothermia more quickly than adults. Preven-tion of heat loss is of tremendous importance inpediatric trauma patients. Elderly The elderly population is extremely prone to fallsand subsequent injury. Decreased coordination,muscle strength, vision, and fine motor skillsneeded for driving place the elderly popula-tion at greater risk of injury. The evaluation ofelderly patients may be more challenging due tochanges in their anatomy and physiology. Thesepatients often lack the cardiovascular reservenecessary to respond to hypovolemia, and maynot develop tachycardia. Decreased sensitivity of the peritoneal cavity due to aging allows thesepatients to have a benign abdominal examina-tion despite catastrophic disease. As the brainatrophies, it is displaced from the inner skull,which creates a space spanned by bridging vessels. These vessels are more prone to injuryduring impact, and this additional space mayhide clinical signs of intracranial bleeding for anunspecified period of time. Pregnant Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) suggeststhat a qualified trauma surgeon and obstetricianshould be consulted early in the evaluation of thepregnant trauma patient. However, the initialevaluation and management priorities of a preg-nant woman remain unchanged. The best carefor the fetus is to provide optimal care to themother, with early assessment of the fetus. Thisincludes adequate fluid resuscitation, preventionof maternal hypoxia or hypercarbia, and under-standing the physiologic changes that occur inpregnancy. After approximately the 10th week, pregnant women develop both an increased cardiac outputand plasma volume. This cardiac output can bemarkedly decreased if the uterus sits on the infe-rior vena cava when the patient is supine after 20weeks gestation. This supine hypotension syndrome may occur in a pregnant patient immobilized ona backboard. It is important to elevate the rightside of the board or manually displace the graviduterus to the left to relieve this pressure. This alteration in physiology means that the pregnant trauma patient may sustain a largeramount of blood loss before showing clinicalsigns. Accordingly, the fetus may be in shock eventhough the mother appears stable. Direct evalua-tion of the fetus is accomplished by cardiotocogra-phy for a minimum of 4 hours, to evaluate uterinecontractions and fetal cardiac activity. The pregnant patient should be assessed for vaginal bleeding or leakage of amniotic fluid.Although the uterus and pelvis provides anadditional cushion for the fetus, lack of abdomi-nal injury to the mother does not exclude the Traumatic injuries 114 Principles of Emergency MedicineTable 6.5 Modified Glasgow Coma Scale for preverbal children Eye opening Spontaneous 4To verbal command 3 To pain 2 None 1 Verbal response Coos, babbles 5 Cries, consolable 4Persistently irritable (cries) 3 Restless, agitated (moans) 2No response 1 Motor response Spontaneous 6Withdraws to voice 5Withdraws to pain 4Abnormal flexion 3Abnormal extension 2No response 1possibility of significant injury to the fetus, uterus, or placenta. AKleihauer-Betke (KB) acid elution test on maternal blood should be performed to assessfor fetomaternal hemorrhage. Its purpose in theED is to screen woman at risk forlarge fetomaternal hemorrhage that exceeds the Rhogam. Rhimmunoglobulin (RhIG) can effectively preventRh isoimmunization if administered within 72 hours of exposure to the Rh antigen. All Rh-negative pregnant trauma patients should beconsidered for RhIG therapy. Remember toadminister O negative blood if a type and cross-match is not feasible. As a rule, all pregnant women who sustain trauma of any type should be considered as vic-tims of intimate partner violence (IPV). Pregnantpatients are far too often assaulted, kicked, orpushed during arguments, without being consid-ered as victims. In fact, many abused pregnantwomen do not consider themselves victims of vio-lence. It is common for women in this situation tobe afraid to describe the details of their injury.Also, it is common that their injuries do not fit themechanism they describe. Fear of being alone,intimidation, subsequent acts of violence, or los-ing financial support are only a few reasons fornot reporting IPV . Social services, police involve-ment, housing assistance and emotional supportshould be provided under such circumstances. Disposition Although most EMS providers have establishedguidelines for transporting trauma patients tospecific trauma centers, every ED should be pre-pared to handle patients who sustain traumaticinjuries. Patients who require subspecialty carenot available at your institution should be con-sidered for transfer. The transfer process shouldbe started as soon as a need for transfer is identi- fied. Most trauma centers prefer to receive thepatient earlier in the course of care, following ini-tial stabilization with less evaluation, rather thanlater. All life-threatening injuries should be eval-uated and addressed prior to transfer. Trauma patients with evidence of airway, breathing, or circulatory compromise require theconsultation of a trauma surgeon. This should bedone while providing necessary stabilization andappropriate treatment. Waiting on the arrival ofthe surgeon before performing life-saving proce-dures should not occur.Institutions have specific criteria to notify the trauma or surgical service of a trauma patient'sarrival. Familiarity with an institution's criteriais extremely important to patient care. Often emer-gency physicians perform the primary and sec- ondary surveys prior to the arrival of a traumasurgeon or team, with consultation directed bythe injuries identified. Most of the time, however,a trauma surgeon will be involved in the initialevaluation of the trauma patient, and will assistwith admission and disposition decisions afterthe initial resuscitation. Emergency physicianshave the primary responsibility for traumapatients while they remain in the ED. Disposition options for each trauma patient include discharge to home, admission to an obser-vation unit, ward or intensive care unit (ICU), a trip to the OR, or transfer to another facility.Admission decisions should not be delayed untilcompletion of an exhaustive evaluation. Rather,disposition options should be considered earlyand repeatedly throughout the evaluation. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Remember the ABCs. Always start withairway, followed by breathing, circulation,and disability. Exposure is important during the evaluation. Attention should not be drawn to grotesque injuries, whichmay result in missing life-threatening ones. If things start to deteriorate, return to the ABCs. Be suspicious of injuries based on themechanism of injury. Maintain a high level of suspicion for injuries even if the patientlooks well initially. The examination of thetrauma patient should be thorough andsystematic. Be quick but thorough. Managing theresuscitation of the trauma patient in the first (golden) hour often determines the patient'soutcome. Being idle or not attending to detailcan prove devastating. W ork collaboratively with your trauma consultants. Clearly established roles for physicians involved in traumaresuscitation result in the best care, and benefit everyone. Keep all trauma patients warm. Exposureand IV fluids can cause hypothermia, whichmay lead to coagulopathy and worseningprognosis.

Traumatic injuries 116 Principles of Emergency MedicinePrinciples of Emergency Medicine 117Prehospital care and emergency medical services History of emergency medical services Over the past four decades, prehospital care and emergency medical services (EMS) in the UShave evolved rapidly from near nonexistenceinto key links in the chain of survival for patientswith acute injury or illness. Beginning in themid-1960s, after a landmark report titled Acci- dental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease ofModern Society detailed serious deficiencies in out-of-hospital trauma management, state andfederal lawmakers began to enact new standardsfor training, equipment, and oversight in EMSsystems. The resulting translation into the fieldof formerly hospital-limited therapies for lifethreats, such as the unstable airway, respiratoryfailure, hemodynamic collapse, and dysrhythmias,in addition to traumatic injuries, has resulted incountless numbers of lives saved. With furtheradvances in research, technology, and education,today's prehospital care providers are continu-ally becoming more sophisticated in the diagno-sis and treatment of acute injury and illness.Understanding the structure and capabilities ofEMS is a critical component of emergency med-icine, as the collaboration between prehospitaland hospital-based providers determines thequality of emergency medical care delivered tothe community. Prehospital systems Each municipality or rural area has severaloptions with regard to the administration of theirEMS. When government-run, EMS can be admin-istered either as a stand-alone agency or underthe command of the fire department. Alterna-tively, prehospital care can be provided by a localhospital or private ambulance company under contract to the city or county. In rural areas, EMScan be provided by volunteers on call fromhome. Regional coordination of EMS care, espe-cially at the Advanced Life Support (ALS) level,can optimize response times and maximize sys-tem resource utilization. The ideal structure of anemergency medical system is frequently debated,but must vary depending on the setting. The keyfactors that influence the choice of systeminclude population size and density, municipalbudget, and political concerns. Air medical sys-tems are typically administered by a hospital (orhospital consortium) or state agency to providecare for a large geographic region. EMS personnel and qualifications There are generally three broad categories of EMS personnel: first responders, basic emergency medi-cal technicians (EMTs) (also known as EMT-basicor EMT-B), and paramedics (or EMT-P). First responders are trained in basic first aid measures such as bandaging, splinting, hemor-rhage control, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Generally, these are police, firefighters,and other volunteers who may be the first toarrive at an accident scene. First responders usu-ally do not transport patients. EMT-Bs are trained to assess signs and symp- toms, safely extricate, immobilize, and trans port the patient, and administer certain non-invasivetherapies such as oxygen. Though not trained incardiac rhythm interpretation, many EMTs candefibrillate through the use of automatic externaldefibrillators (AEDs). Care EMT-Bs is termedbasic life support (BLS). Most EMT-B coursesconsist of approximately 120 to 160 hours of clin- ical instruction and several hours of observation in emergency departments and obstetric units.The EMT-intermediate (EMT-I) is an extension of the EMT-B with additional train ing to obtain intravenous (IV) access, administer IV fluids,and use airway adjuncts such as the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or pharyngotracheal lumenairway (PTLA). The EMT-I generally does notadminister medications. Many systems thatemploy EMT-Is are in rural areas that cannotafford or recruit full paramedic coverage. EMT-Ps are trained in advanced airway man- agement, including endotracheal car-diac rhythm interpretation and defibrillation,and medication administration. Add-itionally, many paramedics are trained in cricothy-rotomy and needle chest decompression when7Prehospital care and emergency medical services Paul D. Biddinger, MDand Stephen H. Thomas, MDPrehospital care and emergency medical services 118 Principles of Emergency Medicinestate and regional protocols allow. Prehospital care by paramedics is termed ALS. Paramedictraining programs consist of at least 500 hours of classroom instruction as well as mandatorysupervised hospital and field internships. With increasing regionalization of specialized medical and surgical services, critical care trans-port (either by air or ground) is increasingly rec-ognized as a unique area of expertise. Manystates now allow for paramedics with specializedadditional training and supervision to function ata level beyond standard protocols. Additionalpersonnel beyond the EMT-Ps are also frequentlyused both in air and ground-based critical caretransport. Physicians are standard members ofthe air medical crew in most non-US settings, butin the US, non-physicians staff over 90% of mostcrews. One exception to this rule in the US iswhere emergency medicine residencies providephysician coverage. Nurses staffing critical caretransport units generally have experience in bothemergency and critical care settings, with addi-tional experience (pediatric or obstetric) depend-ing on the characteristics of the program's patientpopulation. Other crewmembers, such as neo-natal nurse practitioners or balloon pump special-ists, may be used depending on local preferences and specific patient needs. At this time, consistentnational standards for critical care transport donot exist, but at least one non-governmentalaccreditation agency (the Commission on Accredit-ation of Medical Transport Systems) has recog- nized that the level of care, rather than thetransport vehicle, should be a prime focus for theevaluation of critical care transport services. EMS response 911 system Approximately 96% of the US population cur- rently have access to emergency care via the 911- telephone system. Enhanced 911 systems usecomputer databases to display the address of thecaller, activating the 911 system in the event thecaller is unable to speak. Although many mobilephones cannot be precisely located, there areemerging technologies that may help dispatchersapproximate the location of a cellular phone.Global Positioning System (GPS) software is nowavailable in mobile phones so that callers may belocated if they are lost or unable to speak. ManyEMS systems train their dispatchers to follow acareful script of questions when they are calledfor help in a medical emergency. The answers tothese questions determine the priority of the calland allow for the nearest available ambulance tobe dispatched to the patient with the highest pri-ority complaint. Arrival on scene The first priority of rescuers in any emergency is to ensure scene safety. Rescuers have a duty tothemselves and the people they have been sent toassist. They should be able to care for and trans-port patients and not become patients them-selves. Violent crimes often occur in scenes thatremain unsafe after the initial injury. Despite the usual temptation to aid the victim as soon as pos-sible, rescuers must not enter a violent crimescene until the police or detectives have firstsecured it. Rescuers are also at risk on the scene ofmotor vehicle collisions. When approaching anaccident, the rescuers must survey the scene forpotential hazards such as passing traffic, haz-ardous materials, or electrical wires. In accidentsinvolving hazardous materials, rescuers mustposition themselves at a safe distance uphill andupwind, and the materials should be identifiedbefore personnel enter the scene. Specializedteams may need to be activated before the patientmay be reached. In all cases, victims and EMSproviders must be adequately decontaminatedbefore arrival at the hospital to avoid furtherspread of toxins to other patients and health careproviders. Certain other circumstances requiremobilization of additional r esources before the patient may be safely reached. These include waterrescue, trench and confined space rescue, and high-angle (high-elevation) rescue. These situa-tions may be beyond the training of local authori-ties, and additional personnel and resources may need to be summoned from larger communityunits in the state or surrounding area. Extrication Extrication is the technique of safely removing the patient from his or her environment andreaching the transport vehicle. This may be espe- cially difficult with tight spaces, obese patients,rough terrain, and trauma. Extrication in trauma may involve displacing debris that entraps thepatient. Since significant force using hydraulic orair pressure often must be employed to manipu-late the debris, carefully trained rescuers are crit-ical to minimize the risk of further injury to thePrinciples of Emergency Medicine 119Prehospital care and emergency medical servicespatient either from the debris or from unneces- sary movement. While certain therapies such asoxygen administration, IV therapy, parenteralanalgesia, needle decompression of the thorax,and occasionally definitive airway managementmay be started before the patient is free of theentrapment, delay in transport to a hospital whileextrication occurs is generally associated withworse outcome. Prolonged extrication time (morethan 20 minutes) is considered a marker for poten-tially severe injury, and warrants triage directlyto a trauma center when possible. Clinical capabilities of EMS Airway management There are multiple devices designed to assist in the prehospital management of the patient's airwayand breathing. Rescuers at all levels are trainedin the use of the bag-valve-mask (BVM) deviceand both the nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) and oropharyngeal airway (OPA). The NPA and OPAare curved pieces of plastic that are insertedblindly, provided there are no contraindications.They are used chiefly to maintain airway patency. Rescuers either not trained in endotracheal intubation or unable to achieve tracheal intuba-tion with direct laryngoscopy may use the PTLA(Figure 7.1) or Combitube (Figure 7.2) for a patientwith airway compromise. The PTLA and Com-bitube are similar devices (with multiple tubesbound together) designed for blind insertion intothe patient's airway. Their success depends onthe operator being able to correctly identifywhich of the blindly-inserted tubes ends up inthe esophagus, and which tube can adequatelyventilate the trachea. The LMA (Figure 7.3) wasfirst introduced in the operative setting in thelate 1980s as an alternative to endotracheal intub-ation for selected patients, but has increasinglybeen used as an alternative when endotrachealintubation cannot be achieved. The device con-sists of an inflatable V-shaped diaphragm at theend of a large-bore tube that is placed blindlyinto the larynx. It is relatively easy to use andminimizes the risk of gastric insufflation duringassisted ventilation. It does not, however, protectthe trachea from aspiration of blood or vomitus. Endotracheal intubation (ETI) remains the gold standard for airway protection, though thistechnique is most dependent on operator skill andpatient factors. Many factors common in prehos-pital care can make oral ETI difficult or impos-sible: operator's inexperience, inadequate patientsedation or relaxation, blood or vomitus in theairway, and anatomic variables such as an anteriorlarynx or expanding neck hematoma. Outside ofinvestigational protocols, oral ETI is attemptedin the prehospital setting only by rescuers withparamedic training or above.

(b) (a) (c)who still have spontaneous respiratory effort but need definitive airway control. This technique isof greatest use when orotracheal intubation iseither not possible or very unlikely to succeed dueto anatomic or traumatic reasons. The BNTI tech-nique, uncommonly utilized at receiving traumacenters, is employed more frequently in the pre-hospital setting when neuromuscular blockade isnot available, and jaw clenching prevents oral intu-bation. BNTI is contraindicated in patients with significant facial trauma. While neuromuscular- blocking agents (paralytics) are an integral com-ponent of rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in the hospital, historical concerns exist about theiruse by prehospital personnel. These providersmay only infrequently intubate and, if unable to intubate or ventilate a previously spontaneously- breathing patient, have severely limited access torescue techniques. Many helicopter transport ser- vices have reported high rates of successful intub-ations ( /H1102296%) using paralytics, but in general they employ a very select and experienced groupof practitioners. Some ground transport serviceshave also reported high success rates ( /H1102294%) using paralytics, but most frequently this is inhigh-volume urban areas under very close medicaldirection. At the current time, the use of para lytics (and concomitant induction agents) to facilitateintubation should only be allowed in systems with highly-trained and experienced providersoperating under tight medical control; sufficientbackup and rescue techniques must be availablein the event of failed ETI. Approximately 70% of US ground paramedics and all air medical paramedics are allowed toperform some form of surgical airway access ifneeded. Skills range from needle cricothyrotomywith jet ventilation, to the use of percutaneouskits that employ the Seldinger technique (such asthe Melker kit), to open cricothyrotomy. The needfor cricothyrotomy in the field is fortunatelyinfrequent. Surprisingly, given the lack of experi-ence, reported success rates in the field are high(82-100%). All systems employing the use of par-alytics must equip and train their providers toperform a surgical airway in the event of failedintubation and ventilation. Intravenous access and fluid administration Paramedics and EMT-Is should attempt IV access on all unstable or potentially unstable patients inthe field. Many life-saving medications are mosteffective, or only available, when administered IV .Furthermore, IV crystalloid infusion remains thecornerstone of management of hypotension in thefield. When possible, every trauma patient shouldhave two large-bore (e.g., 14- or 16-gauge) IVcatheters placed in the field. However, attempts at cannulation have been reported to add as muchas 12 minutes to on-scene times. Rescuers must notdelay transport when adequate access has notbeen obtained. For most patients, the appropriaterule of thumb is two attempts per provider, ideally during transport of the patient. In 1994, a prom-inent Houston study reported that aggressive pre-hospital fluid resuscitation of hypotensive victimsof penetrating trauma did not improve survivaland actually increased total blood loss when com-pared with delayed resuscitation in the hospital.The results of this study and its applicability to other settings are still debated. However, thisremains an area of ongoing research interest, so prehospital pr oviders and physicians developing EMS proto cols should be cognizant of the need to avoid over-r esuscitation (with concomitant risk of increased hemorrhage) and under-resuscitation (with attendant risk of hypoperfusion). Transport time and time to defini tive control of suspected hemorrhage are important factors to considerwhen choosing to begin prehospital fluid resusci-tation. Not all parameters will consistently beimproved by fluid administration (e.g., alteredmental status in the head-injured patient), and providers must exercise judgment as to the ade-quacy and appropriateness of their resuscitation. Cardiac monitoring and defibrillation Early defibrillation is critically important for patients with non-perfusing ventricular tachycar- dia or ventricular fibrillation, since survival forthese patients decreases by 10% per minute. Withthe advent of AEDs, most first responders andEMT-Bs who arrive on scene before paramedicscan now defibrillate pulseless patients in ventricu-lar fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. How-ever, rhythm interpretation and the decision tocardiovert borderline perfusing rhythms remainsolely within the scope of ALS. Many paramedicsare now trained to perform and interpret 12-leadelectrocardiograms (ECG); some have the capabil-ity of radio transmission of the ECG to the hospital.Multiple studies have demonstrated that well-trained paramedics have excellent accuracy forboth rhythm recognition and detection of ST-segment elevation in acute coronary syndromes.Such skills are critical for proper application of the American Heart As sociation's Advanced Cardiovascular L ife Support (ACLS) guidelines. Medication administration Although certain states allow EMT-Bs to admin- ister one or two selected life-saving medicationssuch as glucose, epinephrine, or albuterol, mostBLS providers cannot administer medications. Ingeneral, only paramedics may administer medica-tions. Paramedics are equipped with medicinesto treat pain, selected overdoses, hypoglycemia,bronchospasm, allergic reactions, hypotension andcardiac ischemia, and ALS systems may carry paralytic agentsto facilitate intubation at the discretion of the stateand local medical directors. Field medication use,especially with controlled substances and withpotentially pro-arrhythmic agents, must be tightlymonitored and subject to regular quality assuranceby the medical director. Needle decompression Most paramedics are permitted to perform chest decompression in the patient with suspected ten-sion pneumothorax. Signs hyper-resonant breath sounds,jugular venous distention, and deviation of the Principles of Emergency Medicine 121Prehospital care and emergency medical servicestrachea away from the affected side. Needle decompression is indicated for a patient in severe distress with the above signs or in cardiac arrestfollowing trauma. Immobilization All EMS personnel are trained in the proper tech- nique for spinal immobilization of patients(Figure 7.4). An appropriately-sized, rigid cer-vical collar should be placed on every victim oftrauma with potential for spinal injury, including patients with pain, tenderness, or a suspicious mechanism of injury. However, since the cervicalcollar alone does not provide adequate immobil-ization for transport, patients should also be sta-bilized with a rigid backboard and some form of lateral stabilization (such as foam blocks) securedwith straps or tape. Special steps, such as the useof a towel roll under the shoulders, may need tobe taken to maximize head position (i.e., preventflexion) in pediatric patients. Pregnant patientsshould have the right side of the backboard ele-vated 30\u00b0 to keep the uter us off the inferior vena cava. This is done to avoid hypotension and fetalhypoperfusion. Patients with gunshot wounds tothe neck, thorax, or abdomen not meeting the crite-ria above are not at increased risk for occult spinalinjury and therefore do not need full immobiliza-tion on a backboard. Placement of a patient on abackboard is not innocuous; studies have shownthat pressure-mediated skin damage can begin todevelop after as little as 30 minutes on a backboard. The Kendrick extrication device (KED) is made up of a series of parallel splints longitudinallybound together in a vest-like device that providesassistance with spinal stabilization during theextrication of a trauma patient from an enclosedspace, such as a motor vehicle. It does not providefull spinal immobilization, and therefore cannotbe used in lieu of a backboard for adults. Due toits wrap-around nature, however, it may be use-ful for pediatric patients who cannot or will notlie still on a standard backboard. Patients with unstable vital signs should have only the injured extremities immobilized whichhave the potential to cause further hemorrhage ifmoved (i.e., pelvis and long bones, especially suspected femur fractures). Angulated extremityfractures should be carefully evaluated for distalneurovascular status. Currently, most prehospitaljurisdictions call for traction splinting of suspectedfemur fractures, but this is subject to debate. Thesedevices require time for application, are of debat-able benefit in the field, and have contraindications(e.g., pelvic fracture) which may be unapparent.Any patient with an angulated fracture of anyextremity with absent distal pulses should have in-line traction applied and be splinted. All othersuspected fractures should be immobilized in theposition of greatest comfort for transport. Pneumatic anti-shock garment/military anti-shock trousers Developed during the Vietnam War to treat sol- diers exsanguinating in the field, the pneumaticanti-shock garment (PASG) was a mainstay ofprehospital trauma care for nearly 20 years until itsuse was called into question by two outcome stud-iesin the 1990s. Formerly known as the military anti-shock trousers (MAST), this device consistsof a set of nylon pants with separately inflatableleg and abdominal sections that attach to a manualpump with a pressure gauge. Currently, the litera-ture does not support the use of the PASG in pen-etrating trauma. There is some reason to believethat the PASG may be a useful immobilizationdevice for pelvic fractures and/or femur fractures.Use in blunt trauma patients with severe hypoten-sion is still debated, but it is used in some regionsfor this indication. The PASG is contraindicated inpatients who are pregnant or who edema, evisceration of abdominal organs,cardiac tamponade, or cardiogenic shock. Wound care All EMS providers are trained to control external hemorrhage with direct pressure and elevationof the injury above the heart. Bandages that Prehospital care and emergency medical services 122 Principles of Emergency Medicine Figure 7.4 Spinal immobilization. Courtesy :S.V. Mahadevan, MD.become soaked with blood are not removed, but rather reinforced with further gauze. Tourniquetsare only placed in cases of life-threatening limbhemorrhage that cannot be controlled with con-tinuous direct pressure, elevation, and banda-ging. If tourniquets are applied in the field, theyshould not be removed by EMS providers. Pediatrics Although EMS personnel at all levels are trained to evaluate, treat, and transport pediatric patients,many prehospital providers are uncomfortablewhen caring for acutely ill children. Such patientsare relatively rare, and most cases evoke muchmore than the usual stress for those involved. Ingeneral, the most significant differences betweenacutely ill adult and pediatric patients are: 1.vital sign abnormalities indicating significant injury or illness may be delayed comparedwith adult patients; 2.the age-specific nature of normal pediatricvital signs may lead practitioners tomisinterpret absolute vital signs; 3.procedures, including IV access andintubation, are technically more challengingin children; and 4.children may be unable to give adequatehistories or cooperate with procedures suchas immobilization, and may requireadditional restraint for safe transport. Recent data demonstrate that well-trained para-medics can deliver high-quality care to both adultand pediatric patients in nearly all arenas, butsuch care requires intensive education and regu-lar review of skills. One very important exceptionto this rule is that pediatric patients should rarelybe intubated in the field, even in cases of respira-tory failure. Published data show that, in contrastwith adults, morbidity and mortality are increasedwhen prehospital care providers attempt to intub-ateapneic or hypoventilating pediatric patients. In general, prehospital pediatric intubation shouldonly be attempted when effective BVM ventila-tion cannot be achieved. Mass casualty incidents/disaster Amass casualty incident (MCI) is any event that produces multiple casualties (injuries or illness). Adisaster is any event that overwhelms the capa- bilities of the local emergency response systemand facilities. Although the two concepts are dif-ferent, the principles of triage and care oftenoverlap. Rescuers must be able to perform a brief(less than 60 seconds) evaluation of each patientin an MCI, focusing on ventilation, perfusion, andmental status, and triage each patient accordingto severity of injury. In large mass casualty inci-dents, a color-coded tag is attached to each victimto aid in efficient triage and transport. A sample medical emergency triage tag (METT AG) system is shown in Figure 7.5 and Table 7.1. Incident command Incident command is the system used for overall management of the disaster event, and is gener-ally the responsibility of the ranking fire serviceofficer on scene. EMS officials and occasionally anon-site physician experienced in disaster manage-ment are responsible for coordinating the medicalactivities and care with the incident commander. Community-wide disaster systems Planning and preparation prior to a disaster and/ or MCI is critical for a successful response.Preparation should include plans for fieldresponse, hazardous materials, staging and trans- portation, documentation of available local hos- pital resources, communication plans and backupsystems, documentation, and debriefing andcounseling after the events and recovery. Regularpractice and drills are vital to train rescuers andtest the system. Medical direction All care delivered by EMS personnel is providedunder protocols and authority given to them by aphysician medical director. The responsibility aphysician assumes for the care delivered in anEMS system is called medical direction or med-ical control. Most of the real-time medical caredelivered by prehospital providers is done following prewritten standing orders (\"off-line\"medical control). This does not require directcommunication with a physician during thepatient encounter. In these cases, patient care is reviewed retrospectively through standard processes, known as continuous quality improve- ment (CQI). This \"off-line\" component of educa-tion, training, and continuing care review is the largest and the most important part of medicaldirection in EMS. In certain instances, however, Principles of Emergency Medicine 123Prehospital care and emergency medical servicesPrehospital care and emergency medical services 124 Principles of Emergency Medicine (a) (b) Figure 7.5 METTAG: Medical Emergency Field Triage Tag. A suggested approach to treatment prioritization of victims is that found in the medical emergency triage tag system.The treatment priorities are defined as: Zero priority (black): Deceased or live patients with obvious fatal and non-resuscitatable injuries. First priority (red): Severely injured patients requiring immediate care and transport (e.g., respiratory distress, thoracoabdominal injury, severe head or maxillofacial injuries, shock orsevere bleeding, severe burns). Second priority (yellow): Patients with injuries that are determined not to be immediately life-threatening (e.g., abdominal injury without shock, thoracic injury without respiratory compromise, major fractures without shock, head injury/cervical spine injury, and minor burns). Third priority (green): Patients with minor injuries that do not require immediate stabilization (e.g., soft tissue injuries, extremity fractures and dislocations, maxillofacial injuries without airway compromise, and psychological emergencies).Table 7.1 Medical emergency triage tag system of field triage in a mass casuality incidentsuch as the administration of IV opiates in some jurisdic tions, paramedics must contact a physician directly by radio or phone for \"on-line\" medical control. In those cases, the orders given by thephysician must still conform to the state proto-cols and not exceed the paramedic's scope of prac- tice. Rescuers may also use the on-line system to obtain a \"field-consultation\" from a physicianwhen necessary, as in cases of a patient's refusalof transport or for other questions. Patient transport Vehicles Standard ambulances come in various types,characterized by different vehicle designs. Type Iambulances are conventional box-type vehicleswhich lack a passageway between the driver andpatient care compartments. Type II vehicles arevan-type trucks. Type III vehicles are larger unitswith a forward cab and a walk-through passage-way to the patient care area. Some units mayrequire special equipment in order to provide electrical power to medical devices. Many types of helicopters are used for patient transport. Depending on the resources and needsof a particular region, helicopters of particularsizes, speeds, costs, and physical characteristicsmay be chosen. Most helicopters in use in the USare twin-engine models, which have improvedsafety margins due to the redundancy affordedby the extra engine. Helicopter transports usu-ally involve one patient only. For less acutepatients, two-patient transports can be performed(if the helicopter allows). There is great variationbetween helicopter models with respect to sizeand speed; slower aircraft travel at little over100-110 meters per hour, whereas other helicop-ters cruise nearly twice as fast. Fixed-wing aircraft (airplanes) vary just as helicopters do, with a myriad of propeller- andjet-powered vehicles in use. In general, jet air-craft provide a smoother ride, faster speed, andare more likely to be able to pressurize to sea level,especially when flying at higher altitudes. Due tothe relative isolation of patient care in a fixed-wing aircraft, patients should be reasonably sta-ble before fixed-wing transport is undertaken. Emergency warning devices While the use of warning lights and siren (L&S) is standard among emergency vehicles, it is notwithout risk and controversy. Each year, rescuers,patients, and bystanders are injured or killed incollisions during the use of L&S. In general,when operating with L&S, rescuers must exer-cise \"due for other vehicles; in all cases,the use of L&S must be based upon standardizedprotocols that account for the severity of thecomplaint or the acuity of illness. Patient transfer It is not uncommon for IV catheters or endotra- cheal tubes (ETTs) to become dislodged duringpatient transport. Every possible precautionshould be taken to secure medical access devicesfollowing their placement, and transfer patientsslowly and deliberately. Optimally, one prehos-pital provider should have as his or her soleresponsibility the assurance of maintaining ETT position during patient transfers. Additionally,re-confirmation of ETT position is warranted each time an intubated patient is moved fromone surface to another. Communication Communication between prehospital providers and hospital personnel most commonly occursvia simplex (one-way) radio systems using eitherultra high frequency (UHF) or very high fre-quency (VHF). Advancing technology is increas-ingly allowing EMS providers to receive dispatchand scene information by computer and conversewith dispatch or hospital personnel in a duplex(two-way) fashion, either with paired radio fre-quencies or cellular phones. Whenever possible,prehospital personnel should have backup sys-tems to their primary means of communication. Destination criteria Severely injured victims of trauma should be transported directly to a designated Level I or IItrauma center, bypassing smaller hospitals whentransport times are not excessive. One studyrevealed that patients who must be transferred secondarily from a local hospital to a trauma cen-ter had a 30% increased risk of mortality com-pared with those who were transported directlyto the trauma center from the scene. Furthermore,for similarly injured patients, the risk of dying ina Level I trauma center was 54% lower than inLevel II centers and 75% lower than in hospitalsthat are not trauma centers. Rescuers should fol-low state protocols regarding indications for Principles of Emergency Medicine 125Prehospital care and emergency medical servicestransport directly to a trauma center, but most protocols are similar to the American College ofSurgeon's Field Triage Algorithm (Table 7.2). Thepatient in cardiac arrest should be transporteddirectly to the nearest available emergency depart-ment, even in cases of trauma. Victims of trauma who arrest in the field have a dismal prognosisbut warrant the immediate application of hospi-tal resources to treat potentially reversible causesof death. As with victims of major trauma, significantly burned patients meeting appropriate triage cri-teria should be transported directly to a desig-nated burn center when feasible (Table 7.3). Currently, nationally-recognized point-of- entry (POE) criteria, which allow EMS personnelto bypass a nearby hospital for one farther awaywith specialty services, only exist for the trans-port of patients with severe trauma or burns. Expanded POE criteria are being instituted in sev-eral communities for selected disease processes,such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) oracute stroke, but are not yet the standard of care. Special considerations in air transport The decision of when a helicopter should respond to the scene of injury or illness remains an inexactscience. The best sources acknowledge that thejudgment of the prehospital personnel at thescene is of primary importance, but the decisionto use helicopter transport can be bolstered bycriteria listed below and in Table 7.4: 1.Mechanism of injury 2.Physiologic variables 3.Anatomic variables 4.Time and logistics. Space constraints are the major issue in provid- ing care in any aircraft. Both the actual space (cubic feet) and the arrangement of the space (cabin configuration) can have profound effects on theability of the air medical crew to perform inter-ventions such as intubation. This translates intothe need for the air medical crew to sometimesadjust the care provided accordingly. One exam-ple would be intubating patients prior to flight ifthere is a significant chance of airway deteriora-tion while en route. Crewmembers should becross-trained to allow either crewmember to pro-vide indicated medical interventions duringflight. Some interventions, such as provision ofchest compressions, are extremely difficult to pro-vide effectively in the air medical setting. Noise is of a sufficient degree to preclude reli- able auscultation and monitoring of aural alarms(e.g., on a ventilator). The flight crew must learnto use other means of patient assessment andequipment monitoring. Vibration is a theoretical problem for the patient, and high-frequency vibrations have been shownto induce fatigue in caregivers. In general, how-ever, the ride in a helicopter or fixed-wing air-craft can often be much smoother than a ride in aground ambulance. Lighting in an aircraft, and to a lesser extent in a ground ambulance, differs from that which isnormally available in a well-lit hospital resusci-tation area. Some helicopters, for instance, havepatient care cabins which are contiguous with(and not separated from) the pilot seat; in suchsituations the medical crew must work in red,blue, and/or dimmed lighting at night. Altitude issues relate to hypoxemia, pressure- volume changes, temperature, and humidity.Altitude-related hypoxemia is not usually anissue due to the fact that patients receive oxygentherapy and the altitude is usually not sufficientlyhigh for the crew to require supplemental oxy-gen. Exceptions to this general rule occur, how-ever, with both patients (e.g .,premature neonates with narrow therapeutic windows for oxygenadministration) and crew (e.g .,crew in programs based at higher altitudes, who wear oxygenmasks for prevention of hypoxemic symptoms).Boyle's law describes the inverse relationshipbetween ambient pressure and gas volume. Thisis a factor with respect to both equipment (e.g.,ventilator, intra-aortic balloon pump, Minnesotatubes for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage tam-ponade) and patients (e.g., need for pre-flightplacement of a gastric tube to prevent vomiting inunconscious patients). High altitude is associatedwith decreased ambient temperature. Especiallyin colder climates where the patient may behypothermic before being loaded onto the air-craft, and in aircraft with suboptimal heating systems, hypothermia is a risk of helicopter trans-port. Higher altitude and lower temperature areassociated with decreased humidity. This canresult in hardening of secretions, such as in the ETT, which the air medical crew should monitor(and suction) as indicated. Helicopters generallytransport patients at altitudes of 500-2000 feetabove ground level. Therefore, unless transportsoccur at geographic locations where ground levelis significantly elevated, altitude issues are of Prehospital care and emergency medical services 126 Principles of Emergency MedicinePrinciples of Emergency Medicine 127Prehospital care and emergency medical services Measure Vital Signs and Level of Consciousness STEP 1 Yes No\u007f GCS /H11021 14 or \u007f Systolic \u007f RTS 11 or \u007f PTS /H11021 9 STEP 2 \u007f Flail chest \u007f proximal long-bone fractures\u007f Amputation proximal to wrist/ankle \u007f All penetrating trauma to head, neck, torso, and extremities proximal to elbow and knee\u007f Limb paralysis\u007f Pelvic fractures\u007f Combination trauma with burns STEP 3 STEP 4\u007f Ejection from auto \u007f Death in same passenger compartment \u007f Pedestrian thrown or run over \u007f High-speed auto crash \u007f Initial speed /H1102240 mph (64 \u007f Major auto deformity /H1102220 inches (50 cm) \u007f Intrusion into passenger compartment /H1102212 inches (30 cm)\u007f Extrication time /H1102220 minutes Roll Auto-pedestrian injury with /H110225 mph (8 kph) impact \u007f Motorcycle crash /H1102220 mph (32 kph) or with separation of rider and bikeTake to trauma center;alert trauma teamAssess anatomy of injuryFLOWCHART 1 TRIAGE DECISION SCHEME Yes No Take to trauma center;alert trauma team Evaluate for mechanismof injury and evidence of high-energy impact Yes No Contact medical control; consider transport to trauma center; considertrauma team alert Reevaluate with medical control When in Doubt, Take to a Trauma Center!Contact medical control; consider transport to trauma center; consider trauma team alertYes BP: blood rate; RTS: revised trauma score.Prehospital care and emergency medical services 128 Principles of Emergency MedicineTable 7.4 National Association of Emergency Medical Service Physicians guidelines for dispatching a helicopter to an emergency scene1.Partial thickness burns /H1102210% (total body surface area) 2.Burns that involve the face, hands, feet, genitalia, perineum, or major joints 3.Third-degree burns in any age group 4.Electrical burns, including lightning injury 5.Chemical burns 6.Inhalation injury 7.Burn injury in patients with pre-existing medical disorders that could complicate management, prolong recovery, or affect mortality.

On the other hand, fixed-wing transports occur at much higher altitudes, whichbrings into play issues of cabin pressurization andrisks of sudden decompression. Safety is the paramount consideration for any air transport service. At any time, in any mission,the pilot or medical crew should be empowered tohalt the transport if safety considerations becomea concern. Direct comparison between air andground vehicle safety is difficult, since crashesinvolving medical helicopters (or less commonly,fixed-wing aircraft) are more reliably tracked andmore widely publicized than crashes of groundvehicles. Sometimes, considerable judgment mustbe exercised in determining whether to perform acritical procedure (e.g., intubation) before or aftertransport commences. Except in cases where afixed-wing aircraft is used solely because criticalpatients cannot be evacuated by air (e.g., fog pre-cludes helicopter operations but a fixed-wing air-craft can safely operate in a remote area), patientstransported by airplane typically have lesser acu-ity and greater stability than those transported byground.

Principles of Emergency Medicine 129Prehospital care and emergency medical servicesPrinciples of Emergency Medicine 131Pain management Scope of the problem Acute pain is the most common complaint of patients presenting to the emergency department(ED), comprising 60% of presenting complaintsin one study. Recognition and acknowledgmentof a patient's pain, adequate treatment, and timelyreassessment are essential to acute pain manage- ment in the ED. Unfortunately, it has been demon-strated that many physicians fail to treat pain promptly or adequately in both inpatient andoutpatient settings. Pain Pain is whatever the experiencing person says itis, existing whenever he or she says it does. TheInternational Association for the Study of Paindefines pain as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual orpotential tissue damage, or described in terms ofsuch damage,\" \"always subjective,\" and \"learnedthrough experiences related to injury in earlylife.\" Pain includes behavioral and physical indi-cators, in addition to self-report. Thus, preverbal,nonverbal, or cognitively-impaired individualswho experience pain can benefit from objectivepain assessment. Fear and anxiety increase theperception of physical pain - the unfamiliar andfrequently unfriendly ED environment does littleto ameliorate a patient's pain. Acute pain is a symptom of injury or illness, which serves the biologic purpose of warning anindividual of a problem and limiting activitiesthat might exacerbate it. Acute pain is usuallyassociated with identifiable pathology and causesanxiety. By convention, it is present for less than 6 months. Chronic, malignant pain is associated with a terminal disease, such as cancer or acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Thesepatients are usually under the care of a multidis-ciplinary team that directs their analgesia regimenand comfort care. Chronic, nonmalignant pain is a complex prob- lem, defined as pain being present for greater than 6 months. In general, it is not associated with areadily treatable, or sometimes even identifiable,cause. It is generally associated with depressionrather than anxiety. Patients may have a well-defined cause (e.g., tic douloureux) or no object-ively confirmed cause (e.g., reflex sympatheticdystrophy). These patients frequently arouse ani-mosity amongst ED staff because they can be quitedemanding, and at times manipulative. The staffoften senses that acute interventions will generallyfail to help these patients for any length of time. There are patients who feign pain to acquire opioids, either for their own use or to sell on thestreets. These individuals may be difficult to dis-tinguish from the group previously defined. Analgesia Analgesia is the \"loss of sensitivity to pain.\" Inthe ED, this means the reduction of pain throughtherapy. The therapy is not solely pharmacologicin nature - psychologic and social support, aswell as physical positioning for maximum com-fort help reduce perceived pain. These interven-tions reassure the patient that the provider isaware of his or her pain and is making attemptsto relieve it. Child life therapists, when available,provide psychologic support to children as wellas distraction from painful procedures, such asstarting an intravenous (IV) line. Oligoanalgesia Inadequately or poorly treated acute pain mayresult in negative physiologic outcomes. Poorly treated acute pain may exacerbate the under-lying pathophysiology of many illnesses andinjuries, and may result in the development ofchronic pain. The failure of physicians to treat pain has been documented in the ED as well as in the inpatientsetting. Children receive fewer doses of analgesia,in general, and opiates, in particular, than adultswith equivalent diagnoses or undergoing equallypainful procedures. Wilson and Pendleton reported in 1989 that in one aca demic ED, 56% of patients presenting with painful conditions received no analgesics. Further-more,only 14% received any analgesia within the first hour of their ED stay. In this study,8P ain management Eustacia (Jo) Su, MDPain management 132 Principles of Emergency Medicinemeperidine was the medication used most com- monly. Findings included inadequate doses 55%of the time, and 60% of agents were given by intra-muscular (IM) injection, despite the known dis- advantages of this route of administration. In this study, only 31% of patients with an acute myocar-dial infarction and persistent chest pain receivedIV opioids. Lewis and Sasater studied eight EDsand found that only 30% of patients with acutefractures received opioids while in the ED. Assessment and measurement of pain Goals and challenges It is imperative for physicians to detect and meas- ure pain rapidly so that they can institute prompttreatment and assess its effect. Even though apatient may not appear to be in pain, he or she mayactually be in severe pain. Careful listening, obser-vation, and repeated solicitation may be necessaryto fully elicit an admission of pain. Assessmentmust be both qualitative (is pain present?) andquantitative (how much does it hurt?). \"Has thepain improved following treatment?\" is an import-ant reassessment question. Early reassessmentmust follow the initial treatment to ensure its adequacy and that repeated medication doses aregiven promptly to prevent pain recurrence. There are no reliable objective or physiologic signs of pain. Normal vital signs may persistdespite severe pain. Medication, a personal orcultural tendency to stoicism, or adaptive mech-anisms, such as joking, may mask the presentationof pain. Language and cultural barriers also inter- fere with the patient's ability to communicate hisor her pain to the physician and health care team.Preverbal children, especially toddlers, may onlybe able to express an \"owie.\" Neonates and younginfants cannot verbalize at all; interpreting theircries requires time, ex perience, and motivation to understand and treat their pain. Self-report assessment The most reliable approach to assessing pain severity is patient self-report. Self-report tools arethe mainstay of pain management research, butrequire that patients have cognitive and commu- nication skills. The ideal self-report tool should beeasy to use and applicable across language, cul-tural, age, and gender differences. It should alsobe valid and reliable between observers. T able 8.1 describes several commonly used tools for painassessment in the ED. Most of the tools are numerical. The Adjectival Rating Scale features six phrases describing painintensity in ascending order. These are arrayedon a 10-cm baseline. They offer the same infor-mation as the numerical tools but with the num-bers removed, an advantage for those patientswho cannot describe their pain numerically. The Numerical Rating Scale is the most com- monly used pain scale. It involves asking thepatient to rate his or her pain on a scale from 0 to10. In this scale, 0 is equivalent to no pain, 1 isequivalent to barely perceptible pain, and 10 represents the greatest pain that the patient has ever experienced or could imagine. Even adultswho are native speakers of the same language as Table 8.1 Self-report assessments for pain Adjectival None Mild Moderate Severe Very Worst Comments severe possible Numerical 0 5 10 Routine bedside evaluation Visual analog scale None Worst When hard copy (VAS) (10 cm baseline) imaginable needed Hurt thermometer White Blue Red Bedside Pictorial (faces) /H110226 years old Pieces of Hurt 0 1 2 3 4 /H110223 years old (poker chips)Thumb-to-index Some toddlers finger distancePrinciples of Emergency Medicine 133Pain managementthe care providers have difficulty with this con- cept. Adults conversing in their second or non-native language may not be able to understandthis scale or be able to express their pain ade-quately. Most children do not understand this atall: \"big hurt,\" as opposed to \"little hurt\" may bethe most that they can manage verbally. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is the most widely used scale for clinical research. This is a100 mm scale that has \"no pain\" on the left end and\"maximum possible pain\" on the right. Patientsindicate a point on the scale to correspond to theirlevel of pain. Visual, manual, and some conceptualskills are required for patients to be able to dothis. Patients seem able to r eliably indicate a point to describe the level of their pain, and to shift thispoint in an expected direction after therapy. Themajor limitation of the VAS is that the distance thatconstitutes a significant clinical change has notbeen validated. Most studies indicate that a changeof 13 mm constitutes a statistically significantchange, but this does not necessarily correlate withclinical significance. The Faces scale (Figure 8.1) seems to work well for younger school-age children. The scale isself-explanatory and has strong agreement amongchildren about the severity of pain reflected inthe faces. The scale has also demonstrated adequate test-retest reliability. The Hurt thermometer scale has faces super- imposed on a scale on which the left end is whiteand represents no pain. From left to right, the colorprogresses from blue to red, with the bright-redend at the right representing maximal pain. Thisprobably has no advantage in the assessment ofpain in children, but may help assess pain inpatients whose primary language differs frommembers of the health care team. The Poker Chip Tool or Pieces of Hurt scale works well for preschool children. The childgives between one and four poker chips to thecare provider to indicate the \"size\" of pain thechild is currently experiencing. For even youngerchildren, the thumb-to-index-finger measure mentoffers another modality of pain communication.The child indicates the severity of his or her painby spreading the thumb from the index finger.Children seem able to grasp subunit quantitywhen expressed as a change in the relationship ofbody parts at a much younger age than they canwith objects such as building blocks. Nonself-report assessment Infants, toddlers, cognitively-impaired patients,and those who do not speak the language of thehealth care team cannot effectively communicatetheir pain by the usual self-report scales. Thephysician is reduced to careful searching for cuesthat suggest the presence of pain. Soliciting com-ments from caregivers may help with the assess-ment of the patient's pain and the effectivenessof treatment. Neonates have a limited repertoire of expres- sion, and their ability to show body posturing iseven further limited by the prevailing fashion ofwrapping or swaddling. Evaluation of neonatalfacial expressions provides the best estimate oftheir level of pain, even when their face is par-tially obscured by a nipple or pacifier. Of 10 possible facial actions in neonates, three providethe most reliable indicators of pain: the furrowedbrow, the forehead bulge (just above the eye-brows), and squeezing of the eyes. Other facialactions include the nasolabial furrow, which canbe obscured by a pacifier, open lips, horizontaland vertical mouth stretch, taut tongue, chinquiver, lip purse, and tongue protrusion. The cryin response to pain tends to be more high-pitchedand drawn out than the usual cry for food or diaper changing. Caregivers are often able todescribe how the current cry differs from theusual cry, and whether or not the baby is moredifficult to console. Moaning or whimpering isnot normal for a neonate. The FLACC scale (face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability) is sometimes useful in infants No pain Mild Moderate SevereWorst possible 02468 1 0 Figure 8.1 Faces scale.(Table 8.2). Facial distortions due to pain are described above. The limbs are assessed for rigidity and muscle tone. In the infant with severe cerebralpalsy or known spasticity, this may not prove help-ful in the assessment of pain. Crying and consola-bility are assessed with the help of the caregivers. Assessment of pain in patients with limited communication skills is very challenging. Patientswith developmental disabilities or cognitiveimpairment are often unable to express pain. It isunclear whether their neurologic impairmentmeans that these patients do not actually experi- ence pain, or if the pain experience is diminishedfor them. There are no valid or reliable tools forassessment of pain in patients with significantneurologic impairment. As much as possible, theclinician should keep caregivers at hand to assistwith communication and management, maintaintypical means of communication (e.g., patient'slaptop), maintain typical means of comfort andmobility (e.g., wheelchair, form board), andremember that improved function may not mean that the pain has completely abated. Treatment of pain Expediting relief Patients generally wait too long for their pain tobe treated. Untreated pain has physiologic conse-quences and must be mitigated as soon as possible.Treatment should begin even before a definitive diagnosis has been established. Multiple studieshave shown that patients who have undifferenti-ated abdominal pain, even children, can safelyreceive analgesics without a worse outcome. The need for informed consent in the immediate future is often given as a reason for withholdingpain therapy. The concern that analgesics maycompromise a patient's competency (ability tounderstand and sign an informed consent formfor a pr ocedure) is unfounded. Analgesia can be titrated so that the patient's consciousness is not clouded. Additionally, if absolutely necessary, an opioid antagonist can be administered. Pain itself can alter mood and thought. Furthermore, the patient may detect an element of coercion if he or she is told that pain medication will only be given after the consent is signed. Safety, speed of onset, and ease of pain medi- cation administration are key elements to painrelief in the ED setting. First, the patient must be monitored, and safety measures (such as puttingup the gurney's side rails) must be instituted. The agent and route of administration must ensure rapid onset of adequate analgesia. In general, IVor inhalational routes ensure the fastest onset ofaction. Sophisticated techniques exist for deliver-ing analgesia to specific sites. Many of these, suchas intrathecal opioids, are too complicated and cum bersome for use in the ED environment. Some times, establishing an IV can be extremely difficult, especially in toddlers or chronically-ill patients with friable or scarred veins. Trans-mucosal absorption of drugs (fentanyl) may pro-vide relief of pain and may help the patientcooperate better during attempts at IV access.Intranasal administration of ketamine, midazo-lam, and sufentanil of fers Nonpharmacologic modalities Physical and psychologic comfort measures canset the tone for an ED visit, and help relieve painand anxiety while preparations are under wayfor delivery of pharmacologic analgesia.

Fear and anxiety exacerbate a patient's pain and suffering. The ED environment is unfamiliar tomost patients, and the patients feel dependent onstrangers for help. Patients may also fear that theirinjury may result in permanent disability, or thattheir pain may be due to cancer. Young childrenoften fear that their pain is punishment for per-ceived misdeeds, and often believe that the bodypart that hurts will be amputated. Anxiety andanger on the part of family members may alsoheighten a patient's pain. Early reassurance thatthe patient and his or her family and friends willbe treated with respect and compassion helpsdecrease suf fering and ameliorate pain. Offering a patient choices whenever possible (e.g., where theIV will be placed) lessens the feeling of loss of control. Letting the patient know approximatelyhow long it will take to obtain the medication,before the medication begins working, andwhether to expect relief to be partial or full areimportant as well. For pediatric patients, music, storytelling, blowing bubbles, and other verbal or imagerytechniques can distract the child from a painfulprocedure as well as reduce anxiety (Table 8.3).The Child Life Department, if available, can beinvaluable in providing positive interactions withchildren and caregivers. Pharmacologic therapy Pharmacologic therapy can be either curative orpalliative. Relief of cardiac chest pain by thevasodilatory effect of nitroglycerin is an exampleof curative therapy. This chapter deals primarilywith palliative therapy; once a diagnosis has beenestablished, curative therapy is preferred overpalliation alone if possible. Non-opioid agents Non-opioid agents are listed in Table 8.4. Acetaminophen Acetaminophen is an effective analgesic for mild to moderate pain. Its mechanism of action isunclear, yet it seems to act centrally.Acetaminophen has little anti-inflammatory effectand few gastrointestinal side effects. It does notaffect platelet aggregation. Significant hepato-toxicity is known to occur with large overdoses. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs The mechanism of action of NSAIDs is thought to be due to inhibition of prostaglandin, and possiblyleukotriene production. Alone, prostaglandinsdo not cause pain, but sensitize nerve endings toperceive an ordinary, non-painful stimulus aspainful. NSAIDs are widely used for theirantipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties, inaddition to their analgesic properties. They areeffective for mild to moderate pain, and theirlack of respiratory depression and abuse poten-tial makes them an attractive choice. There is a\"ceiling effect\" beyond which no further analge-sia can be produced, even when a differentNSAID is added. Their major side effects include Principles of Emergency Medicine 135Pain managementTable 8.3 Analgesic modalities and their mechanisms of action Distraction Cognitive focus away from pain Music Cognitive focus away from pain and decreased anxiety Hypnosis Cognitive reinterpretation of painful stimuli Biofeedback Decreases muscle tension Placebo Activates descending pain inhibitorypathways.

The same anal-gesics that are effective in adults can be safelyadministered to children greater than 2 monthsof age. In children, the margin of safety of thesedrugs approximately equals that in adults. Aspirin Aspirin may cause Reye's syndrome in children who contract influenza or chickenpox. Aspirin isnow seldom used in children, except to treatautoimmune diseases such as juvenile rheuma-toid arthritis. Ketorolac tromethamine Ketorolac is the first non-opioid analgesic agent available for parenteral use in the US. For acute musculoskeletal pain, 60 mg ketorolacadministered IM has been shown approximately Pain management 136 Principles of Emergency MedicineTable 8.4 Non-opioid analgesics Generic Dose Pediatric dose Toxic dose Maximum dose (proprietary) Acetaminophen 650-1000 mg PO 10-20 mg/kg PO Not q4-6 h 20-40 mg/kg q4 h unknown.

Ketorolac inhibits prostaglandin syn-thesis, so its onset is no faster than that of anequivalent agent given orally. Ketorolac is con-sidered to be most useful in the context of renalcolic because decreased prostaglandin synthesisresults in decreased ureteral peristalsis. In the- ory, opioids increase smooth muscle spasm and peristalsis; nonetheless, opioids have proven to beeffective analgesics in renal colic and should beconsidered as standard therapy. Ketorolac isapproximately 10-35 times more expensive than morphine. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-1) serves as a reparative agent and is not inducible with stimu-lation from inflammation or injury. COX-2 is pres- ent in lower levels and is inducible, showingincreases that are closely related to the inflamma-tory response to injury or inflammation. Mosttraditional NSAIDs block both COX-1 and COX-2. The and celecoxib provide anti-inflammatory effects andmoderate analgesia with a lower incidence of gas-trointestinal side effects. Both are eliminated bythe liver, and share similar drug interactions withstandard NSAIDs. They may precipitate anaphyl-axis in patients with ismetabolized by the cytochrome P450 system andmay have a sulfona-mide allergy. Rofecoxib (Vioxx) has been takenoff the market because of its association with anincreased incidence of myocardial infarction. General guidelines for choosing non-opioid analgesic agents 1.Use cautiously in the elderly, who are at greater risk of developing gastrointestinalbleeding, renal toxicity and renal failure. 2.Patients who are dehydrated or hypovolemic are at high risk of acute renalimpairment. 3.All have the potential for gastrointestinal sideeffects. 4.They may interfere with the effects of manyantihypertensives. 5.There is little clinical evidence of individualsuperiority of one particular agent overanother. 6.Newer agents may cost as much as fifty timesmore than older ones.Opioid analgesic agents Opioid analgesics are the mainstay of pharmaco-logic management of acute, moderate to severepain (Table 8.5). The beneficial physiologic andpsychologic effects of opium have been well docu-mented for centuries; so have its toxicity and potential for abuse. Fear of inducing addictionhas led to the underuse of opioids by manyphysicians. However, many studies use of opioid analgesics for acutepain syndromes is not associated with futuredependence. There are multiple opioid receptors, each affected by op ioids in different ways. The most commonly aneurotransmitter - when the receptor recognizesthe agonist, it causes alterations within the cell.An antagonist blocks receptor by occupyingit without initi ating transduction. Partial agonists produce a partial response with decreased intrin-sic activity. By binding the receptor site, they also block access of full agonists and function as par-tial antagonists. Morphine Morphine is the gold standard opioid agent. In standard dosage, it produces analgesia withoutloss of consciousness. Relief of tension, anxiety,and pain then results in drowsiness and sleep.Nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and miosis are the most common side effects. Vasodilatation andvenous pooling from morphine do not cause sig-nificant hemodynamic in normovolemicpatients, but cause patients. Morphine causes dose- dependent depr ession of ventilation, reducing the respiratory rate and then tidal volume. Morphine increases sphincter tone at the pylorus, ileo-cecaljunction, and constipation. Fentanyl over morphine include a rapid onset ( /H110211 minute) and brief duration of action (30-45 minutes). It is 50-100 times morepotent than morphine and has little hypnotic orsedative effect. Fentanyl's main disadvantage isthe glottic and chest wall rigidity that maydevelop after rapid infusion of higher doses Principles of Emergency Medicine 137Pain management(/H110225mcg/kg). The mechanism of the \"rigid chest\" syndrome is unclear, but can be life-threatening, since assisted ventilation may be impossible with-outmuscle relaxants. Hydromorphone Hydromorphone is a derivative of morphine, and has greater selectivity for /H9262-opioid receptors. It has a rapid onset of action and lasts 4-6 hours.Hydromorphone is five times more potent andten times more lipid soluble than morphine, yetless sedating. It also produces less nausea. Opioid drug selection The idea that some opioids are weak and inef-fective in severe pain is outdated. In equipotentdoses, opioid agents can achieve the same effectas other opioids, but differ in their side effects and half-life. Factors affecting drug selection include: the intensity of the pain, coexisting disease, poten-tial drug interactions, treatment history, physicianpreference, patient preference, and proposedroute of administration. Choice of route of administration Injectable The IV route results in the shortest time to onset of pain relief. There is no \"maximal\" dose of opi-oid; induction of undesired side effects usuallysignals the limit of patient's ability to toleratethe drug. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) iscommonly used in the inpatient setting forsevere pain that is expected to last for hours ordays. In general, PCA does not have a role in the Pain management 138 Principles of Emergency MedicineTable 8.5 Opioid analgesics Generic Oral equipotent Parenteral Duration Comments Precautions (proprietary) dose (in hours) Morphine 30-60 mg 10 mg 3-5 Standard for comparison Respiratory mg/kg) Sedation Histamine analgesic Constipation, nausea (2 mg/kg) (0.5 mg/kg) Good cough and vomiting, abuse suppressant potential Hydromorphone 2-6 Lortab) suppressant potential side effects than potency Oxycodone 5-10 mg N/A 3 Parenteral form not Euphoria, abuse (Percocet, Tylox) available in the US.

The IM route has multiple disadvantages. Among them, the pain of the injection limits thephysician's ability to titrate the drug effect. Fur-thermore, drug uptake is variable, depending onthe patient's peripheral circulation. Oral First-pass hepatic metabolism may inactivate as much as 80% of an oral opioid dose. Patients whowill require general anesthesia cannot take any-thing by mouth. Patients who are vomiting willnot be able to retain the drug long enough forabsorption to occur. Time to onset of analgesia ismuch longer and titration is more difficult. Out-patient pain control after discharge is the mainreason to use oral opioids. Rectal The rectal route has the advantages of transmu- cosal absorption without the first-pass effect.Additionally, it does not rely on gastric motility.Absorption, however, is variable. Patients may object to this route of administration. Hydromor-phone is the only opioid available as a suppository.The IV form can also be given rectally. Transmucosal Fentanyl lollipops are the most common form of opioid using the transmucosal route. This is espe-cially helpful in childr en, but requires patient cooperation. Combination therapy The combination of a non-opioid analgesic andan opioid agent produces significantly greaterpain relief than either agent alone. Use of adjuvant agents Adjuvant agents are used in combination withopioids for various reasons: to provide synergy;to decrease side effects; to decrease anxiety; andto relax muscles, especially in acute musculoskel-etal pain. The phenothiazines and hydroxyzine are most commonly used. There is no evidence,however, for analgesic synergy with these agents.Phenothiazines do not potentiate analgesia, aspreviously believed, and may actually diminishthe analgesic effect of the simultaneously admin-istered opioid. Hydroxyzine not only requires anadditional injection, but also increases respiratorydepression. In severe musculoskeletal pain associ-ated with muscle spasm, the addition of a musclerelaxant may provide more relief than an opioid alone. In this scenario, respiratory status must bemonitored closely. In general, adjuvant agentsprovide little additional analgesia and may poten-tiate or add side effects to the clinical picture. Special patients Undifferentiated abdominal pain Fear of masking the clinical findings and missingthe diagnosis has long prevented physiciansfrom giving opioids to patients with undifferen-tiated abdominal pain, leaving them to suffer forhours while establishing a diagnosis and definitivetreatment. This practice was first promulgatedby Cope, from his 1921 text The Early Diagnosis of Abdominal Pain . \"If morphine be administered, it is possible to die happy in the belief that he is onthe road to recovery, and in some cases, the med- ical attendant may for a time be induced to share the same delusive hope.\" Newer diagnostic tech-niques, better monitoring, and more accurateopioid titration have made his dire warningobsolete. In fact, the most recent edition of Cope'stextbook retracts this myth. Several studies havedocumented that early pain relief in patients withacute abdominal pain is safe and does not resultin worse outcomes, even in children. Migraine headaches There have been many studies comparing theeffectiveness of non-opioid agents to opioids inthe management of migraine Thephenothiazines as highas 95%. Sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine havebeen associated with recurrence rates as high as50%, especially in patients with persistingheadache at the time of discharge from the ED.Many other drugs (metoclopramide, haloperidol,droperidol, NSAIDs, and narcotics) have beenstudied. The relative benefit of any of these drugsor any combinations has not been established.Opioids have not been shown to perform betterin clinical trials and have the potential to be associ-ated with subsequent drug-seeking behavior. Principles of Emergency Medicine 139Pain managementChronic pain The patient with a terminal illness and chronic pain should receive generous amounts of opioidswhile the physician searches for a new processthat might have caused increased pain. Thesepatients will have great tolerance for the anal- gesic effects of opioids , but not necessarily for their side effects. Patients who have chronic painwith a non-terminal illness should be under thecare of a primary care provider who has a planfor managing this pain. Close consultation withthat primary care provider, or the pain manage-ment team, if applicable, will optimize thepatient's care and reduce dependency and abuse. Suspected drug-seeker Some patients will feign pain or claim pain syn-drome diagnoses in order to receive opioids,either for their own use or to sell. Suspecteddrug-seeking behavior should be documentedand will become evident as the number of EDvisits increase. In general, it is better to err on theside of humane treatment than to deprive apatient of needed pain relief. Diligence in check-ing the history and physical for inconsistencies,communicating with the patient's primary careprovider, and checking the medical records willhelp identify drug seekers and drug-seeking behavior. Non-narcotic medications should be substituted when possible. Prescriptions shouldbe written for only small amounts of medication,in matching alphabetic and numeric formats. Communication between the primary care provider and ED personnel will serve not only toconfirm the physician's suspicions, but can alsoprovide the basis for a consistent care plan forfuture visits. Documentation of findings and dis-cussions are necessary parts of the medical record. Pearls and pitfalls Pearls Treat pain early and often; anticipate pain prior to its recurrence. R eassess patients frequently. Use enough agent to achieve the desiredeffect, or until an undesirable side effectoccurs. Switch to a different agent if sideeffects occur and pain persists, or if the initialagent is not effective. Select the route of administration that allowsthe fastest relief for the patient but neitherdelays definitive care nor causes unnecessary,additional discomfort. Pitfalls Wrong agent : Most opioids can achieve the desired degree of analgesia. A majorexception is oral codeine. Codeine is a weakagonist with a high incidence of nausea,vomiting, and constipation; it has not beenshown to be more effective thanacetaminophen alone. Wrong dosage : Titrate the dosage to achieve the desired degree of analgesia. There is no\"maximal\" dose of any opioid. Wrong route : The IM route has several disadvantages: pain, delayed onset of action,unpredictable uptake, difficult and painfultitration, and complications such ashematoma formation or damage to structuresin the path of the injection. Wrong frequency : Preventing pain from recurring by earlier readministration of opioid will result in less opioid use overallthan the retreatment of pain that has hadtime to reestablish itself. Incorrect use of adjuvant agents : Adjuvant agents do not reduce the dosage of opioidneeded. Antiemetics may be used if nauseaand vomiting persist after adequate analgesiahas been achieved. The sedation orrespiratory depression that occurs with most of the commonly-used adjuvant agents isundesirable. References 1.Acute Pain Management GuidelinePanel.

Urinary-related complaints 543Primary Complaints 145Abdominal pain Scope of the problem Evaluation of the patient with acute abdominal pain is one of the most challenging aspects ofemergency medicine. Abdominal pain is the pre-senting complaint in as many as 10% of emergencydepartment (ED) patients. Diagnostic possibilitiesrange from immediately life-threatening condi-tions (e.g., ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm(AAA)), to self-limiting (e.g., abdominal wallstrain), and from common (e.g., gastroenteritis) tounusual (e.g., black widow spider bite). Thoughthe etiology of pain is initially undetermined in ashigh as 30-40% of patients, recognition of surgicalor life-threatening causes is more important thanestablishing a firm diagnosis. Anatomic essentials Abdominal pain is typically derived from one ormore of three distinct pain pathways: visceral,parietal (somatic) and referred. Visceral abdominal pain Visceral abdominal pain is usually caused by dis- tention of hollow organs or capsular stretching ofsolid organs. Less commonly, it is caused byischemia or inflammation when tissue conges-tion sensitizes nerve endings of visceral painfibers and lowers the threshold for stimulus. Oftenthe earliest manifestation of a particular diseaseprocess, visceral pain may vary from a steady acheor vague discomfort to excruciating or colickypain. If the involved organ is affected by peristal-sis, the pain is often described as intermittent,crampy, or colicky in nature. Since the visceral pain fibers are bilateral, unmyelinated, and enter the spinal cord at mul-tiple levels, visceral abdominal pain is usuallydull, poorly localized and experienced in themidline. Visceral pain is perceived from theabdominal region corresponding to the diseasedorgan's embryonic origin. Foregut structures,such as the stomach, duodenum, liver, biliarytract and pancreas produce upper abdominalpain, often in the epigastric region. Midgut structures, such as the small bowel, appendixand proximal colon cause periumbilical pain.Hindgut structures, such as the distal colon andgenitourinary system cause lower abdominal pain. Parietal (somatic) abdominal pain Parietal or somatic abdominal pain results or stretching of the par-ietal peritoneum. Myelinated afferent fiberstransmit the painful stimulus to specific dorsalroot ganglia on the same side and dermatomal level as the origin of the pain. For this reason,parietal pain, in contrast to visceral pain, oftencan be localized to the region of the painful stimu-lus. This pain is typically sharp, knife-like andconstant; coughing and moving are likely toaggravate it. Conditions resulting in parietalpain often account for physical examinationfindings of tenderness to palpation, guarding,rebound and rigidity. The classic presentation of appendicitis involves both visceral and somatic pain. Thepain of early appendicitis is often periumbilical(visceral) but localizes to the right lower quad-rant (RLQ) when the inflammation extends tothe peritoneum (parietal). Referred pain Referred pain is defined as pain felt at a distancefrom the diseased organ. It results from sharedcentral pathways for afferent neurons from dif-ferent locations. For instance, a patient withpneumonia may present with abdominal painbecause the T9 distribution of neurons is sharedby the lung and abdomen. Other examples ofreferred pain include epigastric pain associated with myocardial infarction (MI), shoulder painassociated disease, and testicular painassociated with acute ureteral obstruction. History In patients with abdominal pain, a careful andfocused history is the key to uncovering the eti-ology of most cases.9Abdominal pain S.V . Mahadevan, MDAbdominal pain 146 Primary ComplaintsWhere is your pain? Has it always been there? The location of abdominal pain often corresponds to specific disease entities and is very importantfor the development of an initial differential diag-nosis (Figure 9.1). Keep in mind that the locationof abdominal pain may vary with time, especiallyas the underlying disease evolves and the painprogresses from visceral to somatic. Periumbilicalpain that to the is very specific forappendicitis, while epigastric pain that localizesto the right upper quadrant (RUQ) is classic forbiliary disease. Does the pain radiate anywhere? The pain of biliary colic may radiate to right infrascapular region; the pain of pancreatitis tothe midback. Pain that radiates to the flank orgenitals may represent a kidney stone or rup-tured AAA. How did the pain begin (sudden vs. gradual onset)? How long have you had the pain? Sudden or abrupt onset of abdominal pain often indicates a serious underlying disorder. Faintingor collapsing with such pain is worrisome forconditions such as a ruptured AAA, perforatedulcer or ectopic pregnancy. Inflammatory causesof pain (cholecystitis, appendicitis, diverticulitis)tend to develop over hours to days and generallyare less severe at the onset. Pain for /H110226 hours or/H1102148 hours duration, or pain that is steadily increasing in intensity is more likely to requiresurgical intervention. Diffuse pain Acute pancreatitisAortic dissection or ruptured abdominal aneurysmBowel rupture, infarction or aneurysm Figure 9.1 Differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain by location. Adapted from Wagner DK. Curr Topic 1978;1(3).Primary Complaints 147Abdominal painWhat were you doing when the pain began? Severe pain that awakens a patient from sleep is concerning and may represent perforation orischemia. This history of abdominal pain followingtrauma raises the possibility of an intra-abdominalinjury to the solid organs or bowel. What does the pain feel like? The significance of the patient's characterization of pain (visceral, somatic, referred) is describedin detail earlier in this chapter. Classic descrip-tions of pain include the burning or gnawingpain of peptic ulcer disease, the sharp pain of biliary colic, the penetrating pain of pancreatitis,the tearing pain of an aortic dissection, and thecrampy intermittent pain of intestinal obstruction. On a scale of 0-10, how severe is the pain? Unfortunately, the patient's quantification of pain severity is often inconsistent and generally unreli-able in determining the specific cause of pain.Studies have shown that elderly patients tend to have a higher pain threshold than youngerpatients. In general, nonsurgical causes of paintend to be less painful than surgical etiologies.Although acute nephrolithiasis (kidney stone)may present with severe, incapacitating pain, themajority of patients will spontaneously pass theirstone without surgical intervention. The finding ofsevere pain \"out of proportion\" to physical exami-nation is worrisome for mesenteric ischemia. Does anything make the pain better or worse? Parietal peritoneal pain is aggravated by move-ment, such as hitting bumps on the car ride to thehospital or with walking. This finding necessitatesthe exclusion of appendicitis. The pain of pepticulcer disease typically improves with eating,whereas biliary colic worsens with meals. Painaccentuated by reclining and relieved by sittingupright should raise suspicion for a retroperi-toneal process such as pancreatitis. Abdominalpain relieved by vomiting suggests a gastric orproximal bowel problem, whereas relief of painafter a bowel movement suggests a colonic process. Have you had the pain before? Some patients with abdominal pain have had prior similar episodes. It has been reported thatprior pain events occur in up to 71% of patientswith cholecystitis and in 18% of patients withappendicitis. Associated symptoms Gastrointestinal Ask about nausea, vomiting, anorexia, constipation, diarrhea or bleeding .Nausea and vomiting may result from irritation of intra-abdominal organs or obstruction of an involuntary muscular tube(i.e., intestine, bile duct, ureter). Consequently,nausea and vomiting are common to manyabdominal processes, including appendicitis.However, vomiting may also be slight or absentfrom many serious surgical conditions (ectopicpregnancy, intussusception). The temporal rela-tionship of abdominal pain and vomiting isanother key historical finding. Classically, patientswith appendicitis or other surgical causes ofabdominal pain develop pain prior to vomiting.The reverse is often true in medical conditions,where vomiting may precede pain. Any childpresenting with bilious vomiting raises concernfor an acute bowel obstruction. Contrary to popular belief, anorexia is not a requisite finding for the diagnosis of appendicitis, as it is absent in 10-30% of cases. Constipationand diarrhea occur with equal frequency (15% ofcases) in appendicitis. Diarrhea may accompanya partial small bowel obstruction (SBO) despitethe common misconception that any bowelmovement excludes this condition. Bloody diar-rhea is suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease or infectious enterocolitis. A bloody or \"currantjelly\" (blood and mucus) stool may indicateintussusception, although this is generally a latefinding. Failure to pass flatus or feces could beassociated with an intestinal obstruction. Genitourinary Ask about dysuria, frequency, urgency and hema- turia .Though dysuria and urinary frequency are classic symptoms of a urinary tract infection(UTI), they can also occur as the result of bladderirritation by an inflamed appendix or pelvicorgan. Gross hematuria may indicate bladderirritation or nephrolithiasis. Gynecologic Ask about pregnancy, menses, contraception, fertility, sexual activity, sexually transmitted infections (STIs),Abdominal pain 148 Primary Complaintsvaginal discharge or bleeding and dypareunia. Previous gynecologic history including surgeries, previouspregnancies and infections are also important to identify . A patient may mistake abnormal vaginal bleeding for their menses. Painful menses in apatient without a history of dysmenorrhea shouldraise concern for a serious gynecologic condition.Ectopic pregnancy should be considered in all female patients between the ages of 9 and 50 yearswith abdominal pain. Pregnancy not only alters the diagnostic pos- sibilities of a patient with acute abdominal painbut can also change the clinical findings.Advanced pregnancies make the diagnosis ofappendicitis more difficult - not only does thelocation of the appendix change with the pro-gression of the pregnancy, but these patients tendto have fewer clinical findings than non-pregnantpatients. Cardiopulmonary Ask about cough, dyspnea and chest pain. Pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute MI may present with abdominal pain as the chief com-plaint. Abdominal pain may be the result of otherextra-abdominal causes (Table 9.1).Past medical Previous abdominal surgery is an importantrisk factor for bowel obstruction due to adhe-sions. Patients with a history of cardiovasculardisease, hypertension or atrial fibrillation are atrisk for mesenteric ischemia and AAA. Ongoing medical illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease,or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)may complicate the evaluation and stabilizationof patients with abdominal pain. Certain medica-tions (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs), corticosteroids, antibiotics, immuno-suppressants) may lead to abdominal pain ormake its evaluation more challenging. Alcoholconsumption places patients at risk for pancrea-titis, hepatitis or cirrhosis. Physical examination The primary goal of the physical examination isto localize the organ system responsible for dis-ease. It is important not only to examine theabdomen but other body areas as well that mayprovide clues to the etiology of the pain, espe-cially the pelvic (women), genitourinary (men),back, and rectal areas. General appearance The general appearance of a patient is an import-ant clinical observation. As a general rule, patientswith pallor or distress are generally more acutelyill. Patients whose disease process has progressedto peritonitis tend to lie still to avoid exacerbatingtheir pain. Patients with ureteral colic or mesen-teric ischemia may writhe in pain because theycannot find a position of comfort. Nonspecificabdominal pain, gastroenteritis and ureteral colicare usually less aggravated by movement. Vital signs The absence of a fever, often used as a marker to identify infection, can be deceiving in patients with abdominal pain. Diseases such as appendicitis and cholecystitis may presentwith temperatures /H11021100.2\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C). Elderly or immunocompromised patients may not mount afever despite serious underlying illness. Themajority of elderly patients with acute appen-dicitis or cholecystitis are afebrile in spite ofhigher rates of perforation and sepsis. The presence of fever should alert the phys- ician to the possibility of infection as the cause ofpain.

Emerg Med Clin North Am 1989;7:721-740.Table 9.1 Important extra-abdominal causes of abdominal painPrimary Complaints 149Abdominal painmake appendicitis less likely than pneumonia or pyelonephritis in the appropriate clinical setting. Other vital signs may be helpful in assessing the degree to which a patient is affected by his or her illness. Hypotension may be a result of dehydration, sepsis or internal hemorrhage, andis a worrisome finding in an elderly patient.Tachycardia may signify occult blood loss, sep- sis, volume contraction or pain. However, med-ications such as beta-blockers may blunt thepatient's ability to mount such a response. Anincreased respiratory rate may result from severepain, acidosis or an extra-abdominal cause suchas PE, pneumonia or MI. Abdomen Inspection Inspection may reveal distention, masses, bruis- ing, scars from prior surgeries or cutaneous signsof portal hypertension. Cullen's sign (a bluishumbilicus) and Grey Turner's sign (discol oration of the flank) are signs of internal hemorrhage, although infrequently seen in the acute setting. Auscultation Auscultation is performed prior to palpation because the latter may induce peristalsis artifi-cially. Contrary to conventional teaching, absentor diminished bowel sounds provide little usefulclinical information. In one investigation, approxi-mately half the patients with confirmed perito- nitis had normal or increased bowel sounds. High-pitched or tinkling sounds can be asso- ciated with SBO, especially in the presence ofabdominal distention. Low-pitched and less fre-quent bowel sounds are classically associatedwith a large bowel obstruction. The auscultationof bruits might indicate the presence of a AAA inan elderly patient. In the pregnant patient, assessfor fetal heart tones, which can be heard in 90%of patients by 12 weeks gestation. Percussion Percussion is useful for determining the size of organs and for distinguishing between distentioncaused by air or fluid. Tympany may be due toexcessive gas in the bowel or peritoneal cavity;shifting dullness or a fluid wave suggests ascites. Palpation For palpation of the abdomen to be effective, it is important to first calm the patient and gain his orher cooperation. Having the patient flex the legsat the knee and hip may relax abdominal muscu-lature, making palpation more effective. Be gen-tle. A rough or painful examination is not onlydistressing to the patient but may mislead theexamining physician. Palpation should be per-formed systematically, beginning as far as pos-sible from the patient's perceived location ofpain. It is important to observe the patient'sfacial expressions for signs of pain during palpa-tion. In older patients, careful palpation of theabdomen may also reveal a pulsatile mass sug-gestive of a AAA. It is rare for a serious abdominal condition to present without abdominal tenderness. By local-izing tenderness to a specific abdominal region,the clinician often can narrow the possible diag-noses to the organs within that anatomic region.Complicating matters, however, is the fact thatsome patients with inflamed intra-abdominalorgans do not have localizable tenderness. Forexample, only two-thirds of patients with appen-dicitis have RLQ tenderness on examination. In addition to localizing tenderness, the patient should be assessed for signs of peritoneal irrita-tion, the hallmark of surgical disease. Guarding Guarding is the reflex spasm of the abdominal wall musculature in response to palpation orunderlying peritoneal irritation (Figure 9.2). Figure 9.2 Guarding.Voluntary guarding can occur as a response to the physician's cold hands, fear, anxiety or being tick- lish. Involuntary guarding, which has greater clin-ical significance, is more likely to occur withsurgical illness and is not relieved by physicianencouragement. Rebound tenderness Rebound tenderness is elicited by slow, gentle, deep palpation of an area of tenderness followedby abrupt withdrawal of the examiner's hand(Figure 9.3). Though rebound tenderness hasclassically been a hallmark of surgical disease,several recent studies have questioned its sensi-tivity and specificity as well as its lack of prospec-tive utility for surgical conditions. As a result,some physicians have condemned the procedureas a cruel and uninformative holdover from the past. Alternatives to classic rebound testing include the cough test , where the examiner has the patient cough and looks for evidence of post-tussiveabdominal pain, such as grimacing, flinching orgrabbing the belly, and the heel drop sign , where the patient experiences pain on dropping the heelsto the ground after standing on his or her toes. Inchildren, this may be tested by having them jump up and down. Special signs or techniques Apositive Murphy's sign is elicited when a patient abruptly ends deep inspiration during palpationof the RUQ. Murphy's sign is very sensitive foracute cholecystitis and biliary colic. The psoas sign (Figure 9.4) is performed by having the patient flexthe thigh against resistance. The obturator sign (Figure 9.5) is performed by having the patientinternally and externally rotate their flexed hip.Pain elicited by either the psoas or obturatormaneuvers can indicate irritation of the respectivemuscles by an inflammatory process such as acute appendicitis, a ruptured appendix or pelvicinflammatory disease (PID). Apositive Rovsing's sign is pain in the RLQ pre- cipitated by palpation of the left lower quad rant (LLQ). This is also suggestive of appendicitis.Carnett's sign is increased tenderness to palpation when the abdominal muscles are contracted, aswhen the patient lifts his or her head or legs off thebed, and may be useful to distinguish abdominalwall from visceral pain. Pelvic Apelvic examination is mandatory in any woman of childbearing age with abdominal pain. Thepelvic examination may help differentiate agynecologic cause of pain from other causes.Cervical appearance, cervical motion tenderness (CMT), adnexal tenderness or masses, uterine Abdominal pain 150 Primary Complaints (a) (b) Figure 9.3 Rebound (a) hand down (b) hand up.size, and the presence or absence of discharge, pus or blood should be noted. While women withappendicitis or PID may have CMT or adnexal ten-derness, the presence of pus at the cervical os sug-gests PID. A woman with severe PID may alsoexperience RUQ tenderness due to perihepaticinflammation (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome).Genital Just as every woman of childbearing age needs apelvic examination, every male with abdominalpain should have a genital examination. The groinshould be inspected and palpated for herniaswhich may be the cause of an acute bowel obstruc-tion. The external genitalia and scrotum should also carefully be evaluated for any tenderness,masses, or abnormalities. Rectal Recent literature has questioned the utility of therectal examination in the diagnosis of appendi- citis, as it is neither sensitive nor specific for the disease. However, the rectal examination stillremains a necessary component of the evaluation of patients with abdominal pain. The diagnosis ofprostate or perirectal disease, stool impactions,rectal foreign bodies and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding all depend on the digital rectal examin-ation. Occult blood in the right clinical settingshould raise suspicion for intestinal ischemia. Back Gently percussing the costovertebral angles (CVA)of the back with a fist will elicit pain in patientswith pyelonephritis or obstructive uropathy. Head-to-toe Abdominal pain may be elicited by extra-abdominal causes, such as pharyngitis, pneumoniaand MI. These conditions can be missed withouta comprehensive physical examination.

Despite the association of an elevated white blood cell(WBC) count with many infectious and inflamma-tory processes, numerous studies have demon-strated that many patients with surgically-provenappendicitis have initially normal WBC counts.Even serial WBC counts have failed to discrimin-ate between surgical and nonsurgical illness. In the patient with abdominal pain, an elevated WBCdoes not necessarily imply serious disease, detect-ing only 53% of patients with severe abdominalpathology in one study. In fact, elevations of theWBC count may lead to additional tests andincreased costs without providing additional infor-mation. The CBC should never be used to makethe sole diagnosis of abdominal pathology, norshould it be used in isolation to exclude reasonablediagnostic possibilities. The bottom line is thatdecision-making in cases of abdominal pain restprimarily on a carefully taken history and thor-ough physical examination, not the WBC count. Urinalysis The urinalysis is a rapid, cost-effective adjunctive laboratory test that needs to be interpreted withcaution in patients with abdominal pain. Findings suggestive of UTI include pyuria, positive leuko-cyte esterase, positive nitrites and the presence ofbacteria. However, up to 30% of patients withappendicitis may present with blood, leukocytes oreven bacteria in their urine. A mild degree ofpyuria may be present in elderly patients at base-line. Be wary of ascribing abdominal pain to a UTIwhen the clinical picture does not fit. Red bloodcells (RBCs) in the urine are consistent with infec-tion, trauma, tumors and stones. The patient with acute flank pain and hematuria suggests renal colic but also may represent a leaking or ruptured AAA. Pregnancy test All female patients of childbearing age with abdominal pain should have a pregnancy test. Apositive pregnancy test expands the differential diagnosis (i.e., ectopic pregnancy), influences thechoice of medications or adjunctive studies, andmay impact disposition. Do not omit pregnancytesting in patients who report sexual abstinence,tubal ligation or contraceptive use. Amylase/lipase Though a serum amylase is commonly ordered when looking for pancreatitis, it may be normalin as many as a third of patients with pancreatitis.The serum amylase may also be elevated in otherconditions including ulcer or liver disease,SBO, common duct stones, intoxication and dia-betic ketoacidosis (DKA). Serum lipase has ahigher sensitivity and specificity for pancreatitisthan total amylase, and is therefore the most use-ful test in a patient with suspected pancreatitis. Other laboratories Liver function tests may be elevated in patients with biliary or hepatic disease. Serum electrolytesmay be abnormal in patients significantvomiting or diarrhea, symptoms /H1102224 hours dura- tion, diuretic use, or a history of kidney or liver disease. Serum phosphate and serum lactate maybe elevated in cases of bowel ischemia. Electrocardiogram Electrocardiograms (ECGs) should be considered for all patients with unex plained epigastric or abdominal pain. They are particularly essentialin the evaluation of elderly patients with vague,poorly localized abdominal complaints. An acutecoronary syndrome (ACS) or inferior MI canpresent with epigastric pain, diaphoresis andvomiting. Though a normal ECG in the setting of abdominal pain does not exclude an MI, it makes itless likely. Radiologic studies Plain films Abdominal plain films are markedly overutilized, difficult to interpret (even in experienced hands),and rarely provide useful clinical information.Plain films are unlikely to be helpful in patientswith nonspecific abdominal pain, suspectedappendicitis, and UTIs. In fact, they may cloudthe diagnosis leading to delays in management.Plain films of the abdomen should be restrictedto patients with suspected bowel obstruction,Primary Complaints 155Abdominal pain perforated viscus or foreign bodies. Even in these presentations, computed tomography (CT) scan-ning provides much more detailed information.When evaluating plain abdominal radiographs,look for abnormalities such as dilated loops oflarge or small bowel, air-fluid levels, abnormalcalcifications of the abdominal aorta or urinarytract, gallstones, and free air under the diaphragm(Figure 9.6). Ultrasound Ultrasound has emerged as an extremely useful diagnostic modality in patients with abdominalpain. Advantages of ultrasound include lack ofionizing radiation, low cost and widespread avail-ability. It is the preferred imaging approach forevaluating patients with RUQ pain. In patientswith acute cholecystitis, ultrasound may detectgallstones, gallbladder wall thickening, perichole-cystic fluid or a sonographic Murphy's sign. Ultrasound is also commonly used to make the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, particularly inchildren, thin adults, women of reproductive ageand pregnant patients. The primary sono graphiccriterion of appendicitis is demonstration of aswollen, noncompressible appendix /H110227mm in diameter with a target configuration (Figure 9.7). Figure 9.6 Pneumoperitoneum. AP erect chest X-ray reveals free air beneath the lefthemidiaphragm consistent with pneumoperitoneum. Figure 9.7Appendicitis on ultrasound. Gray scale longitudinalultrasound demonstrates enlarged consistent with :GM Garmel, MD.Abdominal pain 156 Primary ComplaintsAdditionally, ultrasound is useful in imaging the pelvic organs; the transvaginal approach is preferred and superior to the transabdominalapproach for the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Limited bedside ED ultrasonography can be used for: 1.confirming an intrauterine pregnancy which dramatically lowers the risk of ectopicpregnancy; 2.screening for the presence of a AAA(Figure 9.8); 3.screening for the presence of freeintraperitoneal blood in patients withabdominal trauma (see Appendix E). Ultrasound may be difficult to perform in obese patients and those in severe pain. As ultrasound requires considerable skill, findings are operator- dependent and interpretation errors can occur. Anegative ultrasound does not exclude the diag- nosis of either appendicitis or ectopic pregnancy. Abdominal computed tomography Abdominal CT has fast become the modality of choice in patients with undifferentiated abdom inal pain who require imaging, as it allows for apanorama-like visualization of the structures ofthe peritoneal and retroperitoneal space, unin-hibited by the presence of bowel gas or fat. Dueto its exceptional accuracy, CT is often the pri-mary imaging modality in patients with sus-pected appendicitis. CT findings of appendicitis(Figure 9.9) include a appen-dix often with a calcified appendicolith or periappendiceal a phlegmon or abscess maybe visible. CT is also useful for determining thediagnosis (and in many cases, the clinical severity)of conditions such as renal colic, bowel ischemia, of CT are the cost,radiation dose and availability. General treatment principles As with all ED patients, treatment begins with the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation). The maingoals of treatment are physiologic stabilization,symptom relief and preparation for surgical inter-vention when warranted. Volume repletion Not all patients with abdominal pain need intra-venous (IV) access or IV fluids. However, manypatients have some degree of volume contractionresulting from poor intake, vomiting and diar- rhea, or third-spacing. Other patients may have volume loss secondary to internal bleeding (e.g.,ectopic pregnancy). Crystalloids are the initialfluids of choice in both children and adults. Therate of repletion is determined by the degree of Figure 9.8 Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) ontransverse color Doppler sonogram.

Brooke Jeffrey, MD.Primary Complaints 157Abdominal painhypovolemia, the cardiovascular status of the patient, and the response of the patient to initialtherapy. Under certain circumstances, such aslife-threatening hemodynamic collapse, bloodproducts may be the initial resuscitation fluid. Pain relief Despite the long held opinion that narcotic anal-gesia masks peritoneal signs of an acute abdomen,there is no clear evidence supporting this notion. In fact, recent studies have revealed that theadministration of moderate doses of analgesiaand the ensuing pain relief do not cloud diagnos-tic findings; instead, this approach actually mayaid in the diagnosis of surgical disease. In theacute setting, pain relief is typically achieved withIV titration of opioid analgesics such as morphinesulfate or fentanyl. When combined with narcotic agents, IV ketorolac provides pain relief for patients with bil-iary and renal colic. Patients with epigastric dis-comfort may gain relief from a GI cocktail (variedcombinations of an antacid, viscous lidocaineand/or donnatal). Though the GI cocktail may betherapeutic, it is not diagnostic, as even pain froman acute MI may be relieved by this therapy. Antibiotics Antibiotics are indicated in patients with abdom-inal sepsis, suspected perforation, or the pres-ence of peritonitis (local or diffuse). Abdominalinfections often necessi-tate for enteric Gram-negatives, Gram-positives, and anaerobic the patient's pres- entation, comorbid conditions, and local bacterialdrug sensitivities and drug-resistance patterns. Other The control of emesis can be achieved by a num-ber of agents. Patients in whom surgery is antici-pated should be kept from eating or drinking(NPO). A nasogastric (NG) tube may be of benefit in patients with vomiting refractory to antiemetic administration or confirmed bowel obstruction. Special patients Elderly Several factors make the diagnosis and manage-ment of abdominal pain in elderly patients chal-lenging. Surgical causes of abdominal painincrease in incidence with advancing age, whereasnonspecific abdominal pain becomes less com-mon. Typically, surgical illness in elderly patientsis more rapidly life-threatening than in youngerpatients. Older patients are at much greater risk forvascular catastrophes such as ruptured AAA,mesenteric ischemia and MI. Elderly patients aremore likely to present without the classic orexpected historical or physical examination find-ings associated with a common disease. Because ofatypical presentations and comorbidities, patientmortality and rates of misdiagnosis increase expo-nentially each decade after age 50. This highlightsthe importance of considering surgical illness (andsurgical consultation) in most elderly patients withabdominal pain. About 40% of all patients /H1102265 years of age presenting to the ED with abdominalpain ultimately require surgery. Pediatric The diagnosis of abdominal pain in childrenpresents its own unique challenges. Historiesmust often be obtained from the children and caregivers. Children are not always able to articu-late their complaint or describe their symptoms.Consequently, younger children tend to presentwith late symptoms of disease and have a higherincidence of perforated appendicitis comparedto adults. The usual etiologies of abdominal painin children vary from those in adults (T able 9.3). Gastroenteritis, non specific abdominal pain and appendicitis are more common in children,whereas biliary disease, pancreatitis and vascu-lar disease are relatively rare. Illnesses relatively unique to children include intussusception, volvu-lus,pyloric stenosis and Hirschsprung's disease. Any child presenting with bilious vomiting should be presumed to have a bowel obstruction. Immune compromised In addition to ordinary afflictions such as appen-dicitis, patients with human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV) presenting with abdominal pain mayalso have: 1.enterocolitis with pancreatitis.Abdominal pain 158 Primary ComplaintsThe use of antibiotics, steroids or other immunosuppressants may mask abdominal exam- ination findi ngs usually associated with infec- tion, so consideration should be given to anyabdominal pain complaint, no matter how slight.Steroid use can lead to demargination of leuko-cytes, making interpretation of the WBC countmore difficult. Steroids also promote peptic ulcerdisease, leading to an increased incidence of per-forated viscus. Disposition Surgical consultation Patients with an acute abdomen or confirmed sur-gical illness require urgent surgical consulta tion. Life-threatening diagnoses such as rupturedAAA or ectopic pregnancy require emergent con-sultation and expedited tr eatment. The most com- mon causes of abdominal pain requiring surgical consultation are appendicitis, intestinal obstr uc- tion, perforated ulcer and acute cholecystitis.These patients should be kept well-hydrated andNPO. Early diagnosis and surgery for appendici-tis prevents perforation and the associated acute(abscess formation, sepsis) and late (scar forma- tion with bowel obstruction/infertility) compli- cations. Serial evaluation Observation with serial examinations allows theemergency physician an extended evaluation of apatient with an early or atypical presentation ofappendicitis or another acute abdominal process.These patients are kept in the ED or admitted tothe hospital for serial abdominal examinations.Serial evaluation, preferably by the same phys-ician, allows a patient's clinical picture to evolve orresolve over a period of time. Studies have shown that observation and repeated examinations ofpatients with suspected appendicitis improvediagnostic accuracy without increasing rates ofperforation. Discharge After a thorough work-up in the ED or serialobservation, patients without evidence of concern-ing medical or surgical illness may be discharged.Despite a patient's expectation of a firm diagnosis,it is perfectly acceptable to diagnose the patientwith nonspecific or undifferentiated abdominalpain. In fact, the majority of patients are dis-charged from the ED with this diagnosis. Avoidforcing a diagnosis on the patient such as acutegastroenteritis. True gastroenteritis requires thepresence of vomiting and diarrhea. When discharging a patient with undiag- nosed abdominal pain, it is important to arrangefor a repeat evaluation within 8-10 hours (eitherin the ED or with an outpatient clinic) and makeit clear to the patient to return to the ED if symp-toms worsen. Typically, patients are placed on aclear liquid diet and narcotic analgesics areavoided. For patients returning to the ED withworsening symptoms, the additional opportunityto establish the diagnosis should be welcomed.Typically, these patients are more likely to have appendicitis or bowel obstruction. Patients inwhom reliable follow-up cannot be arranged orassured may require admission.Birth to 1 Pneumonia PID Trauma Sickle cell crisis Testicular torsion UTI Trauma Threatened abortion Volvulus UTI PID: UTI: urinary tract infection.Adapted from Leung AKC, Sigalet DL. Acute abdominal pain in children. Am Fam Physician 2000;67(11).Table 9.3 Causes of abdominal pain by age of onsetPrimary Complaints 159Abdominal pain Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Do not restrict the diagnosis solely by the location of the pain. Consider appendicitis in all patients withabdominal pain and an appendix, especiallyin patients with the presumed diagnosis ofgastroenteritis, PID or UTI. Do not use the presence or absence of fever todistinguish between surgical and medicalcauses of abdominal pain. The WBC count is of little clinical value in thepatient with possible appendicitis. Any woman with childbearing potential andabdominal pain has an ectopic pregnancyuntil her pregnancy test comes back negative. Pain medications reduce pain and sufferingwithout compromising diagnostic accuracy. An elderly patient with abdominal pain has a high likelihood of surgical disease. Obtain an ECG in elderly patients and thosewith cardiac risk factors presenting withabdominal pain. A patient with appendicitis by history and physical examination does not need a CTscan to confirm the diagnosis; they need anoperation. The use of abdominal ultrasound or CT mayhelp evaluate patients over the age of 50 withunexplained abdominal or flank pain for thepresence of AAA.

They rep- resent one of the most challenging classes of patients the emergency physician must treat. Thecauses of abnormal behavior are exceedinglydiverse and require physicians to maintain a highlevel of vigilance to determine whether an under-lying medical disorder exists. In 1998, it was esti-mated that nearly 4% of the approximately 100.4million ED visits in the US were for behavioralproblems. Many of these patients present \"formedical clearance\" prior to an intended psychi-atric hospitalization. It is important that thesepatients be treated with the same sensitivity asevery patient in the ED. \"Medical clearance\"should include a comprehensive medical evalua-tion to identify any potential underlying medicalproblem that may be responsible for the changesin behavior. Pathophysiology The physiology of behavior represents a complexinterplay of human physiology and the environ-ment in which it exists. Historically, changes inbehavior have been classified as being of func-tional (psychiatric) or organic (medical) etiology.These classifications are dated, as neuropatho-physiologic mechanisms of psychiatric diseasehave advanced over the past decades. Examplesinclude aberrations in directed atmodu lation of these neurotransmitters has greatly advanced the treatment and prognosis of patientssuffering with these illnesses. History Prior to obtaining the history, the safety of thepatient and staff should be ensured. Patients whoare altered or violent may be unable or unwillingto give an adequate history. It is important to seekadditional sources of information from para-medics, police, family members or witnesses.Is this an acute or chronic condition? The temporal nature of these behavioral changes is a good place to start when obtaining the his-tory. Sudden behavioral changes in a previouslyhealthy person are more likely to herald anunderlying medical disorder. In contrast, demen-tia is characterized by progressively worseningcognitive function. If acute, what were the events leading up to the change in behavior? Is there an antecedent history of trauma, ingestion, medication noncompliance, or new medication(s)that might explain the patient's symptoms? Hasthe patient had a recent social stressor such asdifficulty with work, family or a relationship thatserves as the precipitant. Does the patient have a history of psychiatric illness? Patients with a history of psychiatric illness are more likely to have an underlying functional dis-order as the cause of their abnormal behavior.Ask the patient if he or she has a history of depres-sion, mania, schizophrenia or anxiety. Does the patient have a psychiatrist or psychotherapist? Ifso, it is important to attempt to contact that indi-vidual for additional history and consultationabout disposition once underlying medical ill- nesses have been excluded. Many patients suffer from undiagnosed depres sion. The mnemonic SIG-E-CAPS is helpful when evaluating patientsfor possible depression (Table 10.1).10 Abnormal behavior Tim Meyers, MDand Gus M.

Is there a suspected ingestion? Medications are commonly implicated as the eti- ology of acute behavioral changes. When takinga history regarding medication usage, the follow-ing information should be considered: 1.What are the prescribed and over-the-counter medications taken by the patient? 2.Is there a new medication that could becausing an adverse reaction (e.g., mefloquinefor malaria prophylaxis causes psychosis) oraltering behavior through a drug-druginteraction? 3.Is there a possibility of an accidental orintentional overdose? 4.Is the patient sharing or taking someoneelse's medications? Many medications are well known for causingalterations in mental status (Table 10.2). Thepatient should be questioned about any recentdosage adjustments. Even when patients havebeen on regularly scheduled doses, worseningrenal or hepatic insufficiency may cause medica- tions to become supratherapeutic (e.g., digoxintoxicity in the dehydrated elderly patient withworsening renal function) and precipitate alter-ations in behavior. Is the patient suicidal? Is there a history of suicide attempts or gestures? Is the patienthomicidal? Can the patient care forhim/herself? These questions are essential in identifying patients who require involuntary psychiatric admissionfor evaluation and treatment. Immediate stepsshould be taken to keep these patients fromharming themselves or others. Inquire about\"red flags\" for suicidality. These include guns orweapons at home, pills or access to them, previ-ous suicide attempts or recent stresses (job,finances, relationships, health). In addition, thephysician has a \"duty to warn\" parties who may beendangered as the result of a homicidal ideation.When trying to assess whether or not a patient is\"gravely disabled,\" determine if the patient isable to shower or bathe, feed adequately, ambulatesafely, manage finances, and make reasonablejudgments. The conditions under which a personcan be placed on an emergency psychiatric holdare a matter of state law and will be discussed later in this chapter. Is there a history of substance or physical abuse? Abnormal behavior is often the result of acute recreational drug or alcohol ingestion, or a with- drawal syndrome. Research reports that drugsand alcohol account for 21-60% of cases ofabnormal behavior seen in EDs. There is a higherincidence of substance abuse in patients who suf-fer from psychiatric illness; similarly, patientswith a history of substance abuse are more likelyto have an underlying psychiatric condition. Forpatients who are depressed, substance abuse isan independent risk factor for suicide. It is import-ant to ask patients, especially those with abnor- mal behavior, whether or not they are victims ofphysical, emotional, or sexual abuse. Associated symptoms Head, eye, ear, nose and throat (HEENT) : headache, diplopia, vision loss, pain. Chest : pain, cough, shortness of breath. Gastrointestinal (GI) : pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, incontinence,constipation. Genitourinary (GU) : pregnancy, bleeding, pain, discharge, incontinence,dysuria. Skin: rash, lesions. Neurologic : weakness, numbness, difficulty walking, vertigo, tinnitus. Psychiatric : mood, hallucinations (visual or auditory), anxiety, depression, suicidal,homicidal.Table 10.2 Drugs that cause Complaints 163Abnormal behavior Physical examination The physical examination represents a key aspect in the identification of underlying medicalpathology in patients with behavioral changes.In addition, it may provide clues to specific under-lying psychiatric diagnoses. Physicians and psych-iatrists infrequently perform complete physicalexaminations in patients with abnormal behav-ior. The medicolegal literature has documentedcases of fatal medical disorders inappropriatelydiagnosed as psychiatric illness. It is importantthat emergency physicians are meticulous in theirdata gathering from h istory and physical exami- nation to avoid missing medical illnesses respon- sible for abnormal behavior. General appearance The general appearance of the patient is a keyfeature of the physical examination. Is the patientalert? Is the patient violent or are there signs ofimpending violence, such as increased motoractivity, pressured speech, threatening postureand gestures? Is the patient clean, well groomedand appropriately attired? Vital signs These should be obtained as soon as safetyallows. Any vital sign abnormality warrants athorough evaluation. Many patients with under-lying psychiatric illness who are evaluated in theED do not have a complete set of vital signs documented. In particular, the temperature isfrequently not obtained. An incomplete set ofvital signs is a common pitfall. Alterations invital signs may be the only clue to an underlying medical disorder, such as bacterial meningitis,sepsis, pneumonia or other infection, or a toxidrome. Head The head should be inspected for any evidenceof trauma, including signs of a basilar skull frac-ture (Battle's sign or raccoon's lacerations. the scalp foroccult hematomas. Closely examine the head forthe presence of surgical scars or shunt hardware. Eyes The ocular examination warrants close attentionas it may be the only abnormality detected onphysical examination in a patient with an under-lying medical problem. Pinpoint pupils (miosis)can be caused by narcotics, cholinergic toxicity,brainstem lesions or clonidine should may signifyincreased intracranial pressure. Asymmetry ofthe pupils (anisocoria) may indicate a space-occupying central lesion, although this may be anormal finding. Attention should also bedirected to the extraocular movements (EOMs).Alterations in EOMs can be seen with Wernicke'sencephalopathy or brainstem lesions. The presence of nystagmus is another important fea-ture associated with drug intoxication, but maybe present in brainstem and posterior fossalesions. Neck Assess for evidence of trauma, surgical scars,masses, nuchal rigidity, bruits, or thyromegaly. Cardiopulmonary Careful inspection and auscultation for evidenceof pneumonia, murmurs, extra heart sounds,trauma or surgical scars is very important. Abdomen Distension or pain with palpation may suggestpossible underlying surgical pathology.Hepatomegaly and ascites in the setting of abnor-mal behavior may suggest hepatic encephalop-athy. A rectal examination should be performed to assess for signs of trauma, foreign body, drugsor melena/hematochezia. Genitourinary In women, a careful pelvic examination shouldbe performed to look for evidence of foreignbody, rape, trauma or infection. In older men,particularly those with diabetes, Fournier's gangrene of the scrotum and perineum or prosta-titis may cause abnormal behavior due to infection.Skin Assess skin turgor for signs of dehydration and malnutrition. Inspect for the presence of petechiae,purpura or ecchymosis. Is there evidence ofintravenous (IV) drug usage (track marks, \"skinpopping,\" abscesses or scars from previousI&Ds), burns, or excoriations. Are there lesionssuspicious for Kaposi's sarcoma that might deficiency syn-drome (AIDS) encephalopathy? Neurologic The neurologic examination is essential in differ-entiating medical from psychiatric illness. Aretrospective review of patients admitted to psy- chiatric hospitals demonstrated the neurologicexamination to be the most frequently undocu-mented portion of the physical examination. Theexamination should be performed in a systematicfashion, with assessment of orientation, memory,cranial nerves, motor, sensory, reflexes and cere-bellar function included and documented. Psychiatric Is the patient suicidal or homicidal? Determinethe patient's orientation (day, date, time andlocation), mood (emotional state), affect (flat vs.elevated), thought content (delusions), cognitivefunction (mini-mental status examination), speechquality (rapid, clear) and presence of hallucin-ations (auditory vs. visual) (Table 10.3). Another helpful mnemonic in distinguishing functional from organic disorders is OMI-HAT(Orientation, Memory, Intellect, Hallucinations,Affect, Thinking). An organic etiology is moreoften associated with alterations in the OMI,while functional disorders are more associatedwith abnormalities in HAT. The confusion assessment method (CAM) may be the most useful tool for diagnosing delir-ium. Delirium is an acute disturbance of con-sciousness with associated impaired cognition notaccounted for by pre-existing dementia. CAMidentifies the criteria necessary for diagnosis;other criteria that are not necessary for diagnosis(although common in delirium) include abnor-mal psychomotor activity, sleep-wake cycle dis-turbances, hallucinations, delusions and tremor.CAM can detect delirium even in the presence ofdementia. The diagnosis of delirium requiresboth features 1 and 2 to be present with eitherfeature 3 or 4 (Table 10.4). Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of abnormal behavioris broad, and includes medical and traumatic ill-ness, effects of medications or intoxicants, andpsychiatric disorders. Alterations in behavior canrun the gamut from minor changes in speech to florid psychosis.

There are many organic causes of behavioral changes. Frequently, these are manifestations ofan underlying medical problem. The mnemonic\"I WATCH DEATH\" is one of several proposedfor the differential diagnosis of delirium, andserves as a good reminder when evaluating apatient in the ED with acute behavioral changes (Table 10.6). Diagnostic testing As with all patients seen in the ED, diagnostic test-ing should be guided by a careful history and phys-ical examination. Patients with a prior history ofpsychiatric illness, normal vital signs and a normalphysical examination may not require diagnostictests in the ED. In a recent survey of emergencyphysicians, most felt that \"routine\" laboratory test-ing was not a necessary part of the medical screen-ing examination of psychiatric patients. However,nearly one-third of those respondents reported that\"routine\" testing is required by their local psychi-atric treatment facilities. Few studies have examined the yield of rou- tine laboratory testing as part of the medicalscreening examination of the psychiatric patient.At a large county ED, Henneman prospectivelystudied the utility of a standardized medicalevaluation of 100 alert patients 16-65 years of age,presenting with first time psychiatric symptomswithout obvious signs of intoxication or suicidal-ity. This evaluation included a complete H&P ,complete blood count (CBC), creatine phosphok-inase (CPK), electrolyte and renal panel, prothrom-bintime, calcium, drug and alcohol screening, head CT and lumbar puncture if febrile. Theyreported that 63 patients had an underlying medical condition, with H&P being positive in 33patients, CBC in 5, electrolyte and renal panel in10, CPK in 6, drug and alcohol screen in 28, headCT in 8 and lumbar puncture in 8. The authorsnoted that all infections were detected by feveror lumbar puncture. This literature sharply con-trasts the majority of literature that reports ayield for routine screening as low as 0.05%. Mostemergency physicians agree that mandatory test-ing is costly and time-consuming, and clinicallyinsignificant abnormalities may subject an other-wise medically stable patient to unnecessaryadditional testing and delays in transfer. How-ever, selected or directed diagnostic testing isalways appropriate.

Drug screens and alcohol levels arefrequently ordered on emergency patients in theevaluation of abnormal behavior. These tests canassist with the diagnosis in obtunded patients. Inaddition, the absolute value of the blood alcohollevel can be used to estimate the rate at which anintoxicated patient should sober (30-60 mg/dl/hour). Many newer recreational drugs that causeabnormal behavior, such as ecstasy, gammahydroxybutyrate (GHB), and ketamine are notdetected by routine urine drug screens. Some literature states that hypoglycemia is responsible for up to 10% of abnormal behavior seen in ED patients. Based upon these numbersand the rapidity in which treatment should berendered, immediate bedside testing of blood sugar is important for all patients who presentwith acute alterations in behavior. Screening electrocardiograms (ECGs) are gen- erally not necessary in the evaluation of abnor-mal behavior unless the patient has abnormalvital signs, symptoms or exam findings sugges-tive of acute coronary syndrome, or significantrisk factors for a cardiac event (age /H1102250 years, cocaine or stimulant use/abuse, or str ong family history). If there is a suspicion that the patient hasingested a tricyclic antidepr essant, beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker, antiarrhythmic or othermedication known to affect cardiac conduction,an ECG should be obtained and reviewed. Chest radiography is indicated in patients with cough, tachypnea, fever or hypoxia. A lowthreshold for obtaining a chest X-ray in an elderlypatient is essential, as pneumonia may presentwith abnormal behavior as its sole finding. CTscanning of the brain is reserved for patients with a headache, focal neurologic deficits, or thoseat risk for subdural hematomas (elderly, anti-coagulant use, recent falls, trauma, or dialysis). Lumbar puncture should be performed in patients suspected of having a subarachnoidhemorrhage (despite a negative head CT) or cen-tral nervous system (CNS) infection. As a rule,anyone with fever, nuchal rigidity and alteredmental status should have a lumbar puncture(LP). Patients who are immunocompromisedmay not mount a fever even in the presence offulminant meningitis; therefore, they shouldhave an LP whether or not fever is present. Mostclinicians advocate obtaining a CT scan prior tolumbar puncture in anyone who exhibits focal neurologic findings in order to assess for masses orradiologic signs of increased intracranial pressure. General treatment principles Ensure safety The primary treatment principle of any patient presenting with abnormal behavior is ensuringthe safety of the staff and the patient. The patientmust be prevented from harming him/herself orothers. As a general rule, safety measures shouldbe instituted as needed in a rapid, collaborative,rehearsed and stepwise fashion proceeding from the least to the most restrictive. The setting for obtaining the history is import- ant, especially with a potentially violent patient.The interview should be conducted in an environ-ment of privacy but not isolation. Security person-nel should be stationed outside the room in whichthe interview is being conducted. While in theroom, the examiner should always remain between the patient and the door. Ideally, the roomshould have two points of exit so that both thephysician and the patient have access to an exitshould they feel threatened. During the H&P , thephysician should act as an advocate for the patient,not an adversary. Decompress the situation byallowing the patient to feel in control, while setting limits to what is appropriate behavior.Interviewing the patient in a seated position hasbeen shown to be effective in decompressing vio-lent patients. Avoid prolonged eye contact and talkin a calm manner without being condescending. Ifat any time an examiner feels unsafe, he or sheshould leave! Rule out conditions that require immediate action Once the safety of the patient and staff has been established, the next step is to determine whetherthe altered behavior is a symptom or sign of anunderlying medical problem. Blood glucose, oxy-genation status, fever and hemodynamic com- promise should be rapidly addressed. Determine the need for emergency pyschiatric admission Every state has conditions and laws set forth to provide for the involuntary admission of a Abnormal behavior 166 Primary Complaintsmentally ill patient. The purpose of these laws allows for a patient to be held for a set period oftime (usually 72 hours) for further psychiatricevaluation and treatment if they are deemed dan-gerous to themselves, to others, or gravely dis- abled. Some states also have laws specific toalcohol or drug intoxication that make it possibleto hold a patient for evaluation and treatment. Implement physical or chemical restraint when necessary Many patients who are agitated can be \"talked down\" using a calm and soothing voice. Informthe patient that you are his or her advocate andwant to help. Speak clearly while remaining non-judgmental. Ask the patient why he is upset andwhat could be done about it. For some patients, itmay be appropriate to bargain using food ordrink to gain control of the situation. The patientcan be offered medication, either oral or par-enteral, to calm him down. If these verbal inter-ventions fail, proceed to a higher level ofintervention called a \"show of force.\" A minimumof five trained staff are needed, one to controleach extremity and one to control the head. Anadditional person serves as the leader. To begin,the security personnel gather around the leaderto promote an image of confidence. The leader tellsthe patient to calm down or he will be restrained. The patient is then given a few seconds to back down. Many patients will respond to thisdemonstration of force. If a patient remains agi-tated or combative, it is then necessary to applyphysical restraints. At the signal of the leader, theteam controls the patient's extremities and head. Caution should be exercised at all times, as violent patients are prone to kick, swing, bite, spit andscratch while being restrained. The patient istaken down in a backward motion and thenrolled over. The leader informs the patient why restraints are necessary. Restraints are then applied and the patient is properly positioned ineither a prone or recumbent orientation. Avoidplacing patients in the supine position as this isuncomfortable and increases the risk of aspiration. Physical restraints are usually only a bridge to chemical restraint. The goal of chemical restraintis rapid tranquilization. Two classes of drugs areused in the ED for chemical restraint: antipsy-chotics and anxiolytics. It is important to befamiliar with the use of these medications in the emergency setting. Cooperative patientsshould be offered oral medications as first-lineagents. Traditionally, antipsychotics (known asneurolep tics) are the preferred first-line agent for controlling the agitated or violent patient.Haloperidol (Haldol) is the most commonantipsychotic used in the ED for rapid chemicalcontrol of the agitated patient. The recom-mended adult dose is 5-10 mg IV , which is notapproved by the Food and Drug Administration(FDA) but is generally accepted as safe, or intra- muscular (IM), repeated every 15-30 minutesuntil sedation is achieved. Haloperidol is a \"low- potency\" antipsychotic. It is associated with increased risk of include tardive dyskinesia in the case of chronic use. The incidence of EPS is low andoccurs /H110211% of the time. EPS typically responds to anticholinergic medications, such as diphen-hydramine such as chlorpromazine, are associated with lower rates of EPS but have a higher inci-dence of prolonged sedation, cardiovascular tox-icity, and orthostatic hypotension, making suited for agitatedpatient. Risperidone and olanzapine are newer \"atypical\" antipsychotics that are available in anoral formulation. The FDA recently approved the atypical antipsychotic ziprasidone for IM injection to rap-idly control agitated behavior and psychoticsymptoms in patients with acute exacerbationsof schizophrenia. To date, no studies in the EDsetting have compared haloperidol and ziprasi-done. Ziprasidone has been shown to have agreater capacity to prolong the QT interval com-pared to haloperidol. Droperidol, formerly a favorite medication of many emergency physicians, has received a\"black box\" warning by the FDA due to itspotential to precipitate torsades de pointes inpatients with underlying QT prolongation. Onestudy estimates the incidence to be 4/1100. It isimportant to note that many of the antipsy-chotics can precipitate torsades. Antipsychoticsshould not be used lactatingfemales, phencyclidine overdose or anticholiner-gic-induced psychosis. Anxiolytics may be used as single-line agents (especially when drug or alcohol intoxication orwithdrawal is suspected) or as an adjunct toantipsychotics for control of the violent patient.Benzodiazepines are the anxiolytics of choice inthis situation - especially those with rapid onsetand short half-lives. Lorazepam is one mainstay Primary Complaints 167Abnormal behaviorand can be given at a dose of 1-2 mg PO/IM/IV every 30 min. Numerous studies have shown thatanxiolytics decrease the dosage requirements ofantipsychotic agents when they are used in con-junction. Patients require lower doses of medica- tion and the incidence of EPS is lower. \"HAC\" isa commonly used ED mnemonic for Haldol(5 mg), Ativan (2 mg) and Cogentin (1 mg). Thiscombination of medication can be given as a sin-gle IM injection. Care should be exercised whenusing multiple agents in elderly patients, as over-sedation is a concern. Midazolam is anothershort-acting benzodiazepine with very rapidonset of action, and has been given safely at adose of 5 mg IM. Frequent rechecks The medical and psychiatric evaluation or trans-fer of a patient often takes time to complete. It isimportant that patients with abnormal behaviorare frequently rechecked for over- or under-sedation, abnormal vital signs, seizures, emesis orrespiratory compromise. Patients who are older or those with abnormal vital signs should be moni-tored while their disposition is being established.Patients who are agitated may need additionalmedication for sedation. Patients who are physi-cally restrained should be frequently recheckedfor extremity trauma, aspiration, respiratory compromise, pressure sores and skin injury. Special patients Elderly Elderly patients who manifest behavioral changesrepresent a special population. Alterations in behavior have been reported to be more commonprecursors of physical illness than fever, pain ortachypnea. Urinary tract infections are often implicated as a cause of abnormal behavior in theelderly; thus, a low threshold should exist forobtaining a urinalysis. If the ED evaluation of anelderly patient is unrevealing, yet a concern foran underlying medical problem r emains, the patient should be admitted to a medical floor for further observation and evaluation. Pediatric In a national review by Sills, it is estimated thatthere are over 400,000 pediatric mental healthvisits annually, accounting for 1.6% of all ED visitsby individuals under 18. Unspecified neuroticstate was diagnosed in 13.1% of patients, depres-sive disorder in 12.9%, anxiety state in 11.4% andpsychosis in 10.8% of patients. Nearly 14% of thepatients were seen for suicide attempts. The WorldHealth Organization estimates that by the year2020, childhood psychiatric disorders will becomeone of the top five causes of morbidity, mortalityand disability among children. Over the past fewdecades an increasing number of children havebeen prescribed psychoactive medications. There is a higher incidence of ingestions and psychiatric illnesses in pediatric patients withabnormal behavior than adults. When a child witha psychiatric illness presents to the ED, there isoften a breakdown of the family's support system.It is important to attempt to uncover what is notworking smoothly in the home situation. Further-more, school, work, or social stressors may be evenmore challenging without a supportive homeenvironment. Suicide is currently the fourth leading cause of death in children 10-14 years of age and thethird leading cause in children 15-19 years old. Aretrospective study by Porter demonstrated that adolescents with somatic complaints were infre-quently screened for depression in the ED. EDvisits provide an opportunity to intervene inchildren at risk for major depression or suicide. Pediatric and adolescent patients requiring admission for psychiatric evaluation and treat-ment typically go to specialized facilities that dealonly with pediatric patients. There is a nationwideshortage of pediatric psychiatric beds, which oftenresults in pediatric patients experiencing extended stays in the ED. Immune compromised Patients who are immunocompromised may not demonstrate abnormal vital signs even withserious medical illness. This is frequently demon-strated in patients with AIDS. In patients with ahistory of HIV , it is important to determine thehistory of any AIDS-defining illness. The patientand any medical records should be queried forrecent lymphocyte counts. A low threshold for diagnostic testing should be maintained. Patientswith HIV are susceptible to CNS focal neurologicfindings. For this reason, any immunocompro-mised person with abnormal behavior, even if Abnormal behavior 168 Primary Complaintsafebrile, should have a CT scan of the brain as part of the medical work-up before a lumbarpuncture. Disposition Admission Patients with underlying medical problemsrequire admission to the hospital for further eval- uation and treatment. Patients with progressivedementia may no longer be safe in their currentliving situation and might benefit from a socialservices evaluation or admission. Patients inwhom underlying medical pathology cannot besafely eliminated should be admitted to a med-ical bed for further testing. Patients who are sui-cidal, homicidal or gravely disabled should beplaced on an emergency psychiatric hold, and beadmitted to a psychiatric facility for further eval-uation and treatment. Depressed patients who do not actively endorse suicidal ideation can be difficult to dis-position. One mnemonic and scoring system forthe assessment of suicide risk is SAD PERSONS(Table 10.7). Scores of /H110886 are associated with low risks of suicide, while scores /H110226 represent a higher risk of suicide and warrant hospitaliza-tion. Caution is warranted in any patient with the possibility of suicidal behavior, and liberal use of consulting psychiatric services isrecommended. Consultation Maintain an on-call list of psychiatric careproviders at your hospital who are available toevaluate and treat patients with psychiatric emer-gencies. Attempts should be made at contacting the patient's primary psychiatrist, psychologistor therapist to assist with the disposition. Whencontacting a psychiatric care provider, be certainto relay the events leading up to the ED visit, alltreatment rendered in the ED, and the status ofthe \"medical clearance.\" Transfer Depending on the hospital, patients requiringinvoluntary or voluntary psychiatric admissionmay have to be transferred to a psychiatric carefacility after the medical screening examinationhas been completed. It is important that physician-to-physician communication occurs prior totransfer, and for the staff to confirm bed avail-ability. Furthermore, it is never appropriate toallow a family member or taxi service to transfer a patient for involuntary psychiatric admission. Caution should be used for transfer arrangementsfor voluntary psychiatric admissions as well. Observation/discharge Most patients with abnormal behavior will notbe released unless they are observed for anextended period in the ED. Patients who are dis-charged should have emergency medical andpsychiatric causes of their abnormal behaviorexcluded. Family members or a responsible adult (preferably with transportation) should beinvolved in the discharge process. Patients suf-fering from mild drug ingestions or alcoholintoxication are frequently discharged from EDsafter observation. In addition, patients with a sta-ble psychiatric condition may be discharged ifthey are not suicidal (danger to self), homicidal(danger to others), or gravely disabled. In this sit-uation, speaking directly with the patient's pri-mary mental health provider is always preferred.Patients who are discharged should have intactsupport networks, a safe place to stay, and reli-able follow-up, preferably arranged prior to dis-charge. Next day appointments or contact fromthe patient's psychiatrist or therapist is mostdesirable.

Abnormal behavior 170 Primary ComplaintsPrimary Complaints 171Allergic reactions and anaphylactic syndromes Scope of the problem In the emergency department (ED), it is not uncommon to compare the pain of minor proce-dures to a \"bee sting.\" However, the estimatedprevalence of acute anaphylactic reactions toinsect stings is as high as 0.8% of the US popula-tion, resulting in about 40 deaths annually. In thebroader scheme, anaphylaxis from any cause hasbeen estimated to occur at rates as high as 1 inevery 3000 patients, with 500 deaths per year inthe US. Despite the predominantly subtle presen-tations, lethal allergic reactions do occur. Failure to rapidly diagnose and treat these conditions will likely result in untoward outcomes. Therefore,it is imperative that emer gency physicians have a solid understanding of allergic reactions andanaphylaxis. It is important to remember that the symptoms of allergic reactions occur on aspectrum - from mild cases of pruritis to cardio-vascular collapse. Pathophysiology The term \" anaphylaxis \" comes from the Greek words for \"against\" and \"protection.\" The mech-anism begins when the body producesimmunoglobulin E (IgE) during initial exposureto an antigen. On subsequent exposure, IgE bindsto mast cells, causing release of vasoactive products. These products, histamine being chiefamong them, lead it hasbeen suggested that mast cells or basophils canalso release new mediators in a delayed fashion,which results in a second phase of symptoms. Anaphylactoid reactions are syndromes that present as anaphylaxis, but not through an IgE-mediated mechanism. In addition, they often do not require a prior exposure to the antigen. From a practical perspective, however, anaphylaxisand anaphylactoid reactions are often clinicallyindistinguishable, and will therefore be as anaphylactic syndromes . Inciting causes of anaphylactic syndromes are legion, including but not limited to insect bitesand stings, food exposure, medications (especiallyby parenteral administration), latex exposure,exercise (with or without concurrent food expos-ure), seminal fluid, and idiopathic factors. History Although history is important in confirming boththe diagnosis and etiology of acute allergic syn-dromes, it is vital to remember that the length ofthe history must be proportional to the stabilityof the patient. Do you have trouble breathing or talking? As always, airway management must take top pri- ority. In allergic syndromes, airways can be com-promised by angioedema, and the sometimes briefwindow of opportunity for securing the airwaymay close rapidly. If impending airway collapse isnot quickly recognized by the emergency physi-cian, a bad outcome is almost certain to follow. Anaffirmative nod to this question requires immedi-ate transfer to a monitored area of the ED, whereairway emergencies can be adroitly handled. When did the symptoms start and how long have they been going on? The symptoms of anaphylaxis typically start within seconds to minutes of exposure to theoffending antigen; however, they may start aslate as 24 hours after exposure. In general, thesooner symptoms appear after exposure, the moresevere the clinical course. The possibility of abiphasic response, where severe symptoms recurup to 8 hours after the initial symptoms resolve(in about 20% of treated patients) has been described in the literature. Persistent anaphylac- tic reactions consist of continual symptoms for 5-32 hours despite medical therapy. Do you have any known allergies? Any new exposures? Has this happened before? Identification of the inciting antigen is notalways possible, but should be attempted in order11 Allergic reactions and anaphylactic syndromes Steven Go, MDAllergic reactions and anaphylactic syndromes 172 Primary Complaintsto discontinue exposure to that antigen (e.g., new make-up, perfum e, topical medication). Previous incidents and known allergies may provide a clueto the etiology of the current attack or point tospecific cross-reactivities that may exist (i.e., peni-cillins and ceph alosporins). Frequent previous incidents may identify carcinoid syndrome, her-editary angioedema, or factitious anaphylaxis. What were the surrounding events when thesymptoms occurred? If the symptoms occur in conjunction with the introduction of emotional stress, a vasovagalreaction may be suspected. If the symptoms begin during or shortly after a meal, a potential foodantigen is possible. Since restaurants do not generally disclose the precise ingredients in theirdishes, many patients may not realize they haveconsumed foods that they know cause themproblems. Anaphylaxis can occur in conjunctionwith vigorous exercise, especially in conditionedathletes in adverse climates. Has anyone in your family had symptoms like this before? If affirmative, hereditary angioedema should be suspected. Many antigens and exposures causedifficulty for an entire family.Associated symptoms Anaphylactic syndromes can present in variousways (Table 11.1). vascular permeabil-ity can appear as urticaria, angioedema, and issometimes preceded by a feeling of flushing andwarmth. Laryngeal edema can quickly lead toairway compromise and may present with stri-dor, hoarseness, a feeling with syncope ordizziness, which are sometimes harbingers of vas-cular collapse. Other associated symptoms includegastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as nausea,vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, whichmay sometimes be bloody. Signs and symptomsof shock may be present in severe cases. Uterinemuscle contractions can cause pelvic cramping,and in pregnancy, miscarriage. In anaphylaxis,any of these symptoms can be present, eithertogether or in isolation. Skin findings are presentin up to 90% of cases. However, the absence ofskin signs in no way rules out the presence of ananaphylactic syndrome. Past medical Patients with a history of cardiac or pulmonarydisease are at greater risk of death. Patients tak-ing /H9252-blockers who develop anaphylaxis are Table 11.1 Symptoms and signs of anaphylactic syndromes Presentation Symptoms Signs Airway edema Sensation of throat tightness, Respiratory distress, stridor, muffled voice or dysphagia, dysphonia hoarseness, coughing, sneezing, nasal congestion Angioedema Swelling without pruritis Edema: especially of face, eyelids, lips, tongue, uvula, eyes, hands, and feet Bronchospasm Dyspnea, chest tightness Wheezing, coughing, retractions, tachypneaDistributive shock Dizziness, syncope, near-syncope, Hypotension, tachycardia anxiety, weakness, confusion Gastroenteritis Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, Diffuse abdominal pain without peritoneal signs. bloating, abdominal cramping May have normal examination Increased Rhinorrhea, tingling, rash or Raised erythematous welts of various sizes on swelling, flushing the skin surface. Usually pruriticPrimary Complaints 173Allergic reactions and anaphylactic syndromesoften refractory to therapy and are at extremely high risk. Physical examination General appearance The general appearance of the patient is of crucialimportance. Patients experiencing allergic reac-tions who appear sick are probably ill or about to be very ill. Any difficulty speaking, respiratorydistress, or agitation should pr ovoke immediate treatment. An expressed fear of impending doom is often prescient. Vital signs Temperature is usually normal. Cardiovascular involvement is suggested by hypotension, tachy-cardia, and dysrhythmias. Pulse oximetry is typ-ically normal until airway compromise is nearlycomplete; therefore, a normal reading does notrule out airway involvement. Integument Inspection may reveal urticaria (Figure 11.1),angioedema, erythema, flushing, and pruritis.Diaphoresis and/or cyanosis indicates the pres-ence of shock. Head and neck Inspection may reveal swelling of the eyelids,lips (Figure 11.2), tongue, and oral mucosa. Lipor facial cyanosis indicates severe respiratorycompromise. The presence of drooling, the inabilityto manage secretions, and the size and appearanceof the uvula and tongue should all be noted. Theposterior oropharynx should be inspected forpatency. A hoarse or muffled voice signals poten tial airway compromise, as does dysphagia. Stridorshould be identified. Eye itching, conjunctivalinjection, and tearing can occur. Nasal congestion,rhinorrhea, and sneez ing may also be present. Observing the patient's Mallampati classification(Figure 2.8) may be useful in helping determinewhat type of airway stabilization method isappropriate if acute airway compromise occurs,but its role in the management of anaphylaxishas not been clearly delineated in the literature. Lungs Wheezing indicates bronchospasm if enough air-flow is present to wheeze. A quiet chest is an evenmore dangerous sign because it indicates severecompromise of the patient's ventilatory status.Increased respiratory effort is also dangerous. Heart Tachycardia is most common, but other dysrhyth- mias may be present. Abdomen Crampy abdominal pain as a result of edema,smooth muscle contraction or vascular engorge-ment can be present. However, true peritonealsigns should not be present. Tenesmus can alsooccur. Figure 11.1 Urticaria. Courtesy :Steven Shpall, MD. Figure 11.2Angioedema involving the upper lip. Courtesy :Leland Robinson, MD and Steven Go, MD.Extremities Patients with anaphylaxis commonly have a rapid, weak, thready pulse. Cyanosis of the nailbeds occurs with severe respiratory compromise. Neurologic Altered mental status, agitation, lightheaded-ness, or unconsciousness are signs of a severereaction. Seizures are uncommon, but may occur. Otherwise, the neurologic examination shouldbe normal. Differential diagnosis There are numerous entities that can mimic ana-phylaxis. It can be very difficult to differentiatethem in the acute phase. Therefore, clinical syn-dromes that appear to be anaphylaxis should betreated as anaphylaxis until proven otherwise (Table 11.2). Diagnostic testing Diagnostic testing is of little utility in the emer-gent diagnosis and management of anaphylacticsyndromes in the ED. Laboratory studies Serum histamine and tyramine levels have beenmentioned in the literature to possibly confirmthe diagnosis of anaphylaxis. However, hista-mine has an extremely short half-life; therefore, ameaningful level is difficult to measure. Moreimportantly, these tests are more appropriate toconfirm the diagnosis after the patient has beenstabilized. They should play no role in determin-ing whether to suspect anaphylaxis or to treat it. Electrocardiogram and radiologic studies Electrocardiogram (ECG) and radiologic studies are generally nonspecific. Confirmational skintesting is beyond the scope of emergency medicine. General treatment principles The guiding treatment principle is to rapidly determine that the patient needs treatment.Anaphylaxis often occurs without warning, anda delay in appropriate therapy may prove fatal.Therefore, a high level of suspicion must bemaintained. In addition, for obvious reasons,there are few prospective controlled trials for thetreatment of anaphylactic shock. Therefore, itshould be remembered that the treatment recom-mendations in the literature are largely based onanecdotal clinical experience. Although the following treatment strategies should occur simultaneously, it is help ful to con- ceptualize them in a few basic categories. Antigen removal If the inciting antigen is still present (e.g., thestinger of a bee, article of clothing), it should beremoved promptly. Epinephrine administration Epinephrine administration is the cornerstone oftreatment. It should be given when anaphylaxisis suspected. The usual dose of epinephrine is0.3-0.5 mg of 1 : 1000 solution given subcuta- neously (SC) or intramuscularly (IM). The IM route has been touted as being the more effica- cious. Some experts have even recommendedintravenous (IV) administration, but given thepotential hazards of this route (e.g., dysrhyth-mias, myocardial infarction, cerebral vascularevents, organ ischemia) and the lack of conclu-sive advantages, it is probably prudent to avoidthe IV route except in cases of cardiopulmonaryarrest. Epinephrine should be used with care inthose with known cardiac disease or pregnancy;however, as always, the benefits of the treatmentmust be weighed against its risks. Epinephrineshould be used with caution in patients on /H9252-blockers (see Special patients). Airway control The most common mistake in airway manage-ment is the failure to recognize the need for earlyairway control. For any patient with an allergicreaction, the status of the airway must be deter- mined, documented, and monitored closely. Anoral airway is preferable to a surgical airway, ifpossible. If early laryngeal edema is present, earlyelective airway control is preferable to expectantmanagement. By the time extreme respiratorydistress develops, achieving an airway may beimpossible. Rapid sequence intubation (RSI)should be used with great caution in thesepatients, as unseen lower airway edema may Allergic reactions and anaphylactic syndromes 174 Primary ComplaintsPrimary Complaints 175Allergic reactions and anaphylactic syndromesTable 11.2 Differential diagnosis of anaphylaxis-like syndromes Diagnosis Symptoms Signs Workup Carcinoid Recurrent episodes of flushing of the face Hypotension, no urticaria.

In such cases, giving paralytics would be unwise. If imme- diately available , fiberoptic intubation may be a safer option. In any event, equipment and person- nel necessary for the establishment of an emer- gent surgical rescue airway should ideally beclose at hand when managing the airway. Ventilatory support Any component of bronchospasm should betreated with bronchodilators, supplemental oxy-gen, and corticosteroids. Arterial blood gasesmay be useful in determining the level of ventila-tory compromise, although the decision to intub-ate for ventilatory compromise remains largely aclinical one. Circulatory support Fluid resuscitation with normal saline or colloidshould be given for hypotension and other signsof shock. Large quantities may be required tomaintain a satisfactory blood pressure. Centralvenous pressure monitoring may be helpful inguiding therapy. For refractory cases, vasopres-sors such as norepinephrine may be required.The patient should be kept recumbent until bloodpressure stabilizes. Secondary medications Antihistamines can be useful in treating cuta-neous manifestations of allergic reactions, butthere is debate regarding their efficacy in acuteanaphylaxis. Therefore, they should be viewedas adjunctive treatments to epinephrine and fluids in this circumstance. It has been shownthat in acute allergic urticaria, the addition of H 2- blockers to H 1-antagonists results in improved outcomes (resolution of urticaria, with or withoutangioedema) in patients compared with treatmentwith H 1-blockade alone. Corticosteroids likely have no benefit in the acute phase of anaphylaxis, given their delayedonset of action. However, they may reduce thepossibility of a biphasic reaction. Therefore, theyshould probably be given early to all patients,unless contraindications exist. Aminophylline has traditionally been thought to be useful in treating bronchospasm, stimulatingrespiratory drive, augmenting cardiac contrac- tions, and promoting diaphragmatic contractility.However, the utility of this medication in theemergency treatment of acute bronchospasm hasbeen questioned in the literature, and its useremains controversial. Norepinephrine and glucagon may be useful in refractory hypotension. Glucagon may be par-ticularly useful in hypotensive /H9252-blockers. Special patients Taking /H9252-blockers /H9252-blockers are proallergenic, and also amplify the production of anaphylactic mediators whichpotentiate the severity of allergic reactions. /H9252- blockers may also blunt the usually favorableresponse to epinephrine treatment. Glucagon may be useful in treating hypotension in anaphylaxispatients who are taking /H9252-blockers. In addition, these patients may develop severe hypertensionupon epinephrine administration, secondary tounopposed /H9251-adrenergic effects. Dysrhythmias may also occur. Adverse reactions may also occurduring epinephrine therapy in patients who are amine oxi- dase inhibitors. Epinephrine used atreduced dosages in these cases, and phentolamine (to treat hypertension) and lidocaine (to treatdysrhythmias) should be readily available. Resistant bronchospasm Resistant bronchospasm may occur in patientswho are taking /H9252-blockers. Sometimes higher than usual dosages or frequency of bronchodila-tors ( /H9252-agonists and anticholinergics) are neces- sary epinephrine maybe useful when SC epinephrine fails to relievebronchospasm. Other therapies mentioned in theliterature IV magnesium, vitamin C,naloxone, atrial natriuretic factor, and glucagon;however, evidence of benefit for these medica-tions is inconclusive. Disposition Much like treatment, disposition recommenda-tions in the literature are generally based on clin-ical experience. Patients with mild allergic reactions limited to peripheral cutaneous findings (not involving theairway) without evidence of anaphylaxis may betreated symptomatically and discharged withcareful follow-up instructions, including inciting antigen.Primary Complaints 177Allergic reactions and anaphylactic syndromesPatients with more severe reactions (e.g., mucosal swelling, wheezing), but without evidence of shock should be treated aggressively, andobserved for at least 8 hours. If the patient makesa prompt recovery without complications andremains asymptomatic, he may be safely dis- charged with cautionary discharge instructions,corticosteroids to prevent a late-phase reaction,and close follow-up. In the absence of con-traindications, patients should also be given aprescription for an epinephrine injector andinstructions on how to use it. However, the sub-set of these patients with significant pre-existingcomorbidities (e.g., advanced age, cardiopul-monary disease) should probably be admitted for observation. In addition, some experts suggestadmitting any patient who requires multiple dosesof epinephrine, regardless of response to therapy. All other patients with anaphylactic syndromes should be admitted for observation.For all discharged patients, the prevention of future allergic reactions should be stressed. Thepatient should be urged to remove inciting anti-gens from their environment. This may require aphysician's note to an employer to request thatthe patient be allowed to avoid a workplace anti-gen. In certain cases, where desensitization forunavoidable antigens may be neces sary, referral to an allergist is appropriate. Finally, the inciting antigen (if known) should be well- documented in the patient's medical record, especially if theantigen is a medication or latex. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Pitfalls Failure to recognize the subtle earlypresentation of anaphylaxis.

Failure to administer epinephrine early in thepatient's treatment. Failure to recognize the contraindications forRSI in anaphylaxis patients. Failure to anticipate difficulties in thetreatment of patients taking /H9252-blockers. Failure to observe patients for an adequatelength of time. Failure to admit high-risk patients. Failure to anticipate the possibility of abiphasic allergic reaction. Failure to appropriately administer andprescribe corticosteroids. Failure to counsel the patient to avoidantigen triggers. Failure to prescribe an epinephrine injectorfor susceptible patients and to properlyinstruct them regarding its use. Myths Patients with anaphylaxis always look sickon initial presentation. Airway compromise always follows a lineartime course. A ntihistamine agents are first-line treatments for anaphylaxis. Once patients get better, they never relapse. If the patient does not react immediately afterexposure to an antigen, they cannot have asignificant anaphylactic reaction. References 1.Bochner BS, Lichtenstein LM. Anaphylaxis.

The etiology might bechronic or acute, life-threatening or benign,reversible or irreversible. One of nearly a dozen different organ systems might be implicated orperhaps harmed by the event. The knowledge-able, diligent emergency physician will be able tonarrow the differential to a manageable numberof diagnoses within minutes and correctly treatthe majority of patients. Terminology AMS is an alteration of a patient's level of cogni- tive (knowledge-related) ability, appearance, emo-tional mood, and speech and thought patterns. Level of consciousness relates to one's level of awareness and responsiveness to his or her surroundings. Lethargy is generally referred to when one is suffering from a mild to moderate depression inlevel of consciousness. It implies an abnormalstate of drowsiness or sleepiness in which it maybe difficult to arouse the patient. Stupor is a more profound depression of one's level of consciousness. One might say thatstupor is an extreme form of lethargy requiring agreater stimulus to produce a lesser degree ofarousal. Coma is an abnormal state of deep unconscious- ness from which a patient cannot be awakened. Organic illness refers to impairment of normal anatomic and/or physiological activity resulting in impaired mental functioning . Functional illness generally refers to a physical disorder with noknown or detectable or ganic basis to explain the symptoms. Delirium is an acute confusional state with an organic etiology. The key to this definition is thatthere is an alteration in both the level and thecontent of consciousness. Unrecognized delir-ium can result in significant morbidity and mor-tality. If treated, it is reversible in the majority ofcases.Dementia is an insidious deterioration of higher cortical function with an organic etiology. In dis-tinct contrast to delirium, affected patients willhave a normal level of consciousness. Althoughacute insults and deterioration in mental statusmay be reversible, underlying dementia is rarelycompletely corrected. Acute psychosis is the functional disease that needs to be distinguished from delirium anddementia. Loss of the ability to distinguish realityfrom fantasy is the hallmark of psychosis. It canbe very difficult to distinguish an acutely psy-chotic patient from one who is delirious. Abulic state (akinetic mutism) is the inability to respond or act. For example, responsiveness may be so depressed in a patient with frontal lobe dys-function that it may take the patient several min- utes to answer a question. Locked-in syndrome from destruction of pontine motor tracts may leave the patient unable torespond, except for the ability to move the eyes in upward gaze. Psychogenic unresponsiveness is a form of func- tional, nonphysiologic unresponsiveness. Delirium vs. dementia vs. acute psychosis The emergency physician must make a concerted effort to identify patients who are deliri ous. The distinction can be difficult to make but may becritical to the ultimate well-being of the patient.The etiologies of delirium are extensive, andmany of the causes have the potential for seriousmorbidity or mortality. Distinguishing featuresbetween these three conditions are identified inTable 12.1. Anatomic essentials Arousal requires a healthy functioning reticularactivating system (RAS) and cerebral cortex. Themidbrain portion of the reticular system is the keyand may be viewed as a driving center for thehigher structures; loss of the midbrain reticularformation (MRF) produces a state in which the12 Altered mental status Barry Simon, MDand Flavia Nobay, MDAltered mental status 180 Primary Complaintscortex appears to be waiting for the command to function. This ascending midbrain reticular acti-vating system extends upward into the hypo-thalamus to the thalamus. It is stimulated byevery major somatic and sensory pathway, directlyor indirectly. Awareness and arousal also dependon the proper functioning of the cerebral cortex.Unconsciousness will result if there is severe dis-ruption of anatomic or physiologic functioning of either the MRF or both cerebral hemispheres.These critical structures may be compromised by structural, chemical or infectious etiologies.Unilateral insults to the cerebral cortex will notresult in unconsciousness unless the brainstem is also affected. History What is/was the timing and course of eventssince the onset of change in mental status or level of consciousness? Acritical distinction between dementia and delir- ium is the time course. Therefore, this is a key question for the patient and family member(s). Dementia is generally insidious in onset comparedwith delirium, which is acute and dramatic. Withrespect to acute psychosis vs. delirium, the dis- tinction is less clear. However, patients sufferingfrom a state of delirium will often have a waxingand waning course compared with the continuousnature of functional disease.What methods can the physician use to helpovercome the inability to obtain a detailed history from the patient? As with most medical problems, the quality of the history will often dictate the success and timeli-ness of the emergency department (ED) evalu-ation. One of the major inherent difficulties in theevaluation of patients with AMS is the inability toget a meaningful and reliable history from thepatient. All other sources for recent and past med-ical history must be tapped: paramedics, relatives,friends, medic alert tag, wallet, personal phys- ician, hospital records, pill bottles, etc. Socialservices support may be critical in the search forinformation about these patients. In addition torecent history, the importance of obtaining past medical history (including suicidal ideation/sui-cide attempts), current medications and social his-tory (substance abuse) cannot be overemphasized. Physical examination Vital signs Athorough physical examination along with rapid bedside tests may be more enlighteningthan with many other problems that present tothe ED. The five vital signs may offer a numberof important clues. The respiratory rate and pat-tern may suggest an intracranial pathology or anacid-base disorder. The heart rate, rhythm, andelectrocardiogram (ECG) findings can offer aDelirium Dementia Acute psychosis Definition Acute confusional state Insidious deterioration Loss of the ability to distinguish in higher cortical functions reality from imaginary Organic vs. functional Organic disease Organic disease Functional disease Onset/course Hours to days Months Hours to days Fluctuating course Progressive course Stable course Level of consciousness Altered Normal NormalHallucinations Visual - common None Auditory - commonOrientation Altered Altered NormalVital signs Widely variable Normal Variable and fluctuating Miscellaneous Extreme agitation is Consider medications, thyroid Fixed delusions common disease and infections as a First attack common in Reversible in /H1102280% cause for exacerbations patients /H1102140 years oldTable 12.1 Delirium vs. dementia vs. acute psychosisPrimary statusnumber antidepressants beta blockers), metabolicderangements (high or low calcium or potassium)or closed head injury with deep inverted T waves.An elevated temperature can lead one to an infec-tious etiology or, if pathologically high ( /H11091106 \u00baF), may suggest heat stroke or an intracranial process.Elevated blood pressure, a widened pulse pressure(systolic minus diastolic pressure) and slow heartrate (Cushing reflex) may be consistent with elevated intracranial pressure. Pulse oximetry maydirect the practitioner to focus on causes of hypoxiaand whether or not low oxygenation relates to thepatient's overall presentation. Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat There are a number of components of the generalphysical examination that are particularly helpful.Breath odor can quickly clue one to the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), liver failure (fetorhepaticus) or a number of toxins, such as alcohol,insecticides (onion odor), paint or glue, gasoline,cyanide (bitter almonds) and arsenic (garlic). Thehead needs to be examined for signs of acute orrecent trauma (hemotympanum, cephalohe- matoma, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak, Battle'ssign, raccoon eyes) and for past surgery (shunt,cranial defect). Eyes The pupillary exam is an essential part of the physical examination, as it can provide informa-tion about structural and metabolic abnormali-ties. One must look for pupillary size and thepresence of asymmetry. Examining the directand consensual response to light will determinethe integrity of the afferent function of the opticnerve. A unilateral dilated pupil in an alteredpatient is secondary to herniation until provenotherwise (Figure 12.1). The mass causing thepathology is usually on the same side as thedilated pupil, as demonstrated in the figure. Inthe awake, alert patient, the only life-threateningcause for a unilateral dilated pupil is compres-sion of cranial nerve III by a mass such as a posterior communicating aneurysm. There are anumber of other causes for pupillary dilationthat are not serious (traumatic mydriasis, inten-tional or accidental topical medications, Adie'spupil, anisicoria). Bilateral may represent an opiate over-dose or pontine lesion. (a) (b) Figure 12.1 (a) Photograph of patient with transtentorial herniationfrom blunt head trauma. The right pupil is constrictednormally; the patient's left pupil is fixed and dilated.(b) Illustration of an epidural hematoma with acute mass effect and compression of the ipsilateral cerebral peduncle resulting in uncal herniation.Reproduced from D. Mandavia et al, Color Atlas of Emergency Trauma , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2003.The fundoscopic examination is a critical, often underutilized component of the eye examination. Flame hemorrhages are characteristic of hyper-tensive bleeds. Increased intracranial pressure willproduce changes associated with papilledema(Figure 12.2), in which the disc margins of theoptic nerve are not sharp. Early, more subtle find-ings of increased intracranial pressure includeabsent venous pulsations, although this is notspecific. Eventually, the findings will includeblurred disc margins and engorged vessels.Fundoscopic changes associated with diabetes(neovascularization, exudates) orwith methanol ingestion (optic disc hyperemiaand retinal edema) may provide clues to the causeof the patient's altered level of consciousness. Eye movements are generally more helpful than commonly thought. Assuming the brainstem isintact, most comatose patients exhibit slowlyroving eye movements. In contrast, malingering or hysterical patients feigning coma have sponta-neous eye movements that tend to be rapid andrigid. It is important to note that if both eyescross midline, the brainstem is intact. When theeyes are fixed in one direction, commonly theywill \"look\" toward the side of a hemorrhage oraway from a destructive lesion. Eyelid tone may help to differentiate organic disease from hysteria. Hysterical patients mayoffer some resistance to the examiner's attemptto open the eyes. They tend to close the lidsquickly. \"Fluttering\" eyelids are commonly seenin patients who are feigning unresponsiveness.Patients with organic coma offer no resis tance to lid opening, and then close the lids slowly and incompletely. Unilateral ptosis may be seen in patients with a third cranial nerve palsy or when there is disruption of the sympathetic chain inassociation with a Horner's syndrome . The oculocephalic reflex (doll's eyes) (Figure 12.3) depends upon the medial longitudinal fasciculus(MLF), which receives constant input about thepatient's head position from the semicircularcanals. Without cortical input, the eyes are typ-ically directed straight ahead and remain fixed inthe orbit as the head is turned. The oculocephalicreflex is elicited by rotating the head briskly from side to side. If the brainstem is intact, the eyesdeviate opposite to the direction of the rotationof the head (head rotated right, eyes deviate left).Confusion often arises because the patient's eyescontinue to look straight ahead. In other words,they remain focused in the same direction, possi- bly giving one the impression that they did notmove. The examiner needs to remember that in order for the eyes to remain fixed in a given direc-tion when the head is turned, the eyes had to move. Cervical spine injury must be excludedbefore performing this maneuver. Oculovestibular testing (cold calorics) (Figure 12.4) is another underutilized ED maneuver whichcan yield important clinical information aboutthe integrity of the brain and the brainstem. Thetest is performed by positioning the patient supinewith the head elevated 30\u00b0 in order to isolate theinput of the horizontal semicircular canals.10-20 cc of ice-cold water or saline are injectedinto the auditory canal. Cooling of the mastoidbone causes alteration in endolymphatic flow Altered mental status 182 Primary Complaints (a) (b) Figure 12.2 (a) Early papilledema with disc elevation, blurring of themargins, hyperemia, and venous engorgement in theright eye.

If the practitioner always uses cold water and remembers three points described in Table 12.2 and Figure 12.4, the examination can be extremelyhelpful. Neck The neck must be examined for the presence ofnuchal rigidity (meningismus) that often occurswhen the meninges become inflamed by bloodor infection. Thyroid or parathyroid disease maybe the cause for an alteration in mental status orlevel of consciousness. The neck should be exam-ined for an enlarged thyroid or the presence of asurgical scar suggesting previous thyroid orparathyroid surgery. Pulmonary Hypoxia and hypercarbia are uncommon causesof an altered level of consciousness. However,findings consistent with severe lung disease andrespiratory distress should raise consideration for these entities. One must look for the barrel chest of the patient with emphysema, wheezingand a prolonged expiratory phase in patientswith obstructive lung disease, and for evidenceof consolidation in those with pneumonia. Cardiac The cardiovascular system is rarely the primarysource for mental status changes. Yet dysrhyth mias,valvular heart disease and severe heart failurecan be implicated. The heart should be examinedfor the presence of an irregular rhythm and forextra heart sounds including an S3, murmursand/or rubs. Abdomen Athorough abdominal examination should be performed to look for signs of infection,organomegaly, mass or obstruction. Any cause ofabdominal infection can lead to an alteration in consciousness, especially in elderly patients.Localized tenderness, absent bowel sounds,rebound tenderness and rigidity are all signs of a serious intra-abdominal infection. Liver failure isa common cause of altered consciousness. Anenlarged liver or a small, hard nodular liver maybe noted during examination. Late findings ofcatastrophic abdominal processes such as pan-creatitis and ecchymosis (Grey Rectal Rectal examination may identify a mass sug-gestive of a malignancy or melena associated withan upper gastrointestinal bleed. Skin The skin is an often underappreciated componentof the physical examination. Signs of local or sys-temic disease may be found. Skin temperature andstate of hydration offer clues about infection, bloodsugar (moist with low glucose and dry with ele-vated blood glucose) and some toxins (cholinergicand anticholinergic agents). angiomas, palmar be present in patients with long-term liverdisease. Hypothyroid patients will often developcoarse dry hair, thinning of the lateral aspect of theeyebrows and dry, rough, pale skin. Needle tracks,petechiae and other rashes may often be signifi-cant clues of underlying disease processes. Neurologic The neurologic examination for patients withAMS must be thorough. This part of the exami-nation begins with observation.

The keyis to recognize an abnormal respiratory pattern,not remembering the exact level of the brainstemthat may be implicated. Body posture is alsoimportant, and will be discussed in the section onthe motor examination. Mental status assessment Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) :This is a fifteen point scale developed to assess head-injured patients; however, it is commonly used to communicate themental status of a patient or compare the mentalstatus of a patient at different periods of time. Thelowest score you can receive is three. The score iscalculated by assigning the number associatedwith the patient's best response (Table 12.4).AVPU : This simplified 4-part scale is used to describe the patient's level of consciousness(Table 12.5). Orientation assessment : Person, place and time. Memory :Test short-term memory by asking the patient to remember three common objects and recall them 3 minutes later. Specific mental status examinations : Two tests have been developed and studied to assist non-psychiatrists in the evaluation of mental status.Both tests are easy to perform and are accuratewith a high degree of interobserver reliability.The mini-mental status examination (MMSE) isan excellent test, but is geared mostly toward theevaluation of dementia and content of thinking.The best bedside test looking for the presence ofdelirium is the confusion assessment method(CAM). The astute physician will perform the CAM while observing the patient's responses during thehistory and physical examination.

Typical maneuvers used in theED include forcefully grinding the knuckles of one'sfist into the sternum or squeezing two toes togetherwhile a firm object is wedged between them) UUnresponsiveTable 12.5 AVPUcomplete the assessment. The patient is considered delirious if he or she has an acute onset illness with a fluctuating course, disorganized thinking oraltered level of consciousness, and easy dis-tractability. Being easily distracted refers to thepatient who interrupts the history and physicalexamination by striking up a conversation withother patients or health care providers, or bychanging the focus to items on the walls, etc. Thepatient with disorganized thinking will communi-cate with disconnected sentences or will changetopics from moment to moment, making it difficultor impossible to follow the line of thinking. CAM : To diagnose delirium: 1.Acute onset with a fluctuating course and 2.Easily distracted, inattentive And 3.Altered level of consciousness or 4.Disorganized thinking. Apositive test includes numbers 1 AND 2 plus number 3 OR 4. Cranial nerves (CNs) must be tested as part of a thorough neurologic examination. Portions ofthis examination were completed during theevaluation of the eye. The other CNs must betested to complete the examination and helplocalize any lesions that may be present. Motor/sensory testing is performed to look at tone, focality, and for signs of herniation. Deter-mining the extent or severity of alteration of con-sciousness is aided by evaluating motor responsesto verbal and painful stimuli. Purposeful move-ments indicate a functioning brainstem and cere-bral cortex. Posturing may be apparent in thepresence of a diffuse metabolic or toxic insult orsecondary to herniation. Decorticate arms and hyperextension of legs), decere- brate posturing (arms and legs extended and internally rotated), or both may occur as hernia-tion progresses, or both may occur as herniationprogresses. Assessment of motor tone may behelpful by suggesting an acute cardiovascularaccident (CVA) or cord injury if tone is absent.Focality identified on the motor or sensory exam-ination may help identify the level of a cord lesionor confirm that the insult is in the brain. Tonemay be increased by the presence of various tox-ins or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).Keep in mind that severe hypothermia, massiveoverdose of sedatives or hypnotics, hypoglycemiaand the postictal state can mimic structural neu-rological diseases.Reflexes may be helpful to localize the level of lesion or to place the insult in the central or theperipheral nervous system. Symmetry of respon-siveness is the key to assessment of deep tendonreflexes. The plantar (Babinski) reflex becomes abnormal in many patients with upper motorneuron pathology, especially related to the corti-cospinal tracts. The response is abnormal if thebig toe dorsiflexes and the other toes fan out-ward. This response is also significant if it is pre-sent and asymmetric. Differential diagnosis During the evaluation of patients with AMS, theprocess of generating and eliminating diagnosticpossibilities evolves. The diagnostic possibilitiesare so numerous and broad that even experi-enced practitioners need to be organized andsystematic in their approach. It is imperative to develop a process that works for you and to use it rou-tinely . Many physicians like to use mnemonics to help them focus the broad differential. Onecommonly-used mnemonic for the altered patientis AEIOU TIPS (Table 12.6). Start from the headand progress down the body, considering diag-nostic possibilities that may be associated witheach anatomic part and system as they are encoun-tered.The head-to-toe approach is intuitive, sim- ple to remember and apply, and is nearly 100%inclusive (Table 12.7). Altered mental status 186 Primary ComplaintsTable 12.6 Mnemonic for ALOC differential diagnosis Laboratory and radiographic testing of unstable, critically-ill or confused patients comes in twoforms. The first group of helpful tests are thosethat can be completed in 10 minutes or less. Thevast majority of patients presenting with AMS canhave a presumptive diagnosis made by the timethe history, physical examination, and rapid testsare complete. The following tests yield a tremen-dous amount of useful information, are inexpen-sive and can be completed in less than 10 minutes.They are not arranged in any 7.ECG - monitor (electrolyte abnormalities,toxins, acute cardiac disease). Other tests to consider: 1.Complete blood count, electrolytes (particularly important is the sodium),blood nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr),serum osmolality, calcium tomography (CT): done before lumbar puncture (LP) to ruleout focal lesions and hemorrhage.

General treatment principles As with all ED patients, treatment begins with the airway, breathing and circulation (ABCs). Themain goals of treatment are physiologic stabiliza-tion, symptom relief and specific diagnosis-driventreatment plans. The first four recommendationsare commonly referred to by the acronym DON'T (dextrose, oxygen, naloxone and thiamine). Dextrose Dextrose should be administered if glucose test- ing indicates hypoglycemia. Glucometers arevery reliable and rarely miss true hypoglycemia.One ampule of D50 (25 gm of glucose) will raisethe serum glucose by about 130 mg/dl (the rangeis from 30-300 mg/dl). Administer 50 ml in adults, 4 ml/kg 25%dextrose (0.5-1.0 in children and 5 ml/kg10% dextrose (0.5 g/kg) IV in neonates. Oxygen Oxygen levels should be checked on all patients with AMS. This can be obtained on most patientsby pulse oximetry. Supplemental oxygenation vianasal cannula or face mask with oxygen saturations lessthan 92%. Naloxone Naloxone is relatively benign and should be con- sidered in all hypoventilating, altered patientswith evidence of opioid ingestion. is along-acting narcotic antagonist. Its role in the EDis limited because of the risk of sending patientshome who may have ingested longer-acting nar-cotics; these patients may decompensate after dis-charge. The standard dose of naloxone is 2 mg IVin adults and 0.1 mg/kg IV in children. One canpartially reverse the effects of a narcotic ingestionwith small aliquots of naloxone in the range of 0.1to 0.4 mg IV . In contrast, the ingestion of some ofthe synthetic opioids and combination medica-tions, such as diphenoxylate/atropine, methadone,propoxyphene, and pentazocine may require asmuch as 10 mg of naloxone to reverse. Thiamine Thiamine administration should be considered in all patients with altered consciousness unlessthe cause is known. Thiamine is a safe, effectiveand inexpensive treatment for Wernicke'sencephalopathy. This thiamine depletion- induced encephalopathy is characterized by the abrupt onset of oculomotor disturbances, ataxia and con- fusion. If not treated promptly, it may progress toirreversible Korsakoff's psychosis (confabula-tion, retrograde amnesia, and impaired ability to learn). Although Wernicke's encephalopathy israre, it is reversible if r ecognized and treated early. Physicians must remember that alcoholismis not the only cause of thiamine deficiency.Patients are at risk for Wernicke's if they haveany cause of malnutrition or vitamin deficiency.Causes include hyperalimentation, anorexia,bulimia, pregnancy and malignancy. Adminster100 mg IV in adults and 10-25 mg IV in children. Volume repletion Many altered patients are dehydrated because ofprolonged agitation and excessive stimulationover hours to days. Care must be taken as diseasessuch as renal failure or water intoxication mayproduce delirium in volume-overloaded patients. Temperature control Fever may be a manifestation of a disease process,and can contribute to ongoing cell damage.Whether fever is secondary to heat stroke, sepsis,aspirin toxicity or drug overdose, it should betreated with appropriate interventions. One mayuse ibuprofen or acetaminophen, cooling blan-kets, wet sheets with a fan, or ice packs in the axillae or groin to reduce temperature elevations. Flumazenil Flumazenil is a competitive benzodiazepineantagonist. Independently, the drug is benign. Itsuse is limited in emergency medicine practicebecause blocking benzodiazepines from theirreceptor sites can unmask epileptogenic potential. Patients addicted to benzodiazepines may seizefrom this pharmacologically-induced withdrawal Altered mental status 188 Primary Complaintsstate. Patients who ingested drugs or medications that can cause seizures along with benzodi-azepines may seize once the \"protective\" effect ofthe benzodiazepines has been removed. Yetflumazenil may serve a diagnostic and therapeuticrole in selected cases. Administration of flumaze- nil may awaken patients who may have ingestedbenzodiazepines, preventing unnecessary endo-tracheal intubation. It may also eliminate theneed for expensive testing and possible admis-sion. The risk of causing seizures may be amelio-rated by titrating the dose of flumazenil; usingthe smallest dose recommended in incrementsmay decrease the chance of seizure. One shouldnot eliminate flumazenil from the arsenal of crit-ical care medications solely based on the risk ofseizures. As with all medications, the risks andbenefits must be carefully considered before itsadministration. The dose of flumazenil is0.2-1.0 mg IV in adults. Physostigmine Physostigmine is a cholinergic drug that can diag-nose and treat overdoses of anticholinergic sub-stances and agents with anticholinergic-likeproperties. The goal physostigmine is to reverse the patient's anticholinergic signsand symptoms. Physostigmine is administeredIV in small 0.5 mg aliquots up to a maximumtotal of 2.0 mg. End points of administrationinclude clear reversal of anticholinergic signsand symptoms, the development of cholinergicsymptoms (salivation, lacrimation, emesis), or delivery of 2.0 mg ofdrug. Physostigmine must be used with greatcaution; many centers do not use this drug at all. When administered to patients who have co-ingested agents that cause myocardial depres-sion (such as tricyclic antidepressants), the resultcan be cardiac standstill. If used, the dose ofphysostigmine is 0.5-2.0 mg IV in adults. Antibiotics Antibiotics are indicated in patients with a sus-pected infectious cause for their AMS. When considered, these drugs should be administeredearly in the ED course, often before a source of infection is clearly identified. Infections impli-cated include the urinary tract, lungs, skin, genitalia, or meninges. The choice and dose ofantibiotic must be directed by the organisms sus-pected. Blood and urine cultures should beobtained prior to the administration of antibiotics.However, in suspected meningitis, it is recom-mended that antibiotics be administered immedi-ately before performing the LP . Others The myriad of possible etiologies for AMS pre-clude a discussion of all the possible treatments.The potential exists to prepare the patient forneurosurgery, to treat significant metabolic abnor-malities, begin tr eating thyroid dysfunction, or to support the patient until drugs are metabolizedor the postictal period passes. Specific antidotesand treatment for drug ingestions are discussedin greater detail in Chapter 36. Special patients Geriatric The geriatric population is at special risk foralterations of mentation for a myriad of reasons.Some studies indicated that 40% of all geriatricpatients over 70 years have some degree of AMS.Of these, approximately 25% had alterations intheir level of consciousness, 25% had deliriumand 50% had cognitive impairment. The mostcommon cause of AMS was multifactorial, fol-lowed by medication (22-39% of all cases), infec-tion, metabolic disturbance (such as diabetesmellitus), trauma, neoplasm, cardiovascular dis-ease, pain, and dehydration/nutritional abnor-malities. Not surprisingly, in addition to thepredisposition of being altered for a givenphysiological alteration, elderly patients hadgreater morbidity and mortality compared toyounger populations. Acute confusional statesare more likely to herald an infectious process inthe elderly than the classic symptoms of fever,pain and tachycardia seen commonly in youngerpatients. Pediatric In contrast to the elderly, children and infantswith AMS usually present with treatable causesthat often lead to favorable outcomes. The mostcommon cause of the altered pediatric patient istoxicologic in nature. The critical factors in pedi-atric patients are early detection and prompttreatment with gut decontamination and anti-dotes. Other causes of coma in children includeinfections, trauma, metabolic derangements andchild abuse. Complications unique to pediatrics Primary Complaints 189Altered mental statusneed to be recognized and anticipated. For example, unlike in adults, hypoglycemia and meta-bolic derangements are commonly seen following beta-blocker ingestions, exposure to alcohols andperfumes. Failure to consider the unique causes ofhypoglycemia in children could lead the providerdown the wrong treatment algorithm. Immune compromised The immunocompromised altered patient can bea medical quagmire. This patient populationincludes those with malignancies, immunosup-pressive therapies, and immunocompromisingdiseases such as acquired immune deficiencysyndrome (AIDS). Not only are these patients atrisk for greater complications of any given dis-ease, but they also are at risk for pathology notseen in the usual clinical setting. For instance,toxoplasmosis in the HIV+ patient is a seriouscondition that may present with subtle findings,making it difficult to diagnose. Other centralnervous system (CNS) diseases and organismsthat threaten this patient population, commonlycausing altered levels of is important to remember thatsignificant chronic illness and IV drug use alsopredispose individuals to opportunistic infections.History taking must include meticulous attentionto medication lists - both prescribed and over thecounter, recent changes in diet (increased proteinin renal dialysis patients) and environmentalexposures, as these are critical in the evaluationof the altered immunocompromised patient. Disposition Altered mental status is a medical emergency.Most patients have reversible causes for theiraltered state and will clear their sensorium - usually from the metabolism of substances suchas alcohol, recreational drugs, prescription medi-cations or by recovery from their postictal state.However, physicians must be meticulous because a small but significant number of patients canprogress to coma or death unless rapid evalu-ation and treatment are successful. Despite therisk of significant morbidity and mortality, themajority of young patients have a benign causefor their condition and will eventually be dis-charged from the ED following an extendedperiod of observation.Patients who present with an altered sensor- ium as the result of an intentional ingestion willneed acute psychiatric evaluation once they havebeen medically stabilized and cleared of anytoxic side effects, such as dysrhythmias, hypo-glycemia, or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. These patients will also need to be stabilized with regardto their coexisting medical conditions. Diabeticsoften present to the ED with hypoglycemia. Inmost cases, the cause is related to a change indiet, dietary noncompliance, a change in activityor inadvertent medication error. Once infectiouscauses of their glucose disturbance have beenruled out, these patients may be safely dis- charged home after treatment and education,preferably with a friend or family member whocan offer assistance. Patients with hypoglycemiasecondary to long-acting oral agents must beadmitted to the hospital for further observationand treatment. Elderly and immunocompomised patients are far more complex and often require hospitaliza-tion regardless of the ultimate cause of theirAMS. It is not unusual for this population toexperience a persistent decline in their baselinelevel of functioning with a loss of at least oneactivity of daily living. Not surprisingly, elderlyhospitalized patients have longer hospital stays,higher mortality rates, and increased rates ofinstitutional care after hospitalization. Patientswith underlying dementia often suffer signifi-cant deterio ration in their sensorium despite seemingly minor medical insults. Hospitalization is often required to deal with the social as well asmedical concerns in this patient population. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths The clinical arena that includes altered states ofconsciousness is complex and high-risk. Thereare many pitfalls, but with meticulous evalu-ation, most can be avoided. The first critical branch point is to recognize the importance of distinguishing deliriumfrom dementia and psychosis. Travelingdown the wrong path at this juncture canresult in harm to the patient. Recognize the difficulty obtaining a qualityhistory. Do not lose sight of the importance ofthat history, and aggressively overcome anyobstacles to obtaining it. Consider the enormous differential withoutnarrowing the possibilities too early. Altered mental status 190 Primary ComplaintsRemember the basics: DON'T, hydration, temperature control, and a thorough physicalexamination that includes the eyes, the skin,breath odor and mental status examinationutilizing the CAM. An awake, alert patient with a unilateraldilated pupil has a posterior communicatinganeurysm until proven otherwise. The intracranial mass is on the same side asthe dilated pupil in about 85% of cases. The largest organ in the body, the skin, isoften overlooked when considering causesfor AMS. Patients with delirium have a 15% mortality,but the causes are reversible 80% of the time. References 1.Clinical policy for the initial approach topatients presenting with AMS.

Primary Complaints 191Altered mental statusPrimary Complaints 193Chest pain Scope of the problem Acute chest pain is the presenting complaint in roughly 3% of emergency department (ED) patients. The diagnostic possibilities range fromthe immediately life-threatening (myocardialinfarction (MI), to the unusual (herpes zoster). Althoughthe etiology of the chest pain may remain uniden-tified in a significant proportion of patients, whichcan be frustrating to both the patient and provider,it is imperative that the clinician recognizes andtreats life-threatening causes. Anatomic essentials When considering the differential diagnosis ofthe patient with chest pain, it is helpful to con-sider the five organ systems in the thorax: cardiac(heart and musculoskeletal (chest wall). Visceral pain from internal structures such as the heart, lungs, esophagus, and aorta may be difficult forthe patient to define. Pain may be described as adiscomfort or strange sensation, and it is oftenchallenging for the patient to discern an exactlocation. Somatic pain , from chest wall structures, is often more localizable and easier for the patientto characterize. Pain may be sharp or stabbing,brought on by movement or position, and canoften be pinpointed. Referred pain , from irritation or inflammation of the upper abdominal contents,may be perceived as pain in the chest or upperback. A differential diagnosis based on thesestructures is given in Table 13.1. History Acareful and focused history may uncover important clues to the etiology of chest pain. Toavoid a common pitfall, ask open-ended ques-tions when possible. \"Why did you come to theemergency department today?\" may yield moreinitial information than \"How often do you getthis chest pain?\" Additionally, ask about chest dis-comfort rather than pain, since a patient may denypain and admit only to chest pressure. Themnemonic LMNOPQRST (location, medical his-tory, new, other symptoms, provoking/palliative,quality, radiation, severity, timing) may be helpfulin obtaining a complete history. Whether or notyou use this mnemonic, it is important to obtain apicture of the patient's symptoms which includesthe following aspects:13 Chest pain Jeffrey A. Tabas, MDand Susan B. Promes, MD Table 13.1 Differential diagnosis of chest pain Heart fractureMuscle strain or tearChest pain 194 Primary ComplaintsLocation The location of pain may help define the abnor- mality. If a patient can point to a specific spot thatis extremely tender to palpation and worsens withposition change, this may be consistent with amusculoskeletal etiology. As mentioned previ-ously, visceral pain may be difficult to localize. Medical history While classic risk factors for coronary artery dis-ease have not been shown to be predictive in theacute setting, many clini cians extrapolate their importance from studies of long-term atheroscle- rotic disease. These include hypertension, smok- ing, diabetes, increased cholesterol, obesity, and family history of premature heart disease. Cocaineuse is a risk factor for both cardiac ischemia andaortic dissection. A history of rheumatic fever ora murmur can suggest valvular disease. Patientswith a history of cerebral or peripheral vasculardisease or coronary artery disease (CAD) are atrisk for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Patientswith a history of hypertension or Marfan's diseaseare at risk for aortic dissection. Patients withvomiting or a recent esophageal procedure maybe at risk for esophageal perforation. A heavy smoking history suggests underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Risk fac-tors for PE include recent surgery, family history,cancer, and estrogen use or pregnancy. Patientswith PE have no identifiable risk factor in 20% ofcases. New It is important to discover whether the patienthas had similar episodes of chest pain in the past,if they have been of similar severity, and what medical diagnosis and treatment, if any, theyreceived. A history of multiple similar episodes of pain associated with previous COPD exa-cerbations is an important clue that this may beanother similar exacerbation. Other (associated) symptoms Nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, syncope,near-syncope, and palpitations may increase theclinician's sus picion for serious illness, such as cardiac ischemia or dysrhythmia. Shortness of breath, pr oductive cough, and fever may suggest a respiratory infection. Any neurologic deficit inthe setting of pain should immediately suggestaortic dissection. Provoking/Palliative Pain that is worse with a deep breath is termedpleuritic. Pleuritic pain is associated with pul-monary etiologies such as pneumonia, pulmonaryembolus, or COPD exacerbation. Pain that is worselying flat and improves sitting up suggests peri- carditis. Chest discomfort due to angina may be associated with exertion and often improves with rest or nitroglycerin (NTG). Burning pain that is associated with meals may suggest a gastro-intestinal (GI) etiology. Quality Chest discomfort may be described in numerousways, such as sharp, burning, stabbing, pinching, squeezing, heaviness, or pressure. It is importantto begin with open-ended questions, such as \"tellme about this discomfort in your chest,\" ratherthan \"how long have you had this chest pain?\" If a patient cannot provide a description of the char-acter, you can use prompts such as \"is it sharp, burning, stabbing, heavy, squeezing or pinching?\" Pressure, heavy or squeezing pain is often con-sistent with cardiac ischemia. Sharp or stabbingpain suggests a non-cardiac cause, although car-diac ischemia can present in a multitude of ways.Apatient's demonstration of pain by a clenched fist against his or her chest is termed Levine's sign . One small study showed a high correlation withthis description and acute cardiac ischemia. Radiation Radiation of pain to the neck, jaw, shoulder, or armis often consistent with cardiac ischemia. Painthat radiates to the back may be associated withaortic dissection. Severity \"On a scale of 0 to 10, how severe is the pain?\"Severe chest pain should always raise concernfor a life-threatening emergency. A 0-10 scalemay be used to rate the pain. A rating of 1 isalmost undetectable, while a rating of 10 is theworst pain ever experienced. Severity of pain isnot predictive of disease, but should be followedover time to document the effect of interventions.The goal of the practitioner is to relieve pain asPrimary Complaints 195Chest painrapidly as possible, especially in a patient with a high suspicion of acute cardiac ischemia. Timing (duration and onset) \"How long have you had this discomfort? Is itconstant, waxing/waning, or intermittent?\" Painlasting seconds or more than 24 hours is less likelyto be cardiac in origin. However, use caution whenquestioning about symptom duration. Discomfortthat has been intermittent for several days andrecently became severe differs from pain that has remained constant for the last 72 hours. Be certain to ask questions about today's episode of pain,distinguishing it from previous episodes. \"Do youget this pain with exertion?\" would receive a dif-ferent response depending on whether you arereferring to prior anginal type pain or today's nonexertional chest pain due to acute MI (AMI).Sudden or abrupt onset of chest pain may indicatea serious underlying disorder, such as MI, PE, oraortic dissection. Physical examination The physical examination in patients with chestpain may be unrevealing. However, a thoroughexamination is essential to identify importantdiagnostic clues if present. General appearance The general appearance of a patient is an import-ant clinical observation. Patients who appearmarkedly uncomfortable or present with pallor,diaphoresis, or respiratory distress should beconsidered acutely ill. Evaluation and treatmentshould proceed in parallel rather than sequentially. Vital signs Vital signs are vital, and should be verified. Hypotension suggests shock or impending shock,and may be due to decreased cardiac output,intravascular volume depletion, or sepsis. Noteany difference in blood pressure between arms,or between arms and legs. This may suggest aor-tic dissection. Tachycardia may suggest systemicillness, dysrhythmia, or pain. In addition toreviewing the recorded vital signs, observe the patient's respiratory pattern and rate. Abnormalrespirations may be a clue to a pneumothorax, congestive heart failure (CHF), PE, COPD exacer- bation, or pulmonary abnormalities. may suggest an infectious process.Think of pulse oximetry as the \"fifth vital sign,\"and measure it in all patients with chest pain. Alow measurement may suggest a pulmonary dis-order or poor perfusion from a cardiac or vascularevent, especially if it is decreased from thepatient's baseline. Pulsus paradoxus is a loss of the pulse during inspiration. It represents the fall in systolic pres-sure from expiration to inspiration that can be feltor auscultated. As the cuff is slowly deflated, notethat pressure at which any pulse is first detected,and then the pressure at which every beat isdetected. Normally, the fall in systolic arterial pres-sure is less than 10 mmHg during inspiration.Presence of a \"pulsus\" classically suggests cardiactamponade, although it may also be present in pul-monary conditions such as emphysema or asthma. Skin Note the degree of perfusion, pallor, or diaphor-esis. Visual examination of the chest may iden-tify the cause for the pain, such as contusion orecchymosis suggesting traumatic injury, or vesic-ular rash suggesting herpes zoster. Pulmonary Inspection of the chest and surrounding struc-tures may reveal increased respiratory effort oraccessory muscle use. Auscultation may revealnormal, abnormal, or diminished breath sounds.Bilaterally decreased breath sounds with poor airmovement suggest severe reactive airway diseaseor emphysema. Unilaterally decreased breathsounds consolidation, pneumothorax, orpleural effusion. If there are decreased breathsounds unilaterally, the position of the tracheashould be examined for signs of tracheal devi-ation consolidation.Increased inspiratory to expiratory (I : E) ratioshould be noted (normal is 2 : 1). A prolongation ofthe expiratory phase suggests significant obstruc-tive airway disease. Adventitial sounds such aswheezes suggest reactive airway disease. Ralesor crackles may be consistent with atelectasis,infiltrate, or edema. The location and extent ofthese should be documented (e.g., one-third ofthe way up bilaterally, or right lower lung field).\"Velcro-like\" rales are consistent with chronicinterstitial fibrosis. Percussion may be useful for localizing dullness, suggesting infiltrate,mass, or fluid, or hyperresonance, suggestive of pneumothorax. Palpation of the chest wall may behelpful to identify crepitus, or to localize tender-ness when a musculoskeletal source is suspected. Cardiac Inspection of the chest may reveal previous sur-gical scars, implanted devices such as pacemakersor cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), and hyper-dynamic states. Palpation should loca-tion and quality of the left ventricular systolicimpulse. Normal location of this impulse is in thefifth intercostal space at the mid-clavicular line.Placing the fingers of the right hand at the leftsternal border in each rib space allows appreci-ation of a right-sided heave. Auscultation of heartsounds should proceed over all four cardiac listen-ingareas, first with the diaphragm and then with the bell. The regularity of the heart sounds andany murmurs, rubs, or gallops should be noted.The most commonly heard murmurs and methodsto distinguish them are listed in Table 13.2. Carotid arteries Auscultation of the carotid arteries should beperformed using the bell of the stethoscope toassess for bruits (often unilateral) or transmittedmurmurs (bilateral). Pressing too firmly on thecarotids may create a false bruit. If there is confu-sion as to the source of the bruit (carotid vs. car-diac), auscultation in the region of the sternalnotch will either confirm the presence or absenceof a transmitted murmur. Palpation of the carotidpulses should also be performed to confirm nor-mal strength and upstroke. Jugular venous pressure (JVP) Findings of jugularvenous distension, hepatic congestion and per-ipheral edema. Patients from left-sided failure (most com-mon etiology), pulmonary hypertension or filling (pericardialtamponade, tension pneumothorax). The jugularvenous pressure (JVP) is noted in the anterior tri-angle of the neck (Figure 13.1). The patient should rest with the head of the bed at 30\u00b0 and the chin rotated left of midline by 30\u00b0. The pulsation is most often visible just above the clavicle. Thejugular pulse is distinguished from the carotidpulse by its double wave and lack of palpability.It can further be confirmed by noting a rise in the Chest pain 196 Primary ComplaintsTable 13.2 Most commonly heard cardiac murmurs and methods to distinguish them 30-40 \u00b0Internal jugular murmurs1.

Extremities Pulses should be assessed including symmetrybetween sides and between upper and lowerextremities.

Whenasymmetry is present, the size of each leg shouldbe measured and recorded. Abdomen Always perform the abdominal exam with thehead of the bed flat (so the patient is completelysupine), both knees bent (to relax the abdominalmusculature), and both arms down by the sides.This allows the most accurate and reproducibleexam. The examination of the abdomen shouldprogress sequentially with observation, ausculta-tion, percussion, and palpation. It is particularlyimportant to evaluate for non-thoracic causes ofchest pain, such as diseases of the gallbladder(cholecystitis or cholelithiasis). Note the presenceof bruits abdomi-nal aortic aneurysm, a potential life-threateningemergency. Rectal Rectal examination should be performed to assessfor gross blood, melena, or occult blood. Thepresence of gastrointestinal bleeding may impactimminent therapy (anticoagulant or fibrinolytictherapy), or be the source of significant bloodloss leading to cardiac ischemia. Neurologic Acomplaint-directed neurologic examination should be performed. Any new neurologic deficitsin the setting of chest pain should be presumeddue to aortic dissection and considered an emer-gency, unless proven otherwise.

AMI: Laboratory studies Complete blood count Acomplete blood count (CBC) is frequently ordered in patients with chest pain. A low hema- tocrit may indicate a reason for symptoms of car-diac ischemia, or may be due to bleedingassociated with the source of pain (gastric ulcer).Most authorities recommend maintenance of thehematocrit in a patient with cardiac ischemiaabove 30 mg/dl to maximize O 2delivery. A high white count may represent demargination due tostress, pain, or a catastrophic event (e.g., sepsisfrom delayed diagnosis of esophageal rupture).However, this test is rarely illustrative. Chemistry panel Chemistry panels generally provide little help in the evaluation of the patient with chest pain. Theymay suggest acidosis (low bicarbonate), especially in the presence of an anion gap. If intravenous (IV) contrast imaging is to be performed to evalu-atethe aorta, it is important to obtain a creatinine level prior to the administration of IV dye. Renalinsufficiency, suggested by elevated creatininelevel, is a relative contraindication to contrastinjection, as in computed tomography (CT) or car-diac catheterization. Elevated glucose may reveal previously unsuspected diabetes, a risk factor forcoronary artery disease. Cardiac markers Serial serum cardiac marker measurements can be used to rule out AMI at an appropriate inter-val from symptom onset (Table 13.4). However, serial cardiac markers are only found to be elevated in 10-30% of cases of unstable angina (USA) andtherefore cannot be used to exclude this condition. Liver function tests Liver function tests may be elevated in patients with biliary or hepatic disease, or due to passivecongestion of the liver in heart failure.Amylase/lipase When an abdominal source of pain is suspected, or tenderness is elicited in the mid-epigastrium,pancreatitis should be considered. This is especially true in the presence of risk factors(alcohol use, biliary disease, and diabetes). Urinalysis Evaluation of the urine is rarely helpful in the chest pain patient, except when glucosuria (pos- sible screen for diabetes) or bilirubinuria (possiblescreen for biliary duct obstruction or hepatic disease) are present. Pregnancy test Consider a pregnancy test in all female patients of childbearing age, especially if they may undergoradiologic imaging. Urine toxicology screen Cocaine has been associated with ACS, AMI, and aortic dissection, especially in the first hourafter use. D-dimer D-dimers are degradation products of circulating cross-linked fibrin. Sensitivity and specificity for thromboembolism vary, depending on the typeof test. Newly developed rapid tests appear to beadequately sensitive to exclude PE in low-riskpatients. In a patient with suspected PE, D-dimer testing should only be performed when the typeof test used is known to be sensitive for thrombo-embolism. Arterial blood gas Arterial blood gas sampling is useful to assess ventilatory status (CO 2level), serum pH, and to confirm a low pulse oximetry reading. In theassessment of a patient with suspected PE, it hasbeen shown to lack significant predictive value.In one study, 26% of patients with PE had a par-tial pressure of O 2(PO 2) greater than 80 mm. A low oxygen saturation, either from pulse oximetryor ABG that lacks an adequate explanation (i.e.,pneumonia, heart failure or COPD) should raisesuspicion for pulmonary embolism.

In studies of patients with AMI,ECGs are diagnostic in 30-50%, nonspecific in40-70%, and normal in up to 10%. Findings ofacute ischemia include new or presumed new STelevation, ST depression, or inverted T waves(Figure 13.2).

American Association guidelines recom-mend posterior and right-sided ECG leads whenthere are findings of ischemia such as ST eleva-tion, ST depression, or T-wave abnormalities onthe traditional 12-lead ECG (Figure 13.3). Patientswith ST- or T-wave abnormalities in the inferiorleads (II, III, and aVF) or ST depression in the sep-tal leads (V1 and V2) are most likely to haveabnormalities on posterior and right-sided ECGs. The ECG may also reveal evidence of peri- carditis (Figure 13.4) or a pericardial effusion. Radiologic studies Chest radiography Chest radiography is most helpful when it points to a definitive diagnosis such as pneumothorax orpneumonia. Although chest radiography is oftennormal or nonspecific in conditions such as AMI,PE, and aortic dissection, it may also suggest thediagnosis (Figures 13.5 and 13.6). Tables 13.5 and13.6 describe helpful in the evalu- ation of a stable patient with chest pain. It is reasonably sensitive (70 to /H1102290%) and specific (90 to /H1102295%) for PE depending on scanner tech- nology and the expertise of the radiologist. Itoften provides additional information either sug-gestive or supportive of a final diagnosis inpatients without PE. It is 95-100% sensitive andspecific for (Figure In therare that helical CT inconclusive foraortic dissection or PE, and the pre-test probabil-ity for the diagnosis is high, angiography shouldbe performed. Echocardiography This test can prove helpful in the evaluation of chest pain, especially in the unstable patient.Transthoracic echocardiography can evaluate the cardiac chamber sizes, wall motion, systolicfunction, valvular function, and tamponade physiology,regional wall motion abnormalities suggesting ischemic cardiac disease, right heart failure sug-gesting acute PE, and aortic dissection.

The goals of treatment are stabilization,symptom relief, and limitation of morbidity andmortality due to the disease entity. Patients with chest pain should receive a high triage level, indicating that they have a potentiallylife-threatening medical problem. They shouldbe placed in a room expeditiously. The initialassessment of the chest pain patient should focus on the patient's stability. If the patient has unsta-ble vital signs or appears ill, an accelerated assess-ment and treatment plan should be used. TheAmerican Heart Association guidelines for assess-ment of patients with potential ACS recommendperformance and interpretation of an ECG within10 minutes of arrival to the ED.

Secondary assessment and interventions ASA 325 mg po (unless patient allergy, appropriate dose already taken, or ischemiaexcluded) Complete H&P Provide pain relief Consider additional ECGs, radiologic andlaboratory evaluation as indicated. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) AspirinAspirin should be given to everyone with sus- pected ACS who is not allergic. Its efficacy isequivalent to that of costly thrombolytics, andcontraindications are infrequent. There is a 23%reduction in 30-day mortality in patients with AMI. In patients with USA, there is a 50% reduc-tion in the rate of progression to AMI. Dosing : 325 mg oral (or rectal). Nitrates Nitrates are recommended in AMI, although a clear benefit on morbidity or mortality has notbeen proven. Nitrates act to vasodilate the cor-onary arteries, and reduce both preload and after-load. Hypotension, a frequent and unacceptable adverse effect, should be avoided at all costs;therefore, blood pressure should be monitoredbefore each additional dosage. Sublingual NTGis recommended in patients with suspected ACS,except those with contraindications such asallergy, bradycardia less than 50 beats per minute,tachycardia, or hypotension. The use of agentsfor erectile dysfunction, sildenafil or vardenafilwithin 24 hours, or tadalafil within 48 hours, isan absolute contraindication to use of nitratesbecause of the risk of prolonged and exaggeratedvasodilatation. NTG should be used with cau-tion in patients with right ventricular infarct whoare often sensitive to preload reduction. IV NTGis indicated in patients with persistent ischemia,CHF, hypertension, or a large anterior AMI. Dosing : Treatment should begin with sublin- gual tablet or spray dosing of 0.4 mg every 5 min-utes until pain free. Three doses are commonlyrecommended but not a limit. Check blood pres- sure before each additional dose. If symptomsare relieved with sublingual therapy, apply1-2 inches of nitropaste to the anterior chest wall.Indications for IV therapy include the first 24 to48 hours for patients with definite USA or AMIwho experience ongoing or recurrent ischemicdiscomfort, hypertension, or signs of congestiveheart failure, or for controlled titration of therapy.Start an infusion at 10-20 mcg/minute and titrateby 3 to 5 minutes untilsymptom relief. Morphine Morphine is used as an analgesic for the relief of ischemic chest pain. Any patient with significantdiscomfort should receive treatment with anal-gesics, although the benefit of narcotics for painrelief in patients with AMI is inferred rather than clearly supported by literature. Dosing : Depending on the patient's previous exposure to narcotics, an initial IV dose of 2-4 mgis recommended with titration to effect. Beta-blockers Beta-blockers have been shown to decrease mor- bidity and mortality in patients with AMI andUSA. They should be used in all patients exceptthose with contraindications, such as CHF, historyof significant atrioventricular(AV) node disease, bradycardia, or hypotension. Dosing : 5 mg of metoprolol is given IV three times at 5 minute intervals. Vital signs should bechecked before each dose. If this is tolerated, then25-50 mg of metoprolol is given orally. Heparin The significant benefit shown from heparin use in patients with unstable angina was largely fromthe pre-aspirin era. A meta-analysis comparingheparin plus aspirin to aspirin alone revealed a2.4% reduction in death or MI which did not reachstatistical significance. Heparin is recommendedfor all patients with suspected AMI. It is part ofthe treatment protocol for most thrombolytic reg-imens, except streptokinase. Low molecularPrimary Complaints 207Chest painweight heparin has several advantages over IV unfractionated heparin. These include ease of usein the inpatient and outpatient setting, weight-based dosing, lack of need for laboratory moni-toring, and lower rates of heparin-inducedthombocytopenia. Bleeding rates and efficacy areequivalent, and when nursing and laboratorycosts are included, overall cost of therapy isequivalent. Precautions include extremes ofweight ( /H1102145 or renal insufficiency. Dosing IV unfractionated heparin is given as an 80 unit/kg IV bolus and an 18 unit/kg/hourinfusion. A nomogram should be used for doseadjustment. If given with alteplase, reteplase, ortenecteplase the dosing is reduced to 60 units/kg/hour infusion. For lowmolecular weight is given1mg/kg or Dalteparin 120 IU/kg SQ BID. Thrombolysis Thrombolysis is indicated in patients with AMI with ST-segment elevation (1 mm in 2 or morecontiguous leads) or presumed new left bundlebranch block and symptoms /H1102112 hours (Table 13.7). Relative mortality is reduced by 21%, withthe greatest reduction occurring in patients withbundle branch block. There is no evidence ofbenefit in patients with proven AMI lacking ECGcriteria; in fact, outcomes may be worse. Everyhour of delay to thrombolytics increases death by1.6 per 1000 patients treated. Complications, how-ever, are not benign. These include intracranialhemorrhage in 0.5-1.0% of treated patients. Bloodtransfusions are required in 5-15%. The GUSTOtrial of 40,000 patients provides the main supportfor the use of alteplase (t-PA) over streptokinase.Thirty-day mortality of alteplase plus heparinwas 6.3%, while that for streptokinase was 7.3%.Tenecteplase (also called TNKase) is a modified form of alteplase which can be delivered byweight-based complicationoutcomes. Dosing : Streptokinase: 1.5 million units IV over 60 minutes. Alteplase: 15 mg IV bolus, then 0.75 mg/kg (50 mg maximum) over 30 minutes, then 0.5 mg/kg (35 mg maximum) over the next 60 minutes.Concurrent heparin infusion. Tenecteplase: Single IV bolus over 5 seconds based on body weight: /H1108860 kg /H1100530 mg, 60-69 at the GP IIB/IIIA platelet receptor.They have been shown to be of significant benefit when given to patients receiving percutan-eous cor onary intervention (PCI). It remains controversial whether patients with USA andnon-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) benefitfrom IIB/IIIA receptor antagonism. Recom-mended indications for their use include ele-vated cardiac markers, continuing ischemia, ortransient ST changes /H110220.5 mV despite aspirin and heparin therapy. Percutaneous coronary intervention Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is an alternative to thrombolysis if performed within90 minutes of presentation. Operator experiencehas been shown to have a significant impact onoutcome. High volume centers have recently beenshown to produce significantly better results com-paredto the administration of thrombolytics, Table 13.7 Thrombolysis indications and contraindications Indications for thrombolysis ST elevation ( /H110910.1 mm in /H110912 contiguous leads) or new left bundle branch block (not known to be old) and Symptoms /H1102112 hours which are continuing Contraindications to thrombolysis Active internal bleeding (not including menses) Suspected dissection Uncontrollable hypertension of non-hemorrhagic CVA within 1 year Relative contraindications Presenting blood pressure /H11022180/110 History of chronic severe hypertension Active peptic ulcer Pregnancy Internal bleeding within 4 weeks Noncompressible vascular puncture(s) Trauma/surgery or CPR within 2-4 weeks Current use of anticoagulants in therapeutic doses (INR /H110912-3) or known bleeding diathesis History of prior CVA or known intracerebral pathology not mentioned in contraindications CVA: cerebrovascular accident;CPR: cardiopulmonary resuscitation.while low volume centers have been shown to produce outcomes inferior to that of thromboly-sis. Indications for PCI include: an alternative tothrombolysis in patients if performed within 90minutes of presentation, persisting or recurringpain despite aggressive noninvasive therapy, pres-ence of car diogenic shock /H1102236 hours after thrombolysis is contraindicated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are recommended in all patients with AMI (espe-cially with CHF and systolic blood pressuregreater than 100 mmHg) based on the ISIS-4 andGISSI-3 trials. Treatment should begin within thefirst 24 hours but not necessarily in the ED. Dosing : Begin at the lowest starting dosage for the chosen ACE inhibitor. Clopidogrel Clopidogrel is an adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonist that acts to inhibit platelet aggregation.It is indicated instead of aspirin when a patient isaspirin-allergic. The recent clopidogrel in unstableangina to prevent recurrent events (CURE) trialshowed that clopidogrel in addition to aspirinimproved outcomes when given to high-riskpatients; that is, those with dynamic ECG changesor elevated cardiac markers. Outcomes wereworse when clopidogrel was given to patientswho underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. Dosing : 300 mg oral load, then 75 mg/day. Aortic dissection The goal of aortic dissection (AD) treatment in the ED is to decrease shearing stress on the aorta bydecreasing cardiac inotropy and lowering bloodpressure. Any patient with a high suspicion fordissection should be started immediately on abeta-blocker, achieving a desired heart rate of50-60 beats per minute. Options include meto-prolol or labetalol, which has the additional bene-fitof some alpha-blockade, or esmolol, which has the benefit of an ultra-short acting effect (secondsto minutes). If beta-blockers are contraindicated,calcium channel blockers with negative inotropiceffects, such as should given. Foradditional control of SBP , nitroprusside is oftenrecommended. Management depends on the location of involvement. Dissection which involves any portion of the ascending aorta (Type A) requiresemergent surgical repair. If involvement is lim-ited to portions of the aorta distal to the right bra-chiocephalic takeoff (Type B), attempts at medicalmanagement are warranted. Pulmonary embolism Initial treatment of PE is with heparin. If IV unfractionated heparin is used, weight-baseddosing and treatment algorithms improve therate of therapeutic heparinization. Patients withsub-therapeutic heparinization in the first24 hours experience up to 15 times the rate ofrecurrent thromboembolism compared with patients who reach therapeutic anticoagulation.Low molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin andtinzaparin) are approved for patients with PEwho have documented DVTs. Clinical trials inPE, although limited, show equivalence betweenheparins in complications and efficacy. Coumadinshould be started in the first 24 hours. Coumadinis contraindicated pregnancy. Weight-baseddosing for IV bolus, followed by an 18 units/kg/hour infusion. The goal is a partial thromboplas-tin time (PTT) of 46-70 seconds.

Disposition Admission vs. discharge Admission rates are high for patients with chestpain, since it is difficult to exclude life-threaten-ing disease without an extended period of obser-vation. Admission rates vary in studies from 30%to 70%. Any patient with chest pain who has con-cerning findings, such as abnormal vital signs, anabnormal ECG, or elevated cardiac enzymesrequires admission. In addition, any patient with Chest pain 208 Primary ComplaintsPrimary Complaints 209Chest paina potentially life-threatening cause for symptoms who is awaiting definitive testing to exclude dis-ease should be admitted (or transferred to a hos-pital where the study is available) if testingcannot be performed in a reasonable time periodgiven the clinical situation. In a patient with pos-sible ACS, repeat evaluation with serial examina-tions, repeat ECGs, and cardiac marker testing isrequired. In addition, a noninvasive evaluation such as exercise treadmill testing is needed toexclude USA. If it is possible to obtain these inthe setting of a chest pain observation unit , it may not be necessary to admit these patients. In a patientwith suspected aortic dissection, a normal CT scanof the chest is reassuring for safe discharge ifother concerning etiologies have been excluded.In the patient with suspected PE, negative CT pulmonary angiography low-probability the patient. Moderate- or high-suspicion patients must receive further testing.Any patient who is discharged with chest painshould have close follow-up arranged, with clearinstructions to return for concerning symptomssuch as recurrent or increasing pain, shortness ofbreath, lightheadedness, neurologic symptoms,or other concerns. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths G iven the range of potentially life- threatening conditions associated with thecomplaint of chest pain, the history, physical examination, diagnostic testing, and treatment of such patients shouldproceed in parallel. Consider other diagnostic possibilities inaddition to cardiac ischemia in patients withchest pain. Do not exclude diseases such as PE or ACSsimply on the basis of lack of risk factors. R ecognize the limitation of emergency testing (laboratories, ECG, CXR) to exclude thepresence of life-threatening diseases such asACS, PE, and AD.Do not ignore high-risk findings, even in apatient with many low-risk findings.

In either caseit should be recognized that constipation is asymptom, not a medical diagnosis. It has been estimated that the prevalence of constipation in the adult population of industri-alized nations is as high as 20%. There are approxi-mately 2.5 million physician visits per year in the US for this symptom, and at least 20% of thepopulation habitually use over-the-counter laxa-tive preparations. Constipation is a surprisingly frequent chief presenting complaint in the emergency depart-ment (ED) despite the medical community's attitude of it being a \"minor\" problem. It is particu- larly common in the elderly and those with mul- tiple medical problems, complicating both their assessment and treatment for other conditions. It is important to recognize constipation as a preventable adverse outcome of an ED visit, andto consider selecting discharge medications withthis in mind. Anatomic essentials Normal bowel function has two components -colonic transit and defecation. Colonic transit is maintained by smooth muscle function via bowel myenteric plexuses regu-lating motility and control by theparasympathetic nervous system. Transit time isalso affected by bowel contents, specifically fiberand water. Defecation is a complex series of events in which rectal distension triggers a series ofreflexes to relax sphincters and pelvic floor muscles. This is coordinated with an increase inintra-abdominal pressure to facilitate expulsionof rectal contents. In infants, this is entirely areflex act. Voluntary control of the external anal sphincter is physiologically possible from thesecond year which children generallybecome \"toilet trained.\" Neurologic diseaseincluding spinal cord injury may obliterate vol-untary control of this reflex in adults. History It is important to establish what exactly the patientmeans when he/she complains of constipation. How often do you have bowel movements? When did you last have a bowel movement? The answers to these questions will help establish the nature and significance of a patient's com-plaints. There is a wide variation in frequency ofbowel movements; adults generally have betweenthree bowel movements per day to one every 3 days. What is the consistency of the stool? Do you ever have difficulty or pain passingstool? Many patients with normal stool frequency pre- sent with a change in consistency of their stool, or with pain on defecation. These symptoms areequally as important as stool frequency in sug-gesting abnormal bowel function. A history ofgradually diminishing or changing stool calibermay indicate an obstruction or mass, such ascolon cancer. How long have you had problems with constipation? This information helps ascertain the acuity of the problem. Long-term problems which have slowlyworsened may focus the management on therapy to relieve symptoms, while a new problem orsudden change prompts a more rigorous focus on diagnostic evaluation. Acute constipation may represent intestinal obstruction, tumor, stricture, or volvulus. Other symptoms Although sometimes constipation may be a solepresenting complaint, it is frequently part of a14 Constipation Victoria Brazil, MBBSConstipation 212 Primary Complaintssymptom complex. It is preferable to ask about associated symptoms as an open question initially,but specific enquiry should be made with regardto the following sentinel-associated symptoms: Abdominal pain It is important to recognize that constipation is a symptom , and should not be attributed as a cause of abdominal pain without a thorough search formore sinister etiologies, such as obstruction causedby colon cancer. This is particularly important inelderly patients. Rectal bleeding or dark stools Hemorrhoids and minor anal trauma causing bright bleeding are common in those with consti-pation. However, attributing bleeding to thesecauses should be done only after endoscopic orother evaluation has excluded malignancy, inflam-matory bowel disease or diverticulitis. Risk of malignancy increases with increasing age. Weight loss This may occur in conjunction with constipation due to malignancy or hypothyroidism. Diarrhea, flatulence, foul-smelling feces Inconsistent bowel habits require investigation for tumors or malabsorption, or may suggestconstipation with overflow diarrhea. Inability topass flatus should raise a concern for bowelobstruction. Diarrhea alternating with constipa-tion suggests an obstructing colonic lesion or irrit-able bowel syndrome. Flatulence and bloatingmay represent a malabsorption syndrome. Vomiting Vomiting rarely accompanies a benign cause of constipation and may suggest bowel obstruction. Past medical Specific inquiry should be made regarding dia- betes, renal failure, neurologic disorders, spinalcord lesions, thyroid disease, and depression, asconstipation is common in these conditions. Medications Patients should be asked what medications theytake regularly, both prescribed and over-the-counter. Specific questions regarding herbalmedications and treatments should be asked.This is to ascertain medications causing constipa- tion (Table 14.1), and what treatment has been attempted. Medications responsible for constipa-tion are best discontinued or modified. Dietary habits Inadequate dietary intake of fiber and water isresponsible for constipation in the majority of patients who present with this complaint. Other lifestyle factors Immobility due to illness or injury or a sedentarylifestyle make constipation more likely. Irregularroutines such as traveling or shiftwork also affect bowel function. Neurovegetative features suchas sleep disturbance or anhedonia may suggestdepression, which has been associated with con-stipation. Physical examination General appearance and vital signs Those individuals with uncomplicated constipa-tion should look well. Abnormal vital signs or apatient in significant pain or discomfort suggeststhat the constipation represents a more seriousproblem, such as bowel obstruction, perforationof colonic diverticulum, or ischemic bowel. Signsof sepsis in a patient with constipation are alwaysconcerning.Table 14.1 commonly medications - diuretics, calcium channelblockers, ACE inhibitors, lipid-lowering agents Careful and thorough abdominal examination should be performed. There may be mild disten-sion and tympany. In thin patients, stool may evenbe palpable on abdominal exam. However, signifi-cant distension, masses, abnormal bowel sounds orsigns of localized peritoneal inflammation shouldprompt an urgent search for significant pathology.Any abdominal wall scars should be noted. Rectal Examination of the anus and rectum may revealrectal blood, tumors, strictures, or fissures. Significant discomfort on examination is suggest-ive of anal trauma from hard feces. Impactedfeces may be felt on digital examination. Thisfinding may indicate mechanical obstructionrequiring manual disimpaction, possibly under some form of sedation. Anal fissures are a com-mon cause of constipation in young children. Head-to-toe The ED examination should be thorough butfocused. Patients should routinely be examined forsigns of hypothyroidism, such as dry, cool skin,fine or brittle hair, recent weight gain, lethargy, andhoarse voice. A neurologic examination shouldalso be performed (Table 14.2). Examination ofother systems should be made according to his-torical information and as suggested by abdom-inal findings. Differential diagnosis Most common Inadequate fiber and fluid in the dietLifestyle factors - immobility,medications (Table 14.1) Pregnancy Painful perianal region - hemorrhoids,abscesses, fissures, herpes infection Irritable bowel disease General debility Chronic laxative abuse In this group, the etiology is frequently multifac-torial. Less common Metabolic - hypothyroidism, hypokalemia,hypercalcemia, renal failure Intrinsic bowel lesions - tumors, strictures Inflammatory bowel disease Diverticulitis Volvulus, hernias, adhesions, pelvic or abdominal masses Neurogenic including diabetes -Spinal cord lesions -Multiple sclerosis -Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -Parkinson's disease -Cerebral palsy Uncommon Scleroderma Lead Diagnostic testing History and examination should allow the emer-gency physician to determine the urgency withwhich diagnostic testing should be undertakenin the patient presenting with constipation. Inthose previously investigated having an exacer-bation of a chronic problem, diagnostic testingmay not be necessary. Laboratory studies These tests should be ordered as directed by historyand examination. Hypokalemia and hypercalcemiaParaplegia - previous trauma, tumor, surgery, stroke, or congenital cause Acute spinal pathology - abnormal tone, power, reflexes or sensation in lower limbs, particularly ifbilateral and symmetrical Autonomic dysfunction - lability of heart rate or blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension, urinary retention, or incontinence Parkinson's disease shuffling gait Demyelination, polyneuropathies - focal neurologicdeficits in any of spinal, peripheral or upper motorneuron distributionsTable 14.2 Clinical features suggestive of neurologic disease as the etiology of constipationmay cause constipation. Tests of thyroid and renal function may be helpful in a patient not previously evaluated, as thyroid disease, renal disease, and dehydration may cause or contribute to con-stipation. Iron deficiency anemia may be present in a patient with colon carcinoma, so a completeblood count (CBC) should be considered. Radiologic studies Erect and supine abdominal radiographs mayassist in evaluating possible bowel obstruction,particularly in patients with prior abdominal sur-gery, vomiting, significant abdominal distension,abdominal pain or an acute/subacute history ofconstipation. Erect chest films may be useful tolook for free air under the diaphragm associatedwith bowel perforation. Visualization of \"fecalloading\" on plain abdominal radiographs rarelychanges management and should not be used as adiagnostic test in the absence of other indications. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) is a low yield test in the ED for evaluation of consti-pation alone, but may be extremely useful if theevaluation is part of a work-up for abdominalpain or malignancy. Outpatient studies Patients referred to their primary care physicianfrom the ED may ask what investigations mightbe performed as an outpatient. These may includecolonoscopy, endoscopy, intestinal transit studies,or anorectal manometry. General treatment principles Assess whether the constipation is part of a symptom complex (e.g., with abdominalpain) representing a life-threateningemergency? As always, identify and treat any immediate life threats first. This might occur in patients with aperforated colon carcinoma, ischemic bowel, orruptured appendix. Red flags for serious conditions include abnor- mal vital signs, a \"sick\" patient, rebound or guard-ing on abdominal examination, and co-morbiditiessuch as advanced age, chronic steroid treatment,or previous abdominal operations. Action includes evaluation of the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs), resuscitationas appropriate, and a thorough investigation,usually in consultation with a surgeon. Decide whether this presentation represents an acute crisis or complication in a patientfor whom constipation is a long-term problem? An acute crisis may occur in patients who develop bowel obstruction or become completely impacted,or in those who have developed new medicalproblems or have changed medications. Thesepatients require a focus on diagnostics in the ED. Specific therapy Treatments need to be tailored to the individual patient. Attention to dietary and lifestyle factorsmay be sufficient for mild cases of constipationand will likely improve the success rate of othertreatments. More than 700 laxative preparationsare available over-the-counter. Review of the med-icalliterature reveals little difference in effective- ness between laxatives. Common regimens forthe treatment of constipation are provided inTable 14.3. Constipation 214 Primary ComplaintsTable 14.3 Common regimens for treatment of constipation Mild constipation Senna and docusate (Senakot-S): 2 tablets PO qd for 3-4 days until relief or Psyllium (metamucil): up to 30 grams PO per dayin 2-3 divided doses or Magnesium hydroxide (milk of magnesia):30-60 ml regular strength liquid PO Moderate constipationas above plus Lactulose: 15-30 ml (syrup) or 10-20 grams (powder for oral solution) PO qd and/or Glycerin: One adult or infant suppository PR asneeded or Sodium phosphate (Fleet enema): 1 adult orpediatric enema PR (Caution if renal failure orinsufficiency) or Magnesium citrate: 150-300 ml PO divided qd-BID (Caution if renal failure or insufficiency) Severe constipationas above plus polyethylene glycol with electrolytes (GoLytely):2-4 L over PO 4 hours and/or Soap suds enema in the ED BID: two times day.Therapeutic manual disimpaction may be required, and patients may require sedation for the procedure. Laxative preparations will be required after the procedure to establish normal bowel habit. Disposition Assess whether anything in the systemsreview suggests a more extensiveinvestigation is needed. If so, where shouldthis be performed? Inpatient evaluation may be required for patients who have severe symptoms such as pain, and forthose with new diagnoses of severe hypothy-roidism, significant anemia, or neurologic deficit on clinical examination. Referral to an inpatientspecialist should occur after reversible causeshave been treated in the ED. Oupatient referral to a gastroenterologist should be made for patients with: 1.chronic constipation associated with weight loss, stool caliber; 2.refractory constipation, and; 3.constipation requiring chronic laxative use. it appropriate for the patient withuncomplicated constipation to receivesymptomatic relief with laxatives or enemas at home? This requires that bowel obstruction has been excluded, and that other social and medical consid-erations have been taken into account. These include the patient's level of self-care, ability toadminister treatment, other co-morbidities, abilityto follow-up with a primary care physician, and theability to return to the ED if the problem worsens. Discharge instructions should include discus- sion of diet (including fluid intake) and behaviormodification such as exercise and \"normalizing\"daily routines. Special patients Elderly Constipation in the elderly is more common, moredifficult to treat, and more frequently representsserious pathology. Elderly patients are less likelyto be able to manage treatment at home, and morelikely to develop complications from constipationor from treatment. However, the general princi-ples and approach are unchanged.Pediatric Bowel habits vary more commonly in children, so the problem of constipation is more difficult to define. The etiology is less commonly organic in nature and more frequently functional or behavioral. This should not preclude a thoroughevaluation and investigation for organic causes.Presentations of organic etiologies may be non-specific including poor feeding, irritability, oreven dyspnea. Referral to a pediatrician or fam-ily practitioner is essential for appropriate ongo-ing care. Neonates are a special group, and thediagnoses of anus, meconium ileusand Hirschsprung's disease must Neurologic disease Patients with neuromuscular disorders or spinalcord lesions generally have recurrent problemswith constipation. Spinal patients can often traindefecation reflexes to come under \"voluntary\"control (e.g., stroking their inner thigh). The con-dition of autonomic dysreflexia presents as high and labile blood pressur e and diaphoresis in patients due to overwhelming autonomic nervoussystem stimulation. When this critical condition occurs, patients usually appear unwell. Fecalimpaction with rectal distension is a recognizedprecipitant and needs to be treated urgently. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Do not attribute abdominal pain toconstipation without careful consideration -they are both symptoms, not diagnoses. Simple fecal loading does not cause signs ofperitonitis on abdominal examination, orabnormal vital signs. Feces evident on plain radiographs is normal - imaging is not a diagnostic modality for constipation. Imaging should beused to exclude alternative pathologies. Most constipation is caused by lifestyle,dietary factors and medications that are amenable to modification. Although thorough evaluation ofconstipation is warranted in all age groups,most patients can be investigated asoutpatients in the absence of complicatingfeatures on history or physical examination. Consider constipation as a potential adverseoutcome of all ED visits. Carefully considerall discharge medications, and advisepatients accordingly.

Constipation 216 Primary ComplaintsPrimary Complaints 217Crying and irritability Scope of the problem Small children cry and cry and cry. In part, this is due to the limited repertoire of communicationskills they possess. They cry because crying isremarkably effective; there is no other infant behavior that elicits an adult's attention andresponse more reliably than the cry. At 2 weeks of age, the average crying time of a normal infant is2 hours per day. By age 6 weeks, that increases tonearly 3 hours per day. Fortunately, it decreasesto about 1 hour per day by 12 weeks of age. Inconsolable crying is a very challenging pre- sentation for several reasons: the child (usuallyunder 2 years of age) may have nonspecificsymptoms (or no symptoms at all except for thecrying), and the associated diseases can rangefrom benign to life-threatening. Inconsolable cry-ing is also very challenging for parents. The pri-mary focus of the emergency practitioner shouldbe to search for and rule out serious causes ofcrying and irritability. Benign etiologies, althoughmore common, should be established only afterfirst considering the serious etiologies. Pathophysiology Crying is one of the only ways by which an infantcommunicates discomfort or distress. In thatsense, it is a nonspecific form of communication.However, the infant's cry is probably more than adistress signal. Studies of the acoustic qualities ofinfant cries indicate that the cry probably contains\"encoded\" messages about the state of early neu-rologic development. These characteristics are the result of various muscular factors of the vocal anatomy combined with autonomic influencesand central nervous system control. It is well rec-ognized that infants with neurologic immaturityhave abnormal cries; the cries of infants who aresmall for gestational age (SGA) correlate with theability to modulate their state and quality of alert-ness. Infants suffering from meningitis, birthasphyxia, or hyperbilirubinemia classically aredescribed bursts. The distinctive cri-du-chat (\"cry of the cat\") is associated with trisomy 18.There is no single acoustic characteristic that differentiates a normal infant's cry from that of anabnormal infant. Several characteristic cries thatmay be associated with neurologic impairmenthave been described: Very high or low pitch; Extreme changes in pitch, little or no change in pitch, or rapidly fluctuating sounds; Extreme variation in length of individual crybursts; Very short to very long latency to cry (very high or low threshold to cry after a stimulus); Flat, atonal, or stark cry with no harmonicquality, fullness, or overtones; Non-harmonic sounds that interrupt the cry. Parents are unlikely to bring an infant to anemergency department (ED) for a cry they believeis normal. Parents tend to bring their child in forevaluation of the crying when: 1.they cannot identify the source, 2.they cannot console the infant, 3.the crying is longer than usual. The words that the parents use to describe the crying may be very helpful in determining its etiology. History Physicians must rely on the parents and careproviders to give a history. It is important toascertain the onset, frequency, and duration ofcrying. Parents often report a distinctive cry forvarious situations; the infant may have one crythat communicates hunger and another that com-municates fatigue. Abnormal characteristics of aninfant's cry often elicit a parental response of con-cern, prompting a visit to the pediatrician or theED. The complaint of an abnormal cry may be theonly clue to a serious condition. However, a care-ful history can provide clues for the cause ofabnormal crying in approximately 20% of cases. The child's medical history (including birth history, pregnancy complications, hospitaliza-tions, illnesses, surgeries, and allergies) shouldbe reviewed. The clinician should ask about recent15 Crying and irritability Lee W. Shockley, MDCrying and irritability 218 Primary Complaintsmedication use, illnesses, and immunizations. Excessive persistent crying is a well-documentedside effect of the diphtheria, pertussis, andtetanus (DPT) vaccine and is probably related toa painful local reaction at the site of the vaccin-ation. Furthermore, parents may be able to pro-vide valuable clues by exploring feeding habits(including changes in the diet), bowel habits, urin-ation, fe ver, sick contacts, level of activity, and ability to be consoled. Physical examination The primary goal of the physical examination is toidentify painful conditions which might lead toexcessive crying. A careful physical examinationcan find the cause for abnormal crying in an add-itional 40% of infants (on top of the 20% diagnosedby the history alone). Although it is important toconduct a thorough physical examination, thereare several high-yield examinations to perform(Table 15.1) General appearance The general appearance of the infant should benoted with particular attention to observations ofthe cry and consolability with the parents. Willthe child take a bottle? Does feeding calm thechild? What is the child's tone and posture? Howare the parents reacting to the child? Is the childinteractive with the examiner? Vital signs Special attention should be paid to the vital signs.In particular, what is the heart rate and the respiratory rate when crying and when calm? Arectal temperature should be used to assess the child's core temperature. Hypothermia as well ashyperthermia may be signs of sepsis. Pulse oxime-try should be performed to assess for hypoxia. Thechild's weight should be measured and comparedto previous weights to assess hydration and nutri-tional status. It is also important for calculatingmedication and fluid doses, and in assessing thechild's growth curve at subsequent visits. Skin Undress the child completely to examine forrashes, bruising, insect or spider bites, open diaper pins in children wearing cloth diapers,and other signs of trauma. The state of hydrationand perfusion should also be assessed. Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat Examine the head for any signs of trauma andanterior fontanelle fullness. The ears should beexamined for otitis externa, media, and for-eign bodies. Examine the eyes for symmetricpupillary activity or retinal hemorrhages. Evertthe upper eyelids to identify foreign bodies orlashes under the lid. Apply fluorescein to thecorneas and examine them for corneal abrasionsunder ultraviolet light. Examine the nose andthroat for foreign bodies and infection. Examinethe mouth, tongue, and hypopharynx for newtooth eruptions, trauma, infections, aphthousulcers, lesions, vesicles, foreign bodies, and scaldburns on the buccal mucosa or tongue from milkheated in a microwave oven. A tongue depressoror laryngoscope (used as a tongue depressor)may be necessary to visualize the hypopharynx. Neck Examine the neck for masses, lymphadenopathy,tenderness, and rigidity (which may be absenteven in an infant with bacterial meningitis). Chest Assess for tachypnea and retractions, and aus-cultate for abnormal breath sounds. Abdomen The abdomen should be evaluated for bowelactivity, distention, tone, tenderness, and masses.Amass in the left upper quadrant is suggestive of constipation; a vertical sausage-shaped massOtoscopy Rectal examinationFluorescein staining of the corneaInspection of skin underneath clothing and diapersPalpation of bones Oral examinationAuscultation of the heart Laryngoscopic examination of the hypopharynxEversion of the eyelidPalpation of the anterior fontanelle Retinal examinationNeurologic examinationTable 15.1 High-yield examinations in the crying or irritable child (in descending order)Primary Complaints 219Crying and irritabilityis the classic (although rare) finding in intussus- ception. An olive-sized mass in the epigastriumin vomiting isdescribed in pyloric or abnor-mal the or should be identified. Genitourinary Examine for hernias (Figure 15.1) and masses. Inboys, examine the genitalia for testicular torsion,paraphimosis, and strangulation of the penis ortestes from a hair or thread tourniquet. In girls,examine for evidence of trauma. Rectal Perform a visual examination of the perineumlooking for blood or fissures. Using the tip of theexaminer's small finger, perform a gentle digitalrectal examination. Although \"currant jelly\" stool is a classically described finding in intussuscep-tion, it is often a late finding indicating bowelnecrosis. An earlier finding is occult blood in thestool on guaiac testing. Musculoskeletal Inspect and palpate the extremities. Specifically,examine for focal tenderness along bones andhairs or thread tourniquets wrapped around thedigits (Figure 15.2). Test the range of motion ofthe joints, especially the hips, for tenderness andlimitation of motion suggestive of septic arthritis. Neurologic The neurologic examination should include anassessment of the infant's overall level of activity,responsiveness, and ability to be consoled. The examination should assess movement of all of theextremities and muscle tone. Differential diagnosis Causes of inconsolable crying are legion. Theymay be classified as follows. Head and neck Head Encephalitis Headache Head trauma (skull fracture, intracranial hemorrhage, shaken baby syndrome) Meningitis Eye Corneal abrasion Foreign bodies Glaucoma Figure 15.1 Left inguinal hernia with erythema of the overlyinghemiscrotum.

Approximately half of the patients seen in the ED at the Children's Hospital were referred fromcommunity pediatricians, the remaining halfwere \"walk-in\" patients. Sixty-one percent of theinfants in this study had a condition that wasconsidered serious as determined by a panel of Crying and irritability 220 Primary Complaintsthree pediatricians not participating in the study. Aserious condition determination was made if two or three of the panel members felt the infanthad a condition that required prompt treatmentor had the potential for harm if the condition wasnot recognized and treated. Special attention should be paid to the diag- nosis of infant colic (paroxysmal fussiness, infant-ile colic, evening colic, 3-month colic). Infant colicis a syndrome characterized by: sudden attacks, usually in the evening; loud, almost continuous cry lasting several hours; the infant's face is flushed, occasionally withcircumoral pallor; abdomen is distended and tense;legs drawn up, feet are often cold (legs mayextend periodically during forceful cries); fingers are clenched; relief with the passage of flatus or feces; not quelled for long by feeding; terminates from apparent exhaustion. The etiology of infant colic is not well under-stood. The condition affects up to 20% of new-borns. Infant colic is most common at 1 month oflife and most often resolves by 3 months. Diagnostic testing In general, focused diagnostic studies should beordered based on suspicions raised from the his-tory and physical examination or when the history and physical examination do not revealor suggest the etiology of the crying. Radiologic studies Chest X-ray Achest X-ray is indicated to diagnose pneumo- nia or aspirated foreign bodies. Radiolucent foreign bodies may be suspected on the basisof air trapping. This finding is most pronouncedin an expiratory film. In the crying infant, itmay be extremely difficult to coordinate the tim-ing of the film exposure with expiration; in thesecircumstances, bilateral decubitus films can beordered. The dependent lung is compressed bythe child's own weight, simulating expiration. Skeletal X-rays Focal areas of tenderness, bruising, or deformity should prompt the ordering of skeletal X-rays. Inaddition, the \"skeletal survey\" is useful to lookfor signs of previous trauma. Several patterns ofskeletal injuries are highly correlated with non-accidental trauma (NAT) (Table 15.3). Primary Complaints 221Crying and irritability Spiral fracture of a long bone (Figure 15.3) Metaphyseal chip fractureMultiple fractures at different stages of healingFractures at unusual sites, such as ribs, lateral clavicle, sternum, or scapulaTable 15.3 Skeletal injuries associated with in the oropharynx 1/56 (2) Tibial children with excessive cryingHead computed tomography In the infant with an abnormal neurologic exam- ination (especially lateralizing findings), retinalhemorrhages, signs suspicionfor NAT, head computed tomography (CT) isindicated. aboutbrain injuries (contusions and hematomas) aswell as most skull fractures. It may also be help-ful in diagnosing hydrocephalus or other congen- ital abnormalities. An inconsolable crying infantmay have to be sedated and closely monitored inorder to obtain this study. It is important, how-ever, that indicated studies be obtained regardless of the need for sedation and monitoring, and theincrease in work that such diagnostic tests cause. Barium enema Abarium or air-contrast enema is indicated when concerns for intussusception must be answered. These tests are not only diagnostic but often thera-peutic, reducing the intussusception. Consul-tation with a pediatric surgeon and radiologist are warranted prior to the study in the case thatemergent surgical intervention is necessary (i.e.,for bowel perforation). Abdominal ultrasonogra-phy has a role in the diagnosis of intussusception,depending on the skill of the radiologist. Esophagram An esophagram may be necessary to diagnose esophageal abnormalities, such as tracheo-esophageal (TE) fistula, webs, reflux, but is rarelynecessary from the ED.Electrocardiogram An electrocardiogram (ECG) is indicated to evaluate the infant with an abnormally fast orslow heart rate or an irregular pulse. An echo-cardiogram can also provide information aboutstructural and flow abnormalities of the heart. Laboratory studies Complete blood count and blood culture Acomplete blood count (CBC) and blood culture are included in the workup of a suspected septic infant (toxic-appearing or febrile without anobvious source of infection). For a more detaileddiscussion, see Chapter 23. Glucose Abedside dextrostick can rapidly identify hypo- or hyperglycemia. Hypoglycemia in the infant is often associated with sepsis, errors of metabolism,and certain toxic ingestions. Hyperglycemia maybe the first indication of diabetes. Electrolytes Serum electrolytes may be indicated in the evalu- ation of a crying infant to look Aurinalysis and culture are indicated in crying infants. Urinary tract infections are common in infants, particularly girls younger than 12 months,boys younger than 6 months, and uncircumcised boys younger than 12 months. They may presentwith nonspecific symptoms such as inconsolablecrying. Lumbar puncture Alumbar puncture with cell count and differential, Gram stain, glucose and protein determination, and culture should be performed if meningitis issuspected as the cause of inconsolable crying. Toxicologic screening Toxicologic screening may be indicated in infants where acute or chronic exposures are considered. Be aware, however, that many toxins are not rou-tinely screened for. Toxicologic screening mayalso be negative in cases of drug withdrawal. Crying and irritability 222 Primary Complaints Figure 15.3 Spiral fracture.

If the clinical suspicion of abdominal trauma is high or theliver enzymes are elevated, the clinician shouldproceed to CT scanning of the abdomen. Amino and organic acid studies Amino and organic acid studies may be ordered in cases in which an inborn error of metabolismis suspected. These studies are rarely indicated inthe ED, however. General treatment principles There is no single medication that can be recom- mended for the crying infant because of the largevariety and spectrum of etiologies responsible. Several treatments have been advocated for infant colic, including: use of a pacifier; motion, such as rocking the infant, a bounce chair, a car ride, or a car seat on top of a dryer; softly massaging the infant's back or abdomen; playing relaxing music; simethicone drops; changing the infant's diet, feeding schedule,or techniques. Unfortunately, none of these is guaranteed. Special patients Infants who were premature or are immunocom-promised are at special risk for infectious etiolo-gies as the cause of inconsolable crying. Risk factors for NAT include: Unwanted children: accidental pregnancies, illegitimate births, the opposite sex fromwhat the parents desired, being born duringperiods of crisis or a former relationship. Difficult to rear: poor feeders, fussy behavior,abnormal sleep patterns, excessive crying,retardation, hyperactivity, behavior disorders, handicaps, or chronic disease. Poor maternal-child bonding: prematureinfants, infants separated from their mothersbecause of illness, stepchildren, or fosterchildren.A parent who is an abuser of alcohol or other drugs. Intergenerational patterns of abuse. A parent with poor impulse control or very rigid and unrealistic expectations of children. Be suspicious for NAT in: inconsistent or discrepant histories; injuries that are inconsistent with the child's age and development; alleged self-inflicted injuries; unexplained injuries; accusatory histories; delays in seeking medical care; past histories of abuse (or abused siblings); presentations for apparently unrelated complaints; unusual bruising; unusual burns; skeletal injuries in different stages laceration of the upper lip, frenulum, and floor of the mouth; psychiatric complaints; developmental delay. Disposition The disposition of the infant with persistent cryingand irritability will likely be dictated by the ultimate diagnosis. The conditions that are seriousshould prompt consultation and hospitalization.Most of the etiologies are benign and can be fol-lowed as an outpatient. If an etiology cannot beestablished after a thorough evaluation, the familyis reliable and will return should the infant's con-dition change, and adequate follow-up arrange-ments can be made, the infant can be discharged.If the decision to discharge the patient is contem-plated, it should be done only after a period ofobservation in the ED (perhaps 2-4 hours). If thereare concerns about parental reliability or safety, thechild is best admitted to the hospital. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Ask about medication use, including over-the-counter medications and medications usedCrying and irritability 224 Primary Complaintsby a breast-feeding mother. This should include topical medications that a breast-feeding mother may apply to her nipples. Listen to the parents' descriptions of the cryand document their words. It canoccasionally be helpful in making thediagnosis. Undress the infant completely and perform acomprehensive physical examination. Always consider the possibility of NAT. The diagnosis of excessive crying should bemade using a process of elimination, afterruling out the more dangerous causes. Paradoxical inconsolability (an increase incrying associated with efforts at consolation,such as lifting or rocking) can be associatedwith meningitis, peritonitis, fractures,arthritis, or abuse. All infants who are not admitted need goodfollow-up care arranged prior to leaving theED. Included in the instructions should be alist of things which should prompt a returnto the ED for reevaluation. Children with infant colic often showdecelerated growth. Failure to thrive shouldmake one suspicious about the diagnosis ofinfant colic. Sedatives (chloral hydrate, phenobarbital,alcohol, antihistamines) should not be usedfor the treatment of inconsolable crying. All 50 states have laws for the mandatoryreporting of suspected NAT in children. References 1.Behrman RE, Kliegman RM, Jenson HB (eds).

The remain-der are classified as type 1 or insulin-dependentdiabetics. Diabetes is characterized by chronic hyper- glycemia that often requires lifelong treatment.Untreated, chronic hyperglycemia eventuallyleads to both micro- and macrovascular compli-cations affecting virtually every organ system.As a result, diabetics frequently present to theemergency department (ED) with complicationssuch as severe infections, myocardial infarction(MI), stroke, renal disease, and lower extremityischemia and skin ulcerations. This chapter focuses on the diagnosis and management of acute metabolic derangementsfrequently encountered in diabetic patients.These consist of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA),hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS), andhypoglycemia. Diabetic ketoacidosis DKA is a potentially life-threatening medicalemergency. It occurs predominantly in type 1diabetics and accounts for the initial presentationof glucose-related problems in about 25% of dia-betics. Despite advances in treatment, the mor-tality rate for this condition remains 2-4%. DKA is a syndrome characterized by hyper- glycemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosiscaused by either r elative or absolute insulin defi- ciency. The treatment consists of fluid and elec-trolyte replacement, together with continuouslow-dose insulin infusion. Precipitating causes for DKA include infec- tion, MI, trauma, pregnancy, or stress. In manycases, there isn't an intercurrent disease process,and noncompliance with insulin therapy is rec-ognized as a significant precipitant of DKA.Errors of insulin dosage may occasionally be acontributing factor.Pathophysiology The primary abnormality in DKA is an absoluteor relative insulin deficiency. This leads to a risein the counter-regulatory hormones (catechol-amines, glucagon, growth hormone, and corti-sol). Changes in these hormone levels producethree major effects: 1.Hyperglycemia resulting from decreased glucose utilization hepaticgluconeogenesis; 2.Increased lipolysis leading to ketone bodyformation; 3.Increased metabolism of protein andreduction in protein synthesis. Hyperglycemia causes a profound osmotic diuresis resulting in progressive dehydration.Ketonemia and acidosis may lead to nausea andvomiting, which exacerbates fluid and electrolytelosses. History Have you had increased thirst or urinaryfrequency? Typically, patients describe the gradual onset of polyuria (increased urinary frequency) and poly- dipsia (increased thirst) with fatigue and pro-gressive weight loss. Have you had nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain? Acombination of increased ketones and prostaglandin r elease is thought to contribute to nausea and vomiting. This can lead to a misdiag- nosis of gastroenteritis in early DKA. Abdominalpain is frequently reported in DKA and has manycauses, including gastric distension and ileus. Have you been following your usual insulin schedule recently? Have you missed insulindoses or changed your diet? This has been increasingly recognized as a pre- cipitant of DKA, particularly in adolescents whooften find it more difficult to comply with insulinregimens and eat regular scheduled meals.16 Diabetes-related emergencies Christopher R.H. Newton, MDDiabetes-related emergencies 226 Primary ComplaintsHave you had a fever, painful urination, cough, or shortness of breath? Have youhad any chest pain or dark stool? Infection, acute MI, and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding are all common precipitants of DKA.Systemic inquiry should be directed at uncover-ing these precipitants. Physical examination The vital signs are often abnormal in DKA.Tachycardia is most frequently observed. As fluid deficits increase, orthostatic hypotension is com-mon. An elevated temperature is rarely caused byDKA itself and suggests the presence of infection.Hypothermia can also be associated with infec-tion, and has an increased mortality rate in thesetting of DKA. As the metabolic abnormalities progress, the patient becomes acidemic, leading to direct stimu-lation of the respiratory center in an attempt to compensate. This leads to an increased rate and depth of respiration, referred to as Kussmaul respirations . Systemic ketosis is often associated with an unusual fruity odor that may be detectedby some clinicians on the breath of patients.Progressive dehydration may also lead to changesin mental status or coma. A careful abdominalexamination is particularly important in patientspresenting with abdominal pain. Evidence of infection should always be sought on examination of diabetics, with particular atten-tion to the feet, genitourinary (GU) and rectal areasof elderly diabetics. Diagnostic testing Once intravenous (IV) access is established, abedside capillary blood glucose test should beperformed. This is usually accurate to around500 mg/dl. If capillary glucose isabove 300-400 resuscitation shouldbe initiated prior to obtaining formal laboratoryresults. The laboratory investigations needed include serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine,glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and acomplete blood count. Serum ketones should alsobe ordered, as the urine dipstick for ketones can befalsely negative. A blood gas should be obtained todocument the pH. Recent literature has shown asignificant correlation between venous and arte-rial blood gases; therefore, a venous sample is nowoften used for diagnostic purposes.The serum potassium level is extremely import- ant. Patients are usually severely potassium depleted, yet may have high serum levels on thefirst sampling. This is caused by acidosis thatenhances potassium release from cells in exchangefor hydrogen ions in an attempt to normalize thepH. Pseudohyponatremia is common and iscaused by hyperglycemia. The sodium level canbe corrected by adding 1.6 meq of sodium forevery 100 mg of glucose above 100 mg/dl. Patients with abdominal pain should also have amylase, lipase, and liver function tests ordered. Aseptic work-up, including blood and urine cultures and a chest X-ray should be considered,especially in febrile patients, but depends on thepatient's presentation. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is essential to look for evidence of hyperkalemia and to searchfor a possible precipitant of DKA, such as myocar-dial ischemia. Guidelines published by the American Diabetic Association outline a triad of biochemical require-ments for the or ketonuria. General treatment principles Many EDs now have clinical guidelines andpathways available for the management of DKA.Treatment is usually initiated after obtaining a history suggestive of DKA and a confirmatoryhigh bedside glucose. 1. Fluid replacement Vigorous fluid resuscitation is mandatory and should be initiated prior to laboratory results being available. Fluid restores intravascular vol-ume and improves perfusion to vital organs. Italso begins to lower the serum glucose. The initialfluid of choice is normal saline. Generally, inadults, the first 2 liters should be given over thefirst 2 hours. An additional 2 liters should then begiven over the next 4 hours. After that, fluid can betitrated to the patient's clinical improvement andperceived hydration state. A number of studiessuggest that hypotonic be usedafter the initial resuscitation. A 5% dextrose-containing fluid should be used when the glucoselevel falls below 300 mg/dl. Excessive fluid replacement has been previ- ously cited as a cause of important complications,Primary Complaints 227Diabetes-related emergenciessuch as cerebral edema and adult respiratory dis- tress syndrome. However, it is more common thatpatients are under-resuscitated then fluid over-loaded. It is now recognized that fluid resuscitationprobably has little or no role in the developmentof these complications. 2. Insulin therapy Insulin therapy is usually initiated once the serum electrolytes become available to ensurethat the patient is not hypokalemic. This is due tothe fact that insulin drives potassium intracellu-larly and can cause life-threatening dysrhyth-mias or respiratory paralysis in hypokalemicpatients. Insulin therapy is administered by aninitial 0.1 units/kg IV bolus followed by a contin-uous infusion of short-acting insulin, usually at arate of 0.1 units/kg/ hour (maximum usually10 units/hour initially). The IV tubing should beflushed prior to starting the infusion becauseinsulin adheres to its walls, which can make theinitial dosing erratic. A bedside capillary glucoseshould be monitored hourly when an insulininfusion is used. The insulin infusion should be continued until the serum ketones are cleared and the patient'sanion gap (sodium minus chloride and bicarbo-nate) has normalized ( /H1102112-14). Resolution of hyperglycemia usually occurs prior to this, so dex-trose must be provided to ensure normoglycemia. 3. Potassium replacement Patients with DKA usually have profound deple- tion of total body potassium caused by insulindeficiency, acidosis, osmotic diuresis, and vomit-ing. However, the initial potassium is usuallynormal or even high secondary to acidosis thatdrives hydrogen intracellularly and potassiumextracellularly. Once fluid and insulin replace-ment are initiated, potassium is forced intracellu-larly and the serum level can drop dramatically.The decision to replace potassium is made afterthe serum electrolytes become available becauseof the potentially life-threatening consequencesof giving potassium to a patient with hyper-kalemia. Peaked T-waves, prolonged PR intervals,and widened QRS complexes on the ECG provideearly evidence of hyperkalemia prior to the serumelectrolytes becoming available. For this reason, astat ECG is included in the initial evaluation. Astat potassium may be run off arterial blood from an ABG.Potassium replacement should be initiated in all patients unless the serum level is greater than5.5 meq/liter or the patient is anuric. Potassium isusually given as potassium chloride at an IV ratenot faster than 5-15 meq/hour. Patients with aninitial potassium less than 3.5 meq/liter needmore aggressive replacement prior to initiation of the insulin infusion. The goal is to maintain potas-sium in the normal range of 4-5 meq/liter whileavoiding life-threatening hypo- or hyperkalemia. Bicarbonate replacement is controversial and is not routinely recommended for the emergencymanagement of patients in DKA. Despite a num-ber of clinical trials assessing the efficacy ofbicarbonate, none has shown improvement inclinical outcomes. Bicarbonate can be consideredfor patients with an initial pH of less than 7.0. The replacement of phosphate remains con- troversial and it is not routinely done in the ED.Despite theoretical benefits, there appears to beno clinical benefit from the routine administra-tion of phosphate in patients with DKA. Serum glucose and electrolytes should be checked at 0, 2, and 4 hours from presentationand then every 4 hours during insulin infusionand potassium replacement. Capillary glucoseshould be checked at 0, 1, and 2 hours after pre-sentation and then every 1-2 hours while on theinsulin drip. Many hospitals now use DKA flow sheets that keep track of vital signs and laboratory results,which makes both patient management and docu-mentation more efficient and reliable. Special patients Pediatric patients in DKA have a higher rate ofdeveloping cerebral edema. The exact reasons forthis are unknown. Arecently published study showed that children with DKA who have lowpartial pressures of arterial carbon dioxide andhigh serum urea nitrogen concentrations at pre-sentation, and who are treated with bicarbonateare at increased risk for cerebral edema. Childrenshould have fluid replaced judiciously and beadmitted to a specialist knowledgable in themanagement of pediatric DKA. Pregnancy predisposes individuals to both dia- betes (gestational) and DKA. Pregnant patients in DKA have higher rates of complications formother and baby. Maternal acidosis decreasesfetal blood flow, and may cause fetal demise. Aswith children, pregnant patients in DKA shouldbe cared for by specialists comfortable with thecare of diabetes in pregnancy.Patients with congestive heart failure can be particularly difficult to manage. They require fluid resuscitation, yet can easily become fluidoverloaded because of poor cardiac function.Although usually unnecessary, monitoring of cen-tral venous pressure or pulmonary artery wedgepressure should be considered for patients with ahistory of prior congestive heart failure. Patients with renal failure and DKA require careful fluid and potassium replacement.Management often requires input from anephrologist or critical care specialist. Disposition The vast majority of patients with DKA requireadmission to a setting where frequent monitoringof vital signs and serial blood draws can occur.Patients with altered mental status, hypotension,or severe acidosis should be admitted to theintensive care unit. Many hospitals have policiesthat dictate admission criteria for DKA patientson insulin drips. Complications Cerebral edema and adult respiratory distresssyndrome (ARDS) are rare but life-threateningcomplications of DKA. Cerebral edema occursprimarily in pediatric patients. It manifests asprogressive deterioration in mental status 6-10hours after the initiation of therapy. There are nowarning signs or clinical predictors. Patients who develop cerebral edema should be aggressivelytreated with and dexamethasone in an intensivist. Dyspnea, hypoxemia, and diffuse pulmonary edema on chest X-ray are the classic findings ofARDS. Patients often require ventilatory sup-port. As with cerebral edema, mortality is high. Iatrogenic complications include pulmonary edema from over-aggressive fluid resuscitation,hypoglycemia from inadequate glucose monitor-ing and failure to add glucose to the fluids whenthe serum glucose falls below 300 mg/dl, andhypokalemia. Strict nursing adherence to DKAmanagement guidelines minimizes the Ketosis and acidosis are usually minimal or absent. HHS is most frequently observed inpoorly-controlled or undiagnosed type 2 diabetics.Altered level of consciousness is a common findingand may progress to coma, leading to the formername hyperosmolar nonketotic coma (HNKC).However, this term is confusing as the majority ofthese patients are not actually comatose. Mortalityin HHS is much greater than in DKA, usuallybetween 15% and 30%. This higher rate is likelyrelated to both the underlying disease precipitants and the elderly population that it affects. Pathophysiology Insulin resistance leads to inadequate tissue util-ization of glucose, resulting in hyperglycemia.Hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis fur-ther elevate the serum glucose level. As the serumglucose increases, it creates an osmotic gradientthat draws water out of the intracellular spaceand into the intravascular compartment. Whenthe serum glucose level exceeds the kidneys'capacity to reabsorb it, glucose spills into the urine,creating glucosuria and an osmotic diuresis. Patients may be able to keep up with the vol- ume losses; however, many elderly patients innursing homes do not have access to fluids or areunable to keep up with the excessive fluid losses.Therefore, they become progressively dehydrated.These fluid losses often exceed 20% of total body weight. The absence of ketoacidosis in patients with HHS has a number of potential causes, includ- ing lower levels of counterregulatory hormones, higher levels of insulin, and inhibition of lipoly-sis by the hyperosmolar state. History HHS is usually seen in elderly patients with avariety of nonspecific complaints, includingweakness and fatigue. If able to answer ques-tions, patients may complain of polyuria andpolydipsia for days or weeks prior to seekingmedical attention. Inquiries about symptoms consistent with pre- cipitants of HHS, such as infection, MI, stroke, orGI bleeding should be made. Physical examination Altered mental status and abnormal vital signsare the most fr equently encountered findings in Diabetes-related emergencies 228 Primary ComplaintsHHS. It is important to remember that elderly patients often have a degree of baseline cogni-tive impairment, making it essential to obtain adetailed history from the family or caregiverabout any change from that baseline. The degree of lethargy and coma exhibited correlates well with their serum osmolality. Patients in HHS usually exhibit evidence of volume depletion, such as poor skin turgor, drymucus membranes, and orthostatic hypotension.Evidence of cellulitis or melena should be soughtduring the physical examination. Diagnostic testing The initial diagnostic work-up for HHS is similarto that for DKA, with the addition of sending aserum osmolality. An ECG should be performedas early as possible. Precipitants of HHS shouldbe considered when ordering other studies. Bloodcultures, cardiac enzymes, chest X-ray, head com-puted tomography (CT), and lumbar puncture should be guided by the clinical presentation. Arterial blood gases are usually unnecessary unlessthere is a pulmonary component to the acid-baseabnormality. HHS is defined by a serum glucose greater than 400 mg/dl and a calculated plasma osmolal-ity greater than 315 mOsm/liter in the absence ofketosis. In practice, the serum glucose level is usu-ally greater than 600 mg/dl and the osmolality isgreater than 350 mOsm/liter, with marked elec-trolyte abnormalities. Acidosis and ketones can beseen occasionally and are usually explained by theprecipitant of the HHS. General treatment principles 1. Fluid replacement The initial resuscitation is aimed at restoring adequate tissue perfusion and decreasing serumglucose. The average fluid deficit in HHS is 8-12 liters, often double the deficit encountered inDKA. Half of this fluid deficit should be replacedIV over the first 12 hours, with the remainderover the next 24 hours. The actual rate of fluidadministration is highly variable and dependson the estimated fluid deficit, the patient's weight,and the degree of renal and cardiac impairment.Isotonic saline (0.9% NS) is the most appropriate crystalloid for initial volume restoration. This can then be substituted for half-normal saline (0.45%NS) when vital signs have normalized and thereis adequate urine output.2. Potassium replacement All patients with HHS have deficits in total body potassium. An IV infusion of potassium at10 meq/hour should be initiated in all patientswho are making urine and are not hyperkalemic.Higher rates of potassium replacement may benecessary if the patient is hypokalemic initially.Potassium levels should be monitored everyhour until consistently in the normal range. 3. Insulin infusion After adequate fluid replacement and determi- nation of the serum potassium, regular insulinmay be given as a continuous IV infusion at0.1 units/kg/hour. The insulin infusion shouldbe discontinued when the blood glucose is lessthan 250 mg/dl. At this point, 5% dextrose shouldbe added to the maintainence fluid to preventhypoglycemia. Special patients HHS most commonly occurs in the elderly, whomay have underlying cardiac or renal disease. Asdiscussed in the DKA section, this makes therapymuch more complicated and results in highermorbidity and mortality. Disposition Most patients with HHS require admission toan intensive care unit for frequent evaluation,monitoring of vital signs, and serial blood tests. Hypoglycemia Although there is no universal definition, hypo-glycemia is best defined as a low serum glucose(usually less than 50 mg/dl) with symptoms thatresolve upon administration of glucose or carbo- hydrate. The glucose level at which patientsbecome symptomatic is highly variable, as manypatients report symptoms with normal serumglucose levels, while others remain asymptomaticat serumlevels less than 50 mg/dl. Hypoglycemia is most commonly encountered in type 1 diabetics who have missed meals,increased their exercise, or increased their doseof insulin. It occurs more frequently in youngdiabetics as a result of an increased emphasis ontight glycemic control. It is also encountered indiabetics taking oral hypoglycemic agents both Primary Complaints 229Diabetes-related emergenciesduring the course of normal therapy and as a result of an intentional overdose. Sepsis, alcohol intoxication, starvation, and liver disease alsomay result in hypoglycemia. Adolescents and theelderly are at increased risks of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia should be considered in any patient presenting to the ED with altered mentalstatus or focal neurologic deficits. Rapid diagnosisis essential, as a delay in the restoration of carbo-hydrate substrate can lead to permanent neuro-logic deficits, even death. Pathophysiology Glucose homeostasis involves the intake of food aswell as the complex interactions between insulin,glucagon, and other counter-regulatory hormones. Following a meal, insulin is the major regula- tory hormone enhancing glucose utilization forfuel and storage, while also inhibiting glucoseproduction. In the fasting state, low insulin levels promote mobilization of stored fuel. Hepatic glycogen isbroken down first and is depleted in 24-48 hoursin a person with normal nutritional status. Withprolonged fasting, gluconeogenesis becomes theprimary source of glucose, with possible break-down of adipose tissue and protein. Alcohol inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis and causes problems when malnourished alcoholicsuse up already depleted glycogen stores. Sepsisalso inhibits gluconeogenesis, which in turn canlead to hypoglycemia. The brain requires a continuous supply of glu- cose for normal function. When glucose levels fall,patients develop neurologic symptoms directlyfrom a lack of glucose at the brain, and likelydevelop adrenergic symptoms from increased levels of counter-regulatory hormones. History and physical examination Hypoglycemia is a great mimic and has a varietyof clinical presentations that can fool even themost experienced physician. Adrenergic symptoms are most prominent when there is an abrupt fall in the blood glucose.These consist of anxiety, nervousness, irritability,nausea, vomiting, palpitations, tremors, diaphor-esis, and sweating. They are often referred to as the\"classic warning symptoms\" of hypoglycemia.Diabetics are usually able to recognize these symp-toms, and r espond by ingesting glucose. For this reason, they are not commonly encountered inthe ED. Adrenergic symptoms are less prominentor may be absent in some patients, especially thoseon beta-blockers. For these patients, symptomsrelated to decreased cerebral glucose predomin- ate. They range from lethargy and confusion tocombativeness and agitation. Hypoglycemia canalso cause seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and coma. Diagnostic testing The diagnosis of hypoglycemia can be made at the patient's bedside with a capillary glucoselevel, which can be confirmed with laboratoryserum glucose testing. As discussed previously,rapid diagnosis is imperative so that treatmentcan be instituted in a timely fashion. Early diag-nosis can also minimize costly work-ups forpatients with altered mental status or focal neuro-logic deficits. Further evaluation depends on the patient's clinical improvement and possible precipitants.The response to IV dextrose is usually rapid.However, hypoglycemia and altered mental sta-tus can be an initial presentation of sepsis.Therefore, if the clinical picture fits, the patientshould undergo further work-up includingblood cultures, lumbar puncture, antibiotics, andadmission. General treatment principles Once the diagnosis of hypoglycemia is made orsuspected, treatment should be initiated immedi-ately. In adults, this consists of 1 g/kg of 50%dextrose IV (initially 1-2 ampules of D50W). Inchildren less than of 25%dextrose is administered; 10% dextrose is used inneonates. These doses can be repeated if thepatient remains unresponsive. An infusion ofeither D5W or D10W can then be started to main-tain the glucose above 100 mg/dl. In patients without IV access, 1 mg glucagon can be given intramuscularly or subcutaneously.It usually takes 5-20 minutes before clinicaleffects are seen. If the patient is awake and alert, they can be given a drink containing sugar, such as orangejuice, and then a meal of complex carbohydrates. IV thiamine should be administered to alco- holic patients prior to dextrose due to thetheoretical risk of precipitating Wernicke'sencephalopathy. IV corticosteroids should beconsidered for hypoglycemia resistant to dex-trose therapy. Diabetes-related emergencies 230 Primary ComplaintsSpecial patients All patients on oral hypoglycemic agents (i.e., sulfonylureas) should be admitted for observa-tion because these drugs have long biologicalhalf-lives and a propensity for causing prolongedand severe hypoglycemia. Homeless and alcoholic patients may require a more prolonged period of observation. Theymay also benefit from seeing a social worker whocan help them with referrals to appropriate out-patient care, and psychological or possibly finan-cial support. Geriatric patients being discharged may bene- fit from having pre-filled insulin syringes or ahome nurse to assist them with their medica-tions. Social services are integral to their care. Disposition Patients with diabetes who are not on oral hypo-glycemic medications can be discharged home fol-lowing a short period of observation if they havean appropriate response to treatment and are ableto eat without difficulty. They should be instructedto follow-up with their primary care physician,including a phone call that day or the next. Adviceshould be given regarding consumption of regularmeals, including small snacks, and the warningsymptoms of hypoglycemia. If they are on insulin,the dose can be cut until they follow-up with theirphysician who manages their diabetes. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths A search for precipitants of DKA, HHS, or hypoglycemia, such as MI, stroke,infection, and GI bleeding should always be performed. It is particularly important toexamine the urine, feet, and perineal area ofelderly diabetics for a source of infection. The two main ketoacids produced in DKAare acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate.The nitroprusside ketones not beta-hydroxybutyrate. Beta-hydroxybutyrateoften predominates in early DKA; hence,false-negative results can occur if serumketones are not measured in addition to urine testing for ketones. Excessive fluid replacement has beenpreviously cited as a cause of complicationsin the management of DKA. However,patients are more commonly under-resuscitated. Always remember to replace potassium inDKA and HHS when the initial potassium isin the normal or high-normal range unless the initial potassium level is greater than5.5 meq/liter or the patient is anuric. In patients with DKA, an insulin drip mustbe continued until the anion gap is normal.This will usually require adding dextrose tothe IV fluids when the glucose level fallsbelow 300 mg/dl. Check a bedside capillary glucose; if it is low,give glucose to patients presenting withseizures, new neurological deficits, or coma. T he capillary glucose should be rechecked regularly on patients presenting with hypoglycemia. All patients on long-acting oral hypoglycemicagents presenting with hypoglycemia shouldbe admitted for observation. References 1.Glaser N.

Primary Complaints 231Diabetes-related emergenciesPrimary Complaints 233Diarrhea Scope of the problem There are estimated to be over 100 million cases of acute diarrhea in adults in the US each year.Diarrhea accounts for approximately 5% of emer-gency department (ED) visits. This complaint is even more common in children /H110213 years of age. Worldwide, diarrheal illnesses affect 3 to 5 billion people a year, accounting for over 5 to 10 milliondeaths in developing countries. Etiologies rangefrom benign conditions such as viral gastroenteri-tis to life-threatening invasive diarrheal illnesses.The most common causes of acute diarrhea areinfectious agents. Pathophysiology Diarrhea is defined as the rapid passage of exces-sively fluid stool, passing stool that takes form ofthe container rather than remaining in its naturalform, or frequency of stool greater than three timesa day. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract resorbs over 9 liters of fluid a day (the majority by the smallintestine), leaving approximately 100 ml/dayexcreted in stool. Alteration in this process maylead to diarrhea. This can occur from an increase inthe volume load presented to the GI tract, dimin-ished ability to resorb fluids by the bowel, inflam-matory processes, or an increase in gut motility. Osmotic diarrhea occurs when unabsorbable or poorly absorbable molecules such as lactuloseand laxatives challenge the small intestine.Inflammatory diarrhea occurs with inflammation of bowel mucosa, which limits its ability to resorbfluid. This can occur with numerous agents, forexample ) result in secre- tory diarrhea by increasing the amount of fluidsecreted into the bowel beyond the amountabsorbed. Diarrhea caused by increased gut motil-ity can be seen in patients with irritable bowelsyndrome or gut-altering surgery. It is important that physicians attempt to dis- tinguish between gastroenteritis and dysentery.Gastroenteritis refers to patients who have both diarrhea and vomiting, while dysentery refers to diarrhea containing blood and purulence. History The exact etiology of diarrheal illnesses is rarelydetermined in the ED. However, a thorough yetfocused history is critical in identifying importantpathogens and noninfectious etiologies (Table 17.1).Ensure privacy and empathy, as many patientsare uncomfortable discussing diarrhea. How would you describe the diarrhea? Loose, watery, or bloody stools may suggest an invasive process or GI bleeding. Abnormal rectaldischarge, greasy or foul-smelling stools maysuggest malabsorption or giardiasis.17 Diarrhea Rawle A.

Emergency Medicine: Concepts and Clinical Practice , 5th ed., episodes of diarrhea? The greater the number of daily stools may con- fer a greater risk of dehydration or electrolyteabnormality. How long have you had symptoms? Distinguishing acute versus chronic diarrheal diseases lends insight into etiology as well as possible co-morbid conditions. Acute disease isusually /H110213-4 weeks, whereas chronic disease occurs beyond this time frame. Patients withadvanced human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV /AIDS), pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease,or complex gastric or bowel surgery may sufferfrom chronic diarrhea requiring long-term ther-apy. Acute illness, the more common presenta-tion, usually requires only a short course ofsymptomatic treatment. Acute illnesses are morecommonly viral or food-borne diseases whichare self-limiting. What do you think caused your symptoms? Most patients attribute their acute illness to something they ate or being around someonewith the same illness. This is helpful if a historyof ingesting fried rice, seafood, or egg-basedproducts is obtained. Food poisoning should beconsidered when the patient's symptoms begin 1 to 6 hours after eating a high-risk meal. It isimportant to take a complete history and per-form a thorough physical examination, however,before accepting the patient's conclusions. Have you traveled recently? Travel to foreign countries where water purifica- tion and food handling is not well-regulated may suggest bacterial or parasitic causes of diarrhea.The most notable of these disorders is Monte- zuma's revenge (traveler's diarrhea) caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli . Patients who give a history of camping and drinking water from lakes orstreams may be suffering from giardiasis. Have you started any new medications? Many classes of drugs can cause acute diarrheal illnesses including laxatives, cholinergic drugs,antacids, and alcohol. Antibiotics are by far themost common cause of drug-induced diarrhealillness. Disruption of the native colonic bacterialflora can lead to overgrowth of other species, asoccurs with Clostridium difficile colitis. Associated symptoms Most patients with diarrhea complain of nonspe-cific abdominal cramps, nausea, and vomiting.Significant potassium loss may occur causingweakness or muscle cramps. Patients with feveror bloody diarrhea may have a more seriousinvasive disease caused by E. coli, Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia , or Campylobacter . In children and the elderly, severe dehydration, sepsis, anddeath can occur without adequate therapy.Weight loss suggests prolonged disease, malab- sorption, or carcinoma. Flatulence may suggestmalabsorptive diseases or parasitic infection. Past medical Patients with certain co-morbid illnesses mayhave chronic diarrhea requiring long-term care.These include but are not limited to AIDS,known irritable bowel or malabsorption syn-dromes, renal disease, certain malignancies andchemotherapy, and certain endocrine disorders. Social Sexual habits or HIV risk factors may be a criticalclue in facilitating the diagnosis of a diarrheal ill-ness in an immunocompromised host. Work his-tory may also be helpful. For example, foodhandlers, day-care workers and health-careworkers may require work restriction to preventthe spread of diarrheal illnesses. Physical examination The physical examination assists emergencyphysicians in the diagnosis as well as helps themgauge the patient's clinical status. The most impor-tant initial clinical assessment in a patient com-plaining of diarrhea is volume status . As with any chief complaint, consideration of all organ systemsis important to avoid missed diagnoses. General appearance The general clinical impression of whether a patient is sick or not is a critical piece of clinicalPrimary Complaints 235Diarrheainformation. In patients who appear toxic with high fever, tachycardia, and/or hypotension, suspect invasive disease causing bacteremiaand sepsis. Patients with more benign dis-eases generally appear mildly uncomfortable orrelatively well. Vital signs The presence of tachycardia or hypotension sug-gests dehydration. In the presence of fever, aninvasive etiology should be considered, althoughthis finding is neither sensitive nor specific. Head, eyes, ears, nose, throat and neck Dry mucous membranes, sunken fontanelle inchildren, poor skin tur gor, sunken eyes, or poor capillary refill suggest severe volume depletion.Also inspect the thyroid gland for a mass, whichmay suggest hyperthyroidism. Abdomen Most patients have generalized mild abdominaltenderness and increased bowel sounds. Patientswith inflammatory bowel disease will often havemild focal findings. In general, peritoneal signs are not present. Neurologic Alteration in mental status may be related to vol-ume loss or electrolyte abnormalities. It may beassociated with specific typhi , Shigella and Campylobacter turgor and/or poor capillary refill sug-gest dehydration. Rectal Rectal examination should be performed gentlyon the majority of patients complaining of diar-rhea. Extraintestinal manifestations of inflamma- tory bowel disease may be suggested if perianalfissures or fistulae are found. Grossly bloody stool,pus, or mucus support inflammatory, invasive, orischemic processes. In elderly patients and thosewith Hirschprung's disease, fecal impaction canresult in diarrhea or liquid stool passing around the impaction (\"overflow diarrhea\"). Differential diagnosis Tables 17.2 and 17.3 summarize pertinent differ- ential diagnoses for patients with diarrhea,divided by infectious and non-infectious causes. Table 17.2 Infectious causes of diarrhea Toxin producers Ciguatera fish toxin Bacillus cereus 17.3 Non-infectious causes of diarrhea Lactose intolerance Reaction to medications Inflammatory bowel disease Irritable bowel disease Bowel-altering surgery Mesenteric ischemia Bowel obstruction Cancer Hyperthyroidism Laxative abuseDiagnostic testing Diagnostic testing is rarely necessary for patients presenting to the ED with diarrhea. Testing shouldbe driven by clues obtained in the history andphysical examination. Patients with chronic diar-rhea can usually be managed in an outpatient set- ting. Patients who appear toxic or have bloodydiarrhea, however, may warrant diagnostic testing. Laboratory studies Complete blood count Acomplete blood count (CBC) should be obtained in patients with significant blood loss or systemic toxicity. Nonspecific findings mayinclude a leukocytosis with a leftward shift.Eosinophilia is rarely seen and is most likelyassociated with Strongyloides stercoralis. Anemia may be seen with any agent causing bloody diar-rhea, such as Shigella or Salmonella . Electrolytes Electrolytes should be obtained in patients with signs or symptoms of severe dehydration orthose suffering from co-morbid illnesses that maylead to electrolyte alteration. Patients on diuretics,those with diabetes and the elderly may be moresusceptible to rapidly-developing electrolyte disturbances. Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, loss. leukocytes (Wright's stain) Normally, stool should not contain leukocytes. The presence of fecal leukocytes suggests a bac-terial etiology. As leukocytes are not present instool, this test is highly sensitive and specific. Stool cultures Cultures may be helpful in patients with a his- tory and physical examination consistent withinvasive diarrhea, when public health concernsexist (food handlers, day-care workers, health-care workers) or when stool Gram's stain is posi-tive for fecal leukocytes. Stool cultures may bethe most useful in children, toxic patients, immunocompromised patients, patients withbloody diarrhea, or those with diarrhea for morethan 3 days.Stool ova and parasites This study should be obtained if the patient has traveled to an endemic area or has chronicdiarrhea. Immunocompromised patients withprolonged diarrheal illnesses who have failedstandard antibiotic therapy should also have thesestool studies performed. Giardia- specific antigen Giardia- specific antigen (GSA) is the most common diagnostic method for visualizing Giardia cysts. This test may be useful in disease outbreaks and for diarrhea occurring at day-care settings. Clostridium difficile toxin This stool test should be ordered if C. difficile colitis is suspected in patients with a diarrheal illness preceded by antibiotic use. Escherichia coli O157 : H7 toxin This stool study should be ordered in afebrile patients having bloody or nonbloody diarrheawho are at risk for exposure to this toxin (con-taminated beef or water, or exposure to someonewith known disease). The laboratory should beinformed that this disease process is suspected,since a special media is needed (MacConkeysorbitol agar). Pregnancy test While not essential to the diagnosis of acute diarrheal illnesses, this test should generally beobtained in women of childbearing age with any abdominal complaint (cramping, burning,pain). Pregnancy should be considered when rec-ommending medications to treat or relievesymptoms. Blood cultures Blood cultures may be appropriate in patients who demonstrate signs or symptoms of systemictoxicity or sepsis. Radiologic studies Radiographic studies are rarely indicated unlessanother process is suspected (e.g., small or largebowel obstruction with overflow diarrhea, ortoxic megacolon). Diarrhea 236 Primary ComplaintsGeneral treatment principles Rehydration and electrolyte repletion Initial treatment consists of restoring hydration status. Mild dehydration can be treated with oralfluids. Oral solutions should contain some glu-cose, which stimulates resorption of water by thesmall intestine. Milk products should be avoidedsince some patients develop a temporary defi-ciency of lactase. Moderate to severe dehydra-tion should be treated with intravenous (IV)fluids. One to two liters of normal saline or D5normal saline will usually suffice. In patientswith the most commonbeing hypokalemia and hypochloremia, IV fluidscan be administered in the ED to correct theseimbalances. Antimotility agents Some experts warn that antimotility agents suchas loperamide and diphenoxylate should be usedcautiously in individuals with infectious diar- rhea. They argue that these agents may precipi- tate toxic megacolon or delay the excretion ofpathogens leading to prolongation of symptoms.However, there is little evidence to support thisclaim. Caution should be taken in recommend-ing diphenoxylate in children, particularly those2 years of age and younger (Table 17.4).

Of the empiric therapiesavailable, the fluoroquinolones offer the bestproven advantage. Resistance to this class ofantibiotics is low, and they do not interfere withthe endogenous colonic flora. Also, unlike otherantibiotics, quinolones do not appear to prolongthe carrier state associated with Salmonella infec- tions. In general, antibiotics decrease the length ofdisease by about 1 day and may be indicated inindividuals with fever, fecal leukocytes, bloodydiarrhea, symptoms for more than 3 days, ortravelers. Other agents Other symptomatic treatments include anti-motility agents and bismuth subsalicylate (Table 17.4). Dietary restriction There are several agents that should be avoideduntil the patient's diarrhea subsides. These includeraw fruits, caffeine (increases motility), milk or lactose-containing products, and sorbitol (increa-ses the osmotic load). Special patients While most diarrheal illnesses are self-limitedand otherwise benign, special care needs to betaken with certain patients. Individuals who are immunocompromised, elderly, have multiple co-morbidites, and children may have less r eserve to withstand even minor fluid, electrolyte, hema-tologic, or hemodynamic abnormalities. In theseindividuals, treatment should be dictated bytheir underlying condition. Pediatric The major concern in children is hydration status.This can be assessed historically by determiningchanges in urine output, oral intake, and the num-ber of wet diapers. The majority of diarrheal illnesses in children are of viral origin, with rota-virus accounting for up to 50% of cases. Fortu-nately, the duration of illness is usually short andself-limited.Elderly The elderly may succumb to any of the afore-mentioned etiologies of diarrheal disease but, likechildren, may become ill faster. They may requiremore aggressive therapy, diagnostic testing, andpossibly hospital admission. Immune compromised Those with immune-compromising illness suchas HIV/AIDS may present with studies including stool ova and para-sites and stool cultures. Those with CD4 countsless than 200 will tend to suffer from severe vol-ume loss, weight loss, and intractable illnessdespite appropriate therapy. Travelers Travelers with diarrheal illness are usually infected with E. coli , Rotavirus , Salmonella , or Campylobacter . Fortunately, this disease process is self-limitedand usually resolves in a few days requiring onlya short course of antibiotics and/or symptomatictherapy. Disposition Most patients with diarrhea can be safely dis-charged from the ED with symptomatic therapy.They should be instructed to drink clear fluidscontaining some sugar and a eat simple diet (e.g.,bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast, known asthe BRAT diet). Patients should be instructed touse strict hand-washing, limit unnecessary con-tacts (e.g., school, food handlers, day care) toprevent spread, and follow up with their pri-mary care physician as needed. Patients whohave persistently abnormal vital signs, contin-ued nausea, vomiting, or copious stool outputshould be considered for admission for hydra-tion, observation, and other therapies such asantibiotics. All patients should be instructed to follow up with their primary care physician or asked toreturn to the ED if their symptoms worsen. Public health officials should be notified when E. coli O157 : H7 toxin is diagnosed or strongly suspected. Other infectious agents may requirereporting to public health officials as well.Primary Complaints 239Diarrhea Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Pearls 1.Diarrhea is a common presenting complaint to the ED requiring thorough understandingof its pathophysiology and treatment. 2.Focus the history to include recent travel,medications, co-morbid disease(s), andassociated symptoms. 3.Disease severity should be assessed basedon the vital signs and physical examination. 4.Grossly bloody diarrhea is almost alwaysfrom invasive bacteria and not viralpathogens. 5.The hallmark of treatment in any diarrhealillness begins with rehydration. 6.Laboratory and radiographic studies arerarely warranted for patients with diarrheaunless dictated by physical findings(hypotension, tachycardia, severedehydration, mental status changes). 7.All diarrheal illnesses are not infectious. Pitfalls 1.Not performing a thorough history andphysical examination. 2.Not addressing abnormal vital signs (tachycar dia, fever, hypotension, tachypnea). Myths 1.The use of antidiarrheal agents should not for symptomatic relief because theymay precipitate toxic megacolon. 2.Antibiotics prolong Salmonella carrier state.References 1.Braunwald E.

It is the most com-mon complaint in patients over the age of 75 years.Approximately 7% of ED patients present withdizziness, and dizzy patients account for 1.5% ofadmitted patients. Evaluating the dizzy patient can be challeng- ing, since it is a nonspecific symptom and is dif-ficult to objectively measure. Although mostcases are usually benign, emergency physiciansneed to be wary about life-threatening causes ofdizziness, such as cardiac dysrhythmias and cerebrovascular events. In some cases, however, the patient can be cured at the bedside. Pathophysiology Two studies performed approximately 30 years apart have confirmed that there are four generalsubtypes of dizziness: vertigo, near-syncope, dis-equilibrium, and psychophysiologic dizziness. Itis important to realize, however, that a personmay describe more than one subtype, but rarelywill describe elements of all four. Pertinent anatomy that contributes to dizziness includes the vestibular, visual, proprioceptive,cardiac, and central nervous systems (CNS). Vertigo Vertigo is defined as an illusion of motion. The CNS coordinates and integrates sensory inputfrom the visual, vestibular, and proprioceptivesystems. Vertigo occurs when there is a mismatchof information from two or more of these systems.Vertigo is divided into central and peripheral causes (Table 18.1). Central vertigo indicates involvement of the cerebellum or the vestibularnuclei within the pons and medulla. Peripheral vertigo indicates involvement of either the eighth cranial nerve (CN) or the vestibular apparatus ofthe inner ear, and is usually benign. Benign pos-itional vertigo (BPV), the most common cause ofvertigo, results from the inappropriate presence ofcalcium particles (otoliths) in the semicircularcanals. Movement of the head causes theseotoliths to inappropriately trigger receptors in thesemicircular canal, causing the sensation of ver-tigo. In M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, there is an increase inthe volume of endolymph associated with disten-sion of the endolymphatic system (endolymphatichydrops), causing fluctuating sensori-neural hearing loss, and tinnitus. Ruptures of themembranous labyrinth are thought to cause thesudden episodic attacks of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. Near-syncope Near-syncope is the sensation of feeling faint.Like vertigo, it is a common experience. Unlikevertigo, there is no illusion of motion. Near-syncope is due to the global reduction of bloodflow to the brain. Since people rise from the supineand sitting positions multiple times a day, a com-plicated neural reflex has evolved; the CNS putsout a stimulus causing vasoconstriction to com-bat gravitational pooling of blood in the lowerextremities while preserving blood flow to thebrain. There are many things that can interfere18 Dizziness and vertigo Andrew K. Chang, MD Peripheral Central Onset Sudden Gradual Intensity Severe MildDuration Seconds ContinuousNystagmus Fatigable Non-fatigableDirection of Unidirectional Multidirectional nystagmus Associated None Usuallyneurologic presentfindings Hearing loss May be present None or tinnitus Associated Frequent, Infrequent, nausea severe mildor vomitingTable 18.1 Differentiating between peripheral and central causes of vertigoDizziness and vertigo 242 Primary Complaintswith this reflex, such as orthostatic hypotension, cardiac disease, vasovagal syndrome, hyperven-tilation, and environmental factors. When thisneural reflex fails, pallor, nausea, r ubbery legs, diaphoresis, and constriction of the visual fields occur. These warning signs are the brain's way ofsignaling the person to lie down, making it easierto perfuse the brain. If the person is unable to lie down, he may progress from near-syncope tosyncope. If this still does not cause him to lie hor-izontally, the body will make antigravity posturesthat may be misinterpreted as a seizure. Thisunfortunate chain of events can lead to unneces-sary work-ups. Disequilibrium The third category of dizziness is disequilibrium.Disequilibrium occurs because of disruptionbetween the sensory inputs and motor outputs,which often results in an unsteady gait. This isusually a disease of the elderly, as there is an age-related decline in the ability of the CNS to process sensory inputs as well as control postural reflexes.Disequilibrium is often exacerbated by unfamiliarsurroundings, uneven ground, or poor lighting.The most common cause of disequilibrium is cer-vical spondylosis, which leads to spinal cordmyelopathy. Patients have poor proprioception inthe legs, which leads to a stiff-legged gait. Thesepatients usually demonstrate a positive Rombergtest, in which disequilibrium with the eyes closedand feet together suggests impaired propriocep-tion. Other causes of disequilibrium are listed inTable 18.2. Psychophysiologic dizziness The fourth category of dizziness is psychophysi-ologic dizziness. The mechanism is poorlyunderstood but is felt to result from impairedcentral integration of sensory signals. Patientsexperience feelings of dissociation, as thoughone has left one's own body. These patients areoften in a hypervigilant state and constantly moni-torthemselves for any signs of impending dizzi- ness. Their exaggeration of reactions to normalchanges often induces great psychologic stress,including hyperventilation. In reality, theirsymptoms are actually quite mild, and anxiety isfelt to be the sine qua non of psychophysiologic dizziness. Indeed, dizziness is the most commonsomatic symptom associated with panic disorder. History The medical history provided by the patient orwitnesses is the most important source of infor-mation in the evaluation of the dizziness. Twooffice-based studies found that the eti ology of dizziness could be made using history alone in approximately 70% of patients. What do you mean, dizzy? In emergency medicine, time frames are often constrained and history is usually obtained inthe form of closed-ended questions. However,the dizzy patient is best approached using open-ended questions. It is counterproductive to sug-gest definitions for patients, such as asking themwhether the room spins or whether they feellightheaded. Patients who present with dizzinessare often very suggestible and tend to answeraffirmatively to suggestive questions. In add-ition, their symptoms can persist or recur. Theirhistory thus becomes distorted and can causeconfusion for future emergency physicians orconsultants. Patients with vertigo will offer that the \"room is spinning.\" However, other descriptions such asrocking, tilting, somersaulting, or descending in an elevator may also be used to describe vertigo. Patients with near-syncope generally respond that they feel like they are \"going to faint.\" Patients with disequilibrium typically respond that they feel like they are \"going to fall\" or thatthey feel \"unsteady on their feet.\" Patients with psychophysiologic dizziness commonly share that they feel as if they have \"lefttheir own body,\" or that they are \"floating orswimming.\" Some patients describe a spinningsensation inside their head. Unlike vertigo, thistype of spinning is not associated with an illusionof motion of the environment, and the patientdoes not have nystagmus on examination. Insome cases, patients may be unable to describetheir dizziness using words other than \"dizzy.\" Cervical spondylosis Parkinson's disease Cerebellar disease Hydrocephalus Multi-infarct syndrome neuropathy vestibulopathyTable 18.2 Causes of disequilibriumPrimary Complaints 243Dizziness and vertigoHave you had any (recent or past) history of head trauma? Since BPV is generally a disease of the elderly, the emergency physician should ask youngerpatients about a history of head trauma, even if itoccurred years ago (head trauma can dislodgethe otoliths from the utricular macule, allowingthem to enter the semicircular canal). Do you any new neurologic symptoms? Diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, gait abnormality, or other focal complaints are concern-ing for a central cause of vertigo and dizziness. Have you recently had a viral illness? The patient should be asked about current or recent viral illnesses, which are often associated with labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis. How long do your symptoms of vertigo last? In general, episodes of vertigo vary depending on the disease process. For BPV , episodes last forseconds; for a transient ischemic attack (TIA) orvertebrobasilar insufficiency, episodes last forminutes; for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's for hours; and for vestibular neuritisand labyrinthitis, episodes last for days. The duration of symptoms is helpful in differ- entiating BPV from labyrinthitis and vestibularneuritis. The patient with BPV has episodes ofvertigo that last only seconds at a time and arecaused by head movements. However, the patientmay describe that he has been having continuousvertigo when in fact he is experiencing manyattacks during the day. For this reason, it isimportan t for the emergency physician to elicit how long each individual episode of vertigo lasts. Labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis, on the other hand, tend to be continuous and last for severaldays. These may or may not be worsened withhead movement. Therefore, during history taking,if a patient states that the room is spinning and hishead is still (and has not been manipulated ormoved), the diagnosis is probably not BPV . Is your hearing affected? The key to the diagnosis of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is fluctuating hearing levels in patients with episodicvertigo. Hearing is also affected in labyrinthitis,which distinguishes it from vestibular neuritis.Cerumen impaction, otitis media, and cerebello-pontine angle tumors may also result in hearingloss. Tinnitus (the perception of sound in theabsence of an acoustic stimulus) occurs withM\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, acoustic neuromas, and medication toxicity. Do you have a headache? Vertigo associated with migraine is thought to be due to vasospasm or to an inherited metabolic defect. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency represent infarction of the lateral brainstemor cerebellum. Do you have chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations? Cardiac dysrhythmias produce spontaneous episodes of dizziness that can occur in any pos-ition and can be associated with other cardiacsymptoms, such as palpitations and chest pain.Intermittent dysrhythmias may not be identifiedon a single electrocardiogram, so patients withepisodic near-syncope of unknown cause shouldundergo monitoring to search for pauses,sinus bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and sustainedsupraventricular and ventricular tachycardias. What makes your dizziness worse? Standing from a sitting or reclining position?Exertion? Walking or standing comparedwith sitting or lying down? Orthostatic hypotension is usually due to acute blood loss, dehydration, over-diuresis, or anti-hypertensive medications. Gravitational pooling ofblood in the legs occurs when the patient stands. Symptoms that are exacerbated with head turning, lying down, or rolling over in bed aremore suggestive of vertigo. In vasovagal or neurally-mediated near- syncope, the blood pressure is not necessarilyreduced immediately upon standing, as it is in orthostatic hypotension. Disequilibrium is typically worse while walk- ing or standing, but patients are relativelyasymptomatic while sitting or lying down. Do your attacks occur with certain foods? In susceptible patients, panic attacks can be pre- cipitated by a large number of substances,including caffeine and lactate. One hypothesis isthat panic attacks result from loss of central con- trol of the locus ceruleus, leading to the episodicrelease of catecholamines. These patients often have symptoms of agoraphobia as well. Additional important historical questions that should be asked include how the dizziness began,previous episodes of dizziness, how frequentlythe attacks occur, what the provoking and palliating factors are, and associated symptoms. Past medical Adetailed medical history is important to obtain since there are many factors that cause or exacer-bate dizziness. Drug and alcohol abuse, previouspsychiatric history, certain medical diseases,such as diabetes and heart disease, as well as cer-tain neurologic diseases, such as seizures andmigraine are important to elicit from the patient. Do you have a history of anxiety or panic attacks? Hyperventilation, which commonly occurs in anx- ious patients, lowers the carbon dioxide concen-tration in the blood. This leads to vasoconstrictionof cerebral blood vessels which may contributeto near-syncope. However, it is important to be aware that the panic attack may actually be inter-mittent episodes of supraventricular tachycardia,which can also cause anxiety and palpitations. What medications do you take? Amedication history is important, as many medi- cations are vestibulotoxic. Common examples include aspirin and aminoglycosides. However, vertigo itself is rarely caused by medications,since both sides are usually affected equally. Physical examination General appearance The general appearance of the dizzy patient varieswidely, from the healthy young adult to the frailelderly patient. Patients who are dizzy and vomit-ing generally appear extremely uncomfortable,and may even be ashen and diaphoretic. Vital signs Blood pressure Hypertension in a dizzy patient should raise con- cern for vertebrobasilar insufficiency, cerebellarinfarction, or hemorrhage as a possible cause.Hypotension can lead to decreased cerebral per-fusion and may be associated with near-syncope.Orthostatic vital signs can be checked but are notoriously unreliable in elderly patients.Differences in blood pressures between arms canindicate subclavian steal syndrome (which mayresult in vertebrobasilar insufficiency) or aortic dissection. Heart rate Both tachycardia and bradycardia can impair cardiac output and lead to near-syncope via cere-bral hypoperfusion. Respiratory rate As mentioned earlier, hyperventilation can con- tribute to hypoperfusion of the brain throughvasoconstriction of cerebral blood vessels. Temperature Fever alone may produce a sensation of dizziness and also may accompany CNS or other infections. Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat Eyes The emergency physician should ask the patient to look to the right and left to check for the pres-ence of nystagmus. Avoid having the patient fix-ate on an object, such as a pen or finger, sincevisual fixation can inhibit nystagmus. The phys-ician should note the nature of the nystagmus(horizontal, rotary or torsional, horizontal-rotary,vertical, or vertical-rotary), its direction (based onthe direction of the fast component), and its dura-tion.With vestibular disease, the fast component usually beats toward the side of the lesion. Inperipheral vertigo, spontaneous nystagmus usu-ally continues in one direction even when thedirection of the gaze changes. In contrast, centralcauses (such as cerebellar or brainstem infarc-tion, or hemorrhage) result in nystagmus thatchanges direction with change in the gaze direc-tion. The of peripheral vertigo is typ-ically the nystagmus of central vertigo isnot. There are exceptions to this rule, such asBPV caused by cupulolithiasis, which results innon-fatigable nystagmus. In addition, the pres-ence of nystagmus at extreme end-gaze is seen inup to 60% of normal people. Dizziness and vertigo 244 Primary ComplaintsEars External auditory canal: this cholesteatoma. signs of otitis media. Aperforated or scarred tympanic membrane may indicate a perilymphatic fistula. This canbe confirmed with pneumatic otoscopy. Hearing should also be tested. Theemergency physician can use either theticking of a watch or the rubbing of fingersnear the patient's ears. Unilateral hearing lossis suggestive of labyrinthitis, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, or acousticneuroma, although the latter usually presentswith gradual hearing loss. Cardiovascular The heart should be auscultated for the presenceof dysrhythmias and murmurs. The or hyper-trophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, both whichmay decrease cardiac output. In addition, thecarotid arteries should be auscultated for the pres-ence of bruits, which may indicate carotid stenosisas a contributing cause of cerebral hypoperfusion. Neurologic All patients with dizziness need a comprehensiveneurologic examination, with special attention tothe CNs, cerebellar examination, and gait testing. Cranial nerves CN abnormalities strongly suggest a central process: CN I dysfunction is suggested by uni- or bilateral decrease in or loss of smell. CN II dysfunction is suggested by loss invisual acuity and abnormalities on fundu-scopic examination (papilledema, opticatrophy). CN III, IV , VI dysfunction is suggested bydysconjugate gaze with formal EOM testing. CN V dysfunction is suggested by weak or absent contraction of the temporal andmasseter muscles or decrease in or loss offacial sensation. Loss of the corneal reflexalso suggests CN V dysfunction. CN VII dysfunction is suggested by facialdroop or weakness of one side of the face.CN VIII dysfunction is suggested by decreasedhearing. CN IX, X dysfunction is suggested byhoarseness or a nasal quality to the patient'svoice, a history of swallowing difficulty, andasymmetric movements of the soft palate andpharynx when the patient is asked to say\"aah.\" CN XI dysfunction is suggested and plastysmamuscles. CN XII dysfunction is suggested bydysarthria and deviation of the protrudedtongue towards the involved side. Cerebellar Cerebellar function can be evaluated using rapid alternative movements or point-to-point testing.The slow, irregular, and clumsy movements thatoccur with rapid alternating movements arecalled dysdiadochokinesis and indicate cerebellar disease. Cerebellar disease also results in move-ments that are clumsy, unsteady, and inappropri-ately varying in their speed, force, and direction. The Romberg test is a functional test of pos- ition sense (Figure 18.1). The patient stands withhis feet together and is then told to close his eyes.In ataxia due to loss of position sense, vision Primary Complaints 245Dizziness and vertigo Eyes closed Figure 18.1 Positive Romberg test.compensates for the sensory loss. When the eyes are closed, the patient loses balance resulting in apositive Romberg sign. With cerebellar ataxia,the patient has difficulty standing with his or herfeet together regardless of whether the eyes areopen or closed. Gait testing Whenever possible, gait should be tested. Ataxia (a gait that lacks coordination with reeling andinstability) may be due to cerebellar disease, lossof position sense, or intoxication. Tandem walk-ing may bring out an ataxia not previously obvi-ous. The broad-based ataxic gait of cerebellardisorders is readily distinguished from themilder gait disorders seen with vestibular or sen-sory loss. Rectal Arectal examination may be useful to suggest anemia from gastrointestinal bleeding, andshould be considered in the dizzy patient with ahistory consistent with near-syncope. Clinical tests Orthostatic vital signs Orthostatic hypotension is generally defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure of at least 15-20 mmHg within 2 minutes of standingupright. Orthostatic vital signs may help suggest hypovolemia, but are very nonspecific, especiallyin the elderly, and should not be consideredpathognomonic. Hallpike test For patients with a history consistent with ver- tigo, a Hallpike test (also known as theDix-Hallpike, Nylan-Barany, or Barany test)should be performed at the bedside. This is per-formed as follows: the patient sits upright in thegurney with the head turned 45\u00b0 to one side. Thepatient is then guided down to the supine posi-tion with the head overhanging the edge of thegurney. The eyes are viewed for evidence of tor-sional nystagmus and the patient is questionedregarding reproduction of symptoms. By turning the head 45\u00b0 to one side, the posterior semicircu-lar canal becomes aligned in the direction ofmovement when the head is laid down. Thisserves as the most provocative way to move theotoliths and reproduce symptoms. The patient isthen returned to the sitting position and the eyesare viewed again (Figure 18.2). With BPV , thedirection of nystagmus will be opposite in thehead-hanging and sitting positions. In the head-hanging position, the eyes beat upward (towardthe forehead) and toward the affected ear in thefast phase. The nystagmus fatigues withrepeated positioning, and there is usually a brief latency from the time the head-hanging positionis achieved to the onset of nystagmus. The test isthen repeated with the head turned in the oppos-ite direction. This test does not need to be donerapidly, as it is a \"positional\" as opposed to a\"positioning\" test. Although it is theoreticallypossible to have bilateral BPV , generally only oneside tests positive in patients with BPV . This pos-itive side serves as the starting point for theEpley maneuver, described in the treatment section. Head-thrust test This test should be performed if unilateral peripheral vestibular loss is suspected, as investibular neuritis or labyrinthitis. The patient'shead is quickly rotated about the sidewhile the patient fixates on the examiner's nose.With unilateral peripheral vestibular loss, the eyes cannot maintain focus, and a saccade (quickrotation of the eyes from one fixation point to another) will occur bringing the eyes back to theexaminer's nose.

For example, patients who have aclassic history for BPV , a positive Hallpike test,and a normal neurologic examination do not nec-essarily need laboratory tests or imaging studies. Any patient with a focal neurologic examin- ation should receive computed tomography (CT) of the brain and if possible, magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) of the brain. Laboratory tests Laboratory testing is rarely helpful in the eval-uation of the dizzy patient. A hemoglobin andhematocrit may be helpful to detect anemia, and aglucose level may be useful to exclude hypo- orhyperglycemia, especially in the diabetic patient.In addition, electrolytes, renal function tests, and atoxicology screen may be helpful in certain cases. Electrocardiogram An electrocardiogram is appropriate if the emer-gency physician suspects a cardiac cause for a patient's dizziness, especially if the history issuggestive of near-syncope. The emergencyphysician should look for evidence of dysrhyth-mia or ischemia. Radiologic studies Any patient with concern for central vertigo or who has focal neurologic deficits on examin-ation should receive an advanced imaging test.Dizziness and vertigoCranial computed tomography This study is commonly available but has limited utility when evaluating the posterior fossa. A neg-ative CT in a patient with deficitsdemands further testing or subspecialty consult-ation (Figure 18.3).Cranial magnetic resonance imaging This is more likely to detect subtle brainstem or inferior cerebellar infarction (Figure 18.4). General treatment principles Symptomatic care is usually all that is needed for the dizzy patient. If a patient is nauseated oractively vomiting, an intravenous (IV) line shouldbe established and antiemetic medication givenalong with IV hydration. Fluids should also begiven if the physician suspects hypovolemia ordehydration as a contributing cause. If a cardiaccause is being considered, oxygen should beapplied and an electrocardiogram obtained. Peripheral vertigo After supportive care has been initiated, theemergency physician should determine whetheror not the patient has BPV , the most commoncause of vertigo. This is based on characteristichistorical features and a positive Hallpike test. The Epley (canalith repositioning) maneuver Patients with BPV should have the modified Epley maneuver (Figure 18.5) performed as fol-lows: the patient's head is turned 45\u00b0 to the sidecausing symptoms (as determined by theHallpike test). The patient is guided to the supineposition with the head hanging over the edge ofthe gurney. The head is then rotated 90\u00b0 in theopposite direction with the face upwards, main-taining a dependent position. The patient is thenasked to roll onto his side while holding the headin this position. The head is then rotated so that itis facing obliquely downward, with the nose 45\u00b0below horizontal. The patient is then raised to asitting position while maintaining head rotation.Finally, the head is rotated to a central positionand moved forward 45\u00b0. Each position is held untilresolution of nystagmus occurs or for at least 30 seconds. It is not clear if the Epley maneuvershould be repeated multiple times. Epley himselfhas performed the maneuver up to 5 times (per-sonal communication). Other experts performthe maneuver only once since they feel that the particles will continu ally reintroduce themselves into the canals if the procedure is repeated. TheEpley maneuver takes approximately 2-3 minutesto perform and is done at the bedside. Patients areexpected to have their symptoms reproduced Primary Complaints 249 (b) Figure 18.3 Left cerebellar infarct. Non-enhanced head CT infarct.

Aside from the expectedreproduction of symptoms and possible vomiting, no adverse events from performing the Epleymaneuver have been reported. After the maneu-ver, patients are generally advised to stay in anupright position. Once the otoliths enter the utri-cle where they belong, they need time to reattachto the utricular macule. The time required for thisprocess is not clear, but it is generally recom-mended that at least 8 hours are needed beforethe patient can assume a supine position. Vestibular suppressants The use of vestibular suppressants is based on the sensory conflict theory . This states that when Utriculus Posterior- canal point canal Utriculus Vantage point Posterior-canal ampulla Gravity(d) Figure 18.5 Bedside Maneuver for the Treatment of a Patient with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo Affecting the Right Ear. Thepresumed position of the debris within the labyrinth during the maneuver is shown in each panel. The maneuver is athree-step procedure. First, a Dix-Hallpike test is performed with the patient's head rotated 45 degrees toward the rightear and the neck slightly extended with the chin pointed slightly upward. This position results in the patient's headhanging to the right (Panel A). Once the vertigo and nystagmus provoked by the Dix-Hallpike test cease, the patient'shead is rotated about the rostral-caudal body axis until the left ear is down (Panel B). Then the head and body arefurther rotated until the head is face down (Panel C). The vertex of the head is kept tilted downward throughout therotation. The maneuver usually provokes brief vertigo. The patient should be kept in the final, face-down position forabout 10 to 15 seconds. With the head kept turned toward the left shoulder, the patient is brought into the seatedposition (Panel D). Once the patient is upright, the head is tilted so that the chin is pointed slightly downward.

All rights reserved.Primary Complaints 251Dizziness and vertigothere is a mismatch of information from any of the three main sensory inputs (vestibular, visual,and proprioceptive), nausea and emesis result inthe acute phase, but habituation occurs overtime. This mismatch of information is comparedto learned prior stimuli. This process is thoughtto be mediated by three or four neurotransmit-ters: gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), acetyl-choline, histamine and serotonin. Benzodiazepineswork by preventing the mismatched informationfrom being compared to prior learned stimuli.However, many experts avoid using benzodi-azepines since they prevent the process ofvestibular rehabilitation. Anticholinergics workby decreasing the signal-size conflict, and arethought to be the most useful agents. However,atropine is rarely used due to its serious sideeffects, and scopolamine has an onset of severalhours, limiting its use in the ED. Antihistaminicsand antiserotonergics block the emesis response.These promethazine (Phenergan) many to be the best medication for theacutely symptomatic patient experiencing vertigo. Central vertigo The treatment of central vertigo depends on thecause. Antiplatelet agents should be started inconsultation with a neurologist. Near-syncope For near-syncope due to orthostatic hypotension,removal of offending medications or correction of volume depletion will often be therapeutic. Inpatients with autonomic insufficiency, increasedsalt intake can increase blood volume, and elasticstockings can prevent pooling of blood in thelower extremities. For vasovagal near-syncope,reassurance is usually all that is needed. Patients can also increase their fluid intake and avoidconditions that predispose them to hypotensionand dehydration. Near-syncope associated withimpaired cardiac output can be a serious warn-ing sign. Cardiac dysrhythmia managementdepends on the actual rhythm, and many patientscan be helped with the insertion of a pacemakereven if the diseased heart cannot be treated.Hyperventilation-induced near-syncope shouldbe treated by educating and reassuring the patientthat this is a benign disorder. If associated withpanic disorder, pharmacologic treatment (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors) may be considered after dis- cussion with the patient's primary care physician. Disequilibrium For disequilibrium, gait and balance training maybe beneficial for those patients without cerebellarlesions. Indeed, a cane or walker often helps mostpatients. Patients with alcoholic cerebellar degen-eration may show improvement following theirdiscontinuation of alcohol consumption. Parkin-son's disease may be improved with L-DOPA. Hydrocephalus-induced disequilibrium can bereversed with shunt placement. Psychophysiologic dizziness For psychophysiologic dizziness, supportivepsychotherapy in addition to medications maybe helpful. Medications include benzodiazepines,tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors. These medications should be started only after consultation with the patient's primary care physician or specialist. Special patients Pediatric Children rarely complain of dizziness. Whenthey do, they present with similar vestibular andnon-vestibular problems as adults. Otitis mediaand follow a viral infec tion, and usually occurs in children under the age of 6 years. Infection or volume depletion may beimportant clues to the diagnosis. Disequilibriumin a young person suggests neurologic disease.Also, near-syncope in a young athlete who isexercising may indicate serious cardiac disease,such as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyop-athy or aortic stenosis. Elderly Dizziness becomes more common in the elderly,which can result in falls causing hip fracturesand intracerebral hemorrhage. Elderly patientsare more likely to present with central causes ofvertigo, such as ischemic cerebrovascular dis-ease, and are more likely to be debilitated by symptoms of peripheral vertigo.Dizziness and vertigo Disposition Admission of patients with dizziness or vertigo should be based on the underlying etiology orassociated symptoms. Patients with peripheralvertigo may be discharged home, unless theypresent with intractable vomiting or vertigo thatcannot be controlled in the ED. Patients with anabnormal neurologic examination or those withincreased suspicion for a serious neurologiccause should have a formal neurologic consulta-tion or be admitted for observation. Similarly,patients in whom cardiac dysrhythmias are alikely cause should be admitted for observationand cardiac monitoring. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths A detailed neurologic examination is important in differentiating central from peripheral vertigo. Since thecerebellovestibular nuclei are tightly packedwith other tracts in the brainstem, any lesionthat affects these nuclei will likely affectothers as well. The Hallpike test should be performed inpatients who present with vertigo, but notrapidly. Gently guide the patient into the head-hanging position. It is important to differentiate BPV fromother causes of peripheral vertigo, such asvestibular neuritis, since the Epleymaneuver only works for BPV . A chief complaint of dizziness should not result in the knee-jerk reflex to prescribe meclizine. Although meclizine is effective inmany cases of vertigo, G, Hill MA.

It prompts over 30 millionphysician visits per year. By the third year of life,80% of the population will have complained ofotalgia at least once. Though many conditionsmay cause ear pain, otitis media (OM) is by far themost common diagnosis, especially in the pedi-atric population. The potential for serious causesof otalgia, such as malignant otitis externa (OE)and mastoiditis, underscore the need for early andaccurate diagnosis and treatment. Anatomic essentials The anatomic ear may be divided into three dis-tinct sections: external, middle and inner (Figure19.1). The external ear , consisting of the auricle (pinna) and the external auditory canal (EAC),originates at the pinna and ends at the tympanicmembrane (TM). The middle ear is an air- containing cavity in the petrous temporal bonethat houses three auditory ossicles: the malleus,incus and stapes. Though the middle ear is sep-arated from the outer ear by the TM, it connectsanteriorly with the nasopharynx via theeustachian tube, and posteriorly with the mas-toid air cells. The inner ear includes the cochlea, which contains the auditory receptors, andvestibular labyrinth, which contains the balancereceptors. Sensory innervation of the ear is derived from branches of cranial nerves (CNs) V ,VII, IX and X as well as I, II and III. Primary otalgia (Table 19.1) is ear pain that results from structures directly within or adjacent to the anatomic ear. OM and OE are the mostcommon causes of primary otalgia. The development of OM is thought to be asso- ciated with dysfunction of the eustachian tube.The eustachian tube protects the middle ear from19 Ear pain, nosebleed and throat pain (ENT) EAR PAIN Gregory H. Gilbert, 19.1 Ear anatomy.Ear pain 254 Primary Complaintsnasopharyngeal secretions, allows drainage of middle ear secretions, and helps equilibrate airpressure in the middle ear. Eustachian tube dysfunction may trap fluid, secretions and bacteriawithin the middle ear and result in an infection.Mechanical obstruction of the eustachian tubemay result due to localized inflammation froman upper respiratory infection (URI), allergies orhypertrophied adenoids. Functional obstructionsecondary to eustachian tube collapse may occurin young children due to anatomic differences,such as a shorter length and less cartilaginoussupport. OE results from inflammation or infection of the EAC. Prolonged exposure to moisture (i.e.,swimming) or local trauma (i.e., cotton swabs orhearing aids) can disrupt the protective outerlayer of the EAC, allowing bacterial penetrationand ensuing infection. Malignant OE, an invasivenecrotizing form, may occur in diabetics orimmunocompromised patients and result insevere neurologic sequelae or death. Not all ear pain originates from the anatomic ear. Otalgia referred from sources outside theanatomic ear (Table 19.1) occurs as a result ofshared sensory innervation by the anatomic earand other head and neck structures. Referred otalgia may arise from pathology in the parotid mastication, spine, upper gastrointestinal tract or upper respira-tory tract (Figure 19.2). Dental disorders are the Table 19.1 Causes of otalgia ( adapted from Tintinalli) Primary Referred Infection Dental -Otitis - Temporomandibular -Otitis Sinus Upper respiratory tract Thyroid glandCervical spine Figure 19.2 Sources of referred otalgia.Primary Complaints 255Ear painmost common cause of referred otalgia, espe- cially if the ear examination is normal. Elderlypatients are most likely to present with a referredcause of otalgia. History Obtaining an accurate history from young patientsmay be challenging, as a parent or guardian maybe describing the patient's symptomatology. How did the pain begin and how long have you had it? Most patients present with acute ear pain within24 hours of its onset. The ear pain may be moder-ate to severe, leading to difficulty sleeping andprompting an ED visit in the middle of the night.In one study, patients who delayed seeking ini-tial care for OM were more likely to present withcomplications. Long-standing undiagnosed earpain may represent an undiagnosed head andneck carcinoma. Describe the pain? Constant, sharp, stabbing pain with associated pressure or throbbing is typical of acute OM(AOM). The discomfort from OE may vary fromitching to severe pain. Intermittent or variable painis usually referred and may arise from the tem-poromandibular joint (TMJ) or teeth. A suddendecrease in pain associated with discharge from theear is typical of TM rupture. Pediatric patients maypull at their ears rather than complain of ear pain. What makes the pain better or worse? Pain exacerbated by eating or chewing may be referred from the TMJ or teeth. AOM is typic-ally worsened with recumbent position. The discomfort from OE is often aggravated bymanipulation of the tragus or ear. How is your hearing? Patients may describe hearing loss, muffled hear- ing, popping or crunching sounds. Hearing loss orchanges may accompany OM, OE, foreign bodies(FBs) and cerumen impaction. Any ear discharge? Otorrhea (discharge from the ear) may occur with a ruptured TM, OE or FB. The dischargemay be serosanguinous or purulent. Pain typi-cally precedes otorrhea in OM, whereas in OE it accompanies the drainage. Chronic ear painand drainage may represent mastoiditis or acholesteatoma. Any recent travel or trauma? Diving or recent air travel could lead to TM per- foration from barotrauma. A history of swimmingoften accompanies OE. A direct blow to the side ofthe head or noise trauma can also cause TM perfor-ation. The use of a Q-tip to clean the ear canal canresult in damage to the external auditory meatus or TM. A whiplash injury or arthritis of the cervicalspine can lead to referred otalgia. Associated symptoms General Ask about fussiness, lethargy, fever and URI. While adults and older children can articulate ear pain, infants and toddlers may cry, fuss or refuse food.Very few patients with OM will have a fever greater than 40\u00b0C. In these patients, considera-tion should be given to other etiologies of earpain, such as OE, trauma, FBs, mastoiditis,meningitis or an abscess. In one prospectivestudy, nearly all patients with OM had ear pain,decreased hearing and URI symptoms, but only9% of these patients had fever. Head and neck Ask about headache, sinus problems, dizziness, brux- ism, difficulty swallowing and changes in speech. As otalgia may be referred, a complete review of head and neck symptoms is imperative.Headache may occur with sinusitis, mastoiditisand malignant OE. Headache can also accom-pany complications of these conditions, such asmeningitis, brain abscess and cavernous sinusthrombosis. The presence of dizziness or tinnitussuggests inner ear involvement. Patients whogrind their teeth in the middle of the night (brux-ism) are more likely to have TMJ syndrome or adental problem. Difficulty swallowing and speak-ing can hint that the pain is referred from a retropharyngeal or peritonsillar abscess, or pos- sibly a with cervicofacial pain syndromes likemyalgias, neuralgias or arthritis may have otalgia.Children diagnosed with AOM by 1 year of age are more likely to have recurrences, with 33% ofpatients getting five or more episodes by the age of 6 years. Previous surgery such as myringotomyor tympanostomy tube placement usually indi-cates either a history of OM with a serious compli-cation or frequent recurrences unresponsive toantibiotic therapy. Patients with allergies also are at increased risk for both sinusitis and AOM; the same is true with craniofacial abnormalities seen inDown's syndrome or cleft palate. A history ofsinus problems can suggest a source of the otalgia.Immunocompromised patients and diabetics areat significant risk for developing malignant OE. Medications Patients taking medications containing acet-aminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs (NSAIDs) for their ear pain may notexhibit a fever. Symptomatic patients with OMwho are currently taking antibiotics may requirea second-line agent due to penicillin-resistantStreptococcus pneumoniae . Social Apositive correlation exists between smoking and OM. Studies reveal a 2- to 4-fold increase inOM when exposed to second-hand smoke.Smoking also increases the risk of getting sinus-itis and cancer of the larynx, both which maycause referred otalgia. Children who attendgroup day care are at a 2.5-fold increased risk for OM, while breastfed infants have 13% fewerear infections. Like viruses and the commoncold, ear infections are seasonal and tend tooccur more frequently in the winter and earlyspring. Physical examination While the history helps establish the problem, acareful physical examination may identify thediagnosis. General appearance The importance of assessing the general appear-ance of a pediatric patient cannot be overempha-sized. A toxic-appearing child with alteredmental status or lethargy merits consideration ofsepsis and meningitis, even if the examinationreveals OM. Vital signs Afever can occur with AOM, but it is seldom greater than 40\u00b0C. Tachycardia is commonly dueto fever and dehydration. For every degree (inCelsius) of temperature elevation, expect anincrease in the pulse of about 10 beats/minute. Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat Acomplete head, eye, ear, nose and throat (HEENT) examination is essential to properassessment of the patient with otalgia. Possibleserious etiologies identified on the ossicles, retropharyngeal abscess,meningitis, and malignant OE. Head and face The sinuses should be examined to assess for the possibility of sinusitis. The temporal arteryshould be palpated, as temporal arteritis is atreatable cause of referred otalgia. scalp or neckinfections. The submandibular, submaxillaryand parotid glands should also be inspected An infection, tumor or salivary stoneaffecting the parotid gland, which lies just anterior to the ear, could lead to otalgia.

The EAC should be examined for signs of inflammation or the presence of a FB.The presence of erythema or edema of the canal,with ear pain reproduced by pulling on the auricleor tragus, signifies OE. Tympanic membrane straightens the external auditory canal and facil-itates visualization of the TM. The light reflex,color, translucency and bony landmarks of theTM should be noted. Comparison with the otherear may be helpful. The normal TM is shiny andtranslucent (Figure 19.5). Erythema may be pres- ent with OM, but also crying or fever.

The presenceof a tympanostomy tube may lead to decreasedTM mobility, altered landmarks, opacity anddullness, even in the absence of infection. Adefect in the TM suggests perforation (Figure19.8), while a white mass behind the TM may bea cholesteatoma. Pneumatic otoscopy Following visualization of the TM with the oto- scope, air can be insufflated into the canal usinga pneumatic bulb. The normal TM should beslightly mobile with insufflation. The lack of TMmobility highly suggests a middle ear effusion,though mobility may also be reduced from mid-dle ear adhesions, TM perforation or eustachiantube dysfunction. An erythe-matous eardrum which has lost its bony land-marks is very predictive of AOM (Figure 19.9).

In this procedure, the patient pinches thenose, gently blows without opening the mouth(cheeks puffing out is okay) and then swallows.Using this technique, the normal TM shouldmove outward initially and then inward withswallowing. Hearing Hearing can be evaluated in a cooperative patient, but rarely in the young pediatric patient. Hearingcanbe measured grossly or using the Weber and Rinne tests. The Weber test is performed by plac- ing the base of vibrating tuning fork on the mid-dle of the forehead, equidistant from the ears.Hearing the tone louder in one ear suggestseither conductive hearing loss in that ear or sen-sorineural hearing loss in the opposite ear.Plugging your ear with a finger (to simulate con-ductive hearing loss) and performing the testwill demonstrate this finding. The Rinne test is performed by alternating placement of a vibrat-ing tuning fork directly on the patient's mastoidprocess (bone conduction) and in front of thepatient's ear (air conduction). Hearing the tonelouder in front of the ear is a positive Rinne test,indicating normal hearing or sensorineural hear-ing loss. Hearing the tone louder with the tuningfork against the mastoid is a negative Rinne test and indicates conductive hearing loss in that ear. Mouth and throat Since dental pain is the most common cause of referred otalgia, the teeth should be carefully examined for dental caries, abscess, impactedmolars or poorly-fitting dentures. Dental maloc-clusion referred ear pain from masticator musclespasm. The TMJ should be assessed for clicking,popping and tenderness consistent with TMJsyndrome. Assess ryngeal abscess, mass. Neck The neck should be evaluated for meningealsigns which must not be missed. Also assess theneck for musculoskeletal disorders, lymph nodeand thyroid enlargement, or other masses or ten-derness. Flexion of the neck may increase otalgiadue to degenerative joint disease. Cranial nerves Cranial nerve VII dysfunction and resultingfacial paralysis may occur in patients withRamsay-Hunt syndrome, mastoiditis or malig-nant OE.

In patients with suspectedmalignant OE, cultures of the purulent dischargemay aid pathogen identification and guide anti-biotic therapy. Computerized tomography (CT)and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) areindicated to delineate the extent of infection.Patients without an obvious source for otalgia onphysical examination may require a CT scan of thehead, face or neck to determine the etiology.Thyroid function tests or an erythrocyte sedimen-tation rate (ESR) may be helpful if thyroiditis ortemporal arteritis is suspected. Panorex or dentalX-rays may be helpful if suspicion exists for amandibular or dental etiology. General treatment principles Pain relief While ibuprofen or acetaminophen may be adequate for some patients, others may require ashort course of narcotic analgesia. A topical anesthetic like auralgan (antipyrine/benzocaine)may be beneficial in patients with primary otalgiaand an intact TM. Viscous lidocaine or benadrylelixir can be gargled to anesthetize the throat andpossibly localize referred otalgia to the oropharynx. Otitis media Antibiotics Antibiotics are commonly used to treat AOM. Since the advent of antibiotic therapy for AOM, therate of complications and deaths from AOM hasdropped dramatically. first-line antimicrobialagent for AOM is typically amoxicillin, given ithas few side effects and reasonable efficacy. Theuse of higher dose amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/day) ismore effective against drug-resistant pneumococ-cus; this therapy should be considered in chil-dren who have received antibiotics in the past 3months, are less than 2 years of age, or are in daycare. In penicillin-allergic patients, to improve after 72 hours of antibiotictherapy is considered a treatment failure. ForTable 19.3 Antibiotic choices for acute otitis media Ear pain 262 Primary Complaintspatients who fail to respond to initial amoxicillin therapy, the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention recommend amoxicillin/clavulanate,cefuroxime axetil or intramuscular ceftriaxone(Table 19.3). The need for antibiotic therapy in uncompli- cated AOM is controversial. The over-prescriptionof antibiotics for AOM and emergence of bacter-ial resistance to commonly-used antibiotics hasheightened the urgency to reduce unnecessaryantibiotic use. Recent data suggest a lack of benefitto antibiotic treatment in children with uncom-plicated OM (the absence of fever and vomiting).The practice of holding antibiotic therapy andwatchful waiting is common in Europe and gain-ing acceptance in the US. Reliable patients withadequate access to follow-up care are given asafety-net antibiotic prescription (SNAP) to befilled only if their symptoms do not resolve dur-ing the first 48 hours. During this period ofobservation, patients are managed with oral anal-gesics and topical otic anesthetic drops. Other therapy The use of antihistamines, decongestants or ster- oids provides no obvious benefit for patients with AOM. Otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation OM with perforation of the TM is treated similarly to AOM. Since the purulent discharge associatedwith perforation may result in an associated OE,patients are also commonly treated with a topicaleardrops containing a steroid-antibiotic suspen-sion, such as corticosporin-HC otic or corticosporinophthalmic drops. Patients should avoid swim-ming and diving until the 3 months-2 years: 10 days /H110222 years: 20-25 mg/kg PO BID for 10 days (Alt: BID for 5 days; Max: 875 mg/dose) Adults: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxisole Pediatrics: /H110222 months: 0.5 ml susp/kg days; Max: 20 ml susp/dose Adults: 1 QD days 2-5; Max: 500 mg/day Adults: 500 mg PO day 1, 250 mg PO QD days 2-5 (Alt: 500 mg PO QD for 3 days) Clarithromycin Pediatrics: 7.5 mg/kg PO BID for 10 days; Max: 1 g/day Adults: 500 mg PO BID for 7-14 days Second line DosageAmoxicillin-clavulanate Dose based on amoxicillin component Pediatrics: /H110213 months: 1800 mg/day Adults: 875 mg days Cefuroxime Pediatrics: 10-15 of otitis externa During bathing, the placement of a petroleum jelly-impregnated cotton ball in the outer ear mayprevent the entry of water into the EAC. Otitis externa The treatment of OE begins with cleansing theexternal canal through gentle irrigation and suc-tioning. Though irrigation may be performed withtap water, saline or Burrow's solution, acetic acidhas the added benefit of having antifungal andantibacterial properties. Cleansing is followed bytreatment with topical antibiotic-steroid otic drops(Table 19.4). In cases where the canal is occludedby edema, the careful placement of a cotton wickfacilitates the delivery of medicine throughout theentire ear canal. Consider systemic antibiotics ifcellulitis or systemic signs are present. Foreign bodies Approaches used for FB removal from the earinclude irrigation, suction, direct instrumentationand cyanoacrylate (superglue). The preferredapproach reflects the type of FB, available equip-ment and the physician's proficiency. Warm waterirrigation is a simple, noninvasive approach forpatients with an intact TM. Avoid irrigation if thesuspected FB is made of organic material, as expan-sion of the object following contact with water maycomplicate its removal. For insects within the canal,mineral oil or viscous lidocaine is usually appliedto immobilize and kill the insect. Lidocaine has theadded benefit of anesthetizing the canal and TM,making extraction less painful. Following theremoval of any FB, prophylactic antibiotics may be necessary to prevent OE. If removal of the FB can-not be achieved in the ED, ear, nose and throat(ENT) referral within 24 hours is necessary. Special patients Immune compromised Diabetics and immunocompromised patients areat increased risk for malignant OE, a severe necro-tizing infection that originates in the ear canal. As the infection spreads to adjacent structures, itmay become destructive and life-threatening. Thecausative agent usu-ally administered for 4-8 weeks, and surgicaldebridement may be required. Disposition Discharge The vast majority of patients with otalgia are discharged home with an excellent prognosis.Patients who require subspecialty consultationinclude those suffering from malignant OE or mas-toiditis, and those with worrisome complaints orName Components Dosage VoSol Acetic acid and propylene glycol 5 otic TID/QID 3-5 gtts solution BID times a day.Ear pain 264 Primary Complaintsfindings such as severe pain, neurologic deficits, bloody discharge, hearing loss and vertigo. Most cases of AOM should improve within 48-72 hours. If symptoms persist, patients shouldbe reevaluated for complications or possible treat-ment failure. Patients with an uncomplicated AOMshould be reexamined in 2-3 weeks to ensure reso-lution of their middle ear effusion. Follow-up withENT should be arranged for patients with frequentear infections, craniofacial abnormalities or multi-ple treatment failures. Patients with otalgia from anundetermined source need follow-up and furtherevaluation, as an occult tumor may be responsible. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths The most common cause of otalgia is OM. Pain typically precedes otorrhea in OM; it accompanies the drainage in OE. Few patients with OM have very hightemperatures. A n immobile, bulging red eardrum that has lost its bony landmarks is consistent with AOM. The presence of ear pain reproduced bypulling on the tragus or auricle is likelycaused by OE. Not all discharge from an ear canal is due to OE. Not all pain originates from the anatomic ear. Dental pain is the most common cause ofreferred otalgia. Not all patients with OM need immediateantibiotics. Placement of a wick may aid the treatment ofa patient with canal occlusion from OE. OE in an immunocompromised considered malignant OE untilproven otherwise. References 1.Cummings CW, et al. (ed.). Otolaryngology: Head and Neck Surgery ,3rd ed., Mosby, 1998.2.Hamilton GC (ed.).

There istypically a bimodal distribution, with patientscommonly 2-10 or 50-80 years of age. Although arelatively small percentage (6-10%) of patients actually seek medical attention, epistaxis affectsone out of every seven persons in their lifetime, or5-15% of the population per year. Though deathdoes occur, it is rare. Surprisingly, one studyshowed that only a third of emergency personnelin one ED were familiar with basic first aid forepistaxis. Anatomic essentials Management of epistaxis requires a basic under-standing of the nasal blood supply (Figure 19.10).The nasal circulation is derived from branches ofthe internal and external carotid arteries. Thevascular nature of the nose is essential for itsincredible heating and humidification require-ments. To further facilitate this function, the vasculature runs just under the mucosa (not thesquamous layer), leaving vessels more exposedand at risk for damage. These vessels spread outwithin this mucosal layer to form an anastomoticmeshwork, artificially divided into anterior andposterior segments. Anterior epistaxis originates from the anterior network of vessels, located in the fleshy part ofthe nose called Little's area or Kiesselbach'splexus. This collection of vessels is supplied bythe anterior ethmoidal, greater palatine, septalbranch of the superior labial, and sphenopalatinearteries. Ninety percent of nosebleeds originatefrom this part of the nose. Examining the nasalseptum typically reveals the source in anteriornosebleeds. Posterior epistaxis occurs in 10% of nosebleeds. Posterior hemorrhage may not be directly visual-ized, and can be difficult to treat since it occurs ina noncompressible part of the nose. A network ofvessels called Woodruff's plexus supplied by thesphenopalatine, posterior ethmoidal and arteries is the most common site of posterior venous bleeds. In the event of an arterial bleed, itis most likely from the sphenopalatine artery.Table 19.5 provides a summary of information about anterior and posterior epistaxis.NOSEBLEED Gregory H. Gilbert, MD Anterior ethmoid artery the nasal septum.Nosebleed 266 Primary ComplaintsHistory Management of the airway, breathing and circula- tion (ABCs) and hemorrhage control take prece-dence over obtaining a complete history. Thefollowing information should be obtained once theABCs are secured and the bleeding is controlled. How did this begin? Attempt to determine what precipitated the epi- staxis. Was it traumatic or spontaneous? The mostcommon causes of epistaxis include epistaxisdigitorum (nose picking), foreign bodies (FBs),and dry air and upper respiratory infection (URI)during the winter months. Think of nasal FBs inchildren, institutionalized elderly and patientswith developmental delay. Consult ear, nose andthroat (ENT) early if there has been recent nasalsurgery. Traumatic epistaxis may be associatedwith other serious facial injuries. Which side did it begin on? Bleeding from one naris suggests an anterior nosebleed, while bleeding from both sides usu-ally represents a posterior source. However,blood from a brisk anterior nosebleed can refluxinto the unaffected side via the posteriorchoanae, simulating posterior epistaxis. How severe has it been? Details regarding the amount of bleeding can be helpful to determine the amount of blood lossthat has occurred. This is frequently embellished.Much more accurate predictors of blood loss arethe patient's vital signs, symptoms, and physicalsigns.How did you attempt to stop the bleeding? Direct pressure, Afrin or pledgets are common things patients try before coming to the ED.Epistaxis that persists despite these efforts is gen-erally more difficult to treat. Have you ever had this before? Nosebleeds that recur should raise concern for intranasal pathology, such as a deviated septumand primary or secondary tumors. This warrantsENT referral and should trigger questions abouteasy bruising or bleeding, which may suggestcoagulopathy. Intranasal pathology predisposesthe patient to nosebleeds because of friable vesselsand/or engorgement. This is also seen in patientswith hypertension, congestive heart failure(CHF), pregnancy or frequent sneezing. Ask thepatient about recent ED visits for bleeding andhow the bleeding was treated. Have you been coughing up or vomiting blood? Massive epistaxis may be initially confused withhemoptysis or hematemesis. In cases of epistaxiswithout blood clearly dripping from the nose,identification of bleeding from the posteriornasopharynx confirms the diagnosis. Past medical It is important to ask about underlying medicalconditions such as bleeding disorders or blooddyscrasias (hemophilia, von Willebrand's disease,Osler-Weber-Rendu disease or thrombocytope-nia). Ask about easy br uising or bleeding, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), liver or kidneyTable 19.5 Summary of historical and examination distinctions between anterior and posterior epistaxis Anterior Posterior History Presence of an inciting event Blood flowing down back of throat Recent use of agents that promote Started in both nares vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa Seen more frequently in the elderly population Insertion of a foreign body Tends to be more severe Recent cold, flu or allergies Patient unable to control Pediatric age group History of angiofibroma in young males Unilateral Squamous cell carcinoma in Asians Physical Site of bleeding directly visualized Cannot identify anterior site of bleeding examination Bleeding from one nostril Bleeding from both nares Foreign body identified Blood continues to trickle down throat despite adequate anterior packPrimary Complaints 267Nosebleeddisease and cancer, as these patients may have drug use, thrombocytopenia, platelet disordersor splenomegaly predisposing them to bleeding. Past surgical Has the patient had prior nasal surgery? Medications It is important to ask about medications that couldmake bleeding more likely or treatment more dif-ficult. These include platelet inhibitors like aspirin,dipyridamole and non-steroidal anti-inflamma-tory drugs (NSAIDs), or anticoagulants like war-farin and heparin. The social history shouldinclude questions about alcohol abuse or cocaineinsufflation, as both may contribute to or exacer-bate bleeding. Physical examination Aquick look at the patient should make it obvi- ous whether the patient is stable or ill. A focusedphysical examination should look at the followingitems. General appearance and skin Apale, diaphoretic appearance is an ominous sign. The patient has either lost a large amount ofblood, or does not like the sight of it. In eithercase, placing the patient supine on a gurney willprevent serious injury should the patient loseconsciousness. Ecchymosis, refill suggests significantblood loss.Vital signs It is important to check the blood pressure andpulse rate. Abnormalities suggesting significantblood loss include hypotension, tachycardia orsymptomatic blood pressure changes fromsupine to standing, and should prompt establish-ment of intravenous (IV) access and administrationof fluid. Blood should be drawn for laboratorystudies in this situation. Although hypertensionhas never been shown to cause epistaxis, it canworsen bleeding when present. Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat Acomplete head, eye, ear, nose and throat (HEENT) examination should be performed in allpatients with epistaxis. Signs of basilar skull frac-ture (raccoon sign, hemotympanumor cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea) com-plicate therapy, as devices introduced throughthe nares (i.e., intranasal balloon device) are at riskfor perforating the cribriform plate and enteringthe cranium. Assess for tenderness and stabilityof the maxilla and other facial bones to help iden-tify Le Fort or orbital wall fractures. Nose The key to successful examination of the nose is preparation. Prior to the nasal examination, assem-ble the proper items for examination, stabilizationand treatment (Table 19.6). First, have the patient blow his nose to clear the nasopharynx, even if the bleeding has stopped. Athorough nasal examination should then be performed. A nasal speculum assists with thistask (Figure 19.11). Attempt to locate the source ofbleeding. Ninety percent of nosebleeds have avisible source, and car eful examination of the nasal septum will reveal a friable vessel. If trauma was the cause, it is important to examine the nasal Examination Stabilization Treatment Protective eyewear or Merocel spongeKleenex or gauzeTable 19.6 Suggested equipment for the evaluation and treatment of epistaxisseptum to exclude septal hematoma, and the facial bones to exclude fracture. An untreated septalhematoma can lead to an abscess or avascularnecrosis of the septum. If the bleeding source is notvisible on nasal examination, it may be from theposterior circulation. Other findings consistentwith posterior epistaxis include bleeding from bothnares and hemorrhage into the posterior pharynx.Controlling bleeding in these patients may beextremely difficult. Consider confounding factorslike coagulopathy if bleeding persists cautery and packing. Consultationwith ENT and/or hematology may be necessary inthese patients. Nasal examination should look fornasal pathology, such as FBs, perforated or devi-ated septum, nasal masses or engorged vessels. Differential diagnosis Table 19.7 provides several etiologies of epistaxis. Nosebleed 268 Primary Complaints Figure 19.11 Use of a nasal speculum to examine the nose. Traumatic or mechanical Epistaxis digitorum (nose picking) Congenital or acquired nasal defects Direct blow (with or without fracture) FB (demented, psychiatric, intentional, children) Desiccation (low humidity household, winter, supplemental oxygen) Infections/inflammation (allergic or septal perforation, cautery) Barotrauma (abrupt changes in pressure - diving rapid altitude gain) Venous congestion (CHF , mitral stenosis, sneezing, coughing, nose blowing, Valsalva, pregnancy) Tumors (benign or malignant) Primary (nasal polyps, juvenile angiofibroma, squamous cell, paranasal sinus tumors, metastatic) Secondary (thrombocytopenia due leukemia, lymphoma or chemotherapy) Predisposing factors Systemic toxins (rodenticide, plant Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu folic acid, vitamin K) Hepatic disease (alcoholism, hepatitis) Renal nephritis, Blood 269Nosebleed Diagnostic testing Laboratory studies Laboratory studies are not necessary in most cases of epistaxis. Complete blood count If there has been a significant amount of blood loss, easy bruising, recurrent epistaxis, history ofplatelet disorder, cancer or recent chemotherapy,a CBC should be checked. If the blood loss wassignificant enough to order a CBC, then a type and screen should also be ordered. Partial thromboplastin, Partial thromboplastin time, International Normalized Ratio These tests are helpful in anticoagulated patients. They may also be helpful in patients with liverdisease. Bleeding time This test determines if the patient is able to clot normally. An abnormal bleeding time can occureven if the International Normalized Ratio (INR)is normal and could help explain difficulties con-trolling epistaxis. Radiologic studies In the patient with significant facial trauma, com-puterized tomography (CT) of the facial bones isbest to assess the types of fractures present. General treatment principles As stated earlier, the ABCs are the first priority. If the bleeding is so severe that the airway andbreathing are compromised, intubation shouldoccur along with placement of an epistaxis bal-loon. While the majority of nosebleeds are stable,patients with significant blood loss need to beplaced on a gurney. An attempt to expel all clotsfrom the nose should be performed first, becausefibrinolysis of the existing clot can lead to contin-ued bleeding. This will also enable the clinicianto see the amount of blood and from which nostrilthe bleeding is occurring.Direct pressure Direct pressure is the first step in controlling epi-staxis. With the patient seated, assuming he cantolerate it, tilt the head slightly forward in thesniffing position. The fleshy part of the nose issqueezed between the thumb and a flexed indexfinger (Figure 19.12). It should look like thepatient's nose is in a fist. Have the patient holdpressure for 10-15 minutes. During this time,gather the supplies mentioned previously (Table19.6) and gown the patient. Dress in appropriateattire, adhering to universal precautions. Thisincludes a gown, eyewear, possibly a facemask or shield, and gloves. A headlamp will help with visualization, and a basin should be placedbelow the patient's chin. Set up a suction devicewith a Yankauer or Frazier tip. If bleeding persists after withdrawing direct pressure, the use of pledgets or sprays may arrestthe bleeding. The pledget should first be soakedin a lidocaine with epinephrine solution orcocaine and then inserted into the nasal passage(Table 19.8). Be sure to reapply direct pressure.The use of vasoconstrictive agents without ananesthetic is inadequate, as interventions to haltthe bleeding will irritate the exquisitely sensitivenasal mucosa. Though mayalso mucosa to Figure 19.12 Direct pressure.absorb more agent than spraying alone. Heavy bleeding that persists after three attempts withdirect pressure and pledget insertion requiresnasal packing. However, if bleeding has slowedto an ooze or stopped, proceed with inspection ofthe nasal cavity. The effects of these agents aretemporary, so bleeding is likely to recur. Usingthe nasal speculum, and identify ableeding source. Cautery Silver nitrate sticks can be used for cautery ifthere is no active bleeding. They are applied tothe vessel or friable mucosa for up to 20 seconds.Cauterize in a rolling motion peripherally to cen-trally and superior to inferior to avoid renderingthe stick ineffective with blood. Beware of causingseptal perforation with prolonged or overzealoususe. Septal necrosis and perforation can also occurwith multiple applications to both sides of theseptum, so use great care. Cautery has little valuein trauma patients, nor should it be attempted ifthe cause of epistaxis is thought to be cancerous.Persistent bleeding can be treated with Gelfoamor a similar thrombogenic substance. Thermal orelectrocautery is extremely difficult and fraught with iatrogenic injury; these modalities are bestleft to the ENT specialist. Packing Anterior Packing is the next step. Traditionally this was done with Vaseline gauze and forceps. The pack-ing was placed along the floor of the nasal cavity,front to back, back to front, until the entire cavitywas filled. This is a difficult, time-consumingprocess, but when done correctly provides excel-lent hemostasis. More commonly used devicesinclude nasal tampons (Figure 19.13) or intranasalballoons. Tampons are typically lubricated withantibacterial ointment prior to insertion. Uponcontact with fluid, the tampon expands. One technique uses phenyle phrine spray to induce tampon expansion by spraying it on either side.Intranasal balloon catheters should be inserted with water-based lubricants. Petroleum productscan cause degradation of the balloon and possiblerupture. There are two types of balloons: anterior and anterior/posterior. Tamponade should beginwith the anterior balloon since placement of the anterior/posterior balloon usually requires hospital admission. Following packing, the oropharynx is visualized and inspected for furtherbleeding. Its presence implies either inadequateanterior packing or a posterior source. Posterior If these methods fail and bleeding persists, the source of bleeding is likely posterior. Traditionallya posterior pack was performed with silk suturesattached to rolled gauze. This was drawn upthrough the mouth into the posterior pharynx.Then bilateral anterior packs were placed. Quicker,more comfortable methods have been developed.Treatment can be done with either a 12-16 French Foley catheter with a 30-ml balloon (the distal tipshould be cut off for patient comfort) or the ante-rior/posterior nasal balloon (Figure 19.14). Both are inserted through the naris into the posteriornasal cavity. The balloon is filled with saline andchecked prior to insertion for integrity. Followingplacement, it is pulled into the posterior choana.Care should be taken not to overfill the balloon, Nosebleed 270 Primary Complaints Figure 19.13 Merocel or neosynephrine with 4% lidocaine(lidocaine's toxic dose is 4 mg/kg) Epinephrine 0.25 ml of 1 : 1000 concentrationmixed with 20 ml of 4% lidocaine Cocaine (4%) (do not exceed 2-3 mg/kg in adults) Note :4% is equal to 40 mg/ml.Primary Complaints 271Nosebleed as pressure necrosis or septal damage may occur. This should stop bleeding from the posteriorpharynx. Once this has occurred, the anterior balloon may be filled with fluid or an anterior pack placed using one of the above-mentionedmethods. Posterior packs may induce suppres-sion of the respiratory drive and hypoxia. Due tothe considerable morbidity and mortality associ-ated with posterior packs, ENT consultation andadmission are recommended. Patients receivingany nasal packing are at significant risk forsinusitis and possibly toxic shock syndrome. Forthis reason, antibiotics should be prescribed forall posterior packs and significant anterior packs. (Table 19.9). Furthermore, appropriate analgesiashould be considered for posterior packs, as these are often very painful for patients.Special patients Elderly Geriatric patients tend to have multiple medicalproblems; careful review of the patient's medicalhistory and medications may reveal the cause ofthe epistaxis. Liver or renal disease, CHF, hyper-tension, cancer, other coagulopathies, or the useof warfarin or aspirin may play a role in thepatient's epistaxis and make it difficult to control. Pediatric Most pediatric patients require only direct pres-sure to control the bleeding. If packing is required,ENT consultation is recommended, as pediatricpatients tend to be uncooperative and may needsedation in the operating room. It is especiallyimportant to consider the possibility of nasal FB asthe cause of bleeding in this population. Immune compromised Universal precautions are extremely importantin this situation since the clinician is dealing withblood. Patients with HIV may have thrombo-cytopenia, platelet disorders, splenomegaly ordrug use predisposing them to bleeding. Disposition Ear, nose and throat consultation Five to ten percent of ED cases of epistaxisrequire ENT consultation or admission, particu- larly if the clinician is unable to control the bleed-ing. Patients with a posterior packing often need tobe admitted to ENT due to increased morbidityand mortality. Pediatric patients who are unco-operative also require ENT consultation. Figure 19.14 Anterior/posterior nasal balloon. Table 19.9 Prophylactic antibiotic options for epistaxis with packing Antibiotic 5-day course Adult dose Pediatric dose PO BID /H110222 months: 0.5 ml susp/kg PO BID (max 20 three times a day.Nosebleed 272 Primary ComplaintsDischarge The majority of patients presenting with epistaxis will be discharged. All patients presenting to theED with epistaxis need ENT referral for evalua-tion of possible intranasal pathology. Patientswith high risk (posterior or significant anterior)nasal packing need to be placed on antibiotics toprevent sinusitis and reduce the risk of toxicshock syndrome. They require follow-up withENT in 48-72 hours for removal of the packingand further evaluation of the nasal mucosa. Ifbleeding recurs prior to the ENT evaluation, thepatient should attempt direct pressure two orthree times for 10-15 minutes. Patients withbleeding around nasal packing should return tothe ED. In dry, cold months, patients withoutpacking may benefit from saline spray, humidi-fiers and petroleum jelly applied intranasallyonce or twice a day. Patients should be instructedto avoid blowing or picking their nose, strainingor participating in strenuous activities. Theyshould sneeze with their mouths open. Patientsshould avoid aspirin and NSAIDs for 3-4 days. Educating patients about prevention and management of recurrences reduces morbidity,mortality and prevents unnecessary future visits. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Direct pressure should be firmly held overthe fleshy part of the nose, not the bridge, forat least 10-15 minutes. Ice on the bridge of a nose or in the mouthmay help slow bleeding. Assuming the patient can tolerate sitting, thehead should be above the heart and in thesniffing position, nottipped back, which allows blood to run down the back of thethroat. Preparation is key to the successful treatment of epistaxis. Consider FB in young children presentingwith epistaxis.Do not waste time doing an anterior pack if aposterior source is suspected. Record the amount of fluid used to fill boththe anterior and posterior intranasalballoons. Consider admitting all patients withposterior packing. They may become hypoxicand hypercarbic due to hypoventilation andthus have increased canget bradycardic or develop dysrhythmias orcoronary ischemia. Improper packing can lead to pressurenecrosis of the columella or nasal ala. Patients who start bleeding around anteriorpacking need to be reevaluated, repacked, orhave ENT consultation. Patients with high risk nasal packing shouldbe started on antibiotics, due to an increasedrisk for sinusitis and toxic shock syndrome. References 1.Hamilton GC (ed.).

Pharyngitis isby far the most common cause of throat pain. Theetiologies, work-up and treatment of tonsillitisand pharyngitis are identical, so it is common torefer to both as pharyngitis. Viruses are the most common cause of pharyngitis, accounting for 40%of cases. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus(GABHS) accounts for up to 40% of pediatric cases,but less than 15% of adult cases of pharyngitis. Although most patients presenting with sore throat have a mild, self-limiting illness, throatpain may be the hallmark of life-threatening ill-ness. Recognizing and treating both commonand serious causes of sore throat is an essentialskill for emergency providers. Anatomic essentials The throat or pharynx is divided into three areasextending from the base of the skull to the inlet of the esophagus (Figures 19.15a and (posterior the mouth down tothe edge of the epiglottis) and hypophar-ynx (between the epiglottis and the cricoid cartil-age). Sore throat may be caused by a disorderaffecting any of these areas, as well as processesaffecting the ears, tongue, esophagus and upperthorax. Throat pain is commonly associated withear pain because cranial nerves IX and X providesensory innervation to the pharynx and larynx aswell as the ear. Deep space infections of the lower face and neck may cause sore throat. A polymicrobial cel-lulitis of the submandibular spaces of the head and neck causes Ludwig's angina. Thereare seven spaces in the neck peritonsillar, parapharyn-geal, retropharyngeal, the preverte-bral and retropharyngeal spaces). The supraglot- tic structures become infected in epiglottitis.THROAT PAIN Michelle Huston, MD Soft palate arch of Epiglottis cartilage Cricoid cartilage Nasopharynx Oropharynx Hypopharynx (b) Figure (a) Anatomy of the and (b) sagittal anatomy.Throat pain 274 Primary ComplaintsHistory Life-threatening illnesses should be ruled out in all cases of sore throat. These include deep spaceinfections, epiglottitis, foreign bodies (FBs),laryngeal trauma and burns. All of these entitiesmay cause sudden airway obstruction withasphyxia. Additionally, deep space infections maylead to carotid artery and jugular vein throm-bosis and hemorrhage, pericarditis,empyema and sepsis. Where is the located? of symptoms is suggestive of peri- tonsillitis, a cellulitis or abscess of the peritonsil-lar space. Patients with retained FBs are oftenable to describe the exact location of the pain. How long has the pain been present? If the pain has been present less than 72 hours, it is unlikely that a deep space infection is present.Asore throat of greater than 2 weeks duration in a patient over the age of 40 years should beconsidered cancer until proven otherwise. How did the symptoms begin? Sudden onset of pain during eating suggests a FB. The presence of a FB can be easily missed inchildren and those with mental illness or swal-lowing dysfunction if these patients and theircompanions are not carefully questioned.Similarly, trauma is not always mentioned with-out the examiner specifically asking. Have you had the pain before? Many patients with GABHS pharyngitis have experienced their symptoms with previousepisodes. Describe the character of the pain (quality and severity) Throat pain ranges from a sensation of scratchi- ness to severe pain. The gradual onset of a scrat-chy sensation evolving into pain is consistent witha viral infection. Any close contacts with similar symptoms? Apositive answer to this question supports either a viral or bacterial source of infection.Are there any measures that make the discomfort worse or better? Pain with swallowing (odynophagia), especially hot or acidic fluids, is seen with many causes ofthroat pain, including pharyngitis and cancer. Associated symptoms Potential airway obstruction Ask about swallowing function, drooling, voicechange, trouble breathing and apprehension.Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and theinability to swallow must be distinguished fromodynophagia, which is present in almost allpatients with sore throat. Drooling may repre-sent the inability to swallow. Voice changes mayrange from mild hoarseness to a muffled voice tocomplete aphonia. A muffled or \"hot potato\"voice is often heard with deep space neck infec-tions, and trauma, as well \"noisybreathing\" and apprehension are often reportedby patients with impending airway obstruction. Trismus Limitation of mouth opening is caused by inflammation of the muscles of mastication.Conditions that may cause trismus include someof the deep space infections of the neck andLudwig's angina. Fever Fever is associated with both viral and bacterial pharyngitis, epiglottitis and deep space infec-tions. Patients with bacterial infections, includ-ing those with epiglottitis, typically have highfevers. Upper respiratory infection Examples of upper respiratory infection (URI) are rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cough andcoryza. The combination of these symptoms andsore throat is most commonly associated withviral infections. Ear pain (otalgia) Pain radiating to the ears is common with pharyngitis and other causes of throat pain, butdoes not point to a specific etiology of sore throat.Primary Complaints 275Throat painTooth pain (odontalgia) Dental pathology and procedures may precede the development of a parapharyngeal abscess,Ludwig's angina or Vincent's angina. Headache Headache may be associated with GABHS pharyn- gitis. Although rare, the deep neck infections andGABHS pharyngitis may spread and cause mas-toiditis, cavernous sinus thrombosis or meningitis,which are all serious etiologies of headache. Neck pain Posterior or lateral neck pain in the presence of sore throat should raise suspicion for deep spaceabscess and/or meningeal spread of infection.Anterior neck pain should raise suspicion forepiglottitis or laryngeal injury. Abdominal pain Abdominal pain may be associated with GABHS pharyngitis, particularly in children. Rash Scarlet fever, which is caused by GABHS, is diag- nosed by the presence of a distinctive, diffusesand-papery red rash. Gonococcal or meningococ-cal pharyngitis may lead to disseminated rashes. Vaginal or penile discharge Ask about a history of sexually transmitted ill- nesses (STIs) and orogenital sex in sexuallyactive patients with sore throat. These patientsare at risk for gonococcal and/or Chlamydia tra- chomatis pharyngitis. Past medical Pay special attention to systemic disorders (theimmunocompromised host is at risk for oppor-tunistic infections), medications, history of aller-gic reactions, tobacco and alcohol use (increasedrisk of cancer), and vaccination history. Askabout a prior history of \"strep throat\" diagnosedby laboratory measures, and any history of rheum-aticfever or rheumatic heart disease. GABHS infection does tend to recur in these patients.Surgical history, particularly previous head orneck surgery, recent intubation, gastric tubeplacement or recent dental procedure may pre-dispose to retropharyngeal abscess or laryngealtrauma. Be aware that many patients havealready started antibiotics which may mask theclinical picture. Diptheria is now most com-monly seen in adults who lack immunization andprevious exposure to the bacteria. H. influenzae is a rare cause of epiglottitis since the initiation ofvaccination programs in 1990. Physical examination Diagnosing the cause of sore throat depends onan accurate physical assessment of the orophar-ynx and, in some cases, the nasopharynx andhypopharynx. The physical examination shouldfocus on the anatomic location of any lesions andpotential complications, especially airway obstruc-tion and systemic disease. General appearance Assess for \"toxicity\", a general impression of howill the patient appears. A patient who prefers to besitting up or standing with the neck extended andthe nose pointed toward the ceiling (\"sniffing posi-tion\") may be self-stenting their airway to avoidcomplete obstruction. General inspection duringhistory taking may reveal voice alteration and dif-ficulty swallowing with drooling. Other signs oftoxicity which require immediate attention includestridor, cyanosis, dyspnea and tachypnea. Stridor is a loud, harsh respiratory sound that results fromobstruction of the trachea or larynx. Stridor is usu-ally heard during inspiration; in severe cases ofobstruction, it may also be heard during expiration. Vital signs Fever and tachycardia are nonspecific signs, butdemonstrate a systemic impact of the illness. Oropharynx Inspection In cases of suspected epiglottitis (Figure 19.16) or retropharyngeal abscess, a complete examination of the oropharynx should be done cautiously ordeferred until reaching the operating room (OR)due to the risk of precipitating airway occlusion. Becautious in the examination of any patient assum-ing the sniffing position, in respiratory distress orwith drooling. Inability to fully open the mouthmay indicate trismus and limit the examination. If the patient appears stable, examine the oral mucosa, hard and soft palates, oropharynx, tonsil-lar pillars and tonsils by holding the tongue downwith a wooden blade. Look for erythema, exudates, pseudomembranes, swelling, petechiae (Figure19.17), lesions (such as vesicles and ulcerations)and masses. A good light source is necessary. Localanesthetic sprays (e.g., Cetacaine) and having thepatient assist by holding their own tongue downwith a piece of gauze may allow a better examina- tion in the patient with an overactive gag reflex.Having the patient say \"ahhh\" will also improve your view of the pharynx and tonsils by elevating the uvula and soft palate. Note the size, position and symmetry of the tonsils, looking especially atthe degree of airway patency. Abnormal contoursand bulges in the oropharyngeal wall may indi-cate a deep tissue infection. The oropharyngealexamination in a patient with peritonsillitis typi-cally demonstrates unilateral soft palate swellinganterior and superior to the affected swollen ton-sil, with loss of the line between the anterior ton-sillar pillar and tonsil (Figure 19.18). The uvula istypically deviated to the opposite side. Unilateralbulging of the posterior pharyngeal wall may beseen with a retropharyngeal abscess. Bulging ofthe lateral wall seenwith a parapharyngeal abscess. Palpation Palpation of swelling seen on the soft palate or pharyngeal walls is not recommended due to thepotential for disrupting an abscess.

It may be usefulif infectious mononucleosus (atypical lymphocy-tosis), serious bacterial infection, leukemia or animmunocompromised state are concerns. Blood cultures Blood cultures should be obtained in patients with deep space infections (except most cases of periton-sillitis), immunocompromised states, sepsis andepiglottitis (once the patient's airway is secure). Rapid diagnostic tests for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus Rapid antigen tests (RATs) and throat cultures aid in the diagnosis of GABHS pharyngitis. Thetonsils and posterior pharyngeal wall should beswabbed vigorously to obtain an accurate speci-men for both RATs and throat cultures. RATs aregenerally considered to have good positive pre-dictive values, but insufficient sensitivities torule out GABHS infection (most being 79-95% sensitive). Specificities range from 31% to 100%,with most being 90-98% specific dependingupon which commercial test is used. Results forRATs usually return in 10-30 minutes. Both RATsand cultures identify the Group A antigen, notactive infection. Since 15-20% of the populationare chronic carriers of GABHS, treating all posi-tive RATs or cultures with antibiotics inevitablyresults in overtreatment. Throat cultures All negative RATs should be confirmed with culture; otherwise, a significant number of casesof GABHS pharyngitis missed. Culturefor GABHS is 90-95% and 94-100%specific. About one-third of patients with infec-tious mononucleosus and diptheria have positiveGABHS cultures, which may lead to misdiag-noses. The true gold standard for determiningGABHS infection is with acute and convalescentantistreptolysin-O (ASO) titers. However ASOtiters are not practical in an outpatient settingand are rarely done. Table 19.11 lists situations in which obtaining throat cultures are indicated.Heterophil antibody test (monospot test) The monospot test, used to detect EBV infectious mononucleosus, may not be positive until 1-2weeks of illness. The test's sensitivity declines asthe patient's age decreases, with a 95% sensitivityin adults but only a 30% sensitivity in those lessthan 20 months of age. This test is almost alwaysnegative in persons of Japanese ancestry forunknown reasons. False positives may occur withsome systemic illnesses, such as leukemia. Electrocardiogram An electrocardiogram (ECG) would be useful in the patient with throat discomfort, a negativepharyngeal examination, and a history compat-ible with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Radiologic studies Plain films Asoft tissue lateral view of the neck is useful in may be normal despite thepresence of these illnesses. Any patient whoappears unstable should not leave the emer-gency department (ED) for radiographs. The \"steeple sign\" (narrowing of the airway) due to glottic and subglottic edema is a reliablefinding of croup, although an X-ray is not com-monly needed. A soft tissue lateral radiograph ofthe neck is abnormal in 90% cases of epiglottitis.Positive findings include an enlarged, misshapenepiglottis (\"thumbprint\" sign) and swelling ofthe retropharyngeal soft tissues (Figure 19.20).Table 19.11 Situations in which throat cultures should be obtained Evidence of epiglottitis, peritonsillitis or retropharyngeal abscess (once airway secured).

Copyright 2002, with permission from Elsevier.Plain films are useful for excluding epiglottitis in cases of bacterial tracheitis and croup. Abnormal retropharyngeal soft tissue swelling may be also seen with retropharyngeal abscess(Figure 19.21). Nonspecific soft tissue swellingmay be seen in a patient with a parapharyngealabscess. Patients with Ludwig's angina may haveswelling of the submandibular soft tissues, airwaynarrowing and gas collections on plain film. Air inthe soft tissues may also be seen on plain film inpatients with laryngeal trauma or burns. If a FB isradiopaque, it may be seen. Ultrasound Ultrasound (US) is useful in the evaluation of deep space infections when the goal is todistinguish between cellulitis and abscess. UShas the advantage over computerized tomog-raphy (CT) in critically ill patients, who shouldnot be transported from the ED. Computerized tomography CT with intravenous (IV) contrast is useful in the evaluation of throat pain with a suspected neckmass or laryngeal trauma. CT may also help dis-tinguish abscess from cellulitis, and assist in sur-gical planning for deep space infections. CT willdemonstrate fractures of the hyoid, cricoid andthyroid cartilages, and dislocation of the cricoary-tenoid joints. The patient's airway must be stable prior to transport to CT. Laryngoscopy Patients with drooling, inability to swallow, FBsensation, dysphonia and/or laryngeal neck painrequire complete visualization of the pharynx if history, physical and diagnostic imaging do notidentify the etiology of the illness. Laryngoscopy is bacter-ial tracheitis, isualization of a swollen epiglottis in epiglottitis. Erythematous, Figure 19.20 Epiglottitis.

Laryngoscopy may show mucosal tears,cartilaginous fractures or dislocations in patientswith trauma. Edema, burned tissue, erythema andulcerations may be seen on laryngoscopy in apatient with a chemical or thermal burn. General treatment principles Most management decisions relevant to the patient with sore throat concern antibiotic use and pallia-tive measures. More serious considerations involveairway management and emergency anesthesiol-ogy or ENT consultation for procedures. Airway management Patients with illnesses associated with upper air-way involvement (e.g., epiglottitis, deep spaceinfections, trauma, burns and FBs) should be han-dled carefully to avoid precipitating sudden com-plete airway obstruction. Allow patients tomaintain the position in which they are mostcomfortable. Pediatric IV lines should not beestablished in the ED unless the child is already inextremis. Never leave these patients alone!Difficult airway equipment should be ready foruse at the bedside. Definitive airway manage-ment is usually best accomplished by an oto-laryngologist and anesthesiologist in the OR withthe neck prepped for a tracheostomy. Volume repletion Patients who are not tolerating sufficient oralhydration should be given IV crystalloid fluids. Pain relief Anesthetic lozenges, throat sprays and salt watergargles may help mild to moderate discomfort.Viscous lidocaine or Xylocaine may be used for acute temporary relief, but should not be usedfrequently or chronically because they may maskan underlying disorder and cause toxicity. Theseagents also decrease the gag reflex and may leadto aspiration. Gargling with benadryl elixir isanother option, although the pain relief is brief.Patients with mild to moderate pain may do wellwith acetaminophen or ibuprofen alone. Elixirs(even in adults) may be better tolerated thantablets. Patients with severe pain may requireoral or IV narcotics. Other palliative measuresinclude air humidification and voice rest. Antibiotics Antibiotics are indicated in patients with sus-pected bacterial infections. Despite patients' mis-conceptions, antibiotics will not help most sorethroats. The disadvantages of overtreating withantibiotics include increased bacterial drug resist-ance, decreased immune response, disruption ofnatural microbial ecology, antibiotic-associatedside effects and patients' expectations for antibi-otics repeated episodes of sore throat.GABHS pharyngitis resolves spontaneously in3-5 days without antibiotics. However, untreatedGABHS infection may result in significant seque-lae, including rheumatic fever, peritonsillitis, andglomerulonephritis. A recent resurgence in inva-sive streptococcal infections (e.g., scarlet fever andstreptococcal toxic shock syndrome) has alsoinfluenced the aggressive treatment of pharyn-gitis. Early antibiotic treatment has been shownto shorten the course and severity of illness anddecrease transmission of GABHS. Controversy exists concerning the selection of patients with pharyngitis for laboratory testingand antibiotic treatment. One popular strategy isbased on the adult scoring system for GABHS.The presence of two or more risk factors (Table19.12) indicates a 56% probability of disease;thus, empiric oral antibiotic therapy is indicated. The general consensus is that patients with a his- tory of rheumatic fever or a family member witha history of rheumatic fever (or documentedGABHS infection), evidence of scarlet feverand/or partially treated pharyngitis should alsobe empirically treated with antibiotics. Manyexperts recommend empiric treatment for GABHSpharyngitis in the midst of a GABHS, rheumaticThroat pain Table 19.12 Adult scoring system for GABHS Risk factors Pharyngeal exudates Tender anterior cervical adenopathy Fever /H1102238/H11034C Absence of coryza Dalton HP , Brody CE, Link K.

Some believe that those who will be unavailable for follow-up (transient and noncompliant patients)should be empirically treated for GABHS pharyn-gitis, since cultures take 24-48 hours to return. Patients with less than two risk factors shouldundergo RAT and throat culture if RAT negative,and only be treated if either result is positive.Despite the fact that many providers empiricallyprescribe antibiotics for the above -mentioned sit- uations, the American Academy of Pediatrics(AAP), the American Heart Association (AHA)and the Infectious Disease Society of America(IDSA) all recommend doing at least one labora-tory test before the decision to administer antibi-otics is made. The best strategy for an individualclinician depends upon the prevalence of strepto-coccal disease in the population, the ease of follow-up, and the availability and accuracy of the specificRAT used. Antibiotic therapy for GABHS pharyngitis should be initiated within 9 days of symptom onsetto prevent acute rheumatic fever. The treatment ofchoice for GABHS infection remains penicillin. Aone-time dose of parenteral benzathine penicillinshould be given to patients who cannot tolerate peros (PO) or in whom poor compliance is suspected. Erythromycin is the main alternative to peni- cillin, although several alternative regimens exist.Antibiotic treatment is also indicated for lingualtonsillitis, gonococcal and chlamydial pharyngi-tis, diphtheria angina, epiglottitis oralfluconazole or itraconazole. of herpes pharyngitis should be treatedwith acyclovir or famcyclovir. Steroids Steroids may be useful with severe bilateral ton-sillar swelling in infectious mononucleosis andsome cases of lingual tonsillitis. Research hasdemonstrated that steroids slightly reduce timeto resolution of pain in severe cases of pharyn-gitis, although this is not common practice. Steroiduse for epiglottitis, Ludwig's angina and causticingestion is controversial. A single dose of steroidsis useful in the treatment of croup. Racemic epinephrine Racemic epinephrine is useful in in moderate and severe croup. It hasreportedly been for epiglottitis and lingual tonsillitis. Evidence-based studies are neededprior to recommending it for use in these circum-stances. Needle aspiration and incision and drainage Until recently, incision and drainage or immediate tonsillectomy was the recommended treatmentfor peritonsillitis caused by an abscess. Currently,needle aspiration is recommended by either atrained physician or otolaryngologist. It has beenshown to be equally effective, safer and lesspainful compared to incision and drainage. Thetechnique has been well described. Patients withsevere trismus or those who cannot cooperate(young children) are best served by having thisprocedure or a tonsillectomy done in the OR by anotolaryngologist. Surgical drainage for Ludwig'sangina is reserved for patients with crepitance andabscess, and may be done to eradicate dentalinfections as well. Most cases of retropharyngealabscess require surgical drainage. Special patients Elderly The incidence of infectious pharyngitis declineswith age. Persistent sore throat without obviousphysical findings in an elderly patient shouldprompt a search for neoplasm, particularly ifthere is a history of tobacco use. Pediatric Children with GABHS pharyngitis should receiveantibiotics for 24 hours prior to returning to school.Gonococcal pharyngitis may be seen in sexuallyabused children and sexually active adolescents. Immune compromised Any immunocompromised patient with pharyn-gitis who is going to be discharged needs to befollowed closely as an outpatient. Asplenic patients are at risk for developing streptococcalsepsis and should be admitted. Leukopenic patients should only be discharged if they havean adequate granulocyte count. Candidal infec-tion is the most common of pharyngitis inpatients with acquired immuno deficiency syn- drome (AIDS). A patient with a candidal infectionwithout an obvious underlying risk factor shouldPrimary Complaints 285Throat painbe evaluated for potential neoplasm or an immunocompromised state. Infectious mononucleosus Patients should be informed that infectiousmononucleosus may persist for weeks to months.Steroids may help reduce severe tonsillar edema. Any patient with infectious mononucleosus andabdominal pain should undergo immediate USor CT to detect splenic rupture, which typicallyoccurs after 4-6 weeks of illness. If given amoxi-cillin or ampicillin, 90% of patients with EBVinfection will develop a diffuse macular rash,often mistaken for an allergic reaction. All patientswith infectious mononucleosus should be seenby their primary care physician within 1 week oftheir diagnosis for follow-up. Post-tonsillectomy About 10% of patients will present with bleeding5-10 days after tonsillectomy. The majority ofthese patients are in the pediatric age group andhave minor bleeding from the tonsillar veins thatcan be controlled with direct pressure. About 1%of patients presenting with post-tonsillectomybleeding (usually males in the age 15-24-year agegroup) have major bleeding which requires emer-gent airway control and massive transfusion. ENTshould be consulted emergently in these patients. Disposition Emergent ear, nose and throat consultation and admission The following are admission criteria for patients with throat pain: 1.Evidence of or at risk for airway compromise (includes all suspected cases of epiglottitis,retropharyngeal abscess, Ludwig's angina and 4.Patients whose pain is intolerable despitemaximal oral analgesia. 5.Controversy still exists concerning whetherthe patient with a peritonsillar abscessshould be treated in the ED and dischargedor hospitalized. This depends not only uponthe appearance of the patient but thepreference of the ENT consultant. 6.Evidence of disseminated spread of infection. 7.Evidence of deep neck space infection,including necrotizing fasciitis.* 8.Evidence significant immunocompromised patients).* 9.Post-tonsillectomy patients with anybleeding other than the most minor.* Any patient with a chronic sore throat or evi- dence of carcinoma of the oropharynx should be referred to ENT to be seen within 5-7 days forfurther work-up of a potential neoplasm. Observation/serial evaluation Patients with peritonsillitis may benefit fromobservation over a several hour period, duringwhich time they receive IV hydration, antibioticsand a PO challenge. All of these patients musthave close follow-up within 24 hours with anotolaryngologist to check for abscess formation. Discharge Most patients with sore throat can be safely dis-charged. If an antibiotic treatment is plannedpending culture results, it is important to estab-lish a detailed plan for follow-up. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Recognize the signs of impending completeairway obstruction: sniffing position,apprehension, tachypnea, drooling, voicealteration and stridor. Patients with these signsshould be allowed to assume the position inwhich they are most comfortable. ENT and anesthesia should be consultedemergently and the OR prepared for patientswho appear to have impending or actualairway obstruction. Always be prepared for complete airwayobstruction and other catastrophiccomplications (sepsis, carotid arteryhemorrhage) in any patient with a deepspace infection or epiglottitis. Despite epiglottitis becoming relativelyuncommon in the pediatric population, it isoften overlooked, resulting in fatalconsequences. Consider this diagnosis inthose with rapid onset of sore throat, throatpain out of proportion to examination,respiratory symptoms accompanying the *These patients are usually admitted to the ICU or go directly to the OR.286 Primary Complaints Throat painsore throat or the sensation of a \"lump\" in the throat. Do not fail to recognize an abscess orimpending abscess in the potential spaces ofthe head and neck. Plain radiographs of the neck may be usefulfor detecting retropharyngeal abscess andepiglottitis. Advanced imaging in a stablepatient with a secure airway is useful forfurther diagnosis, distinguishing abscessfrom cellulitis, and surgical planning. Antibiotics should be tailored to the specificdisease process suspected. Understand thecommon rationale and criteria for testing andempiric antibiotic prescribing for pharyngitis. Needle aspiration of a suspected peritonsillarabscess should only be attempted by trainedphysicians because of potential significantcomplications (puncture of major vessels ofthe neck). A patient with a chronic sore throat (especially one who has an alcohol or tobaccohistory) needs prompt referral to ENT forwork-up of a potential cancer. References 1.Bradley CP .

According to the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention, there were nearly 15 million visitsto the ED in the year 2000 for injuries involvingthe extremity. The most common sites of injurywere the wrist and hand, followed by the ankleand shoulder. It is important to perform a thoroughbut efficient history and physical examination inorder to accurately diagnose and provide initialtreatment for these injuries. When improperlytreated, extremity injuries may lead to long-termpain and disability for the patient. Anatomic essentials Each extremity can be viewed as a group of indi-vidual bones held together by a musculo-ligamentous apparatus. Careful attention must bepaid to the vascular and nerve supply to eachextremity; injury to these structures may be over-looked when fractures are present. Each extremityisencased in soft tissue that is often subdivided into fascial compartments. The clinician should20 Extremity trauma Dan Garza, MDand Gregory W.

Each extremity is divided into compartments by longitudinal fascia. Best seen on cross section,these compartments are named according to theiranatomic position. For example, the compart ments of the leg and the structures they contain areshown in Table 20.4 and Figure 20.9. History How did the injury occur? The nature, magnitude, and direction of forces applied to the extremity help determine the likelyresulting injury. Crush injury may predispose to compartment syndrome or rhabdomyolysis. Ashearing force onto gravel or dirt raises suspicionfor foreign bodies that must be removed to avoidthe risk of wound infection or osteomyelitis. Fallsfrom a height, significant collisions, or loading ofa patient's entire weight on a single joint increasesthe likelihood of fracture. Trauma that involvesforce imparted across the transverse axis of a boneraises the possibility of a transverse fracture,whereas a force along the long axis will morelikely lead to compression or impaction fractures.Table 20.5 summarizes classic injuries resulting from common mechanisms. When did the injury occur? Depending on the nature of the injury, the time elapsed since its onset may be important. As theamount of time between injury and wound carefor a laceration or open fracture increases, therisk of infection also increases. Depending onlocation, lacerations may need to undergo delayed closure if /H110226-12 hours have passed. In the case of vascular injury, blood flow must be returnedwithin 6 hours for a meaningful chance of limbsalvage.Nerve Sensory Motor Axillary Lateral aspect of Shoulder (C5,6) deltoid abduction Median Lateral palmar aspect Abduction of (C6-8) of hand (including thumb lateral palmar half of ring finger) Radial Lateral dorsum of Thumb/wrist (C6-8) hand extension Ulnar Medial (C8,T1) of hand (including abduction medial palmar half of ring finger) Femoral Anterior aspect Knee extension (L2-4) of thigh Saphenous Medial aspect of leg (L2-4) and Sciatic Posterior aspect of Knee Common Posterior aspect of leg(L4-S2) Superficial Lateral aspect of Foot eversion peroneal lower leg (lateral (L4-S2) Dorsum of foot compartment) Deep First toe web space Dorsiflexion peroneal (anterior(L4-S2) compartment) Table 20.3 Peripheral nerves: sensory and motor function Table 20.4 Compartments of the leg Compartment Contents Anterior Muscles Tibialis anterior 295Extremity trauma right- or left-handed? What is the patient's occupation? It is appropriate to assess the relative importance of an affected upper extremity to a patient's quality of life. Although all patients shouldreceive optimal care, an injury to the dominant hand of a professional illustrator may be treatedmore aggressively by a consultant. What is the patient's tetanus status? Although rare, the potentially fatal consequences of tetanus can be easily avoided with appropriateprophylaxis (Table C.4, Appendix C). This may beoverlooked in complicated fractures or lacerationsrequiring time-consuming repair. The most likely individuals to have inadequate prior immuniza-tion are those older than 60 and immigrants. If apatient's tetanus status is unknown or uncertain,he or she should receive the complete series. When was the patient's last meal? The patient's injury may require reduction under conscious sedation or general anesthesia; assessingthe risk of aspiration requires knowledge of thetime since the patient's last meal. Acceptable limitsmay vary according to institution and injury. Associated symptoms Is the extremity weak, cold, or numb? These symptoms might indicate a nerve or vessel injury in the affected extremity. The clinician must Anterior Deep posteriorLateral n.

An obvious bony deformity orjoint dislocation should be reduced promptly inan attempt to restore any neurovascular deficit. Past medical Of particular concern is the patient with a coagu-lopathy, in whom hemodynamic status and serialhematocrits may need to be followed closely.Those taking warfarin require coagulation studies. Hemophiliacs should have the appr opriate factor replacement transfused. Other considerations include allergies to analgesics or anesthetics anda history of prior surgeries or surgical hardwarein the affected extremity. Physical examination The physical examination should begin withadequate exposure. Patients will often presentwith various bandages or splints applied, whichmust be carefully removed. While the tendencyto \"just order an X-ray\" may seem efficient, thefew minutes required to carefully examine theinjury may save unnecessary radiographs orreveal unexpected findings that demand imme- diate attention. In addition, jewelry and clothingthat may form a tourniquet due to swellingshould be removed immediately. Analgesiashould not be withheld pending a definitivediagnosis. In fact, the use of parenteral, regional,or local anesthesia may assist the examiner bymaking it easier for the patient to comply withthe physical examination. It is recommended toperform a sensory examination before blockingany sensory input with a local or regional nerveblock. Vital sign abnormalities (tachycardia, hyper- tension) tend to be a response to pain. The failureof tachycardia to resolve with adequate analgesiashould raise suspicion for blood loss. The general approach to the assessment of extremity injuries includes evaluation of the following: Bones and ligaments Bony deformities are often obvious, but moresubtle clues to fractures include crepitus, markedswelling, point tenderness, and ecchymosis. Knowledge of local anatomy should allow the examiner to palpate any structures of concern.Sprains or ligamentous injuries may be characterized as first-, second-, or third-degree.First-degree sprains are tears of only a few fibersand result in minimal swelling, point tenderness,and normal joint motion and stability. Second-degree sprains are more significant tears of theligament, alth ough not complete disruptions. Signs include more significant swelling, tender- ness, and functional loss, although joint motionand stability r emain normal. Third-degree sprains are complete disr uptions of the ligament with marked swelling, tenderness, functional loss, andabnormal motion and laxity at the joint. Muscles and tendons Rupture of tendons may result from repetitivestress or excessive loading, or from deep lacer-ations that directly disrupt the tendon. Regardlessof cause, functional compr omise should be evi- dent on physical examination. In the case of lacer-ations, the tendon should be directly visualizedthrough its full range of motion. Strains (injuriesto muscle fibers) have a similar classification tosprains. First-degree strains are disruptions of afew fibers and are characterized by mild local-ized pain exacerbated by stretch. Second-degreestrains are more significant, although not com-plete disruptions, with more marked tendernessand ecchymosis. Third-degree strains are com-plete disruptions with significant tenderness,ecchymosis, and loss of function. Larger muscles,such as the biceps, may display obvious deform-ities when ruptured. Nerves and vessels Care must be taken to assess the neurovascularstatus distal to an injured extremity. Neurovascu-lar damage may result from direct trauma, dis-ruption due to a severely displaced fracture or dislocation, or from fracture fragments. Injuriesto nerves are more common than vascular injury,and range in severity from neuropraxia (secondaryto contusion), which results in eventual recovery,to complete disruption or destruction. Completeassessment should include sensory, motor and deep tendon reflex (DTR) examinations. Table 20.6lists common injuries associated with possiblenerve deficits. Although not as common, vascular injuries are potentially devastating. Complete assessmentinvolves capillary refill time, palpating pulses, andnoting color not palpable, a Doppler stethoscope should bePrimary Complaints 297Extremity trauma used to confirm flow. Table 20.7 lists common injuries associated with possible vascular deficits. Soft tissue (compartments) Bound by stiff fascial walls, limb compartmentsare susceptible to dangerously high pressureswhen there is an increase in volume. When traumaresults in muscle swelling or extravasation of blood, there is little room within the compartmentto expand. As intra-compartmental pressures rise,blood flow to the nerves and muscles decreasesand, if unrelieved, muscle necrosis occurs. Thisprocess represents compartment syndrome and is classically characterized by the five \" Ps:\" Pain Pallor Paralysis Pulselessness Paresthesias Unfortunately, by the time all of these signs andsymptoms are present, permanent damage hasusually occurred. The key is to maintain a highindex of clinical suspicion. Certain fractures aremore commonly associated with compartmentsyndromes; tibial fracture with anterior tibialartery or supracondylar fracture ofthe humerus with brachial artery involvementare two examples. The earliest manifestation ispain in the affected extremity followed by pares-thesias. Pain can often be exacerbated by passiveextension of the fingers or passive flexion of the toes. Regional Shoulder Examination of the shoulder begins with inspec- tion and palpation of the clavicle and acromio-clavicular joint. Deformity, swelling, or tendernessof the clavicle may represent a fracture. Superiordisplacement or prominence of the lateral clavicleis seen with complete (Grade 3) acromioclavicularseparations (Figure 20.10), whereas incomplete separations (Grades 1 and 2) often present only with point tenderness at the joint. Tenderness,swelling, or bruising over the proximal humerusmay represent a fracture. Anterior shoulder dislocations (Figure 20.11), which are far more common than posterior dislocations, present with the patient holding the arm fully adducted .There is a loss of the nor- mal rounded contour of the lateral aspect of theshoulder. A simple method to rule out a shoulderdislocation requires the examiner to gently intern-ally and externally rotate the shoulder, followedby asking the patient to place the hand of theinjured extremity across his chest and on theopposite shoulder. Free rotation of the humeralhead is painful and difficult in the presence of ashoulder dislocation, and the ability to performthese maneuvers virtually rules out a dislocation.The musculocutaneous branch of the axillarynerve may be injured in anterior dislocations,resulting in weakness in shoulder abduction and Injury Possible vascular deficit Anterior shoulder Axillary artery dislocation/fracture Supracondylar nerve dislocation/fracture Musculocutaneous nerve Humeral shaft fracture Radial nerve Fracture of distal third of Radial nerve radius Supracondylar fracture Median nerve of humerus Radial nerve Ulnar nerve Posterior elbow dislocation Median nerve Ulnar nerve Wrist fracture/dislocations Median nerve Posterior hip dislocation Sciatic Anterior Extremity injuries and associated nerve deficits Table 20.7 Extremity injuries and associated vascular deficitsExtremity trauma 298 Primary Complaintsdiminished sensation over the lateral aspect of the shoulder. Rotator cuff tears are disruptions of the mus- cles that permit shoulder abduction and rotation:subscapularis, infraspinatus, supraspinatus, andteres minor. Consequently, patients present withweak and painful active abduction and externalrotation, as well as tenderness over the greater tuberosity (the insertion site of supraspinatus).Passive range of motion may be pain-free. In thedrop arm test , the patient abducts the shoulder to 90\u00b0 and then is asked to slowly lower the arm. Inthe presence of a rotator cuff tear, the patient isunable to lower the arm slowly and smoothly. Examination of the scapula requires palpation along its entire surface. As significant force isrequired to fracture the scapula, the mechanism is usually a direct blow or fall from height.Fractures of the scapula may be associated withpneu mothorax, rib fractures, and vertebral com- pression fractures. As abduction beyond 90\u00b0 involves scapular rotation, this motion shouldproduce pain in a scapular fracture. Elbow Deformity at the elbow may represent a fracture or dislocation, and radiographs are needed to dif-ferentiate the two. Important clues include tentingof the posterior aspect of the elbow by the olecra-non in a posterior dislocation, isolated tendernessof the proximal radius in a radial head fracture, orpoint tenderness and swelling of the olecranon inolecranon fractures. Any effusion identified eitherclinically or radiographically in the setting oftrauma is concerning for fracture (Figure 20.12). Supracondylar fractures (Figure 20.13) occur most commonly in children who have fallen on anoutstretched hand. Displacement of the distalhumeral fracture fragment posteriorly may causeinjury to the brachial artery or median, radial, andulnar nerves. It is therefore important to documentdistal neurovascular findings in patients with a supracondylar fracture. Patients with supra-condylar fractures are at risk of compartmentsyndrome of the forearm, leading to musclenecrosis and contractures of muscles(Volkmann's ischemic contractures). Orthopedicconsultation disposition is manda-tory, with hospitalization, reduction, and surgeryif the fracture is significantly displaced. Nursemaid's elbow is a subluxation of the radial head that results from longitudinal tractionapplied along the radius. This usually occurswhen a child's arm is pulled to prevent him from Figure 20.10 Complete (Grade 3) acromioclavicular separation.

The child is usu- ally /H110215 years old and presents with the arm held in passive pronation and dangling to the side.Patients typically refuse to use the affected limb(i.e., refusal to reach for any offered objects, suchas keys). Nursemaid's elbow is a clinical diagno-sis; routine radiographs are not indicated unlessa fracture is suspected. Wrist Examination of the distal radius and ulna may reveal characteristic deformities on inspection. Dorsal angulation of the radius after a fall on an outstretched hand is the typical presentationof a Colle's fracture (Figure 20.14), whereas volarangulation represents a Smith's fracture.Minimally displaced fractures of either the radiusor ulna may present with minimal swelling andpoint tenderness. A thorough examination of allbony landmarks is essential. Vascular integrity of the radial and ulnar arter- ies can be assessed by the Allen test . The examiner applies pressure to both arteries and asks thepatient to lift his hand in the air and repeatedlypump his fist. The examiner then releases theradial artery and determines the time required forthe blanched hand to return to its normal color.The process is repeated for the ulnar artery.Significant differences in refill time between the two arteries or between the affected andunaffected hand suggest vascular injury, andrequires consultation. Examination of the carpal bones requires care- ful palpation of each bone, as fractures may notbe immediately apparent on radiographs. This istypical of scaphoid fractures (Figure 20.15), themost common carpal fracture. As missed scaphoidfractures significantly increase the likelihood ofavascular necrosis, the physical examination ismore important than radiographs. Two sensitivesigns for a scaphoid fracture include tendernessin the anatomic snuffbox and pain with axialloading of the thumb. Clinical suspicion based oneither of these findings and a history of falling onan outstretched hand (FOOSH) mandates appro-priate splinting and follow-up in 10-14 days forrepeat films. Triquetral fractures are the second most com- mon carpal fracture, often as a result of a FOOSHmechanism. These may often only be visualizedon a lateral radiograph (Figure 20.16). Patients Figure 20.14 Colles fracture. Lateral radiograph showing a fracture of the distal radius, with dorsaldisplacement of the distal fragment. Courtesy :S.V. Mahadevan, MD.

Courtesy : S.V.Mahadevan, MD.Primary Complaints 301Extremity trauma present with tenderness just distal to the ulnar styloid. Lunate fractures, although less common,are potentially devastating because, like thescaphoid, they carry a significant risk of avascu-lar necrosis (Kienbock's disease). Patients gener-ally complain of centrally located wrist pain aftera fall. On examination, tenderness is just distal to Lister's tubercle. As follow-up. Ligamentous disruption can also occur between carpal the most common of whichcauses scapholunate dissociation. Particular atten-tion should be paid for tenderness at the joint,which is immediately ulnar to the anatomicsnuffbox. Watson's test for scapholunate instabil- ity is considered positive if pain or subluxation iselicited when the patient moves the wrist fromulnar to radial deviation while the examinerapplies pressure at the scaphoid tubercle. Hand Bony deformities are often obvious in fractures and dislocations of the hand. It is important thatnot only angulation and displacement be noted,but also rotational deformities. All three factorsmust be addressed in an adequate reduction.Palpation of each metacarpal and phalanx mayreveal point tenderness suspicious for a fracture (Figure 20.17). Any injury to the hand should prompt an examination of the sensorimotor function of themedian, radial, and ulnar nerves (Table 20.3). Thesensory examination of the hand is best assessedby two-point discrimination. The patient shouldbe able to distinguish between two discrete bluntpoints at a minimum distance of 5 mm at the fin-gertips and 10 mm at the base of the palm. Thisexamination can be performed with a paper clipwhose ends have been separated to 5 mm. Tendon injuries may be apparent upon initial inspection. Flexor tendon injuries may result inthe finger held in relative extension compared toother digits, whereas extensor tendon injuriesresult in relative flexion (Figure 20.18). Deficits or pain on active range of motion indicate injury tothe tendon being assessed. Care must be taken toassess thepatient flex the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. When assessing the FDS, the examiner must Figure 20.16 Triquetral fracture. Lateral X-ray of the wrist revealing avulsion fracture of the triquetral carpal bone. Courtesy : S.V.Mahadevan, MD.

Mahadevan, MD.Extremity trauma 302 Primary Complaintsisolate the digit by holding all other fingers in extension. Otherwise, adjacent FDS tendons may assist in flexion of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint and mimic normal function.Hip The position in which the affected leg is held upon presentation can be a significant clue to the under-lying pathology. Anterior dislocations andfemoral neck fractures (Figure 20.19) present withthe leg abducted, externally rotated, and, in frac-tures, shortened. Posterior dislocations presentwith the leg shortened, adducted, and internallyrotated. Palpation may reveal tenderness at the site of fracture or may reveal a dislocated femoralhead. It is important to assess range of motion andstability with respect to flexion/extension, abduc-tion/adduction, and internal/external rotation. Knee Asymmetry of the knees, particularly loss of the peripatellar groove, can indicate a joint effusionresulting from includes: 1.Testing for a fluid wave by tapping the lateral aspect of the knee while simultaneously compressing the medial and superior aspects. Figure 20.18 Mallet finger. Lateral radiograph of the right Left femoral AP X-ray of the pelvis demonstrating a trans-cervical fractureof the effusion by pressing against the femoralcondyle and eliciting a tapping sensation. Additional landmarks important for palpation are the patella and fibular head (tenderness indi-cates suspicion for fracture), and the joint line(tenderness is suspicious for meniscal/collateralligament injury). While an effusion may distortthe anatomy of the affected knee, the position ofthe patella should be compared with that of theunaffected knee to r ule out patellar dislocation, which almost always occurs laterally, or patellar fracture (Figure 20.20). The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is com- monly injured when the foot is planted and a lat-eral force or torsion is applied to the knee. It can bereadily assessed by two maneuvers. The Lachman test(Figure 20.21) is performed with the patient supine knee flexed 20-30\u00b0. The examinergrasps the distal fibula with one hand and theproximal tibia with the other hand. The lower legis given a brisk forward tug in an attempt to iden-tify a discrete endpoint. A positive test (indicativeof injury) occurs when no endpoint is appreci-ated or there is increased anterior translation ofthe tibia relative to the unaffected side. The ante- rior drawer test (Figure 20.22) is performed with the patient supine and the knee flexed to 90\u00b0.Both hands are placed around the proximal tibia with the thumbs approximated at the anterior tib-ial plateaus. The examiner quickly pulls anteri-orly, without rotation, and feels for a discreteendpoint. The test is positive if no discrete end-point is reached, esp ecially compared to the unaffected side. Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) stability is commonly assessed by the posterior drawer test . This test is performed with the patient supineand the knee flexed to 90\u00b0. There are two differentways it may be performed. The first is the oppos-ite of the anterior drawer test. Absence of a dis-crete endpoint with posterior force applied to thetibia is considered positive. The second approachis positive if anterior force applied to the tibia Figure 20.20 Patella fracture.

If pain is increased, the test is positive. Injuries to the collateral ligaments are assessed by stress tests. The valgus stress test is performed with the patient supine and the knee in 20\u00b0 of flex-ion. With one hand on the lateral aspect of theknee and the other on the foot, the examiner gen-tly abducts and externally rotates the lower leg.Increased laxity compared to the unaffected sideis considered a positive test for medial collateralligament (MCL) injury. In the varus stress test , the examiner adducts and internally rotates the lowerleg to assess the stability of the lateral collateralligament (LCL). Regardless of the maneuver attempted to diag- nose ligamentous injury, pain and effusion maymake adequate examination of the knee impos-sible. Analgesia prior to examination is important.If an adequate examination cannot be performed,the patient should be treated conserv atively with a knee immobilizer and/or crutches. Expeditious follow-up for re-examination (once the swellinghas decreased) should be arranged. Ankle Both ankle sprains and fractures may present with marked swelling and point tenderness. Themajor ligaments of the ankle are assessed by pla-cing stress on them in an attempt to elicit insta-bility. These maneuvers are frequently limited bysoft tissue swelling and pain. Therefore, adequateanalgesia and immediate application of rest, ice,compression, and elevation (RICE) assists in the ankle examination. If the examination isquestionable or inadequate, and orthopedic con-sultation is not indicated, then conservativetreatment and follow-up for repeat assessment(once swelling and pain has subsided) is appro-priate. The anterior drawer test (Figure 20.24) assesses the stability of the anterior talofibular ligament.The examiner exerts a downward force on the tibiawhile simultaneously attempting to \"lift up\" thefoot while grasping behind the heel. A significantdifference from the unaffected side ( /H110222mm) or dimpling of the anterior skin (suction sign) isconsidered positive. Figure 20.23 Apley compression test. Figure 20.24Positive anterior test.Primary Complaints 305Extremity traumaThe talar tilt test (Figure 20.25) may also be used to assess the integrity of the anterior talofibular ligament. The examiner plantar flexes and invertsthe patient's ankle; an increase in laxity com-pared with the unaffected side is considered apositive test. Any tenderness over the medial aspect of the ankle warrants an examination of the proximalfibular head to assess for a possible Maisonneuvefracture. A result of external rotation of the ankle,the Maisonneuve fracture is a spiral fracture of thefibular head found in association with fracturesof the medial malleolus or deltoid ligamentinjury (Figure 20.26). Integrity of the Achilles tendon is assessed by the Thompson test . The examiner squeezes the calf with the patient prone. If the foot does not plan-tar flex, the test is positive for Achilles tendon disruption. (b) (a)Figure 20.25 Positive talar tilt test. Figure 20.26Maissoneuve fracture.

Courtesy :Kathryn Stevens, MD.Extremity trauma 306 Primary ComplaintsFoot Care must be taken to assess the foot separately from the ankle. While the deformity of dislocatedmetatarsophalangeal or interphalangeal jointsmay be obvious, fractures may present with onlyminimal swelling and point tenderness. Stressfractures occur most commonly in the secondand third metatarsals and often cannot be seenon initial radiographs. Injury to the base of thefifth metatarsal may be seen with inversioninjuries of the ankle (Figure 20.27). Injuries to thecalcaneus are associated with a fall onto the feetor with a severe twisting mechanism, and resultin heel pain and soft tissue swelling. In fallswhich produce axial loading, a careful search for coincident lower extremity injuries and com-pression fractures of the thoracolumbar spineshould occur. The Lisfranc injury (Figure 20.28) isa tarsometatarsal dislocation that occurs whenthere is a direct axial load on a foot that is plantarflexed. Radiographs are often negative, althougha fracture of the base of the second metatarsal is pathognomonic. Any examination revealingtenderness at the tarsometatarsal joint or base ofthe second metatarsal should prompt the clini-cian to consider a Lisfranc injury. Diagnostic testing Radiographs Radiographs are important in evaluating extrem-ity trauma. By revealing the nature of a fractureor dislocation, they assist in decisions regardingthe need for reduction or operative repair, thelength of time required for immobilization, orpotential complications during rehabilitation.However, indiscriminate use of radiographs forextremity pain leads to higher health care costs,unnecessary radiation exposure, and increasedlength of stay in the ED. Therefore, the challengeto the emergency physician is to order radi-ographs when appropriate . Research on judicious film utilization in patients with extremity injuriescontinues to evolve. The Ottawa ankle, foot, andknee rules (Table 20.8) represent guidelines Figure 20.27 5th metatarsal fracture. AP views of the left ankle showing a fracture of the base of thefifth metatarsal. Courtesy :S.V. Mahadevan, MD.Primary Complaints 307Extremity traumaderived from high-quality evidence in large studies. Once the decision is made to order radio- graphs, the clinician should follow several impor-tant principles. First, it is important to formulate a presumptive diagnosis based on history andexamination. Some injuries, such as a scaphoidfracture or posterior shoulder dislocation, mayrequire special visualization techniques not included in a normal series. Also, injuries such asa scaphoid fracture, non-displaced radial headfracture, and metatarsal stress fracture may not be apparent on initial films. If these injuries aresuspected, patients should be treated as thoughthey have such an injury despite negative radi-ographs, and appropriate follow-up for repeatimaging should be arranged. The use of weight-bearing films to diagnose a Lisfranc injury oracromioclavicular (AC) separation is often notfeasible in a busy ED; conservative treatment andfollow-up radiographs are appropriate for thesepatients. The clinician should also ensure that the radio- graphs taken are adequate to visualize structures of concern. At least two views, taken perpendicu-larto one another, are necessary for most bones and joints. Sometimes a third (oblique) view maybe necessary. A fracture of a long bone is oftenassociated with a nearby dislocation or additionalfracture along the shaft; therefore, films shouldinclude the joints above and below the injury.Finally, if any reduction has been attempted, Figure 20.28 Lisfranc fracture-dislocation. DP oblique radiograph of the left foot showing fracturesthrough the bases of the second and third metatarsals, and lateral dislocation of themetatarsals. Courtesy :Kathryn Stevens, MD.Extremity trauma 308 Primary Complaintspost-reduction films should be ordered after the extremity is splinted to assess adequacy of reduc-tion and identify small fractures which mighthave been initially obscured. Description of fractures Once a fracture is visualized on the radiograph, itis essential that the emergency physician com-municate to a consultant the location and nature of the injury. An accurate verbal description will enable the consultant to make an informed deci-sion regarding disposition and indications foroperative repair. The terms below are commonlyused by orthopedists in fracture description andtherefore facilitate communication. Exposure Perhaps the most important description, and therefore the first that should be mentioned, iswhether the fracture is open or closed. An open fracture is exposed to the environment and often requires parenteral antibiotics as well as opera- tive repair. The bone may be obviously protrud-ing through the skin or there may be only a smalllaceration overlying the fracture. It is thereforeimportant to clean and thoroughly examine theextremity for skin integrity. A closed fracture is pres- ent when the skin overlying a fracture is intact.Location Description of fracture location can involve both general anatomic terms and landmarks specificto a particular bone. Fractures of long bones canbe described as being either midshaft or in the proximal or distal thirds . Describing the length of the fracture from either the proximal or distalend provides additional information. Specific anatomic descriptions exist for a var- iety of fractures; often this nomenclature is usedbecause these fractures may require operativerepair or because of specific associated complica- tions. Examples include intertrochanteric and femoral neck fractures of the femur, and supracondy- larfractures of the humerus. Orientation Figure 20.29 illustrates nomenclature based on the direction of the fracture line. A transverse frac- ture runs perpendicular to the long axis of thebone. Oblique fractures run at an angle to the long axis of the bone, usually between 45 and 60\u00b0. Aspiral fracture results from torsion on the bone. Acomminuted fracture consists of more than two fracture fragments, often in a \"shattered\" pattern.Asegmental fracture consists of a single free-floating fracture fragment between two fracture lines.Table 20.8 Ottawa rules for extremity radiographs Ottawa ankle rules Order ankle radiographs only if the patient has anklepain and either of the following:1.Inability to bear weight for four steps, bothimmediately and in the ED 2.Bone tenderness at the posterior edge or distal6cm of either medial or lateral malleolus Ottawa foot rulesOrder foot radiographs only if the patient has foot painand either of the following:1.Inability to bear weight for four steps, bothimmediately and in the ED 2.Bone tenderness at the navicular or base of thefifth metatarsal Ottawa knee rulesOrder knee radiographs only if the patient has kneepain and any of the following:1.Age 55 years or older 2.Isolated tenderness of the patella 3.Tenderness over the head of the fibula 4.Inability to flex to 90\u00b0 5.Inability to bear weight for four steps, bothimmediately and in the ED (a) Transverse (b) Oblique (c) Spiral (d) Comminuted (e) Segmental (f) (g) Greenstick Figure 20.29 Fracture orientation.Primary Complaints 309Extremity traumaTwo fracture patterns found in pediatric populations deserve special mention. A torus frac- ture is demonstrated by \"buckling\" of the bone cortex, whereas a greenstick fracture is an incom- plete fracture with disruption of only one cortical aspect on the radiograph. Displacement Displacement refers to the amount of offset of a fracture fragment as expressed in millimeters orpercent. It is may be modified by the anatomicdirection in which the distal fragment is dis placed. In the Figure 20.30a the tibia fracture is fifty per-cent laterally displaced. Separation/shortening Separation refers to the distance by which two fragments have been pulled apart. Shorteningrefers to the distance by which the bone's length has been reduced. Shortening occurs as a result of impaction of one fragment into another, or as aresult of complete displacement allowing one fragment to \"slide over\" the other. It is measuredin millimeters or centimeters. Angulation Angulation describes the relationship between the long axes of the respective fracture fragments.The direction of angulation is determined by theapex formed by these two axes; Figure 20.30bdemonstrates a fracture with 30 degrees of lateralangulation. Figure 20.30c demonstrates a fracturewith 30 degrees of medial angulation, 100 percentdisplacement, and shortening of an undeterminedlength. Joint involvement The clinician must pay particular attention to frac- tures located near any joint. A fracture that entersthe joint is termed intra-articular and deserves special attention by the consultant. In addition,fractures near a joint may be associated with a dislocation. Such fracture-dislocations oftenrequire operative repair; therefore, joint align- ment should always be assessed prior to commu-nicating with a consultant. General treatment principles As with any patient presenting to the ED, initial assessment of extremity trauma begins with theAirway, Breathing, and Circulation (ABCs). In isolated extremity trauma, circulation deficits, asindicated by diminished or absent pulses, maybe the most worrisome initial finding. If an obvi-ous deformity is present, immediate reductionwith appropriate analgesia should be performedin an attempt to restore circulation. Once a patientcan answer questions reliably and clinical suspi-cion for other injuries \"masked\" by the pain ofthe extremity injury is sufficiently low, treatmentcan be focused on the affected limb. Analgesia should be administered as soon as possible to patients who are hemodynamicallystable. Options include local anesthesia, regionalnerve blocks, and parenteral analgesia. In casesrequiring extremely painful maneuvers such as reduction, conscious sedation should be used. Oral analgesia should never be given until theneed for immediate operative repair or conscioussedation is ruled out. Fractures and dislocations can undergo reduc- tion by the emergency physician, dependingupon individual proficiency. Most emergencyphysicians are comfortable reducing the majorityof dislocations, but any reduction with which theclinician is not familiar or that is unsuccessfulrequires orthopedic consultation. Fractures or dis- locations with signs of neurovascular compromiseshould undergo emergent reduction in the ED , even before radiographs are obtained. The majority of extremity injuries require immobilization, especially following reduction.Appropriate immobilization reduces pain by(a) (c) (b) Figure 20.30 Fracture displacement and angulation.decreasing movement, inflammation, and the chance of bleeding. Casts are rarely applied inthe ED, as patients generally present after anacute injury, and continued swelling confined bya hard cast may lead to compartment syndrome.Therefore, the preferred method of immobilizationin the ED is non-circumferential splinting. Indi-vidual injuries require specific splinting techniques;a summary of common injuries and appropriateimmobilization is listed in Table 20.9. Several general principles apply to patients with extremity trauma. RICE (rest, ice, compres-sion, elevation) remain effective in reducingswelling and discomfort for the patient, andshould be started in the ED. Ice should never beapplied to exposed skin; a towel placed under-neath the ice pack pr events skin damage. The extremity should be elevated (above the level ofthe heart, if possible), and the use of gentle com-pression with an elastic bandage augments venousand lymphatic drainage. Special patients Pediatric Children present with a different set of injuries fol-lowing extremity trauma owing to their develop-ing bones being more pliable. Unique fracturessuch as torus, buckle, and greenstick have alreadybeen discussed. Of particular concern are fracturesinvolving the growth plate, as they may result inlifelong morbidity. Injuries to the growth plate areclassified according to the involvement of metaph-ysis, epiphyseal plate, and epiphysis. The Salter-Harris classification consists of five different types of growth plate fractures based onthe location of the injury (Figure 20.31). In general,the higher the number, the worse the prognosis.Salter Type I fractures are through the epiphyseal plate. Salter Type II fractures are the most common and involve a fracture of the metaphysis withextension through the epiphyseal plate (Figure20.32). Salter Type III extend from epiph- into the epiphyseal plate. Salter Type IV frac- tures involve a fracture through the metaphysis,epiphysis, and epiphyseal plate. Salter Type V frac- tures are crush injuries to the epiphyseal plate andare most common in the knee and ankle. Any tenderness at a joint in pediatric patients should be treated conservatively, as they aremore likely to suffer growth plate fractures thanligament sprains. Even in the setting of negativeradiographs, the clinician should maintain a lowthreshold to treat with immobilization and obtainappropriate orthopedic follow-up fo r a pr esumed Salter-Harris fracture. In fact, given the presenceof multiple ossification centers (six alone in theelbow), the clinician may actually \"over-read\" a Extremity trauma 310 Primary ComplaintsTable 20.9 Extremity injuries and recommended immobilization Injury Immobilization Shoulder dislocation Sling and swatheRotator cuff tear Sling and swatheAcromioclavicular joint Sling sprain Clavicle fracture SlingElbow dislocation Long arm posterior splintSupracondylar fracture Long arm posterior splintRadial head fracture Sugar tong splintOlecranon fracture Long arm posterior splintSubluxation of radial No post-reduction immobilization fracture Long and fracture Long arm posterior splintWrist fracture Long arm posterior or sugar tong splint Navicular fracture Short arm thumb spica splint Thumb arm thumb spica fracture fracture Ulnar or radial Metacarpophalangeal Short arm posterior splint joint dislocation Ulnar arm thumb spica ligament tear splint Phalangeal tuft fracture Aluminum splintProximal phalanx fracture Short arm posterior splint Middle phalanx fracture Aluminum splint or dynamic splinting Interphalangeal joint injury Aluminum splint Adapted from Hamilton GC (ed.).

If the emergency physician is unfamiliar with pediatricradiographs or a radiologist is not available, oneoption may be to obtain plain films of the unaf-fected joint for comparison. Elderly Elderly patients are likely to have osteoporosisand sustain fractures with even minimal trauma.Falls are a source of considerable morbidity. Thethreshold for ordering radiographs should be low.Elderly patients may have substantial difficultieswearing splints and using crutches. Social supportconsiderations and temporary care arrangementsmay become necessary. Beware of occult hip frac-tures in the elderly patient with negative radio-graphs but significant pain on weightbearing. Disposition Although it is impractical to provide an exhaus-tivelist of injuries requiring consultation for pos- sible admission, in general, the following injuries meet such requirements: 1.Open fractures 2.Open joint injuries 3.Vascular injuries 4.Hip fractures and dislocations 5.Compartment syndrome6.Dislocations or displaced fractures that cannot be reduced in the ED. Any injury with which the clinician is not familiaror comfortable mandates at least a phone consult-ation to secure adequate guidance and follow-up. Depending on the nature of the injury, the patientmay require immobilization, non-weightbearingstatus, or weightbearing as tolerated. Follow-upmay be with the primary care physician, ortho-pedic specialist, or hand surgeon. As discussed earlier, RICE is the mainstay of treatment for extremity injuries and should becontinued at home. Although rest is essential,assistive devices such as crutches should be used Primary Complaints 311Extremity trauma Normal Type I Type II Type III Type IV Type V Figure 20.31 Salter-Harris classification.

Pain reduction to a tolerable level, not pain elimination, is a realistic goal while in the ED.Outpatient analgesic/narcotic combinations areoften effective in maintaining adequate anal-gesia. Patients should be instructed to return forsigns of neurovascular compromise, infection,pleuritic chest pain suggesting embolus, severepain not controlled by appropriate analgesia, or asplint that feels too tight. Pitfalls Failure to warn patients that some hairline ornon-displaced fractures may not becomeapparent on radiographs until 7-10 days later. Failure to repeat radiographs when theaffected area is inadequately visualized. Missed open fracture because the extremity isnot inspected or cleaned adequately to revealan overlying laceration. Missed foreign bodies due to inadequateirrigation and exploration. Missed tendon injury due to inadequatevisualization and examination through theentire range of motion. Failure to document a completeneurovascular examination prior toadministering local or regional anesthesia. Missed injuries due to focusing on obvioustrauma without performing a completephysical examination. Failure to update tetanus immunization statusin open fractures, or in extremity injuries inwhich skin integrity is compromised.

Extremity trauma 312 Primary ComplaintsPrimary Complaints 313Eye pain, redness and visual loss Scope of the problem Eye complaints are very frequent in the emergency department (ED), although the actual number ofvisits per year is not known. Patients may com-plain of redness, swelling, pain, foreign bodysensation, flashing lights, floating spots, visualfield defects, blurred and /or decreased vision. The diagnoses may be common and benign, such asallergic conjunctivitis, or uncommon and vision-threatening, such as acute angle closure glaucoma(AACG), corneal ulcers, or central retinal arteryocclusion (CRAO). Careful attention to the historyand physical examination helps delineate theproblem and define the treatment. Anatomic essentials The bony structure of the orbit is formed by a con-fluence of the frontal, maxillary, and zygomatic bones. The walls of the orbit are referred to by theiranatomic location: superior, inferior, medial, andlateral. The inferior orbital wall or plate is quitethin and often fractured following a direct blowto the globe or orbit. The eyelids, the lacrimalgland (tucked away under the upper lid), and thecanalicular system that drains tears into the nasalcavity make up the adnexal structures of the eye(Figure 21.1). The globe (Figure 21.2) is divided into two sections: the anterior and the posterior segment.The anterior segment includes the cornea, limbal conjunctiva, iris, anterior chamber, andthe lens. The conjunctiva is a thin, transparentmucus membrane that covers the sclera (bulbarconjunctiva) and the inner surface of the eyelids(palpebral conjunctiva). The sclera is a toughlayer of collagen and elastic fiber that surroundsthe entire globe with the exception of the cornea.The sclera gives the eye its white appearance. Thecornea is made up of a dense layer of collagen500-600 /H9262m thick. It consists of 5 layers including Bowman's and Decemet's membranes. The corneais the anterior-most aspect of the eye. It is transparent and allows light to be transmittedand focused through the pupil. The iris is adiaphragm anterior to the lens and is responsiblefor eye color. It has two layers: the stromal andthe pigmented layers. The iris has two ofmuscles: the constrictor and the dilator muscles,that are innervated by separate nerves. The pupil21 Eye pain, redness and visual loss Janet G. Alteveer, MD Lacrimal gland Sclera Lateral of the and adnexal structures. Lacrimal gland is situated superotemporally.

The trabecular meshwork, located anteriorto the iris insertion in a circumferential patternaround the globe, filters and removes the aqueoushumor; malfunction can result in elevated intraoc-ular pr essure (IOP). The ciliary body , to the iris in an inner-tube configurationcircumferentially around the globe, has two mainfunctions: 1.Production of aqueous humor, a transparent protein-free liquid contained in the anteriorand posterior chambers that provides oxygenand nutrients to the avascular cornea and lens. 2.Control of accommodation by changing theshape of the crystalline lens. The lens sitsbehind the iris and is responsible for focusinglight upon the retina. When the ciliary bodycontracts, the lens thickens, increasing theeye's ability to focus up close. When lookingat a distant object, the ciliary body relaxes andthe lens becomes thinner, adjusting the eye'sfocus for distance vision. The lens thickens and becomes less compressiblewith age, and is the site of cataract formation.The lens also establishes the anterior boundaryof the posterior chamber. The posterior segment of the globe contains the vitreous humor, choroid, retina, and opticnerve. The vitreous humor is a clear hydrogel that fills the vitreous cavity. It is 98-99% water on a collagen framework. The choroid is the vascularstructure between the sclera and the retina's pigmented epithelium. It is responsible for cool- ing the retina, which has a high metabolic rateand the highest blood flow per gram of tissue inthe human body. The retina contains 10 layersand is a complex interplay of neuronal elements,supporting tissue, photoactive cells, and bloodvessels. When the rods and cones absorb lightenergy, an electrical potential is created. This isthen amplified and conducted through the opticnerve to the occipital cortex. The nerve fiber layer of the retina enters the optic disk of the opticnerve, makes a 90\u00b0 turn posteriorly, and exits theglobe. The optic disk (optic nerve head) is alsoreferred to as the blind spot. The optic nerve is a bundle of myelinated nerve fibers that exits theglobe through the superior orbital fissure. The eye is under the influence of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous sys-tems. The sympathetic fibers exit the spinal cordwith the T11-T12 outflow. These fibers thentravel up the neck in the sympathetic plexus tothe nasociliary and long ciliary nerves. Thesenerves innervate the of the iris.Increased sympathetic tone results in pupillarydilation. Horner's syndrome, an interruption ofthese sympathetic fibers, often apical lungtumor, results in pupillary constriction (miosis).The parasympathetic fibers chamberCorneaSuspensory ligamentCiliary bodyOra serrata The globe in cross section. The iris diaphragm outlines the margins of the pupil. The anteriorsurface of the lens abuts the posterior surface of the iris.

Increased parasympathetic tone causespupillary constriction. Compression or injury ofthe oculomotor nerve results in pupillary dilation. History Is your eye red? Injection of the conjunctiva is a finding shared by many infectious, inflammatory, and aller-gic conditions. Eye redness alone does not dis-tinguish vision-threatening from benign eye conditions. Does your eye hurt? How would you describe the pain? Asharp pain, accompanied by the sensation that something is in the eye, is characteristic of corneal foreign bodies, corneal abrasions, infections, orulcers. Pain made worse by light or accommoda-tion is typical of acute anterior uveitis. Deeperpain often accompanies inflammation of thesclera or anterior uvea. A deep boring pain madeworse by movement of the eyeball is often pres-ent in optic neuritis, while severe pain accompa-nied by a headache on the same side is commonin acute angle closure glaucoma (AACG). Theabsence of pain is significant - acute conjunctivi-tis is almost never painful. Is your eye sensitive to light? Photophobia and increased pain on exposure to bright light suggests anterior uveitis. It iscaused by spasm of the ciliary muscle that mayaccompany corneal abrasions, blunt trauma tothe eye, infections, or inflammatory processes.Certain corneal abrasions or keratitis may causelight sensitivity, as the incident light irritates theeye due to refraction. How is your vision? Benign conditions such as bacterial, viral, or aller- gicconjunctivitis generally do not affect visual acuity. Mild to moderate vision loss may Severe deficits mayoccur with optic neuritis, AACG, central retinalartery veinocclusion (CRVO), central corneal abrasions, orulcers. A halo around lights is characteristic ofacute glaucoma, while loss of color vision is com-mon in optic neuritis. Have you noticed a discharge and what is it like? Apurulent discharge is pathognomonic of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. Patients often wake up with their lids and lashes crusted together, andmay need to apply warm water to remove thecrust and open their eyes. The discharge of gono-coccal (GC) conjunctivitis is so profuse that it isdescribed as welling up as soon as it is wipedaway. By contrast, adenoviral infections produce acopious watery discharge. These patients oftendescribe a clear puddle on their pillow. Chlamydiainfection and certain types of allergic conjunctivi-tis produce a mucoid discharge. Neither scleritis,anterior uveitis, glaucoma, nor optic neuritisresult in discharge. It is important to differentiate tearing in response to pain or light from discharge. Is there any itching? The presence of itching is a hallmark for an aller- gic process. How long has your eye been bothering you? Patients with a corneal foreign body or abrasion are usually able to tell you the moment their prob-lem began. Acute angle closure glaucoma often occurs at night, or after emerging from a darkenedlocation - dilation of the pupil in response todecreased light often precipitates the crisis.Bacterial conjunctivitis often occurs overnight. Table 21.1 Glossary of terms Conjunctivitis Inflammation of the conjunctiva Keratitis Inflammation of the cornea Anterior uveitis Inflammation of the iris and ciliary body (also called iritis) Scleritis Inflammation of the sclera Episcleritis Inflammation of the subconjunc-tival tissue and blood vessels Blepharitis Inflammation of the eyelids Oculus dexter Right eye Oculus sinister Left eye Ocular uterque Both eyesAmore indolent onset is typical of inflammatory processes, such as scleritis, uveitis, or optic neuritis. Is it one eye or both eyes? Corneal foreign body, abrasion, acute glaucoma, central retinal artery or vein occlusion, optic neu-ritis, periorbital and orbital cellulitis (respectively,POC and OC) generally develop in one eye.Conjunctivitis, both bacterial and viral, may startin one eye and rapidly spread to the other.Inflammatory conditions such as thyroid-relatedophthalmopathy, scleritis, and allergic conjunc-tivitis are generally bilateral. Have you had a recent exposure to someone with a red eye? Adenoviral infections often present in epidemic form, often in schools, dormitories, military bar-racks, and swim clubs. HSV , gonorrhea, andchlamydia infections are transmitted via directcontact. Do you wear contact lenses? Contact lens wearers are at increased risk of corneal infections and ulcers (infectious kerati-tis or epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, EKC). A\"simple\" corneal abrasion in a contact lenswearer can progress overnight to a vision-threat-ening ulcer if the appropriate history is notobtained. Contact lens users are also at risk forrare parasitic infections. Did you rub your eye? Rubbing the eye may result in a mechanical corneal abrasion. Were you hit in the eye? Traumatic anterior uveitis may develop several days after a blow to the eye. These patients will complain of pain, tearing, and photophobia, butmay forget to tell you about the trauma. Eyetrauma accompanied by visual impairment is anophthalmologic emergency. What kind of work do you do? Machinists, drill workers, those who do any type of metal-on-metal work are at risk for metallicforeign bodies. Welders, boaters, and skiers, par-ticularly those who do not use proper eyewear,are at risk for ultraviolet (UV) burns to the cornea.Are you using any eye drops? Allergic conjunctivitis may develop from the use of certain eye preparations, particularly those con-taining neomycin. Patients who are on long-term topical steroid drops are at risk for glaucoma orcataracts. Have you ever had this before? Thirty percent of patients with HSV infection will have a recurrent episode. Allergic phenomenaand some inflammatory conditions (such as scle-ritis or optic neuritis) can remit and recur. Do you use eye make-up? Contamination of mascara and liquid eyeliners may result from or occur due to bacterial or viralconjunctivitis. This is especially true with sharedproducts. Patients with these conditions shouldbe counseled to discard these products. Have you had recent eye surgery? Recent eye surgery has been associated with acute keratitis as well as endophthalmitis (asevere vision-threatening infection of the globe). Do you have any chronic medical conditions? Immunosuppression is associated with fungal infections. Rheumatoid arthritis and systemiclupus erythematosus (SLE) are associated withscleritis. There is an association between multi-ple sclerosis (MS) and optic neuritis. Physical examination The physical examination of the eye and sur-rounding structures is critical to narrowing the differential diagnosis. It needs to be conducted ina systematic fashion. Vital signs Acomplete set of vital signs is essential. Note whether the patient is febrile, tachycardic, orhypertensive. Patients with glaucoma may bedehydrated from the nausea and vomiting thatoften accompanies this condition. Fever may be aclue to an infectious process. Hypertension andvisual loss may point to a vascular etiology. Eye pain, redness and visual loss 316 Primary ComplaintsVisual acuity This is the vital sign of the eye and must be recorded on every patient with an eye complaint. It may be obtained using the following sequence. Snellen eye chart This standard chart, using progressively smaller letters, is found on a wall in every ED and manyprimary care offices. It should be used for allpatients who are able to stand and follow simpleinstructions. Patients who regularly wear glasses(other than for reading) should wear them for theexamination. This should be noted in the chart.Cover one eye and have the patient begin identi-fying the largest letters. Repeat with the othereye and then both eyes together. For non-readersa \"tumbling E\" chart may be used. Patients indi-cate with their hands which way the E is facing.Achart with pictures is often used for children and serves the same purpose. Note the smallestrow in which the patient is able to correctly iden- tify more than half the letters/symbols. Recordthe visual acuity as the number of this row under20 (i.e., 20 /30 OD, 20 /40 OS, 20 /30 OU). Near chart For those too sick to stand, a \"near card\" held 14 inches from the face may be used, followingthe same procedure as with the Snellen chart. Pinhole testing or ophthalmoscope If the patient wears corrective lenses and does not have them with him/her, or to ascertain if thevisual deficit can be corrected mechanically, uti-lize pinhole testing or a handheld ophthalmo-scope. Ask the patient to read the eye chart whilelooking through the pinhole or have the patientlook at a near chart through a handheld ophthal-moscope. Ask the patient to \"dial\" the ophthal-moscope until they can see the letters and recordthe setting (i.e., 20 /40 using lens /H1100210). If either method corrects the visual deficit, the problem isoptical and not pathologic. Gross visual acuity testing In patients with vision less than 20 /400, gross visual acuity may be quantified in terms of the patient's ability to count fingers, detect handmotion (waving), or perceive light.Orbit and adnexal structures Inspect the orbits and the tissue around the eyesfor redness, swelling, lesions (i.e., vesicular erup-tion from an HZV infection), and asymmetry.Proptosis (protruding eye) suggests that anorbital infection, inflammation, or tumor is forc-ing the eye forward (Figure 21.3). This conditionis best assessed looking from above the headdownward toward the eyes. Keratoconus differsfrom proptosis in that the cornea is cone-shapedwhile the globe does not protrude. Examine theeyelashes carefully for crusting, lashes pointingin the wrong direction, or lice. Ocular motility It is particularly important to evaluate the motil-ity of the globe in cases of eye trauma, suspectedinfection, and double vision. While standingdirectly in front of the patient, have them holdtheir head still and follow your finger with theireyes. Study the movement of one eye at a time asyou move your finger first up and down, andthen from side to side. The extraocular muscles(EOMs) responsible for eye movements are inner-vated by cranial nerves III, IV , and VI (Figure 21.4, Table 21.2). Entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle within a fracture of the inferior orbital plate may resultfrom a direct blow to the eye. Orbital infection,tumor, inflammation, compression, or ischemiaof the individual nerves anywhere from the eyeto the brainstem, or by aneurysms of the circle ofWillis, may result in diplopia. Monocular diplopia Primary Complaints 317Eye pain, redness and visual loss Figure 21.3 Orbital cellulitis. Presenting with massive swelling,chemosis, erythema, and poor ocular motility.Reproduced with permission from Tasman W et al, WillsEye Hospital Atlas of Clinical Ophthalmology, 2nd ed.,Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2001.is usually the result of problems of the cornea, iris, lens, or retina of that particular eye, and isalmost always pathologic. Pupillary Note the size, shape, and symmetry of the pupilsand their reaction to direct light. An asymmetricor teardrop-shaped pupil following trauma mayindicate injury to the iris or a ruptured globe.Topical medications can affect the size of the pupil. Sympathomimetic (tropicamide) and anti-cholinergic drops (homatropine or scopolamine),also in pupillary constriction.The swinging flashlight test The swinging flashlight test is used to test for \"paradoxical\" pupillary dilation in response tolight. Abnormal results are referred to as a rela-tive afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) or a Marcus- Gunn pupil involving the affected eye (Figure21.5). This test is performed in a darkened roomby shining a bright light in the patient's eye for1-2 seconds followed by swinging the light to Eye pain, redness and visual loss 318 Primary Complaints OD 20/20 OS 20/200 (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 21.5 Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD).

(b) Light directed into the left eye results in apartial and sluggish contraction in each eye. (c) Lightdirected into the right eye results in a brisk and normalreaction in each eye. (d) The light quickly redirected intothe left eye results in a dilatation of both pupils. It ispossible to detect RAPD even in the presence of adilated, dysfunctional pupil, as in a traumatic mydriasis or cranial nerve III palsy, by observing the other pupil.Reproduced with permission from Tasman W et al, Wills Eye Hospital Atlas of Clinical Ophthalmology, 2nd ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2001.SR CN3SRCN3 Depiction of extraocular muscle innervation by cranialnerves III, IV, VI, and the direction of eye movements thatresult with contraction of the page 199, ISBN 0 521 00980 4, Principles and Practice of Emergency Neurology , Eds Shah SM, Kelly KM.

A normal physiologicresponse is constriction of the pupil with direct light stimulation. Pupillary dilation in responseto direct light stimulation indicates an afferent(sensory) visual lesion, most commonly an optic neuropathy. Failure of pupil to constrict witheither direct or consensual light stimulation indi-cates an efferent pupillary defect. Anisocoria Lesions that result in anisocoria (unequal pupils) include: 1.Adie's tonic pupil : A dilated pupil that responds poorly to direct light but will constrict with accommodation. The lesion is in the cranial nerve III ciliary ganglion,usually the result of a viral infection or localinflammation. 2.Argyll-Robertson pupil : A small irregular pupil that reacts poorly to light. It developsover months to years and is associated with central nervous system (CNS) syphilis. 3.Horner's syndrome : A miotic pupil that reacts to light. There is often accompanying ptosis of the lid of the affected side as well as anhydrosis of the ipsilateral face. It is the result of sympathetic denervation from apical lung tumors, trauma to the spinal cord, brainstem lesions, orsyringomyelia. 4.Essential anisocoria : A small percentage of the population has unequal pupils of idiopathicetiology. 5.Factitious dilated pupil : Occasionally a patient will self-medicate with anticholinergic drops (scopolamine or homatropine). Theywill present with a fixed and dilated pupil.The administration of two drops of 1% pilocarpine can be diagnostic, as a\"normal\" pupil will constrict over45 minutes, while a \"medicated\" pupil will remain dilated. Visual fields Visual field testing will detect disorders affecting the retina, optic nerve, optic chiasm, and visualcortex. Patients with visual complaints (irrespec-tive of their visual acuity) should always bescreened for visual field defects. Confrontationalvisual fields are measured for one eye at a timeand can detect segmental retinal detachments(often a horizontal defect) or intracranial pathol-ogy (usually a vertical defect obeying the mid-line). Care must be taken to ensure that thenon-examined eye of the patient is completelycovered. The visual field examination may detecta central scotoma, common in optic neuritis, alocalized defect due to a retinal detachment, orbitemporal hemianopsia indicative of a lesionaffecting the optic chiasm, such as a pituitarytumor (Figure 21.6). Anterior segment General inspection and slit lamp examinationwill detect abnormalities of the anterior segment,including the conjunctiva, sclera, cornea, iris, lens,and anterior chamber. The conjunctiva and thesclera should be examined for discharge, injection,chemosis (swelling), or foreign bodies. When dis-charge is present, its amount, quality, and colorshould be noted. The pattern of erythema (gener-alized vs. focal) should also be noted. Acute con-junctivitis usually results in diffuse erythema,while cases of anterior uveitis present with rednesslargely around the cornea (perilimbic erythema).The white sclera may become very thin in scleri-tis, resulting in a bluish hue to the eye. Topical anesthetics Patients with eye pain, infection, inflammation, or foreign body often require the application of atopical anesthetic to facilitate the examination.Instill a few drops of a preparation such as 0.5%proparacaine in the inferior palpebral sulcus.Prompt relief of symptoms following applicationof a topical anesthetic is almost diagnostic of a corneal abrasion. Never dispense a topicalanesthetic for outpatient use; extended applica-tion has been associated with persistent cornealdefects, infections, ulcers, and increased risk ofadditional trauma. Eyelid eversion After instillation of a topical anesthetic, the eye- lids should be everted to look for adherent for-eign bodies. With the patient looking down,apply a cotton-tipped applicator to the mid-por-tion of the upper lid. Gently grab the upperlashes and pull the eyelid over the applicator.When the patient then looks up, this actionreverses the eversion.

(2) A lesion of the optic chiasm may cause a bitemporal hemianopia. (3) A lesion at the junction of the right opticnerve and the chiasm results in a central scotoma in the right eye and a superior visual fielddefect that respects the vertical meridian in the left eye. This effect results from compromise ofthe inferior nasal crossing fibers from the left eye, which extend into the prechiasmal portion ofthe right optic nerve (i.e., Wilbrand's knee). The resulting visual field defect is known as ajunctional scotoma, which is localized at the junction of the optic nerve and chiasm.

This results in an inferior homonymous quadrantanopia. (8) Complete interruption of theoptic may spare the macula. Subtotaloccipital lesions produce exquisitely congruous visual field defects because the fibers are morehighly segregated in the occipital area. (10) Lesions affecting the posterior portion of the occipitallobe may spare the more anteriorly placed unpaired crossing peripheral nasal retinal fibers,resulting in a preserved temporal crescent in an otherwise congruous homonymous hemianopia.(11) Focal lesions involving the anterior-most portion of the occipital lobe may affect thereceptive area for the unpaired crossing fibers from the contralateral nasal retina, resulting in aunilateral peripheral temporal visual field defect.

Normally, the anterior chamberis optically clear. However, careful inspectionunder magnification may reveal proteinaceousdebris (flare), red blood cells (hyphema), orpurulent exudate (hypopyon). Flare resembles amotion projector beam in a dark smoky room.The presence of cells and flare in the anteriorchamber is commonly associated with anterioruveitis (also known as iritis or iridocyclitis). The oblique flashlight test This test estimates the depth of the anterior cham- berof the eye, and may demonstrate a narrow or closed angle in AACG (Figures 21.7 and 21.8). Apenlight is held to the side of the patient's head, with the beam parallel to the iris and shin-ing across the anterior chamber. If the entire irisis illuminated, the \"angle\" is open. If there is ashadow projected on the nasal part of the iris, the\"angle\" is narrow or closed. If the cornea of theaffected eye is too hazy to perform this test effec-tively, perform it on the other eye. While AACGusually occurs in only one eye, both eyes willhave \"narrow\" or \"closed\" angles. Fluorescein staining The cornea should be examined for clarity, surface irregularities, and foreign bodies. Fluorescein dyeis used to identify epithelial defects of the cornea.After the application of a topical anesthetic, a flu-orescein-coated strip is lightly applied to thelower conjunctival sulcus, and the patient is askedto blink a few times. The damaged corneal epithe-lium picks up the dye and fluoresces brightlywhen the cornea is examined with a cobalt bluelight (Figure 21.9). The slit lamp provides superior visualization of any epithelial defects. Fluorescein staining will identify scratches from a foreignbody, corneal ulcers (Figure 21.10), as well as the\"grape-like clusters\" of herpetic infections (den-drites) (Figure 21.11). Removal of to fluorescein will preventpermanent staining.

The fundoscopic examination may be facilitated by dilation of the pupils with topical mydriatics(e.g., tropicamide) or cycloplegics (e.g., cyclopen-tolate). Prior to inducing pupillary dilation, patients should have a complete pupillary exam-ination and be screened for contraindications todilation of the pupil, such as suspicion of globerupture, history of angle closure glaucoma, or narrow anterior angles.Fundoscopy may reveal abnormalities of the retina, optic nerve, or vitreous cavity. Adiminished red reflex may result from cornealedema, cataract formation, vitreous hemorrhage,or a large retinal detachment. A classic (late) find-ing in Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)is a pale retina with a \"cherry red spot\" the spared blood supply to the fovea (Figure21.12). Venous congestion and hemorrhage maybe evident in Central Retinal Vein Occlusion(CRVO), with the retina being described as hav-ing a \"blood and thunder\" appearance (Figure21.13). Some patients with optic neuritis maypresent with edema of the optic disk. The fundo-scopic evidence of a retinal detachment mayexplain a patient's sudden visual loss (Figure21.14). Any patient with acute vision lossthought to be due to posterior segment diseaseshould be referred immediately to an ophthal-mologist for a further evaluation.

These techniques require topical anesthesia prior to direct application of the device over the surface of the cornea. Measurement of IOP istherefore contraindicated in cases of globe rup-ture or infections. Normal IOP's range between12 and 21 mmHg. People who have pressuresbetween 21 and 30 mmHg with normal opticdisks have ocular hypertension. While any value over 30 mmHg is abnormal, a measure-ment of greater than 50 mmHg suggests acuteglaucoma. General physical The general physical examination is used to assessthe overall health of the patient and is importantto search for clues to the nature of the eye prob-lem. Joint deformities may indicate a connectivetissue disease, while signs of malnourishmentmay indicate chronic or acute immunosuppres-sion. The skin should be examined for lesionsthat may indicate systemic infection or autoim-mune disorders.

Vision loss 1.Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) : This test should only be ordered if the clinical suspicion of temporal (giant cell) arteritis is high. Ask the patient about the nature and location of headache; presence of scalptingling, jaw claudication, temporal arterytenderness and throbbing; unexplainedweight loss in the presence of visual acuityloss or field defect. In this scenario, aerythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 50 in an older individual in the clinical setting of headache and/or visualchange is highly suggestive of temporalarteritis. 2.Electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN),creatinine : A patient with AACG may have electrolyte abnormalities or dehydration from nausea and vomiting. 3.Glucose, lipid profile : Diabetes and hyperlipidemias are associated with CRAO. Radiologic studies Computed tomography (CT) be useful in delineating infec-tious, inflammatory, and malignant processes.CT will differentiate between a POC (superficial)and OC (deep). It will also define any co-existingconditions, such as sinusitis, abscess, or tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often used to evaluate for optic neuritis, primarily tolook for demyelinating lesions of Multiple Sclerosis(MS). As many as 40% of individuals determinedto have MS initially present with symptoms ofretrobulbar or optic neuritis. In this setting, the MRI does not have to be done emergently. MRI iscontraindicated in patients with metallic intraoc-ular or intraorbital foreign bodies because of therisk of further injury from movement of theseobjects.General treatment principles Treatment of eye disorders is predicated on the specific diagnosis. The red eye Common disorders not requiring specialty care . Allergic conjunctivitis Treatment depends on the etiology. For example, in individuals sensitive to cat dander, avoidance of the allergen may be all that is required. Topicalover-the-counter vasoactive drops, oral antihist-amines, or both may help in the short run. Mastcell stabilizer ophthalmic drops are effective, butusually take 2 weeks to exert any effect. Bacterial conjunctivitis While generally considered benign and self- limited, the course of bacterial conjunctivitis canbe shortened by the use of broad-spectrum topi-cal antibiotics. Inexpensive drops such as sulfac-etamide or gentamicin are perfectly acceptable.The decision of which agent to use is based oncost, availability, local resistance patterns, andlocal practice. Neomycin preparations should beavoided because of the high incidence of allergicconjunctivitis. Blepharitis Treatment includes a daily regimen of lid hygiene, including warm compresses, lid massage, and cleaning of the lids with diluted (1 : 10) babyshampoo. Chalazion Warm compresses for 15 minutes 4 times daily. The use of antimicrobial ointments is controversial; they are not recommended in ophthalmologytexts, but are commonly used in practice. Steroidinjection and elective excision should be left tothe ophthalmologist. Corneal abrasions Corneal abrasions are commonly treated with a short-course of topical broad spectrum antibioticointment and short-acting topical cycloplegics(cycopentolate). Topical non-steroidal anti-inflam-matory dr ug (NSAID) preparations significantly Primary Complaints 327Eye pain, redness and visual lossEye pain, redness and visual loss 328 Primary Complaintsreduce the pain associated with corneal abra- sions. Oral narcotic pain medications may also be prescribed for patient comfort. Corneal abra-sions associated with contact lens use should notbe patched due to an increased risk of Pseudomonas infections. These corneal abrasions should betreated with broad-spectrum good anti-pseudomonal coverage (gentam-icin, polymixin/bacitracin, or tobramycin). Tetanusstatus should be investigated and updated as needed. Under no circumstances should the patient be prescribed outpatient topical anesthetics. Episcleritis Topical or oral NSAIDs are often effective for episcleritis. Hordeolum (stye) Warm compresses as for chalazion. Topical antibiotics should be prescribed if the inflamma- tion extends beyond the immediate area of thestye. Surgical drainage with an 18-G needle orNo. 11 blade may speed resolution if the horde-olum is already pointing, but runs the danger of scarring if done incorrectly (i.e., on the externallid surface). Only if the stye is pointing directlyinto the lid margin and affecting vision should it be drained, and only by someone with experience. Superficial keratitis Broad-spectrum topical antibiotics, cycloplegics (if associated anterior uveitis is present) and oralpain medication usually control the symptomsand generally prevent complications. Viral conjunctivitis There is no specific treatment for viral conjunc- tivitis. Adults who are capable of good hygienemay return to work if they have a negative directfluorescent antibody (DFA) test to the viruseswhich cause EKC. In the presence of a positiveDFA for EKC, the patient should remain off workfor 2 weeks to control the spread of this debilitat-ing disease. Children who cannot wash theirhands meticulously need to be kept home fromschool. The following conditions threaten vision and require immediate consultation.Acute angle closure glaucoma If untreated, acute angle closure glaucoma will result in blindness. The initial treatment targets lowering the IOP . Accepted components of acutemedical or IV acetazolamide. Acetazolamideshould be avoided or given with caution inpatients with significant pulmonary diseasebecause of the combined effects of metabolic andrespiratory acidosis. IV mannitol is effective in lowering IOP , but is relatively contraindicated inpatients with congestive heart failure (CHF) orrenal failure because of the significant osmotic load. Immediate consultation with an ophthal-mologist is necessary. Reduction of the IOP maytake hours, and repeated installation of medica-tions to achieve lowering of IOP is mandatory,under close management by an ophthalmologist. Anterior uveitis Topical steroids are the mainstay of therapy. As steroids (Prednisolone) themselves are associated with complications (cataract formation, glaucoma,and pupillary abnormalities), they should only beprescribed after consultation with an ophthalmol-ogist. Intermediate-acting cycloplegics, such ashomatropine or scopolamine, are used to alleviateciliary spasm, which is responsible for much ofthe pain associated with anterior uveitis. Corneal ulcers Immediate referral to an ophthalmologist is nec- essary. Never attempt to treat a suspected cornealulcer without ophthalmologic consultation. Themedicolegal ramifications of undertreated dis-ease are antivirals and topical antibiotics (to prevent a secondary bacterial infection) are used to treatthe skin lesions of HZV ophthalmicus. Topicalantivirals have not been shown to be effective.Primary Complaints 329Eye pain, redness and visual lossTopical steroids are used if anterior uveitis or deep stromal keratitis is present, although only follow- ingdirect consultation with an ophthalmologist. As 50% of division I trigeminal nerve HZV infec-tions involve the cornea and have the potentialfor scarring, these cases should be referred to anophthalmologist. Herpetic simplex keratitis For disease are effective in the vast majority of cases.When corneal ulcers are present, both an oraland a topical agent are used. Steroid prepara-tions should be used only in consultation with anophthalmologist. Oral acyclovir at prophylacticdoses has been shown to prevent recurrences ofHSV eye disease. Suspected globe rupture/perforation Shield the eye immediately and discontinue the examination. This condition is a surgical emer-gency that threatens the entire globe. Care shouldbe rapidly transferred to an ophthalmologist. Visual change or vision loss Most of these conditions require immediate or urgentophthalmologic consultation. Central retinal artery occlusion Few interventions have much effect on the gen- erally poor outcome from CRAO. While awaitingthe arrival of the ophthalmologist, some low-risk(and potentially beneficial) actions may be taken.Ocular massage (5 seconds on 5 seconds off) for15-30 minutes may manually dislodge the clot.Rebreathing carbon dioxide (CO 2) by breathing into a paper bag may result in vasodilation of thecentral retinal artery. Acetazolamide IV has alsobeen advocated as it may lower IOP . Paracentesisof the anterior chamber is no longer recom-mended as a therapeutic intervention by anemergency practitioner. Central retinal vein occlusion No specific medical therapy is effective for CRVO. Surgery and thrombolytic therapy are still con-sidered experimental. Some patients may be candidates for laser surgery. An ophthalmologistshould be involved in the care of patients withCRVO. Optic neuritis IV methylprednisolone 250 mg 4 times daily for 3 days improves the short-term visual outcome, andmay slow the progression of MS over the subse-quent 2 years. Oral prednisone is contraindicatedbecause of adverse visual outcomes. Always con-sult with an ophthalmologist or neurologist. Retinal detachment Suspected retinal detachments should be urgently referred to an ophthalmologist. No specific sight- saving therapy can be instituted in the ED.Identification of the problem and urgent consul-tation are the major services that the emergencyphysician can offer the patient. Temporal (giant cell) arteritis The suspicion of temporal arteritis and the pres- ence of visual symptoms warrants the adminis-tration of oral or parenteral steroids prior to theestablishment of a definitive diagnosis by tempo-ral artery biopsy. This condition warrants imme-diate ophthalmologic referral. Special patients Pediatric 1.Neonatal conjunctivitis : Caused by GC and HSV acquired during passage through thebirth canal; can be vision- and life-threatening. Requires a full septic workup,admission, IV antibiotics and antivirals.Chlamydia infection, acquired in the samemanner, is more benign and can be treated asan outpatient. 2.Periorbital ororbital cellulitis : Since the advent of the Haemophilus influenzae type B (HIB) vaccine, POC or OC have become much lesscommon. As H. Influenza has an aggressive nature largely due to hematogenous spread,a full septic workup and IV antibiotics arerecommended for suspected cases of POC or OC. In the post-HIB era, POC or OC haslargely become associated with sinusitis orcontiguous spread from trauma or skininfections. In patients over the age of 12months, and in the absence of orbital orintracranial involvement, POC may betreated as an outpatient if the parents are compliant and reliable follow-up can bearranged. OC still requires urgent referraland admission. 3.Kawasaki disease : A multisystem disease occuring primarily in children under 8 years.Bilateral conjunctival injection that spares theperilimbic area is one component of thedisease. The incidence of coronary arteryaneurysms, a cause of significant morbidity,can be significantly reduced by theadministration of IV gamma globulin andhigh-dose aspirin. 4.Acute dacrocystitis (AD) : Neonates, infants, and small children with AD requireadmission for IV antibiotics coveringStaphylococcus and Streptococcus bacterial species. These patients also require ear, nose,and throat (ENT) or ophthalmologicconsultation for nasolacrimal duct probing.Cases associated with facial fractures mayrequire stenting of the duct. Adults with AD may be discharged on oral antibiotics andwarm compresses with next day follow-up. 5.Congenital nasolacrimal duct chronic dacrocystitis : Chronic duct obstruction usually resolves by 1 year of age and ismanaged by instructing the parents to \"milk\"the sac and duct, which may improvedrainage. Chronic dacrocystitis requirestopical antibiotics and subsequent referral toan ophthalmologist. 6.Suspected shaken baby syndrome (child abuse) : Ophthalmology consultation should be obtained to look for retinal hemorrhages,which are pathognomonic for shaken babysyndrome in the appropriate setting. Immune compromised Patients with diabetes, hematologic malignancies,those on immunosuppressive drugs, and gener-ally debilitated individuals are susceptible tomucormycosis, an aggressive fungal infection.This infection begins in the sinuses and spreadscontiguously to the orbits. Mucormycosis pres-ents as a unilateral swelling of the eye, accompa-nied by proptosis and decreased vision. Treatmentis surgical debridement and IV antifungal agents.Immediate ophthalmologic referral is essential(Table 21.5). Disposition See Table 21.5.

Age-related vision loss: /H1102150 years, optic neuritis; /H1102265 temporal arteritis. Pitfalls Do not patch corneal abrasions associatedwith contact lens use. Do not confuse a herpetic dendrite with acorneal abrasion. Remember to measure IOP in an olderpatient with sudden onset of unilateral eyepain and redness; it may be due to acuteangle closure glaucoma. Remember to look under the lids for a foreignbody in patients with corneal abrasions. Be wary of iris prolapse in the setting ofocular trauma, which may have theappearance of a corneal foreign body. The use of any steroid preparation in the eyeshould be done with extreme caution andonly following direct consultation with anophthalmologist. Patients with corneal abrasions or injuriesshould never be prescribed (or go home with) topical anesthetic preparations. Myths All patients with red eyes and tearing needtopical antibiotics. Viral conjunctivitisrequires only attention to hygiene, and allergic conjunctivitis may respond toantihistamines, vasoactive drops, or mast cell stabilizers. Only patients with a purulent discharge should be treated with ashort course of broad-spectrum topicalantibiotics. Patching corneal abrasions are a necessarypart of treatment. This common practice iscontroversial as several studies havedemonstrated no improvement in relief ofpain with patching abrasions less than 10 mmin size. Patching the eye is specificallycontraindicated in contact lens wearers. References 1.Alteveer JG, McCans KM.

It is popularly felt to be eitherharmful in and of itself or a sign of an underlyingserious disease. Most often young, previouslyhealthy adults suffer self-limited illnesses thatare well-tolerated and respond to symptomatictherapy. Morbidity and mortality from infectiouscauses of fever rise sharply with age. As opposedto children whose temperature elevations areoverwhelmingly likely to be due to infection,adults have a broader differential of both infec-tious and noninfectious etiologies. Responses toelevated body temperature readings in the EDmust first be taken in the context of the stabilityof the patient and then regarding the presump-tive cause. Fever may not always be a componentof initial concern but may be identified on meas-urement of the initial vital signs. Patients mayalso present with a history of feeling \"feverish\"that has resolved spontaneously or with hometherapy. Disease entities that are being consideredin febrile patients cannot be ruled out simply bythe momentary absence of fever. Pathophysiology It is important to distinguish whether a hightemperature is from a fever (defined as a deliber-ate hypothalamus-controlled reflex elevation ofbody temperature) or hyperpyrexia (an uncon-trolled heat accumulation overwhelming compen-satory mechanisms). This distinction is typicallynot difficult but has important immediate diag-nostic and therapeutic implications. Antipyreticsare ineffective in hyperpyrexia, while rapid cool-ing of a patient with a febrile response mayintensify the body's efforts to reach the new setpoint temperature. In order to define fever, an understanding of \"normal\" temperatures and the circadian cycle isnecessary. A healthy, unclothed can (0.4\u00b0C). Women experience well- menstrual cycle-related temperaturechanges. Healthy elderly persons do not havelower core temperatures as is popularly believed. Temperatures vary throughout the day by as much as 3.6\u00b0F (2\u00b0C) from a trough mean oraltemperature of 97.6\u00b0F 4-6 a.m. to apeak mean of 99.4\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C) between 4 and 10p.m. The lower limit of an abnormally elevatedoral temperature may thus be considered 100\u00b0F(37.8\u00b0C). Taking into account thermometer preci-sion, fever is conservatively defined as a tempera-tureof at least 100.4-101\u00b0F (38-38.5\u00b0C). It is generally believed that the fever response has aphysiologic upper limit between 105.8\u00b0F and107.6\u00b0F rectally (41-42\u00b0C). of com-pensatory thermoregulatory mechanisms in thenormal host. Systemic fever response Normally, body temperature is controlled withina narrow range that predictably varies over thecourse of a day. Compensatory mechanismsensure thermal homeostasis through autonomicnervous control by inducing changes in smoothmuscle tone, shunting blood flow to and awayfrom peripheral vascular beds, and provok-ing heat-seeking or heat-avoidance such (lipopolysaccharides), bacterial break- down pr oducts, endotoxins, drugs, immune complexes, and activated complement factorsinduce release and inter-feron G induce the production of prostaglandinE2 (PGE2) by endothelial cells. In a vascular nucleus of the anterior hypo-thalamus, PGE2 diffuses the short distance to the neurons of the thermoregulatory center. Upon stimulation, efferent discharge increasesperipheral heat-generating processes until a new temperature set point is established. The ther-moregulatory center is also influenced directly bytoxic or hormonal mediators, or by direct cen tral nervous system (CNS) insult. Cyclooxygenase22 Fever in adults Tamas R. Peredy, MDand Gus M. Garmel, MDFever in adults 334 Primary Complaints(COX) inhibitors that suppress fever by blocking synthesis of PGE2 include aspirin, acetamino-phen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs), and COX-2 selective inhibitors. Clinically, chills (or less frequently rigors) subside within minutes of reaching the newly-established febrile set point. During the feverpeak, adults may experience a mild delirium thatis more prominent in the elderly. Myalgias andarthralgias represent increased muscle tone andcirculating inflammatory mediators. The hyper-metabolic state causes an acceleration in pulse(increased 10 beats/min/\u00b0F) and respiratoryrate. Defervescence brings about predominantlyheat-dissipating processes, including sweating,facial flushing, and the sense of being uncom-fortably warm. Experimental models confirmthat fever-inducing agents introduced directlyinto the bloodstream can generate clinical signswithin minutes (Table 22.1). The orchestrated febrile response enhances host defense mechanisms by increasing neutrophilicmigration and T-cell proliferation (cellularimmunity). Tissue levels of antiviral interferonand TNF are also increased (humoral immunity).Antibacterial substances such as cytotoxic-freeradicals are generated by polymorphonuclearcells (PMNs) in greater quantity. Iron, a bacterialgrowth substrate, is sequestered. Metabolism isshifted away from glucose toward increased pro-tein and fatty acid breakdown. This transiently more protective state comes at a cost to the host. For each degree Fahrenheit oftemperature rise, the basal metabolic rate isincreased 7%. Increased caloric demands are com-pounded by increased utilization of less efficientprotein and fat fuels. Tissue oxygen demands arealso elevated despite a temperature-induced shift-ing of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curveto the right. Tachycardia occurs from a combin-ation of direct catecholamine stimulation and rela-tive dehydration, as circulation shifts to theperiphery. The most vulnerable organ to heatinjury is the CNS. Subtle damage is first detectedas a mild delirium, especially in the elderly.Convulsions, solely as a result of fever, are rarelyseen in adults. Hyperpyrexia Hyperpyrexia represents a critical imbalance ofheat-producing and heat-dissipating processes,and should be considered at temperatures above105\u00b0F (40.5\u00b0C). Spiraling temperature elevationscan occur from excess heat generation, impairedheat loss, or a direct CNS insult. The mechanismof heat rise in hyperpyrexia is independent ofpyrogenic cytokine does the thermoregulatory setpoint. Antipyretics are ineffective. Clinically,high temperatures are not seen until compensa-tory mechanisms have failed. It is important toact quickly to correct the heat imbalance beforeirreversible neurological injury, rhabdomyolysis,cardiac dysrhythmias, and circulatory collapseoccur (Table 22.2). Table 22.1 Common causes of fever Infectious Noninfectious Viruses Allergic reactions Bacteria CNS injuryFungi Inflammatory conditionsParasites Medications NeoplasmHyperthyroidismThromboembolic disease Table 22.2 Causes of hyperpyrexia Excess heat Impaired heat loss CNS dysfunction Exertional heat stroke Classic heat 335Fever in adultsLocal fever response Inflammatory stimuli activate a cascade of cellu- lar and cytokine changes that assume control oflocal homeostatic mechanisms at the site of theaffected body part. These changes manifest in acharacteristic but site-specific fashion. If localcontrol is not soon achieved, a systemic febrileresponse may result. This spillover is more likely in areas with a high concentration of immuno-logically-active cells or that are richly vascular. Classically described changes of the local inflammatory response have been appreciated forcenturies. These include rubor (erythema from vasodilatation), dolor (activation of pain fibers), calor (local temperature increase), and tumor (swelling or edema). Drainage of purulent mater-ialmay also signify infection. History Patients presenting with fever represent a potential exposure risk to the health care team. Policies of universal precautions includingglove, gown, and face-shield use must be strictlyadhered to, in order to prevent direct blood-borne pathogen-laden fluid contact. Indirect contact via stethoscope, thermometer, bed rail-ing, or aerosolized droplet may transmit disease.Additional measures such as patient isolation orthe use of a negative pressure room are necessaryfor highly contagious diseases (e.g., active tuber-culosis, SARS, Ebola). The amount of history-gathering prior to the initiation of treatment must be tailored to theseverity of illness and the potential for life-threatening processes (Tables 22.3 and 22.4).How long have you been sick? What wasyour temperature, and how did you take it? Have you appreciated a daily fever pattern? General characteristics of the fever pattern, mag- nitude, and duration may be of some clinicalvalue. Continuous are seen in lobar are characteristic of endocarditis,osteomyelitis, and deep tissue abscesses. Theamplitude or maximum temperature reading isan insensitive sign for distinguishing a viral frombacterial source. Patients with high fevers tend to appear more ill and have a higher overall incidence of serious bacterial illness. Purulent complications of common viral upper respira-tory tract illness, such as sinusitis, otitis or pneu- monia often manifest following a prodrome of 3-10 days. Fevers greater than 2 week's duration should prompt an appropriate work-up, focusedon uncovering inflammatory, immunologic,endocrinologic, toxic, or iatrogenic causes.Response to antipyretics provides little value. What medications, including antibiotics, do you take? Have you recently stopped any medication? Do you take steroids? Most patients who are able to recall their medica- tion describe their daily routine. Patients typicallyomit mention of medications taken intermittently,inhalers, eye drops, oral contraceptives, non-prescription supplements, and even insulin.

All patients should be encouraged tocarry an updated list of medications and allergiesfor their own protection. Have you been exposed to individuals at home, school, or work with similarsymptoms? Do you have any special risksfor infection? It is crucial to ascertain any special circumstancesor contagion risks. These include sick householdcontacts, extended exposure at a hospital, nurs-ing home or day care facility, recent foreign travel,dietary and occupational risks, new or symptom-atic prior sexual partners, and intravenous (IV)drug habits. Although most patients can recall acolleague or friend being ill, patterns of similarsymptoms in several close contacts may be help-ful. High-risk dietary habits include the practiceof eating raw or undercooked meats or fish, homecanning, and \"direct from source\" food use (milk,honey, chickens). Do you have any chronic medical conditions that may make you susceptible to infection? Amultitude of comorbidities predispose patients to infection. This may be through the inability of the immune system to access the affected part, asin the case of peripheral vascular disease.Defenses are attenuated in individuals with dia-betes, or deliberately suppressed in organ trans-plant recipients. Patients who are asplenic haveincreased risk for infection and sepsis. Conditionsrequiring the use of glucocorticoids further diminish already vulnerable host defenses. Do you have any indwelling or implanted medical devices? Implanted medical devices have great potential for hematogenous contamination in the settingof pacemakers, breast andpenile implants, artificial joints and medicationpumps are vulnerable immediately followingsurgical placement, but diminish their seedingpotential after several months.Are your immunizations or booster shotscurrent? Immunization status is important and should include questions regarding childhood vaccineseries, subsequent titers, hepatitis B series, pneu-movax, tetanus boosters, and influenza prophy-laxis. Newer vaccines are being developed thatwill alter our current approaches to certain dis-eases. Other vaccines represent protection frombiological weapon threats. Associated symptoms Acquisition of a detailed history often points tofocal examination findings and identification ofthe source of fever (Table 22.5). Conceptually,fever is a systemic sign that forces clinicians toconsider causes anywhere from head to toe,including the skin and external sources, like drugsor drug-drug interactions. It therefore makessense to organize the approach to the history byphysiological systems as opposed to anatomicallocation. Each organ system will have characteris-tic but non-pathogen specific signs and symptoms. Past medical An extensive list of comorbidities exists thatimpede normal defense mechanisms and putpatients at special risk. These include chroniccardiopulmonary disease, cancer, chronic renalfailure, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),diabetes mellitus (DM), hemoglobinopathies, andtransplanted organs. Recent surgery, childbirth Fever in adults 336 Primary ComplaintsTable 22.5 Associated localizing symptoms by organ system Respiratory Dyspnea, cough, phlegm or sputum, pleuritic pain Gastrointestinal Nausea, vomiting, cramping, diarrhea, tissue Pain, rash, red streaks, induration, drainage Musculoskeletal Pain on movement or palpation, swelling, inability to bear weight Genitourinary Dysuria, discharge, dyspareunia, pelvic pain Head and neck Nasal drainage, tooth, throat or CNS ear pain, difficulty swallowing,confusion, neck stiffness, vomiting, headache, back painor exacerbation of chronic conditions may criti- cally lower host defenses. Prior infections recentlytreated with antibiotics are a risk factor for thedevelopment of result invaginitis or colitis. Physical examination Athorough history will often allow the clinician to concentrate on target areas of the physical exam-ination. Local inflammatory-mediated changesprovide clues to the presumptive source of fever. Ifno such associated localizing findings are identi-fied, treatment is based largely upon host factors.Young, previously healthy adults with physical examination findings consistent with benign viralillnesses such as nasal discharge, head congestion,cough, diffuse myalgias and arthralgias, or non-bloody loose stools can be safely discharged withsymptomatic therapy only. In contrast, the elderlyor immune compromised hosts with few historicalor physical examination findings require carefulconsideration for further work-up and possibleempiric antibiotic treatment. General appearance The term \"toxic-appearing\" applies to those who\"look ill from across the room.\" Behavioral cluessuch as responsiveness to voice, posture, hygiene,and energy level provide insight into the severityof illness. The inability to sit up in a stretcher orambulate to the bathroom without assistance is agross marker of functional impairment. Temperature Factors influencing temperature measurementinclude environmental conditions, testing tech-nique, anatomical site, and site-specific con-founders. The distinction of core versus shelltemperature is most important in extreme statesof hyper- and hypothermia. Invasive methods todetermine temperature are usually not necessary,but include pulmonary artery catheters, andesophageal or urinary bladder probes. Peripheraltemperatures are typically obtained from thetympanic membrane, mouth, or rectum. Meas-urements on the forehead, either by palpation orvia thermosensitive strips, as well as axillary tem-perature measurement have proved less reliable. The accuracy of an appropriately calibrated infrared tympanic thermometer is expected to bewithin 0.2\u00b0F (0.1\u00b0C) between 98\u00b0F and 102\u00b0F(37-39\u00b0C). Outside this narrow Temperatures less than 95\u00b0F (35\u00b0C)or greater than 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) should prompt theclinician to take additional measurements byalternate methods. Tympanic thermometers havegained popularity because they are noninvasiveand calibrate quickly, and do not rely on directcontact with the tympanic membrane. Errorsoccur through improper positioning, anatomicalabnormalities, cerumen, or local inflammatoryprocesses such as otitis media or externa. Manyauthors do not favor the use of the tympanicthermometer as a sensitive screen for fever in theED, especially in the elderly. Rectal, oral, and tympanic temperatures cor- relate poorly with one another. On average, rec- tal temperatures are 0.8\u00b0F (0.4\u00b0C) higher thanoral and higher Rectal temperatures are maximal at a depthof 2.5 inches (6.4 cm). Fecal impaction and shockstates may falsely reduce temperatures, whileelevated fecal bacterial counts and proctitis mayerroneously increase readings. Sublingual or oraltemperature measurements require cooperativepatients able to breathe with their mouths closed.Mastication, smoking, recently ingested foods,and respiratory distress may affect readings. Since temperatures can vary during the ED, it may be prudent to repeat temperature measure-ments. A high degree of clinical suspicion in thesetting of a normal temperature should promptat least one or more rechecks during a patient'sstay, and consideration of measurement at otheranatomical sites. Patients at the extremes of ageor with significant comorbidity may have a ser-ious infection in the absence of fever. Vital signs Review of the remaining vital signs (Chapter 1)may provide clues to the source of fever. Forexample, an increased respiratory rate with lowerthan expected oxygen saturation suggests pneu-monia or other respiratory causes of fever. Central nervous system Despite its protective barriers, devastating CNSinfections can occur as a result of direct (e.g., oti-tis media, sinusitis) or hematogenous spread of Primary Complaints 337Fever in adultspathogens. Fever may impair cognitive function, particularly in the elderly, and result in agitation ordecreased responsiveness. This makes discerninga primary CNS infection from a systemic problemvery difficult. An effort should be made to detectsigns of meningeal irritation or increased intracra-nial pressure (ICP). Meningismus , defined as pain due to irritation of the meninges that surround thebrain and spinal cord, is often a late finding, non-specific, and unreliable below 18 months of age.Maneuvers which demonstrate meningismusinclude difficulty with or resistance to neck or hipflexion. Increased ICP , if progressing slowly, maymanifest subtly as mental status or personalitychanges, bulging fontanelle, papilledema, or lessoften focal neurologic abnormalities. The absenceof signs of increased ICP or abnormal neurologicalfindings does not exclude the presence of a seriousCNS infection. Fever and an abnormal sensoriumor neurological examination should raise immedi-ate concern for meningoencephalitis and promptconsideration of empiric antimicrobial or antiviraltherapy. In the setting of a clinically suspectedCNS infection, broad-spectrum antibiotics thatcross the blood-brain barrier may be given prior tolumbar puncture (LP), and may be lifesaving.Despite controversy, IV dexamethasone has beenrecommended prior to antibiotics in cases of acute bacterial meningitis. Upper respiratory tract The upper respiratory tract is the most commonlyinfected site in humans. Colonized by diverseflora, a delicate balance exists at this strategicopening to the respiratory and digestive systems.Droplet transmission of potential pathogensupon inhalation initially seeds the nasal mucosa. Adetailed examination should include the eyes and surrounding structures, the nares, theoropharynx including teeth, gums, tonsils, andmucosal surfaces. Tender anterior cervicaladenopathy may provide clues to a current orrecent facial or oral infection. The paranasal sinuses should be gently percussed. The earcanal, tympanic membrane, mastoid bone, andposterior cervical lymph nodes should also beevaluated. It is important to remember that skinabscesses can manifest anywhere on the bodyand may be hidden behind an ear, beneath thehair, or in the perianal or rectal area. Neck stiff-ness may be a manifestation of severe pharyngi-tis or soft tissue neck abscess, or a component ofdiffuse myalgias. Palpation of the salivary andthyroid glands and auscultation of the upper air-way are part of the complete examination. Lower respiratory tract Acute bronchitis and pneumonia are commoninfections resulting from translocation of upperrespiratory flora or infrequently from aspiration of gastric contents. Other insults such as smokingrender this area extremely vulnerable to patho- genic seeding. An overall global assessment ofthe respiratory status of a patient includes his orher work of breathing (WOB), respiratory rate,pulse oximetry, and breath sounds. Normal val-ues on pulse oximetry accompanied by tachyp-nea, abnormal breath sounds, or increased WOBprovide little reassurance. Asymmetric orrhoncherous breath sounds suggest air space dis- ease, air sac collapse, or an effusion. A completelung examination includes auscultation anteri-orly, posteriorly, and axillae, with inten-tional cough, phonation, and forced exhalationto elicit sounds not otherwise heard. Sputum, ifproduced, may be collected in a sterile containerfor gram stain and culture, but is rarely helpful. Cardiovascular Apleural or pericardial rub may point to inflam- matory processes. Any new murmur, especiallyin the setting of IV drug use, should promptimmediate concern for endocarditis, as fevermay be the only symptom. Evidence of impairedcardiac function such as congestive heart failuremay indicate myocarditis. Rheumatic heart dis-ease or known cardiac valve abnormalitiesshould also be considered. Gastrointestinal Analogous to the skin, the gut represents animportant protective barrier against pathogens.Any weakening from systemic or local boweldisease can allow translocation of intraluminaldisease-causing agents. One of the first concernsis whether peritonitis is present. Reflexively- orpersistently-increased abdominal wall muscletone, worsening pain with movement of theabdomen, and the loss of bowel sounds in theappropriate setting should prompt surgical con-sultation. Evaluation of the abdomen by quad-rant can help narrow the large list of abdominalcauses of fever, taking into account significantanatomical overlap. Special consideration should Fever in adults 338 Primary Complaintsbe made to examine liver size, texture and ten- derness, gallbladder prominence and tendernesswith and without inspiration, pain isolated to theright lower quadrant or unilateral flank. A rectalexamination is invaluable in identifying a perirec-talabscess or prostatitis. The perineum should be visually inspected for soft tissue abnormalities. Genitourinary Urinary tract infections (UTIs) proceed in anascending manner from the introitus cephalad.Initially, local irritation or burning at the urethralopening can progress to classic signs of cystitisincluding dysuria, urgency, and frequency. Flankpain may represent stretch or irritation of thekidney's fibrous capsule due to pyelonephritis.Upper tract signs are not reliably present to dis-tinguish cystitis from pyelonephritis. A thoroughinspection of the foreskin, glans, skin, andscrotal structures in males, as well as inguinallymph nodes, is important. In females, a specu-lum and bimanual examination are importantgiven the high prevalence of pathogens transmit-ted by sexual intercourse. Soft tissue and musculoskeletal Diffuse transient myalgias and arthralgias arecommon to many pathogens. However, isolatedpain localized to the soft tissue or one joint shouldbe thoroughly investigated. Areas of special con-cern include the perineum, feet, and areas of con-tinuous external pressure. All debilitated patientsneed to be log-rolled on both sides using at leasttwo providers to examine these areas, especiallythe sacrum. When examining cutaneous wounds,the presence of drainage, spreading erythematousmargins, crepitus, and functional impairmentneed to be considered. Recent shaving, bodypiercing, and tattoos can be a nidus of infectionor inflammation. Skin abscesses (carbuncle,furuncle) from \"skin popping\" are most commonin the forearms of IV drug users, but abscessescan occur anywhere, including in axillae, lactatingbreast, and groin. Skin Characteristic skin lesions often accompanyfebrile adults. It is important to be familiar withproper dermatological terminology so that rashcategorization algorithms may be appropriatelyutilized. A wide variety of infectious and non-infectious processes manifest as a limited numberof skin lesions (Table 22.6). Petechiae are worri- some vasculitic lesions seen in meningococcemia,most often on the lower legs. Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of the febrile adult isprotean and includes a large number of infec-tious and noninfectious causes. Diagnostically, itis important to focus on: 1.what illness or injury may have occurred causing host vulnerability and allowing theinfection to take hold; 2.what site-specific pathogens are usuallyresponsible for disease, and exist in the local community; 3.what special exposure risks may haveoccurred from professional or personal habits. The most difficult diagnoses are in patients withsystemic illness without an obvious cause or por-tal of entry. This may prompt a broad search forsuspected causes. From an emergency provider'sperspective, it is easier to organize this search byorgan system (Table 22.7). Local Departments ofHealth require physician reporting of infectiousdiseases of public health concern.

Aspiration divided into viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic. Viral infections are the most common pathogens and include a varietyof upper respiratory, gastrointestinal, blood-borne,CNS, skin, and genital pathogens. A variety ofhemorrhagic and mosquito-borne viral illnessesare common outside the US, but do occur (WestNile Virus, Rabies). Bacterial illness is typicallydivided into Gram-positive skin and respiratoryorganisms and Gram-negative gastric and uri-nary pathogens. The disruption or translocationof ordinary flora is often the cause of disease.Encapsulated organisms pose a special threat toasplenic patients (e.g., sickle cell disease). Promptinitiation of antibiotics has greatly reduced mortality, but has also resulted in the evolutionof drug-resistant organisms. The practice of treating unknown or noninfectious illnesses with antibacterial agents in healthy adults is notjustified. Most EDs have instituted policies of universal precautions, isolation and environmental con-trols to prevent the spread of drug-resistantorganisms. Fungi can cause devastating diseasePrimary Complaints 343Fever in adultsin immunosuppressed hosts, but rarely have significant impact upon healthy individuals. Inthe US, parasitic infections are generally limitedto adverse social conditions or special occupa-tional and recreational exposures, and have special vectors of transmission. As with all infec-tious diseases, a careful exposure history includ-ing recent travel is important. Noninfectious causes of fever Medication/drug fever Often a diagnosis of exclusion, drug fever is not often made based on a single ED visit. Fevers maydevelop from the administration of irritating sub-stances that cause phlebitis, sterile abscesses, or aseptic meningitis. Other drugs may have intrin-sic properties that interfere directly in the ther-moregulatory process. A classic febrile responseto the treatment of pathogens as syphilis isthe Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. Febrile reactions to inhalational anesthetics and agents that inducered cell hemolysis can occur in those with genetic predisposition. The widely held belief that drugfever patients appear well, have a relative brady-cardia and eosinophilia, and routinely manifestcutaneous signs have not held true. The mostcommon drugs associated with drug fever arecardiovascular hyperactivity, includingfever. Exposure to neuroleptics may induce aprogressive state of fever and rigidity, althoughthis is rare. Thromboembolic disease Between one-quarter and one-third of patients with angiographically-proven pulmonary embolus(PE) will have a low-grade ( /H11021101\u00b0F or 38.5\u00b0C) fever. Many conditions that predispose patients toPE, such as malignancy, may be responsible forthis temperature elevation. No difference in feverfrequency occurs with or without complicationssuch as pulmonary infarction. The presence ofthrombophlebitis or deep venous thrombosis inthe absence of PE may also produce temperatureelevation. fever Avariety of solid organ and hematogenous neo- plasms cause persistent fever. Fever is commonamong leukemias and lymphomas due to the proliferation of neoplastic cells capable of endoge-nous pyr ogen release. Liver, CNS, and renal cell cancers also typically produce temperature ele-vations. Since both the cancer and its treatmentcause immune compromise, it is important thatinfection be ruled out. If a patient is neutropenicand develops a fever, empiric antibiotics shouldbe administered promptly, even in the absence ofany source. Inflammatory/immunological disease Diseases that induce a chronic inflammatory state that may manifest with fever include SystemicLupus Erythematosus, Juvenile RheumatoidArthritis, and Polyarteritis Nodosa. Althoughthere may be localizing signs, the systemic natureof these diseases can cause diffuse symptoms. Arelative immunodeficient state exacerbated by immunosuppressive therapy increases the risk ofinfection, particularly to Gram-negative bacteriaand fungi. A history of inflammatory bowel dis-ease raises concern for an intra-abdominal abscess.Pancreatitis can lead to a cascade of enzymaticauto-digestion and profound inflammatory-mediated third-space fluid losses resulting inshock. Many vasculitides also present with unex-plained low-grade fever. Environmental/occupational Heat stroke is divided into classic and exertional forms. Classic heat stroke typically affects decondi- tioned or elderly individuals, those with chronicmorbidity or a history of drug or alcohol use, andindividuals on medication that may exacerbatefluid losses or prevent heat dissipation. Exertional heat stroke occurs more commonly in young males involved in endurance training. Despitethe fact that exertional heat stroke patients retainthe ability to sweat, they have overwhelmed theirreparative mechanisms and require aggressive management. Metal and polymer fume feversare examples of environmental exposures thatcan masquerade as flu-like illnesses with fever.Welders are particularly at risk. Aerosolized metals induce symptoms that may be delayed by several hours, and may last 1-2 days untilexposure is discontinued. Miscellaneous Avariety of conditions causing a hypermetabolic state may present to the ED with fever. Hyperthy- roidism, pheochromocytoma, carcinoid syndrome,Fever in adults 344 Primary as anaphylaxis induce increases in the basal metabolic rate and catecholamine secretion.Other diagnoses associated with fever includehyperlipidemia and factitious fever. Diagnostic testing Laboratory tests Prior to any ancillary studies being ordered, theclinician should have a clear idea of what treat-able disease process is being ruled in or out.Objective data should be viewed as confirmatoryfor the history and physical examination. In themajority of febrile ED patients, the source of ill-ness is determined clinically, prior to objectivetesting. Examples of conditions occurring inhealthy hosts that do not require confirmatorydiagnostic testing include rhinitis, bronchitis,gastritis, and enteritis. When laboratory studies are indicated, every effort should be made to obtain adequate samplequantities of appropriate specimens. Failure tocollect specimens prior to the initiation of antimi-crobial therapy may cloud the future clinical pic-ture. Specimen types collected include blood,urine, sputum, stool, cerebrospinal fluid penile, cervical and wound andpleural or joint aspirates. Blood tests Complete blood countThe complete blood count (CBC) is the most commonly ordered laboratory test in the ED. It isneither sensitive nor specific for identification ofbacterial versus nonbacterial illness. Cutoff val-ues of white blood cell (WBC) counts greaterthan 15,000/mm 3suggest a higher likelihood of serious illness. Leukocytosis occurs first throughdemargination of existing mature WBC stores,and then by increased bone marrow productionand release of mature and immature forms (left shift). Demargination and leukocytosis ashigh as 30,000 WBC/mm 3occur of physiological stress. Emotionalupset, glucocorticosteriod use, myeloprolifera-tive disorders, and pregnancy are conditionswith baseline leukocytosis. Automated white celltyping accompanies the standard CBC report.Manual differentials that identify immature formsare generally only performed above laboratory-established total cell count cutoffs, unless specifically requested. A lower than normal WBClevel may represent transient viral bone marrowsuppression or the host's inability to mount a sig-nificant immune response. WBC counts greaterthan 40,000/mm 3can occur in severe infections but should prompt consideration for a myelodys-plastic disorder or leukemia. Most admitted patients or those undergoing specialty consultation will have a CBC drawn, asconsultants prefer to follow the WBC count as amarker of physiologic response to treatment. Inpatients who have received chemotherapy, theCBC is important to exclude neutropenia. Acute phase reactants C-reactive (CRP), serum amyloid areexamples of acute phase reactants. Pyrogeniccytokines stimulate production of this group ofproteins during the acute inflammatory process.Considerable literature now reveals these testsadd little to the clinical impression except in spe-cial circumstances. These serum markers may beuseful in following the clinical progression ofinfections such as epidural abscesses, septicarthritis, and chronic inflammatory conditions(rheumatoid or temporal arteritis). Theerythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in mm/hour is an indirect marker of the level of acutephase proteins in the blood, but suffers the samelimitations as the direct markers. Decisionsregarding treatment or disposition should not be made based solely on these tests, except in rarecircumstances. Blood cultures Blood cultures should be drawn prior to antibi- otic therapy on patients who have a likelihood ofbacteremia. Two sets of blood cultures, two bot-tles each (one anaerobic and one aerobic), with15 ml blood in each set should be drawn fromtwo distinct puncture sites. One site shouldinclude any indwelling vascular catheter. Thepositivity rate of blood cultures in the ED is sur-prisingly low (10%), thus care should be taken toorder blood cultures selectively. Blood culturesdrawn from afebrile patients are of limited value.Therefore, limit blood culture testing to patientsbeing admitted for systemic infection, patientswith impaired defenses who will be placed onempiric antibiotics, and patients who may haveuncommon or atypical bacterial growth.Primary Complaints 345Fever in adultsOther blood tests Liver function tests (LFTs), lipase and hepatitis screens should be considered in febrile patientswith right upper quadrant pain or diffuseabdominal pain. Rapid HIV testing is importantin patients who possess risk factors for HIV orpresent with a suspected opportunistic infection.Patients suspected of having an acute presenta-tion of HIV (fever, flu-like symptoms, myalgias,sore throat, adenopathy) should be tested for thep24 Antigen or viral load, as rapid HIV testingmay initially be negative. When suspectingmalaria, thin and thick smears are important forestablishing the diagnosis by direct visualizationof intracellular pathogens. Urine tests dipstickThe multi-test urine dipstick is an accurate point- of-care screening test for lower UTI in young,healthy adults. Classic symptoms of cystitis suchas dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubicpain require no further and the presence of urea-splitting bacteriarender the leukocyte esterase (LE) and nitrite tests positive in over 90% of UTIs. False readingscan occur from improper dipstick storage, poorcollection, and incorrect interpretation. Vaginitis,menses, and some medications such as Pyridiumcan confound results. Clean catch specimen col-lection is only appropriate if clinical suspicion issuch that confirmatory urine culture is notneeded. Care must be taken to consider otherinfectious and noninfectious processes that cancause pyuria, such as appendicitis. Interpretationof dipstick results cannot be read instantly uponexposure to the sample, but require colorimetricdevelopment over several minutes. Urine odorand turbidity are most often caused by calciumphosphate precipitates, and are not reliablemarkers of infection. Urine dipstick performanceis less reliable in the evaluation of abdominalpain without dysuria (lower pretest probability),early pregnancy, and high-risk hosts. Urinalysis Aformal urinalysis (UA) consists of dipstick- type interpretation performed by laboratory per- sonnel and additional microscopic examinationof cells present in a spun and/or unspun speci-men. The microscopic analysis is useful in identi-fying adequacy of sample quality and visualconfirmation of pathogens (e.g., bacteria, tricho-monads). Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common inthe elderly, especially among institutionalizedmales, and requires no intervention. Patients whohave an ileal conduit for urinary diversion havechronic pyuria even in the absence of infection. Urine culture The urine culture represents the gold standard for detecting bacteria in urine. Urine cultures areperformed routinely according to predeterminedlaboratory protocols on abnormal UAs unlessotherwise specified. The practice of obtainingurine culture irrespective of host factors, dipstickresults, and specificity of lower urinary symp- toms is unnecessarily costly. Definitions of trueurinary tract infection vary, but are most oftenconsidered to be the growth of 10 5colony-forming units (CFUs) of a single species. Counts below10 5CFUs may represent contaminants or chronic colonization. Some authors suggest that, giventhe link between UTI and fetal demise in earlypregnancy, all symptomatic pregnant patientshave urine cultures done regardless of UA results.Patients with chronic indwelling suprapubic orbladder catheters are often colonized with bacte-ria and represent a special diagnostic challenge. Other urine tests The qualitative urine pregnancy test may have importance regarding antibiotic treatment choices.Anumber of antibiotic classes are contraindi- cated during pregnancy. It is important to checkthe pregnancy and lactation safety informationfor every drug given to pregnant or nursingmothers. Other specimen tests StoolBacterial enteritis is uncommon in the US unlike other parts of the world. Stool specimens aretherefore not necessary in the setting of a well-appearing patient with diarrhea. Fever, abdominalcramping, bloody diarrhea, immune compromise,and recent foreign travel make a bacterial causemore likely. Potential exposure to pathogens, suchas a history of a recent camping, may prompt fur-ther testing. Fecal leukocyte detection (entero-invasive disease) represents the best screening testfor a potential bacterial cause of diarrheal illness.Fever in adults 346 Primary ComplaintsRoutine stool cultures can identify common bacterial pathogens including Campylobacter,Salmonella, and Shigella. Special specimen pro-cessing is necessary to serotype Escherichia coli 0157:H7. Stool ova and parasites can be ordered ifGiardia or other parasites are suspected. Clostridium difficile toxin detection should be checked in patients with possible toxic colonic bacterialovergrowth due to recent antibiotic use. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Lumbar puncture is necessary in all patients with suspected CNS infection, especially those withfever, altered sensorium, headache, neurologicchanges, meningismus, or localized spinal ten-derness. At least 10 ml of CSF should be collectedwith care not to contaminate the specimen withskin flora. Repeated puncture attempts increasethe likelihood of a bloody tap, which may dimin-ish the interpretation accuracy (Table 22.8). Throat swab and culture The detection of group A beta-hemolytic Strepto- coccus (GABHS) historically has been important given heart in the absenceof upper respiratory infection (URI) symptomssuch as cough or coryza. Patients younger than35 years of age are at greatest risk for the devel-opment of RHD from serotypes of GABHS nowvery uncommon in the US. Young patients withat least intermediate probability for strep pharyn-gitis in the absence of symptoms suggestive of viral illness should undergo rapid antigen test-ing (rapid Strep screen). A second swab for throatculture is simultaneously collected, as confirma-tory throat cultures should be sent if the screen isnegative. Positive results of either warrant treat-ment that can be delayed up to one week withoutincreased risk of RHD. Contrary to popular belief,antibiotics provide little symptomatic relief.Sexually transmitted infections, such as gonor-rhea, can manifest as pharyngitis (see below). Genital swabs Mucosal surfaces have the potential to become infected through sexual contact. A low thresholdto test for disease should be maintained for high-prevalence diseases such as Chlamydia,Trichomonas, Gonorrhea, and Syphilis among sexually-active teenagers and adults. Patientsmay be infected for long periods of time despiteno or few symptoms. Failure to treat sexual part-ners and medication noncompliance representthe greatest challenges to prevent disease recur-rence. Traditional endocervical collection and cul- turepractices are being replaced by methods of rapid urine detection with deoxyribonucleic acid(DNA) probes and amplification techniques.Herpetic vesicular lesions can be treated basedupon their classic clinical appearance. Ulcerativeareas should be vigorously cultured prior to theinitiation of prophylactic antibiotics. Scrapingsof fluid or tissue lesions can be sent for specialtesting, such as culture, direct fluorescent antibody(DFA), or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA). Joint aspiration Localized pain, erythema, and swelling of a joint causing painful limited range of movement inthe setting of systemic fever should prompt con-sideration of a septic joint until proven other-wise. Aspiration and analysis of synovial fluid iscrucial to the diagnosis, and can help distinguishsterile processes such as aseptic synovitis or crys-tal arthropathy from an infectious cause. Bedsideultrasound may guide sample collection. Jointaspirates should be tested for cell type and count,the presence of bacteria on Gram's stain, culture,and crystals under polarizing microscopy. Leuko-cyte counts greater than 50,000/mm 3are likely the result of infection, and should prompt imme-diate antibiotics and orthopedic consultation.Cultures have a high rate of detection of Staphylo- coccus and Streptococcus , but are less sensitive for gonorrhea.Table 22.8 Lumbar puncture order set Tube 1 Cell count and differential Tube 2 Protein, glucose Tube 3 Gram's stain, bacterial culture, viral culture (herpes, etc.) Tube 4 India Ink, cryptococcal antigen, bacterialantigen (CIE, ELISA). Repeat cell count and differential CIE: countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis;ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Radiological studies Chest X-ray The chest X-ray is the gold standard for the iden- tification of pneumonia but may lag symptomsby several days. Two views of the chest are helpfulto improve identification of retrocardiac processes.Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) may belobar or a diffuse interstitial process (\"walkingpneumonia\"). Focal infiltrates represent consoli-dation and fluid accumulation within air spaces,resulting in the loss of air-solid interfaces on radiograph. Plain radiographs may not be help-ful in distinguishing infection from other causesof consolidation such as atelectasis (air sac col-lapse). Effusions, particularly unilateral, mayrepresent complications (empyema) or Endobronchial processessuch reactive airway disease or bronchitis rarelydemonstrate clinically important radiographicfindings. Pregnancy testing and proper shieldingwith lead can reduce inadvertent exposure. Other plain radiographs Soft tissue neck X-rays may help in the diagnosis of epiglottitis. The classic thumbprint replacesthe normally thin epiglottic shadow. Prevertebralsoft space width may be increased due toretropharyngeal abscess. Air in the soft tissues may represent a gas-forming organism. Films ofsuspected extremities are usually unnecessaryunless there is suspicion of foreign body, necro-tizing fasciitis, or a long-standing deep infection.Osteomyelitis is the slow destruction of bonyarchitecture that may be apparent after morethan 1 week of symptoms. Ultrasound Ultrasound (US) can accurately and rapidly iden- tify fluid-filled structures such as deep tissue abscesses (perinephric, subhepatic, tubo-ovarian)without risk of radiation exposure. US is also themodality of choice in identifying biliary tract dis-ease. Gallbladder wall thickening greater than3mm, pericholecystic fluid, or ductal dilatation in a patient with pain, tenderness, and fever shouldprompt an immediate surgical consultation. Theincreased availability of bedside US to physicians,and their increasing comfort with this techniquehas resulted in greater use, such as in joint aspir-ation and abscess drainage.Computed tomography regarding deepinfections, especially in those areas inaccessibleby US or obscured by bone or air-filled struc-tures, such as the brain, paranasal sinuses, ordeep abdomen. Attenuation differences amongtissues are enhanced by the administration of contrast material. Appropriate contrastingmethods (PO, IV , rectal) and delays of 2-4 hoursare necessary for maximal accuracy (especially inthin patients). All patients must be evaluated forany contraindications to contrast such as priorallergy, pregnancy, or renal insufficiency. Patientsshould be adequately hydrated, and metforminuse should be discontinued briefly. Other radiological tests Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is rarely nec- essary for the initial work-up of fever. Spinal cordimpingement from a suspected epidural abscessmay be one exception. Radionucleotide-taggedbone scintillography may be useful in isolating arecurring fever of unknown etiology. General treatment principles The duration of patient interview must be tailored to the severity of illness, which in turn is mostoften related to the host's ability to fight diseaserather than the particular pathogen. Febrile adultspresenting with abnormal vital signs, alteredsensorium, airway compromise, respiratory orcirculatory distress require rapid simultaneousdiagnostic testing and resuscitative therapy.Recognition of the severity of illness and transferto a resuscitation area in the ED with the appro-priate personnel is essential. The standard man-agement priorities of the ABCs take precedenceover treatment of the fever itself. Immediateinterventions include assuring airway patency,providing supplemental oxygen or supportinginadequate ventilatory efforts, and obtainingadequate vascular access for fluid resuscitation. Further history gathering may be limited by the severity of illness, resulting in the need foralternative sources of pertinent history. Theseinclude reports from emergency medical services,accompanying family members, transfer or med-ical records, or the primary care physician.Families of elderly patients often understand that Primary Complaints 347Fever in adultsinfection is a frequent cause of death. Care must be taken that any advance directive, if available,be adhered to prior to initiating invasive diag-nostic and stabilizing measures. Antipyretics The administration of antipyretics for fever hasbecome standard practice to provide patientcomfort. It is important to inquire about the timeand dose of the most recently administeredantipyretic. Acetaminophen is the most commonanti-fever drug used in the ED, and can be usedconcurrently with an NSAID such as ibuprofen.Large studies have demonstrated similar effica-cies between acetaminophen and ibuprofen in thetreatment of fever, although NSAIDs may resultin greater gastrointestinal irritation and reduc-tion in renal blood flow, which may limit their usein some patients. Although extremely dangerousin the overdose setting, acetaminophen has awide margin of safety in doses up to the currentrecommendations of 1 g every 4 hours (maximum 4g/day). Hepatic metabolism may limit its use in liver failure. Ibuprofen is inexpensive and may begiven in any combination of 2400 mg/24 hours(e.g., 400 mg every 4 hours or 800 mg every 8hours). Aspirin for febrile illness should beavoided secondary to its association with Reye'ssyndrome in children. Selective COX-2 inhibitorshave no role in the treatment of fever in the ED. Intravenous fluids Alow threshold should exist for initiating IV fluid therapy in patients with fever who appearill or dehydrated. Peripheral vasodilation resultsin a relative decrease in central circulating volume.Fluid losses from vomiting and diarrhea areexacerbated by increased insensible losses fromthe skin and respiratory system. IV fluids pro-vide a modest cooling effect, replace volume andthus reduce tachycardia and thirst, improvingthe overall degree of comfort. Cooling measures Patients presenting with temperatures confirmedto be greater than 105\u00b0F (40.5\u00b0C) are more likelyexperiencing hyperpyrexia. In addition to stand-ard resuscitative efforts, attempts should also be made to immediately lower body temperature.Excessive fluids should be avoided unless thereis a clear history of fluid losses or in the setting ofoliguric renal failure. Rapid cooling can beachieved through the use of cool sponge bathsaugmented by moist evaporative cooling fromfans. Ice packs to the groin and axillae are effective.The use of alcohol applied to the skin as a coolingagent is discouraged. Invasive techniques of coolcavity lavage are last resorts, and are associatedwith serious morbidity. Antimicrobial therapy The initiation of antimicrobial therapy should bedone only after careful consideration and rapidcollection of appropriate laboratory specimens.Delaying antibiotic therapy in order to obtainspecimens for suspected sepsis or meningitis(e.g., CSF) is not appropriate. Studies indicatethat administration of the first-dose of antibi-otics while in the ED improves outcome anddecreases hospital length of stay in serious bacter-ialillnesses. When the likelihood of an infectious cause of fever is sufficiently great, or when the host is vul-nerable to systemic illness, empiric antibioticsmay be given prior to the identification of a spe-cific source or organism. In cases of potentiallylife-threatening infections, broad-spectrum antibi-otic combinations that cover Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and anaerobic organisms shouldbe given until a specific organism is identified onculture. In cases of localized infections, the spec-trum of coverage should then be narrowed tocover the organism(s) most likely responsible forinfection (e.g., Gram-positive organisms for anacute uncomplicated cellulitis) and to reduceantibiotic resistance. The exact antibiotic choice for infections is beyond the scope of this chapter. Most cliniciansconsult specialized handbooks or computer pro-grams, which are frequently updated. Generalprinciples to consider when selecting an antibi-otic are to first confirm any drug allergies withthe patient and from past medical records, ifavailable. Patients typically do not distinguishadverse reactions such as nausea from true aller-gic reactions. The likely pathogens at the infectedsite should then be considered. Decide whethercoverage needs to be broadened based upon hostdefense deficiencies or special exposures. Con-sider the local pathogen resistance patterns, oftenposted on the hospital laboratory web site.Drug-drug interactions need to be considered(e.g., warfarin and ciprofloxacin). The route ofadministration depends upon the drug selected.Of note, more expensive IV medications do notnecessarily offer special benefit over highly Fever in adults 348 Primary Complaintsbioavailable oral preparations, except in the most severely ill patients or those patients with poorgut function (from passive congestion or hypo-perfusion). Dosage may need adjustment in eld-erly patients and those with liver and kidneydysfunction. All patients should be warned aboutmedication side effects and potential complica-tions of therapy, such as candidiasis or colitis.Many antibiotics render oral contraceptives lesseffective. Patients should be informed to completethe recommended course of antibiotics regardlessof symptom improvement, and to discard anytablets that may remain. Special patients Pediatrics Refer to Chapter 23. Elderly Geriatric patients and elderly patients residing atskilled nursing facilities represent groups withan increased risk of serious infection. Greaterexposures to pathogens that have antibiotic-resistance and decreased immunological respon- siveness make them more vulnerable to adverseoutcome. Of note, up to one-third of elderlypatients do not mount a fever with systemic infec-tions. Often the reason for transfer from a skilled facility is nonspecific, such as unexplained fallsor persistent tachycardia. The presence of delir-ium superimposed on preexisting cognitivedefects reduces the ability to rely on history.Greater reliance is therefore placed on a thor-ough physical examination and screening labora-tories. The most common sources of serious infections include urinary (50-60%), respiratorytract, and soft tissue. Noninfectious sources arealso more common in elderly patients. Consideradmission for any febrile elderly patient with theexception of those not desiring aggressive orinpatient management. Confinement and fre-quent hospitalizations increase the likelihood ofantibiotic-resistant organisms. Immune compromised Conditions that diminish a host's ability to fightinfection frequently encountered in the ED settinginclude socially-disadvantaged and substance-dependent patients. Crowded living conditionsin shelters predispose patients to communicablediseases through contact (scabies) or dropletinfection (tuberculosis). Poor nutrition and expos-ureto hostile weather conditions compound these risks. Alcoholics are especially vulnerableto pneumonia due to increased incidence ofvomiting and aspiration. The presence of ascitesfrom alcoholic liver disease should key the clin-ician to consider spontaneous bacterial peritonitisas a cause of fever. IV drug users are at risk forlocal skin abscesses, cellulitis, endocarditis, andblood-borne viruses such as HIV and hepatitis.Diabetics are at risk for chronic fungal and footinfections secondary to impaired microcircula-tion and diminished wound healing. Sickle celland splenectomized patients are at particularrisk for infection by encapsulated organisms suchas Pneumococcus . Sickle cell patients presenting in crisis should have infectious precipitants ruled out. HIV-related infections HIV-related infections are correlated with theCD4 count. Primary HIV infection manifests as aflu-like illness following a 2-4 week incubationperiod. Opportunistic infections or AIDS-definingillnesses do not present until the CD4 count hasfallen below 400 cells/mm 3and viral loads begin to rise. Once CD4 counts fall below 100 cells/mm3, a variety of otherwise as Kaposi's sarcomaand lymphoma is also high in this patient popu-lation. An acute HIV infection should be con-sidered in a patient with acute febrile illness and adenopathy, pharyngitis, or risk factors. Fevers may occur from antibiotics used in prophylaxis or tr eatment, such as sulfonamides or dapsone. Antiretroviral is associated withdrug fever, myositis, pancreatitis, and hepatitis.The work-up for patients with advanced HIVshould include blood, urine, and possibly sputumand stool tests. A chest X-ray is indicated in essen-tially all HIV-positive individuals with cough andfever. An LDH level is often elevated in patientswith PCP , despite the chest X-ray being normal inup to 40% of patients. CT of the brain prior to LP inpatients with AIDS is a prudent precaution, asmass lesions such as toxoplasmosis may be present. Organ transplant Likely causes of fever in organ transplant patientscorrelate with the time since transplantation. Primary Complaints 349Fever in adultsFevers within 1 month are likely to be related to surgical wounds and occasionally to transmitteddonor infections. Few fevers are secondary toopportunistic infections this early. In the 1-6 monthpost-transplant period, there is an increased inci-dence of viral infections, such as Epstein-Barrvirus (EBV), CMV , hepatitis B and C, HIV , andother opportunistic infections. The increasedincidence of rejection and fever caused by anti-lymphocytic antibody treatment is also increased.It is not until months or years after transplantationthat the causes of fever largely mimic those in thepopulation at large. Organ recipients remain at a somewhat increased risk of malignancy andopportunistic infection due to their immune-modulating therapy. Antibiotic therapy is com-plex and should involve consultation with thetransplant team. Returned foreign traveler The returned traveler represents a particular chal-lenge in the ED. In addition to the typical infectionsprevalent in the US, additional infectious possibili-ties not typically seen in the US must be con-sidered. It is important to identify all foreigndestinations and special exposures, such as travelto farms or jungles. Many travelers routinely querytheir doctors for immunization recommendationsand antibiotic prophylaxis prior to foreign travel. The most common travel affliction is traveler's diarrhea. Other significant diseases to considerthat may present as fever include cholera, dengueand yellow fever, malaria, schistosomiasis, andtrypanosomiasis. The Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC-P) maintains a compre-hensive updated travel resource for tourists andphysicians (http:/ /www.cdc.gov/travel). Patientsmay require quarantine until the diagnosis can be made, although this is rare. Neutropenia Patients undergoing chemo- or radiation therapyoften present to the ED with fever. Dramatic dropsin neutrophil counts occur 1-2 weeks followingcytotoxic therapy. Despite the near obliterationof cells that produce endogenous pyrogens(agranulocytosis), the ability to mount a fever isremarkably preserved. Neutropenia is defined as a blood neutrophil count of less than 500 cells/mm 3. The incidence of bacteremia climbs sharply as neutrophil counts fall below 100 cells/mm3. Febrile patients who are likely neutropenicshould have blood samples for CBC and culturequickly drawn prior to the administration ofbroad-spectrum antibiotics such as ceftazidimeor imipenem. Vancomycin may be added forpatients in whom indwelling catheters are thesuspected source of infection. Only the mostwell-appearing, reliable, compliant neutropenicpatients should be considered for discharge, andonly after discussion with that patient's primarycare physician or hematologist/oncologist. Institutionalized Patients who have been exposed to nosocomialpathogens are at great risk for colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Although no more virulent than their sus-ceptible counterparts, infections with theseorganisms are difficult to eradicate and can pro-duce symptomatic infection. Newer strains offluoroquinolone-resistant enteric bacteria andvancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus pose serious future public health risk. It is important thathealth care providers exercise strict contact pre-cautions. Limiting the inappropriate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is likely to slow the spread of drug resistance. Spinal cord injury The incidence of fever in spinal cord-injuredpatients is quite high. Decreased mobility and lossof reflexes distal to the lesion predisposes indi-viduals to UTIs, pneumonia, and infected softtissue decubiti. Nearly all patients who do notvoid spontaneously become colonized with bac-teria from prolonged urine dwell times and self-catheterization. Loss of function above T6 disruptsthermoregulatory neural circuits, impairingshivering sweating responses. Patients maysuffer autonomic hyperreflexia with inter-mittent excessive sweating contributing to thermalinstability. Despite being insensate in infectedareas, spinal cord-injured patients often appreciatespreading infection as vague malaise. Post-surgical/postpartum Patients who have recently undergone surgicalprocedures or childbirth are at risk for the devel-opment of fever. The classic 5 W's mnemonic(wind, water, wound, womb, and wonder drug)remains a helpful reminder for the most common sources of fever. The earliest and most commoncause of post-operative fever is atelectasis, often Fever in adults 350 Primary ComplaintsPrimary Complaints 351Fever in adultsoccurring within 1-2 days. Bacterial counts at seeded sites may rise to levels that cause symp-toms by post-operative day 3. Cesarean sectionincreases the risk of endometritis compared withvaginal delivery. It is important to look closely atall surgical wounds, including episiotomies, forsigns of infection. Disposition Fever itself is not considered a reason for hospitaladmission. Healthy patients with acute viral ill-nesses who quickly respond to antipyretics,antiemetics, IV hydration, and other medicationadjuncts do not require hospitalization. Healthypatients with localized bacterial infections whocan tolerate oral therapy can also be safely dis-charged. Appropriate discharge instructionsmust be provided and follow-up with outpatientclinicians should be arranged in case localizedcomplications develop or general deterioration limits a patient's ability to care for him- or herself.Specific criteria explaining r easons to return to the ED are vital. Patients with significant cardiopul- monary comorbidity, the elderly, alcoholics, thehomeless, and those with compromised immunesystems (including diabetes) may require admis-sion for infectious processes that could be man-aged as an outpatient in healthy people. The following indications for admission may serve as a helpful guide; however, each casedepends upon patient preference, social support,and outpatient provider support. Admissionshould be considered for any patient with: 1.a non-viral systemic infection; 2.serious deep local or regional infections requiring IV antibiotics; 3.infections that require surgical interventionbeyond simple incision and drainage; 4.any infection resulting in alterations ofbehavior or consciousness. Individuals with limited physiologic reserve andthose incapacitated by fever are likely to requireadmission, even if the source is unknown. It is the responsibility of the emergency provider to ensure that time-specific return crite-ria are clear and understood. Most infectionstreated with antibiotics should symptomaticallyimprove within 72 hours. Those who are not ableto follow through on a reasonable outpatient planby default should be considered for admission. It is important to be aware of national guidelines now common in the treatment of many seriousinfections. Severity rating scales, treatment sug-gestions, and admission criteria are often providedbased on clinical research, consensus guidelines,or both. Infectious disease consultation is rarelynecessary acutely, but may provide an option for adifficult case or a challenging disposition. Manyhospital pharmacies now have policies in placethat limit the use of certain antibiotics. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Fever is a nonspecific symptom with a broaddifferential including both benign andserious illness. The diagnostic work-up andtreatment depend upon host factors andspecific causes. General resuscitative principles takeprecedent over the treatment of fever or theidentification of specific causative agents. Fever must be quickly distinguished from hyperpyrexia. Improper treatment forone may lead to serious morbidity andmortality. Universal precautions are protective for the provider and patient. Care must be taken to leave all potentially infectivematerials safely disposed in the room withthe patient. Most often the cause of a fever can be made from the history and physicalexamination alone. Special historical questions regardingpersonal, sexual, occupational, travel, pets,and dietary habits must be asked. Infrared tympanic thermometers areinadequate screening tools for fever. Alow threshold should exist to recheck the temperature in the appropriate setting by other means and repeatedly, ifnecessary. The diagnostic framework for determiningcauses of a systemic physiologicalabnormality such as fever is best done byorgan system rather than by anatomic region. Expedient laboratory sample collectionshould occur prior to antibiotic treatment.Antibiotic treatment should not be delayed ifsample collection proves difficult. Antibiotics are less effective at preventinginfection than treating them. Given ourcurrent drug-resistance crisis, every effortshould be made to limit antibiotic use tothose patients with documented or seriousbacterial illness.Fever in adults 352 Primary ComplaintsReferences 1.Balentine J. emergencies.

The objective of ED evaluation of febrile children is to identify and treat the small subset of children who harbor life-threatening bacterialinfections. A febrile infant is at risk for bacterial infections (SBIs), includingbacteremia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, suppura- tive skin infection, urinary tract infection, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia.Concurrently, an attempt is made to avoid theindiscriminate use of antibiotics in febrile children.The etiology of a child's fever in the majority ofcases is an acute viral infection. Unfortunately,considerable overlap exists in the clinical appear-ance of a child with occult bacteremia (presence of pathogenic bacteria in the blood of a well- appearing febrile child without an identifiable focus of infection) and a child with fever due to a viral illness. As a result, the broad spectrum ofadvocated management practices for febrile chil-dren continues to be the subject of much researchand controversy. Pathophysiology Fever results from body temperature elevationabove normal circadian variation due to anincrease in the hypothalamic thermoregulatoryset point. A febrile response is thought to resultfrom enhanced metabolic activity and is mediatedby the release of pyrogens. These pyrogens (e.g.,tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and inter-feron) are released from host leukocytes, which inturn reset the temperature regulatory center in thehypothalamus. In neonates, fever response path-ways are not well-developed; consequently, feveris not a uniformly sensitive marker for acute infec-tions. As a r esult, hypothermic or normothermic children with altered behavior (e.g., poor feedingand weak cry), especially neonates, warrant care-ful evaluation for acute infections. Achild's immune system matures with age. Aneonate relies primarily on passive transfer ofprotective maternal immunoglobulins (IgG) toward off infections. A child's immune systembecomes more adept at responding to bacterial andviral pathogens over time. Widespread immun-ization of children has significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality caused by varicella,Haemophilus influenza type B, and the poliovirus infections, to name a few. Young infants are unableto mount sustained immunologic responses to cer-tain vaccines (e.g., pertussis vaccine). This delay in immune response renders young infants sus-ceptible to these illnesses. Elevated body temperatures are often caused by infections, but also result from excessive phys-iologic stress (e.g., hyperthyroid state), centralnervous system (CNS) lesions, inflammation,malignancy, or exposure to chemicals (e.g., drugs).Fever should be distinguished from hyperthermia.Hyperthermia is defined as an elevation in body temperature that is not associated with an eleva-tion of the thermoregulatory set point. Hyper-thermia is found in conditions characterized byinadequate heat dissipation from the body (e.g.,environmental exposure, neuroleptic malignantsyndrome, anticholinergic or sympathomimetictoxidromes). History How high and how wasit recorded? Atemperature of /H1109138.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) is generally considered the threshold for defining a fever. A rectal temperature is regarded as the most accur- ate method of detecting core body temperature.Apositive correlation between absolute height of fever and the risk for bacteremia has been estab-lished. While an elevated temperature itself isnot believed harmful, it does impose metabolicdemands on the body and predisposes certainchildren to complications. A small subset of chil-dren between the ages of 6 months and 5 yearswill be predisposed to developing febrile seizuresas their body temperature rises. Children withepilepsy are at increased risk for seizures as aresult of febrile illnesses.23 Fever in children Lynne McCullough, MDand Eric Savitsky, MDFever in children 354 Primary ComplaintsHow ill do the parents perceive their child to be? The primary factor dictating the extent of a febrilechild's ED evaluation is the overall appearance inan otherwise healthy child. A severely ill-appearingchild should undergo an extensive fever evalu-ation and receive empiric antibiotic therapy. Ahappy, playful child in no visible distress is anideal candidate for a less aggressive evaluation.Carefully listening to a calm and experienced par-ent's assessment of how ill their child appears is important. Parents are often more attune to illnesssubtleties in their children than are healthcareworkers practicing in a hurried ED environment.Difficulties with feeding or anorexia are import-ant clinical indicators of SBI and warrant carefulevaluation. Administration of antipyretics to children pre- senting to the ED with a fever often results in arapid improvement in their appearance andbehavior. Febrile children tend to be more irritableand ill-appearing, often leading to more extensiveED evaluations. Visual and behavioral clues to ill-ness severity are difficult to ascertain in youngerpatients. Studies utilizing experienced clinicianshave demonstrated that with infants below 2months of age, clinical appearance alone is aninsensitive indicator of illness severity. This factunderlies the more conservative approach to theevaluation of fever advocated in younger patients(e.g., neonates). How long has the child been sick or had a fever? In order to correctly establish a febrile child's course of illness, careful attention must be paidto the chronology of symptoms. For example, achild with a febrile illness for several days whoappears to be improving is less likely to harboran SBI than a listless and ill-appearing child whois only several hours into their febrile illness. What are the child's associated symptoms? Questions regarding the presence of associated symptoms can help identify the source of a child'sfever. For example, a preceding history of dysuriaand increased frequency of urination in a childare important clues suggesting the diagnosis of pyelonephritis. Infant teething should not beconsidered as a source of fever. Other symptomconstellations may suggest a viral etiology forthe fever, such as rhinorrhea, sneezing and coughfor viral upper respiratory infection, and vomitingaccompanied by diarrhea for acute viral gas-troenteritis. The child's hydration status should be deter- mined by an evaluation inquiring about urineoutput and oral intake. The current number ofwet diapers and the amount of oral fluids shouldbe considered relative to when the child was pre-viously well. Was there exposure to ill contacts? Sick household contacts and day-care classmates can be important reservoirs of disease. Inquiriesinto the specific type of infections (e.g., tubercu-losis) that family members are suffering fromoften provide valuable clues to the etiology offebrile illnesses. What is the child's medical history? Prior illnesses or co-morbid conditions often place children at higher risk for suffering com-plications from SBI. For example, a child withcyanotic congenital heart disease will be less tol-erant of an acute pulmonary infection comparedto an otherwise healthy patient with a similar ill-ness. Risk factors for SBI in neonates includeissues related to birth history, including maternalfever, prolonged rupture of membranes, prema-ture birth, and low birth weight. Prior pneumoniaor urinary tract infection would also suggest thepossibility of recurrence as the source of fever. Co-morbid conditions (e.g., congenital heart disease) or immunodeficient states (e.g., organ transplantrecipients, cancer patients receiving chemother- apy, sickle cell patients with functional asplenia)are risk factors for SBI at any age. Inquiring abouta child's immunization status is very important, as a child with an incomplete immunization recordis at risk for a wider variety of illnesses and maybenefit from more conservative care. Has there been any travel history? Has there been any exposure to animals? Travel outside the US may expose children to a variety of infectious diseases (e.g., malaria, typhoid). Noting the geographic areas a patient has traveled or lived within the US may provide useful information (e.g., Rocky Mountain spottedfever association with the East Coast). Inquiringabout exposure to animals as well as tick and insectbites may provide important clues to the etiologyof infectious illnesses (e.g., cat-scratch disease).Primary Complaints 355Fever in childrenWhat medications has the child been given recently? It is important to determine the last time the child received antibiotics, what type was given and for what condition. In the case of recent and recurrentinfection, the antibiotic choice may need to bemodified to one that has a broader spectrum ofcoverage to help ensure susceptibility. If the childhas become progressively ill despite current antibi-otic therapy, the possibility of an incompletely treated meningitis must be entertained. The amount, type, frequency, and time of the last dose of antipyretic given prior to ED presen-tation also provides insight into the impact themedication is having on the fever. This informa-tion also provides an opportunity for parentaleducation in cases of inadequate dosing or pro-longed dosing intervals that may contribute to thepersistence of fever in their child. Physical examination General appearance Observation of a child's behavior while acquiringthe history of present illness is a care provider'sinitial clue to illness severity. Attempts to defineclinical features as indicators of SBI have beenmade (e.g., Yale Observation Scale, which includesan objective assessment of a child's alertness, play-fulness, interaction with the environment, color,state of hydration, quality of cry, and ability to beconsoled). Unfortunately, these clinical tools havebeen shown to be neither sensitive nor specific fordistinguishing young infants with SBI. An assess-ment of a patient's mental status, activity, tempera-ment, and interaction with their environment arethe initial steps in evaluating febrile children. The assessment of a child's responsiveness should include observation of the child's inter-action with the practitioner, their spontaneousvisual or physical exploration of the environment,reaching for and playing with age-appropriate toys, consolability with parents, and an observationof feeding behavior in small infants. Toxic childrenmay cry excessively, be irritable, or be lethargic anddifficult to arouse. They may demonstrate a lack ofinterest in the environment or in feeding, and canbe inconsolable by their parents. They may appearmottled or pale with tachypnea and grunting respi-rations, and may be listless with decreased toneand response to external stimuli. Vital signs Begin with a review of triage vital signs (Table23.1).

Pediatric Emergency Medicine: Concepts and Clinical Practice, 2nd ed., St. Louis: Mosby, 1997.Table 23.1 Vital signs in children by ageFever in children 356 Primary Complaintsin all children less 90 days of age, in those with tachypnea, and in all children too young to coop-erate adequately with an oral temperature. Theheight of the fever should be noted, as it hasprognostic value. Higher fevers are associatedwith an increased incidence of SBI, although themajority of these patients have viral infections.Elevated heart and respiratory rates may be thedirect result of a fever. Tachycardia out of pro-portion to the degree of fever occurs with dehy-dration, sepsis, and cardiac conditions. Persistenttachycardia or tachypnea despite defervescencemay be an indication of SBI. Blood pressure is aninsensitive indicator of illness severity in children.Children have resilient cardiovascular compen-satory capacity and often maintain normal bloodpressures until advanced stages of illness. Pulseoximetry values of less than 95% on room air sug-gest compromised respiratory function and war-rant further evaluation. Head The anterior fontanelle should be assessed forbulging that occurs in the presence of elevatedintracranial pressure. A bulging fontanelle in atoxic-appearing infant is suggestive of menin-gitis. The eyes are evaluated for conjunctivalinjection and discharge, the nasopharynx andoropharynx for erythema, exanthems, or exud-ates. Injection of may be seenwith viral illness, conjunctivitis, or Kawasaki'sdisease (Figure 23.1). A careful evaluation of the oropharynx may yield important clues to theetiology of an infant's high fever and anorexia(e.g., mucosal of Coxsackievirus infection, a strawberry tongue disease (Figure 23.2), or latestage scarlet fever). Exudative tonsillitis in achild less than 2 years of age is most often viral inorigin. The definitive diagnosis of acute otitismedia is made difficult by cerumen, crying, orfever leading to hyperemia of the tympanicmembrane. Acute otitis media is typically associ-ated with a middle ear effusion and a hyperemictympanic membrane with altered landmarks.Decreased movement of the tympanic mem-brane with insufflation is widely cited as themost accurate method to assess for middle eareffusion. Neck The neck is examined for localized masses (i.e.,lymphadenopathy and abscesses) and for pas-sive range of motion. In the correct clinical con-text, nuchal rigidity (resistance to flexion andextension of the neck) suggests meningealinflammation (i.e., meningitis). This sign is oflimited value in young children and infants, asthey often fail to develop nuchal rigidity despitehaving meningitis. In older children, nuchalrigidity may be identified by eliciting pain orspasm with knee extension with the knee and hipflexed at 90\u00b0 (positive Kernig's sign), and hipflexion that occurs following passive neck flex-ion (positive Brudzinski's sign), although thesesigns are not reliable.

Copyright 2002, with permission fromElsevier.Primary Complaints 357Fever in childrenLungs Pulmonary examination begins with the assess- ment of work of breathing (i.e., respiratory rate,presence of retractions, or accessory muscle use).Tachypnea is a valuable clue to serious pulmonary infection. Auscultatory findings in pneumoniamay demonstrate egophony, crackles, or wheezes.Young children may harbor significant pulmonary infections yet present with minimal auscultatoryfindings. The finding of diffuse symmetric cracklesoften signifies acute bronchiolitis. A subset ofchildren with acute bronchiolitis (e.g., albuterol) with reso-lution of auscultatory crackles. Heart Cardiac evaluation involves assessing heart rate,heart sounds, murmurs, and listening for addi-tional findings (e.g., pericardial friction rub).Many children will have accentuation of inno-cent heart flow mur-mur and Grade III or higher murmur, diastolic mur-mur, or friction rub should be deemed pathologicwarranting further evaluation. Persistent tachy-cardias despite defervescence and rehydrationmay indicate SBI. Abdomen The examination of the abdomen is a critical stepin the evaluation of febrile children with con-current gastrointestinal complaints. Hypoactivebowel sounds are an indicator of diminished intes-tinal motility, and the absence of bowel sounds is acause for concern. Any focal tenderness, rebound,or guarding is suggestive of a potential surgicalabdomen (e.g., appendicitis). Hepatosplenomegalyis associated with a variety of diseases. Amajority of cases of acute appendicitis are misdiagnosed in infants and young children. Theaccurate diagnosis of appendicitis in young chil-dren is confounded because these patients havelimited communication skills, are difficult toexamine, and typically have benign gastrointest-inal illnesses (e.g., viral gastroenteritis) as the eti-ology of their fevers. Care providers should seriallyexamine the abdomen to ensure the examinationis benign in any febrile child with gastrointest-inal complaints. In addition, fever and protractedgastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., anorexia anddiarrhea) may be the presentation of a perforatedappendix with abscess formation.Extremities The extremities should be examined for color,capillary refill, and pulse strength. Cool extremitieswith poor capillary refill weak pulses are sug-gestive of diminished peripheral perfusion andsepsis syndrome or shock. All joints should be examined for the presence of erythema, edema, warmth, or tenderness.Septic arthritis is a noted source of infection ininfants. Skin The entire body of a febrile child should beinspected for the presence of a rash. The der-matologic manifestations of infectious diseases (a) (b) Figure 23.3 Meningococcemia. (a) This youngster manifests thepurpuric and petechial rash characteristic of acutemeningococcemia; (b) purpura may progress to formareas of frank cutaneous necrosis, especially in patientswith DIC. Reprinted from Atlas of Pediatric PhysicalDiagnosis, 4th ed., Eds Zitelli BJ, Davis HW. Copyright2002, familiarity with cific exanthems can provide helpful clues in eval-uating febrile patients. The most notableexample would be the classic cutaneous manifes-tations of Neisseria meningitides infections (Figure 23.3), including the presence of petechiae andpurpura. It is important to distinguish diffusepetechiae from those lesions which occur abovethe nipple line associated with vigorous cough-ing or crying, as well as those on the upperextremities following tourniquet placement.Other classic descriptions of rashes include\"dewdrop on a rose petal\" for the lesions of vari-cella, and the \"slapped-cheek\" rash of erythemainfectiosum (Figure 23.4). Lymphatic system Benign lymph nodes commonly palpated inhealthy children are typically 1 cm in size or less,painless, mobile, and devoid of any warmth orinduration. Any enlarged, warm, indurated, orfixed nodes warrant further evaluation. Rectogenital The circumcision status of a male patient with afever should be noted, as the presence of foreskincorrelates with an increased risk for urinary tractinfections. The scrotum and testes should beexamined to exclude epididymo-orchitis or testicu-lartorsion as a source of fever. The rectal region should be evaluated to exclude signs of infection(e.g., perirectal abscess). A common finding ininfants will be diaper dermatitis. This is differen-tiated from more serious exanthems by a lack ofassociated systemic findings, minimal tender-ness, and characteristic distribution. Neurologic An age-appropriate neurologic examination mayprovide other clues to the source of the fever. Aspreviously discussed, a diminished level of con-sciousness, lethargy, or irritability are worrisomefor SBI, as well as other serious conditions, suchas intussusception (Table 23.2). A reluctance toambulate or an antalgic gait in an older child with fever may suggest a septic arthritis orosteomyelitis as the source. Differential diagnosis Table 23.3 describes the symptoms, signs, and diagnostic tests associated with common diag-noses occuring in febrile children.

(continued )Diagnostic testing Diagnostic testing of febrile children varies greatly between care providers. There is no uni-formly accepted diagnostic approach to febrilechildren. Febrile child management algorithmsincorporate patient age, co-morbidities, generalappearance, vital signs, and results of ancillarytesting (e.g., white blood cell (WBC) count).Some clinicians rely on prior clinical experience,while others utilize study-based algorithms todictate their diagnostic evaluations. A list of laboratory studies may be ordered depending onthe clinical scenario. A brief summary of signifi-cant abnormalities is provided, as well as poten-tial pitfalls in the interpretation of each test.

Urinalysis Healthcare providers should generally obtain a catheterized specimen of urine until children areof school age, or are able to cooperate, todecrease the likelihood of a contaminated speci-men. An elevated specific gravity is indicative ofthe degree of dehydration of the patient. Thepresence of more than 5 WBCs/high-power field(hpf) as well as a positive nitrite test suggest abacterial infection. It is important to note that theurine may be normal in some children with uri-nary tract infections, particularly if obtained latein the day. If clinical suspicion is high, a urineculture should be sent, even if the urinalysis isnegative. A Gram's stain positive for the pres-ence of bacteria confirms the diagnosis of a uri-nary tract infection. Urine culture Results are typically not available for 24-48 hours; nonetheless, the urine culture is helpfulfor the identification of the infecting organismand its sensitivity to commonly prescribedantibiotics. Blood culture The delay in obtaining the results of cultures ren- ders them unhelpful in the ED management ofthe febrile child; nonetheless, blood cultures areinvaluable in the evaluation of the febrile childwithout a source. Cerebrospinal fluid Following lumbar puncture (LP), the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is routinely sent for glucose, protein,cell count including differential, Gram's stain,and culture. In the case of bacterial infection, adecreased glucose concentration compared withthe peripheral blood values and a protein ele-vated from normal values can be expected. Anelevated WBC count in an atraumatic LP needsto be evaluated for a leukocyte predominence,suggestive of a bacterial infection, as compared toa monocytic proliferation which is more indicativeof a viral infection of the meninges. Traumatic tapswith elevated RBC counts make the interpret-ation of the numbers and ratios of WBCs to RBCsmore problematic. A negative Gram's stain doesnot conclusively rule out the possibility of bacte-rial meningitis; if other clinical data suggest abacterial infection, the patient should be pre-sumed to have bacterial meningitis and treatedas such. A CSF culture requires 24-72 sedimentation C-reactive protein (CRP) level are two non-specific markers of inflammation in the bodywhich tend to be elevated in the presence of SBI.These are typically sent when the somewhat elu-sive diagnoses of osteomyelitis, septic arthritis,and Kawasaki's disease are being entertained. Stool studies The stool of a febrile child with a protracted course of diarrhea or bloody diarrhea can be sent for anumber of studies: the number of fecal leuko-cytes/hpf, bacterial culture, the presence of ovaand parasites, and the presence of Clostridium dif- ficile toxin in patients who have received an extended course of antibiotics preceeding theirdiarrhea. A WBC count more than 5/hpf in a stoolsmear suggests a bacterial etiology of the diarrhea.Bacterial culture results may later define theoffending agent. Radiologic studies Chest radiographs are indicated in any febrile childwho presents with signs of respiratory distress.These include the presence of tachypnea, dyspnea,hypoxia (pulse oximetry on room air below 95%),or abnormal breath sounds. Since young childrenmay harbor significant pulmonary infections withminimal auscultatory findings, a low threshold forradiographic imaging is indicated. Management algorithms Baraff et al. (1993) published the most widely pub-licized study regarding the management of febrilechildren. They performed a meta-analysis of stud-ies involving the evaluation of febrile children,and developed recommendations for the manage-ment of children 0-36 months of age with feverwithout a source. Fever that has been documentedat home by a reliable source should be consideredthe same as a febrile reading obtained at the doc-tor's office or in the ED. Fever without a source isFever in children 362 Primary Complaintsdefined as an acute febrile illness in which the eti- ology of the fever is not apparent after a carefulhistory and physical examination. A summary oftheir recommendations are listed below: Age below 28 days ACBC, catheterized urine specimen for UA, urine culture, blood culture and CSF for cell count, glucose, protein, Gram's stain and culture shouldbe obtained on all febrile patients below 28 daysof age. Age 28 days to 3 months Febrile infants in this age group may be divided into low- and high-risk for invasive bacterial dis-ease. The low-risk criteria include being previ-ously healthy, having no focal bacterial infectionon physical examination, and a negative laboratory screening. A negative laboratoryscreening examination includes a WBC countbetween 5000 and 15,000/mm 3, a neutrophil band count below 1500/mm3, UA with less than 10 WBCs/hpf and no bacteria on urine Gram'sstain, and CSF with less than 8 WBCs/hpf and nobacteria seen on Gram's stain. Infants meetingthese criteria had only a 1.4% chance of a SBI. Age 3 to 36 months The major concern in these patients is the presence of occult bacteremia. Although there is no singlelaboratory test that can immediately exclude thispossibility, the height of the WBC count is of somevalue as a screening test. Obtaining blood cul-tures is recommended if the WBC count is morethan 15,000/mm 3. For febrile patients without a source and a temperature of 39\u00b0C or higher, acatheterized urine specimen should be obtainedin all male infants up to 6 months of age if circum-cized, otherwise until 1 year of age, and in all female patients 24 months or less. A urine cultureshould also be sent. A stool culture should besent in the presence of diarrhea with gross blood.Children in this age category having feverof/H1102139\u00b0C without a source need no laboratory evaluation, but close outpatient follow-up iswarranted. Age above 36 months By 36 months of age, a child's immune system has developed such that the likelihood of SBI isless common. The incidence of occult bacteremiaincreases with higher temperatures and elevatedWBC counts. Laboratory studies in febrile children above 36 months of age are dictated bythe clinical setting. The widespread utilization of the Hemophilus influenzae type B (HIB) pneumococcal algorithms. Ourapproach to febrile children will undoubtedly bemodified as the microbiology of occult bacteremiachanges in the era of universal vaccination. General treatment principles Management of fever Early and appropriate antipyretic therapy should be instituted in all febrile children to facilitatebehavioral observation and relieve the child's dis- comfort associated with fever . Acet aminophen should be given at a dose of 15 mg/kg either per os (PO) or per rectum (PR) every 4-6 hours.Ibuprofen is also ef fective and can be given at 10mg/kg PO every 6-8 hours in combination with acetaminophen. Aspirin must not be used as an antipyretic in febrile children with viral syndromes (e.g.,influenza and varicella), as it has been associatedwith the development of Reye's syndrome. Empiric antibiotic therapy Immediate empiric antibiotic therapy and are indicated in any ill-appearing orsignificantly immunocompromised febrile child.Antibiotics are typically administered immedi-ately following diagnostic evaluation. If a delay inperforming diagnostic testing occurs, antibi- otics should not be withheld from ill-appearingpatients. Initial empiric antibiotic coverage shouldbe targeted at the most likely pathogens. Forexample, a child with clinical evidence of pneumo-niashould have antibiotic coverage against typ- In many febrile children, ED evaluation does not reveal a definitive source of infection. These patients are still at risk for occult bacteremia. Initial empiricantibiotic coverage against bacteremia in osporin triaxone or cefotaxime). bacteremia is StreptococcusPrimary Complaints 363Fever in monocytogenes is rec- ommended in febrile children in the first month of life. This regimen will not provide adequate anaer- obic or ganism coverage, nor will it provide adequate anti-pseudomonal coverage. Additionalantibiotic coverage needs to be administered if theaforementioned organisms are likely pathogens. Additional empiric antibiotic coverage may be indicated (e.g., vancomycin) against cephalosporin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae in any patient with a life-threatening infection. Finally,any neonate with evidence of a neonatal herpesvirus infection should be hospitalized and receiveempiric intravenous acyclovir therapy immediately. All febrile infants below 28 days of age, irre- spective of appearance, should have a completesepsis evaluation and be hospitalized followingthe administration of parenteral antibiotic ther-apy. Infants between the ages of 28 days and 3 months meeting low-risk criteria* may betreated with a parenteral dose of ceftriaxone(50 mg/kg), sent home and re-evaluated in 24 hours if logistically feasible. All high-risk infants in this age group warrant empiric antibiotic ther- apy and careful consideration for hospitalization. Special patients Immune compromised The management of immunodeficient pediatricpatients with fever varies greatly depending onthe specific immunodeficiency. In general, a lowerthreshold for diagnostic testing, empiric antibiotictherapy, and inpatient care is important in thispatient population. Febrile immune compromisedpatients (e.g., chemotherapy patients and post-organ transplant) often require initial broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage (e.g., imipenem)while awaiting results of diagnostic testing. Communication with the patient's subspecialtyphysicians is a crucial part of their ED care. Thesephysicians are excellent sources of additional clin-ical information that will optimize patient man-agement. In the event these high-risk patients aresent home, careful chart documentation and pro-vision of detailed aftercare instructions are crucial.Patients with indwelling devices Indwelling devices (e.g., central venous lines) arecommon sources of infection. A careful inspec-tion of the device's entry site into the skin may r eveal signs of infection (i.e., erythema, fluc- tuance, ind uration, or tenderness). Patients with indwelling devices represent a management chal-lenge. They are at substantially higher risk of seed-ing their prosthetic devices or having them serveas a source of infection. A low threshold forobtaining blood cultures in these patients is war-ranted. Strong consideration for empiric antibi-otic therapy and hospitalization should be givento febrile children with indwelling devices withno definitive source of infection. Disposition All toxic-appearing febrile children should be hos-pitalized, irrespective of age. Serial monitoring ofvital signs and clinical appearance will influencethe selection of an appropriate level of inpatientcare (e.g., intensive care unit). As a general rule,any febrile child below 1 month of age (28 days oflife), regardless of clinical appearance, is still hos-pitalized and treated with empiric antibiotic ther-apy pending culture results from a completeseptic workup. The decision whether to hospitalize patients older than 1 month with a fever is based on avariety of factors. These include presence orabsence of systemic symptoms (e.g., respiratorysymptoms), co-morbidities, course of illness,access to healthcare, and parental reliability. If adecision is made to discharge such a patienthome, a thorough discussion and documentationof aftercare instructions and return precautionsare paramount. It is also essential to ensure thatthe patient has follow-up to assess whether ornot the child is improving. Children who remainfebrile, or become less interactive with their envir-onment should be reassessed immediately. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Failing to realize that neonates with SBI mayhave subtle and nonspecific presentations(e.g., poor feeding). The most accurate method for assessing corebody temperature in the ED is with a rectalthermometer. Always inquire about antipyreticadministration prior to ED evaluation. *Low-risk criteria include being previously healthy, having no focal bacterial infection on physical examination, and aWBC count between 5000 and 15,000/mm 3, a neutrophil band count below 1500/mm3, UA with less than 10 WBCs/ hpf and no bacteria on urine Gram's stain, and CSF withless than 8 WBCs/hpf and no bacteria on Gram's stain.Fever in children 364 Primary ComplaintsAntipyretics may temporarily mask a fever and result in omitting an otherwiseindicated diagnostic evaluation for a febrilechild. Do not attribute an infant's fever to teething. Normal auscultation of the chest does notexclude the presence of a pneumonia inyoung febrile children. The urinary tract is a common site ofbacterial infection in young infants. Failure toobtain a catheterized urine sample will oftenlead to misleading laboratory results. Failing to administer antibiotic coverage (e.g.,vancomycin) against cephalosporin-resistantstrains of Streptococcal pneumoniae in patients with life-threatening infections andorganisms likely to be resistant. Failing to provide prompt parental antibiotictherapy (e.g., intramuscular route) in ill-appearing febrile children when there is a delay in obtaining intravenous access or completing diagnostic testing.

Severity of bleeding may rangefrom asymptomatic rectal bleeding to circulatorycollapse from massive blood loss. The serious-ness of the disorder may be difficult to assess ini-tially, presenting a diagnostic and therapeuticchallenge for emergency physicians. GI bleeding (GIB) may occur at any age, most commonly between 40 and 79 years of age. Mor-tality is highest after the age of 60 years. GIB isdivided into upper (UGIB) and lower (LGIB).UGIB occurs in 50-150/100,000 adults each year.There are 250,000 hospital admissions each yearfor UGIB, with costs of almost $1 billion. Anatomic essentials The ligament of Treitz crosses the small intestineat the junction of the duodenum and jejunum.Bleeding above the ligament of Treitz is consideredUGIB; below this ligament it is considered LGIB.Hematemesis is the vomiting of blood. Coffee-ground emesis is from GIB in which blood has been in the stomach long enough to have been partiallydigested by stomach acid. UGIB usually results inthe digestion of blood as it transits the small intes-tine. This results in melena (dark or black tarry stools), which is often foul-smelling. The passingofmaroon or dark red stools is called hema- tochezia . This is usually from LGIB; however, this can also occur from brisk UGIB with a fast intes-tinal transit time. Bright red blood per rectum(BRBPR) is often from distal bleeding (descendingcolon, rectosigmoid, or rectum) or fast transit time. The distal ileum may have a congenital mal- formation, known as Meckel's diverticulum , which may contain gastric tissue and thus result in alocal ulceration or GIB. History Where are you seeing blood? Patients can have blood either in their vomitus (hematemesis) or in their stool (hematochezia).Hematemesis occurs in 50% of UGIB. Blood perrectum may be bright red, may appear on toiletpaper, or may be mixed with stool. Hematocheziamost often signifies LGIB but may be due to briskUGIB with a rapid transit through the intestinaltract. Have you had vomit that looked brown or like coffee grounds? Patients may not recognize that these are symp- toms of UGIB. Have you had dark black, tarry, or sticky stool (melena)? Melena occurs in about 70% of patients with UGIB and a third of patients with LGIB. Melena mayresult from as little as 60 ml of UGIB. Be sensitive to patients who may have visual impairment, diffi-culty with colors, or are elderly and not able togive you information about their stool or vomitus. How much bleeding have you had? This is often hard to assess, but ask if the blood in vomitus was merely streaking or frank blood,including the presence of any clots, as this pointsto larger amounts. Regarding bleeding per rec-tum, patients may see only a small amount onthe toilet paper, or may be passing clots. It onlytakes a small amount of blood to change the colorof toilet bowl water (about 5 ml). If possible, tryto have the patient quantify their blood loss as ateaspoon or less, between a teaspoon and a cup,or more than a cup of blood. When did the bleeding start? Bleeding over days or weeks may appear mild, but can result in large blood loss and critically-illpatients. Heavy bleeding starting just prior to presentation sometimes resolves spontaneouslybut is more often an ominous sign. Is the bleeding painful or painless? Pain is from visceral or somatic nerves. If inflamed, the stomach and intestines can cause visceral pain.The oropharynx and anal verge have somatic painfibers; bleeding from these areas may result insomatic pain. In cases of UGIB, pain may repre-sent an ulcer or gastritis. In LGIB, pain may be24 Gastrointestinal bleeding J. Scott Taylor, MDGastrointestinal bleeding 366 Primary Complaintsassociated with inflammatory bowel disease or infectious diarrhea. Somatic pain may be from anal fissures or external hemorrhoids. Painless bleeding is usually from intestinal sources or internal hemorrhoids, without inflammation. Did you have vomiting or retching prior to hematemesis? This suggests a Mallory-Weiss tear of the esophagus. What other symptoms do you have? Are you dizzy or lightheaded? Patients with large blood loss may have symptoms of hypovolemia, orthostasis, or shock. Are you having chest pain or shortness of breath?Blood loss and shock may precipitate cardiacischemia or cause compensatory increasedrespiratory drive. Have you had a fever? This may be seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Have you ever had gastrointestinal bleeding before? Bleeding from a previous site recurs in 60% ofcases. What other medical problems do you have? Previous ulcers or gastritis can point to UGIB. Liver disease with portal hypertension can leadto esophageal varices. Coagulopathies and hemo-stasis problems (such as hemophilia and thrombo-cytopenia) can lead to significant bleeding anddifficulty in management. Known diverticula canalso cause bleeding. Patients with Helicobacter pylori infection of the gastric mucosa have a higher incidence of gastritis and risk of UGIB. What prior surgeries have you had? Any patient who has had an aortic aneurysm repair is at risk for an aortoenteric fistula. The graft erodes through the aorta into the intestinesand can lead to catastrophic blood loss. Have you ever had an endoscopic procedure? Documented ulcers, varices, or diverticula can give information about the current bleeding. Previousbanding or sclerosing of esophageal varices raisesthe risk of repeat bleeding due to portal hyper-tension or hepatic coagulopathy. What medications do you take? Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can increase the likelihood ofbleeding gastric ulcers. Iron ingestion by a childcan cause UGIB. Patients on warfarin or outpa-tient heparin injections can have significant GIB.Steroids increase the likelihood of UGIB. Bismuthand iron can result in black stool that simulatesmelena. Eating beets can simulate BRBPR. Do you drink alcohol? Alcohol use increases the likelihood of gastritis. It also can contribute to coagulopathy and liverdisease. Alcoholic cirrhosis can progress to portalhypertension with associated esophageal varicesand hemorrhoids. Physical examination The primary goal of the physical examination isto assess the severity of the patient's illness andthe amount of blood loss. The secondary goal is toestablish the location of GIB. Patients with GIBmay appear acutely ill with shock or may beasymptomatic except for their bleeding. The phys-ical examination is somewhat limited in utility for localizing bleeding, although the rectal examina-tion is very important. General appearance The appearance of cool, clammy, pale skin,decreased level of consciousness, and/or respira-tory distress is concerning, as it implies that thepatient is acutely ill, in shock, and in need ofimmediate resuscitation. Vital signs Signs of blood loss can be identified in the vitalsigns. A heart rate greater than 100 beats/minutecan be an indicator of blood loss. Abnormalorthostatic vital signs show a trend toward worseoutcomes in patients with GIB. Both the pulseand blood pressure are obtained with the patientsupine, sitting, and standing. The patient shouldrest 2 minutes in each position before the record- ings are made. Any patient who has symptoms ofdizziness or lightheadedness in the sitting posi-tion should not be allowed to stand. When thePrimary Complaints 367Gastrointestinal bleedingblood pressure drops more than 10 mmHg or the pulse increases more than 20 beats/minute fromlying to standing, this suggests volume loss.Orthostatic vital signs can be misleading though,especially in patients taking certain medications(e.g., beta-blockers). Some patients have greatreserve and will not drop their blood pressure until dangerously blood-depleted, especially chil-dren. Other patients can have postural changesunrelated to blood loss from GIB (e.g., elderly,diabetics with autonomic instability). Patients onantidysrhythmic medication or with pacemakersmay also be unable to respond to bleeding withpulse changes. An increase in the respiratory ratecan be an indication of blood loss, with increasedrespiratory drive to compensate for red blood cell loss, or as compensation for metabolic acidosissecondary to poor perfusion. Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat Observe for signs of liver disease such as ictericsclera. Conjunctivae can give a clue to anemia andblood loss if they are pale. Observe the oropharynxfor any signs of bleeding from the nose or throat.Posterior epistaxis and oral lacerations can resultin swallowed and falsepositive nasogastric (NG) evaluation. Post-oper-ative tonsillectomy bleeding can result in signifi-cant blood loss as the eschar falls off 5-7 daysafter the procedure. This can cause airway diffi-culty and requires ear, nose, and throat (ENT)evaluation, even if the bleeding has stopped. Abdomen Observe for distension. Auscultate for eitherincreased or decreased bowel sounds, althoughthis finding is nonspecific. Palpation may revealdiscomfort in the epigastric region. This can beassociated with an ulcer or gastritis. An enlargedor tender liver may be a clue to liver disease. Lookfor any evidence of peritonitis, as this may pointtoward an infectious cause. Palpation of an aorticaneurysm should raise the concern for an aor-toenteric fistula. Abdominal scars may point to aprevious aor tic bypass graft with its risk of aor- toenteric fistula, or pr evious surgeries for Crohn's disease. The abdomen may have prominent bluevessels around the umbilicus, known as caput medusa (or medusa's head). This dilation of abdominal wall veins occurs in portal hyperten-sion. Ascites suggests liver disease with possible coagulopathy or portal hypertension. Rectal The rectal examination is essential in evaluatingGIB. Inspection may show anal fissures or hemor-rhoids. Digital examination should evaluate for masses or tenderness. The stool is then checkedfor gross or occult blood. As little as 5 ml of bloodin the GI tract will give a positive hemoccult test.Anoscopy may be helpful if the GIB is believed to be from a lower GI source. This allows the anal verge to be visualized to identify a bleedinginternal hemorrhoid. Skin The skin should be examined for purpura or petechiae, suggesting an underlying coagu-lopathy. Observe for liver failuresuch as spider angiomata, palmar erythema andjaundice. Differential diagnosis Tables 24.1 and 24.2 describe the causes of upper and lower GI bleeding, respectively.

BRBPR: bright red blood per lower gastrointestinal bleeding ( cont) Diagnostic testing Occult blood The presence of hemoglobin (Hgb) in the stool is detected using a hemoccult card and specialized developer. Hemoccult testing may detect blood not seen by the naked eye. After developer hasbeen applied to the back of the filter paper (at thestool test site), the presence of a blue colorchange indicates the presence of Hgb and proba-ble blood. Tests can be positive up to 14 daysafter a single episode of bleeding. False positiveresults can occur from consumption of red meat, blood-containing food, iodide, cantaloupe,uncooked broccoli, turnip, radish, or horseradish3 days prior to the test. False negative results canoccur if the blood has not transited the intestinaltract, magnesium-containing antacids have beenused, ascorbic acid has been ingested, or the testis performed incorrectly. Laboratory studies Complete blood count An Hgb less than 10 g/dL suggests significant blood loss. Low Hgb may be chronic, and com-parison with previous values should be pursued.An Hgb less than 8 g/dL (hematocrit (Hct) lessthan 25 %) usually requires blood transfusion. Withfluid therapy, the red blood cell mass becomesdiluted and the Hgb decreases. Initial blood countsmay be normal if the bleeding has been very recent or is ongoing. Keep this in mind when using initialblood counts to determine therapy or disposition.Serial Hgb measurements are more useful forassessing the degree of blood loss. The white blood count (WBC) may be ele- vated in infectious diarrhea or inflammatorybowel pro cesses. Low platelet counts incr ease the likelihood of bleeding and should be corrected if less than 50,000/ml and bleeding is ongoing. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) greater than 36 mg/dL may suggest GIB in the appropriate clinical set-ting. It becomes elevated as the protein in bloodis digested and absorbed from the GI tract, rais-ing the serum urea level. Be cautious in the diag-nostic use of BUN, as it can also be elevated whenpatients are dehydrated or in the case of renal fail-ure. If the BUN/creatinine ratio is greater than 20,this suggests dehydration, or a \"pre-renal\" causeof an increased BUN to creatinine ratio. Type and crossmatch Whenever the patient's condition allows, it is preferable to provide type-specific blood fortransfusion. If the patient is stable, a type andGastrointestinal bleeding 370 Primary Complaintsscreen may be sent, followed by cross-match should the patient deteriorate. Prothrombin time Patients with liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, or taking warfarin may have a coagulopathy thatrequires correction to stop the bleeding. Electrocardiogram Cardiac ischemia may be precipitated by GIB.Any patient over 50 years of age, with a history ofheart disease, significant anemia, hypotension,chest pain, shortness of breath, or other evidenceof shock should have an electrocardiogram(ECG). The ECG may reveal evidence of ischemiaor infarction in the setting of GIB. If ECG changesare seen, early emergent transfusion should bepursued. Nasogastric tube Anasogastric (NG) tube should be placed in all patients with UGIB. It is important for determin-ing the location and degree of bleeding. The needfor a NG tube is controversial in cases of LGIB.Some apparent LGIB is actually brisk UGIB and isonly detected by NG evaluation. If there is anydoubt, an NG tube should be placed. An NG tube may show active bleeding or coffee-ground material. In 10-15% of UGIBpatients, bright red blood or clots are found.Gentle gastric lavage with saline or sterile water is then done to see if bleeding has stopped; lavageis performed until the blood clears. If bleedingcontinues, the tube is left in place. If no blood orcoffee grounds are found in the NG effluent, thetube can usually be removed. NG suction has afalse negative rate of 10%. This can occur withintermittent bleeding, or if the bleeding is duo-denal and spasm of the pylorus prevents thereflux of blood into the stomach. If bile is present and no blood is seen, this excludes the possibilityof active bleeding above the ligament of Treitz.False positives occur in the case of traumatic tubeplacement with bleeding from the nasopharynx.The aspirate should be tested for occult bloodusing either gastroccult or a urine test strip for blood, as both of these tests are pH-independent. In the case of esophageal varices, an NG tube can be placed carefully. Do not force the tube ifresistance is met. No evidence exists that suggests NG tube placement aggravates hemorrhage fromvarices or Mallory-Weiss tears. Patients who have had gastric bypass surgery or fundoplicationusually should not have an NG tube placed. Thisshould first be discussed with the appropriatesurgical service. Anoscopy Anoscopy can be performed at the bedside toevaluate for the presence of internal hemor-rhoids. It is indicated in patients with mild rectal bleeding who do not have an obvious source. Radiologic studies Radiographs Plain films of the abdomen are usually not indi- cated in most cases of GIB. If there is concern forruptured viscus associated with vomiting or in suspected cases of gastric or duodenal ulcers, aplain upright chest radiograph is indicated. Freeair under the diaphragm may be seen in perfo-rated ulcer, and air in the mediastinum may be dueto a ruptured esophagus. If there is concern forcardiac ischemia, a chest radiograph is indicated.Aplain abdominal film may show iron tablets in a case of suspected pediatric iron ingestion. Upper gastrointestinal studies Barium contrast studies are of limited value in the emergency management of GIB. The use of bariumcan limit the utility of subsequent endoscopy orangiography. General treatment principles The initial treatment approach is the same for upper and lower GI bleeding. Recognition of acutely ill patients is paramount. As with allemergency patients, airway, breathing, and circu-lation are attended to first. UGIB patients can haveairway difficulty if they have severe hematemesisfrom a bleeding varix or ulcer, and endotrachealintubation may be necessary. Blood loss mayresult in decreased level of consciousness necessi- tating intubation if patients are not breathing ade-quately. If blood loss is severe, patients may behypotensive and in shock. Supplemental oxygen,a cardiac monitor, and two large-bore intravenous(IV) catheters (18 G or larger) should be placedimmediately. If hypotension, tachycardia, or obvi-ous ongoing blood loss is detected, resuscitationshould be initiated with a crystalloid bolus, fol-lowed by early transfusion with type O blood(unless type-specific blood is available) should the vital signs remain abnormal. An initial bolus of 2 Lof crystalloid (adult) or 20 ml/kg (child) should beused. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is both diagnostic and in many cases therapeutic. Insevere bleeding, the airway must be secured beforeemergency EGD. Endoscopy provides visual eval-uation of 78-95% of UGIB patients. It allows localizationof bleeding, as well as an opportunity for thera-peutic intervention. Esophageal varices can eitherbe sclerosed, injected, or banded. Bleeding gastricor duodenal ulcers can be injected and sclerosed ifvisualized. If complete perforation is detected, sur-gery can be pursued. EGD with sclerotherapy has not been found to reduce mortality or rebleeding compared tovasoactive substances or other treatments in theinitial treatment of severe UGIB from esophagealvarices. It is, however, the diagnostic modality ofchoice, and repeat sclerotherapy or banding isthe long-term treatment of choice for esophagealvarices, in addition to treating underlying causes.EGD is not usually performed in the ED, but inthe intensive care unit (ICU) or endoscopy suiteif the patient is admitted, or the outpatient settingif discharged. UGIB patients rarely need EGD forstabilization. It is difficult to perform endoscopyon extremely critical patients that are bleedingheavily, as large amounts of blood may limitvisualization with the endoscope. Antacids Antacids should not be used for the treatment of UGIB. They have not been shown to decrease theincidence of bleeding. Antacids also can makeurgent or emergent EGD difficult by coating theesophageal or gastric mucosa. Somatostatin and octreotide These are vasoactive proteins that cause selective constriction of the splanchnic vascular bed anddecrease gastric acid secretion. The use of thesemedications decreases blood flow to the esopha-gus, stomach, and duodenum, usually decreas-ing blood loss from UGIB. Somatostatin isnaturally occurring, while octreotide is a syn-thetic equivalent. These vasoactive substanceshave shown limited effectiveness in decreasingUGIB, but no difference in mortality or rebleed- ing compared to endoscopic sclerotherapy. In arecent meta-analysis, use of these agents was associated with a slight decrease in the amount of blood products required. The use of these sub- stances with endoscopic sclerotherapy or bandingis a source of ongoing study and discussion. Vasopressin Vasopressin is a vasoconstrictor which effects the entire circulatory system, including the splanch- nic bed. It is extremely potent and should beused in an exsanguinating patient, whenendoscopy is unavailable or not possible.Vasopressin requires cautious use, because end- organ damage may occur. Histamine blockers and proton pump inhibitors Histamine (H2) blockers pump inhibitors (PPIs) decrease the acid secretion whichcontributes to gastric or duodenal ulcer forma-tion. These medications are routinely given topatients with UGIB, not to stop the bleeding, butto initiate ulcer or gastritis treatment. This mayreduce further bleeding in the future. Esophageal tamponade Direct pressure (tamponade) of bleeding esophageal varices may be performed whenvasoactive medications are not effective, andendoscopy is either ineffective or unavailable.Tamponade may temporarily control severe hem- orrhage in up to 80% of patients with bleedingesophageal varices. It can be used for 12-24 hours.Tamponade may be accomplished with a special- ized gastric tube that incorporates two expand-ing balloons. One balloon is first expanded in thestomach. A second balloon is then expanded inthe esophagus. There is a suction eye at the tip.The Sengstaken-Blakemore tube is the usual multi-lumen tube used for tamponade (Figure 24.1).Some tubes have a modification incorporating suc-tion eyes in the esophagus to decrease the risk of aspiration. A Linton tube has a single stomachballoon which is larger and more effective withgastric varices. Esophageal tamponade carries significant com- plications, including esophageal rupture, airwayGastrointestinal bleeding Primary Complaints 371Gastrointestinal bleedingGastrointestinal bleedingGastrointestinal bleeding 372 Primary Complaintscompression from the esophageal tube, and aspi- ration. Most cases of UGIB can be controlled withendoscopy or medications, but tamponaderemains an effective modality for extreme cases. Surgery This is the final option for a severe UGIB. Cases where bleeding does not stop or significantlydecrease after medication use, endoscopy, or tam-ponade need surgical intervention. Most UGIB stops after conservative treatment. However,ongoing blood loss, massive blood loss (5 units ofred blood cells transfused in 6 hours or 2 units of blood necessary every 4 hours) should prompt surgical intervention. If a patient requires 2 unitsof blood after crystalloid infusion to maintainblood pressure, surgical consultation should beconsidered. A surgical team should evaluatepatients with other morbidities early in a case of severe UGIB. EGD should be performed in theseextreme cases, but usually in the operating room (OR) under general anesthesia to guide surgical treatment or possibly provide direct sclerotherapy. Due to the risk of aortoenteric fistula, patients with a history of aortic graft placement and currentUGIB should be evaluated emergently by a vas-cular surgeon. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding Colonoscopy Colonoscopy provides direct visualization of bleeding sources and the opportunity for directtherapeutic intervention. Direct epinephrine injec-tion or electrical coagulation can stop bleeding sources. This is considered the intervention ofchoice for cases of LGIB. Colonoscopy is difficult on an emergent basis because it is best done afteradequate bowel preparation. It is not usuallydone in the ED. If urgent colonoscopy is antici-pated, an emergent bowel preparation can beperformed with NG administration of 2 L ofpolyethylene glycol. This can cause volume loss byosmotic diuresis, so hemodynamic status shouldbe followed closely, usually in the ICU setting. Sigmoidoscopy Sigmoidoscopy is performed on an outpatient basis to evaluate the sigmoid colon for diverticu-lae,polyps or tumors. It is reserved for cases of mild LGIB. Arteriography Arteriography can detect 0.5 ml of GIB per minute. Since the advent of endoscopy, it is only used in 1% of UGIB cases. Arteriography is more com-monly used in LGIB cases. It can identify the site of bleeding, but rarely diagnoses the cause. Ifbleeding is detected, vasopressin or epinephrinecan be injected locally or embolization can be per- formed to stop the bleeding. There is a 2% com-plication rate including dye reaction, arterialdissection, or ischemia related to vasopressin.The use of angiography in the setting of GIBdepends on individual institutional practice, avail- ability, and operator expertise. It is usuallyreserved for significant, persistent, or intermit tent LGIB that cannot be localized by endoscopy. Itusually is performed outside of the ED setting,after admission to the hospital. Tagged red blood cell imaging Technetium ( 99mTc) tagged red blood cells can detect LGIB of 0.1 ml/min. An initial scan is done and delayed scans are compared in an attempt tolocalize bleeding. This scanning is rarely done in Figure 24.1 Sengstaken-Blakemore tube.Gastrointestinal bleedingthe ED setting. Tagged cell scans should be ordered in consultation with either the gastro-enterology or surgical service. Vasopressin Vasopressin is a vasoconstrictor which effects the entire circulatory system, including the splanch- nic bed. It is very potent and should be used onlyin an exsanguinating LGIB patient. Colonoscopylacks utility for the initial stabilization of LGIB,so vasopressin may be necessary until sur gery or emergent preparation and colonoscopy can be performed. Vasopressin requires cautious use,because end-organ damage may occur. Surgery When arteriography is unsuccessful in LGIB, emergent surgery may be necessary. If lower GI hemorrhage is significant and ongoing (5 units of red blood cells transfused in 6 hours or 2 units necessary every 4 hours), surgery may berequired. Arteriography provides a guide to the surgical location for hemicolectomy or other inter-vention. Indications for transfusion If a patient has low blood pressure or evidence ofvolume depletion after an initial crystalloid bolusof 2 L for adults or 20-40 ml/kg in children, trans-fusion should be started. Patients with severe dis-tress, cardiac ischemia, or massive blood lossshould receive blood products as soon as pos-sible. If type-specific blood is not available, thentype O blood (Rh-negative in females) should betransfused. Type-specific and then cross-matchedblood should be used as soon as possible. Serial Hgb values should be monitored closely, and if blood losses are ongoing, transfusion shouldoccur. If platelet counts are less than 50,000/ml,platelets should be transfused. Indications for fresh frozen plasma or vitamin K Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be adminis- tered in patients who have GIB and elevated pro-thrombin times (PT). This occurs in patients withliver disease, vitamin K deficiencies, warfarin therapy, or coagulopathies (e.g., disseminatedintra vascular coagulation (DIC) or hemophilia). If the PT is elevated and bleeding is ongoing, cross-matched FFP is given. Vitamin K can be given inthe ED; however, its effect is delayed and will notstop acute bleeding. Special patients Pediatric The most common cause of UGIB in children isesophagitis, followed by gastritis, ulcer, varices,and Mallory-Weiss tears. The most commoncauses of LGIB in decreasing frequency are analfissures, infectious colitis, inflammatory boweldisease, polyps, and intussusception. Formula intolerance should be considered in infants. Intussusception should be considered in children age 3-12 months with colicky pain and hema- tochezia. \"Currant-jelly\" stool is the classicdescription, but is a late finding. The manage-ment of GIB in children is simi lar to that in adults. More often the cause of bleeding is benign and can be managed on an outpatient basis. The emergency physician should keep in mind that much smaller blood losses may result in hemo-dynamic instability. Children with large or ongo-ing blood loss, vital sign abnormalities, orco-morbidities should be admitted. Elderly Geriatric patients are often on medications that canmake the assessment of hypotension and signifi-cant blood loss more difficult. Beta-blockers canobscure the diagnosis of hypovolemia by prevent-ing tachycardia. Geriatric patients are more likelyto have vague complaints, and may present withonly a change in mental status or weakness. Theyhave a higher morbidity and mortality from GIB;as such, clinicians need to maintain a high level ofsuspicion. Geriatric patients may have visual diffi-culties making it difficult to identify blood, hema-tochezia, or melena. Subsequent problems withcardiac ischemia or respiratory compromise as aresult of GIB may occur, as geriatric patients have less hemodynamic and physiologic reserve. Emer-gency physicians must have a low threshold foradmission and further evaluation of these patients. Immune compromised Patients with malignancy, human immunodefi-ciency virus (HIV), and those on immunosup-pressants are at a higher risk of infectiouscomplications. Patients treated with steroids havea higher risk of forming ulcers, possibly resultingin GIB. Steroids may also prevent a proper stress Primary Complaints 373Gastrointestinal bleedingGastrointestinal bleedingGastrointestinal bleeding 374 Primary Complaintsresponse to bleeding and hypovolemia. Supple- mental corticosteroids may be necessary for a patient in refractory shock who usually takessteroids. Disposition Guidelines for specialty consultation or admission Any patient who is unstable or has an Hgb less than 10 g/dL should be admitted to the hospitaland evaluated by a gastroenterologist. In the case ofunstable LGIB, a general surgeon should evaluatethe patient if severe bleeding is not controlled with vasoactive medicine or arteriography. Patientswith GIB who continue to be unstable, continueto bleed, or have comorbidities should be admittedto the ICU. Ill-appearing patients with inflamma- tory bowel disease should be admitted for antibi-otics and colonoscopy. Patients with LGIB,except from fissures, hemorrhoids, or mild proc-titis should be admitted for further evaluation.Patients with UGIB and a history of AAA repairneed emergent evaluation by a vascular surgeon.Patients with GIB and comorbidities should alsobe considered for admission, except in cases thatare low-risk for further bleeding and can easilybe followed on an outpatient basis. Guidelines for emergency department observation Apatient with UGIB that has stopped, with a small to moderate amount of bleeding, and an Hgb greater than 10 g/dL may be evaluated in an obser- vation unit for early diagnostic endoscopy. SerialHgb levels are followed, looking for a drop of2g/dL or more, which usually leads to admis sion. Patients with LGIB are not routinely evaluated inan observation setting, because colonoscopy isusually warranted and is not easily done in ashort observation setting. Guidelines for discharge Historically, all patients with GIB were admitted.With continuing changes in health care, low-risk patients are often evaluated on an outpatient basis.Stable UGIB patients with a normal Hgb, few or nocomorbidities, and a small amount of bleeding thathas resolved may be discharged if close follow-up(1-2 days) is available. Patients with LGIB from abenign source (hemorrhoids or fissures) may bedischarged with primary care follow-up.Discharged patients should be given precau- tions and instructions about any further bleed ing, with specific instructions regarding when theyshould return to the ED or contact their primarycare physician. Patients should return if bleedingrecurs, or if symptoms of volume depletion (dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, or nearsyncope), chest pain, shortness of breath, melena,or hematochezia develop. Patients should alsoreturn if they have new symptoms, or any other problems or concerns. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths The most common cause of massive LGIB isan UGIB site with a brisk transit time. The Hgb may not initially reflect a largedegree of bleeding; serial measurements arenecessary. NG suction has a false-negative rate. Previous requires early vascular surgery consultation forpossible aortoenteric fistula. Be very cautious with elderly patients andGIB. Comorbidities make these patientshighly susceptible to associated morbidityand mortality. GIB is a common cause of altered mental statusand generalized weakness in the elderly. References 1.Bono MJ.

However, only a small percentage ofthem seek medical care. Headaches account forapproximately 2 million emergency department(ED) visits each year in the US. A patient with aheadache may have a serious or minor etiologyfor his or her headache. The differential diagnosisof headache is complex and long. Headache can be divided into primary or secondary dis-orders (T able 25.1). Primary headaches, such as migraines, cluster, and tension-type headachesaccount for 90% of headaches in clinical practice.Secondary headaches include tumors, aneurysms,and meningitis, and have an identifiable, distinctpathologic process in which head pain is a pre-senting symptom. Most patients presenting to the ED have a benign headache requiring sympto-matic treatment and referral. A small subset ofpatients who present with a headache will have alife-threatening illness; it is the primary goal of thetreating clinician to identify these patients andprovide appropriate care.Anatomic essentials The pain from headache can originate fromextracranial or intracranial structures. Extracranialstructures that can cause pain include skin, bloodvessels, muscles, and bone. The brain parenchyma,most of the dura, the arachnoid, and pia materhave no pain fibers and do not produce pain.Intracranial structures with pain fibers includevenous sinuses, the dura at the base of the skull,dural arteries, the falx cerebri, and large arteriesat the base of the brain. The fifth cranial nerve (CN) carries pain fibers from structures above the tentorium and supplies most of the facial areas. CNs IX, X, and XI alongwith upper cervical nerves carry these pain fibersbelow the tentorium, resulting in pain referred tothe neck and back of the head. History Adetailed history is the most important part of the evaluation of a patient with a headache. Athorough history will identify \"danger signs\" inpatients complaining of headaches (Table 25.2). How did the pain begin (sudden vs. gradual onset) and how long has it beenpresent? These are two crucial questions to ask while obtaining a history. A patient with sudden onsetof a severe unprecedented headache, with orwithout neurologic deficits, should be investi-gated for ruptured aneurysm or subarachnoidhemorrhage (SAH). Gradual onset of headachesthat have persisted for weeks or months suggest25 Headache Gino A. Farina, MDand Kumar Alagappan, MD Table 25.1 Major categories of headaches Table 25.2 Historical danger signs in patients with headache Sudden onset of headache (thunderclap) Worst headache of life Headache dramatically different from past headaches Headache in a patient who is immunocompromised New onset of headache after the age of 50 Headache that begins with exertionPrimary Migraines Tension Cluster Secondary Head pressure, non-infectiousinflammatory disease, intracranial neoplasm) Substance use or withdrawal Infection (meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess,or acute febrile illness (hypoxia, othermetabolic abnormalities) Cranial-facial and other cranial-facialstructures) NeuralgiasHeadache 376 Primary Complaintstension headaches. New headaches that worsen in intensity over weeks are suspicious for masseffect associated with increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Episodic headaches with symp-tom-free intervals suggest migraine or clusterheadaches. Frontal or occipital headaches thatbegin 24-48 hours after a lumbar puncture (LP), known as post-dural headaches, may be secondary to a persistent cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) leak. What time of day is your headache worse? If a patient complains that they wake up with a headache, one must consider hypertension, clus-ter, or neoplastic etiologies. However, patientswith tension headaches often awaken pain-freeand develop their headache as the day pro-gresses. What were you doing when the pain began? The activity being performed or the events pre- ceding the onset of headache often provide valu-able clues to the etiology. A sudden onset of the\"worst headache of my life\" at rest or during anyactivity is highly suggestive of SAH. If theheadache begins while in a car with the enginerunning or the patient is a victim of a fire, carbon monoxide (CO) has to be considered. Headachesand dizziness are the two most common com-plaints of CO poisoning. A headache that occursduring or immediately after sex may be a coitalor post-coital headache. A patient may experi-ence a severe but benign headache after cough-ing, sneezing, laughing, heavy lifting, stooping,or any Valsalva maneuver. The pain starts withina few seconds of the activity and may last for afew seconds to minutes. The sudden nature andseverity of these headaches sometimes simulatean acute SAH. Headache associated with hunger,stress, sleep deprivation, menses, specific typesof food ingestion, or oral contraceptive use sug-gests migraine. Any history of remote or recenttrauma prior to the headache also must be ascer-tained. What does the pain feel like? The character of the pain is important, and may be useful in determining an etiology. Severe,intense, sudden onset, or \"thunderclap\"headaches may be the result of SAH. A pulsatilepain that correlates with the patient's pulse is usu-ally vascular in origin. If the pain is pulsatile butdoes not correlate with the pulse, it is nonspecific.Adull, constant band-like occipitofrontal headache is characteristic of tension headache. Where is your pain? The location of pain may be helpful in narrowing the diagnosis. Unilateral headaches are sugges-tive of migraines or a mass on the ipsilateral side.Unilateral facial pain is seen with trigeminal neu-ralgia, sinusitis, and carotid artery dissection.Headaches that progress from bilat-eral may be from increased ICP . Vertex headachesare seen and thrombosis. Occipital headaches muscle spasm, and cervicalradiculopathy. However, an acute occipitocervicalheadache can be associated with intracranialpathology, especially when accompanied by othersymptoms. Does anything make the pain better or worse? Aheadache that worsens with coughing, bend- ing, or turning the head may be associated with a mass lesion or sinusitis. Post-dural punctureheadaches generally improve or disappear withrecumbence and worsen when the patient is upright. What medications are you taking or have you changed any medications? Headache is one of the most common side effects of prescribed medications. Medications thatcommonly cause headaches include nitroglycer-ine, hydralazine, calcium channel blockers, digi-talis, and estrogen. Patients who stop drinkingcoffee may develop a headache within 24-48hours of abstinence. The headache resolves fol-lowing ingestion of caffeine. Alcohol, marijuana,and amphetamines may also induce headaches.Apatient who uses cocaine may have a headache due to an intracranial bleed. Have you had the pain before? Patients with migraine, cluster and tension headaches often have a history of similarPrimary Complaints 377Headacheheadaches and symptoms. Migraine headaches typically start in childhood, adolescence, or youngadulthood, and patients often have a history ofprevious attacks. A significant change in inten-sity, location, or character from prior headachesmay indicate serious new pathology, such as aSAH. A recent severe headache may represent asentinel bleed from a cerebral aneurysm. Patients with tension headaches may also have a previoushistory of similar headaches. Periodicity is themain feature of cluster headaches. Suspicion iswarranted when an elderly patient complains of anew-onset headache. New headaches in patientsover 50 years of age should raise concern for glau-coma, intracranial lesions, and temporal arteritis. Associated signs and symptoms Nausea or vomiting Nausea and vomiting are commonly seen with migraine headaches, in patients with SAH,meningitis, post-LP headaches, or those withincreased ICP . Photophobia Photophobia can be due to irritation of the meninges from SAH or meningitis, and is a com-mon complaint in migraine headache patients. Itcan also arise from a pathologic problem with theeyes, such as iritis, uveitis, or acute angle closureglaucoma. Neck stiffness Neck stiffness, particularly the inability to flex the neck or resistance to neck flexion, can be a sign ofmeningeal irritation from SAH or meningitis. Fever It is important to ask about fever, as the majority of patients with bacterial meningitis will have afever on presentation to the ED. Fever is not aspecific finding, however, because it can be a sec-ondary cause of a headache. Other Unilateral nasal congestion, tearing, and con- junctival injection may be seen with clusterheadaches. A patient with temporal arteritis willoften complain of polymyalgias. Patients withmigraine headaches may develop visual ormeningeal findings such as photophobia. Visualfield deficits, diplopia, seizures, and syncope areassociated with SAH. In a patient who is preg-nant, headache may be a sign of preeclampsia. Past medical and family Apositive family history is present in 70% of patients with migraines. There is no family his-tory with cluster headaches. A family history ofSAH is a risk factor for SAH. There is a familialassociation of cerebral aneurysms with severaldiseases, including autosomal . A previous neurosurgery or malig-nancy (with potential for metastases) pathology, includ-ing a malfunctioning indwelling shunt. Physical examination General appearance The patient's general appearance is an importantclinical observation that helps gauge the degreeof distress. It may not help distinguish a life-threatening from benign condition. A patientwith a small SAH (sentinel bleed) may be com-fortable, particularly if the aneurysm has not yetcompletely ruptured, as opposed to a patientwith a migraine headache who may be in severediscomfort. Vital signs Vital signs can be abnormal in patients with a headache. Tachycardia and tachypnea may besecondary to pain. An elevated blood pressuremay be seen with SAH. An elevated temperaturemay indicate an intracranial infection. Head Inspection and palpation of the head may revealevidence of trauma. Tenderness in the area of thesinuses or teeth may be clues to the diagnosis;however, purulent nasal secretions and abnormalsinus of sinusitis. Always palpate the temporalartery in the elderly patient. Temporal arteritismay present only with a complaint of headache.Atender area of the scalp that exactly reproduces the head pain may indicate neuralgia.Eyes Athorough eye examination should be performed in all patients with a headache. The examination should assess the visual acuity, pupil size,extraocular movements, and for evidence of pho-tophobia. Patients with acute angle closure glau-coma may present with a headache. Signsinclude conjunctival injection, mid-dilated intraocular pressure, and of extraocular move-ments may reveal a CN deficit, which mayrepresent a mass lesion or aneurysm. Fundoscopic examination should also be per-formed to check for spontaneous venous pulsa-tions (SVPs), subtle pulsations of the centralretinal vein just where it emerges from the optic disk. The absence of SVPs suggests papilledema,a sign of increased ICP . Subhyaloid or pre-retinalhemorrhages are seen with SAH, whereas and exudates may be secondary tohypertensive encephalopathy. Occasionally apatient may develop a headache because he orshe has a refractive error and needs correctivelenses, although the headache is usually not sud-den in onset. Skin Look for rash associated with meningococcemia(Figure 23.3), Rocky Mountain spotted fever(Figure 30.8), or vasculitis. Neurologic Acomplete neurologic examination on patients with headaches must be performed. Thisincludes assessment of mental status, cranialnerves, motor, sensory, and cerebellar function.The presence of new focal neurologic deficits,seizures, or cognitive impairment mandatesimaging studies of the brain. Careful attention tothe cranial nerves may reveal abnormal CN III orVI function, indicate examination should be performed with the patient supine and relaxed, looking for involuntary resistance with passive flexion. Painor resistance to flexion suggest meningealinflammation, but may also be due to arthritis orneck injury. Brudzinki's sign While passively flexing the neck as described above, watch for flexion of the patient's hips andknees in reaction to this maneuver (Figure 25.1).If present, this also suggests meningeal inflam-mation. Brudzinki's sign is neither sensitive norspecific for meningitis. Kernig's sign Flex one of the patient's legs at the hip and knee, and then straighten at the knee. Pain or resistance to this suggests meningeal irritation (Figure 25.2). Kernig's sign is neither sensitivenor specific for meningitis. Jolt accentuation of headache This maneuver is performed by asking the patient to turn his or her head horizontally at afrequency of 2-3 rotations per second. Worseningof the baseline headache represents a positivesign. The jolt accentuation sign has a sensitivity Headache 378 Primary Complaints 90\u00b0 Figure 25.2 Kernig's sign. 2 1 Figure 25.1 Brudzinki's sign.Primary Complaints 379Headacheof 97% and specificity of 60% for meningitis, but has only been studied in a small sample ofpatients (Table 25.3).

(continued )Diagnostic testing Radiologic studies If the diagnosis of migraine, cluster, tension, or post-dural puncture headache can be made fromthe history and physical examination, then imag-ing studies are unnecessary. If the diagnosis isunclear then computed tomography (CT) of thehead or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ofthe brain should be performed to delineate lesions that may be responsible for the headache. CT is preferred for the detection of acute intracranialhemorrhage, increased ICP , and hydrocephalus.In a patient with a headache and human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV), CT with contrast mayreveal a CT also identifyapproximately 90% of patients with SAH, and isbest when performed in the first 24 hours follow-ing headache onset (Figure 25.4).

CBC: complete of secondary headache ( cont)Primary Complaints 385Headache MRI is generally not required in the initial work-up of a patient with a headache. When available, however, it is preferred in certain clinicalsituations. MRI has a higher sensitivity than CTfor the detection of SAH after 24 hours and non-hemorrhagic strokes in the first 24-48 hours. MRIis also superior to CT at visualizing the posteriorfossa, localizing tumors and focal infections, anddiagnosing cavernous sinus thrombosis andcarotid artery dissection. Laboratory studies Laboratory tests may be performed depending onthe clinical scenario. For example, if an infection issuspected, blood cultures and a complete bloodcount (CBC) may be required. However, patientswith meningitis may have a normal white bloodcell count. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) is elevated in patients with temporal arteri-tis; physicians should consider ordering this test inan elderly patient with a headache. A CO levelshould be obtained when there is a suspicion of COpoisoning. One should not rely on pulse oximetryor an arterial blood gas (ABG) alone to rule out COpoisoning. The arterial oxygen concentration andhence the calculated oxygen saturation reported onan ABG are usually normal since CO does notaffect dissolved oxygen in the serum. Co-oximetrycan measure oxygen saturation directly. The meas-ured oxygen saturation will be less than the calcu-lated oxygen saturation by the amount roughlyequal to the percent of CO-hemoglobin present . Serum chemistries should be performed whenthere is concern for electrolyte abnormalities, suchas in patients with profuse vomiting, prolongeddiarrhea, diabetes mellitus, or seizures. CSF analysis is required when there is suspi- cion of intracranial infection, or when SAH is sus-pected and CT of the head does not demonstratesubarachnoid blood. When SAH is likely, the CSFanalysis should include a cell count from the firstand last tube collected. This is done to distinguisha traumatic LP from SAH. If the number of redblood cells (RBCs) does not significantly decreasefrom the first to the last tube (which suggests pos-sible SAH), the patient needs a neurosurgical eval-uation and a cerebral angiogram (Figure 25.5).The CSF also needs to be examined for xan-thochromia, a yellowish discoloration of the CSFcaused by pigment released from the breakdownof RBCs in the CSF (Figure 25.6). This may be donevisually, but is more accurately done with a spec-trophotometer. Presence of xanthochromia alsowarrants neurosurgical evaluation and a cerebralangiogram. When performing an LP , an openingpressure should be measured. An opening spinalpressure /H11022200 mmH 2O is seen in idiopathic intracranial other conditions thatmay have an increased ICP , such as meningitis. General treatment principles All patients presenting with headache to the ED should be evaluated in a timely fashion. All pat-ients deserve symptomatic relief; some willrequire a work-up. Treatment with analgesics can be initiated while the diagnostic studies areperformed. The patient should be placed in aquiet and dark area of the ED so as not to exacer-bate the symptoms. After performing a physical examination, if the patient can tolerate oral intake and is not asurgical candidate, the patient may be given oralanalgesics. If oral intake cannot be tolerated,intravenous (IV) access must be obtained forhydration and administration of analgesics, andpossibly anti-emetics. Many of the secondary headaches, such as those resulting from cold stimulus, alcohol, exertion, cough, hypertension, MSG, or side-effects of medications improve with treatment ofthe primary disorder or avoidance of the preci-pitating event or medication. Symptomatic treat-ment with acetaminophen may be beneficial. Figure 25.4 attacks, acetaminophen, aspirin, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs (NSAIDs) are recommended. For moder-ate to severe attacks, if the patient cannot toler-ate oral intake, intramuscular or be ofvalue as well. Refractory attacks (status migrain-osus) are best treated with parenteral dihydro-ergotamine and IV steroids (Table 25.6). (a) (b) Figure 25.5 Basilar tip aneurysm.

Dihydroergotamine parenterally has also been shown to be effective. Intranasal application of lidocaine to produceanesthesia of the sphenopalantine region hasbeen advocated but not proven to be effective.Steroids have also been used. Tension and cervicogenic headaches Treatment is symptomatic with analgesics, ice, relaxation techniques, and trigger point injections. Subarachnoid hemorrhage The initial management of SAH includes resusci-tation, stabilization, and emergent neurosurgicalconsultation. The main goals are to prevent recur-rent bleeding, prevent further increase in ICP , mitigate the effects of vasospasm, and treat acutemedical and neurologic complications. Continuedor recurrent bleeding is worsened by uncon-trolled elevations in blood pressure. To reducethe likelihood of an ischemic stroke, nimodipineshould be started soon after the diagnosis ofSAH is made. The recommended dose is 60 mgevery 4 hours by mouth or nasogastric tube.Blood pressure must be monitored closely to pre-vent hypotension. Patients with a Hunt and Hessclassification grade III or higher SAH are at riskfor respiratory depression, which can lead tohypercapnia and worsening ICP (Table 25.7).These patients may require early endotrachealintubation with precautions to prevent elevationin ICP . Analgesics should be used and NSAIDs,including aspirin, be avoided because oftheir antiplatelet effects. Antiemetics may berequired. Agents that lower the seizure thresholdshould be avoided, since these patients are at anincreased risk for seizures. Prophylactic anticon-vulsant therapy is controversial and should beinstituted in consultation with neurosurgery.Most of these patients require monitoring in anintensive care setting. Epidural hematoma Patients with an epidural hematoma can deterio-rate rapidly; emergent neurosurgicalevaluation and treatmentis hematoma Patients subdural hematoma also requireemergent neurosurgical evaluation. The neuro-surgeon may opt to observe the patient ratherthan rushing him or her to an operating room,depending on the size, location, and duration ofthe hematoma. Giant cell arteritis Giant cell arteritis must be treated promptly oncethe diagnosis is suspected due to the risk of permanent visual loss. Steroids are the mainstayof therapy. The recommended initial oral dose ofprednisone is 60-120 mg/day. Therapy needs to becontinued for months, although symptomaticresponse may be seen within several days of initia- tion of steroids. The ESR needs to be closely moni-tored. A definitive diagnosis requires a temporalartery biopsy, which should be performed within 1week of starting steroid therapy. A positive resultmay be seen up to 1 month later. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension Treatment involves lowering the ICP as well as symptomatic treatment of the headache. Acetazo-lamide decr eases CSF production and lowers the ICP . Steroids have also been used. Repeated LPsare sometimes used to remove CSF , but such ther- apy is typically not well-tolerated by patients. Inpatients with impending visual loss, a ventricular shunt may be indicated. Tumor headache Urgent neurosurgical consultation is required oncethis diagnosis is made. Treatment includes manag-ing increased ICP and seizures. ICP elevation froma brain tumor is initially managed with steroids.Table 25.7 Hunt and Hess clinical grading scale for subarachnoid hemorrhage Grade Condition 0 Unruptured aneurysm 1 Asymptomatic or minimal headache and nuchal rigidity 2 Moderate or severe headache, nuchalrigidity, no neurologic deficit other than cranial nerve palsy 3 Drowsiness, confusion, or mild focal deficit 4 Stupor, moderate or severe hemiparesis 5 Deep coma, decerebrate posturing,moribund appearancePrimary Complaints 389HeadacheDexamethasone is a high-potency steroid used to treat edema associated with brain tumors. Thestarting dose is 10 mg IV followed by 4 mg every 6hours. Seizures are managed with agents such asphenytoin, valproic acid, or carbamazepine. Meningitis The specific treatment of the varied types ofmeningitis is beyond the scope of this chapter.Empiric treatment with broad-spectrum anti-biotics pending cultures is prudent. IV steroids are now recommended prior to antibiotics for patientswith bacterial etiologies. Acute angle closure glaucoma Urgent ophthalmologic consultation is requiredonce the diagnosis of acute angle closure glaucomais made. The initial treatment involves loweringthe intraocular pressure with topical beta-blockers(such as timolol maleate) and oral or IV acetazo-lamide. Miotics (such as pilocarpine) are used toconstrict neuralgia the treatment trigeminal neuralgia.However, all of these therapies have high failurerates, and surgical management may be required. Post-dural puncture headache Once identified by history, the patient should betreated with hydration, bed rest, and analgesics.Oral or IV caffeine can produce symptomaticrelief (i.e., 500 mg of caffeine sodium benzoate in 1 liter of normal saline over 1 hour). When con-servative methods have failed, an epidural bloodpatch (placed by an anesthesiologist) can behighly effective. Carbon monoxide Treatment is with 100% oxygen. Some patients may require hyperbaric oxygen therapy depend-ing on the CO level and their symptomatology. Carotid and vertebral artery dissection Treatment is aimed at stroke prevention from embolization, and includes early anticoagulationfollowed by antiplatelet therapy.Cavernous sinus thrombosis requires high-dose IV antibiotics that cover staphylococcal, streptococcal, andHaemophilus influenza organisms. In addition, neurosurgical consultation as well as ophthalmo-logic or otolaryngologic consultation, dependingon the location of the primary infection, shouldbe obtained in a timely fashion. Special patients Elderly Elderly patients with headache need special con-sideration. Chronic disease and normal physio-logic changes with aging contribute to atypicalpresentations in the elderly. Elderly patients canpresent with only a mild headache and have asubacute or chronic subdural hematoma from aminor traumatic event. Up to 20% a chronic subdural hematoma have no iden-tifiable precipitant or present with symptoms upto 3 months following a known traumatic event.Certain diseases, such as temporal arteritis, pres-ent later in life. It is rare for an elderly patient todevelop a new migraine headache. A thoroughwork-up including a low threshold for a CT scanis required for any elderly patient who presentswith a headache. Immune compromised Immunocompromised patients can suffer from anyof the headaches described above, but requirespecial consideration because of their immunestatus. This group of patients is at risk for oppor-tunistic central nervous system infections, central nervous system lymphomaand Kaposi's sarcoma. Noncontrast and contrastCT scan must be performed on any immunocom-promised patient with a headache to rule out aspace-occupying lesion, especially if an LP isbeing considered. Pediatric Headache is common in children and adolescents;40% of children will experience a headache by theage of 7 years and 75% will experience a headacheby the time they are 15 years old. Migraine is oneHeadache 390 Primary Complaintsof the most common causes of headache in child- hood, occurring in 1% of children by the age of 7and 5% of children by 15 years of age. An acute headache may accompany many infectious processes. Nonspecific viral illnessesrepresent the most common diagnoses in children presenting with headaches. Care must be takento exclude serious illnesses, such as meningitis,hypertension, and SAH as the cause. Pediatricpatients with meningitis usually present with ahistory of headache accompanied by other sys-temic symptoms, such as changes in behavior,lethargy, seizures, and shock. Patients withmildly or severely elevated blood pressure maypresent with headache, and require rapid assess-ment to determine the etiology of their elevatedblood pressure. Pediatric patients with SAHpresent similarly to adult patients with severeheadache. They usually have neurologic abnor-malities or a change in consciousness. Pregnant The most common type of headache occurringduring pregnancy is a muscle contractionheadache. Most patients have a previous historyof headaches prior to the pregnancy. Eighty per-cent of women with classic migraine headacheshave remission from attacks during pregnancy;thus, any headache other than a muscle contrac-tion headache requires investigation. Brain tumors enlarge during pregnancy and shrink temporarily postpartum. Most tumorsbecome symptomatic during the second half ofpregnancy. Brain tumors account for 10% ofmaternal deaths during pregnancy. Pseudotumor cerebri associated with preg- nancy usually occurs in obese women and beginsbetween the third and fifth months of pregnancy.Symptoms usually resolve spontaneously after1-3 months. Spontaneous SAH accounts for 10% of mater- nal deaths. The most common cause of SAH inwomen younger than 25 years is a berry aneurysm.For women older than 25 years, it is an arterio-venous malformation. Nearly one-third of spon-taneous SAHs are the result of bleeding disorders,bacterial endocarditis, metastatic tumors, or sicklecell disease. Patients with eclampsia present with the sud- den onset of focal neurologic deficits in addition toheadache, seizure, or altered consciousness. Themost common cause of death in patients witheclampsia is cerebral hemorrhage, occurring in60% of patients who die after becoming eclamptic.Disposition Most patients presenting with a headache to theED can be managed as outpatients. Specific treat-ment modalities are discussed in Table 25.6.Table 25.8 lists indications for hospitalization of patients with headache. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Consider SAH in any patient who presentswith the first or worst headache of their life. SAH and meningitis need to be considered in patients presenting with a change in thecharacter, location, or intensity of theirheadache. Always perform a thorough eye examinationon patients with a headache. The headachemay be due to acute angle closure glaucoma.Identifying this condition may preventunnecessary testing and delays in treatment. The typical patient with idiopathic intracranialhypertension is young, female, overweight,with acne on tetracycline. Fundoscopicexamination reveals papilledema. Anormal head CT and an elevated openingpressure confirm the diagnosis. Consider CO poisoning when a patientpresents with a headache and nausea, andother family members have similar symptoms. Always consider giant cell arteritis in anelderly patient who presents with aheadache, especially if it is unilateral.Table 25.8 Indications for hospitalization of patients with headache Central nervous system infections Vascular diseases -Subarachnoid hemorrhage encephalopathy Idiopathic intracranial hypertension not responding to usual measures Headache associated with severe medical illness Severe intractable headache Continuous vomiting, electrolyte abnormalities orinability to maintain oral hydration Complex drug interactions Social situations preventing appropriate outpatientmanagementPrimary Complaints 391HeadacheCT scanning is not 100% sensitive for the detection of SAH. A negative head CT mustbe followed by a negative LP to exclude thediagnosis. Be wary of assigning the diagnosis of \"new-onset migraines\" to an elderly patient withtheir first headache.

Williams &Wilkins, 2000.Primary Complaints 393Hypertensive urgencies and emergencies Scope of the problem Hypertension (HTN) affects more than 20% of the adult and 3% of the pediatric populations. It is a disease process that contributes to thedevelopment of cardiovascular and renal dis-eases. It appears to be a polygenic, multifactorialdisorder with several genes interacting withenvironmental factors. It is defined by a systolicblood pressure (SBP) greater than 140, dias-tolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90, orsomeone requiring antihypertensive medica-tions for control of sustained elevations of bloodpressure (BP). As a disease process, HTN was born out of epidemiological studies that showed chronic BPelevation decreased life expectancy; that treat-ment of HTN reduces stroke, coronary artery disease (CAD), and heart failure; and that mosthypertensive patients require more than one agentto achieve BP control. HTN is an asymptomatic disease process. The exception is a hypertensive emergency. Hyper-tensive emergencies and urgencies, also knownas hypertensive cause end-organ dys-function and require controlled management.These hypertensive crises can be viewed as acontinuum of the disease process in somepatients. Ahypertensive emergency , also known as malig- nant HTN, defined as an acute elevation in BP(DBP /H11022130 mmHg in general) with end-organ dysfunction or damage. It requires prompt par-enteral treatment with a goal of 25% reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP) within 30-60minutes. Ahypertensive urgency is defined as moderately severe to severe HTN with DBP 120-140 mmHgwithout presenting signs or symptoms of malig-nant HTN or a concomitant emergency medicalcondition. However, these patients are at risk for imminent end-organ damage. Hypertensiveurgencies require controlled lowering of BP overseveral days, which can generally be accom-plished in the outpatient setting.Pathophysiology The primary event for initiating any hyper-tensive crises is an increase of arterial pressure.The triggers for this rapid rise in pressure areunknown. They likely include a combination ofcellular, organ, and environmental systems. It isclear that the rate of rise in arterial pressure ismore important than the absolute level of pres-sure. Without prompt control of arterial pressure,fibrinoid necrosis of small arterioles occurs withresultant ischemia and infarction of end organs. This is followed by end-organ dysfunction anddamage. The process of fibrinoid necrosis of small arteri- oles begins when vessels in the capillary bedsdilate to accommodate the sustained elevation inBP . Presumably, force causes damage tothe endothelium with resultant vascular wallinjury. Response to this injury is the activation ofcoagulation and cell proliferation mediators.Fibrin is deposited within the damaged vascularwalls. The process is continuously repeated andresults in progressive narrowing and stiffening of the arterioles. Flow through the vessels in the capillary beds is autoregulated to ensure that end organs areadequately perfused. This autoregulation occurswithin specific ranges of BP in end organs.Beyond these specific ranges, autoregulation ofblood flow does not occur, and hypo- or hyper-perfusion of end organs results. In patients withsustained elevations in BP , the specific range ofautoregulation is shifted higher. Therefore,acutely lowering the BP in hypertensive patientscan result in evidence of hypoperfusion of endorgans, since autoregulation of blood flow hasbeen disrupted. Changes in blood flow through end organs have clinical relevance. Stroke, intracerebral hem-orrhage, and hypertensive encephalopathy can occur as a result of hyperperfusion of the brain.Angina, myocardial infarction, and acute left ven-tricular dysfunction with resultant pulmonary edema can occur as a result of hypoperfusion26 emergencies Loretta Jackson-Williams, urgencies and emergencies 394 Primary Complaintsthrough the coronary arteries. In the kidneys, renal impairment and failure result from hypoperfusion.Aortic dissection may result from hyperperfu-sion to this structure. History The evaluation of a patient with elevated BP inthe emergency department (ED) should focus on determining the presence of any end-organ dysfunction or concomitant emergency medical conditions. Primary areas of focus include theneurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renalsystems. What were the onset and duration of presenting signs and symptoms? This information will help determine appropriate disposition and referral. Patients with long-standing HTN may not present with evidence of malignant HTN because of autoregulatorymechanisms previously discussed. Hypertensiveemergencies typically present with acute onsetand rapid progression within minutes to hours. Neurologic Does the patient have a severe headache? In general, headache in hypertensive patients is a nonspecific sign and is not a reliable indicatorof elevated BP . Severe headache may representhypertensive encephalopathy or intracranial hem-orrhage. Does the patient have any speech or gait abnormalities, focal sensory or motordeficits, or mental status changes? These questions address areas of the neuro- logic examination related to specific stroke syn- dromes. Focal deficits secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy may not follow a single anatomicpattern. In addition, autonomic instability mani-fested by dizziness, syncope, tremor, or abnormal sweating should be assessed. Ophthalmologic Does the patient have visual disturbances or loss of vision? Decreased visual acuity or the presence of visual field defects may indicate the development ofretinopathy. In addition, amaurosis fugax or painless monocular blindness identifies a strokeinvolving the internal carotid artery and theanterior circulation of the brain. Cardiovascular Does the patient complain of dyspnea orchest pain? Acute left heart failure will result in the sen-sation of breathlessness or dyspnea, especiallywith exertion. Patients may also develop rightheart failure and complain of the development of or worsening peripheral edema. Acute coronary syndromes can be precipitated by severe eleva-tions in BP . Does the patient complain of abdominal or back pain? Patients with these complaints should be assessed for an aortic dissection or aneurysmal dilatation. Obstetric Is the patient pregnant? Because of profound changes in circulatory physi- ology during pregnancy, hypertensive events mayoccur at lower-than-expected BPs. These patientsshould be assessed for pre-eclampsia. Renal Does the patient complain of hematuria? HTN can precipitate or exacerbate existing renal insufficiency or failure. Past medical In general, historical information should includethe age of the patient, known prior diagnosis ofHTN, cardiovascular or renal diseases, present orpast antihypertensive medications, compliancehistory with those medications, and known con-comitant medical conditions, such as diabetes.The patient should be specifically asked aboutthe use of drugs, such as monoamine oxidaseinhibitors, cocaine, amphetamines, and alcohol,and the abrupt discontinuation of antihyperten-sive drugs, such as clonidine or /H9252-blockers. The sudden withdrawal of clonidine and /H9252-blockers may result in catecholamine excess and rebound HTN.Primary Complaints 395Hypertensive urgencies and emergencies Physical examination Most hypertensive patients presenting to the ED are without distinguishing signs on physicalexamination. As with the history , it is important to look for manifestations of end-organ dysfunc- tion. This information will help determine if thepatient is having a hypertensive emergencyrequiring prompt treatment, or a hypertensive urgency requiring specific follow-up. Areas of the physical examination to address include all of the following: Vital signs The BP should be checked more than once whilethe patient is in the ED with an appropriately-sized cuff. A cuff that is too short will produce anerroneously high reading. Most BP devicesdepend on occluding the artery of an extremitywith an inflatable cuff, and measure BP either by oscillometry or detection of Korotkoff sounds.Oscillometric or automatic devices are subject to greater error than auscultating for Korotkoffsounds by manual pressure measurement. BPmeasurements (Table 26.1) can be different between arms. However, differences greater than 20 mmHg for systolic or 10 mmHg diastolic pres- sures raise concern for a vascular abnormalitythat should be further investigated. If autonomicinstability is suspected, the BP should be checkedin three positions - prone, upright sitting, and upright standing. BP measur ement from the patient with a gravid uterus should be obtained in the left lateral recumbent position. Otherwise,the BP reading can be erroneously low due tocompression of blood return from the inferiorvena cava by the gravid uterus. In addition to BPmeasurements, it is important to note whetherthe patient is tachypneic or hypoxic.Fundoscopic The retinae are examined for vascular changes, hemorrhages and exudates. The optic disc margins are examined for edema (Figure 26.1). Acute hypertensive changes include papilledema, hardexudates, and silver wiring. Neurologic The mental status examination should specif-ically address whether the patient is alert andaware. Alertness requires normal functioning ofthe reticular activating system. Awareness requiresalertness plus normal functioning of the cerebralhemispheres. Mental status changes may indicatehypertensive encephalopathy. Focal abnormalitiesof speech, cranial nerves, motor or sensory sys-tems, or reflexes may be the result of subarach-noid hemorrhage, stroke, or pre-eclampsia (in apregnant patient). Cardiovascular The focus of this examination is the identificationof pulse abnormalities and the presence of mur-murs and gallops. Diminished extremity pulsesmay be found in patients with coarctation of theaorta or aortic dissection. Patients with heart failuremay have dusky or pale skin, tachycardia, pulsus Figure 26.1 Hypertensive retinopathy.

Diagnostic testing The purpose of diagnostic testing of hypertensivepatients in the ED is to identify end organ dam-age and to determine the presence of concomitantdiseases or complications. Commonly utilizedtests include hematocrit, electrolytes, blood ureanitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), urine pregnancy test, electrocardiogram (ECG),and computerized tomography (CT) of the brain.

Laboratory studies Complete blood count The complete blood count (CBC), which includes the hematocrit, serves as a general measure of apatient's health. Anemia is found in a variety ofchronic diseases, including renal insufficiency dueto sustained elevations of BP . It is not requiredfor the diagnostic work-up. Electrolytes The primary electrolyte of interest is potassium. Abnormal potassium levels could indicatehyperaldosteronism, renovascular disease oradvanced renal insufficiency. This informationwould be helpful to the primary health careprovider and allows him or her to determine iffurther diagnostic tests are needed. Urinalysis The renal status of the patient is assessed by the presence of protein, blood, and glucose in theurine. Examination of urine sediment providesimportant information regarding renal parenchy-mal disease. Although BUN and Cr are insensi- tive markers of renal function, they do provide along-term marker of progressive decline. Glucosedetermination is also important in determiningthe potential for diabetes. The selection of anti-hypertensive therapy would be affected by thepresence of diabetes. Pregnancy test Women of childbearing age with HTN should have a pregnancy test completed if appropriate. This determines if further studies are needed andthe type of referral necessary. Toxicologic testing In any hypertensive patient in whom illicit drug use is suspected, toxicologic screening would beappropriate to clarify clinical management. Electrocardiogram The ECG identifies patients with left ventricu-lar hypertrophy that occurs with sustained ele-vations of BP . Specific criteria exist which demon-strate HTN by ECG voltage criteria. The most specific is an R wave in lead aVL /H1102211mm. In addition, patients with prior asymptomaticmyocardial infarctions and HTN should be iden-tified because of an increased risk of cardiovas-cular complications. Radiologic studies In patients with focal neurologic signs or symp-toms, a brain CT is required. This is not necessaryon all patients with elevated BP and headache.Clinical judgment and discretion is required. Achest CT is indicated for patients with sus- pected aortic dissection. This test can be substi-tuted for aortography or done in conjunctionwith it. Abdominal CT is recommended if AAAis suspected. In the proper hands, abdominalultrasound may be satisfactory, and can be per-formed more quickly and safely at the bedside. General treatment principles An asymptomatic, hypertensive patient present- ing to the ED does not require emergent treatment.There is no evidence to suggest that the acutereduction of BP in these patients reduces the complications of HTN. There is evidence, how-ever, that stroke, deterioration in renal function,and cardiac ischemia or infarction can occur as aresult of rapid, uncontrolled BP reduction. As a general guideline for treatment of HTN, a diuretic should be started as initial drug ther-apy, especially in the elderly, when there are noconcomitant medical conditions or a hypertensiveemergency. As an alternative, /H9252-blockers could be used if there are no contraindications (i.e.,bronchospasm, bradycardia, heart block, previoussensitivity to /H9252-blockers). Some patients with concomitant medical conditions have specifictreatment recommendations. These includeangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitorsin diabetics with proteinuria, ACE inhibitors ordiuretics in patients with heart failure, diureticsor calcium channel antagonists in patients withisolated systolic HTN, and /H9252-blockers or ACE inhibitors in patients with prior myocardialinfarction. Acute BP reduction is contraindicated for hypertensive urgencies. If a noncompliant patienthad been on an antihypertensive regimen, theprior therapy could be resumed. The dose of onemedication should be increased in a compliantpatient. Newly-diagnosed patients should bestarted on monotherapy. All of these need Primary Complaints 397Hypertensive urgencies and emergenciesTable 26.4 Pharmacologic agents in the treatment of hypertension emergenciesEmergency Drug(s) of choice Alternative drug(s) Acute to be reevaluated following the initiation of therapy and to makenecessary adjustments in therapy.

(continued )Primary Complaints 399Hypertensive urgencies and emergencies Special patients Pregnant HTN in pregnancy contributes significantly to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. In pregnancy, HTN is defined as a BP of140/90 mmHg or greater, or a 20 mmHg rise inthe systolic pressure or a 10 mmHg rise in the dias-tolic pr essure from baseline. The threshold for the diagnosis of HTN in pregnancy is thereforelower than in the nonpregnant patient. Thehypertensive emergencies of pregnancy and been antihypertensive drug ofchoice in hypertensive crises of pregnancy becauseit preserves uterine blood flow. Calcium channelantagonists and /H9252-blockers are effective, safe alter- natives. Magnesium sulfate is effective in reducingthe incidence of eclampsia in women with severepre-eclampsia. Delivery of the infant is the onlycure for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Pediatric HTN in children is uncommon. It is defined as asystolic or diastolic pressure greater than the 95thpercentile for age and sex. Generally, childrenwith significant HTN have underlying renal orrenovascular causes. These children should be referred to primary care pediatricians or pediatric nephrologists for further diagnostic evaluation. Disposition All patients with identified hypertensive emer-gencies must be admitted to an intensive care ortelemetry setting for appropriate monitoring.Patients with identified hypertensive urgenciesTable 26.4 Pharmacologic agents in the of hypertension emergencies ( cont) Agent Dose Comments Labetalol Initial dose 20 mg IV over 2 minutes; follow Contraindications include coronary or cerebral with 20-80 mg q10-15 minutes until BP arteriosclerosis, renal impairment, or controlled.

Patients with ele-vated BP in the ED and concomitant medicalconditions should have the presenting conditionsstabilized, with referral to primary care for follow-up within a few weeks for a BP recheck.Patients with elevated BP in the ED without con-comitant medical conditions should be referred to primary care for a BP recheck within onemonth, sooner if possible. Occasionally, patients present to the ED with a primary complaint of elevated BP that has beennoted on a screening examination. If no prior his-tory of HTN exists, the above guidelines forreferral should be followed. If a patient was treated in the past for HTN, appropriate drug therapycould be reinstated with primary care referralwithin a month. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Not all patients who present with elevatedBP require emergent treatment. Evidence ofacute end-organ damage defines ahypertensive emergency and the need forprompt, controlled therapy. Treat the patient,not the number. Patients with evolving ischemic strokesfrequently have elevated BP . A rapidreduction of BP may cause extension of neurologic damage due to decreased cerebralblood flow. Therefore, expedient lowering ofthe BP should be avoided. In addition, oraland sublingual medications that cannot betitrated should not be used. Patients with asymptomatic HTN can bemanaged as outpatients in a primary caresetting. Patients presenting with HTN and heartfailure should be treated for fluid overloadfirst, with precautions for cardiac ischemia orother cardiac events. Pregnant patients are considered hypertensive at lower absolute BPmeasurements than nonpregnant patients.Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia two post-partum patients.References 1.Braunwald E, Fauci A, Kasper D, Hauser S, Longo D, Jameson JL (ed.).

Accurate evaluation and treatment mayreduce the severity and duration of disability. Anatomic essentials In order to determine the cause of joint pain, onemust understand the underlying anatomy of thejoint (Figure 27.1). The sources of joint pain maybe classified into two major anatomic categories:articular structures (joint capsule and its contents)and periarticular structures (structures superficialto the joint capsule). Ajoint is the union of the ends of two or more bones. On each bony surface lies a cushion, thearticular cartilage, a compressible matrix of collagen fibers an d proteoglycans which serves to prevent bone-on-bone contact. Adherent along the margins of the articular cartilage is a synovialmembrane, which creates the synovial cavity. Thesynovial membrane also secretes high-viscositysynovial fluid, which fills the synovial cavity inorder to lubricate the joints and facilitate mobil-ity. A fibrous joint capsule encloses the synovialmembrane, thus creating the unit known as thejoint space. The joint is strengthened and supported by ligaments, which are bands of fibrous tissues con-necting bones or cartilages. Additional support is provided by tendons, which are cords of fibroustissue continuous with muscle fibers attachingmuscle to bone or cartilage. More than 150 sacs ofsynovial fluid, known as bursae, are situatedthroughout the body around joints where frictionoccurs. Examples include the olecranon bursabeneath the skin superficial to the olecranonprocess, and the bursa between theacromion and supraspinatus muscle. Avariety of maladies may lead to joint pain, and the pathophysiology behind this is frequentlythe result of disruption of the normal articular orperiarticular anatomy and physiology. Mechanicaltrauma may lead to imbalance of the anabolic and27 Joint pain Douglas W. Lowery, MDand Melissa J. Lamberson, MD Tendon BursaLigamentSynovial fluid Joint cartilage Figure 27.1 Joint anatomy.Joint pain 402 Primary Complaintscatabolic processes maintaining normal joint homeostasis. Inflammatory reactions may be trig-gered by various stimuli, including bacteria, crys-tals, trauma, or systemic inflammatory conditions.Inflammation of either the articular or periarticu-larstructures is associated with the movement of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) into the syn- ovial cavities, and a decrease in theviscosity of the synovial fluid. Lysosomal enzymesreleased from these PMNs attack the joint struc- tures, invoking a severe inflammatory response.Unlike cartilage, synovium is rich in pain recep-tors, so that even minor inflammation leads tosevere pain and disability. History The most important historical information toobtain in a patient with joint pain is that whichenables determination of whether the pain involvesthe entire joint capsule (articular) or the structuressurrounding the joint capsule (periarticular). If thepain is articular, the number and distribution of thejoints guide the differential diagnosis (Table 27.1). Where is the pain located? Articular pain is often described as a generalized sensation of joint pain because the inflammatoryprocess affects all parts of the joint. Periarticularpain, in contrast, is more readily localized to aspecific site of inflammation. When did the pain begin? Acute pain may be secondary to an injury, infec- tion or inflammatory process, or may be due to anacute exacerbation of a chr onic condition. Patients with chronic arthritic conditions will often providea history of recurrent acute episodes. What makes the pain worse? As synovial tissue is rich in stretch receptors, articular pain is often exacerbated by both activeand passive motion of the joint. It may even occurat rest, as is often seen in arthritic conditions (e.g., inflammatory or septic arthritis). Periarticularpain is usually exacerbated with active or passivemovement involving the affected muscles or ten-dons. It is commonly seen with overuse conditionsin which repetitive motion results in inflamma-tion of the involved tissues (e.g., shoulder bursitis/tendinitis in a baseball player). How many joints are involved? Periarticular disease, such as bursitis, tendinitis, and cellulitis, typically involves a single joint.Articular disease may be monoarticular or poly-articular. Examples of monoarticular arthritidesinclude septic and gouty arthritis. Polyarticulararthritis may be acute (e.g., viral arthritis, Lymedisease, or gonoccocemia) or chronic (e.g., systemiclupus erythematosus (SLE), psoriatic arthritis, ordermatomyositis); it may (RA), arth-ritis) or asymmetric (rubella, gonococcal arthritis, acute r heumatic fever). Which joints are involved? Certain arthritic conditions are often recognized by joint pain in distinctive locations. Osteoarthritiscommonly affects the proximal interphalangeal(PIP) and distal (MCP) and PIP jointsof the hand. Gout commonly affects the great toe metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint (known as podagra ), the ankle, and the knee. However, a patient may present with joint pain that mayactually be referred from a bony metastatic lesionin the setting of an underlying malignancy. Associated symptoms Eliciting other specific information will assist inmaking the right diagnosis in a patient with jointpain. A low-grade fever is not unusual withinflammatory conditions of the joint. However, thepresence of a high fever and chills must alert oneto the possibility of septic arthritis. Constitutionalsymptoms are also commonly seen not only inArticular joint painPrimary Complaints 403Joint paininfection but also in RA. Skin lesions should increase suspicion for a systemic or autoimmunedisease (e.g., track marks of intravenous drugabuse syndrome. Uric acid nephrolithi-asis may be associated with gouty arthritis. Past medical Obtaining information about the medical historymay yield additional clues to the etiology of joint pain. One must inquire about autoimmune disease, gout, other known arthritic conditions,hemophilia, and even malignancy. The medica-tion history may prove useful. Thiazide diureticsincrease uric may lead arthritis.Chronic arthritides have a familial predispos-ition, so inquiring about family history may behelpful. Social history is often a clue to making adefinitive diagnosis. Inquire about overuse activ-ities, sports, injection drug use, and sexual history.Just as important is a vocational history. Certainjoint conditions are characteristically associatedwith particular occupations due to distinct injuriesor repetitive stress (e.g., anterior cruciate ligament(ACL) tear in a football player or prepatellar bur-sitis in a housemaid). Tick bites may lead to Lymedisease in endemic areas. Physical examination Once a thorough history has been elicited, anappropriate physical examination is important in enabling practitioners to develop a differentialdiagnosis. The basic principles of physical examination of the musculoskeletal system areinspection, palpation, and range of motion. General appearance Patients with acute inflammatory or infectiousjoint conditions will present with varying degreesof pain and distress. However, an acutely ill ortoxic-appearing patient with joint pain likely hasa significant infection or an underlying systemiccondition that may or may not have been previ-ously diagnosed. Vital signs In the presence of a high fever, look for signs ofjoint infection. Other suggestive signs includetachycardia or possibly hypotension if there is asystemic infection. Inflammatory conditions morecommonly present with a low-grade or normaltemperature, and possibly mild tachycardia ortachypnea due to pain. Musculoskeletal Inspection Redness of the overlying skin is often associated with periarticular processes (e.g., cellulitis of theskin or bursitis/tendinitis from overuse or injury),and should alert providers to the possibility ofinfection of the underlying joint. This warrantsimmediate orthopedic evaluation. Swelling within the joint (an effusion), may be secondary to blood from an injury, purulencefrom infection, or excessive amounts of synovialfluid from synovitis. Such fluid is usually palpa-ble. However, fluid may also be periarticular, orig-inating from similar causes involving the tissuessurrounding the joint (e.g., prepatellar bursitis). Wounds may be superficial, indicating a minor injury, or may be contiguous with the joint spacenecessitating urgent orthopedic intervention toprevent or treat a potential infection. Other lesionsmay be pustular, indicating a potential systemicinfection such as gonococcemia (Figure 27.2). Muscle atrophy is evidence of disuse due to pain in the involved joint. Deformities frequently enable immediate diagnosis if they are fractures or dislocations, orare characteristic of specific conditions, such astophaceous lesions of gouty arthritis orHeberden's nodes of osteoarthritis. In chronic arthritic conditions, the distribu- tion of joint involvement may suggest a specificdiagnosis. For example, in osteoarthritis, there isa predilection for the first carpometacarpal joint,the first MTP joint, the DIP joints, and the knees,hips, cervical and lumbosacral spine. In contrast,RA affects the wrists, MP joints, PIP joints, andfeet. Symmetry of deformities on both sides of the body is typical of rheumatoid arthritis. Palpation Warmth suggests inflammation, and should be compared to the surrounding tissues or the oppos- itejoint. It may be due to arthritis, infection, or acute trauma. Tenderness often reveals the underlying path- ology if localized to a specific anatomic structure. Generalized tenderness may imply involvementof the entire joint.Swelling, particularly a joint effusion, may be palpable if not easily visualized as described above. Range of motion Range of motion varies from person to person, but no musculoskeletal examination is completewithout taking a joint through its full range of motion. Decreased range of motion may bepresent secondary to pain from inflammation,infection, or injury, even if no abnormalities arenoted on inspection or palpation. It may also beseen with increasing age.

Look for symmetry of range of motion. The presence of pain with range motion is not a specific finding, as it may be found with numerouspathologies involving the joint. It is usually morehelpful if it can be localized to a specific structure.Involvement of periarticular structures commonlyresults in pain only with active range of motion. Another maneuver to perform in assessing rangeof motion is pain with axial loading or weight-bearing, which is more likely to be seen witharthritic conditions or an injury to the joint. Head-to-toe In addition to a focused examination of the joint,a more thorough examination involving theremainder of the organ systems is required in the presence of other patient complaints, signs orsymptoms. A detailed examination will help iden-tify any evidence of underlying systemic disease which may not have initially been suspectedbased on the chief complaint of joint pain (e.g.,skin tightening in scleroderma or heart murmurof endocarditis) (Table 27.2).

Practitioners generallyorder a complete blood count (CBC) seeking anelevated white blood cell (WBC) count to confirman infectious disease or a decreased hemoglobinand hematocrit to suggest systemic rheumaticdisease. Another test is the erythrocyte sedimen-tation rate (ESR); elevations are seen in the con-text of systemic rheumatic diseases. However,these two commonly ordered tests do not demon-strate adequate sensitivity or specificity to assist in the differential diagnosis. Since septic arthritisis normally the result of hematogenous spread ofbacteria to joints, blood cultures may have someutility if this is being considered. If gonococcus(GC) is suspected as a pathogen in septic arthritis(particularly in younger patients), then culturesfor GC should be taken from the pharynx, urethra,rectum, cervix, and any skin pustules. In acute gout, serum uric acid levels are often normal. If the practitioner has suspicion for a systemic rheumatic disease, as would be the case for patients with polyarthritis of more than 6 weeks duration orwith an inflammatory synovial fluid, the followinglaboratory tests should be obtained to aid withdiagnosis: CBC, differential, antinuclear anti-body and antistreptinolysin O (ASO) titer. If the practitioner has suspicion for a viral infectious etiology, such as in polyarthritis of lessthan 6 weeks duration, the following laboratorytests should be obtained to aid with diagnosis:CBC, differential, liver function tests (to assessfor the presence of hepatitis), hepatitis B and Cserologies (if indicated by elevations of the liverfunction tests), and parvovirus serology. Additional serologies, such as Lyme titers, may be sent if indicated by the clinical picture. Inatraumatic hemarthrosis, consideration shouldbe given to a workup for hemophilia with pro- time, partial thrombo plastin time, platelet count, and bleeding time. Synovial fluid analysis The most useful diagnostic test for patients withacute joint pain is often synovial fluid analysis.Aspiration and examination of synovial fluid isindicated for patients with joint effusion and/orsigns of inflammation. Arthrocentesis is a proced-urethat involves the puncture and aspiration of synovial fluid from a joint space. Careful aseptictechnique must be ensured, and the procedure iscontraindicated if there is suspicion or evidenceof infection overlying the arthrocentesis land-marks. Typically, synovial fluid analysis includescell count and differential, Gram's stain and cul-ture, and crystal analysis. Glucose analysis andviscosity may be obtained as well, but are lessdiagnostic. Synovial fluid should be collected inethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes(lavender top) for cell count and differential,heparin tubes (green top) for crystal analysis, andstandard tubes (red top) for chemistries, serolo-gies, and viscosity. Cultures should be plated assoon as possible after aspiration, especially if GCis suspected as a pathogen. A positive Gram's stainis diagnostic for septic arthritis, but a negativeGram's stain does not rule out septic arthritis.Crystal analysis is performed using polarizingPrimary Complaints 409Joint pain microscopy, with monosodium urate crystals in appearing 2-10 needle-shapedcrystals which are negatively birefringent. In con-trast, calcium in pseudo- gout appear as polymorphic (often rhomboid)positively birefringent crystals. High white cellcounts are suggestive, but not diagnostic, of infec-tious etiologies. A low white cell count does not rule out a septic etiology. One must therefore use caution in interpreting these results, as overlapexists between these categories. Synovial fluidcell count may be estimated on a wet mountpreparation: two or fewer WBCs per high-powerfield (hpf) is suggestive of a non-inflammatoryeffusion, while more than 20 WBC/hpf indicatessevere inflammation or infection (Table 27.4). Electrocardiography Electrocardiography (ECG) is indicated inpatients with clinical symptoms suggestive ofcardiac involvement, including chest pain, palpi-tations, or shortness of breath. Acute rheumaticfever may cause carditis, which leads to prolonga-tion of the P-R interval, and pericarditis, which leads to diffuse S-T segment changes and short-ening of the P-R interval. Both of these diagnosesare part of the Jones criteria for the diagnosis ofacute rheumatic fever (Table 27.5). This requiresthe presence of either two major criteria, or onemajor and two minor criteria, in the presence ofsupporting evidence of prior Group A strepto-coccal infection. Supporting evidence of priorGroup A streptococcal infection includes recentscarlet fever, positive rapid streptococcal test orbacterial throat culture, or increasing or elevatedstreptococcal antibody titer.

In the acute setting, X-rays should be reserved for patients with a history of significant trauma or bony point ten-derness. In the patient with acute arthritis, themost likely finding is soft tissue swelling, so radiographs cannot be used to rule in or rule outacute septic arthritis. Images should be reviewedfor evidence of fracture, neoplasm, osteomyelitis,avascular necrosis (including Legg-Calv\u00e9- Perthesdisease), slipped capital femoral other bone disease. In case of cellulitis, carefulexamination of the soft tissues should be per-formed to rule out foreign body. As early as oneweek after the onset of septic arthritis, radiographsmay show loss of joint space, subchondral bonedestruction, and periosteal new bone formation. General treatment principles As with all emergency patients, treatment begins with the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs).The main goals of treatment are physiologic sta-bilization, symptom relief, proper utilization ofdiagnostic tests, and appropriate referral. Pain relief Given the severity of pain associated with acutesynovitis of any etiology, rapid and effective painrelief is crucial in the treatment of joint pain. Patients may require parenteral opioid analgesics,such as morphine or meperidine, to manage theirpain. Adding antiemetics to this regimen decreasesthe nausea and vomiting that often accompany theadministration of these agents. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as parenteralketorolac or oral ibuprofen, may also be effective inreducing the pain of acute synovitis. In osteoarthri- tis and RA, acetaminophen has been repeatedlydemonstrated to improve pain at recommendeddosages. Salicylates have been effective in relievingpain from acute rheumatic fever and RA. In crystal arthropathies, acute synovitis is often treated with a combination of NSAIDs(indomethacin has been a favorite for gout) andcolchicine, a microtubule inhibitor that reducesinflammation in the synovium. Colchicine notas effective for pseudogout as for gout, but maystill prove a useful adjunct. Caution is needed inelderly patients, or those with renal or hepaticdisease. In resistant cases, a prednisone taper orintramuscular adrenocorticotrophic hormone(ACTH) may prove useful. ACTH may also beused in patients who cannot receive NSAIDs.Uric acid lowering agents, such as allopurinol,have no role in the acute management of goutyarthritis. Immobilization Simple splinting of the affected joints often signifi-cantly reduces the pain of synovitis, since the syn-ovial receptors are exquisitely sensitive to stretch.However, once the pain has been controlled phar-macologically, patients should be encouraged toremove splints and begin range of motion exer- cises to avoid loss of function and muscle atrophythat occurs with prolonged splinting. Antibiotics Outcomes after septic arthritis, the most seriouscause of acute joint pain, are improved withrapid diagnosis and rapid administration ofintravenous antibiotics. Specific antibiotic selec-tion should be made with regard to the likelymicrobial pathogens. It should always includevigorous coverage for Staphylococcus species,given their frequency of occurrence. Ceftriaxoneworks well against Neisseria gonorrhoeae . For early Lyme disease, patients should 20-30 days of oral doxycycline, amoxicillin,or cefuroxime. Erythromycin is lesseffective. More severe disease requires intra-venous penicillin or ceftriaxone at high doses forseveral weeks. Acute rheumatic fever is besttreated with benzathine penicillin G intramuscu-larly, or oral penicillin V for 10 days. Drainage Patients with septic or gonococcal arthritisrequire drainage of the affected joints. In the case of bacterial arthritis, this may best be accom-plished in the operating room by open incisionand drainage, especially if a large joint, such asthe knee or hip is involved. For smaller joints orin the case of gonococcal arthritis, repeated dailyaspirations with a large bore needle or arthro-scope may be recommended. This therapeuticdecision should be made in concert with theorthopedic consultant managing the patient. If thepatient has osteomyelitis, a joint prosthesis, or isresistant to conservative therapy, open incision and drainage in the operating room should beperformed.Primary Complaints 411Joint pain Special patients Pediatric Septic arthritis in the pediatric population is the result of hematogenous spread from another site, or the result of direct invasion from an area ofosteomyelitis prior to growth plate closure. Thus,the clinician must maintain a high degree of sus-picion for this diagnosis in febrile children withany joint complaints, even in the presence of aremote source of fever. The diagnosis of septic arthritis in infants is particulary challenging, asinfants often present only with irritability andpossibly fever. Only the most astute clinicians andparents are likely to notice a decrease in mobilityof an extremity in this age group. Staphylococcus aureus remains an important etiologic agent across all age ranges. Neonates are at increased risk forEscherichia coli and Group B In vaccin- ation has reduced the incidence of H. influenzae by more than 95%. Pneumococcus and S. aureus are the most likely organisms throughout the remain-der of the pediatric age group, with N. gonorrhoeae becoming more common during adolescence. In children, additional consideration must also begiven to conditions like SCFE, osteomyelitis, orLegg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease (avascular necrosisof the femoral head) that often present with apainful joint. Elderly Older adults differ in several ways from the popu-lation as a whole with respect to joint pain. First, geriatric patients have a higher incidence ofchronic arthritides, which in themselves may flarecausing acute joint pain. It is also difficult to inter-pret acute illness in the setting of chronic jointchanges. Additionally, older patients have a higherincidence of septic arthritis. Despite the severity ofthis condition, they frequently lack the classic symptoms and signs, making the diagnosis moredifficult. Immune compromised Injection drug users, with or without humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, comprisean increasing proportion of patients presentingwith septic arthritis. Typically, septic arthritis inthe injection drug user afflicts joints of the axialskeleton more often than the peripheral skeleton.The most common organisms are Pseudomonas Oncology and transplant patients have a higher rate of septic arthritis as well as iatro-genic (drug-associated) gouty arthritis. In thesegroups, great attention must be given to com-plaints of joint pain, as the clinical signs of acuteinflammation are often mild or absent despitethe presence of significant infection. In additionto considering a broader spectrum of bacterialpathogens in these patients, synovial fluid cul-tures should include evaluation for fungi andmycobacteria. Finally, patients with chr onic arthritis, especially RA and crystal arthritis, maybe taking immunosuppressive medications,which increases their risk for septic arthritis. Disposition Patients in whom septic arthritis is suspected,ruled in, or cannot be excluded require ortho- pedic consultation and admission for intravenousantibiotics pending culture results. Assuming anon-infectious etiology for joint pain can beestablished, patients can be discharged if their painis adequately controlled. If this is not possible,admission for parenteral analgesics may be nec-essary. V isiting home nursing, assisted living, or skilled nursing care may be required if an episodeof acute arthritis leaves a patient unable to per-form activities of daily living or increases theirrisk for falls. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths In patients with monoarticular arthritis,septic arthritis should be presumed untilproven otherwise, especially if these patientshave systemic signs of toxicity. T he number of joints involved and their distribution are significant clues to thedifferential diagnosis. Patients with a single painful joint require adetailed physical examination to rule outevidence of systemic disease. Never perform arthrocentesis through anarea of cellulitis or infection. Use caution when interpreting the white cellcount of synovial fluid analysis, as overlapexists between etiologies. Do not underestimate or undertreat paincaused by synovitis.Joint pain 412 Primary ComplaintsReferences 1.American College of Rheumatology Ad Hoc Committee on Clinical Guidelines.Guidelines for the initial evaluation of theadult patient with acute musculoskeletalsymptoms.

It is one ofthe most expensive outpatient diseases in medi-cine and is generally a recurrent problem. Mostpatients have no serious underlying disease andare termed \"uncomplicated.\" A few patients willhave very serious disease necessitating emergentintervention. The process of identifying those withserious disease from the vast majority of patientswith uncomplicated back pain can be difficult. Anatomic essentials Acute low back pain refers to pain felt in the lumbosacral spine and paraspinal areas. The pain may originate from lumbosacral structures such as bones (lumbar vertebrae, sacrum and coccyx),intervertebral discs, joints (facet, sacroiliac), softtissues (muscles, tendons, ligaments), vascularstructures, and nervous tissue (spinal cord, nerveroots). Low back pain may also be referred from pelvic, retroperitoneal, and abdominal structuresdue to shared innervation. The spinal cord is housed in the spinal column, a series of interconnected bones held in place bycomplex ligamentous and muscular structures.The spinal cord is surrounded by the dura mater and a series of potential spaces. These spaces areimportant to clinicians because inf ection and tumor can seed there. The adult spinal cord endsat approximately the L1-L2 junction. The nerveroots at the end of the spinal cord are known as the cauda equina (horse's tail). Pressure on the cauda equina can result in bladder and bowelincontinence and saddle anesthesia (decreasedsensation over the buttocks, perineum, and medial each vertebral body lie the shock- absorbing interverterbral discs composed of the nucleus pulposus and surrounding annulusfibrosus. Lateral herniation of the lumbar discs can produce classic sciatica (lateralizing legpain). Very rarely, central herniation of a disc ator above L1 can produce a cord compression syndrome. The spinal nerves exit the spinal column between the vertebral bodies. Compression ofthese spinal nerves can lead to radicular pain,motor and/or sensory loss. Understanding thelumbar dermatomes and myotomes is importantfor following the progression or resolution ofneurologic symptoms, as well as effective medicaldocumentation (Table 28.1).28 Low back pain Mel Herbert, MD, MBBS , BMEDSCI and Mary Lanctot-Herbert, MSN, calf Dorsiflexors foot First web Medial and foot /H11006 great toe Cauda equina Multiple Saddle anesthesia* Multiple, including Any or all of the above (massive central Any or all of the above, any or all of the above Anal wink anterior usually bilaterally Bladder/bowel Cremasteric prolapse) dysfunction *Saddle area is that part of the buttocks that sits on a traditional bicycle.History The overlying concern in the assessment of patients with low back pain is to rule out seriouscauses (Figure 28.1). Identifying patients with\"red flags\" on history or physical examinationshould raise the clinician's suspicion and guidethe diagnostic evaluation (Tables 28.2 and 28.3). How long have you had the pain? \"Acute\" low back pain refers to pain lasting less than 2-4 weeks, while \"chronic\" low back painhas typically lasted more than 12 weeks. Ask thepatient about previous episodes and whether ornot these episodes were similar.

Reproduced from Della-Giustina, 2000.Where is the pain? Does it radiate? Pain localized to the paralumbar musculature without dermatomal radiation most likely repre-sents muscular or ligamentous strain. Radiation ofpain in a dermatomal distribution implies nerveroot compression. Pain radiating to both legs can be seen with cauda equina syndrome. Pain radiat-ing to the groin may be seen with abdominal aor-tic aneurysm (AAA) or renal calculi. Pain radiatingto the abdomen should raise suspicion for a pos-sible visceral cause or sacroiliac disease. How would you describe the pain? Deep somatic pain from structures such as the muscles, tendons, and ligaments is often describedas a deep, dull ache. Sciatica is often described asa sharp or burning pain radiating down the pos-terior or lateral aspect of the leg. The pain associ-ated with a ruptured AAA is often acute, severeand constant. How did the pain begin (sudden versus chronic)? Did you sustain trauma? The sudden onset of pain suggests disc prolapse,crush fracture, or ruptured AAA, while the grad-ual onset of pain over years suggests degenera-tive disease. Pain onset over days to weeks is notreliable in distinguishing the cause. Major trauma, such as motor vehicle collisions or falls fromheight, as well as minor trauma, such as strenu-ous lifting in a potentially osteoporotic patient,should raise concern for vertebral fractures. What makes the pain better or worse? Mechanical (uncomplicated) back pain improves with rest and is exacerbated by movement andstanding. Radicular pain (nerve root compression)is worse with coughing, sneezing, or changingpositions. Constant pain not generally altered byrest or position is worrisome for a serious cause, such as cancer or a spinal infection. Similarly,unrelenting pain despite adequate analgesiaraises concern for serious disease. Pain that is worse at night is worrisome for malignancy, infection, or ankylosing spondylitis.Morning stiffness and pain that improves withexercise suggests an inflammatory arthritis, whilepain worsening over the course of the day suggestsosteoarthritis. Lower extremity pain exacerbatedby walking and relieved by sitting (neurogenicclaudication) may be due to spinal stenosis.Have you had any weakness, numbness, orloss of control of your bowel or bladder? The presence of numbness or weakness suggests nerve root compression or spinal cord involve-ment. Bladder dysfunction or fecal incontinencein association with low back pain is a very ser-ious symptom, suggesting cauda equina syndromeor higher spinal cord compression. Ask the patientabout symptoms of urinary retention, increasedfrequency, or overflow incontinence. Do you have a history of cancer or injection drug use? The most powerful predictor of cancer as a cause of back pain is a prior or current history of cancer(especially breast, lung, and prostate cancers).Metastatic tumors of the vertebrae are 25 timesmore common than primary tumors, such asmultiple myeloma. Metastases to the spinal col-umn and cord may also result in epidural cordcompression. Injection drug use places patients at very high risk of spinal infections, such as osteomyelitis,discitis, or epidural abscess. Other patients atincreased risk include those with diabetes, chronicrenal failure, alcoholism, or recent spinal surgery. Some authorities recommend that these patientsbe promptly and aggressively evaluated for spinalinfections. Failure to rapidly diagnose an expand-ing epidural abscess can result in permanent neu-rologic deficit. Associated symptoms The presence of fevers, chills, night sweats, orunexplained weight loss in patients with back painsuggests malignancy or infection. Urinary tract,pulmonary or gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms mayidentify a referred cause for low back pain. Past medical Aprevious history of back surgery or back prob- lems should be elicited. A history of an aneurysmor aortic graft repair raises concern for a leakingAAA. A previous history of or risk factors forosteoporosis (female, age over 50, steroid use) maypredispose the patient to fractures. The dates ofthe last menstrual period and the possibility ofpregnancy should be ascertained, as a normal or ectopic pregnancy can cause low back pain. Details regarding the patient's profession, pending litigation, or workman's compensation Primary Complaints 415Low back painLow back pain 416 Primary Complaintsstatus are important if the injury occurred on the job. A family history of inflammatory arthritissuch as ankylosing spondylitis could suggest apotential etiology. The use of medications, such as corticosteroids, is a risk factor for spinal infections and frac-tures due to osteoporosis. Over-anticoagulation orthrombocytopenia may place the patient at riskfor especially followingtrauma, lumbar puncture (LP), epidural or spinal surgery. Spontaneous retroperitonealhemorrhage in patients on warfarin or with bleed-ingdisorders may present with low back pain. Physical examination The physical examination of the patient with backpain is focused and intended to select patientswith possible serious etiologies. General appearance Cachectic patients are at risk for spinal infectionsfrom being immunocompromised and vertebralfractures from osteoporosis. Consider whether theunderlying cause of cachexia is from injection drug use, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),or an underlying cancer that has metastasized tothe spine. Vital signs Fever suggests an infectious cause of back pain,with the rectal temperature being most sensitive.Many patients with spinal infections do not have a fever. Patients with AAA, sepsis, or ruptured ectopic pregnancy may present with hypotension.This finding may be transient and lead to syncopeas a presenting complaint. Abdomen Gently palpate the abdomen for a pulsatile massthat may be present in 50% of patients with anAAA. Also note any abdominal tenderness orfindings that suggest a visceral etiology (e.g.,appendicitis or ectopic pregnancy) with painreferred to the back or flank. For low back pain referred to the groin or buttocks, the hips should be assessed for pain and range of motion (ROM). Back Examination of the back includes inspection, pal-pation, and assessment of active ROM. The patientshould be assessed for abnormal posture, spinalcontour, or pelvic tilt. Such abnormalities may bestructural or in response to pain or weakness. Theskin overlying the back should be examined forbruising, swelling, or other lesions such as herpeszoster, which can cause lateralized back pain. The lumbar paravertebral muscles should be palpated tenderness eachspinal vertebral process and sacroiliac joint toidentify areas of localized tenderness. Midlinebony percussion tenderness is unusual in patientswith uncomplicated back pain, and suggests afocal lesion such as a fracture, cancer, or infection.Pain on percussion of the costovertebral anglessuggests the presence of kidney pathology such aspyelonephritis. Active ROM is assessed and described by having the patient flex, extend and bend laterallyto each side. Normal ROM is 90\u00b0 flexion, 15\u00b0extension, and 45\u00b0 lateral flexion. Rectal This part of the examination should generally be done with a chaperone. Examine for perianaland saddle sensation by asking the patient \"Doesthe skin in this region feel normal or numb?\"Check the rectal tone by having the patient vol-untarily contract their anal sphincter after insert-ing your gloved and lubricated finger. Saddleanesthesia and abnormal sphincter tone suggesta serious cause of back pain, such as cauda equinasyndrome. Neurologic The legs should be evaluated for sensorychanges in a dermatomal distribution by com-paring one side to the other (Figure 28.2). In thesame way, motor deficits should be sought in asystematic manner, generally starting at the toesand moving to the hips. Each side should becompared against the other. Evidence of majormotor weakness is suggested by abnormalities ofknee extension (quadriceps weakness), ankleplantar flexion and eversion, and dorsiflexion(footdrop). Documentation is best done withdescriptive words rather than any of the varietyof scoring systems. For example: \"Left great toedorsiflexion with mild compared left great toe.\" Muscle atrophy can be detected by comparing the circumference of thethighs or calves.Primary Complaints 417Low back painCheck for abnormalities of the ankle reflex (tests predominantly the S1 nerve root), and the knee reflex (tests predominantly the L4 nerve root). As reflexes may diminish with age, it is critical to identify asymmetry. The pr esence of clonus, hyperreflexia, or upgoing toes inresponse to plantar stimulation indicates an upper motor neuron lesion, such as spinal cordcompression. Gait is an extremely important part of the exam- ination. Check for difficulty with heel walking(ankle and toe dorsiflexors innervated by the L5and some L4 nerve roots) or toe walking (calfmuscles, mostly the S1 nerve root). Inability to walkdespite adequate analgesia may suggest seriouspathology. This also may assist with disposition, asa patient who cannot walk should not be dis-charged from the emergency department (ED),unless this situation is chronic and unchanged.

The SLR test detects tension on the L5 and/or S1 nerve root. The SLR test reproduces posterior or posterolat-eral leg pain by stretching nerve roots irritatedby disc herniation. Pain felt below the knee at less than 70\u00b0 of straight leg elevation, aggra vated bydorsiflexion of the ankle and relieved by ankleplantar flexion or external limb rotation is highlysuggestive of tension on the L5 or S1 nerve rootfrom disc herniation. The reproduction of backpain with SLR testing does not indicate signifi-cant nerve root tension. Figure 28.3 Straight leg raise (SLR) test. Figure 28.4 Sitting knee extension test (SKET).SKET instructions include:With the patient sitting on a table,both hip and knees flexed at 90\u00b0,slowly extend the knee as ifevaluating the patella or bottom of the foot. This maneuver stretchesnerve roots as much as a moderatedegree of supine SLR.SLR instructions include: (1)Have the patient lie as straight aspossible on a table in the supineposition. With one hand placedabove the knee of the leg beingexamined, exert enough firm pressure to keep the knee fullyextended. Ask the patient to relax. (2) With the other handcupped under the heel, slowlyraise the straight limb. Tell the patient, \"If this bothers you, letme know, and I will stop.\" (3)Monitor for any movement of thepelvis before complaints sciatic tensionshould elicit are (4)Estimate the of legelevation that elicits complaintfrom the patient. Then determinethe most distal area ofdiscomfort: back, hip, thigh, knee,or below the knee. (5) Whileholding the leg at the limit ofstraight leg raising, dorsiflex theankle. Note whether thisaggravates the pain. Internalrotation of the limb can alsoincrease the tension on thesciatic nerve roots.Primary Complaints 419Low back painThe crossed straight leg raise (CSLR) test is positive if an SLR test of an opposite (asympto- matic) limb elicits sciatic pain in the symptomaticlimb. A positive CSLR is a stronger indication ofnerve root compression due to disc herniation thanpain elicited from SLR testing in the ipsilateralleg. The reverse straight leg raise (RSLR) test orfemoral tension sign detects tension in the L2-L4nerve roots. With the patient prone, pain elicitedin the anterior thigh with extension of the hip orflexion of the knee confirms a positive RSLR test. The sitting knee extension test (SKET) also tests sciatic nerve root tension (Figure 28.4). The patientwith significant nerve root irritation tends to com-plain or lean backward to reduce tension on the nerve. Skin Search for signs of peripheral vascular disease(skin or hair loss over the toes or distal lowerextremities, ulcers, absent or weak distal pulses,or the presence of vascular grafts). These find-ings suggest searching for AAA. The skin shouldalso be screened for lesions suspicious for mali-gnancy, infection, or needle marks. Cancer screening As a general screen for cancer, examine theprostate in men, noting if it is hard or irregular. In women, examine the breast for lumps or skin findings that may be associated with cancer. Breast cancer affects women of allages. Examine for lymphadenopathy as a sign of HIVdisease, lymphoma, leukemia, or metastatic cancer. Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of low back pain (LBP) isbroad, but the classic mistake is to label LBP asbenign (i.e., muscular strain) when a serious causeis present (Tables 28.4 and 28.5). Renal colic is themost common incorrect diagnosis given to patientsultimately found to have AAA.

Test ordering shouldbe targeted and based on the results of a focusedhistory and physical examination. The overridingconcept is to aggressively image patients whohave historical or physical exam \"red flags,\" whilearranging follow-up for all other patients. Post-void residual Apost-void residual should be checked in any patient with urinary retention or incontinence. Thiscan be accomplished through urinary catheteriza-tion or non-invasive ultrasound. A residual vol-ume greater than 100 ml is reason for concern. Laboratory studies The routine use of the complete blood count(CBC) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)as screening tools is without merit. Numerousstudies note that these tests lack both sensitivityand specificity when applied to the back painpopulation. The ESR may be elevated in patientswith malignancy, inflammatory conditions, orinfection. Aurinalysis can screen for pyuria or hematuria. Aurine pregnancy test can exclude pregnancy prior to radiography or as a potential etiology oflow back pain (i.e., ectopic pregnancy). Radiologic studies Though plain lumbosacral spine radiographs maybe a useful screening tool for vertebral fractures(Figure 28.5) and spondylolisthesis (may occur inathletes involved in hyperextension sports likegolf or gymnastics), it is important to recognizetheir limitations. Lumbosacral plain films cannotdiagnose herniated intervertebral discs or spinalstenosis, and are frequently negative in patientswith cancer and spinal infections. Routine use oflumbar spine films to diagnose serious causes oflow back pain is a wasteful exercise. In fact, radi-ation exposure and incorrect imaging sensitivity may preclude more advanced appropriate imagingstudies, and therefore may be potentially harm-ful. In one study, plain lumbosacral radiographsrevealed unexpected findings in only 0.04% of patients under the age of 50. A complete lum-bosacral plain film series yields nearly 2000 timesthe gonadal radiation as a single chest X-ray(CXR).Emergent computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are indicatedin patients with a history, physical examination,or prior tests that strongly suggest a seriouscause for back pain. These include cauda equinasyndrome, AAA (Figure 28.6), infection, or tumor.Non-contrast CT is indicated when bony abnor-malities (i.e., fracture, degenerative changes) aresuspected, or when MRI is contraindicated. Radi-ologists favor MRI for suspected radiculopathycompared with CT, as it provides better resolution,no ionizing radiation, and superior ability to diag-nose other inflammatory, malignant, or vascularconditions (Figure 28.7). For patients with sciat-ica likely due to a herniated disc or spinal stenosis,and who lack major neurologic abnormalities, Figure 28.5 Lumbar compression fracture. Lateral radiograph of thelumbar spine demonstrating a compression fracture ofthe L4 with probable retropulsion of back pain 422 Primary Complaintsimaging can be deferred 4-8 weeks as the major- ity of these patients improve with conservativetherapy. The clinical significance of any abnormalities detected on imaging studies must be carefullyinterpreted in the context of the patient's pre-senting symptoms. It is well known that plainfilms, CT and MRI may reveal abnormalities suchas lumbar disc spondylosis (osteo-phytes), (anteriordisplacement of the vertebra) in asymptomaticpatients. This is especially true in older subjects. General treatment principles In the majority of patients without red flags, the principles of therapy include analgesia and returnto normal activity as quickly as possible, withlifting modifications and instructions on correct Figure 28.6 Non-contrast CT of ruptured AAA. Note high attenuationleft peri-aortic hemorrhage MRI (post-gadolinium) (see arrow). Courtesy :Mahesh Jayaraman, MD.posture, lifting techniques, and simple exercises. Table 28.6 provides initial treatment recommen- dations for several serious causes of LBP . Analgesia Analgesia should be adequate to allow patientsto comfortably return to normal activity as quicklyas possible. Analgesia should be given on atimed interval initially, then on an \"as required\"basis as the pain resolves. Hydrocodone/acet-aminophen combinations are commonly used andgenerally effective: one or two tablets of 5/500strength every 4 hours for short courses may beeffective. For mild pain, acetaminophen alone indoses of 15 mg/kg is an excellent medication.Tylenol with codeine is generally a poor choice, since it has many GI side effects and little ef ficacy over acetaminophen alone. anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen do not offer any particular advan-tage. However, doses of 400-600 mg every 6 hoursof ibuprofen may provide some relief. Any pre-scription for NSAIDs should be for short courses,because GI ulceration and hemorrhage is anincreasingly recognized side effect (especially inthe elderly), even after relatively short exposure. Muscle relaxants There is no doubt that many patients with uncom-plicated back pain have muscle spasm. However,there is controversy as to the effectiveness ofmuscle r elaxants. While diazepam at doses of 2-10 mg every 4-6 hours may be effective, many other choices exist. The addictive potential of diazepam, other muscle relaxants, and narcotics is real, but when used for acute pain and for short durations, the risk of addiction is small. Steroids Although corticosteroids are prescribed forpatients with low back pain (especially withradiculopathy), evidence supporting their use islacking. Other therapies Early ambulation and avoidance of activities thatprovoke pain should be encouraged. Patientsshould avoid prolonged sitting or standing andshould get up at regular intervals to walk andmove their backs. Bed rest should be limited toperiods of severe pain, and never for more than afew days at a time. Evidence recommending routine heat or cold therapy, physical therapy, or chiropractic manipu-lation is lacking. Since most episodes of acute low back pain resolve in 2-4 weeks, these therapiesare best reserved for patients not responding toinitial conservative management. Prevention Back exercises during the acute phase should beavoided, as they may exacerbate symptoms.

Additional work-up needed magnetic resonance imaging.Table 28.6 Diagnosis and treatment of serious causes of low back painLow back pain 424 Primary ComplaintsHowever, education on specific back strengthen- ing exercises and proper lifting techniques mayreduce subsequent episodes of pain or injury. In general, the best prevention is the maintenance ofan appropriate body mass index (i.e., weight lossfor most patients), exercise promoting cardiovas-cular fitness (without specific back exercises), andsmoking cessation (this probably does not reduceback pain episodes substantially but is good foroverall health and reduces the risk for lung can-cer). Abdominal core muscle strengthening ishelpful in minimizing low back pain as well. Special patients Elderly Back pain at the extremes of age should alwayscause concern. Elderly patients with back pain canharbor multiple pathologies, including AAA andcancer. The most immediately life-threateningcondition is AAA. Cancer in this age group is fre-quently a subsequent diagnosis in a patient whoinitially presents without an obvious mechanismof injury. Pediatric In children, controversy exists about the serious-ness of acute low back pain. Some authors note it isa rare complaint, suggesting significant pathology,while others have demonstrated the opposite. Sus-pect serious pathology when children complainof nocturnal pain or limit their activity secondaryto pain. All children who remain undiagnosedfollowing their ED visit need close follow-up andreevaluation. Athletes Athletes of all ages involved in hyperextensionsports (e.g., baseball pitchers, golfers, gymnasts)can develop pars interarticularis fractures andsubsequent spondylolisthesis. These injuries aremore likely found in those involved at the com-petitive level. In this case, referral to an orthoped-ist or neurosurgeon is recommended. Pregnancy Back pain in pregnancy is an extremely commoncomplaint. There are many potential causes ofback pain in pregnancy, resulting from changesin maternal weight, center of gravity, posture,and ligamentous stability. While pregnant patientsare not immune from serious causes of low backpain, it is generally true that most pain resolvesfollowing delivery. Due to the potential effects ofionizing radiation and medications on the grow- ing fetus, additional consideration should be givenprior to diagnostic imaging or therapy in thesepatients. Malingering The patient who embellishes medical history, exag-gerates pain, or provides inconsistent responses on physical examination can be partic ularly chal- lenging. \"Pain behaviors\" such distorted gait or posture, moaning, andrubbing of painful body parts may cloud medical issues and evoke responses from the clinician. Rather than interpreting these inconsistencies orpain behaviors as malingering, the clinician shouldview them as a plea for help or an attempt toenlist the practitioner as an advocate. In patientswith recurrent back problems, these behaviors andinconsistencies may simply be habits learned dur-ing previous medical evaluations. In working withthese patients, the clinician should attempt toidentify psychologic or socioeconomic pressures that might influence the presenta tion. The overall goal should always be to facilitate the patient's recovery and return to work or normal activities, without the development of chronic low backdisability. Disposition Patients with uncomplicated back pain can gener-ally be discharged home. Patients with severe painor social circumstances that make self-care diffi-cult may require a short hospital or skilled nursingfacility stay until pain is controlled. Dischargeinstructions should include encouragement toreturn to usual activites and the appropriate use of analgesia. Serious or worsening symptoms(fever, progressive unremitting pain, loss of bowelor bladder function, and progressive impairmentof neurologic function such as sensory loss thatexpands or motor weakness that progresses up ordown nerve roots) should prompt a return visit. Patients with serious etiologies of their back pain should be admitted to the appropriate inpa-tient service with rapid consultation. AAA is avascular emergency; the vascular surgeon shouldbe called as soon as the diagnosis is suspected.Cauda equina syndrome, other spinal cord syn-dromes, and spinal infections require immediatePrimary Complaints 425Low back painneurosurgical consultation and admission. While some lumbar spine fractures are stable, it is gener-allysafest to have an orthopedic or neurosurgical consultant assist with treatment and disposition. Cancer is a serious cause of back pain, although not all cancer patients require admission. Cancer patients who are candidates for discharge includethose without evidence of neurologic involve-ment, whose pain is controlled, and for whom rapid outpatient follow-up can be obtained. This plan, of course, assumes that an appropriate con-sultation has been arranged to follow the patientand expedite further evaluation. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Perhaps the most common pitfall in caring forback pain patients is the failure to recognize thesmall portion of patients with serious disease. Thefrequency with which these patients are seen andthe relatively infrequent serious pathology iden-tified can create a false sense of security for clini-cians and make them less thorough than isappropriate. Another common problem for emergency practitioners is to view back pain patients as drug-seeking. While there may be a small number ofpatients with back pain complaints whose trueobjective is to obtain narcotic analgesia, it is likelya small percentage. Making this assumption canbe dangerous. Indeed, a patient with a narcoticproblem that prompts him or her to seek emer-gency care for back pain may also be at high riskfor serious conditions, like an epidural abscess.The best approach is to rapidly relieve pain, searchfor reversible disease, and make multidisciplinaryreferrals if questions about narcotic abuse exist.

Saunders, 2001.Primary Complaints 427Pelvic pain Scope of the problem Pelvic pain is a common emergency department (ED) condition, and is the second most common gynecologic complaint. The pain may be acute or chronic, vague or defined, and occasionallyreferred to other parts of the body. Etiologies of pelvic pain may be reproductive, gastrointestinal(GI), vascular or urinary. Though specific causesof pelvic pain often do not require emergentdiagnosis or treatment, other diagnoses may posea threat to life (e.g., ectopic pregnancy) or mayhave serious reproductive sequelae, such asinfertility (e.g., salpingitis). Anatomic essentials Pelvic pain may originate from the reproductiveorgans (uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries) or localorgans, such as ureters, bladder,sigmoid colon or rectum (Figure 29.1). Visceral pelvic pain is usually caused by disten- tion of hollow organs by fluid or gas, or capsular stretching of solid organs secondary to edema,blood, cysts or abscesses. Less commonly it iscaused by ischemia or inflammation. It is oftenthe earliest manifestation of a particular diseaseprocess. The discomfort is often poorly character-ized and hard to localize, varying from a steadyache or vague discomfort to excruciating or colickypain. Examples include distention of the fallo-pian tube in ectopic pregnancy, uterine contrac-tions in dysmenorrhea, or stretch of the roundligament with advancing stages of pregnancy. Parietal (somatic) pelvic pain is caused by irri- tation of the parietal peritoneum. This is usuallycaused by infection, chemical irritation, or otherinflammatory processes. This type of pain is typic-ally sharp, knife-like and constant. Parietal pain, in contrast to visceral pain, can be localized to the dermatome directly above the painful stimu-lus. Parietal pain is responsible for the physicalexamination findings of tenderness to palpation,guarding, rebound and rigidity. Examples includesalpingitis and endometritis. Referred pain is defined as pain felt at a dis- tance from the involved organ. Pelvic pain may bereferred to the buttocks, back, groin, perineum, legs, or upper abdomen. History Clues gleaned from a careful history direct theexamination and subsequent diagnostic testing.Patients should always be asked about their sexualhistory and the possibility of pregnancy. Personal questions should be asked in a nonjudgmentalmanner and in strict privacy. Spouses, parents,29 Pelvic pain Peter G. Kumasaka, MD anatomy (sagittal).Pelvic pain 428 Primary Complaintsfriends or significant others should be asked to leave the room. This will encourage patients toprovide honest answers to questions. Even so, beaware that some patients may still not be truthful in their responses. How did the pain begin? How long have you had it? Have you had it before? Is there apattern to it? Sudden onset of pain may indicate a disease with significant morbidity and mortality, such as per-foration of a hollow viscus, intrapelvic hemor-rhage or vascular compromise (ovarian torsion). Chronic or recurrent pain can be associated withendometriosis, recurrent ovarian cysts, or a per-sistent ovarian mass. It is important to determinewhy the patient came in to seek help if she com-plains of chronic pain. The answer may reveal a new problem or a significant change of a chronic ailment. It is helpful to ascertain if the pain fol-lows a cyclical pattern, and its relationship to themenstrual cycle. The pain of endometriosis usu-ally accompanies the onset of menses, whereaspain associated with ovulation (Mittelschmerz)typically occurs during midcycle. How would you describe the pain? Pain that is sharp is more likely to be related to peritoneal irritation, whereas dull or crampy painsuggests contraction of an organ (e.g., uterus) orobstruction of a viscus (fallopian tube or ureter).Steady, progressive pain is associated withinflammatory or neoplastic causes. Where is the pain? The ability to localize the pain can be extremely helpful. Lateral pelvic pain can often be traced tothe fallopian tube or ovary; central pelvic painsuggests a process involving the bladder or uterus.Diffuse pain can occur with pelvic inflammatorydisease (PID) or peritonitis. How severe is the pain? Pain severity is subjective and not always helpful in directing the work-up. The patient complain-ing of \"severe\" pain whom you see laughingwith a friend is clearly not the same as the patientgrimacing and in tears. Pain can wax and wane,however, and different individuals assess, tolerate,and respond to pain differently.Does the pain radiate? Pain radiating to the low back may indicate ovar- ian or uterine pathology; radiation to the flanksmay be due to ureteral problems. Radiation of painto the rectum can be caused by blood or fluid col-lecting in the cul-de-sac. Does the pain occur during intercourse? Sudden onset of pain during intercourse often accompanies a ruptured ovarian cyst. Most othercauses of dyspareunia can be evaluated as an out- patient. These include gynecologic tumors, pelvicadhesions, adenomyosis, endometriosis, fibroidsand uterine retroversion. Are you pregnant? When was your last normal menstrual cycle? Describe anyprevious (especially abnormal)pregnancies? The possibility of pregnancy may significantly alter the differential diagnosis, as well as raise concernfor possible adverse effects of diagnostic testing ortherapeutic intervention. Assume that all womenof childbearing age may be pregnant despiteclaims of celibacy, the use of birth contr ligation) and reports of \"normal\" men- strual periods. If pregnant, risk factors for ectopicpregnancy should be identified (Table 29.1). Table 29.1 Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Risk factor Ectopic PID pregnancy Previous ectopic pregnancy Y es No History of PID Y es Y esTubal surgery Y es No Prior abdominal surgery Y es No or inflammatory condition (e.g., appendectomy or inflammatory bowel disease) Endometriosis Y es No Multiple sexual partners Y es Y esPresence of IUD Y es Y es Assisted fertility Y es No IUD: intrauterine device.Primary Complaints 429Pelvic painWhat is your sexual history? Obtaining a good sexual history, including a his- tory of sexually transmitted illnesses (STIs), birthcontrol devices, and sexual partners is imperative.Keep in mind that a monogamous patient doesnot mean a monogamous partner. Do you have any vaginal bleeding and/or discharge? In the nonpregnant patient, bleeding may be associated with a number of conditions includingdysmenorrhea, dysfunctional uterine bleedingor cancer (cervical or uterine). In the pregnantpatient, think of the ectopic pregnancy first. Otheretiologies include spontaneous miscarriage,threatened abortion or later complications ofpregnancy, such as placenta previa or abruption.Vaginal discharge is associated with PID, cervicitis and vaginitis. Associated symptoms Fever, nausea, vomiting, syncope, or urinarycomplaints Presence of a fever suggests an infectious cause of pain such as PID. Nausea or vomiting is morecommon with GI processes, but may also be seenin ureteral stones and ovarian torsion. Syncopeshould raise the suspicion for blood loss (e.g., rup-turedectopic pregnancy or hemorrhagic ovarian cyst), volume depletion, or sepsis (e.g., PID or per-forated appendix). Dysuria or other urinary tract symptoms may point to a simple cystitis or STI;however, these symptoms may also result fromirritation of the bladder as a consequence of freeperitoneal fluid or an ectopic pregnancy. Past medical Amedical history is imperative, and should detail any past pregnancies including associatedproblems. A history of abdominal or obstetric-gynecologic operations should be elicited.Systemic diseases also need to be reviewed. Recent procedures or surgeries raise concern for iatro-genic problems. The diabetic or immunocompro-mised patient may not be able to mount a normal response to an illness or infection. Mor e liberal laboratory testing and imaging studies should be used in evaluating these patients than for patientswith normal immune status.Medications Antibiotic (recent or current) or steroid use mayinfluence the patient's presentation by maskinginfectious processes. Birth control pills do notpreclude pregnancy, and many patients do notconsider oral contraceptives as medications. Social Alcoholics are relatively immunocompromised,unreliable for follow-up, and may be coagulo-pathic. Smokers have an increased risk of cancerand vascular disease (e.g., mesenteric ischemia andaneurysms). Patients with drug addiction maybe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) posi-tive, have lifestyles that put themselves at riskfor STIs, and may be unreliable for follow-up. Physical examination General appearance Begin your physical examination upon walkinginto the room. Always start by evaluating theAirway, Breathing and Circulation (ABCs). Again,if you deem the patient unstable, or are unsure,seek help immediately. If the patient can comfort-ably talk to you, then her airway and breathingare adequate. Feel the patient's pulse as you talkwith her. Can you feel one? Is it thready? Is it fast?Does the patient look pale, pasty or diaphoretic?Is she mentating properly? These findings maysuggest that she is in shock. Does she feel hot? Ifthe oral temperature is normal, check a rectal tem-perature when you are concerned about a fever. Vital signs Attention to the patient's vital signs should be noted on initial evaluation of the patient. Signifi-cant tachycardia or hypotension in a patient withpelvic or abdominal pain, or vaginal bleedingshould prompt aggressive measures, such asstarting intravenous (IV) fluids immediately.Paradoxically, the patient may be bradycardic inthe presence of intraperitoneal bleeding. Whenin doubt about the patient's stability, seek assist-ance immediately. Abdomen Adetailed discussion of the abdominal exam- ination is found in Chapter 9. Key aspects of theexamination with respect to pelvic pain are described below. Inspection Is the abdomen distended or gravid-appearing? Any ecchymoses? Grey Turner's sign (flank retr operi or bleeding. Check for the presence of hernias. If thepatient is pregnant, observe for fetal movement. Auscultation Listen for abdominal bruits, bowel sounds, or fetal heart tones if the patient is pregnant. Palpation Can the pain be localized to a specific area? You may be able to palpate masses (gravid uterus or distended bladder) or hernias. The patientmay need to valsalva or cough to make a herniaapparent. Pelvic Male and female physicians are equally advisedto have a chaperone present during the pelvicexamination. Allow the patient to empty herbladder or remove a tampon prior to the examin-ation. Position and drape the patient in such amanner that allows her to see you during theexamination. Explain and describe to the patienteach step of the examination and let her knowwhat she may feel. Ask the patient to mention if the examination is different or more painfulthan previous pelvic examinations. Monitor the patient's reaction and behavior to the pelvicexamination. Always be gentle and describe inadvance what you are going to do. Equipment You should have good lighting, a vaginal speculum of appropriate size, water-soluble lubricant and materials for bacteriologic studies and wet mountprior to starting the examination. External genitalia Inspect the external genitalia for any evidence of inflammation, trauma, ulceration, discharge,swelling or nodules. A Bartholin cyst may present as a vulvar mass or swelling. A vesicular rash mayrepresent genital herpes. Gently insert your fingerinto the patient's vagina and milk the urethra fromthe inside outward. Culture any discharge fromthe urethral orifice. Speculum Warming of a speculum under a stream of warm water helps avoid the shock and discomfort of a cold speculum. Lubricate the speculum prior to insertion. Begin by rotating the speculumobliquely, such that the handle hangs at about 4or 8 o'clock, and then slowly and gently advancethe speculum in a slightly posterior directionwhile rotating the speculum to allow the handleto hang straight down. Take care to avoid themore sensitive anterior vaginal wall and urethra.Open the blades gently, and note the cervix. If thecervix is not visible, try repositioning the specu-lum by slowly withdrawing it; often this maneu-ver allows the cervix to \"drop\" into view. Note the appearance of the cervix. In pregnancy, the cervix may have a bluish hue (Chadwick'ssign). The cervix and the cervical os should be inspected for blood, polyps, masses, inflamma-tion, ulceration, signs of infection and the presenceof an intrauterine device (IUD). The presenceand description of any discharge in the cervixshould be noted. Is it bloody, frothy, purulent or mucoid? Samples of any discharge or tissue should be sent for appropriate testing. In the presence of bleeding and early preg- nancy, assess the patency of the cervical os.Gently insert the ring forceps into the os. If theforceps can be inserted more than a centimeter orso, the internal os may be open, indicating anincomplete or inevitable miscarriage. If a patientin her third trimester presents with vaginalbleeding, do not attempt to assess if the cervical os is open. Severe hemorrhage may result if pla-centa previa is present. Prior to and while slowly withdrawing the speculum, inspect the vagina for signs of infection,trauma, lesions or foreign bodies, as well as blood,tissue or discharge. Bimanual Next, perform a bimanual examination. Though the diagnostic accuracy of this examination hasbeen questioned, every woman with pelvic painshould have a bimanual examination. Gentlyinsert a lubricated middle finger intothe patient's vagina. gynecologic etiologies. Likewise, palpation Pelvic pain 430 Primary Complaintsof the posterior wall may identify rectal or sphinc- ter pathology. With two fingers in the vaginalvault and one hand on the pubic region, palpatethe uterus for size, tenderness or masses. Place thecervix between the two fingers in the vault, andgently move it side to side. Exquisite pain or dis-comfort from this maneuver is known as cervical motion tenderness (CMT), producing the \"chande- lier sign\" (denoting the patient jumping off thetable to grab the chandelier with movement of thecervix). Though CMT has classically been associ-ated with PID, its presence is nonspecific and mayrepresent irritation from an inflamed appendix, ruptured cyst or ectopic pregnancy. Importantly, CMT is also an insensitive finding, as it may bemild or absent in patients with PID. Next, sweep the fingers to the adnexal regions. Start by examining the nontender side. With theexternal hand, pull the fingertips firmly but gen-tly downward and feel for any adnexal massesand tenderness. Adnexal masses include ovariancysts, tumors, or swollen fallopian tubes associ-ated with PID or tubal pregnancy. In a patientwith severe discomfort, adnexal palpation maybe facilitated by the administration of an anal-gesic (e.g., morphine). Lastly, a rectovaginal examination is performed with one digit in the vagina and one in the rectum.Sweep these fingers back and forth in a horizon-tal plane to feel for any masses, fullness or areas ofdiscomfort. The rectovaginal examination allowsfor the evaluation of the posterior of or endometriosis).Rectal The rectal examination can reveal the presence ofgross blood, nodularity or mass in the rectum.Ask the patient if the examination was painful orjust uncomfortable. Breast Breast engorgement or tenderness may indicatepregnancy or a change related to menstrual cycle. Lymph Femoral and inguinal nodes should be evaluatedfor size and tenderness.

Pelvic pain 434 diagnosis of pelvic pain vein thrombosis Sickle cell anemiaDiagnostic testing Laboratory studies Pregnancy test This test should be ordered for any female patient of childbearing potential presenting with pelvicpain. The history of birth control use, tubal liga-tion and abstinence should not dissuade youfrom testing for pregnancy. Although infrequent,failure may occur with all forms of birth control.Quantitative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin(beta-HCG) testing may be helpful when thepresence of a normal intrauterine pregnancy(IUP) is in question. In early pregnancy, the levelof beta-HCG normally (approximately) doublesevery 48 hours. Progesterone level Several studies have examined the use of a pro- gesterone level to rule out ectopic pregnancy. OnePrimary Complaints 435Pelvic painstrategy involves using a two-tiered cutoff, with low levels ( /H110215ng/ml) associated with an abnor- mal pregnancy (but not specifically ectopic preg-nancy); levels above 25 ng/ml indicate a normalIUP with a high degree of specificity (however,levels less than this can be found in normal preg- nancies). This still leaves the gray area between these cutoffs, where there is insufficient sensitiv-ity and specificity to differentiate normal fromabnormal pregnancy. In such cases, a commonstrategy is to combine the beta-HCG level or USresult with the progesterone level. Currently, there does not appear to be consistent agreementabout the utility of progesterone levels in the ED,and they are not often readily available. Urinalysis Virtually all patients with pelvic pain should have a urinalysis, although further confirmatory testing should be guided by clinical suspicion. Hematuriahas been noted in patients with several conditions,including AAA and kidney stones. Pyuria (pres-ence of white cells) can be present in inflammatoryconditions adjacent to the bladder or ureter (e.g.,appendicitis), as well as in urinary tract infections. Complete blood count Though the white blood cell (WBC) count is often ordered, many studies have shown thatthis test has limited clinical utility. The value ofthe WBC count is not useful, except if it isextremely high or extremely low. The hemoglo-bin and hematocrit may be helpful in patientswho are bleeding heavily or showing evidence ofhemodynamic compromise. Take note, however,that these values may not reflect changes due toacute hemorr hage, and may not adequately reflect the patient's current circulating blood volume. Electrolytes Electrolytes will only occasionally aid the work- up of a patient with pelvic pain. Knowing theblood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine maybe helpful for diagnostic testing purposes (e.g.,contrast-enhanced CT scan). Cervical cultures Cultures for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia , as well as a wet prep for Trichomonas , Gardnerella vaginalis and yeast should be obtained when suspecting PID or if the patient complains of a vaginal dis-charge.Other Some patients will require blood products, and anticipating this by ordering appropriate labora-tories is helpful. Type and crossmatch of blood is needed in the patient exhibiting vital sign instabil-ity, whereas type and screen may be indi cated for patients who are bleeding and may need blood onshort notice. Rh factor should be ordered in all patients who are pregnant and bleeding. Someinstitutions require checking the Rh factor on allpregnant patients with vaginal bleeding evenwhen the patient claims to know their Rh status orrecords are available with the patient's Rh status. This policy may reduce medical error in the rareinstance of obtaining the wrong patient's record.Additionally, in some EDs, the misuse of some-one else's identification card is not uncommon.DIC profiles should be for the patientwith suspected placental abruption. Protime andpartial thromboplastin time should be orderedfor patients with bleeding disorders, those takinganticoagulants, in cases of suspected DIC or thepotential to develop DIC, or patients who arehemodynamically unstable. Radiologic studies Pelvic ultrasound US can be very helpful in the work-up of pelvicpain. Transvaginal US is the test of choice to evalu-ate for IUP , ovarian lesions, ovarian torsion andTOA(Figure 29.3). Furthermore, it can provide information on the presence of pelvic fluid, uterinemasses, or retained products of conception. Of note, for first-trimester bleeding, the useful- ness of US must be assessed in conjunction withthe patient's clinical situation and laboratory val-ues. Transvaginal US can typically detect thepresence of an IUP at a beta-HCG level of approx-imately 1500 mIU/ml (around the 5th to 6th weekby dates). This discriminatory zone varies by institu- tion, and may lie between 1000 and 2000 mIU/ml. At levels above the discriminatory zone, a viableIUP should be visible by transvaginal US; if anIUP is not visualized, then it is likely a non-viablepregnancy, ectopic pregnancy or inevitable mis-carriage. Although rare, an heterotopic pregnancy cially if the patient undergone assisted fertil-ization. The incidence of heterotopic pregnancy istypically cited at 1 in 30,000. However, recent datasuggest it may be 1 in 3000-7000, and much higher(1 in 100) if infertility medications or in vitro fertil- ization ha s been used. Clinical suspicion shouldPelvic pain 436 Primary Complaintsguide your work-up in these patients. At levels below the discriminatory zone, if an IUP is notseen on transvaginal US, then a normal pregnancy,threatened miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy islikely. Consult with the Ob/Gyn service if the clin-icalsuspicion for an ectopic pr egnancy is high. Otherwise, have the patient follow-up for a repeatbeta-HCG in 48 hours. An explanation of indica-tions for the patient to return immediately to theED (e.g., syncope, heavy bleeding, fever, or severepain) is important. Computed tomography CT is another modality for assessing the abdom- inal and pelvic structures. CT can identify ureteralstones, AAA, as well as areas of inflammation(e.g., pelvic abscesses or appendicitis). Some of thestudies may require IV contrast, which may limit use in patients with renal failure or allergies to IVcontrast dye. Oral and/or rectal contrast may beneeded as well, and its ability to pass through theGI tract may affect the quality of the images. Though the use of CT is increasing as a result of increasing availability and improved sensitiv-ity and specificity, US is generally considered theimaging study of first choice in patients withpelvic pain. This is especially true in young orpregnant patients, because CT will expose thepelvis to significant amounts of radiation. US candelineate most of the true pelvic inflammatoryconditions, may demonstrate appendicitis, andcan give information regarding blood flow to theovaries if ovarian torsion is a concern. General treatment principles Stabilization As with any patient, assessment and stabilization of airway, breathing and circulatory status arethe first duties of the emergency physician. Thismay necessitate the need for intubation, IV flu-ids, or the use of blood products. Intravenous access/fluids Two large bore IVs should be placed in patients exhibiting hemodynamic compromise, or whenthere is a strong suspicion of significant hemor-rhage or sepsis (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, endo- metritis). Patients unable to tolerate oral fluids andthose who need to be kept NPO may benefit fromIV fluids. Furthermore, patients who require mul-tiple doses of parenteral medication, blood andblood products, or IV contrast require an IV . Pain relief Relieving pain is one of the primary responsi-bilities of emergency physicians. Often, narcoticanalgesics are used to alleviate a patient's pain.Their administration does not interfere with mak-ing the diagnosis. Withholding pain medications isinhumane and this practice should be condemned. Other medications such as non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help. NSAIDshelp relieve prostaglandin-mediated pain, such asthat created by smooth muscle contraction (e.g.,uterine cramping). If the patient is unable to tol-erate fluids, or needs to be NPO, then ketorolacmay be useful. Studies do not show a faster orstronger effect from ketorolac via intramuscular(IM) injection versus ibuprofen; however, this hasnot been examined when ketorolac is given IV . Antibiotics The diagnosis, patient condition and other patient-related issues guide antibiotic coverage and routes of administration as well as the decision for inpatient versus outpatient treatment. Factorsthat influence the specific therapy choseninclude the patient's condition, comorbid condi-tions, likelihood of patient compliance, local Figure 29.3 Tubo-ovarian abscess.

Antibiotic selection for treating STIs should cover N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis . For simple cervicitis, one time oral regimens are available and often given in the ED. PID can be managedas an outpatient if the patient's pain can be con-trolled, peritoneal signs are absent, adequate follow-up is ensured, and the patient can tolerateoral medications. Otherwise, parenteral antibioticsand admission are indicated. Unlike a simplecervicitis, PID appears to be a polymicrobial dis-ease.

Inpatient, parenteral therapy is indicated if the patient is immuno-compromised, pregnant or has failed outpatienttherapy (Table 29.3). Other pelvic infections, such as endometritis, require broad coverage of Gram-negative, Gram- positive and anaerobic organisms. Broad-spectrumantibiotics include third-generation cephalosporin. Blood products Ablood transfusion is indicated in the patient who is hemodynamically unstable from hemor-rhage and unresponsive to crystalloid boluses. A type and screen or crossmatch should be sent forthose patients who are resuscitated, or whomyou suspect may become unstable. Fresh frozenplasma (FFP) is given if the patient develops DIC.DIC can develop in septic patients and thosewith severe hemorrhage from placental abrup-tion. FFP may be needed for patients on warfarin(coumadin). Platelets may be needed for throm-bocytopenic states such thrombocyto-penic purpura (ITP). for the Rh-negative preg-nant patient who presents with vaginal bleeding, suspected or proven placental abruption, andtrauma with the potential for fetal-maternal trans-fusion or pr oven fetal-maternal transfusion (by Kleihauer-Betke testing). Dosing is based on ges- tational age. Low dose Rho-GAM (MicRho- GAM)is given for miscarriages, abortion or ectopic preg-nancy termination to Rh-negative mothers when between 0 and 12 weeks gestational age. Thisdose is 50 mcg. Beyond 12 weeks and for threat-ened miscarriage at any gestational age, full doseRho-GAM (300 mcg) is given. In the situation offetal-maternal hemorrhage, 300 mcg is given forevery 15 ml of fetal red blood cells (or 30 ml of fetalwhole blood) that the mother has been exposedto based on Kleihauer-Betke testing. Medications Other than analgesics and antibiotics, other medications may be needed to treat the patient.Antiemetics are useful for intractable or problem-aticnausea and vomiting. Methotrexate can beused in selective patients for the treatment ofectopic pregnancy. Misoprostol has been used inpatients with incomplete or inevitable miscar-riages. Special patients Pediatric The physician must be diligent to search for acause of pelvic pain in the young patient. Due tosocial, cultural and parenteral pressures, thesepatients and their parents may be scared or embar-rassed to answer questions about their sexuality and genitalia, much less undergo a pelvic examin-ation. Any child that is perimenar chal should be assumed pregnant until proven otherwise. Prepubertal children are most likely to present with pelvic pain secondary to vaginal foreignbody, urinary tract infection or sexual abuse. Apelvic examination is still indicated in these patients to assess for evidence of abuse. A modi-fied approach can be used, but a full pelvic exam-ination may be required under conscious sedationor general anesthesia. Proper collection of sam-ples and precise documentation are required forevidence if a criminal case is suspected. Mostlocal police departments have developed a sex-ual assault kit for these purposes. Child protectiveservices should be consulted in cases of suspectedor proven abuse or STI. All states allow minors to consent to evalu- ation and treatment of STIs and drug abuse with- out parental consent. There is also the legal statusof the emancipated minor and the mature minor , which varies from state to state. These statutesallow minors certain rights, including seeking andconsenting to medical care without the author-ization and notification of their parents. Keep inmind that any emergent care deemed necessaryshould supercede any parental rights. Geriatric The older patient may not be willing or able tocommunicate her problems. Nursing home work-ers, paramedics and family, as well as the patient'smedical chart may be extremely useful, particu-larly if they provide information on any associ-ated signs or symptoms. In general, the olderpatient is relatively immunocompromised and ismore likely to have other comorbid problemsthat can affect the presentation and the work-up.Older patients with pelvic pain need a completegynecologic examination. Often, the geriatricPrimary Complaints 439Pelvic painpatient will not present with the \"classic\" symp- toms of an acute inflammatory process such asappendicitis or diverticulitis. They may notdevelop a fever, mount an increased WBC count, orhave peritoneal signs. As a result, the morbid- ity and mortality of abdomino-pelvic complaintsin the elderly patient is significant. The physiologic drop in estrogen levels with age can cause vaginal irritation and thinning of the mucosa. On the other hand, unopposedestrogen levels secondary to decreased proges-terone can lead to endometrial ure-throceles. Furthermore, the ovary shouldnot be palpable 5 years after menopause; anyenlargement is abnormal and mandates furtherinvestigation. Chemically dependant or impaired Patients who are intoxicated can present with painthat may be overlooked. Their ability to relate acoherent history may likewise present problemsfor the clinician. Despite these issues, such patientsmay be at higher risk to develop certain diseases(e.g., STIs, ectopic pregnancy) and at the same timeare less likely to be able to schedule a follow-upappointment, purchase or take their medications,or return if the problem worsens. Assisted reproductive therapy Today, more patients are undergoing some form of assisted reproductive therapy (ART). This hasraised the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), as well as the presence of mul- tiple gestations. OHSS can be mild to severe. Inits mild form, patients may feel some distensionand pain; when it becomes severe, the patientmay present with extremely large ovaries (over10 cm) and large amounts of free fluid in theabdomen. Electrolyte abnormalities, hypoten-sion, pleural effusions an d oliguria may ensue. The use of ART has increased the prevalence of multiple gestation pregnancies. Along with therise in multiple gestations, the risk for heterotopic pregnancy has increased as well. The presence of an ectopic pregnancy should be considered evenif an IUP is present by US. Other Patients who are unable to communicate clearly(e.g., language barrier or mentally handicapped)deserve a thorough and sensitive investigation.Even a mentally-challenged patient can contractSTIs and develop ectopic pregnancies. The non-English speaking patient may also be more of achallenge due to cultural issues or anatomicproblems (e.g., female circumcision). Disposition Obstetric/gynecologic consultation Ob/Gyn should be consulted for all ectopic preg-nancies. If a definitive IUP is not identified andthe possibility of an ectopic pregnancy exists,consultation should also occur; definitive follow-up should be arranged for a repeat evalua tion and beta-HCG determination. Other cases not pain) and activelabor. All of these patients generally requireadmission. Patients also require admission forother significant pelvic infections, uncontrolledpain and inability to tolerate fluids or oral med-ications. Ob/Gyn should be contacted for a patient with problematic ovarian cysts, follow-up ofpelvic infections, any complications of pelvicprocedures, and ongoing/threatened miscarriage.The patient may not need to be seen immediately,but input from the Ob/Gyn consultant should beobtained and follow-up arranged. Admission Admission is the general rule for acute life- orfertility-threatening diseases. The patient who isat risk for failing outpatient therapy due to noncompliance, chemical dependency, social situations, comorbid diseases or associated con-ditions (e.g., vomiting) should be deemed a can-didate for inpatient treatment. Discharge Many patients may be managed on an outpatientbasis with close Ob/Gyn follow-up and strictinstructions to return for appropriate indica-tions. Returning to the ED is a viable alternativeif unable to follow-up in Ob/Gyn clinic. Thealternative of losing a patient to follow-up with aresultant adverse outcome is unacceptable. For example, outpatient medical treatment of selectedectopic pregnancies with methotrexate is possiblePelvic pain 440 Primary Complaintsif the patient is hemodynamically stable, has ade- quate pain control, tolerates fluids by mouth, isreliable, and can follow-up appropriately. This patient should return to the ED if she developsintractable nausea, severe pain, fever, severeweakness, lightheadedness, or has syncope. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths All women of childbearing age should beconsidered pregnant until proven otherwise. Do not rely on the patient's beta-HCG todecide whether to order a pelvic US whenconsidering ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies produce beta-HCG at anabnormal rate. A beta-HCG level above thediscriminatory zone only helps to determineif a viable IUP should be visible ontransvaginal US. Therefore, use the beta-HCGto assist with interpretation of the pelvic US. Heterotopic pregnancy has a reportedincidence as low as 1:100 in patientsundergoing ART. Therefore, it must beconsidered even with confirmed IUPs. Patientsnot undergoing ART still have a possibility ofheterotopic pregnancy, although thelikelihood is much lower. Clinical suspicionshould guide the work-up. Empirically treat suspected PID and STIsbefore laboratory results return. These oftenwill not be back before the patient'sdisposition from the ED, and major life- orfertility-threatening sequelae may occur (e.g.,abscess, sepsis, infertility). Many patients atgreatest risk of developing these diseases areof limited financial resources, suffer fromsubstance abuse, or have other problemslimiting their access to care and follow-up. Several diagnoses can be missed without fullconsideration of other diagnostic possibilities(e.g., ovarian torsion). An ovarian cyst ormass may predispose a patient to ovariantorsion. These may not be appreciated onpelvic examination despite their presence. Infact, some question the diagnostic value ofthe pelvic examination, especially in theobese patient. Consider sexual/physical abuse in patients,especially if they present with nonspecificcomplaints or inconsistent findings. Often,the only way to uncover this history is todirectly ask the patient in a private setting.Therefore, it is prudent to ask any friends,spouses, boyfriends, girlfriends or familymembers to leave the room when obtainingthis history. Consider non-pelvic etiologies for a patient'spelvic pain. Furthermore, pain may be theresult of some catastrophic conditions, which must be considered and aggressivelymanaged if present.

Skin disease can represent awide array of disease processes, from a local der-matologic disease to the manifestation of anunderlying systemic illness. The majority of rashesthat present to the emergency department (ED)involve infections, irritants, and allergies. While most of these rashes are benign and self-limited, cutaneous lesions are often the firstclinical sign of serious systemic disease. Derma-tologic findings can be associated with seriousinfectious diseases including meningococcemia,gonococcemia, cellulitis, toxic shock syndrome,staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, dissem-inated herpetic infections, and Rocky Mountainspotted Other potentially syndrome (SJS),toxic (TEN), and urticariawith anaphylaxis) can inflammatory skin diseases (pustular psoriasis, pemphigus, pemphigoid,and lupus) also have the potential to be life-threatening (Table 30.1).Anatomic essentials The skin is divided into three layers. The outerlayer is the epidermis , which serves as the outer most protective barrier against the environment.Underneath the epidermis, the vascularizeddermis provides support and nutrition for the cells in the epidermis. Other important skin structuresare also found in the dermal layer, including nerves,sweat glands, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands.The inner most layer is the subcutaneous tissue . History Acomplete history of the eruption is essential and should include the duration, rate of onset, andlocation of the current eruption. Symptoms includ-ing pruritus, pain, and fever should be noted. When did the rash begin? Sudden onset of a rash is more concerning than a rash that has been present for days. Suddenonset of rash while eating shellfish most likelyrepresents an allergic reaction, which may signal the beginning of anaphylaxis. A rash that developsafter three days of fever in a 12-month-old child islikely roseola infantum, a benign condition whichresolves spontaneously. Where on your body did you first notice therash, and did it spread? Identifying the location the rash first appeared helps further differentiate its etiology. Rashes thatpresent on the scalp and then erupt on the elbowsmay represent psoriasis. Rocky Mountain spotted fever starts on the wrists and ankles, then spreadsto the trunk. Have you had this rash before? Rashes that are recurrent are more likely to represent an underlying dermatitis or non- infectious systemic illness, such as a recurringrash on the face from seborrheic dermatitis. Did you have a fever or recent fever? In both children and adults, fever associated with rash often signifies the presence of an infection.30 Rash Jamie Collings, MDand Brigham Temple, MD Table 30.1 Life-threatening dermatoses anaphylaxisRash 444 Primary ComplaintsFor example, a young child with fever and sore throat that presents with a diffuse, r ed, sand- paper-like rash on the trunk, back, and extremities is likely to have scarlet fever. Fever with suddenonset of a petechial rash in a college student ismeningococcemia until proven otherwise. Does the rash itch? Rashes that itch indicate an inflammatory reac- tion in the skin with histamine release. Pruritusrepresents an intradermal inflammatory response that can be from a local exposure to an irritant ora systemic reaction, such as an allergic reaction toshellfish. The patient who presents with pruritusand linear eruptions on his hands or legs after arecent hiking trip likely has contact dermatitis from poison ivy exposure. Intense pruritis is oftenassociated with scabies or urticaria. Is the rash painful? Ahistory that the rash is associated with pain may be significant. With herpes zoster, pain often precedes the rash. In patients with necrotizingfasciitis, the pain may be out of proportion tophysical examination findings. Did you use any new soaps, perfumes, lotions, or detergents? Many commercially-sold products contain chem- icals that can produce a local inflammatory reac-tion. The patient who presents with a new rashon their trunk and arms after changing laundrydetergent brands likely has contact dermatitis.Many lotions for dry skin contain alcohol, whichmay exacerbate eczema or contact dermatitis. Did you use any medications for the rash? There are many over-the-counter medications available to the public, from antihistamines totopical steroid ointments. Use of such medicationsprior to seeking medical attention may indicate apartially- or under-treated medical condition.Furthermore, some of these therapies may exac-erbate instead of alleviate the rash, such as topi-cal steroid use on a cutaneous fungal infection. What medications do you take regularly? Any new medications? Rashes associated with medications can range from mild allergic eruptions to anaphylaxis orother life-threatening systemic complications.Therefore, a complete history of past and currentmedications, dosages, duration of therapy, andprior history of allergic or adverse reactions tothese medications must be elicited. Recent immun-izations may account for an allergic eruption or exanthem. It is also essential to review patient useof over-the-counter medications, herbals, dietarysupplements, and vitamins. Do you have any known environmental allergies or exposures? Home or work exposure to chemicals that may be irritants may cause a contact dermatitis. Exposureto animal dander, insects bites, and plants mayrepresent allergic contact dermatitis. A history of recent sun exposure may represent sunburn, atopic dermatitis, or an allergic reaction. Associated symptoms Respiratory Ask about nasal discharge, sore throat, shortness of breath, and cough . Viral infections often present with upper respiratory symptoms and help sig-nal an infectious etiology of the rash. Childrenare more likely to have viral exanthems, such ashand-foot-mouth disease and measles. Adultviral infections such as influenza and adenovirusare rarely associated with rashes. Bacterial sources,such as Streptococcus , should also be considered. Wheezing and shortness of breath are often asso-ciated with urticaria. Gastrointestinal Ask about abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea . Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are pre- sent in 90% of patients with Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Other viral etiologies may also have GIsymptoms. Neurologic Ask about altered mental status, headache, seizures, and other neurologic symptoms . Meningitis may first present with fever encephalitis isassociated with herpes and varicella viruses. Genitourinary Ask about pregnancy, sexual history, and any prior GU lesions . Syphilis may not be recognized until thesecondary stages, when a rash is involved. Many etiologies of rash have few side effects on the typ- ical patient, but can be devastating to an unbornfetus or immune compromised individual. Past medical Ahistory of previous and recurrent eruptions along with other systemic disease (e.g., diabetes,systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and cancer)is helpful in order to identify the cause of therash. Environmental and chemical exposuresshould be considered by reviewing the patient'soccupational history and hobbies. Family Family history of rashes and certain systemic ill-nesses, such as SLE, should be considered.Allergies to medications and foods in family mem-bers should be identified, and may be helpful. Physical examination Although the history may help narrow the differ-ential diagnosis, the ability to identify, interpret,and describe what is observed is more important.Rashes are classified using specific nomenclature(Tables 30.2 and 30.3). Further descriptors for shape are ing serpiginous, arcuate, annular, discoid, target,dermatomal, and confluent. Physical examination of patients with a rash should be performed from head-to-toe with thepatient completely disrobed in a well-lit exam-ination room. The practitioner should allowplenty of time for a thorough physical examin-ation of the skin. General appearance The general appearance of the patient will oftensuggest the severity of underlying disease causingthe rash in question. Patients who have viral exan-thems may be well-appearing or sick-appearing depending on the severity of infection. Patientswith serious bacterial infections are likely toappear ill. Patients with urticarial rash associatedwith anaphylaxis will exhibit signs of respiratorydistress or anxiety if the oropharynx or respiratorytract is involved. Severely pruritic rashes oftencause patients to feel restless and agitated. For the most part, however, the majority of patients pre-senting with rash appear well, although uncom-fortable.Term Definition Macule Flat, non-palpable discoloration, /H110211c m in size.

Conversely, the afebrile patient may stillhave a rash secondary to an infectious cause.Patients with petechial or purpural lesions, andsigns of sepsis (tachycardia and hypotension) arepresumed to have a bacterial infection with bac-teremia and should be aggressively resuscitated. Other vital signs may be helpful in diagnosing an infectious systemic process or an acute allergic reaction with anaphylaxis. However , most infec- tious causes of rash do not affect the heart rate,blood pressure, or respiratory rate, unless accom-panied by severe dehydration, sepsis, or airway compromise. Head and neck Inspection of the head and neck should focus onidentifying signs of infection. The scalp andmucosa should be inspected for rash or lesions.Erythema or lesions may indicate a systemic viralinfection, such as Koplik's spots in the buccalmucosa which occur with measles infection.Examine the soft palate for petechiae, which mayindicate an underlying streptococcal infection.When an allergic reaction is suspected, look for softpalate and uvular edema. Examine the neck forsigns of infection, reactive nodes,swollen glands, and nuchal rigidity. Auscultate theneck for stridor if an allergic reaction is suspected. Genital Rashes in the groin and on the genitalia necessitatea thorough examination. A pelvic examination maybe indicated if disseminated gonococcal infection ispossible, or staphylococcal toxic shock syndromesecondary to a retained foreign body (i.e., tam- pon) in the vaginal canal is suspected. Tests for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like syphilis (Figure 30.1) and gonorrhea should be performed. Skin The skin should be examined in a systematic andorderly process noting the distribution, pattern,arrangement, and morphology of the rash. Manyrashes have a predilection for certain areas of thebody, so the patient should have a thoroughexamination. The pattern of the rash should be noted. A rash only on skin exposed to the environment or a par-ticular object points to reactions associated withsun exposure, jewelry (nickel), or lotions. Pityriasisrosea is typically localized to the trunk and prox- imal extremities (Figure 30.2). The lesions ofhand-foot-mouth disease are located where thename implies. Erythema nodosum and Henoch-Schonlein purpura (Figure 30.3) have a predilec-tion for the lower extremities. Lesion arrangement, which refers to both the symmetry and configuration, should be noted.Rashes that are bilaterally symmetric often signifysystemic disease or uniform external exposure.Configuration refers to the relationship betweenmultiple lesions, such as the linear pattern in apoison ivy exposure and the Christmas-tree dis-tribution of pityriasis rosea (Figure 30.2). Recognition of the primary lesion is vital in establishing the diagnosis. The primary lesioncan be altered by secondary issues, includingexcoriation, healing, or complications of infection.Once the primary lesion is noted and its morph-ology determined, the differential diagnosis ofthe most likely causes can be made (Table 30.4).

Specific tests for viral infections, such as theTzanck smear for herpetic eruptions, can be per-formed when the diagnosis is in question. Patientspresenting with severe bacterial infections or signsof cardiovascular collapse, as in sepsis, requireappropriate testing, which includes the following:complete blood count (CBC) with differential to look for signs of hemolysis, leukocytosis and demarginization; prothrombin time/partialthromboplastin purpura; Gram's stain to iden-tify organisms; blood cultures for identification ofbacteremia; and chemistries to look for signs ofrenal failure or electrolyte abnormalities. Lyme serologies, VDRL testing or erythro-cyte sedimentation rate (ESR) testing for vasculitisshould be obtained if indicated. For rashes from non-infectious causes, labora- tories should be directed towards identification (a) (b) Figure 30.10 Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Results for suchtesting may not be available immediately andshould be done in conjunction with the appropri-ate follow-up physician. General treatment principles The treatment of rashes varies greatly based on the cause of the eruption and the severity of theillness. The main goal of treatment is largely sup-portive and symptomatic, aimed at relieving painand pruritus. Usually only those patients withsevere systemic illness from overwhelminginfection, fluid losses, and severe pain require inpatient care. Volume repletion Patients with signs of sepsis, as in toxic shocksyndrome, or with severe fluid losses, as in toxicepidermal necrolysis, should be aggressivelyresuscitated with intravenous crystalloid fluid. The rate of repletion is based on the patient'sdegree of hypovolemia as evidenced by the vitalsigns and physical examination. Pruritis and pain control Patients often present complaining not just ofrash, but also of pruritus and pain. Use of anti-histamines (oral and topical) for symptomaticrelief coupled with topical steroid agents or sys- temic corticosteroids as indicated provide thepatient with significant relief. N on-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and narcotics should be used judiciously for pain control. For example, adults with zoster should be given highdoses of NSAIDs with or without narcotics forpain and inflammation. NSAIDs are to be avoidedin children with varicella or chickenpox due tothe risk of Reye's syndrome. Emollients Emollient creams and lotions restore water and lipids to the epidermis. Preparations thatcontain urea or lactic acid have special lubricat-ing properties, and may be the most effective.Creams are thicker and more lubricating thanlotions, and many lotions contain alcohol to easeapplication. As petroleum jelly and mineral oilcontain no water, water should be added to the skin prior to application. Topical corticosteroids Topical steroids are the most powerful tool for treating dermatologic diseases. There are manyproducts, and new ones are introduced fre-quently. Steroids are divided by potency, fromGroup I to Group VII (I is the strongest, VII is theweakest). Their effects result in part from theirability to induce vasoconstriction of small vesselsin the dermis. It is this degree of vasoconstrictionthat determines a steroid's grouping. Loweringthe concentration of the drug would not neces-sarily decrease the vasoconstriction; many havethe Generic substi-tutes are not necessarily equivalent (mostimportant for potent steroids), and adequatepotency and treatment length are important con-siderations when prescribing. Physicians shouldavoid prescribing a weaker, \"safe\" preparationthat fails to give the desired anti-inflammatoryeffect and prolongs the disease, often leading tosecondary infection. The base determines the rateat which the active ingredient is absorbed throughthe skin. Creams are somewhat greasy, usable inmost areas, cosmetically most acceptable, andbest for intertriginous ar eas. Ointments are translucent, greasy, more lubricating, havegreater penetration than cr eams, and are too occlusive for use in acute eczematous inflamma-tion or intertriginous areas. Gels are clear and use- ful for acute exudative inflammation, such as poison ivy, and in the hair because they r esult in less \"matting\" of the hair. Lotions are clear or milky, most useful for the scalp, and may resultin stinging and drying when applied to intertrig-inous areas. The amount of cream dispensed isimportant; 1 g of cream covers 10 cm /H1100310 cm of skin, 20-30 g covers the entire skin of mostadults. For ointments, the amount that fits onyour fingertip typically covers the equivalent ofthe front and back of the hand. Antivirals and antibiotics Viral exanthems do not require antibiotics. However, the use of antivirals in varicella, zoster, and herpetic eruptions may change the duration ofsymptoms, decrease the incidence of post-herpeticneuralgia, or decrease future outbreaks. For bacterial infections, topical antibiotic ointmentsPrimary Complaints 459Rashin superficial cutaneous infections or intra- venous antibiotics in patients with systemicinfections are necessary. Antibiotics should betargeted to cover the likely bacterial pathogens. Antifungals The newest class of antifungal agents, the ally-lamines (e.g., terbinafine), have been shown toproduce higher cure rates and more rapidresponses in dermatophyte infections than older agents. Some of the oral medications (fluconazole)are effective in weekly dosing patterns, which mayincrease compliance. Since most fungal infectionsrequire long treatment courses (2-12 weeks or more), lack of compliance is frequently associatedwith treatment failure. Other side effects, such ashepatic injury, have been associated with keto-conazole and less frequently griseofulvin. Becauseof this, monitoring liver enzymes is advised. Immunosuppressants Autoimmune-mediated disorders may requirethe use of systemic steroids or other medicationsto produce immunosuppression. Immuno-suppressant medications should be given onlyafter consultation with the appropriate specialist.Such medications carry with them severe adverseeffects, and often need close monitoring to preventiatrogenic disease. Special patients Elderly Geriatric patients are often on more medicationsthan children and adults. Therefore, reviewing medications and recent changes is extremely important in this population, as allergic reactions may occur in addition to dr ug-drug interactions. Furthermore, the geriatric population may nottolerate treatment recommendations, like anti-histamines or analgesics. Pediatric Many of the viral exanthems occur only in child-hood and are self-limited. Exanthems were pre-viously consecutively numbered according historical appearance and description: First disease: measles are immunocompromised are moresusceptible to infection and secondary infectionwhen the integrity of the skin barrier has beencompromised. Suspected bacterial infections inthis group should be treated aggressively withappropriate antibiotics and observation in thehospital if systemic illness is feared. Disposition Dermatologic consultation The majority of patients with complaints of rashdo not require an emergent consultation with adermatologist. Emergency physicians and pri-mary care physicians can adequately treat andcare for most disease processes. In patients withsevere dermatologic disease or in cases where thediagnosis remains in question, dermatologic con-sult is required for possible biopsy and analysis. Admission Most patients with complaints of a rash do notrequire inpatient care. Such care is reserved for those with systemic bacterial infection, signs ofsepsis, severe dehydration, and intractable pain.Patients who require admission should first beadequately resuscitated in the ED with appropri-ate therapies initiated. A dermatology or infec-tious disease consultation can be obtained inassociation with the admission. Discharge After a thorough evaluation in the ED, manypatients can be discharged home with support-ive care instructions. Follow-up should be sched-uled for these patients within 1-2 days to ensurethat no other signs or symptoms of systemic ill-ness or secondary infection have begun, and toevaluate their response to outpatient therapy.Referral to a dermatologic specialist should bemade in those patients who have severe diseaseor a chronic dermatologic process. Pregnantwomen exposed to a patient with rubella, vari-cella or fifth disease are at risk for fetal complica-tions, and therefore need expeditious follow-upwith appropriate healthcare professionals.Rash 460 Primary ComplaintsPearls, pitfalls, and myths Most rashes are benign and self-limited, requiring only supportive care. A few can be life-threatening and should not beoverlooked (Table 30.1). History and physical examination is vital todiagnose a rash or identify its cause. Toxic epidermal necrolysis and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome look similar;however, the first requires removal of theoffending agent (often an antibiotic) and thesecond requires treatment with an antibiotic. The rash of toxic shock syndrome can beindistinct and should be considered inpatients with fever and volume depletionassociated with a rash. The early rash of meningococcemia may bemacular, maculopapular, or petechial; earlyidentification is important and potentiallylife-saving. Extensive work-ups with laboratory studiesare often unnecessary and should bediscouraged in the ED evaluation of most rashes. Urticarial skin lesions may be the first sign ofinfection, infestation, or systemic diseasewhich requires further investigation.While the disease causing the rash may bebenign, patients who are immunecompromised or pregnant may have higherrisks of complications.

This complaint causes a highlevel of patient and health car e provider anxiety, owing to the highly sensitive nature of the malegenitalia, and the often associated fear of embar-rassment on behalf of the patient with problemslocalized to this region. Precise diagnosis of acute scrotal problems is not always straightforward; however, differenti-ating true genitourinary (GU) emergencies requir-ingprompt evaluation from urgent conditions safe for outpatient management takes precedenceover definitive diagnosis. The vast majority ofcases of acute testicular pain can be it may threaten testicular viability and futurefertility if not managed swiftly and appropriately.Similarly, early identification and aggressive man-agement of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's disease) is critical. Anatomic essentials The male genitalia is composed of the penis (con- tains the paired erectile bodies and penile vas planes which collectively com-prise the perineum , providing protection and sta- bility to the enclosed structures. However, theseanatomic layers may also provide a conduit forthe rapid spread of infection in certain cases. The scrotal wall contains several layers deep to the epidermis, many of which are contiguous with31 Scrotal pain Jonathan E. Davis, the scrotum.Scrotal pain 462 Primary Complaintsthe penis, perirectal region and anterior abdomi- nal wall. The paired testes are each encapsulatedwithin a dense connective tissue layer termed thetunica albuginea . A break in the integrity of this thick connective tissue represents a \"ruptured\"testicle, as may occur with direct trauma. Externalto the additional stability is scrotal each testicle inferiorly. parietal leafs, with an interposed potentialspace. The significance of this potential space isthat a lack of firm attachment of the testicle to theposterior scrotal wall makes the testes prone torotation in a horizontal plane about the spermatic within tunica vaginalis, The spermatic both the blood supply to each testicle (via thegonadal vessels) and the vas deferens (describedbelow). Interruption of blood flow to the testes bytwisting the spermatic cord, as occurs in testiculartorsion, can lead to rapid ischemia and subsequentinfarction of the affected testicle. The appendix testes are embryologic remnants with no known physi-ologic function located at the uppermost pole ofthe testes. This appendage is prone to torsion aswell, leading to self-limited localized necrosis ofthe appendage. This results in pain which can beconfused with pain due to torsion of the testicle. The epididymis is a fine tubular structure which adheres closely to the posterolateral aspect ofeach testicle. It is involved in promoting spermmaturation and motility. Similar to the appendixtestes, the appendix epididymis is an embryologic remnant with no known function attached to the head of each epididymis. This, too, is prone totorsion, similarly leading to localized necrosis of the appendage. The vas deferens is a tubular structure involved in sperm transit, extendingfrom the epididymis distally to the prostatic por-tion of the urethra proximally. History Adiligent and focused history in the patient presenting with acute scrotal pain is the key to for-mulating an appropriate differential diagnosis andmanagement plan. Acute scrotal complaints willoften include a component of patient embarrass-ment and apprehension; this is especially true inchildren and adolescents. In any situation wherea patient presents with a family member or friend,it is important to offer to speak with the patientalone to ensure patient confidentiality and, insome cases, facilitate a more accurate history. How did the pain begin (sudden versus gradual onset)? Pain that begins abruptly and severely is con- cerning for testicular torsion. The sudden twist-ing of the spermatic cord characteristic of torsionleads to rapid diminution of blood supply to theaffected testicle, causing ischemic pain. This is incontrast to the more indolent and smoldering painof epididymitis, a gradually progressive inflam-matory process. Long-standing inguinal herniasoften present with isolated genital pain that is of prolonged duration. However, incarcerated(unable to reduce) or strangulated (ischemia andinfarction of herniated bowel) hernias may pres-ent in a more dramatic fashion. Is the pain \"constant and progressive\" or \"intermittent and colicky\"? Constant and progressive pain is likely the result of a progressive inflammatory process (such asacute appendicitis); intermittent and colicky painis more consistent with rapid onset and offsetconditions, such as irritation and spasm of hollowstructures (renal and biliary colic) or a twisting mechanism (testicular torsion). As epididymitis isaprogressive inflammatory condition, pain fol- lows in a constant and progressive manner.Patients may exhibit pain with ambulation and movement as a result of the inflammation. Pain of testicular torsion, on the other hand, may beintermittent and colicky, as the spermatic cordmay spontaneously torse and detorse. What were you doing when the pain began? Testicular torsion is often accompanied by an inciting history of minor trauma, leading to rota- tion of the testicle (and twisting of the within the tunica vaginalis. However, testic- ular torsion may occur in the absence of suchevents, and may occur during sleep. It is critical toelicit a history of any blunt or penetrating traumato the scrotum, penis or surrounding structures, asthe differential must then include injuries directlyrelated to such traumatic events. How long has the pain been present? The pain of acute testicular torsion often develops over minutes, whereas pain associated with morePrimary Complaints 463Scrotal painindolent inflammatory conditions such as epi- didymitis develops over several hours to days.Testicular masses, such as testicular cancer, usually progress over several weeks to months. However,a patient with a long-standing testicular tumormay develop acute pain secondary to hemorrhagewithin the tumor, given the rich vascular supplyof such lesions. How would you characterize the pain (dull, aching, sharp, stabbing, throbbing)? The patient's description of the pain may be help- fulin differentiating potential etiologies. Pain associated with epididymitis is often described asdull and aching. Early in the course, pain may bemild, but increases in severity commensurate withworsening inflammation. The sudden pain asso-ciated with testicular torsion, however, is oftendescribed as sharp, stabbing or throbbing. How would you rate the pain on a scale of 0-10, ten being the worst pain you couldever imagine and zero being no pain at all? Patients with testicular torsion often complain ofsevere pain resultant testicular ischemia.Unfortunately, the patient's quantification of painis often inconsistent and generally unreliable innarrowing a differential diagnosis. Indeed, amajority of queried patients convey a \"10 out of10\" response, especially in a highly sensitiveregion such as the genitalia. Given these limita- tions, pain associated with epididymitis andappendage torsion is often less severe in naturewhen compared with that of testicular torsion. Have you ever had similar episodes of pain? Patients with testicular torsion may have had prior episodes of similar pain which resolvedprior to seeking medical care as a result of spon-taneous detorsion. Also, pain of long-standingconditions such as hernias, hydroceles, varicocelesand tumors may present with subacute or chronicpain with intermittent exacerbations. Are there any alleviating or exacerbating factors? Pain resulting from inflammatory processes, such as epididymitis, may be temporarily relieved by rest and scrotal elevation with supportiveundergarments, such as a \"jock-strap.\" Similarly,inflammatory pain is often exacerbated by movement and activity. In contrast, patientsexhibiting the symptoms of testicular torsionoften writhe in pain and cannot find a position ofcomfort. Point with one finger and show me exactly where the pain is located? It is essential to delineate the precise anatomic region(s) where the pain is localized. Pain may be due to structures within or adjoining that particu-lar region, or may be referred from other areas. Themajority of patients with the complaint of acutetesticular pain will have a problem isolated to thegenitalia. Etiologies of referred testicular pain include abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), renalcolic and pyelonephritis. Does the pain move anywhere? It is common for patients with acute scrotal pain from a variety of causes to complain of lowerabdominal, proximal lower extremity (i.e., innerthigh, groin) or back/flank pain. Likewise, it isimportant to consider acute GU pathology in anymale patient presenting with seemingly isolatedpain to the aforementioned anatomic regions.For instance, always consider GU conditions inany male presenting with abdominal pain. Associated symptoms Systemic It is critical to ask about \"systemic\" findings in any patient with an acute scrotum. As a generalrule, males with testicular torsion are more ill- appearing, with associated systemic signs andsymptoms of illness such as nausea and emesis.In comparison, patients with appendage torsionor uncomplicated epididymitis have less severesymptoms. While patients with epididymitis maypresent with a low-grade fever, nausea andmalaise, patients with a more advanced degree ofinfection (known as epididymo-orchitis) often havehigher fever and more \"systemic\" involvement. Urinary Always inquire about changes in urination, includ- ing urgency, frequency, dysuria, hesitancy andhematuria. Urinary symptoms may accompanymany causes of acute testicular pain. Classically,epididymitis may be accompanied by urinarycomplaints. Eliciting the inability to void is alsoimportant, as this may indicate urethral obstruc-tion or severe volume depletion.Genital Ask about reproductive tract symptoms, such as erectile function, penile discharge and ejacula-tory changes. A yellow-green penile dischargemay provide clues to the diagnosis of urethritisor epididymitis, often caused by Gonorrhea and Chlamydia species in sexually active males. Hematospermia may be present in cases of epi-didymitis, as the inflammatory process leads tobreaches in the integrity of the vascular endothe-lium and spilling of blood into the seminal fluid. Gastrointestinal Ask specifically about abdominal or flank pain, nausea, vomiting, distention and bowel changes.One important consideration in the patient withGU complaints and abdominal findings such as pain, distention and constipation/obstipationis an incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernia.Also remember that patients with a retroperi-toneal abdominal process, such as renal colic,pyelonephritis or ruptured AAA, may presentwith pain referred to the ipsilateral testicle withor without associated flank or abdominal pain. Physical examination General appearance The general appearance of a patient providesimportant diagnostic clues. Most often, patientswith testicular torsion are more ill-appearingthan patients with other common scrotal pain. In addition, patients with tes- ticular torsion and renal colic tend to writhe inpain, as they cannot find a position of comfort. Incontrast, patients with progressive inflammatoryconditions such as epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis tend to minimize activity, as even mini-mal movement may exacerbate their discomfort. Vital signs Inflammatory and infectious conditions such asepididymitis, scrotal abscess and Fournier's dis-ease tend to present with fever. However, fever isa very nonspecific finding, as it may be present in varying degrees in a variety of conditions.Abnormalities of other vitals signs may be helpfulin uncovering more advanced stages of diseaseprogression. Hypotension and tachycardia maybe the result of dehydration, sepsis or blood loss(as in the case of a ruptured AAA). Tachycardiaand tachypnea may occur as a consequence ofsubstantial pain, or may signify mor e ominous physiologic derangements. Abdominal Acomplete abdominal examination is crucial in any patient presenting with acute scrotal pain.Many abdominal processes present with a com-ponent of, or even isolated, testicular pain.Always assess for costovertebral angle (CVA)tenderness. CVA tenderness is often present inretroperitoneal processes, such as pyelonephritis, renal colic, and expanding or ruptured AAAs. All of these conditions may present with testicularpain. In addition, it is important to assess for lowerabdominal tenderness or masses, which may bepresent in cases of acute appendicitis, inguinalhernias, GU malignancies, traumatic injuries andspreading infections (i.e., Fournier's disease). Genital It is important to examine the male genitaliawhile the patient is standing and supine. Exercisecaution, however, when examining a standingpatient as some males may experience a strongvagal response to scrotal (or prostate) stimulation,leading to pre-syncope or Also, exami-nation of the testes and epididymis may causesignificant discomfort even in the absence ofpathology. As many patients will have unilaterallocalization of pain, always examine the unaf-fected side first. This serves as a control and willhelp the patient gain confidence and trust (whichmay rapidly wane after examination of a swollenand painful scrotum). Inspection Visual examination of the genitals may reveal cutaneous rashes or lesions, abnormal testicular symmetry or position, edema (evident by loss ofscrotal skin folds) or masses. Key visual features oftesticular torsion include a high-riding testicle anda transverse lie affected testicle, both result-ingfrom twisting of the spermatic cord (Figure 31.2). It is also important to look for evidence ofscrotal or perineal erythema or ecchymoses inolder male patients with scrotal pain. These maybe clues to the presence of Fournier's disease, anecrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Figure 31.3a m ost often af fects dia- betic or other i mmunocompromised patients. A prominent feature of early necrotizing fasci itis is significant pain in the absence of pronouncedphysical findings. Scrotal pain 464 Primary ComplaintsPalpation Differentiating between the etiologies of acute scrotal pain is challenging, as various scrotal con-ditions may present in a similar fashion: unilat-eral (or bilateral) scrotal swelling and testicularenlargement with blurring of the distinctionbetween the testicle and epididymis as a result ofswelling. Often confounding the problem is theexquisite pain and discomfort elicited by theexamination itself. However, there are some find-ings which, if present, may facilitate a more accu-rate diagnosis.If isolated swelling and tenderness of the epi- didymis is present, epididymitis is the likely diag-nosis (Figure 31.4). The natural progression of this infection is first to affect only the epididymis,and then progress to affect the ipsilateral testicleas well (epididymo-orchitis). Isolated nodularityat the superior pole of either the testicle or epi-didymis is often the result of appendage torsion, Primary Complaints 465Scrotal pain Figure 31.2 Testicular torsion. (a) (b) Figure 31.3 (a) Advanced Fournier's disease. Courtesy :Knowledge and Skills Website RCS, Edinburgh. (b) Axial CT section through the groin, showing gas within the and right anatomic location of these structures. Isolated testicular swelling may result from tes-ticular torsion, orchitis or vasculitis (i.e., Henoch-Schonlein is common in inguinal hernias. Swelling surrounding the testicle may be due to a hydroceleor hematocele. Hydroceles result from fluid accu-mulation (or blood in the case of hematoceles) in the tunica vaginalis. A appreci-ated on palpation of the spermatic superior to the testicle. Any testicular nodularity or firm-ness is assumed carcinoma until proven otherwise. Rectal Adigital rectal examination provides information on the prostate and pr ostatic portion of the ure- thra. Exquisite prostate tenderness may indicateacute infection (prostatitis). Prostate firmness andenlargement is a finding in benign prostatic hyper-trophy; nodularity is concerning for prostate carcinoma. These conditions may present withvarying GU symptoms. Special signs/techniques There are several commonly employed adjuncts tothe traditional examination in assessing the maleGU tract. Certain signs, if present, may aid in theproper identification of male genital pathology. The absence of an ipsilateral cremasteric reflex is highly sensitive for the diagnosis of testicular tor-sion (Figure 31.5). This reflex is elicited by strokingthe ipsilateral inner thigh which should result in areflex elevation of the testicle greater than 0.5 cmthrough contraction of the cremaster muscle.Some authors report a high association betweenan absent cremasteric reflex and the diagnosis oftesticular torsion; however, many exceptions exist.Prehn's sign , relief of pain with scrotal elevation, was previously thought to help differentiate epi-didymitis (relieved with scrotal elevation) fromtesticular torsion (no change in symptoms withelevation). However, this sign has been found to beunreliable in distinguishing these two disorders,and its use for this purpose is not recommended. In cases of suspected appendage torsion, assess for the pathognomonic blue dot sign (Figure 31.6). As appendage torsion is most common in the pre-pubescent age group, visualization of the infarctedappendage (the \"blue dot\") is seen through thin,non-hormonally stimulated pre-pubertal skin.Scrotal transillumination should be performed in cases of suspected hydrocele. The scrotal con-tents will transilluminate when filled with light-transmitting fluid, as is the case of a hydrocele.Transillumination, however, is insensitive and not specific for the diagnosis of hydrocele.

Of the potential rapid (often accom-plished in the operating room) must occur inorder to prevent subsequent infarction and necro-sis. Most routine diagnostic aids (such as blood orurine testing) add little to distinguish betweenthe common etiologies of acute scrotal pain.Primary Complaints 469Scrotal painRather, they may actually detract from patient outcome by causing delays in diagnosis. If thehistory and examination suggest the diagnosis of testicular torsion, immediate urology (or gen-eral surgery) consultation and plans for surgicalexploration should be obtained without delay. Apatient of appropriate age with classic historicaland examination findings of testicular torsiondoes not require diagnostic or confirmatory tests.With less distinct circumstances, a confirmatory radiologic study (ultrasound or radionucleotideimaging) is indicated. In cases of Fournier's dis-ease, delays in recognition and definitive surgicaldebridement can be life-threatening. Early con-sultation and administration of broad-spectrumantibiotics is indicated in all suspected cases. Laboratory studies Urinalysis Findings suggestive of a urinary tract infection (pyuria, bacteruria, nitrites, positiveleukocyte esterase) may be present in cases ofepididymitis. Complete blood count An elevated systemic white blood cell (WBC) count may be present in cases of inflammation aswell as infection. Thus, this finding is rather non-specific and does little to narrow the differential.Moreover, obtaining and awaiting results of suchstudies often delays diagnosis and definitivemanagement. However, patients with advancedinfections (scrotal abscess, epididymo-orchitisand Fournier's granulocyte predominance. Radiologic studies Ultrasound Acolor-flow duplex Doppler ultrasound may be helpful in indeterminate cases of acute scrotal pain. The classic finding suggestive of testiculartorsion is blood flow(Figure 31.7). In epididymitis, perfusion will benormal (or possibly increased due to the vaso-dilatory action of inflammatory mediators on localvascular beds). An infarcted appendage may bevisualized on ultrasound as well, if appendagetorsion is responsible for the painful presentation.Ultrasonography may also identify hydroceles,hematoceles, varicoceles, hernias, tumors,abscesses and gonadal vasculitis.Radionucleotide imaging Given the widespread availability and expertise with ultrasound technology, and the inherentrisks associated with radiation exposure, radionu-cleotide pr ocedures are falling out of favor at many centers. With this technique, findings sug-gestive of testicular torsion include diminishedradionucleotide uptake due to compromisedblood flow. Likewise, appendage torsion and epi-didymitis result in preserved (or even increased) uptake compared with the unaffected testicle. Computed tomography Computed tomography (CT) may be helpful in assessing the degree of extension in cases of GUabscess or Fournier's disease. General treatment principles As with any patient presenting to the ED, priori- ties begin with attention to the airway, breathingand circulation (ABCs). The primary goals oftreatment are physiologic stabilization, symptomrelief, administration of antibiotics when indi- cated and, in some cases, preparation for surgicalintervention.

Torsion withinfarction of right was confirmed surgically.Courtesy :R.Brooke Jeffrey, MD.Pain relief Acute scrotal problems encountered in the ED commonly present with a significant (and oftendistressing) component of pain. The greatest pri-ority is identifying GU pathology that necessitatesrapid surgical intervention. Therefore, initial painrelief should be administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM) in order to keep thepatient ready for possible surgical intervention.Under no circumstances should analgesia be with-held pending consultation. If the likelihood of sur-gical intervention is low, and the pain is mild tomoderate on presentation, a trial of oral medica-tions can be offered. Agents used most may berelieved by manual detorsion of the affected testicle. As the testes most frequently torse in a lateral tomedial fashion, it follows that detorsion is accom-plished by rotation of the affected testicle frommedial to lateral. The end point of the detorsionprocedure is relief of pain. Scrotal elevation maybe beneficial in patients with inflammatory condi-tions such as epididymitis. This is easily accom-plished by a towel roll. In addition, ice may reduceedema and provide a mild degree of analgesia. Antibiotics Antimicrobial agents are indicated in cases ofsuspected or proven infectious processes. Earlybroad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is imperativein all cases of suspected Fournier's disease.Suggested regimens include vancomycinplus flagyl in penicillin-allergic patients. Antibio-tics are the cornerstone of therapy for epididymi-tis.Antimicr obial selection is guided by patient demographics: younger, sexually-active malesare treated with Chlamydia trachomatis , such IM with oral doxycycline, or oral ofloxacinalone. Males older than 35 years are treated withagents such as oral fluoroquinolones to covercommon \"urinary\" pathogens ( Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species) most frequently encountered in this demographic group. Also, consider broadercoverage for both coliform and fungal species inmales who practice anal-insertive intercourse.Epididymitis may occur in pre-pubescent males.In this case, the inflammation is often caused byreflux of sterile urine into the epididymis (often the result of minor congenital GU anomalies).Treatment of the resulting \"chemical\" (non-infec- tious) inflammation is with prophylactic oraltrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Special patients Elderly Evaluation and management of elderly maleswith acute scrotal pain follows the same guide-lines as other patients, with a few notable excep-tions. First, accurate historical information may beelusive in patients with age-related cognitiveimpairment. Also, family members and caretakersmay be unaware of complaints and findings asso-ciated with a \"private\" region. In addition, geri- atric patients have relatively limited physiologicreserve, which present management challenges (i.e., effects of administered narcotics, antiemet-ics, IV fluids), challenges in surgical preparation(i.e., need for medical clearance) and diminishedresistance to rapid progression of various disease states. Institutionalized or sedentary patients maypresent with acute symptomotology of chronicGU pathology (such as strangulation of a chronically-incarcerated hernia or coagulopathy- induced bleeding into a hydrocele cavity). An important consideration in any older malepatient with testicular discomfort is pain referredfrom a retroperitoneal process, such as anexpanding or ruptured AAA. Immune compromised Diabetic and other immunocompromised patientsare at increased risk for infections. Be especiallywary of Fournier's disease in these patients.Fournier's presents with significant perineal pain(both resting and on palpation of perineal struc-tures) in the absence of notable scrotal skin pathol-ogy,termed pain \"out of proportion\" to physical examination revealing scrotal ery-thema, ecchymoses or subcutaneous may indi- cate end-stage disease. Pediatric Evaluation and management of the pediatricpopulation presents unique challenges. Pre-verbalchildren may be unable to express the locationand nature of their pain. Completely undress all patients with an unclear presentation or Scrotal pain 470 Primary ComplaintsPrimary Complaints 471Scrotal painuncertain diagnoses. In infants, acute scrotal pain from conditions such as testicular torsionmay be responsible for inconsolable crying. Also, consider sexual abuse in pre-pubescent males presenting with sex ually transmitted infections or GU trauma, such as human \"bite\" marks or con- tusions to the scrotum or perineum. In addition,care must be taken to respect and address privacyissues, especially in the adolescent age group.Likewise, parents may be uncomfortable dis-cussing their child's problem. A useful approachto facilitating a more comprehensive history andexamination is to first interview, examine anddiscuss with the teenage male alone, then offer tospeak with all parties in concert. Disposition There are several urologic emergencies whichrequire immediate evaluation by an appropriate specialist (i.e., urologist or general surgeon) in theED. Emergent conditions discussed in this chap-ter include known or suspected cases of testiculartorsion, Fournier's disease, and AAA. In addition,maintain a very low threshold for consultation inany case of GU trauma (blunt or penetrating). Patients with acute scrotal pain who have been ruled-out for conditions necessitating emer-gent consultation can be referred for urgent pri-mary care or specialty follow-up. Whenever indoubt, err on the side of caution and obtain appro-priate consultation while the patient remains in the ED. Another approach is to obtain urgent follow-up in an appropriate clinic by discussingthe case with the on-call specialist. Always address pain issues by providing options for adequate analgesia, whether thisincludes over-the-counter analgesics or prescrip-tion medications. Also, be certain to provide pre-scriptions for outpatient antimicrobials whenindicated. Patients with unclear diagnoses, intractable pain or vomiting, unreliable follow-up or anunstable social situation may require inpatientmanagement by either a primary care provider(internist, pediatrician, family practitioner) orappropriate specialist.

One in twentyof the population will have a seizure during theirlifetime. This increases to one in eleven if thepatient reaches the age of 80 years. Adults pre-senting to the ED with a first-time seizure accountfor nearly 1% of ED visits annually. Seizures havea bimodal distribution, declining in older child-hood until age 60, when the incidence increasesagain. Febrile seizures occur in approximately3% of children and account for approximately30% of all childhood seizures. Noncompliancewith anticonvulsant medications is the mostcommon cause for seizures in adults less than 60years of age. The most common cause of seizuresin the age group over 60 years is stroke, followedby malignancy. The mortality rate from seizuresis reported between 1% and 10%. The highestmortality is with permanent neurologic sequelae as well. Pathophysiology Aseizure occurs when there is excessive, abnor- mal cortical activity. The clinical manifestationsdepend on the specific area of the brain cortexinvolved. A distinction is often made betweenprimary and secondary seizures. Primary seizures are seizures recurring without consistent provo-cation or cause. Secondary seizures occur as a response to certain toxic, metabolic, or environ- mental events (Table 32.1). Generalized seizures occur from an electrical event that simultan- eously involves both cerebral hemispheres and isaccompanied by loss of consciousness. These can be convulsive ( grand mal seizures) or nonconvul- sive (absence seizures). Partial seizures involve one cerebral hemisphere, and can be divided furtherinto those in which consciousness is maintained(simple partial), and those in which conscious-ness is abnormal (complex partial). Proposed mechanisms for a seizure include the disruption of normal anatomical cortex struc-ture or disruption of local metabolic or biochem-ical function of neuronal cells. Either of thesemechanisms can produce sustained depolariza-tion of neuronal cells, creating an ictogenic focus, followed by recruitment of adjacent cells. Whenthe electrical discharge extends below the cortexto the reticular activating system, consciousnessmay become impaired. Most commonly, seizures 32 Seizures Stephen R. Hayden, MD Table 32.1 Etiology of secondary seizures Metabolic causes Hypoglycemia Hyponatremia/hypernatremia Hypocalcemia/hypomagnesemia Renal failure/dialysis complications High Drugs electrical activ- ityresolving spontaneously. Status epilepticus is defined when the abnormal electrical activity issustained for more than 30-60 minutes withoutan opportunity for recovery between seizureepisodes, which may occur with any type ofseizure. History Do you have a prior history of seizures? The work-up for a patient with an established seizure disorder differs significantly from a patientwho presents with a first-time seizure. New onsetseizures require a more extensive work-up to eval-uate for conditions identified in Table 32.1. How long did the seizure last? How many seizures did you have? This information may need to come from wit- nesses of the event. It may be helpful to ask thepatient \"What is the last thing you rememberclearly before the event?,\" and \"What is the verynext thing you remember clearly after theevent?\" This may give an estimate of the elapsedtime. The duration of the event and whether the seizures were recurrent provide importantinformation to assess the severity of the seizure.Seizures that last more than 30 minutes, or recurwithout clearing of mental status between suc-cessive seizures, define status epilepticus. Has there been a recent change in yourseizure pattern? Asignificant change in seizure pattern would require a work-up similar to that for first-time seizures. Did you hit your head prior to having a seizure? It is important to distinguish between a patient who sustains head trauma followed by a seizurefrom a patient who has a seizure, then falls andhas head trauma. Even in patients with knownseizure disorders, there is higher incidence ofsignificant abnormalities on head computedtomography (CT) in those who hit their headfirst and immediately have a seizure.What medications are you taking? Many medications are associated with seizures at toxic doses. Furthermore, it is important to know ifthe patient is taking any anti-seizure medicationsin order to assess medication levels. Noncompli-ance with anticonvulsants is the most commoncause of recurrent seizures in known epileptics.Use of anticoagulants such as coumadin increasessuspicion for intracranial bleeding. Did you have an aura or premonition prior to the event? Many patients will describe symptoms of pares- thesias, flashing lights, or other visual symptomsimmediately prior to having a seizure. Do you remember what you were doing immediately preceding your loss ofconsciousness? Retrograde amnesia of activities preceding the event is more indicative of a seizure. Did you bite your tongue? Were you incontinent of urine? These are important questions to ask as these findings are more likely associated with a seizure. How long did you feel confused after the event? Apostictal period of around 30 minutes is not unusual after a seizure. If possible, obtain historyfrom the paramedics or other witnesses of theevent. Try to determine if tonic or clonic motoractivity occurred, if the patient maintained con-sciousness during the event, and if there wasfocality to the neurologic symptoms. Do you drink daily, regularly, or heavily? If the answer to any of these is yes, then ask \"When was your last drink?\" Seizures are a common mani- festation of alcohol withdrawal. Furthermore, patients who drink regularly are at greater risk forfalls resulting in chronic subdural hematomas orhyponatremia. Do you use street/recreational drugs? Common drugs abuse such as cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, phencyclidine (PCP), andecstasy may induce seizures.Primary Complaints 475SeizuresAssociated symptoms Associated symptoms often include hypertension, tachycardia, muscle soreness, and headache. Elicitsymptoms of pain or soreness after the seizure. Aposterior shoulder dislocation, often not discov- ered until several days after the event, is com-monly missed following a prolonged tonic-clonicseizure. Past medical It is important to ascertain a prior history of renalor liver disease, malignancy, diabetes, cardiovas-cular disease, hypertension, human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) risk factors, drug or alcoholabuse, recent trauma, degenerative central ner-vous system (CNS) diseases, prior neurosurgery,psychiatric history, family history of seizures,and pregnancy, as they all are associated withsecondary seizures. Physical examination The primary purpose of the physical examin-ation is to evaluate for focal neurologic deficits orother signs that might suggest a secondary causefor seizures. General appearance Many times the physical examination is normalin the seizure patient. Of primary importance inthe immediate postictal period is to evaluatewhether the patient is adequately protecting the airway. Level of consciousness will often bedepressed; therefore, evaluate and maintainpatency of the airway. On occasion, patients maybleed profusely from oral trauma, requiring thatthe airway be secured. Also take note if thepatient was incontinent of urine, as this may sup-port the diagnosis of a seizure. The postictal state is often characterized by decreased responsiveness, disorientation,amnesia, and headache. The mental status exam-ination should slowly improve over time, rang-ing from a few moments to an hour or more. Thismay not be consistent between patients or evenbetween seizures in the same patient. If mentalstatus does not improve appropriately, thisshould prompt further investigation. Somepatients in nonconvulsive status are mistakenlyassumed to be postictal instead of actively seizing.Vital signs Following a seizure, patients are frequentlyhypertensive, tachycardic, tachypneic, and mayhave lowered oxygen saturation. These abnor-malities should improve as the patient recovers.Mild hyperthermia may occur, but a significantlyelevated temperature or persistently abnormalvital signs should prompt further investigationfor a secondary cause of the seizure. Head and neck Head and neck examination should focus on iden-tifying signs of head trauma such as cephalohe-matoma, depressed skull fracture, lacerations andabrasions, and hemotympanum. Pupils should beevaluated for reactivity and symmetry, and cranialnerve abnormalities should be sought. Anisocoriamay suggest impending herniation through theforamen magnum. Nystagmus, especially rotary,is associated with certain drugs such as PCP .Persistent eye deviation may indicate ongoingseizure activity. The oropharynx must be exam-ined for signs of oral trauma. The presence of abite mark to the lateral tongue strongly suggeststhat a seizure occurred. The finding of oralthrush may suggest that the patient is immuno-compromised. Automatisms (repetitive actions such as lip smacking, swallowing, or chewing)are frequent in complex partial seizures and maybe the only indication of ongoing seizure activity.The cervical spine should be palpated for mid-line tenderness or deformity. If there is no evidence of neck trauma, the neck should beevaluated for meningismus. Pulmonary Pulmonary examination should assess sym-metry and character of breath sounds, lookingfor aspiration that may have occurred during theseizure. Neurogenic pulmonary edema can occurfollowing a seizure, but is usually mild and self-limited. It is characterized by diffuse crackles,hypoxia, and the absence of signs of congestiveheart failure. Cardiovascular Cardiac examination may reveal a heart murmurand might indicate subacute bacterial endocarditis(SBE) with resultant embolization as the cause ofthe seizure. An irregular heart rate or carotid bruitsmay accompany a stroke, which is a commoncause of new-onset seizures in the elderly.Seizures 476 Primary ComplaintsNeurologic Adetailed neurologic examination must be per- formed. The patient should be carefully assessed for focal motor or sensory deficits, and abnor-malities of cerebellar function. Postictal paralysis(Todd's paralysis) may follow generalized orpartial seizures. This is typically characterized byweakness of one extremity or complete hemipare-sis. Symptoms may persist for up to 24 hours.Todd's paralysis indicates a higher likelihood of an underlying structural cause for the seizure, andshould therefore be investigated. Tremulousnessof the extremities and tongue, in conjunction withother stigmata of ethanol abuse, suggest an alcoholwithdrawal seizure. Extremities Examination of the extremities may demonstrateevidence of trauma. Particular attention shouldbe paid to identifying shoulder dislocations(seizures are a common cause of posterior shoul-der dislocations). Skin The skin should be examined for lesions consistentwith infections, such as meningococcemia or SBE(splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, Osler'snodes). Evidence of underlying liver disease orcoagulopathy should be sought. Similarly, skinlesions such as neurocutaneous disorder. Needle tracksindicate IV drug use, which may indicate a toxi-cologic or infectious etiology for seizures. Differential diagnosis Even when witnessed, other abnormal states ofconsciousness can produce twitching or jerkingmovements that can be difficult to distinguishfrom a seizure. In 40-50% of cases of vasovagalsyncope (fainting), brief twitching movementsoccur. Generally the tonic or clonic movementsassociated with a seizure are much more forcefuland prolonged, and associated with a postictalstate, urinary incontinence, and tongue bitingthat does not typically occur in fainting. Other causes of sudden loss of consciousness that resemble a seizure include hyperventilationsyndrome, prolonged breath-holding spells ininfants, and causes of syncope (Table 32.2). Extrapyramidal reactions, Table 32.2 Differential diagnosis of seizure Diagnosis Classic symptoms Signs Work-up Breath-holding Usually brought on by anger, fear, frustration Normal neurologic ECG to check QT spells in Pallor or cyanotic spells examination intervalinfants Apnea or bradycardia EEG during spells Extrapyramidal Tongue deviation Level of consciousness Clinical diagnosis reactions Torticollis usually maintained in setting of Jerking, random limb movements taking specific History of taking phenothiazines/ medications butyrophenones Hyperventilation Shortness of breath followed by rate clinicalsyndrome paresthesias, carpopedal spasm Normal neurologic examination diagnosis, ABG and loss of consciousness may be useful Psychogenic May closely mimic symptoms Usually quick return to Continuous EEGseizures of true seizure normal mental status monitoring during Often in the setting of post-event events emotional distress TIA/CVA Sudden onset of weakness, Abnormal neurologic Head CT, ECG, difficulty speaking, or walking findings laboratories Vasovagal Brief twitching movements No postictal state ECG, glucose syncope Classic prodrome of lightheadedness, Lack of tongue biting testing, tunnel vision test children, may be confused with seizure activity. Psychogenic states, in particular pseudoseizures, may be difficult to differentiatefrom true seizure activity. Continuous EEG moni-toring during such episodes may be necessary tomake a correct diagnosis. Diagnostic testing The diagnostic work-up for patients presenting tothe ED with seizures depends on whether it was afirst-time seizure, what underlying conditions thepatient may have, and whether a clear seizureprecipitant (hypoglycemia, hypoxia, intoxication,withdrawal state) is identified (Figure 32.1). Laboratory studies Complete blood count The complete blood count (CBC) is rarely useful in a seizure patient. The white blood cell (WBC)count is often elevated from demargination dur-ing the seizure. However, a CBC is often orderedin patients presenting with a seizure when themental status is not returning to normal, the patienthas HIV or is immunosuppressed (to determinethe absolute neutrophil count), in patientswith platelet or abnormal-ities. In febrile patients, including young childrenwith a febrile seizure, a CBC may be ordered aspart of the evaluation for the underlying source ofinfection. Electrolytes Electrolytes, especially sodium, calcium, and magnesium, are indicated for patients with a first-time seizure, or alcoholics who likely have nutri-tional deficiencies. Additionally, any patient inwhich the mental status is not returning to normalafter a seizure should have electrolytes checked aspart of the work-up. Children less than 1 year ofage who have had a seizure in the absence of fevershould also have electrolytes checked. Glucose All patients presenting with a seizure should have rapid glucose determination performed. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis Alumbar puncture (LP) is indicated in a seizure patient when the mental status fails to return tonormal after seizure, if a subarachnoid hemor- rhage is suspected (sudden onset of worst headache in conjunction with a seizure), or whena CNS infection is suspected (patients with fever,headache, or stiff neck). In addition, cerebrospinalfluid (CSF) analysis may be helpful for HIV orimmunocompromised patients who are at riskfor opportunistic CNS infections that may onlybe diagnosed by analyzing the CSF. CSF analysismay also be helpful for the evaluation of a febrileinfant who has had a seizure. Traditionally, an LPwas recommended for a febrile seizure in the agegroup less than 12 months. However, newer evidence-based guidelines suggest that forinfants with a febrile seizure, if the infant other-wise appears well and there is no history ofrecent antibiotic use, a routine LP is not indi- cated. If the child appears ill, or the mental statusis not returning to normal, an LP should be performed. Anticonvulsant levels Anticonvulsant levels are indicated in seizure patients who report taking medications for whicha therapeutic level can be determined. Toxicology screening Toxicology screening should be performed when the mental status is not returning to normal after a seizure. In the setting of specific toxic exposuresfor which toxin levels can be determined (e.g.,carbon monoxide), toxicologic screening may alsobe useful. For first-time seizures, if the patientcan provide an appropriate history, routine toxi-cology screening is of little value. Creatine phosphokinase Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels may be important to determine in patients with status epilepticus, seizures resulting from toxic inges-tions (especially sympathomimetics), or a pro-longed downtime before coming to the ED. Pregnancy testing Pregnancy testing should be performed in any woman of childbearing age in whom the mentalstatus does not return to baseline after the seizure.Additionally, pregnancy testing may be performedprior to initiating any new medications if there isa possibility the patient may be pregnant.Seizures 478 Primary Complaints First-time seizure: mental status returning to baseline Serum glucose, sodium and calcium levels, CTSerum glucose, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, magnesium CT if returning to baselineHistory of alcoholismKnown seizure disorder: mental status not returning to normal or abnormal seizure patternKnown seizure disorder: mental status returning to normal and normal seizure patternFebrile seizure Serum glucose 32.1 for the evaluation of the patient with seizures . Adapted from Bradford JC, Kyriakedes CG. Evaluation of the patient wit h seizures: an evidence based approach. Emerg Med Coagulation studies should be performed if the patient with a seizure has a known coagulationdisorder, is on anticoagulant medication, or hasany condition that might be expected to altercoagulation parameters (i.e., liver disease oralcoholism). Radiologic studies Computed tomography CT should be performed in any patient with a first-time seizure, a patient in whom the mentalstatus fails to return to normal post-seizure, inthe setting of neonatal seizures without fever,seizures following head trauma, patients withcoagulation disorders or on anticoagulants, malig-nancy, or patients with an abnormal neurologic examination. Appropriate timing of the head CTis discussed in a subsequent section. Other studies An electroencephalogram (EEG) can be performedas part of the work-up of a seizure as an outpatientfor first-time seizures, or more emergently at thebedside when the mental status does not return tonormal (to evaluate for nonconvulsive statusepilepticus). EEG is necessary in the setting ofrefractory status epilepticus requiring general anesthesia and paralysis or barbiturate coma. An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be per- formed if the seizure is believed to be due to drugor toxin exposure, or if the patient has underlyingcomorbid conditions that increase the risk ofcoronary artery disease or dysrhythmias. Summary of diagnostic considerations for certain types ofseizures For first-time seizures without an obvious cause, with mental status returning to normal, current evidence-based guidelines suggest that serumglucose, sodium and calcium levels be obtained,and a head CT be performed. An LP needs to beperformed only if an adult has a fever without anobvious source, or to evaluate for possible subarachnoid hemorrhage. The question ariseswhether the head CT needs to be performed during the ED visit. The decision must be basedon the patient's current condition, access to med-ical care, reliability of follow-up and their abilityto understand the nature of their medical condi-tion and follow-up instructions. It is often expedi- tious to perform a head CT in the ED. If themental status does not return to normal, then theabove work-up should also include a CBC, alco-hol/ toxicology screening, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/ cr eatinine, magnesium level, ECG, preg- nancy test, and arterial blood gas (ABG)/car-boxyhemoglobin level if clinically warranted. Inthis case, a head CT should be performed urgentlyin the ED. Although unlikely, an EEG may be per-formed if available. For patients with a known seizure disorder , typ- ical seizure pattern, and mental status returningto normal, rapid glucose testing and serum anti-convulsant levels are recommended. For a knownseizure patient that has an abnormal seizure pat-tern or mental status that does not return to nor-mal, the work-up is the same as for a first-timeseizure patient whose mental status is not return-ing to normal. For a known alcoholic in whom an alcohol with- drawal seizure is suspected and mental status is returning to baseline, rapid glucose determina- tion and anticonvulsant levels may be performedif the patient takes such medications. Routinelaboratory testing is usually unnecessary unlessperformed for a more generalized health statusevaluation or if the patient has significant comor-bidities. If there is concomitant evidence of headtrauma, a head CT is indicated. If the mental sta-tus is not returning to normal, the work-upshould proceed as for a first-time seizure patientwhose mental status is not returning to normal. Febrile seizures in the pediatric population are relatively common occurrences, especially if there is a history of febrile seizures in a first-degree relative. For an otherwise healthy, well-appearing child with a febrile seizure, serumglucose testing should be obtained, and otherdiagnostic tests to evaluate for an occult source offever (CBC, cultures, urinalysis (UA) andculture, and studies)should be considered. Traditionally, some author-ities have r ecommended LP for children less than 12 months old, and as an option in children lessthan 18 months. Current evidence-based guidelines, however, do not recommend routine LP for febrileseizures unless the patient has a history of recent antibi-otic use. If a child appears ill or mental status is not improving after the febrile seizure, a compre-hensive fever work-up including LP is warranted in addition to consideration for the tests outlinedfor a first-time seizure patient whose mental sta-tus is not returning to normal.Seizures 480 Primary ComplaintsNeonatal seizures without fever need to have a variety of diagnostic tests performed, including serum glucose, electrolytes, BUN/creatinine, calcium/magnesium levels, and head CT if thechild is less than 1 year old. Anumber of conditions deserve special con- sideration in the setting of a seizure. If the patienthas a history or findings of coagulopathy, plateletdisorders, or is taking anticoagulant medication,the work-up should include a CBC, coagulationstudies, and head In patients with history ofrenal failure, BUN/creatinine and electrolytes should be tested. Patients who are known or sus-pected HIV positive or immunosuppressedshould have a CBC, head CT, and LP performed.For toxic exposures or ingestions, consider anECG, specific drug, alcohol, and acetaminophen/salicylate levels, and toxicology screens. Patientswith a history of malignancy or recent headtrauma should have a head CT performed. General treatment principles Status epilepticus Status epilepticus is a life-threatening emergency with potential for airway compromise, severehypoxia, and neurologic injury. Whether theseizure activity is continuous or recurrent with-out clearing of the mental state, assume the air-way is compromised. Active measures should betaken to secure it. Placing the patient in the leftlateral decubitus position, removing dentures,and carefully suctioning vomit and saliva areappropriate initial steps. If the airway cannot beadequately protected by these simple measures,endotracheal intubation may be necessary. Arapid-acting benzodiazepine (such as midazo-lam) is a good choice as the induction agent, as itmay terminate seizure activity. If tonic activity ortrismus prevents adequate opening of the mouth,paralytics may be necessary. Bear in mind thatonce the patient is paralyzed, tonic-clonic activ-ity will cease but the abnormal cortical neuronalactivity may continue (i.e., the patient continuesto seize without the muscular activity). Second-or third-line anticonvulsants may be necessary,and EEG monitoring will be required as soon aspractical. Status epilepticus is often the result of a sec- ondary cause for seizures (Table 32.1). These con-ditions may be rapidly reversible and must bediagnosed early and corrected immediately (i.e.,hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hypoxia).Structural abnormalities (i.e., subarachnoid orintracranial hemorrhage) and toxic states may bepresent; these conditions should be consideredearly and appropriate management instituted(e.g., isoniazid (INH) overdose would be managedwith pyridoxine). Concomitant with the work-upfor these diseases, abortive therapy may be insti-tuted using the medications indicated below. Pharmacologic abortive seizure therapy In general, the first-line medication for terminating seizure activity in the ED is intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) benzodiazepines (Table 32.3).IV access must be established if not alreadyaccomplished. It should be noted that diazepamcan be administer ed via an endotracheal tube, rec- tally, or thr ough gamma amino butyric acid(GABA)-mediated inhibition and are effective in terminating seizures in 80-90% of cases. Diazepam,lorazepam, and midazolam are common medica-tions used in the ED to abort seizures because oftheir rapid onset and efficacy. There have beenno compelling studies in an ED population thatclearly establish the superiority of one of thesemedications over the other. Common second-line pharmacologic agents used in the ED for pro-phenytoin drug fosphenytoin) phenytoin may too rapidly IV . Fosphenytoin can beadministered quickly IV without deleteriouseffect, and has the additional advantage of IMadministration if IV access is a problem. The costdifferential, however, may keep fosphenytoinfrom replacing phenytoin as a second-line agent.Phenobarbital is a CNS depressant that decreasesneuronal electrical activity at the seizure focus aswell as terminates recruitment. Most experiencewith phenobarbital as a second-line agent to ter-minate seizures is in the pediatric population.Barbiturates have the adverse effects of sig-nificant sedation, hypotension, and respiratorydepression; therefore, patients must be moni-tored closely. If seizure activity is not suppressed by the above measures, additional therapeutic options in theED include using valproate, barbiturate coma, orPrimary parenteral form exists(Depacon). A recent meta-analysis, however, foundthat there are certain risks associated with IVDepacon, including neurotoxicity, and it must beadministered over 60 minutes. This review con-cluded that the evidence is too limited to routinelyrecommend IV valproate unless it is not desirable to induce a barbiturate coma or begin inhalationalanesthesia. The typical agent used barbiturate also induces respiratory depression/arrest andcauses hypotension, so patients must be intubatedand monitored closely. Isoflurane inhalational anesthesia is another option for seizure activity that does not respondto first- or second-line agents, or treatment elec-trical seizure foci and is titratable. It is preferred that patients are intubated to protect their airwaybefore instituting isoflurane anesthesia to termin-ate seizures. Inhalational anesthesia is usually reserved for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) or operating room unless there will bea significant delay in transferring the patient tothese settings.Special patients Pediatric The work-up of a child with a febrile seizure hasbeen discussed. Remember that febrile seizures areassociated more with the rapidity of temperaturerise, not the absolute temperature. In determiningwhat work-up to do for a child with febrile seizure,the clinician should be guided by the generalappearance of the child, and consider the underly-ing cause of the fever. Generally, anticonvulsanttherapy is not instituted for simple febrile seizures.It is important to educate parents on appropriatetemperature control measures, including alternat-ing doses of acetaminophen (15-20 (5-10 mg/kg/dose PO every Additionally, the child can have frequentsponge baths with tepid water, as this is a veryeffective cooling measure. In children with afebrile seizures, many of the same diagnostic and therapeutic considerationsare present as with adults. Two special causes ofchildhood seizures are worth mentioning. The firstis the \"morning after\" seizure caused by drinkingalcohol left within reach of children at a party, lead-ing to hypoglycemia and seizures. Another causeof hypoglycemia-induced seizures in children isTable 32.3 Pharmacologic treatment of seizures Drug Adult dose Pediatric dose Diazepam 5-10 mg IV every 5-10 minutes 0.2-0.5 IV (maximum 4 mg)Midazolam 2.5-15 mg IV or IM (unpredictable 0.15 mg/kg IV then drip 2-10 mcg/kg/minute or absorption IM) 0.15 mg/kg IM (unpredictable absorption) Phenytoin 1 gm IV load at 50 mg/minute 20 mg/kg IV at 1 mg/kg/minuteFosphenytoin 15-20 single IV first 1-2 hours then 10-15 mg / kg IV first 1 - 2 hours then 1mg/kg/hour IV 1 mg/kg/hour IV Valproate 20 mg/kg PR or 15 mg/kg IV 20 mg/kg PR or 15 mg/kg IV (maximum 250 mg) ComplaintsTable 32.4 Pediatric seizures in children Seizure type Clinical findings Work-up and management Febrile Age less than 5 years CBC, blood cultures, UA, CXR if indicated seizure Well appearing to evaluate for underlying infection Lack of signs of serious bacterial illness LP if recent antibiotic course (some Normal neurologic examination recommend LP routinely for age /H110211 year) Morning after Ambulatory child drinks leftover alcohol from a History is key, parental education seizure party and becomes hypoglycemic and seizes Ketotic Children 6-18 months Rapid glucose testing hypoglycemia Periods of caloric deprivation lead to profound Urine dipstick for ketones hypoglycemia Consider chemistry panel Absence Staring episodes Electrolytes, glucose seizures Automatisms Head CT (or MRI) Appear awake but are not responsive EEGNo postictal period Infantile History of congenital abnormality or perinatal Head CT (or MRI) spasms brain injury Electrolytes, glucose Myoclonic seizures in clusters EEG (high voltage chaotic slowing, Development delay hypsarrythmia)Age less than 1 year Status Seizure activity for /H1102230 minutes Head CT, electrolytes, glucose, CBC, epilepticus Series of seizures, mental status does not return toxicology screening, ECG and EEG to normal between events CBC: cause abnormally low blood glucose levels and seizures. This occurs in young childrenbetween 6 and 18 months of age when the inter-val between feedings is increased. The diagnosisis suggested in the ED when typical symptomsoccur, and hypoglycemia and ketonuria are pres-ent (Table 32.4). Alcoholic Chronic alcohol use stimulates GABA enhance-ment. Alcohol withdrawal seizures may haveonset 6 hours or more after abrupt cessation ofdrinking. They are typically generalized andrecurrent. With each episode of alcohol cessation, the seizure threshold may decrease, increasingthe risk and severity of seizures. Other symp-toms include those associated with autonomicinstability, such as tachycardia, hypertension,mild hyperthermia, and CNS activation includ-ing tremor and jerking movements. If thepatient's mental status is significantly altered orconfused, delirium tremens ensues. This carries a mortality rate as high as 20-30% in some series.Alcoholics are at risk for other secondary causesof seizures, such as hypoglycemia, intracranialbleeding, other drugs/toxins, and electrolytedisturbances (especially hypomagnesemia orhypocalcemia). Treatment of alcohol withdrawalseizures includes benzodiazepines (often in highdoses), which substitute for the GABA-enhancingeffect of ethanol. Most patients with alcoholwithdrawal seizures do not need second-linetreatments such as phenytoin. Pregnant Seizures in pregnancy are generally of two cat-egories: gestational , in which underlying seizure disorder or anticonvulsant levels are adverselyimpacted by hormonal and metabolic changes ofpregnancy; eclampsia, associated with proteinuria, edema,and seizures. Eclampsia generally occurs after the20th week of pregnancy . The likelihood decreases after delivery, though seizures may occur days to weeks after delivery. It may not be obvious,however, that a woman is more than 20 weekspregnant, so all women of childbearing age Primary Complaints 483Seizurespresenting in status epilepticus should be evalu- ated for pregnancy. The treatment of seizures inthe setting of eclampsia is controversial; special-ists in obstetrics or perinatology should be con-sulted early. In addition to the same managementconsiderations for patients in status epilepticus previously outlined, high-dose parenteral magne- sium sulfate therapy (4 g IV bolus followed by2g/hour infusion) has traditionally been used to help control seizure symptoms. Careful monitor-ing of respiratory status and reflexes is essentialwhen giving magnesium. Cerebral arterial gas embolism (CAGE) When the cerebral circulation is showered withair bubbles, a common manifestation is the abruptonset of a seizure. In self-contained underwaterbreathing apparatus (SCUBA) divers, rapidascent from depth while holding their breathmay lead to pulmonary overinflation, tear of thebronchoalveolar sheath and air entering the pul-monary venous system, return of air to the leftside of the heart and systemic embolization of airbubbles. The hallmark of cerebral arterial gasembolism (CAGE) is the abrupt loss of conscious-ness with the onset of seizures or other neuro-logic symptoms upon surfacing. On the otherhand, decompression sickness typically has alatent period before the development of neuro-logic symptoms and does not usually presentwith seizures. Other causes of CAGE includepulmonary overinflation from positive pressureventilation, air entry during catheterization orother vascular procedures, brain surgery, cardiacsurgery, and cardiopulmonary bypass. Therehave even been reports of CAGE from inhalingdirectly from a helium tank and vaginal insuffla-tion during pregnancy. The abrupt appearance ofany new neurologic symptoms, including seizures,during any of the above activities or proceduresshould prompt investigation for pulmonaryoverinflation injury and CAGE. The definitivetreatment for CAGE is hyperbaric oxygen ther-apy. The patient should be placed on 100% oxy-gen until arrangements can be made with thehyperbaric consulting service. Pseudoseizures It can be difficult at times to differentiate betweentrue seizures and pseudoseizures. Events oftenoccur in the setting of emotional distress. Pseu-doseizures are characterized by palpitations,choking sensations, dizziness, malaise, sensorydisturbances, crying, and alterations in conscious-ness with or without motor manifestations. Unliketrue seizures, motor activity generally consists ofside-to-side head movements, opisthotonus,pelvis thrusting, trembling, and random incontinence andpostictal may occur; however, thepostictal period is often short. Pseudoseizurestend to be more gradual in evolution and longerin duration. Some patients can be very skilled atmimicking the tonic-clonic activity of a seizure.In a few cases, patients can be startled out ofpseudoseizure activity or may respond to noxiousstimuli such as ammonia capsules. Ultimately,pseudoseizures are diagnosed when normal EEGactivity is documented during apparent seizureactivity. Disposition Patients with status epilepticus, mental statusexaminations that do not return to normal, orseizures associated with serious underlyingmedical conditions should be admitted to a moni-tored setting and given first- and often second-line medications to suppress seizures. Most otherseizure patients can be managed in the outpa-tient setting, with close follow-up and supportfrom family or friends. Patients with a first-time seizure in whom the work-up does not identify a serious underlyingmedical condition can be discharged with closefollow-up. The question arises whether to insti-tute anticonvulsant therapy after a first-timeseizure. Factors that increase the risk of recurrentseizures include EEG abnormalities (though thisdiagnostic test is infrequently obtained in theED), partial versus generalized seizures, recur-rent seizures in the ED, history of intracranial surgery or head trauma, and persistent neurologicabnormality such as Todd's paralysis. Thesepatients might be candidates for initiating seizuremedications after a first episode. This is oftendone in consultation with an on-call neurologist or the patients' primary care provider, if available. The side effects of anticonvulsants are numer- ous; some patients cannot tolerate them, and manydrug interactions may occur. In the absence offactors that are likely to predict recurrent seizures,and if provoking factors are easily managed (i.e., hypoglycemia), anticonvulsant therapy aftera first-time seizure is not indicated. In patientswith a known seizure disorder, anticonvulsantSeizures 484 Primary Complaintslevels should be checked and managed appropri- ately in consultation with the physician responsi-ble for those medications, if possible. Many states have mandatory reporting laws for any episode of sudden lapse of consciousness,including seizures. Physicians should followstate laws regarding this, and advise patients notto drive or engage in activities that might be haz-ardous if a seizure were to recur. It is reasonableto document that this activity was reported. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths The most common cause of recurrentprimary seizures is subtherapeuticanticonvulsant levels; check anticonvulsantlevels in a patient with a history of seizures. Since the most common cause of secondaryseizures is hypoglycemia, rapid glucosedetermination is important for all seizurepatients. Benzodiazepines are the first-line treatmentfor seizures or status epilepticus in the ED.They can be administered via multiple routes. U rgent neuroimaging is recommended for patients with first-time seizures, suspicion ofhead trauma or increased ICP , intracranialmass or history of cancer, persistentlyabnormal mental status, focal neurologicdeficit, underlying HIV or otherimmunocompromising diseases, or inpatients taking anticoagulant medications. For otherwise healthy, well-appearing children with a febrile seizure, someauthorities recommend LP for all childrenless than 12 months old; however, currentevidence-based guidelines suggest that an LPis necessary only if there is clinical suspicionfor a CNS infection, or if the child has ahistory of recent antibiotic use. It is not always easy to distinguish a seizurefrom syncope. Seizure activity is suggestedby retrograde amnesia, incontinence, tongue biting,and prolonged postictal state.Alcoholics are at higher risk of falls,electrolyte abnormalities, and hypoglycemia.Patients with alcohol withdrawal and aseizure must be carefully evaluated for thesesecondary conditions before concluding thatthe seizure is simply the result of thewithdrawal state. Patients that have required intubation and neuromuscular blockade may still beseizing at the neuronal level. Furtherinvestigation must be performed todetermine if seizure activity continues, suchas a bedside EEG. The appearance of new neurologic symptomsor seizure activity in a SCUBA diver, apatient who is intubated on positive-pressureventilation, or after vascular proceduresshould prompt investigation for CAGE. Follow mandatory reporting laws for allpatients experiencing any episode of loss ofconsciousness, including a seizure.

Dyspneic patientsoften say they feel like they are being smothered,cannot catch their breath, or are unable to getenough air. Dyspnea is a symptom associated with many disorders, from nonurgent to life-threatening.Like the perception of pain, dyspnea is subjectiveand its severity does not necessarily correlate withthe seriousness of the underlying pathology. The chief complaint \"shortness of breath\" is encountered in about 3% of all emergencydepartment (ED) patients. Approximately two-thirds of these patients have an underlying car-diac or pulmonary disorder. Specific data on thegeneral prevalence of dyspnea is not available,although in the Framingham study, 6-27% of theadult population reported experiencing dys-pnea. In some patient populations (e.g., oncologypatients), the prevalence of dyspnea may bemuch higher. Pathophysiology In general, breathing is a well-synchronized,unconscious, quiet and effortless process.Dyspnea results when ventilatory demandexceeds respiratory function. Although the exactmechanism responsible for dyspnea is unknown,abnormalities or alterations of gas exchange, pul-monary circulation, cardiovascular function, respiratory mechanics, or the oxygen (O 2) carrying capacity of blood may result in dyspnea. Respirations are generally \"automatic\" and under the control of the respiratory centers in thecentral nervous system (CNS) (e.g., medulla/pons).Respirations are regulated by various afferentinput from mechanoreceptors in the lungs, airways and respiratory muscles, as well as chemoreceptors in the blood (e.g., aortic and carotid bodies) andbrain. These chemoreceptors sense changes in theblood pH, partial pressures of O 2(PO 2) and carbon dioxide (PCO 2), then transmit signals back to the central respiratory center. Here, therate of ventilation is adjusted to maintain bloodgas and acid-base homeostasis. Feedback frommechanoreceptors regarding the mechanical sta-tus and function of the ventilatory pump and res-piratory muscles leads to adjustment of the leveland pattern of breathing. The efferent nervepathway to the muscles of respiration starts inthe brainstem (medulla/pons), crosses over andthen travels in the contralateral spinal cord toreach the spinal motor neurons. Respirations are also subject to voluntary con- trol through input from the cerebral cortex to therespiratory centers in the medulla/pons. Of all the vital signs, respiratory rate is the only vitalsign which can be influenced by voluntary con-trol, although to a limited extent. During \"normal\" respiration, the main work of breathing is done by the diaphragm and inter-costal muscles. When a patient experiences respi-ratory distress, contraction of the intercostalmuscles becomes more forceful and visible to theobserver. This condition is referred to as \"inter-costal retractions\" or \"retractions.\" In this situ-ation, the patient is said to be \"retracting.\"Retractions may also occur in the supraclavicularand substernal areas. When there is increasedwork of breathing or r espiratory distress, other muscles are recruited in an ef fort to maintain the movement of air in the lungs. When the neckmuscles are recruited, their contractions becomeevident. This is described as when theabdominal muscles recruited. Marked move-ments of the abdomen and paradoxical chestwall motion may also occur. History If dyspnea is not due to an immediate life-threat,the history and physical examination can pro-ceed in an orderly fashion. Immediate resuscita-tion must occur if the shortness of breath is fromrespiratory failure, shock with inadequate tissue perfusion, or hypoxia at a cellular level. The his-tory is critical in the evaluation of dyspnea in33 Shortness of breath in adults Sharon E. Mace, MDShortness of breath in adults 486 Primary Complaintsorder to differentiate life-threatening from benign causes, and in determining its etiology. How did the shortness of breath begin (sudden or gradual onset)? The acute onset of dyspnea raises concern for disorders such as spontaneous pneumo-thorax, pulmonary embolism (PE), acute coronarysyndrome (ACS), acute pulmonary edema, oranaphylaxis. Gradual onset of shortness ofbreath in a patient may represent pneumonia,congestive heart failure (CHF), reactive airwaydisease (RAD), or malignancy. However, vari-ation occurs in these classic presentations. Have you had shortness of breath before? Previous episodes of dyspnea suggest a chronic cardiac or pulmonary disorder such as asthma,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),or CHF. Asthma is the most likely diagnosis in achild or nonsmoking adult who experienceschronic symptoms of shortness of breath whichwax and wane, especially if wheezing is present.COPD should be considered in an adult smokerwith recurrent episodes of dyspnea. In an adultwith dyspnea and bilateral lower extremityedema, CHF should be considered. Apatient with \"chronic\" shortness of breath (for months or years) may present with an acuteexacerbation of dyspnea. This is often the casewith COPD or CHF. The physician needs todetermine what caused the sudden worsening ofsymptoms, such as medication noncompliance,pulmonary infection in a COPD patient, changein diet (e.g., increased salt intake in a CHF patient),or cardiac ischemia or myocardial infarction (MI). Does anything make the shortness of breath better or worse? Orthopnea is dyspnea that is worse with lying down and better with sitting or standing. Typically, CHF and pulmonary edema are associated withorthopnea. Orthopnea is also one of the earliestfindings in patients diaphragmatic weak-ness from neuromuscular disorders. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) refers to the patient waking up suddenly at night with acute short-ness of breath. In patients with CHF, this is dueto the accumulation of fluid in the lungs whilethe patient lays flat and sleeps. As a result ofPND or orthopnea, patients may sleep sitting in achair or with multiple pillows under their headin order to avoid becoming dyspneic. Trepopnea is dyspnea associated with a unilateral recumbentposition, and may occur in patients with unilat-eral lung disease, ball-valve airway obstruction,diaphragmatic paralysis, or COPD. Do you have chest pain? Chest pain associated with dyspnea suggests a serious underlying disorder, such as ACS or PE.Sharp chest pain worsened by breathing but notby movement suggests a PE or spontaneouspneumothorax. Do you have palpitations or feel an abnormal heartbeat? Palpitations or an irregular heartbeat felt by the patient generally signifies a cardiac etiology forthe dyspnea, particularly if new. A dyspneicpatient was beat-ing a beat,\" or \"beatingfunny\" suggests a dysrhythmia. Do you have swelling of the lower extremities? Is it difficult for the patient to put on their shoesbecause of edematous feet? Bilateral lower extrem- CHF, whileunilateral lower extremity swelling with calf painis suspicious for a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).Patients with a DVT in the lower extremity mayhave pain and swelling in that calf. Dyspnea in apatient with a known DVT or unilateral legswelling is worrisome for a clot that has brokenoff from the leg and embolized to the lung (PE). Do you feel faint or did you pass out? Adyspneic patient who passed out (syncope) or almost passed out (near-syncope) may have sig- nificant cardiac (ACS, MI, dysrhythmias, valvulardisease, and cardiomyopathy) or pulmonary disease, such as PE. However, syncope/near-syn- cope may result from other causes, such as gas-trointestinal (GI) hemorrhage or volume depletionfrom dehydration caused by excessive fluid loss or inadequate oral fluid intake. Do you have any upper respiratory symptoms? Patients with pulmonary infections (pneumonia or acute bronchitis) resulting in shortness of breathmay also have a cough, purulent sputum, feverPrimary Complaints 487Shortness of breath in adultsand/or chills, and possibly prodromal upper res- piratory tract (URI) symptoms. URI or \"cold\"symptoms include rhinorrhea generalizedmyalgias. Dyspnea sug-gest upper airway problems, specifically airwayobstruction, such as epiglottitis or foreign body. Are you coughing up blood? Hemoptysis may occur with pulmonary or upper airway infec- tions, tuberculosis, and vasculitis. Frothy blood-tinged a sign of acute pulmonaryedema. Any tarry or bloody stools? Patients with severe anemia (whether from GI bleeding or other causes) may experience dys-pnea because of decreased O 2delivery to the tis- sues or secondary to limited O 2carrying capacity from lack of red blood cells (RBCs). Have you been vomiting? Vomiting can lead to electrolyte abnormalities, which may result in dyspnea, or can be due to diabetic ketoacidosis, with dyspnea secondary toa compensatory respiratory alkalosis from meta-bolic abnormalities. Have you had recent unintentional weight loss? This could be due to malignancy, especially lung cancer in a smoker. Past medical Ahistory of previous PE, DVT , or clotting dis- order in a dyspneic patient suggests PE. Recentsurgery (especially abdominal or pelvic sur atrial malignancy, andprolonged immobility are Aprevious history of any neurologic or muscu- lar disorders may provide a clue to the etiology ofdyspnea, as patients with such conditions mayexperience respiratory muscle weakness anddevelop respiratory failure. CNS disorders thataffect the respiratory centers in the medulla couldlead to respiratory failure from loss of the centralrespiratory drive. Traumatic injury or disease of the cervical spine that affects C3/C4/C5 couldresult in paralysis of the diaphragm. Injury or ill- ness to either phrenic nerve can cause paralysis ofthe diaphragmatic muscles. Oncology patients, patients on immunosup- pressive agents, or patients with autoimmunedisorders are especially prone to dyspnea. Thismay be due to infection or severe anemia second-ary to bone marrow suppression. Female patients on birth control pills or estro- gens are at risk for PE. Medicines can have dan-gerous side effects and can be a clue to anyunderlying diseases. Allergies should be noted incase patients need therapy for their dyspnea, orif a particular medication is causing the dyspnea. Social Tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs Asignificant smoking history points towards COPD or lung cancer. A patient without a smokinghistory is unlikely to have COPD. An intoxicatedpatient with shortness of breath, cough, and fevermay have aspiration pneumonia. Patients inhalingillegal drugs may get a pneumonitis from the adul-terants used to \"cut\" the drugs. Intravenous drugabusers can contract human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV) infection from an infected needle, andmay present with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) as a manifestation of acquired immune defi-ciency syndrome (AIDS). Review the patient's occupational history or any acute or chronic exposures to toxins An acute hypersensitivity reaction or toxic lung injury may occur in workers who inhale variousparticulates. A dyspneic patient exposed to a firemay have smoke inhalation or a hypersensitivityreaction from burning chemicals or toxins. A dyspneic patient with the gradual onset of symptoms exposed to toxins at work over yearsTable 33.1 Predisposing conditions for pulmonary embolism Birth control pills and/or estrogens Cardiac disease: atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure Clotting disorders Family history Immobility Malignancy Pregnancy Previous pulmonary emboli or deep vein thrombosis Recent past surgery: asbestosis, silicosis, berylliosis, or \"coal worker's\" pneumoconiosis. Physical examination Physical examination may be instrumental indiagnosing the etiology of dyspnea, as well as indetermining which patients are critically ill andneed immediate therapy (even resuscitation). General appearance The patient's general appearance is a critical partof the physical examination. A patient who is sit-ting upright and leaning forward on the hands(the \"tripod\" position) is urgently attempting tomaintain an open airway and improve ventila-tion. Pursing of the lips, intercostal retractions, orthe use of accessory muscles are other methodsto facilitate air entry into the lungs. A patientwho can speak in full sentences does not have significant respiratory distress; a patient who canspeak only a few words has moderate respira-tory distress. A patient who is too short of breathto even answer with a few words is experiencingsevere respiratory distress. An anxious appear-ance or agitation suggests hypoxia. Somnolencesuggests hypercarbia. Vital signs Fever is nonspecific and may occur with respira-tory infections or other etiologies, such as PE.Although a fever is typically found in patientswith respiratory infections, they may have a nor-mal temperature or hypothermia. Patients withPE rarely have temperatures /H11022102\u00b0F. Hypotension can occur secondary to dehydra- tion, sepsis, shock, hemorrhage. The combina-tion of hypotension dyspnea should raiseconcern for PE, cardiac disease, and tensionpneumothorax. Increased respiratory effort andrate, especially if prolonged, may contribute todehydration due to increased insensible lossesfrom the airway and lungs. Tachycardia usually accompanies respiratory distress, although exceptions may occur in patientstaking beta- or calcium channel blockers. Thesemedications may blunt the patient's heart rate(HR) response to respiratory distress. The respiratory rate can be a clue to underlying respiratory problems. In an attempt to improve oxygenation and ventilation, there is a com-pensatory incr ease in the respiratory rate. An abnormally low respiratory rate ( bradypnea ) is anominous sign, usually signifying impending res-piratory failure. Although a normal respiratoryrate generally suggests that respiration is notimpaired, this finding can be tragically mislead-ing and must be viewed in the context of thepatient's presentation. For example, an asthmaticin respiratory distress will initially increase theirrespiratory rate in order to improve their oxy- genation and ventilation. However, they canmaintain this compensation for only a finiteperiod of time. When they begin to tire from theadditional work of breathing, their respiratoryrate starts to drop. They may fall into the normalrange of respiratory rates during this period ofdecompensation before they become bradypneicand have a respiratory arrest. All patients complaining of shortness of breath should have pulse oximetry measured. Althoughpulse oximetry has a few technical limitations, a pulse oximetry /H1102190% indicates hypoxia and requires immediate evaluation (Table 33.2). Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat Signs of respiratory distress include nasal flaring,pursing of the lips, grunting, and perioralcyanosis. Any facial abnormalities or asymmetrysecondary to masses, tumors, infections, or edemathat could result in an obstructed airway should beidentified. Drooling or inability to handle secre-tions is worrisome for upper airway obstruction.Stridor may accompany upper airway obstruction. If signs of airway obstruction are present, allow the patient to remain sitting upright or inthe position they find maximally comfortable,since this may help keep the upper airway open.Do not force the patient to lie flat or tilt their headbackwards. Do not insert a tongue blade into themouth, since this may worsen airway obstructionand convert a partial airway obstruction into a Shortness of breath in adults 488 Primary ComplaintsTable 33.2 Clinical signs of respiratory distress Abnormal vital tachycardia of accessory muscles of the neck Abdominal breathing Paradoxical motion of chestcomplete obstruction. Most patients in respira- tory distress prefer the upright position, as thework of breathing is greater when lying flatbecause the supine position requires breathingagainst the weight of the abdomen. If the patient has no signs of airway obstruction and is stable, examine the oropharynx for masses,edema, infections, and bleeding. The presence of oral thrush suggests an immunocompromised host, such as an HIV-positive individual, and raisesconcern for opportunistic infections like PCP . Neck Examine the neck for asymmetry, masses,swelling, and jugular venous distention. Listenfor PE, or pneumothorax. Pulmonary Examination of the lungs is mandatory in theevaluation of any patient with dyspnea, andoften reveals the etiology of the patient's dyspnea. Inspect the chest for symmetric chest rise, deformities, or paradoxical movement. Paradox-ical chest movement refers to chest contractionduring inspiration and the abnormal part of thechest fluttering out during expiration; this is theopposite of normal chest wall motion. Intercostal,supraclavicular, and substernal retractions (theuse of accessory muscles of respiration) are indi-cators of respiratory distress. Palpate the chest for any areas of tenderness, masses, or crepitus (subcutaneous air is suggest-ive of pneumothorax). Auscultate both lung fields for wheezing, rhonchi. Unilaterally decreased breathsounds suggest pneumothorax, atelectasis, pleuraleffusion, or pneumonia. Wheezing usually is secondary to bronchospasm, which most oftenoccurs in pulmonary diseases such as asthma,COPD, bronchiolitis, and occasionally acute bron-chitis. Wheezing may also occur CHF (\"car- diac asthma\"), foreign bodies, and PE. Rales due to underlying cardiac disease(pulmonary edema or CHF) or pulmonary dis-ease (pneumonia). Rhonchi may be present withpneumonia or bronchitis. Hyperresonance on percussion occurs with a pneumothorax; on percussion suggestsa pleural effusion, infiltrate, hemothorax, Feel the precordial bulge, ahyperdynamic heart, or thrills. Auscultate forabnormal heart sounds such as an S3 or S4, rubs,clicks, or murmurs. An S3 gallop or S4 may occurwith CHF. A pericardial friction rub effusion. A sug-gests valvular disease. A murmur may be presentwith valvular disease other cardiac disorders,or may be physiologic. Palpate the pulses for strength, equality, and regularity. A weak or thready pulse occurs in shock. Abdomen Inspect for abdominal distention, pregnancy, or ascites, which can limit movement of the dia-phragm and interfere with respiration. Identifythe \"see-saw\" CHF. The presence of hepatojugular reflux(distention of the neck veins with firm palpationof the liver) indicates heart failure. Neurologic Ageneralized muscular disorder with peripheral muscle weakness may also have respiratorymuscle weakness, leading to respiratory distressor failure. Extremity Inspect for cyanosis, edema, clubbing, cords,venous distention, changes of peripheral vascu-lar disease, infection, or nicotine stains. Clubbingindicates longstanding hypoxia. The presence ofunilateral leg swelling and dyspnea suggests PE. Skin Examine the skin for color (pallor, cyanosis),temperature and moisture (cold/clammy orwarm/dry). The skin should also toassess rashes (suggestinginfection) or infection such as meningo-coccemia), or track marks (denoting IVDA).

However, some physiciansconsider the etiology in terms of acute versuschronic processes. Table 33.4 lists the presentation,work-up, and treatment for a number of causes ofdyspnea. Diagnostic testing Since the majority of patients with dyspnea havecardiopulmonary disease, the two most commondiagnostic tests are the chest radiograph andelectrocardiogram (ECG). These two tests areeasy to perform, noninvasive, inexpensive, safe,and can quickly confirm or exclude many com-mon diagnoses. Other commonly utilized adjunct-ivestudies are also discussed. Radiologic studies Chest X-ray Since pulmonary disorders are the most common etiology of dyspnea (about half in one study ofadults in a clinic setting), the chest X-ray may bethe most useful test in dyspneic patients of allages. Posteroanterior (PA) and lateral chest filmsprovide the most information. However, in veryill patients, a portable anteroposterior (AP) filmcan be performed at the bedside and interpretedimmediately. Additionally, this prevents a poten-tially unstable patient from leaving the ED. Thechest film can reveal abnormalities such as aninfiltrate, may distinguish CHF from COPD, andcan exclude a clinically significant pneumo-thorax (Figure 33.1). A normal chest X-ray in thepresence of unexplained hypoxemia is worri-some for PE. Patients with mild exacerbations of asthma or COPD who respond to emergenttherapy do not need routine chest X-rays. Electrocardiogram An ECG is warranted in dyspneic patients withknown or suspected CAD, and in patients withboth and chest pain. rep-resent an \"anginal equivalent,\" especially in The of\"silent\" myocardial infarction (MI) is estimatedto be about 20% of all MIs. The ECG may also behelpful for detecting cardiopulmonary diseasesother than ACS that present with dyspnea,including CHF, pericarditis, cardiomyopathy,and dysrhythmias. The ECG is rarely helpful inthe diagnosis of pulmonary em boli. The classic finding of \"S 1Q3T3\" is neither sensitive nor spe- cific. Sinus tachycardia and right ventricular strain are more commonly present. Laboratory studies Arterial blood gas Arterial blood gases (ABGs) are not routinely necessary in all dyspneic patients. They may beuseful in patients with unexplained dyspnea,altered mental status, suspected acidosis, andserious illness. and meta- bolic disorders can lead to acidosis that may resultin compensatory hyperventilation and dyspnea. The ABG may be used to calculate the alveolar- arterial gradient (A-a gradient). This is the calcu-lated difference between the alveolar and arterialO 2, representing the difference in the PO 2 between the alveolus and the blood. The alveolar oxygen tension, PAO 2, is calcu- lated from the alveolar gas equation FIO 2/H11005 inspired oxygen fraction, PB /H11005barometric pres- sure, PH 2O/H11005water vapor pressure (which is 47 at sea level), and RQ /H11005respiratory quotient, which is the rate of CO 2production/rate of oxygen con- sumption (a constant which is 0.8). PAO 2/H11005FIO 2(PB-P H 2O) - PaCO 2/RQ. Thus, in room with FIO 2of 0.21 and a PCO 2 the difference between the alveolar and arterial blood PO 2, or PAO 2/H11002PaO 2. Normally, this difference is between 2-10 mmHg. This value normally increases with age, and may be as high as 30 mmHg in elderly patients.Abnormal A-a gradients may be found in condi-tions such as PE, although this is neither sensitivenor specific. D-dimer The D-dimer is a product of blood clot breakdown and is typically elevated in patients with thrombo- embolic disease. The D-dimer is nonspecific andShortness of breath in adults 494 Primary Complaints (a) (b) Figure 33.1 (a) Congestive heart failure.

In patients with lowclinical risk for PE, a negative D-dimer assay makes the diagnosis very unlikely. Cardiac enzymes Cardiac enzymes (Troponin, CK-MB, and Myoglobin) should be ordered if an ACS is a pos-sible cause of the dyspnea. Dyspnea is a commonpresentation of ACS in the elderly and in diabet-ics. Furthermore, prolonged dyspnea, hypoxia,and increased work peptide B-type natriuretic peptide in the diagnosis of CHF in patients withundifferentiated dyspnea. BNP is a good screen-ing tool because of its high sensitivity and highnegative predictive value. BNP levels are gener-ally increased in patients presenting with CHF,whereas a level /H11021100 pg/ml is very accurate in excluding CHF as the cause of dyspnea. BNPmay be falsely elevated in some patients withoutCHF, so the BNP level needs to be interpreted inthe context of the patient's clinical presentation. White blood cell Although an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and/or left shift can occur with many infec-tions, malignancies, and inflammatory processes, patients with a pulmonary infection such as pneu-monia may have a normal WBC and differential.However, a WBC count with differential can behelpful in certain situations. A markedly elevatedWBC and/or a significantly abnormal differentialsuggests an infectious pulmonary process ormalignancy, especially in combination with anabnormal chest X-ray. An abnormal peripheralsmear showing immature forms or blasts is sug-gestive of malignancy. A markedly decreased WBCraises the possibility of immunosuppression andincreased susceptibility to infection. A patient withan infiltrate on chest X-ray and a very low absoluteneutrophil count (ANC) is at greater risk foropportunistic infectious complications; this willundoubtedly influence the choice of antibiotics. Hematocrit/hemoglobin The hematocrit (Hct)/hemoglobin (Hgb) may also be helpful in the evaluation of dyspnea. Amarkedly low Hct/Hgb can cause dyspnea due to inadequate delivery of O 2to the cells or tissue from lack of RBCs. Conversely, a markedlyelevated Hct/Hgb can occur in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease or poly- cythemia, who may present with dyspnea. Electrolytes Serum electrolytes may be indicated in patients who dyspnea or tachypnea to evaluate formetabolic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, or sig-nificant dehydration. Glucose Adextrostix, accucheck, or bedside glucose test (confirmed by a serum glucose) is indicated when hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis is suspected as the cause of the dyspnea ortachypnea. Pregnancy test In women of childbearing age, a pregnancy test may be indicated. Pregnant women have anincreased risk of pulmonary emboli and pre-eclampsia, two life-threatening disorders thatcan present with dyspnea. A positive pregnancytest may influence the choice of diagnostic tests.Aventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan is preferred over computed tomography (CT) of the chest inpregnant women with suspected PE becausethere is less radiation exposure. A half-dose per-fusion scan without the ventilation componentcan be done in order to reduce radiation expos-ure to the fetus. Placing a lead apron over theuterus during the chest roentgenogram will alsodecrease fetal radiation exposure. Other laboratories In patients for whom ACS or PE is a likely cause of dyspnea, baseline prothrombin time (PT) andpartial thromboplastin time (PTT) tests are indi-cated if anticoagulation is being considered.Liver function tests may be done if ascites orhepatomegaly is present. In some patients withpulmonary infections, other studies such as bloodcultures, sputum Gram's stain and sputum cul-ture may be warranted. In patients in whom apulmonary malignancy is a concern, sputum forcytology may be sent for evaluation. Primary Complaints 495Shortness of breath in adultsShortness of breath in adults 496 Primary ComplaintsAdditional specialized studies Chest computed tomography Helical chest CT has emerged as the modality of choice for the diagnosis of PE (Figure 33.2). ChestCT has the advantage over V/Q scan in that itmay identify pulmonary or thoracic abnormal-ities in addition to PE.Ventilation/perfusion scans Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scans were once commonly ordered to diagnose PE, despite thetest's several limitations. In patients with an abnor-mal chest X-ray, there is a high incidence of inde-terminate readings. Similarly, up to 40% of patientswith a high pretest probability of PE but low prob-ability V/Q scan have a PE. Recognizing these limitations, the V/Q scan is currently reserved forpatients with contrast allergies, renal insufficiency(creatinine /H110221.5), or pregnancy (Figure 33.3). Echocardiogram The echocardiogram may be useful to diagnose a pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade. In lesscritical situations, the disease, disease, cardio-myopathy (HOCM), cardiac tumors, or PE. Peak expiratory flow rate The peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), also calledthe peak flow (PF), can be useful to monitor a patient's response to bronchodilator therapy.Measurements of PF are commonly obtained in ED patients since it is noninvasive, easy toobtain, and cost-effective. The results are dependent on patient cooperation and effort, and Figure 33.3 Lung ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan. The bottom row shows different views of the ventilation study. The top row showsthe same views of the perfusion study. Heterogeneous perfusion is observ ed in both lung fields, w ith multiple peripheral wedge-shaped defects present with preserved ventilation (mismatched defects), consistent with high probability for pulmonary embolism.

Mahadevan, MD.cannot be used in critically ill patients. Trends in PEFR may be more useful than absolute values inmany cases. General treatment principles The general appearance of the patient is key to determining which patients need immediate lifesaving measures (Table 33.5). The first prior-ity is to determine whether the patient is in respira-tory distress, respiratory failure, or shock. If this is the case, treatment must be instituted immedi-ately, before the entire history is obtained and thephysical examination is completed. Evaluation of the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) is the first priority. Does thepatient have a patent airway? Is the patient inrespiratory failure? Does the patient have respi- ratory distress and/or shock requiring emergenttreatment? Rules when treating patients with dyspnea include maintaining the airway and keeping itopen, and providing supplemental O 2. Pulse oximetry should be placed in order to detecthypoxia and monitor therapy. Patients in the EDbeing evaluated for significant, life-threateningcauses of dyspnea should be placed in a moni-tored bed with continuous HR, blood pressure(BP), and ECG monitoring, in addition to thecontinuous pulse oximetry. Administer supplemental O 2to any patient who suffers from hypoxia, respiratory distress,respiratory failure, or shock, even if the patienthas COPD. It is more important to provide O 2to the tissues than to be concerned about suppress-ing the hypoxic respiratory drive in COPDpatients. After the administration of supplementalO 2, allow the patient to sit upright, unless there are contraindications such as an acute cervicalspine injury. The upright position makes it easierfor the patient to breathe by decreasing the workof breathing. This position decreases the \"abdom-inal breathing,\" aids accessory muscle use, and decreases pulmonary congestion in patient with heart failure. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP),or continous positive airway pressure (CPAP)may be tried in some patients with respiratory distress. The physician should be prepared to intubate a patient in respiratory distress if thepatient fails a brief trial of NIPPV . If bradypnea or apnea occurs, ventilation may be assisted with bag-valve-mask prior to defini-tive airway management. Emergent airway man-agement may be indicated if airway obstruction,altered mental status, shock, inability to speak,or inadequate ventilation is present. Intubation isthe definitive airway of choice, with laryngealmask airway (LMA), fiberoptics, cricothyrotomy,or transtracheal jet ventilation serving as alterna-tives in the event of unsuccessful intubation.Emergent airway management is discussed indetail in Chapter 2. Acute asthma excacerbation Pharmacologic agents that are used for the treat-ment of an acute asthmatic episode are known as \"rescue medications.\" The inhaled beta-2-selective agonists are the all exacerbations. Inhaled beta-2-selective agonists cause bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. The most com- monly used beta-agonist in this sympathomimeticclass of drugs is albuterol. Inhaled beta-agonistsare generally preferred over other routes ofadministration (such as subcutaneous) becauseof fewer side effects and better efficacy. Anti-cholinergic agents, such as ipratropium, causebronchodilation via inhibition of vagal because oftheir anti-inflammatory effects. These includeblocking the release of inflammatory mediators(which attract polymorphonuclear leukocytes), Primary Complaints 497Shortness of breath in adults Table 33.5 Treatment for the dyspneic patient Airway, breathing, circulation Maintain the airway Give O 2(even if chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is present) Apply pulse oximetry with continuous monitoring Continuous monitoring of HR, BP , ECG May try NIPPV in some patients Emergency airway management, if needed: endotracheal or nasotracheal intubation, laryngealmask airway, transtracheal jet ventilation,cricothyrotomy (surgical) Sit patient upright ( work of breathing, may pulmonary congestion in CHF) if no acute cervical spine injury If possible airway obstruction: do not lie patientflat, lean head backward, or use a tongue blade in mouthShortness of breath in adults 498 Primary Complaintsblocking increased capillary permeability, and increasing the \"receptiveness\" and receptors. High-dosesof corticosteroids for short durations are usedinitially for in in orsteroid-dependent asthmatics. Inhaled cortico-steroids are prophylactic treatment for essen-tially all patients with asthma. Antibiotics aregiven only in the presence of a bacterial infection.With severe asthma or status asthmaticus, med- ications such as magnesium, epinephrine, andheliox are sometimes administered in addition tothose discussed. Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease The mainstay of therapy for acute exacerba- tion of COPD is the same as for asthma: beta-adrenergic agents, anticholinergic bron-chodilators, and corticosteroids. The need forcorticosteroids is even more apparent in patientswith COPD. Antibiotics are more often initiatedin patients experiencing COPD exacerbations, asbacterial infections are more likely. Pneumonia Specific therapy depends on the underlying etio-logic agent causing the pneumonia. Bacterialinfections are treated with antibiotics. The choiceof antimicrobial therapy is influenced not onlyby the suspected causative organism, but also by age, comorbidity, and clinical severity.Empiric antibiotic therapy is based on whetherthe pneumonia is \"community-acquired\" or\"hospital-acquired.\" Aspiration pneumonias areparticularly difficult to treat, and often occur in debilitated patients, alcoholics, patients withchanges in consciousness, and those who cannotprotect their airway. Pneumonia in an HIV-positive patient differs from pneumonia in a geriatric nursing home patient with numerous comorbidities (such as diabetes, CHF, COPD, renal failure, or risk of aspiration). An atypical pneumonia in an otherwise healthy young adulthas a relatively benign (often outpatient) course.Supportive treatment is generally the rule for viral pneumonia, although amantadine can beused for severe pneumonia due to influenza.Ribavirin is optional therapy for severe respira-tory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia.Congestive heart failure Emergency treatment of CHF includes removal ofthe precipitating factor(s), identification and cor-rection of the underlying etiology, as well as redistribution and removal of excess fluid in the lungs. Three common mnemonics to help remem-ber therapies used in the treatment of CHF areprovided in Table 33.6 (these treatment modal-ities are not listed in particular order of use). In the setting of acute pulmonary edema, 100% O 2must be provided, often delivered under positive pressure. The patient is maintained inthe upright sitting posture, with legs dangling ifpossible to assist with fluid redistribution awayfrom the lungs. Many of the clinical manifestations of CHF result from hypervolemia and expansion of the interstitial fluid volume. Commonly usedpharmacologic agents in the treatment of CHFTable 33.6 Mnemonic therapies used in the treatment of CHF ME Uupright position Nnitrates/nitroprusside/nesiritide (dialysis if appropriate) Ddigoxin AA CE inhibitors of breath in adultsinclude diuretics to control excessive fluid. They contribute to excess fluid removal and redistribu- tion. In acute emergencies, loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) are administered IV . This routeresults in rapid and reliable absorption, resulting in increased venous capacitance (venodilation),which decreases venous return, in addition toreducing circulating blood volume by its renal diuretic effect. The usual starting dose forfurosemide is 20-80 mg IV , depending on priorexposure, chronic therapy, and renal function(larger doses are required in patients with renalinsufficiency). Nitroglycerin may be administered sublin- gually or IV to decrease pulmonary congestionand peripheral resistance through veno- andarteriodilation. This also causes afterload reduc-tion and redistributes fluid from the lungs. Inacute emergencies, when systolic blood pressure(SBP) is high due to increased sympathetic toneand intense vasoconstriction, sodium nitroprus- side may be administered IV . Patients receiving nitroprusside must have continuous monitoring,preferably using an arterial line. Nesiritide is arecombinant human brain natriuretic peptide that has been studied regarding its use in patientsin CHF. It is promoted as having vasodilatory,natriuretic, and diuretic effects. Nesiritide is con-traindicated in patients who are hypersensitiveto any of its components. It should not be used inpatients with cardiogenic shock or in those withSBP /H1102190 mmHg, and should be avoided in patients with suspected or known low cardiacfilling pressures. Morphine sulphate decreases adrenergic vaso- constrictor stimuli to arteriolar venous beds. It also reduces anxiety. Caution is warranted, as itmay cause CNS and respiratory depression. Dopamine and dobutamine have a limited role in the acute management of CHF exacerba- tions. These inotropic agents may be necessarywhen patients present in acute respiratory distressand hypotension, and are not responding to othertherapeutic agents. Dopamine (which increasesrenal blood flow in low doses according to some authorities), can increase peripheral tone if apatient is hypotensive and needs support.Dobutamine has been demonstrated to improvecardiac contractility and output, which mayassist with fluid redistribution. However, dobut-amine can cause tachycardia and dysrhythmias,and should be used with caution. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibi- tors cause peripheral vasodilation, decreasing systemic that may lead to regression ofleft ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The effect of ACE inhibitors may be partly due to adecrease in myocardial angiotensin II productionand to cardiac remodeling. The role of ACEinhibitors in the acute management of CHFremains controversial. Some emergency phys- icians advocate sublingual ACE inhibitor II blockers (ARBs) promoteregression of LVH due to hypertension. Contraindications to the use of ACE inhibitorsinclude pregnancy, prior ACE inhibitor-inducedangioedema, or hyperkalemia. Bronchodilators, such as beta-2-agonists, may be of limited benefit in patients presenting inacute pulmonary edema, as there is often mild tomoderate bronchospasm secondary to fluid con-gestion. Caution is warranted, however, as theseagents may increase HR, agitation or anxiety,thereby worsening dyspnea. Digoxin has no definitive role in the acute management of CHF. Digitalis glycosides arecommonly used in chronic therapy to increasemyocardial and improve ventricu-lar emptying. Digoxin toxicity should be consid-ered with acute or chronic digoxin therapy,especially in association with concomitant dehy-dration and renal insufficiency. Beta-blockers slow the HR (increasing the time available for coronary flow and filling of theleft ventricle), decrease myocardial O 2demand, and lower the BP (causing a regression of LVH).The use of beta-blockers in acute CHF isextremely controversial; most authorities do notrecommend their use in the ED unless diastolic dysfunction is known to exist, or if tachycardiaor excess catecholamines is causing the CHFexacerbation, not a response to it. When needed,short-acting beta-blockers (such as esmolol) arerecommended. Chronic beta-blocker therapy has been shown to improve LV function and long-term survival. Contraindications include brady-cardia or known artrioventricular (AV) block,severe lung disease or br onchospasm, and previ- ous adverse response to beta-blockers. They should be used with extreme caution in asthmat-ics and patients with COPD. For patients on dialysis with chronic renal fail- ure, presentations of acute CHF exacerbationsdue to fluid overload with resultant respiratorydistress are common. Emergent dialysis may bethe only treatment that can successfully removethe fluid responsible for respiratory distress. It should be noted that not all of these drugs are used for every patient presenting in CHF. TheShortness of breath in adults 500 Primary Complaintschoice of pharmacologic agent/s depends on many variables, including the clinical situation,vital signs, comorbid conditions (angina, hyper-tension, diabetes), and whether the heart failureis due to systolic or diastolic dysfunction. In addition to pharmacologic therapy, lifestyle modification is recommended for CHF patients.These include smoking cessation, decreasingalcohol intake, salt restriction, water r estriction if hyponatremic, weight r eduction, and cardiac rehabilitation if stable. Pulmonary embolism Therapy for PE is anticoagulation. The standardanticoagulant regimen is the simultaneous initi-ation of heparin (either unfractionated or low-molecular weight) and oral warfarin in stablepatients. Major side effects of heparin are bleed-ing and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia(HIT), often associated with therapy for PE or respiratorydistress. Thrombolytics accelerate clot lysis, buttheir use is associated with an increased risk ofintracranial and GI bleeding. Contraindicationsto their use include patients at very high risk ofbleeding or unstable patients needing immediateintervention, such as surgery or insertion of avena cava filter. Central airway obstruction Management of central or upper airway obstruc-tion entails ensuring ventilation and oxygen-ation. Following this, determining the treatmentdepends on the etiology. If an allergic or anaphy-lactic reaction is suspected, then epinephrine(aerosolized, subcutaneous, or IV), IV diphenhy-dramine, IV corticosteroids, and sometimes IVH 2-blockers are used. If the cause is a bacterial infection (epiglottis, retropharyngeal abscess)then antibiotics are warranted. With epiglottitis,management may vary depending on age andseverity. Pediatric patients and critically-illadults generally go to the operating room (OR)for emergent securing of the airway. In selectedstable adult epiglottitis patients, admission to anintensive care unit (ICU) with close monitoringfor airway obstruction and IV antibiotics can bedone. Some patients with retropharyngeal abs cess may need surgical drainage in the OR, depend-ing on the amount of airway compromise. If theetiology is a foreign body, removal via laryn-goscopy or bronchoscopy is indicated. If a massis responsible for the obstruction, then surgery,radiation therapy, or chemotherapy are possibletreatment options. Rapid involvement of special-ists is often mandatory and may be life-saving inthese circumstances. Special patients Elderly Cardiopulmonary causes of dyspnea increase inincidence with advancing age. Typically, olderpatients have multiple comorbidities (e.g., COPDand CHF) limiting their cardiopulmonary reserveso that an additional disorder such as pneumo-nia is poorly tolerated. Any physiologic stress onthe heart or lungs may result in increased mor-bidity and mortality. It is usually more difficultto diagnose the causes of dyspnea in the elderlyfor many reasons. Signs and symptoms may be nonspecific, mild, and even absent. Diagnostictests are less likely to be abnormal or specific.Elderly patients may have an acute MI withoutchest pain. Their baseline ECG is often abnormalwith hypertrophy, previous MI, or a bundlebranch block, so that diagnosing an acute MI byECG alone may be difficult. Laboratory studiesmay have an abnormal baseline. For example, inpatients with renal failure, the troponin is oftenelevated even if an acute MI is not present. If anelevated troponin is present, whether or not it isfrom cardiac or renal disease (or both) may bedifficult to determine. Pediatric The etiologies of dyspnea in children vary fromthose in adults. ACS is not a common cause ofdyspnea in children. Cardiac causes of dyspneain pediatric patients include myocarditis ormyocardiopathy, congenital heart disease, andpericarditis. Although asthma occurs in bothchildren and adults, other chronic lung disease isuncommon in children with the exception of cystic fibrosis. In comparison, chronic lung dis-ease is fairly common in adults, especially COPDor pneumoconiosis from occupational or envi-ronmental exposure. In terms of incidence, pulmonary disorders (asthma, pneumonia, bron-chitis, other respiratory infections, congenitaldisorders, and acquired diseases) make up agreater percentage of dyspnea than cardiac dis-orders in pediatric patients when compared toadults (Chapter 34).Primary Complaints 501Shortness of breath in adultsPregnant Dyspnea is extremely common in pregnancy and occurs in three-fourths of pregnant women by30-weeks gestation. This physiologic dyspnea ofpregnancy occurs gradually, usually with exer-tion, and is not severe. The cause of dyspnea dur-ing pregnancy is due to the physiologic effects ofan elevated diaphragm and postural-dependentalterations in blood flow. Also, hyperventilationfrom increased circulating progesterone and anincreased sensitivity to CO 2results in dyspnea. The physiologic dyspnea of pregnancy rarelyincreases in severity during the final weeks before delivery. However, dyspnea during pregnancythat is acute, severe, progressive, occurs at rest,or occurs with other symptoms or signs of car-diopulmonary disease is abnormal and deservesfurther evaluation. Pregnant women are atincreased risk for two life-threatening causes ofdyspnea: PE and preeclampsia. Patients who are pregnant, postpartum, have had a recent miscarriage or abortion, or have had recent gynecologic or pelvic surgery are atincreased risk for PE. Additionally, women whohave a history of multiple episodes of fetaldemise (e.g., multiple miscarriages) may have acoagulopathy that predisposes them to miscar-riage and PE. When any pregnant patient pres-ents with shortness of breath or chest pain, PE is adiagnostic possibility that warrants consideration. Do not let unrealistic concerns over potential fetal harm from radiation exposure dissuade you from doing appropriate radiologic studieswhen warranted. Limiting fetal exposure can beaccomplished by: 1.Shielding the abdomen when doing the chest X-ray 2.Doing a V/Q scan instead of a chest CT scan 3.Doing a half-dose perfusion scan without the ventilation component. Disposition Patients requiring supplemental O 2to maintain adequate oxygenation, and those with respiratorydistress need admission. Disposition generallydepends on the underlying etiology and responseto therapy. For example, a dyspneic patient withasthma, COPD, or CHF who responds to therapyin the ED and is no longer dyspneic (or returns tohis or her baseline if suffering from chronic dys-pnea), has acceptable pulse oximetry, a normalrespiratory rate and no signs of respiratory distress may be discharged home on appropriatetherapy with close follow-up. If any of the aboveare abnormal (dyspnea remains, hypoxia,increased work of breathing, PF significantlybelow baseline) then admission is warranted.Admission is also indicated in a patient with dys-pnea secondary to ACS, such as unstable anginaor acute MI, even if he or she responds to therapyin the ED and is no longer dyspneic. Disposition may be affected by the clinical situation and comorbidities. In an otherwisehealthy young adult without respiratory distressand normal vital signs, pneumonia is generallywell-tolerated, and the patient can be safely dis-charged home. A geriatric patient with COPD orCHF has limited cardiopulmonary reserve, andpneumonia in such a patient is not well-toler-ated. Admission for initial therapy and observa-tion is indicated. Similarly, an asthmatic childwith a poor social situation and unreliable caregivers, who may not receive his or her dis-charge medications, should be considered foradmission. Pearls and pitfalls Patients with apparently normal breathing(e.g., normal respiratory rate and respirations)may have a serious etiology for their dyspnea. A normal pulse oximetry and ABG do not rule out significant disease. For example, patientswith dyspnea secondary to PE or ACS mayhave a normal pulse oximetry and PaO 2. Absence of chest pain does not rule out ACSor PE in patients with dyspnea. Dyspnea and hypotension or shock is anominous combination. These patients needemergent evaluation and immediate treatment. Dyspnea and chest pain in adults usually hasa cardiopulmonary etiology and deservesfurther evaluation. Dyspnea during pregnancy is common.However, pregnant women with acute or unexplained severe dyspnea deservefurther evaluation, especially for PE. In pregnant women, do not avoid studiesthat are indicated. Remember, a chest X-raycan be done with shielding of the abdomen.AV/Q scan has less fetal radiation exposure than a chest CT scan. A half-dose perfusionscan without the ventilation component canbe done. Psychogenic dyspnea is a diagnosis ofexclusion. Other diagnoses should beShortness of breath in adults 502 Primary Complaintsconsidered and ruled out by history, physical examination, and testing as indicated. Do not assume hysterical patients havepsychogenic dyspnea. Patients with life-threatening causes of dyspnea may behysterical because of their hypoxia. All patients with dyspnea deserve anevaluation that includes a thorough history,physical examination, and simple diagnostictests. Specifically, pulse oximetry, a chest X-ray, and an ECG (if cardiac disease is aconcern). Do not assume that just because a patient has a history of a chronic cardiopulmonarydisease that his or her acute episode ofdyspnea is due to chronic disease. Forinstance, patients with CHF can develop PE,COPD patients can have acute pneumonia,and asthmatics can have a pneumothorax. Ambulation is a functional \"test\" which canprovide tremendous information about apatient's respiratory status. Vital signs andthe amount of dyspnea should be evaluatedfollowing ambulation and compared tobaseline, if possible. References 1.Castro M. Control of breathing.

In the US, tens of thousands of chil- dren are hospitalized for respiratory problemseach year. In the winter, most emergency physi-cians will likely evaluate several children withdifficulty breathing a day . The needed interven- tions can be as simple as reassurance for a headcold to intubation for respiratory failure. Theoutcomes vary considerably. Although most chil-dren recover completely from episodes of diffi-culty breathing, permanent lung or brain injuryand death may occur, typically in very younginfants or chronically-ill children. Anatomic essentials Infants and young children have relatively narrowairways, with high resistance. If the diameter ofthese small airways is decreased, the work ofbreathing can increase dramatically. The airwayscan narrow due to inflammation (e.g., asthma,chemical pneumonitis, bacterial tracheitis, croup), bronchospasm retropharyngeal abscess), excessive mucus and secretions with airway plugging (e.g., bronchioli-tis, bacterial tracheitis, pneumonia) or mechanicalobstruction (e.g., aspirated foreign body). Infants have a pliable chest wall and immature diaphragmwhich also contribute to respiratory fatigue andfailure. Increased work of breathing may cause achild to be unable to feed with resultant dehydra-tion or respiratory muscle fatigue leading to res-piratory failure and mechanical ventilation. History Conditions that cause difficulty breathing in chil-dren have many similar features. Many are pre-ceded by rhinorrhea, low-grade fever, and othersymptoms of upper respiratory tract infection.This can make differentiating between conditionsdifficult. The history, however, can be used tomodify the overall likelihood of some diagnoses.How old is this child? The likelihood of some disorders depends greatly on age. For example, pertussis is primarily seenin infants less than 6 months of age who are par-tially immunized. Croup is a disease of youngchildren, such as toddlers and preschool groups.Bronchiolitis is generally not diagnosed past theage of 2 years. Infants who do not yet crawl, usu-ally less than 9 months of age, seldom aspirateforeign bodies. How long have these symptoms been going on? The time course of the illness may be helpful. Abrupt-onset conditions include foreign bodyaspiration and chemical pneumonitis from hydro-carbon ingestion. Disorders such as bacterial tra- cheitis and epiglottitis may present after a fewdays of mild upper respiratory tract symptomsand then have a rapid worsening. Croup tends tobegin with mild coughing for a day or two beforethe parents notice a relatively severe barkingcough late in the evening. Bronchiolitis andasthma exacerbations typically worsen over a fewdays. Pertussis is usually associated with 7-10days of rhinorrhea and upper respiratory tractsymptoms, followed by 2-4 weeks of a relativelysevere staccato cough often accompanied by post-tussive vomiting and periods of cyanosis. Have there been any fevers or ill contacts? Fever or ill contacts tend to suggest an infec- tious etiology. Retropharyngeal and peritonsilarabscesses typically present with fever. Bronchiolitis usually presents with a fever while an asthmaexacerbation does not (unless the aggravatingfactor is an upper respiratory tract infection).Bacterial tracheitis and epiglottitis tend to havehigher fevers than croup upper respiratorytract infections, although the recent administra-tion of antipyretics or the presence of an immune-compromising condition may affect the presentingtemperature. Ill contacts may suggest a highlyinfectious agent such as pertussis or respiratorysyncytial virus (RSV).34 Shortness of breath in children Lance Brown, MD, MPH and Steven M. Green, MDShortness of breath in children 504 Primary ComplaintsDoes the child have a cough? What does it sound like? Some conditions cause children to have distinc- tive features to their cough. A seal-like, barkingcough in a toddler is characteristic of croup andcan be seen in bacterial tracheitis. Pertussis issuggested if a young infant has coughing thatcomes in bursts or paroxysms followed by peri-ods that are relatively free of coughing. A persist-ent, repetitive cough with an abrupt onset maybe due to an aspirated foreign body. A cough thatis associated with bilateral wheezing suggests abronchospastic process such as asthma or bron-chiolitis. How is the child feeding/urinating? It is important to assess the hydration status of a young child with difficulty breathing. Somethingas simple as nasal congestion in a young infantwho is an obligate nasal breather can result inserious dehydration. Some children are simplybreathing too fast to feed. The increased work ofbreathing, tachypnea, and fluid losses from thelungs may contribute to dehydration. Other find-ings such as sweating with feeds, suggestive ofcongestive heart failure, may be helpful in mak-ing a diagnosis. A history of feeding honey to ayoung infant may suggest botulism. How is the child handling their secretions? Although all young infants leave some drool on their toys and parents' shirts, excessive drool-ing may suggest epiglottitis, retropharyngealabscess, or an esophageal foreign body. Theseconditions typically inhibit swallowing to somedegree and present with excessive drooling. Where was this child when you noticed a problem? Being in the garage, under the sink, or out of sight may suggest a chemical ingestion or for-eign body aspiration. Being near water (even in atub or bucket) may suggest near-drowning. Past medical There are several conditions which may alter thelikelihood of certain diagnoses. If a child has ahistory of atopy, including eczema, environmen-tal allergies, or asthma, an exacerbation ofasthma is highly likely if the child is wheezing.Many children with a history of prematurity andintubation in the neonatal intensive care unithave bronchopulmonary dysplasia and areprone to lung infections that can become severe.Children with known cardiac defects maywheeze when they are in congestive heart fail-ure, or have a cardiac cause to their difficultybreathing. Children with laryngo- or tracheoma-lacia may become more acutely ill with croupthan other children. Clinicians should inquireabout chronic lung conditions such as cysticfibrosis. Medications One of the most common complaints in the ED isthat \"cough medicine\" does not work. Manycough medicines given to children are expecto-rants that actually make children cough morethan they would otherwise. Other medications,particularly for chronic conditions such asasthma, may give some indication of the severityof the child's underlying health. A child withasthma who has used inhaled beta-agonists afew times in their life may respond to a respira-tory infection more robustly than a child withsevere asthma who is frequently on oral steroidsin addition to beta-agonists. Immunizations Although perhaps important as a general markerof the overall health care that a child has beenreceiving, the presence of complete immu- nization seldom has a significant impact on theidentification or management of children withdifficulty breathing. Due to herd immunity,infections with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) are uncommon even in unimmunized children.Achild who has not received the pneumococcal vaccine may be more likely to have pneumoniadue to an invasive strain of the organism, but EDmanagement is not impacted by this. Pertussis is now typically seen in young infants who are incompletely immunized at the time of infec-tion because of their young age, even thoughthey are immunized according to publishedschedules. Family Some conditions run in families, such as asthma.Occasionally a family history will prove helpful.Primary Complaints 505Shortness of breath in childrenSocial Occasionally a social history will be revealing. Ahistory of homelessness may suggest tubercu- losis. Foster mothers who have just received achild may not know much of the medical history.Day care attendance may expose children to agreater number of viral respiratory illnesses, butthe importance of this in the ED is seldom signi-ficant. Smoke exposure in the home may exacer- bate chronic conditions such as asthma. Physical examination General appearance An assessment of the degree to which a child ishaving difficulty breathing can be made uponentering the examination room. Infants shouldbe removed from car seats or infant carriers andall young children should be undressed at leastfrom the waist up initially. There are three maincomponents to the initial general assessment: thework of breathing, the degree of dehydration,and the mental status. An experienced cliniciancan assess these three components in a matter ofseconds. Work of breathing Assessing the work of breathing is perhaps the key to assessing difficulty breathing in children.This assessment does not require a stethoscopeand can be made upon entering the patient'sroom. A happy, playful, well-appearing child generally has a normal work of breathing. Signsof increased work of breathing include retrac-tions, grunting, nasal flaring, head bobbing, sit-ting forward to maintain an open airway, andtachypnea (respiratory rates may approach 100breaths per minute in young infants). When thechild can no longer sustain the increased work ofbreathing, the child will characteristically appearfatigued, develop altered mental status, andhave periods of apnea or irregular respirations.Experienced clinicians make this vital assess- ment within seconds of seeing the child. Degree of dehydration The degree of dehydration may indirectly indi- cate the overall impact that increased work ofbreathing is having on the child. A child who isworking too hard or is too sick to feed requiresmore aggressive fluid resuscitation than a childwho is feeding well. A decrease in the number ofwet diapers per day may indicate dehydration.Other signs and symptoms of dehydration includea sunken fontanel or eyes, dry tongue and mouth,tachycardia, and either irritability or lethargy. Mental status Achild's mental status can be rapidly assessed by simply watching the child interact with the parent, play with a toy, interact with the environ-ment (i.e., pull things off the wall, climb aroundthe room), or by interacting with the patient. Abright, alert, interactive, smiling, playful child can be readily differentiated from a listless, limp,disinterested, tired-appearing child. Vital signs There are five main vital signs that should beassessed in children with difficulty breathing. Respiratory rate Although there are published tables of normal respiratory rates for children, these values are seldom helpful in the ED. The respiratory rate isquite variable and can depend on several factorsthat may change rapidly. Crying, fever, anxiety,hypoxia, increased work of breathing, shock,dehydration, and pain can make a child breathefaster than normal. Counting the respiratory ratefor only a few seconds and then using a multipleof that count to generate breaths per minute mayinaccurately reflect the true respiratory rate.Rough guidelines for tachypnea suggest that anormal respiratory rate during the first couple ofmonths of life is in the 30-60 breaths per minuterange. Respiratory rates greater than 60 for a sus-tained period of time while calm are nearlyalways abnormal. Very rapid rates in the 80-100range may be seen. As infants age, the normalrespiratory rate decreases. Older infants and tod- dlers typically have normal respiratory rates inthe 20-40 range. School-aged children usuallyhave respiratory rates in the 20s at most. Moreominous than tachypnea is bradypnea, or slowrespirations. Bradypnea typically signals respira- tory fatigue that may require prompt intubationand mechanical ventilation. Young infants in thefirst couple months of life should not be breath-ing slower than about 30 breaths per minute.Young children should not breathe more slowly than about 20 breaths per minute. Adolescentscan be assessed like adults.Heart rate The heart rate is variable in the same way as the respiratory rate. Multiple transient factorsmay result in tachycardia. These include crying,fever, anxiety, increased work of breathing, shock,dehydration, and pain. In young infants whohave difficulty breathing, a heart rate of about200 beats per minute is not uncommon. Supraven-tricular tachycardia is suggested by very rapidheart rates of at least 220 beats per minute andmore often in the high 200s. Persistent tachycar-dia while calm and relaxed most commonly rep-resents dehydration, but may also be seen in early shock and myocarditis. Pulse oximetry Using a non-invasive sensor that attaches to the finger, a painless assessment of the child's oxy-genation can be performed with a bedside pulseoximeter. This \"fifth vital sign\" should be routinelyassessed in all children with respiratory com-plaints. Subtle alterations in oxygenation that arenot typically picked up on physical examinationmay be appreciated with pulse oximetry. Pulseoximetry has several limitations, however. It can-not be used to exclude respiratory conditionssuch as pneumonia. Due to the small digits andvasoconstriction in acutely ill infants, the pulseoximeter may have difficulty picking up a signal and generating useful output. The pulse oximeter frequently false alarms when there is excessivemovement, the device fails to sense the pulse, orthe probe falls off. Typically, young children havepulse oximetry readings in the high 90s or 100% at sea level or in the low 90s at significant eleva-tion. The value that constitutes clinically signifi-cant hypoxia requiring oxygen administration andadmission to the hospital is unknown. Manyphysicians will select a value in the low 90s as theirthreshold for administering oxygen. Temperature Agood deal of fever phobia exists among par- ents and health care providers. In the setting of difficulty breathing, a fever typically suggests aninfectious etiology. Foreign bodies, for example,do not usually present with a fever. Blood pressure Although blood pressure measurements are commonly obtained on patients in the ED, the roleof blood pressure measurement in young infantsis controversial. Young children often have tran-siently elevated blood pressures in the ED thathave no clinical significance. Low blood pressuresare seen in critically ill patients. Young childrendo not exhibit low blood pressure even when theyare in early shock due to their excellent capacityto peripherally vasoconstrict. Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat Head In young infants, a sunken fontanel may suggest dehydration. Eyes The concurrent presence of conjunctivitis in the setting of clinical pneumonia is suggestive of aninfection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and may indicate that a macrolide antibiotic (e.g., erythro-mycin) is indicated. Ears An ear examination is seldom helpful in examin- ing a child with difficulty breathing. The inappro-priate diagnosis otitis media (\"soft call\") may lead to the inappropriate use of antibiotics in thesetting of a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Nose Copious rhinorrhea is most consistent with upper respiratory tract infections. Rhinorrhea in the set- ting of wheezing is consistent with asthma exac-erbated by a viral upper respiratory tract infectionand bronchiolitis. Significant rhinorrhea is nottypically seen in cases of peritonsillar or retropha-ryngeal abscess. Nasal flaring can be seen in young infants in respiratory distress. Throat The oropharyngeal examination may be particu- larly helpful in identifying cases of peritonsillarabscess. Dryness of the mucous membranes mayindicate dehydration. Physicians who practicedin the 1980s are familiar with the general princi-ple that no child with suspected epiglottitisshould have an oropharyngeal examination dueto the potential for the child's tenuous airway toclose. In contemporary practice this concern has Shortness of breath in children 506 Primary Complaintsessentially been eliminated due to the introduc- tion of the Hib vaccine and increased emphasison pediatric airway management by emergencyphysicians (including rapid sequence intubation). Neck Asymmetric cervical adenopathy is typicallyseen with peritonsillar abscesses. Pulmonary The vast majority of information about the pul-monary examination is obtained without a stetho-scope while assessing the general appearance andwork of breathing (see above). The features of thechest to specifically note include the presence orabsence of retractions, asymmetry of breathsounds when the right and left sides are com-pared, a prolonged expiratory phase or wheezing suggesting bronchospasm, and the presence ofrales. Palpation and percussion have no appre-ciable role in the chest examination of an infantor young child. Breath sounds The physical examination should include an assessment of stridor, wheezing, and abnormalor asymmetric breath sounds. Conditions thatpartially occlude the upper airway foreign body, croup, and bacterialtracheitis) typically cause stridor. Stridor is an abnormal sound made during inspiration. Condi-tions that partially occlude the lower airways, such as asthma and bronchiolitis, typically causewheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase.Wheezing is an abnormal sound made during expiration. Localized lung involvement as seenin pneumonia or aspirated foreign bodies maysimply cause one side of the chest to sound different than the other. Rales can be heard inchemical pneumonitis, near-drowning, and lesscommonly in congestive heart failure. With poorair exchange, there may be few or no breathsounds (the \"quiet\" wheezer). Cardiac There are two main objectives in performing acardiac examination on a child who is having dif-ficulty breathing: identifying pathologic mur-murs and identifying rate-r elated problems. Heart murmurs are quite common in young chil-dren; many have a known murmur that is of noclinical significance. Benign murmurs may alsobe heard in the setting of fever and shock. These \"flow murmurs\" are typically hear d in systole, do not last for its entire duration, and are decrescendoin pattern. Pathologic murmurs that may have subtle and not-so-subtle features.Subtle features that have been described but maybe difficult to assess in a loud ED on a tachy-cardic, ill child include an S3 and the absence of asplit S1 sound. Not-so-subtle features, such as aloud, blowing, holosytolic murmur, are unlikelyto be missed. Abdomen Ameaningful abdominal examination on a child who is having difficulty breathing can be verydifficult. Depending on the work of breathing, ayoung child with respiratory distress may prefer-entially sit up to breath. A brief and somewhatgross examination may be performed on thechild in a seated position. If forced to lie down,these children typically fight to sit back up, straintheir abdominal muscles, and provide no oppor-tunity for a meaningful examination. A reasonableexam may be possible in young infants and chil-dren who are either moribund or in little distress. Extremities Capillary refill is quite dependent on the ambienttemperature. An abnormal capillary refill is usu-ally defined as greater than 2 seconds duration.Although capillary refill prolongation may rep-resent shock, peripheral vasoconstriction due to an infant being cold will also manifest as pro-longed capillary refill. Cyanotic extremities maybe seen in hypoxic children. Neurologic The neurologic examination performed on achild with difficulty breathing is typically briefand global. The physician should immediatelybe able to note how the child interacts with his orher environment. A child who is lying down withobviously labored breathing who looks tired canbe easily distin guished from a child who is play- ing, smiling, and, if old enough, sitting up and talking comfortably. As a child tires from a pro-longed increase in the work of breathing, mentalstatus typically deteriorates. The child will appeartired, less interactive, and may stare somewhatblankly forward no longer seeming to recognizeor care about the environment. Altered mental Primary Complaints 507Shortness of breath in childrenstatus in a child with difficulty breathing can result from related concurrent conditions. For example, a child with pneumonia may developsepsis. This may progress to septic shock causingtachypnea initially and then respiratory depres-sion and altered mental status. Children seem totolerate modest degrees of hypoxia, but if acutelyand severely hypoxic, mental status may bedepressed. Fluid losses typically occur from theinability to feed, insensible losses with exhala tion, and increased work of breathing. These fluidlosses may lead to dehydration that can result in depressed mental status. This is especially true if dehydration progresses to hypovolemicshock.

Laboratory studies Specific testing Some tests may identify the etiologic agent, although the utility of these tests in the ED isquestionable. There is a nasal wash test for RSV ,the organism identified in about 50% of bronchi-olitis cases. This test is performed on nasopha-ryngeal mucus, and results can be returned withinan hour in most hospitals. Since RSV is highlyinfectious, the primary purpose of this test is todetect infected children prior to hospitalization,and place them in respiratory isolation. The useof this test for children treated as outpatients iscontroversial. There is also a nasopharyngeal swabtest for pertussis. This test is also performed onnasopharyngeal mucus but it takes nearly twoweeks to get the results. Primary Complaints 511Shortness of breath in children Figure 34.1 Right lung hyperexpansion.

Figure 34.3A child with a retropharyngeal abscess. Note theprevertebral soft tissue swelling.Arterial blood gas An arterial blood gas is rarely indicated for infants and children with difficulty breathing. If carbonmonoxide poisoning is suspected, as in smokeinhalation, an arterial blood gas with co-oximetrycan be used to determine the percent carboxy-hemoglobin. It may also be used to guide manage-ment. If methemoglobinemia is suspected, as seenin teething gel ingestion, co-oximetry can be usedto determine the percent methemoglobinemia, andmay guide therapy with respect to administeringmethylene blue. Arterial blood gases may also beused after intubation to evaluate and appropri-ately adjust ventilator settings. In the vast majorityof cases, pulse oximetry and the clinical examina-tion are used to monitor the patient and guidetherapy. The degree to which a child has respira-tory fatigue determines when to intubate a childwith respiratory distress, notthe partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) from an arterial blood gas. Peak flow Peak flow is a bedside test in which a child isasked to blow as hard as they can with their lipsaround an L-shaped tube. One portion of thetube has a sliding gauge that is moved by thechild's breath. The numeric output from thesepeak flow meters has been advocated for the homeassessment of chronic asthma. The role of the peakflow meter in young children is controversial.Infants and young children who cannot force-fully exhale on command cannot use peak flow meters. The numeric output is effort-dependent,and even older school-aged children who areunfamiliar with the peak flow meter may notperform adequately to give useful information inthe ED. Experienced older school-aged asthmat-ics may provide useful information from peakflow assessment in the ED. Reliance on peak flowperformance in other children is problematic atbest and may be misleading. Treatment principles There are several general treatment principlesthat apply to all children with difficulty breathing. General treatment O xygenation R espiratory support Anticipate dehydration Identify cases that require a procedureOxygenation Ensuring adequate oxygenation is an important principle in managing children with difficultybreathing. Oxygenation can be assessed non-invasively using pulse oximetry. Oxygen deliverycan be achieved in a relatively non-threateningmanner with the parent holding oxygen tubingnear the patient's face (\"blow by\"). Alternatively,infant and child-sized oxygen delivery tubing andmasks can be used. Respiratory support Although a child may have adequate oxygena- tion, this is not the same as adequate ventilation.The child may not be able to overcome excessivework of breathing and may fatigue. In theseinstances, although the pulse oximetry readingsmay be adequate, the carbon dioxide level is ris-ing. This rise in carbon dioxide may lead to men-tal status changes, decreased respiratory rate,and finally bradycardia and apnea. If a childpresents in respiratory failure or is apneic, imme-diate ventilatory assistance with a bag-valve-mask is indicated. If a child is more slowlydeteriorating, a trial of non-invasive ventilatorysupport such as nasal continuous positive air-way pressure (CPAP) or a bi-level positive airwaypressure (BiPAP) mask may be tried. Ultimately,a child in respiratory failure will need to be endo-tracheally intubated and placed on mechanicalventilation. If at all possible, the emergencyphysician should have all appropriate personneland equipment for intubation readily available inanticipation of respiratory failure. Anticipate dehydration Achild who has an increased work of breathing will have increased fluid losses from the lungs. These children typically have difficulty feeding andtaking in adequate fluid volume. In general, chil-dren become dehydrated more rapidly than adultsdue to higher metabolic demands and decreasedintake. IV access should be obtained early in the EDcourse unless discharging the child home is consid-ered after the initial evaluation. If the child appearsto be in shock, volume support with 20 ml/kgboluses of normal saline is indicated. Identify cases that require a procedure Identifying foreign bodies may be straightforward or subtle. Once identified, all aspirated foreignbodies and most high esophageal coins will need Shortness of breath in children 512 Primary Complaintsremoval usually by a consultant. Retropharyngeal abscesses are usually drained by ENT consultants. Young infants are obligate nasal breathers and typ- ically feed with a nipple in their mouth for severalminutes without interruption. Nasal passage nar-rowing from nasal mucus or a viral upper respira- tory tract infection may disrupt feeding and causea surprising degree of distress in a neonate oryoung infant. Bulb suctioning the nose may behelpful in clearing secretions and may result indramatic improvement in the ease of breathingand feeding for these babies. Specific treatment Asthma Asthma has been increasing both in prevalence and severity for the past few decades. There areseveral treatments for acute exacerbations ofasthma that can be life-saving. The two majorpathophysiologic components of acute asthmaexacerbations are bronchospasm and airwayinflammation. The primary treatments are directedtoward these features. Bronchospasm is cur-rently treated with albuterol, a relatively beta-2 specific bronchodilator. There are two mainmethods of delivery that seem to have similarefficacy. Albuterol may be administered as a neb-ulized solution or as an inhaler with a spacer(and mask in young infants). P ublished doses are controversial. In a sense, children will drive the dosing through their pulmonary tidal volume.Inflammation is primarily treated with steroids.Commonly administered steroids include pred- prednisolone, methylprednisolone, anddexamethasone. The dosing is typically 2 mg/kg/day once daily (or divided into two equaldoses) for 5 days for outpatients, except dexam-ethasone which is dosed from 0.15 to 0.6 mg/kg/dose for 2 days. It is commonly thought that inpatients who can take oral medications, oralsteroids are as effective as IV steroids. Bronchiolitis Bronchiolitis is a clinical syndrome that comprises a group of presumed viral lung infections in chil-dren. Although many cases are thought to be dueto RSV , a substantial percentage of clinically indis-tinguishable cases test negative. As bronchiolitis is not a uniform disease, treatment responses arevariable and the literature is varied with regardto treatment recommendations. Options includesteroids, beta-agonists, and nebulized epinephrine.The effectiveness of steroids is thought to be high-est in cases where the child has underlying reac-tive airway disease (usually bronchopulmonarydysplasia or asthma). For a child with allergies andeczema, steroids may be effective therapy if he orshe has br onchiolitis. The dosing of the steroids is thesame as for asthma: 2 mg/kg/day once daily (or divided into two equal doses) for 5 days. Beta- agonists seem to work for some children and not for others. A trial of two or three nebulizedalbuterol treatments may be undertaken in the ED.If effective, treatment may be continued as an out-patient using an inhaler with a spacer and mask oras an inpatient with a nebulizer. If ineffective, fur-ther treatments are not usually helpful. The use ofnebulized epinephrine is currently controversial.Clinical experience suggests that some childrenrespond well to nebulized epinephrine (at least transiently) while others do not. However,recently performed, well-designed studies have failed to show a significant benefit. Antiviral treat-ment (e.g., with ribavirin) has no role in the ED. Croup The treatment of croup is based on the severity of symptoms. A child with only a history of a barkycough with no demonstrable cough in the ED istypically discharged for observation at home. Achild with a demonstrable barky cough and nostridor at rest is treated with steroids as an out-patient. Historically a single dose of dexametha- sone has been given. There is great controversyover the dosing and route of administration ofdexamethasone for croup. In all likelihood, thiscontroversy exists because the dosing and routeof administration do not matter. Dosing rangesfrom 0.15 to 0.6 mg/kg, and the routes includeoral, intramuscular, and nebulized. Based onstudies from the late 1980s and early 1990s,0.6 mg/kg of dexamethasone has been givenintramuscularly. Other routes and dosing areclearly acceptable. If a child has a demonstrablebarky cough and stridor at rest, nebulized epi-nephrine may be administered in addition todexamethasone. The dose of nebulized solutionis 0.05 ml/kg (up to 0.5 ml) of 2.25% racemic epi-nephrine diluted in 3 ml of normal saline. Sinceonly half of the racemic epinephrine solution isbiologically active : 1000 in every \"crash cart\", nebulized 1 : 1000epinephrine is now being used at a dose of0.5 ml/kg (up to 5 ml) diluted in 3 ml of normalsaline. If there is no prompt resolution of the stridorat rest, admission is typically warranted. If the Primary Complaints 513Shortness of breath in childrenstridor at rest resolves after a nebulized epineph- rine treatment, the child is usually observed inthe ED for 2-3 hours. If stridor at rest returns, thechild requires admission. If stridor at rest doesnot return, discharge home from the ED is usu-ally appropriate. Although cool mist has beenadvocated and used historically, clinical efficacy isdoubtful and a recent, well-designed study sug-gested no demonstrable benefit. There has beenconcern that treated with nebulized epi- nephrine would \"rebound\" and substantiallyworsen after an initial period of clinical improve-ment; this is now considered a myth. Pneumonia The treatment of pneumonia in children is pri- marily based on the likely etiology given the ageof the child. Children rarely produce sputum,blood cultures are rarely positive in childrenwith pneumonia, and the specific etiology ofpneumonia in children is rarely determined bymicrobiologic means. In neonates, pneumonia istreated like all potentially serious bacterial infec-tions with intravenous ampicillin (100 mg/kgper dose) and cefotaxime (100 mg/kg per dose)and admission to the hospital. In young infants,particularly those with minimal temperature ele-vation, repetitive coughing, and a history of con-junctivitis, Chlamydia is the presumed etiology, and treatment is with IV or oral erythromycin(10 mg/kg per dose four times per day). For chil-dren between the first few months of life and 5years of age, the most likely bacterial etiology oflobar pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae . Treatment for this age group is with IV cefuroxime (50 mg/kg per dose) for children admitted to thehospital or oral amoxicillin (45 mg/kg per dosetwice daily) for children discharged home fromthe ED. Presumed viral pneumonia (clinically indis tinguishable from bacterial and along the spectrum of bronchiolitis) is not treated withantibiotics. So-called \"atypical\" pneumonia ismost common in children older than 5 years of age,and macrolide antibiotics (such as azithromycin10 mg/kg on day 1 - not to exceed 500 mg - and5mg/kg once daily for 4 subsequent days - not to exceed 250 mg per day) are appropriate. Themost common reason for children outside theneonatal period to be admitted is hypoxia. Thepulse oximetry threshold that determines clini-cally significant hypoxia warranting admissionis unknown. It has been suggested that childrenwith room air pulse oximetry readings below90-92% should be admitted to the hospital.Special patients Bronchopulmonary dysplasia Former premature infants, particularly thosewith lung disease identified in the neonatal inten-sive care unit and those with prolonged mechan-ical ventilation, may have bronchopulmonarydysplasia. These children have reactive airwaysand often wheeze when they get upper respira-tory tract infections. If they develop bronchiolitis,particularly if they test positive for RSV , they canhave particularly severe disease and may progressto respiratory failure. Similarly, pneumonia thatis well-tolerated by other makechildren with bronchopulmonary genetic, cystic fibrosis pri-marily manifests as a lung disorder. These chil- dren have frequent lung infections and may have relatively unusual pneumonias caused by Gram-negative or ganisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Sickle cell disease Achild with sickle cell disease may develop acute chest syndrome . These children typically present with fever, cough, and chest pain. They may ormay not be hypoxic. In most instances, it is diffi-cult to distinguish lung infarction from a bacter-ial pneumonia; the two conditions may co-exist.These children are usually admitted to the hospi-tal for hydration, analgesia and pain control, andparenteral antibiotics. Children with tracheostomies with tracheostomies may have mechani-cal complications. Tracheostomy dislodgment maylead to cardiopulmonary arrest. Plugging of thetracheostomy tube with mucus may occur andlead to profound respiratory distress. Disposition Consultation Subspecialty consultation is infrequently neededin cases of children with difficulty breathing.Consultation (usually from an ENT specialist ora pediatric surgeon) for the removal of aspiratedor esophageal foreign bodies is usually indicated. Shortness of breath in children 514 Primary ComplaintsENT surgeons are usually consulted to drain retropharyngeal abscesses in the operating room. Emergency physicians often perform needledrainage of peritonsillar abscesses in the ED. Monitoring For moderately-ill children, it is sometimes diffi-cult to predict whether they will improve or deteriorate. Close monitoring with frequent re-examinations and continuous pulse oximetry isprudent. Anticipating and r esponding to r espira- tory distress is a key management principle. Intensive care unit admissions Any child who is endotracheally intubated will beadmitted to an intensive care setting. Other chil-dren in whom it is desirable to aggressively treatwithout intubation (particularly asthmatics) mayalso be appropriate for the intensive care unit. Anycase where impending airway compromise is aserious consideration (e.g., epiglottitis, retropha-ryngeal abscess, bacterial tracheitis) should beadmitted to the intensive care unit. Cases inwhich the condition is worsening but may notprogress to respiratory failure (e.g., hydrocarbonaspirations and near-drowning) may also beappropriate for the intensive care unit. Ward admissions Children who are dehydrated and require IV flu-ids should be admitted to the hospital. Childrenwith croup and stridor at rest 2 hours after treat-ment with nebulized epinephrine should be admit-ted.Children with pneumonia who are suspected of being septic should be admitted to the hospi-tal. Young children with bronchiolitis who areslowly worsening should be admitted. Asthmatic children who require nebulized beta-agonist ther-apy more frequently than every 3 or 4 hoursshould strongly be considered for admission tothe hospital. Due to a risk of apnea, an infant witha history and examination consistent with pertus-sisshould be admitted for observation. Although the specific pulse oximetry value which consti-tutes clinically significant hypoxia is controver-sial, in general, hypoxic children should be givenoxygen and admitted to the hospital. Discharges Most children with difficulty breathing can be discharged home after tr eatment in the ED, a prescription for medicine to take at home, andreassurance. Croup that is improving and does not produce stridor at rest can typically be dischargedhome. Most asthmatics can be treated with oralsteroids and beta-agonist therapy and dischargedhome. Children with esophageal coins in or dis-tal to the stomach can be discharged home. Mostchildren with bronchiolitis can be treated as out-patients. If a near-drowning patient has a clearchest X-ray and normal oxygenation after severalhours of observation, discharge home with closeparental supervision is usually appropriate. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Pearls RSV bronchiolitis in young infants mayinitially present with apnea Before the onset of wheezing, infants in the first few months of life may present after a brief periodof apnea. Inspiratory/expiratory and decubitus chest X-rays may help identify cases of foreignbody aspiration More than 80% of aspirated foreign bodies are not directly visible on X-ray. Indirect findingsshould be sought. Due to a ball-valve mecha-nism, air trapping occurs on the side with the for-eign body. Unilateral hyperexpansion may beseen on the chest X-ray and this phenomenonmay be exaggerated in an expiratory or decubi-tus film. A child in moderately severe respiratory distress should be allowed to assume a position of comfort unless you are ready to aggressively manage the airway Although we often remove children from their parents' arms to perform parts of the physicalexamination, agitating a child with a tenuous air-way may lead to airway occlusion. Aggressive andprompt airway management may be required. Ifnot prepared to immediately manage the airwayof a young infant, keep the child in a position ofcomfort until a definitive management plan is inplace. Primary Complaints 515Shortness of breath in childrenSevere asthma may present without wheezing due to poor air exchange In order to make the musical sound of wheezing, enough air has to pass through the airways. Noair movement, no sound. A decrease in pulse oximetry does not necessarily indicate a worsening clinicalcondition in an asthmatic just startingbronchodilator therapy in the ED As bronchodilator therapy is initiated, areas of lung that were previously \"shut down\" open up.There is a lag between the time when the bloodflow normalizes in a region of lung and when the airways open up. A transient ventilation-perfusion mismatch develops and the patient'soxygenation may actually fall briefly beforeimproving. Pitfalls Slowing respirations may imply gettingbetter or getting worse As a patient improves, tachypnea usually nor- malizes. However, if a patient is worsening anddeveloping respiratory fatigue, their respiratoryrate will also fall. A slower respiratory rate has tobe assessed in relation to the overall clinicalappearance of the child. Vomiting and hydrocarbon ingestion Hydrocarbons in the stomach and intestines are usually well-tolerated. Hydrocarbons in the lungscan cause a devastating chemical pneumonitis.Vomiting offers another chance for the hydrocar- bon to go into the lungs. Myths Wheezing means asthma Afrequently repeated mantra is that \"all that wheezes is not asthma.\" Other conditions such as aspirated foreign bodies, chemical pneumonitis, bronchiolitis, and gastroesophageal reflux oftencause wheezing. All wheezing children need albuterol Atrial of a bronchodilator is a reasonable inter- vention in young children with wheezing and res- piratory distress. However, if the cause is notasthma, bronchodilators are often ineffective. If achild improves with a bronchodilator, it is reason-able to continue with additional doses. If a childhas a foreign body or chemical pneumonitis,repeated doses of bronchodilators are not indi- cated. Although commonly administered, theeffectiveness of bronchodilators in many cases ofbronchiolitis is K. Bronchiolitis. In: Strange GR,Ahrens Lelyveld S, (eds).

Shortness of breath in children 516 Primary ComplaintsPrimary Complaints 517Syncope Scope of the problem Syncope is defined as a transient loss of con- sciousness and postural tone caused by an abruptdecrease in cerebral perfusion, with subsequentspontaneous recovery. When recovery occurs priorto complete loss of consciousness, the episode isreferred to as pre- or near-syncope. Syncope and pre-syncope are generally considered the samecondition at different points along a continuum.Therefore, the emergency department (ED) evalu-ation and work-up for both is similar. Syncope is a common presenting complaint in the ED. It accounts for approximately 1-3% ofED visits and 1-6% of hospital admissions. Asmuch as $750 million per year is spent in the USto diagnose and treat syncope. The differentialdiagnosis of syncope includes both benign andlife-threatening etiologies. Emergency physiciansmust have a sound knowledge of diagnostic con-siderations in order to perform an adequate andcost-effective work-up and make appropriatedisposition decisions. Pathophysiology Consciousness is maintained through the properfunctioning of the cerebral hemispheres and thereticular activating system (RAS). Syncope occurs when there is dysfunction of either both cerebralhemispheres or the RAS. Proper function of thesestructures depends on cerebral metabolism anddelivery of oxygen and glucose. Disruption of thismetabolism can occur because of generalized sys-temic hypoperfusion (e.g., cardiac dysrhythmia,hypovolemia with orthostasis), localized cerebralhypoperfusion ischemia attack,stroke), systemic hypoxia, or hypoglycemia. History Syncope has many causes, some benign and others life-threatening. As many as 45% of casesof syncope remain undiagnosed after a standardwork-up. However, most diagnoses that aremade are established during the initial work-up in theED. Only a minority of cases are diagnosed dur-ing inpatient admission. Therefore, a thoroughhistory, physical examination, and work-up in theED are crucial in order to maximize the chances ofproperly identifying the cause of syncope. What were you doing when you \"passed out?\" Asudden change in position from supine to orthostatic However,syncope while supine indicates a cardiac etiologyor a seizure (not a true cause of syncope, but gen-erally included in the differential diagnosis).Syncope during exertion may also indicate ortho-static syncope, but may instead be caused by car-diac outflow obstruction (e.g., hypertrophiccardiomyopathy or aortic stenosis). Syncope asso-ciated with sudden head-turning, tight neck col-lars, or shaving the neck may be caused by carotid sinus hypersensitivity. Syncope that occurs sh ortly after exposure to pain or that is associated withstrong emotions (e.g., fear, anxiety) is usuallyknown as vasovagal to decreased venous return to theheart and decreased cardiac output. What symptoms do you remember just before you \"passed out?\"What symptomsdid you experience after you woke up? Severe headache around the time of the syncopal episode suggests intracranial bleed, especiallysubarachnoid hemorrhage. Chest pain, palpita-tions, or dyspnea suggest etiolo-gies, as acute coronary syndrome (ACS),dysrhythmia, pericardial tamponade, or aorticdissection; or a pulmonary pul-monary embolism (PE). Aortic dissection is oftenaccompanied by upper back pain. Abdominal orlow back pain may indicate a ruptured abdominalaortic aneurysm (AAA) ectopic pregnancy. Asense of \"tunnel vision\" just syncopalepisode In con- trast, the absence of any prodromal symptoms is often associated with a dysrhythmia. If the patient describes an aura, a seizure is the probablecause of the episode. Patients reporting a pro-drome of lightheadedness, nausea, di aphoresis, and tremulousness should be evaluated forhypoglycemia. Were there any witnesses? Witnesses to the episode can be helpful in distin- guishing between some causes of syncope. Witnesses should be questioned regarding the duration of unconsciousness. True syncope is gen- erally associated with unconsciousness lasting nomore than seconds to minutes. Prolonged uncon-sciousness before waking is more likely due to aseizure (postictal state) or drug effects (e.g., alco-hol). Witnesses may report \"seizure\" activity.Tonic-clonic movements lasting for several seconds are common in cases of syncope; how-ever, if the movements last more than 20-30 sec-onds, a seizure is the more likely cause. Witnessesshould also be questioned regarding the mentalstatus of the patient after waking. Seizures areassociated with postictal confusion lasting morethan 5 minutes. Syncope, on the other hand, isassociated with a rapid return to a normal level ofconsciousness. Witnesses may also be helpful indescribing the patient's activities and complaintsimmediately before and after the syncopal episode. Have you been feeling ill lately? Recent nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or diarrhea may suggest orthostatic syncope due to intravas-cular volume depletion. If the patient has hadabdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea, specificquestions pertaining to hematemesis or melenamay indicate gastrointestinal blood acause of orthostatic syncope. Anemia from chr onic blood loss is associated with a more prolongedsense of fatigue, malaise, and dyspnea with exer-tion. Recent episodes of chest pain or palpitationsmay indicate a cardiac cause of syncope. Recentabdominal or back pain during the days precedingthe syncopal episode may suggest an expandingAAA or ectopic pregnancy prior to rupture. What medications have you been taking? Any drugs or alcohol? Many medications have been implicated in inducing syncope (Table 35.1). The primarymechanism through which medication-inducedsyncope occurs is from excessive bradycardia orvasodilation. Patients that abuse illicit drugs andalcohol may also report that they \"passed out.\"The period of unconsciousness associated withthese drugs and alcohol is more prolonged beforerecovery than most other causes of syncope. Alchohol consumption, even in moderation,causes vasodilation and therefore predisposesindividuals to syncope from other causes as well. Has this ever happened before? Did you see a doctor? Was there any work-up? Many types of benign syncope have a repeated pattern of occurrence. However, some of the life-threatening causes of syncope can also be associ-ated with prior episodes, including dysrhythmias,hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and aortic sten-osis. Information from prior or exclude some life-threatening etiologies(e.g., prior pathy aortic will help risk-stratify patients forsuspected ACS). Has any member of your family died suddenly? Some of the life-threatening causes of JervellLang-Nielson, Romano-Ward Brugada syndromes are associated with a family historyof sudden death. Also, there may be a familypredilection for In: Rosen P , et al. (eds). Emergency Medicine: Concepts and Clinical Practice . St. Louis: Mosby-Y ear Book, 1998.Primary Complaints 519SyncopeEmergency physicians should have a lower threshold to perform a more extensive work-upin patients who report this family history. Associated symptoms Cardiopulmonary Chest or upper back pain prior to or following the syncopal episode warrant strong consider-ation for ACS, aortic dissection, suggest a dysrhythmia. Neurologic The presence of a headache (especially of abrupt onset) prior to the syncopal episode suggests thepossibility of intracranial hemorrhage, most com-monly SAH. The presence of a headache afterrecovery is less specific, as many patients will report a post-syncopal (or post-seizure) headache. However, if the headache is severe or persistent,intracranial hemorrhage should be ruled out.Diplopia, dysarthria, ataxia, or orafter the posterior cir-culation stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).Any neurologic complaint that is accompanied bychest or upper back pain should be considered anaortic dissection until proven otherwise. Gastrointestinal The presence of nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or diarrhea may suggest orthostatic syncope due tointravascular volume depletion. Hematemesis orblood in the bowel movements indicates gastroin-testinal blood loss causing orthostatic syncope. Abdominal or low back pain may indicate a rup-tured AAA. Gynecologic Ruptured ectopic pregnancy can cause sufficient blood loss to induce orthostatic syncope. Theabrupt pain from a ruptured ectopic pregnancycan syncope. Clues to ectopic pregnancy includeknown or suspected first-trimester pregnancy,irregular vaginal bleeding, and abdominal, pel vic, or low back pain. Frequent and heavy vaginalbleeding can induce severe anemia and also leadto orthostatic syncope.Extremities Leg pain or swelling suggests deep (DVT) and syncope due to PE. Leg painmay be caused by acute vascular insufficiency,often associated with aortic dissection or AAA.Unilateral extremity weakness suggests a cerebro-vascular cause of syncope. Past medical Cardiovascular Cardiac risk factors increase the likelihood of car- diac causes of syncope, especially ACS and dysrhythmia. Hypertension and atheroscleroticcoronary vascular disease also predispose to aor-tic dissection and AAA, respectively. Ahistory of previous dysrhythmias warrants for recurrent atrial or ventricular dys-rhythmias. Ahistory syn-cope with exertion. Valvular ruptureor worsening incompetence may cause syncopefrom decreased cardiac output. Pulmonary Patients who report recent surgeries, recent or cur- rent pregnancy, or other risk factors for thrombo- embolism should be evaluated for possible PE.Prior episodes of DVT or PE also predisposeindividuals to recurrent PE. Physical examination Acomprehensive physical examination should be performed in all patients with syncope. Emphasisshould be placed on the cardiovascular and neu-rologic examinations. General appearance If the patient appears pale, ashen, or diaphoretic atthe time of presentation, consider a life-threateningcause of syncope. Intravascular volume depletionwith shock due to a ruptured AAA or ectopicpregnancy, aortic dissection, gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, or severe dehydration are diag- nostic possibilities. Shock may also be caused byan ACS or persisting dysrhythmia.Vital signs Hypotension indicates significant intravascular volume depletion or cardiogenic shock due toACS or dysrhythmia. The heart rate can alsoindicate the presence of a brady- or tachy-dysrhythmia. A rapid heart rate may be causedby a dysrhythmia, or it may be a compensatoryresponse to shock. Tachypnea is nonspecific, but may be a marker for PE or shock. A fingerstickglucose and pulse oximetry should be obtainedas part of the routine vital sign assessment inpatients with syncope as well. If the fingerstickglucose is noted to be low during the initial eval-uation, hypoglycemia-induced syncope is sug-gested. This diagnosis should only be made if thehistory is supportive (the patient exercised with-out eating for many hours, for example). Uncon-sciousness due to insulin-induced hypoglycemia is unlikely to resolve without administration ofexogenous glucose. Hypoxia noted on pulseoximetry suggests PE. Orthostatic vital signs are often checked in patients with syncope. However, they have poor sensitivity and specificity forintravascular volume depletion, especially in eld-erly patients. Up to 30% of cardiac-related syn-cope cases will have positive orthostatic vital sign changes (heart rate increase of more than 30 beats per minute or systolic blood pressure fall of morethan 20 mmHg). Fever or mild hypothermia mayoccur in sepsis. Low-grade fevers may also occurin patients with PE. Head and neck The head and neck should be assessed for signsof trauma that may have occurred during thesyncopal episode. Pupillary or facial asymmetrymay indicate a cerebrovascular cause of syncope.On the other hand, bilateral pupillary constric-tion or dilation may indicate a medication effector most narcotics assessed symmetryand bruits. Some authors have suggested carotidsinus massage (CSM) to assess for carotid sinushypersensitivity. However, this should only be done in patients who have a history sug-gestive of this diagnosis (e.g., syncope whileshaving) and in whom the risk of carotid ath-erosclerotic plaques is negligible. The mouthshould be assessed for evidence of tongue-biting,more commonly discovered after seizures than syncope.Cardiovascular The cardiac examination is the most importantpart of the examination in patients presenting withsyncope. The ventricular rate should be assessed,and may indicate the presence of a tachy- orbradydysrhythmia. The regularity of the heartrhythm should also be assessed. An irregular rhythm suggests atrial fibrillation, premature complexes, or second-degree atrioventricular (AV)block. Beware, however, that a normal heart rateand rhythm does not exclude the possibility thatthe patient's episode of syncope the carotid arteries. Hypertrophic cardiomyo-pathy is also associated with a systolic murmur,but the intensity is greatest at the lower sternalborder or apex. The intensity of the murmur ofhypertrophic cardiomyopathy generally increaseswith Valsalva maneuvers and decreases withTrendelenburg positioning and squatting. The vascular examination is crucial as well. Assessfor equal upper and lower extremity pulses.Unequal pulses in the upper extremities may sug-gest aortic dissection in the right clinical scenario. Pulmonary Abnormal lung sounds suggest a pulmonary causeof syncope. Rales can be caused by pulmonaryedema due to or infarction.Focal wheezes can be caused by PE. Diffusewheezes may be due to multiple pulmonaryemboli or pulmonary edema. Abdomen The abdomen should be assessed for tenderness.Consider a ruptured AAA or ectopic pregnancy inthe patient with syncope who has abdominal ten-derness. An enlarged pulsatile abdominal aorta issometimes appreciated in cases of aortic aneurysm. Pelvic The pelvic examination is useful in the patient inwhom ruptured ectopic pregnancy is a consider-ation. Any female patient of childbearing agewith syncope who reports pelvic or abdominalpain, vaginal bleeding, or is known to be preg-nant in the first- or second-trimester should havea pelvic examination to assess for vaginal bleed-ing, adnexal masses, or adnexal and uterine ten-derness.

(continued )Diagnostic testing Aroutine \"shotgun\" approach to diagnostic test- ing in the patient with syncope wastes valuable time and resources. The electrocardiogram (ECG)is perhaps the only diagnostic test that is rou-tinely indicated in these patients . All other tests should be obtained based on concerns raisedduring the detailed history and physical exam-ination. Electrocardiogram The ECG should be considered a routine part ofthe ED evaluation of the patient presenting withsyncope. The emergency physician should evalu-atethe ECG for evidence of tachydysrhythmias, bradydysrhythmias, and AV blocks. The presenceof any of these abnormalities suggests a dysrhyth-mia as the cause of the syncopal episode. The ECGshould also be evaluated for evidence of acutemyocardial ischemia (ST-segment elevation ordepression, inverted T-waves, or new intraventric-ular conduction abnormalities or bundle branch blocks). PE may be associated with an assortmentof ECG abnormalities, including sinus tachycardia,inverted T-waves (especially in the right precor-dial leads), a rightward axis, Q-waves in lead III,and tall R-waves in lead V 1(Figure 35.1). The ECG may have none of these findings.

Close attention should bepaid to the ECG intervals. A short PR interval in combination with a slightly prolonged QRSinterval and delta-waves is diagnostic ofWolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (Figure 35.3) and increases the likelihood of tachyarrhyth-mias. Prolongation of the QT interval, which maybe congenital, or caused by electrolyte abnormal- ities or medications, predisposes aVFV1 V2V5 V6V3V4 Figure 35.1 ECG in a patient with pulmonary embolism demonstrating the classic S 1Q3T3 pattern and rightward axis shift.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the with Doppler respectively. Non-specific as prematureatrial or ventricular complexes, sinus tachycardia,and first-degree AV block, have no diagnosticsignificance. Laboratory studies In general, laboratory studies should only beordered when the history or physical examin-ation suggests a likely abnormality. Glucose Routine serum glucose testing is of low yield if the patient is asymptomatic on arrival to the ED.However, in the patient with persistent light-headedness, nausea, tremulousness, or diaphore-sis, or a patient with diabetes, a fingerstick glucoseis warranted. Complete blood count The complete blood count (CBC) is rarely helpful in evaluating patients with syncope. The white blood cell count is nonspecific. Hemoglobin and hematocrit testing are useful when the history orphysical examination suggests blood loss (most commonly from a gastrointestinal or vaginalsource). Patients with renal failure, humanimmunodeficiency virus, sickle cell anemia, andother chronic diseases may be predisposed toanemia and warrant routine CBC testing. Electrolytes Routine electrolyte testing is rarely helpful in the evaluation of the patient with syncope. However,patients who use diuretics or have protractedvomiting and/or diarrhea probably warrant elec-trolyte testing. Emergency physicians should havea low threshold for obtaining electrolytes in eld-erly patients, as they are more likely to have signif-icant abnormalities. Pregnancy test Female patients of childbearing age who present with abdominal or pelvic pain, low back pain, orvaginal bleeding should be tested for pregnancy.However, in the absence of any of these symp-toms, pregnancy testing is unlikely to be helpful. Radiologic studies Routine radiologic imaging for patients with syn-cope is not indicated. However, the history andSyncopephysical examination will help determine which patients require imaging. Chest radiography Routine chest radiography is not cost-effective and rarely leads to a definitive diagnosis.Patients who complain of dyspnea, chest pain, orupper back pain, or who are noted on examina-tion to be hypoxic, tachypneic, or have abnormallung sounds should receive chest radiography toevaluate for signs of PE. The most common find-ings in PE include elevation of a hemidiaphragm,atelectasis, and small pleural ef fusions; less com- mon pulmonary infiltrates andperipheral oligemia. The chest radiograph mayalso display evidence of congestive heart failure(CHF) associated with ACS, large pericardialeffusions (massive cardiomegaly, water bottle-shaped heart), and aortic dissection in patientswith chest or upper back pain (widened mediastinum, left pleural effusion, blurring ofthe aortic knob, rightward tracheal deviation,pleural cap). Computerized tomography of the chest Patients with suspected aortic dissection or PE based on history and physical examination sh ould have diagnostic imaging of the great vessels orlungs, respectively. Computerized tomography(CT) is emerging as the diagnostic test of choicefor both conditions, in part due to the accessibil-ity of CT in most EDs. However, emergencyphysicians should remember that the test is not100% sensitive; therefore, if clinical suspicion ofeither diagnosis is high, further testing may beindicated even after a negative CT. Computerized tomography of the brain Patients who experience syncope after recent head trauma should receive CT of the brain.Emergency physicians should also consider CTof the brain in patients who experience headtrauma during the syncopal episode, althoughstudies evaluating the utility of the test in this situ-ation are lacking. Any patient with syncope whoexperiences a severe headache prior to or after the syncopal episode should have brain CT. Also,patients who experience new seizures, report focalneurologic symptoms, or have new focal neuro-logic deficits on examination should have emer-gent CT of the brain. Overall, neurologic causes ofsyncope are rare, especially in the patient withoutfocal neurologic symptoms or deficits. Routinebrain CT is not indicated in such patients. Echocardiography Emergent echocardiography is indicated only incases of suspected pericardial tamponade.Echocardiography may also be helpful in evaluat-ing wall motion abnormalities in cases of ACS orright heart strain in cases of massive PE; however,the test is rarely required for diagnosis of eithercondition in the ED. Echocardiography is alsodiagnostic for aortic stenosis and hypertrophiccardiomyopathy, but obtaining the test emer-gently for either condition is rarely necessary. General treatment principles Due to the many life-threatening etiologies of syn- cope, tr eatment should begin with assessment of the Airway, Breathing, and Circulation (ABCs).Once initial stabilization has occurred, furthertreatment will be guided by the presumed etiology.Patie nts with an uncertain diagnosis should be monitored and observed in the ED. Bed railsshould be maintained in an upright position inthe event of a seizure, and placement of an IVline is prudent in case emergent medications arerequired. Special patients Elderly Geriatric patients are well known to present withatypical symptoms and signs, even in the presenceof deadly diseases. A majority of patients morethan 75 years of age present with a chief complaintof dyspnea rather than chest pain when theyexperience ACS. Some geriatric patients will alsoexperience painless aortic dissection. Ge riatric patients are more likely than younger patients tohave many of the cardiovascular causes of syncope:ACS, dysrhythmias, aortic rupturedAAA, and cardiac medications mayblunt the expected tachycardic response to acuteblood loss, and this population is pr one to false- positive and false-negative orthostatic vital signs. Polypharmacy is common in this population aswell, increasing the likelihood of medication-related syncope. Elderly patients are more likely to have electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, and Syncope 528 Primary Complaintsintracranial abnormalities. Elderly patients also experience a much higher mortality from theircauses of syncope. As a result, emergency phys-icians must maintain a low threshold to orderlaboratory studies (including car diac), obtain CT of the brain, and admit geriatric patients who pre- sent after a syncopal episode. Pacemakers Patients with artificial cardiac pacemakers thatpresent with syncope should generally have atleast 24 hours of cardiac monitoring and evalu-ation for pacemaker malfunction. This usuallyrequires admission and cardiologist consultation. Pregnant Patients who are pregnant, especially duringtheir second and third trimester, are prone to vaso- motor and orthostatic syncope. However, preg- nancy also increases the risk for PE. Therefore,pregnant patients who present with or after syn-cope should be evaluated for PE if they aretachypneic, hypoxic, or report chest pain. Pediatric Syncope in pediatric patients is rare. The mostcommon causes are vasomotor syncope and syn-cope related to dehydration. whoreport exertional syncope should be assessed for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Disposition Admission All patients with a suspected cardiovascular, pul-monary, or neurologic cause of syncope should beadmitted. Patients with cardiac risk factors shouldbe considered for admission for cardiac monitor-ing. Although there is no specific age cutoff forroutine admission of patients experiencing syn- cope, most authors recommend that patientsmore than 45-50 years of age should be stronglyconsidered for routine admission in order tomonitor for an ACS or dysrhythmia. It should benoted, however, that patients with isolated syn-cope and no other symptoms, signs, or ECG find-ings suggestive of ACS are extremely unlikely tohave positive cardiac enzymes during theiradmission. Clinical rules have been studied todetermine those patients with syncope who are atrisk for serious short-term outcomes. Althoughthese decision rules were derived from a cohort inwhom not all studies were obtained, they havebeen prospectively validated and make excellentsense (Table 35.3). Immediate surgical/obstetric consultation Patients with suspected aortic dissection, rup- tured AAA, and pericardi al tamponade warrant immediate surgical consul tation. Patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy should have imme- diate obstetric consultation. All patients withsurgical causes of syncope should receive twolarge-bore IV lines, a broad panel of \"pre-op labs,\"and a type and cross for at least 4 units of blood. Discharge The most common cause of syncope in youngpatients with a normal physical examination isvasomotor syncope. Patients with this benigncondition can be discharged for outpatient follow-up. These patients should be counseled to maintainadequate hydration, as hypovolemia increasesthe likelihood of syncope. Patients should also becounseled to immediately lie down if they beginto experience a similar prodrome as that whichpreceded their syncopal episode. In general, allpatients who are discharged after a syncopalepisode should follow-up with a primary-carephysician or cardiologist for reevaluation within1 week. In addition, patients should be counseledto avoid swimming, playing sports, driving, oroperating any heavy machinery until furtherevaluation by their physician.

Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Pearls Abrupt onset of syncope without anyprodromal symptoms should prompt strongsuspicion of a dysrhythmia. Up to 30% of cardiac-related syncope cases have positive orthostatic vital signchanges. The ECG is useful not only for evaluation of myocardial ischemia and dysrhythmias,but also for evaluation QT syndrome,hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and theBrugada syndrome. Pitfalls Gastrointestinal bleeding may missedbecause of failure to perform a rectalexamination. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may bemissed because of failure to detect a murmur(or changes in the murmur with provocativemaneuvers) in a young patient. PE is commonly undiagnosed as a cause ofsyncope. Myths CT of the head should be performed on allpatients that present after syncope. Serum electrolyte and CBC testing must beperformed on all patients who present aftersyncope. Orthostatic vital sign abnormalities arehighly specific for dehydration and rule outcardiac causes of syncope.References 1.Atkins D, Hanusa B, Sefcik T, orthostatic hypotension.

The demographics ofhuman poisoning show two peaks of exposure.The first peak is in children from 1 to 3 years of agereflecting accidental ingestions. The second peak is in the elderly due to the increased risk of toxi-city from multiple prescription drugs. Intentionaloverdose for abuse or suicidal intent is seenthroughout the adolescent and adult populations. The most common exposures are cleaning agents and over-the-counter analgesics (aceta-minophen (APAP), ibuprofen, etc.). The agentsresponsible for fatalities are analgesics, antidepressants, cardiovascular agents, and drugsof abuse. Carbon monoxide (CO) and drugs ofabuse are responsible for many deaths that arenever reported to a poison control center (PCC).Data show that analgesics, antidepressants, andcardiovascular agents are also associated withsignificant morbidity and mortality. Most patients who are poisoned will recover with supportive care alone. However, some mayrequire specific antidotes or other therapeutics under the guidance of a regional PCC or medicaltoxicologist. The identification and treatment of poisoning emergencies is part of the uniqueand specialized knowledge of emergency medi-cine physicians and medical toxicologists. Emer-gency physicians are on the front line of caringfor these patients and must be familiar with theprinciples of common poisoning diagnosis andmanagement. Pathophysiology There are three basic physiologic conceptsrequired to understand the effects of toxic agents on the human body: absorption, distribution, andelimination. In addition, each toxic substance hasspecific mechanisms of toxicity and effects onorgan systems which will not be described in this chapter but can be found in several of the references. Absorption is defined as the process by which a drug or chemical enters the body. Drugs can beabsorbed through a variety of different pathways,including the lungs, skin, muscle tissue, oralmucosa, stomach, intestine, rectal mucosa, andeyes. The route of absorption directly affects itsrate and extent. Absorption is also affected by theformulation of the agent and by host factors,such as skin thickness or gastric motility. Distribution is the process by which a drug or chemical that has reached the bloodstream istransported to peripheral tissues. Distribution isa complex process with a large number of vari-ables. Volume of distribution ( V d) is the apparent volume into which a drug distributes. It reflectsthe distribution of the drug into all of the body tis-sues. A drug that is distributed only in the plasmawill have a V dnear that of total body water (between 0.6 and 1 L/kg). Drugs that are heavilyconcentrated in the body fat will have a V dmuch greater than total body water. Elimination is the removal of a drug or chemical from the body. Elimination can occur either byexcretion or through biotransformation to one ormore metabolites. The lungs, kidneys, and liverare responsible for the majority of drug elimina-tion. Elimination is affected by integrity of organsystems, age, saturation of key enzyme processes,and the specific properties of the drug. History The primary goal of the history is to identify if apoisoning occured and which toxic agents areresponsible. This can range from a simple to extremely complex process depending on theability and willingness of the patient to answerhistorical questions and the extent to which cor-roborating information is available. Historical information should be solicited from the patient,family members, companions, friends, emergencymedical services (EMS), law enforcement, or anyother available witnesses. For the patient What drugs or pills did you take or whatchemicals were you exposed to? In a cooperative patient this may be your quick-est way to a diagnosis and plan. The question can36 Toxicologic emergencies Steven A. McLaughlin, MDToxicologic emergencies 532 Primary Complaintsbe phrased to reflect what you know about the patient's history. For example, you could ask:What pills did you take? What did the pills looklike? What chemicals were you working with atyour job? What drugs were you injecting? Thecore of this question is to get the patient's bestdescription of what agent(s) he or she was exposedto in whatever context is appropriate. Recognizethat poisoned patients may not be reliable histo-rians either from altered level of consciousness ordue to suicidiality, and additional history shouldbe obtained from other sources. What time did the ingestion occur? Timing of exposure is critical in order to determine expected signs and symptoms based on the natu- ral history of the exposure. It also helps guidetherapy such as gastric decontamination. Foragents that can be measured in the blood, such asAPAP , time of ingestion is essential to interpretdrug levels. The patient's response can be cor-roborated by family, friends, time last seen well, or other sources. How and why did the exposure occur? Patients may come into contact with toxic agents for a variety of reasons. The exposure may be a sui-cide attempt or gesture, a medication error, or an accidental, work-related, or environmental expo-sure. Understanding the reason for the exposuremay significantly influence your plan of manage-ment, the classic example being the need for psy-chiatric evaluation of the suicidal patient. What symptoms have you had since the exposure? Initially, open-ended questions can be used tofind out the patient's symptoms, which can befollowed up with specific questions looking forclinical features of the likely exposures. In manycases, treatment of an exposure is based on theseverity of the patients' symptoms. For the family, friends, emergency medical services, and law enforcement What drugs, pills, or chemicals did the patient ingest or was the patient exposedto? What time did the ingestion occur? Howand why did the exposure occur? These questions should always be asked to fam- ily, friends, EMS, or other witnesses to confirmthe patient's history and to provide additionaldetails or a different perspective. In patients withan altered level of consciousness, history ofseizure, or concern about suicidiality, this addi-tional history is extremely important. What other medications, agents, drugs, chemicals were noted at the scene? Did you bring in any pill bottles or containers? In the situation where the type of exposure, quan- tity of drug or other details are missing, havingEMS or law enforcement bring pill bottles, chem-ical containers, material safety data sheets (MSDS),or other objects from the scene can be very help-ful in providing needed information. What other pills, drugs, agents, or herbals does the patient have access to in the home,from family members, friends, etc.? Acomplete list of agents that the patient takes or has access to is invaluable in narrowing your differential and interpreting diagnostic tests.Frequently, patients may provide inaccurateinformation regarding the types of medicationsor doses, and a list of possible agents allows theprovider to look for signs/symptoms and labo-ratory findings that do not fit with the patient'sreported exposure. Certain drugs such as lithium or digoxin, if available to the patient, mayprompt additional laboratory testing. What did the home or scene look like? In addition, a description of the scene may pro- vide clues to the cause of exposure, the patient'sstate of mind or symptoms prior to the exposure. How has the patient's condition changed over time? What signs or symptoms have you noticed since the exposure? These two questions again provide a picture ofthe patient's clinical course since ingestion, whichmay help with diagnosis, triage, and assessmentof the severity of exposure. They may also indi-cate possible required interventions. Additional sources of information include the patient's pharmacy, workplace for MSDS, andregional PCCs. Key items from the previous medical history include prior exposures, psychi-atric illnesses, prior suicide attempts, social his-tory including drugs of abuse, occupationalhistory, general medical problems, and allergies.Primary Complaints 533Toxicologic emergenciesQuestions related to dosing, signs and symptoms, or other features of the patient's clinical coursemay be indicated in certain overdose situationsand should be discussed with your regional PCC. Physical examination The physical examination may provide valuableclues to the diagnosis as well as severity of symp-toms. The examination initially focuses on keyareas for supportive care: the airway, breathing,and circulation (ABCs). Repeated examination ofthe ABCs and neurologic status is essential to iden-tify early changes and anticipate increasing toxicity. General appearance The poisoned patient should be examined forevidence of trauma, general level of conscious-ness, and ability to maintain adequate airwayand breathing. Odors can also provide valuableclues to possible exposures. Some classic exam-ples of odors that may be found in poisonedpatients include: bitter almonds with cyanide,fruity smell of ketoacidosis from cause, gar-lic from organophosphates, and rotten eggs fromhydrogen sulfide. Vital signs Vital signs are critical to establish the severity and stability of the poisoning at any point in time.In addition, specific constellations of vital signscan provide clues to the diagnosis (Table 36.1). Eyes The size of the pupils can provide additionaldiagnostic clues in the poisoned patient. Miosis(small pupils) can be caused by opioids,organophosphates, clonidine, phenothiazines,and sedatives. Mydriasis (large cocaine, manyhallucinogens and anticholinergics. Horizontalnystagmus can Phencyclidine which is not typicallyseen with other ingestions. Cardiovascular Examination of the heart should be performed tosearch for bradycardia from cardiotoxic overdoseor tachycardia from a variety of exposures. Anew murmur in a patient with a history of intra- venous (IV) drug use may represent endocardi- tis. Abnormal rhythms found on examinationshould be further defined with a 12-lead electro-cardiogram (ECG). The peripheral pulses andskin should be signs of capillary refill, orweak or absent distal pulses. Pulmonary The respiratory system should be examinedthrough inspection of respiratory rate, depth, andeffort. Auscultation of the lung fields should beperformed to assess for symmetry and abnormalsounds. Drugs such as opioids, tricyclic anti-depressants (TCAs), and cholinergic agents may produce pulmonary edema that can be heard witha careful pulmonary examination. Wheezing orrales may also be heard in patients following aspi-ration of hydrocarbons or exposure to irritant toxicgases. Toxic agents producing a metabolic acidosiswill cause a compensatory increase in respiratoryrate and depth, which can be seen on examination. Table 36.1 Important toxicologic causes of abnormal vital signs Bradycardia/hypotension Beta blockers, calcium examination looking for focal findings of the cranial nerves or extremities is extremely important to rule out structural braininjury in any patient with altered mental status.Toxicologic causes of altered mental status less frequently cause focal neurologic deficits. Otherimportant findings include muscle rigidity (sero-tonin syndrome, neuroleptic malignant syndromeor strychnine), tremors (lithium, sympathomimet-ics and sedative withdrawal), and fasciculations(organophosphate poisoning). Skin Acareful skin examination can provide impor- tant diagnostic information. Survey the entireskin surface looking for needle track marks, nailchanges with heavy metal poisoning, spider orsnake bites, trauma, or paint residue from \"huff-ing.\" The oral cavity can provide clues if residualpill fragments, odors, burns from caustic expo-sures, or bite marks from seizure activity areidentified. Very dry skin is seen with anticholin-ergic poisoning, while diaphoretic skin is seenwith sympathomimetics, organophosphates, andsalicylates. Abdomen Athorough abdominal examination is important to look for other diagnoses in your differential andcomplications of caustic ingestions. In the poi-soned patient, hyperactive bowel sounds can beheard with organophosphate poisoning. Dimin-ished bowel sounds can help make the diagnosisof anticholinergic poisoning.Pelvic, genital and rectal If there is any suspicion of a foreign body or drugpackets, a rectal and pelvic examination shouldbe performed to search for these potentially dan-gerous objects. Differential diagnosis The correct diagnosis of a patient with a toxicexposure is most often found in the history usingdirected questions and alternative sources. Whenthe history does not provide a diagnosis, look atthe patients' signs and symptoms to identify thepossible exposure. Classic constellations of signsand symptoms linked with particular poisoningsare called toxidromes . These can be very helpful in single overdoses with a classic clinical picture. Incases with multiple exposures or with complica-tions related to timing, or underlying illness, clas-sic toxidromes may be of limited value. Four common toxidromes are from cholinergic, anti-cholinergic, sympathomimetic, and opioid agents (Table 36.2). A common mnemonic for choliner-gic poisoning which helps with recollection of thetoxidrome is SLUDGE: Salivation, Lacrimation,Urination, Defecation, Gastric Emptying. In otherwords, patients are \"leaky.\" For anticholinergicexposures, ANTI-SLUDGE can be used (the oppo-site of choliner gic symptoms), but the mnemonic \"blind as a bat, mad as a hatter, hot as a hare,looney as a toon, red as a beet, and dry as a bone\"has been used by many. Other less common tox-idromes exist. Important poisonings to recognizewhich have identifiable sali- TCAs, digoxin, lithium, and hypoglycemic agents. Toxicologic emergencies 534 Primary ComplaintsTable 36.2 Common retention Sympathomimetic Mydriasis Diaphoresis Tachycardia Complaints 535Toxicologic emergenciesDiagnostic testing Although laboratory testing can be helpful in diagnosing, defining and treating acute toxic expo-sures,the most important therapeutic decisions are those regarding airway management, circula-tory support, and decontamination, which donot depend on ancillary testing. Treatment ofcritically-ill patients should proceed based on theclinician's best judgment, and should not bedelayed while awaiting the results of ancillarytesting. Electrocardiogram The ECG may be helpful in both diagnosis andprediction of toxicity in acute overdose. A 12-lead ECG is suggested in any cardiotoxic over-dose including digoxin, other antidysrhythmics,phenothiazines, beta blockers, calcium channelblockers, cocaine and other sympathomimetics,and TCAs. It can be helpful in an unknown over-dose to look for cardiotoxic agents. TCAs have characteristic ECG changes that help with diagnosis and as well as suggest anincreased risk of complications. In TCA overdose,the ECG commonly shows a sinus tachycardiafrom anticholinergic effects, which alone does notpredict serious toxicity. ECG findings of a QRSinterval of more than 100 milliseconds or a largeterminal R wave in aVR in a TCA-poisoned patientpredict an increased risk of both seizures and ven-tricular tachycardia (Figures 36.1 and 36.2). Radiologic studies There are no routine radiologic studies forpatients with toxic ingestions or exposures. AKUB (kidneys, ureters, bladder) film can be help-ful in visualizing radio-opaque drugs, drug pack-ets, and other foreign bodies. \"Body stuffers\"ingest single packets of drugs to avoid detection;these are rarely seen on plain radiographs. \"Bodypackers\" ingest large numbers of well-wrappeddrug packets as a technique to transport drugswithout detection; these large numbers of packetsare usually seen on a KUB. Other agents can beseen occasionally depending on quantity, concen-tration, and time of ingestion. These potentiallyvisible agents can be remembered by themnemonic \"CHIPES\" (Table 36.3). A KUB can behelpful in iron ingestions both for initial detectionof the ingestion as well as following the progressof gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination. Chestradiographs are indicated in patients with poten-tial aspiration of hydrocarbons or other agentsthat can Electrocardiogram of tricyclic antidepressant poisoned patient showing tachycardia, a widened QRS, a rightward QRSaxis and a large terminal R wave in aVR.

The electrolytes, bloodurea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose canbe used to search for metabolic acidosis, renalinsufficiency, and significant sodium or potas-sium abnormalities. All of these potentially impactthe management of a poisoned patient. In a patientwith a metabolic acidosis, the electrolytes can beused to calculate the anion gap and help to nar-row the differential diagnosis. Anion gap /H11005Na/H11002(Cl/H11001bicarbonate) Normal range is 8-12 meq/L. The differential diagnosis of an anion gap metabolic acidosis can be remembered using themnemonic \"MUDPILECATS\" (Table 36.4). The calculated osmolal gap can narrow the differential diagnosis even further in a patientwith a metabolic acidosis. An elevated osmolalgap glycol, mannitol, or isopropanol. Theutility of this test is limited by the fact that it doesnot reveal the specific cause of the increased gap,and a normal osmolal gap does NOT rule outpoisoning with any of these agents.

It may be described by patients as \"aspirin\"or \"pain killers.\" In addition, APAP toxicity is initially clinically silent; treatment must bestarted before the patient manifests signs ofhepatic toxicity (Figure 36.3). Therefore, meas-urement of serum APAP levels is indicated inany suspected overdose or unknown exposure. Controversy exists regarding the use of routine salicylate levels in overdose patients. Salicylatetoxicity typically produces recognizable signs andsymptoms in serious overdose, including tachyp-nea, tinnitus, and diaphoresis, so screening levelsmay not routinely be indicated. However, becausethis is a common, potentially life-threateningingestion, with subtle early signs of toxicity, rou- tine salicylate levels may be appropriate in some situations. Quantitative levels of specific drugs such as carbamazapine, lithium, phenobarbitol, carbonmonoxide, and digoxin are indicated in patientswhen there is a clinical suspicion of exposurebased on the history or physical. They should notbe ordered routinely as screening tests. Qualitative urine drug screens, often referred to as \"tox screens,\" generally test the urine forthe presence of multiple drugs or their metabo-lites. These tests most commonly identify amphetamines, barbiturates, test with \"thera-peutic\" levels or with significant ingestions. Theamount of drug present cannot be inferred fromthe result of the test. Qualitative drug scr eens are only useful for identifying the presence or absenceof this limited group of drugs. In several studies,these tests have been shown to have limitedimpact on the management plan in an unknownoverdose and are not routinely recommended inoverdose patients. Recognizing these limitations,drug screens can be used to determine whichdrugs a patient has been exposed to recently, andmay be helpful in creating an accurate differentialdiagnosis or in arranging for appropriate psychi-atric follow-up or substance abuse counseling. General treatment principles There are four main components of treatment for the poisoned patient: supportive care, anti-dotes, gastric (and other) decontamination, andenhanced elimination. These can be rememberedusing the mnemonic \"SAGE\": Supportive care The majority of patients with toxic exposures willsurvive with supportive care, which includes air-way management, supplemental oxygen andventilation, and normalization of blood pressureusing IV crystalloid fluids and inotropes or vaso-pressor agents (if necessary). Every overdosepatient should be monitored initially with contin-uous cardiac, non-invasive blood pressure andpulse oximetry monitoring. IV access should beestablished in all patients.

EEnhanced includes dialysis, urinaryexcretion, signs or potentially serious ingestions require two large-bore IVs. Patients can deteriorate rap-idly, especially in cases of TCA overdose, andearly airway management with rapid sequenceintubation as needed can be lifesaving. During the initial evaluation of any patient with altered mental status, consideration shouldbe given to using the \"coma cocktail.\" The comacocktail typically consists of naloxone to reverseopioid toxicity, a fingerstick glucose and supple-mental dextrose if hypoglycemia is found, andthiamine to prevent or treat Wernicke'sencephalopathy. In patients with a reversibleoverdose such as opioid intoxication fromheroin, the patient should be oxygenated andventilated with a bag-valve-mask device untilnaloxone can be administered and take effect. Naloxone is a specific opioid antagonist which lasts 60-90 minutes. When given IV , intramuscu-lar (IM), subcutaneous (SQ), intranasally, by neb-ulizer or via an endotracheal tube, it will result ina rapid return to consciousness and spontaneousventilation in the opioid-poisoned patient. Theinitial dose of naloxone ranges from 0.1 mg for achronic opioid abuser to 0.4 mg for the generalacute overdose. Naloxone should be titrated toadequate spontaneous ventilation and mentalstatus alert enough to provide a medical history.The dose may be increased up to 2-10 mg inpatients who fail to respond to the initial dose ifthe clinical suspicion of opioid intoxicationremains high. The only significant side effect from naloxone in adults is acute opioid withdrawal,which is non-life threatening but may cause dis-comfort for the patient. There are no good data to support the use of thiamine in all patients with altered mental sta-tus, and it does not need to be given before glu-cose. Treatment of hypoglycemia takes priority.Risk factors for thiamine deficiency include mal-nutrition, alcoholism, extreme diets, or a historyof a previous deficiency. Such patients should begiven thiamine during the first 12 hours or imme-diately if they have altered mental status. The usual adult dose of thiamine is 100 mg IV or IM. Flumazenil, which is a reversal agent for ben- zodiazepines, is not part of this \"cocktail.\"Flumazenil can cause seizures in patients withsome ingestions, including TCAs, cocaine, andsympathomimetics, and can cause acute with-drawal in patients who are tolerant to benzodi-azepines. In addition, benzodiazepine overdosecan be safely managed with supportive care.Therefore, flumazenil is not recommended aspart of the coma cocktail.Antidotes Antidotes are an exciting part of toxicology,despite being of limited utility in most cases. It isimportant to be aware of the toxins that may needantidote therapy so that appropriate considerationcan be given to this treatment modality. A list ofimportant toxins and their antidotes is provided(Table 36.5). Gastric and other decontamination Decontamination of the GI system after an oralexposure, or the skin and eyes after a dermal expo-sureis critical to reduce the amount of absorbed drug and reduce potential toxicity. Appropriateprotective gear should be used when indicated inorder to protect health care providers from possi-ble exposure. Skin decontamination begins with the removal of all of the patient's clothing. Any dry powder ordebris can be brushed off. The skin is then washedwith warm soapy water until no evidence of Toxicologic emergencies Primary ComplaintsToxic substance Antidote Carbon Hyperbaric substances and antidotescontamination remains. In an ocular exposure, the eyes should be irrigated with generousamounts of normal saline until symptoms arerelieved and pH returns to normal (in the case of an acid or alkali exposure.) There are four basic techniques for decontam- ination of the GI system: induced emesis usingsyrup of ipecac, gastric lavage, activated char-coal, and whole bowel irrigation. A significantamount of ingested toxic material may remain inthe GI tract even with optimal application ofthese techniques. Given the limited effectivenessof gastric decontamination, the trend in recentyears has been to use safer and less invasive techniques. Syrup of ipecac induces vomiting through local irritation of the stomach and activation of thechemotactic trigger zone in the central nervoussystem. Ninety percent of patients begin to vomitwithin 30 minutes, and symptoms usuallyresolve by 2 hours. Due to a lack of evidence to support its effectiveness, and the potential risk ofaspiration from persistent vomiting in a seizingor comatose patient, syrup of ipecac is no longerrecommended for use in health care facilities. There may be a limited role for home-use of thisagent with very specific ingestions and guidancefrom a PCC. Gastric lavage involves placing a large plastic tube (36-40 French in adults) through the mouthinto the stomach. The stomach is emptied andlavaged with warm normal saline until thelavage effluent is clear. Activated charcoal is thenplaced down the tube into the stomach and thelavage tube is removed. Significant risks fromthis procedure include aspiration, esophagealperforation, and hypoxia. It should not be per-formed following caustic or hydrocarbon inges-tion, minor ingestions, or in patients who areunable to protect their own airway. The evidencesuggesting a benefit from this procedure is lim-ited. In an optimal scenario of small pill frag-ments, ingestion within an hour, and aggressivelavage, the best mean recoveries have been from36% to 50% of ingested material. Balancing thesesignificant risks with minimal benefits, this pro-cedure is usually recommended in patients whopresent within 1 hour of life-threatening inges-tions and have had their airway protected byendotracheal intubation. Even in highly selectedpatients, there is no evidence that it improvesoutcomes. Activated charcoal has become the mainstay of GI decontamination in recent years. It is a highlyeffective treatment for a variety of ingestions andhas a very good safety profile. Activated charcoalworks by adsorbing the toxin, thereby making itless available for absorption from the gut into thebloodstream. It is most effective if given withinone hour of ingestion, although its use is suggestedin patients presenting up to 12-24 hours fromingestion if they continue to be symptomatic orhave potentially delayed absorption fromdecreased intestinal motility, delayed-releaseproducts, or concretions. It is typically given in adose of 1 g/kg, although larger doses are occa-sionally indicated. Patients can drink the activatedcharcoal through a straw, or it can be given vianasogastric (NG) or lavage tube. The first dose ofcharcoal is often given with sorbitol or magne-sium citrate as a cathartic to reduce GI transittime. Multiple doses of activated charcoal areindicated for certain ingestions and may be donein consultation with a PCC. Contraindications toactivated charcoal are an inability to protect theairway, ingestion of a caustic agent, hydrocarbons,or other agent not bound to charcoal, or plannedendoscopy. Whole bowel irrigation (WBI) involves placing an NG tube or having the patient drink a bal-anced solution of polyethylene glycol and elec-trolytes at a rate of 1-2 L/hour. The goal is tomechanically flush out the GI tract, reducing theabsorption of certain ingested agents. Treatmentshould be continued until the patient has clearrectal effluent and no further evidence of pro- gressive toxicity. It can cause vomiting, diarrhea,and abdominal pain and it should not be used inpatients with intestinal obstruction or absentbowel sounds. WBI may be beneficial for decon-tamination in selected cases of drug bezoars, ironingestions, sustained-release preparations ofdrugs such as calcium channel blockers, andingested drug packets. Enhanced elimination There are two primary methods of enhancing theelimination of a toxin from the body: urinaryalkalinization and hemodialysis. These tech-niques are useful only for a limited number ofsubstances, and should be guided by advicefrom a PCC. Urinary alkalinization works by \"trapping\" agents that are weak acids in the renal tubulesand increasing their excretion in the urine. Theurine can be alkalinized by administration1meq/liters of IV sodium bicarbonate. The patient is given a bolus of sodium bicarbonateand then a drip (prepared with three ampules of Primary Complaints 539Toxicologic emergenciessodium bicarbonate added to 1 L of D5W with 40 meq of KCl) is infused at 150-200 ml/hour.The goal is a urine pH of 7.5-8.0. A normal serumpH should be maintained during this process.The administration of adequate potassium isessential to prevent paradoxical ofsalicylates, chlorpropamide, and phenobarbital. Hemodialysis is effective at removing small, water soluble substances with low protein bind-ing and small V d. Commonly dialyzable toxins include salicylates, theophylline, barbiturates,lithium, methanol, isopropanol, and ethyleneglycol. This invasive procedure requires place-ment of a large central venous access device.Hemodialysis can be life-saving in a number ofthese overdoses, and should be considered withthe guidance of a PCC and a consulting nephrol-ogist. The role of newer continuous arterial orvenous filtration techniques in the treatment oftoxic exposures has not been clearly defined. Special patients Pediatric The approach to pediatric poisonings is verysimilar to that in adults. Children make up a sig-nificant proportion of toxic exposures in the US.In general, supportive care and gastric deconta-mination with activated charcoal will be criticalfactors in treatment. Small doses (a single pill ortaste) of TCAs, cardiotoxic agents, Lomotil \u00ae, oral hypoglycemics, methylsalicylate, camphor,Visine \u00ae, and methanol can be fatal in children. Children with serious or potentially seriousingestions should be managed in a pediatric inten-sive care unit (PICU) setting. For accidental expo-sures, educate the parents or caregivers to preventfuture incidents. Cases of suspected abuse or neg-lect should trigger mandatory referral to child pro-tective services or police authorities. Elderly Geriatric patients are at high risk for complicationsof toxic exposure due to underlying cardiovascu-lar, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, and other systemicdiseases. Patients on large numbers of medica-tions are also at risk for adverse reactions fromdosing errors, wrong medications or medicationinteractions. Medication complications such aschronic salicylism should be considered in geri-atric patients presenting with hypotension, brady-cardia, altered mental status, weakness, nausea orvomiting, and acidosis. Depression is also com-mon in elderly patients, and appropriate screen-ing should occur if there is a suspicion of anintentional overdose. Immune compromised Patients with human immunodeficiency virus(HIV), acquired immune deficiency syndrome(AIDS), or malignancy may be on a large numberof toxic medications and should be carefullyscreened for medication-related causes of anypresenting complaint. The patient's primary careprovider or specialist as well as the PCC can pro-vide guidance on the clinical presentation andtreatment of toxicity from any unusual medica-tions. An appropriate psychiatric history shouldbe taken to look for signs or symptoms of depres-sion and suicidal ideation. Pregnancy In general, appropriate treatment of the motherfor her overdoses will also benefit the fetus. Life-saving therapy should not be withheld from themother because of concerns for fetal toxicity.Depression is also common in this group andshould be screened for in any suspected inten-tional overdose. CO poisoning, APAP and ironingestions are good examples of serious expo-sures where the antidote given to the mother issafe and also protects the fetus from toxicity. Disposition Asymptomatic patients with potentially seriousexposures should have appropriate diagnosticstudies and be watched for at least 6 hours. Inmost cases, if they remain asymptomatic at theend of 6 hours, they can be safely discharged.Every patient with suspected suicidiality should receive an appr opriate evaluation by a mental health professional. Certain medications with delayed onset of symptoms or prolonged clinical toxicity mayrequire 12-24 hours observation in an emergency department (ED) or short-stay unit. These agentsare methadone, Lomotil \u00ae, oral hypoglycemics, lithium, sustained-release calcium channelblockers, and theophylline. In every case of toxic Toxicologic emergencies 540 Primary Complaintsexposure, be familiar with the expected time course of symptoms. Patients who have more than minor symp- toms, develop toxicity during the 6 hour obser-vation period, or who have evidence of toxicityon diagnostic testing should be admitted to theappropriate subacute care or ICU setting. PCCs are the single best source for informa- tion about diagnosis, management and dispositionof patients with toxic exposures. They can pro-vide consultation with a toxicologist, follow-upfor patients discharged home, locations of medicalcenters that may accept transfers of patients withspecial therapeutic needs, and assist with moni-toring of hospitalized patients. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Poisoning is common in the US. The mostcommon serious exposures are fromanalgesics, antidepressants, cardiovasculardrugs, CO, and drugs of abuse. History from the patient may not be reliableand should be confirmed through differentsources if possible. The physical examination may occasionallylead to a diagnosis through classic signs andsymptoms of common poisonings calledtoxidromes. A fingerstick glucose and oxygen saturation should be checked in every patient withaltered mental status, and considerationshould be given to the immediateadministration of naloxone and thiamine. Antidotes, although occasionally helpful, aresecondary to general supportive care in themanagement of most toxic exposures. Gastric lavage is rarely performed, except onintubated and critically-ill patients. There isessentially no role for syrup of ipecac in ahospital setting. The mainstay of gastricdecontamination is activated charcoal. Pediatric patients are at high risk for accidentalexposures and may have serious effects ordeath even from small doses or single tabletsof certain medications and chemicals. Geriatric and immunocompromised patientsare at high risk for drug toxicity from dosingerrors, wrong medications, or medicationinteractions. Intentional ingestions should beconsidered in these groups. Asymptomatic patients should be watched inthe ED for at least 6 hours. Patients withexposures to long-acting agents or agentswith a delayed onset of action may need12-24 hours observation. The PCC is the best source of information ondiagnosis and management of toxicexposures and should be consulted onessentially every case that presents to ahealth care facility.

Toxicologic emergencies 542 Primary ComplaintsPrimary Complaints 543Urinary-related complaints Scope of the problem Urinary-related complaints are found in many patients presenting to the emergency depart-ment (ED). The wide variety of complaints canbe staggering, overshadowed only by their costto the health care system. Careful evaluation mayuncover undiagnosed congenital abnormalitiesthreatening future renal function, serious infec-tions, or disease complications. Identification ofurosepsis allows prompt treatment to prevent sub-sequent morbidity and mortality. This chapter focuses on dysuria, hematuria, nephrolithiasis, urinary tract infection (UTI), andacute urinary retention. These categories aloneaccount for billions of health care dollars, and several million ED visits annually. As such, it isimportant for practitioners to have knowledge of anatomy, evaluation, and treatment. Anatomic essentials Urologic anatomy is essentially identical fromrenal unit to bladder in both sexes (Figure 37.1). It differs from bladder to meatus in obvious ways.The renal unit and the gonads have a similarembryologic origin, so pain in one location is often referred to the other. The kidneys them- selves are retroperitoneal organs, relatively pro-tected by the inferior ribs posteriorly.After formation of urine in the glomerular unit, urine travels into the renal calyces which merge toformthe renal pelvis. This renal pelvis cones down to form the ureter. The ureter travels caud-ally and arises out of the posterior pelvic brim as it crosses over the iliac vessels, then inserts into thebladder itself through a small narrowed intra-mural portion. It is in these anatomic points of narrowing that calculi of the renal system can potentially lodge. A significant percentage ofcases of ureteral obstruction cause pain from dis-tention and dilation of the upper ureter and renalpelvis (hydronephrosis). Normal micturition is a very complicated neuromotor process, with a micturition controlcenter located in the spinal cord at the S2-S4level. Autonomic control of various musclegroups allows for coordinated voiding via a bal-ance between parasympathetic and sympatheticinnervation. Any interruption of this sacral reflexarc from a lower motor neuron lesion will lead toloss of sensation of bladder fullness, resulting inan atonic bladder that fails to empty. This mayoccur via traumatic mechanisms, as in lumbarvertebral fractures or disc herniation, or fromatraumatic mechanisms, such as epidural abscess or tumor metastasis. Unfortunately, up to 5-10%of carcinomas (especially cancers of the breast,lung, prostate, and kidney) show predilection forepidural metastasis. Upper motor neuron lesions37 Urinary-related complaints Fred MD Kidney Renal pelvis Ureter Urinary bladder Figure 37.1 Female urinary anatomy view view. Sigmoid colon tube OvaryUrinary-related Primary Complaintsabove T11 may result in a spastic bladder that fails to allow for adequate urine storage. Normal urinary flow through the bladder with its subsequent bladder washout is the primaryhost defense mechanism against infection.Bacteria from the perineum can migrate up theurethra. Hence, the shorter female urethra predis-poses females to more frequent UTIs, especially ininfants, children, and sexually-active women.Predominance shifts towards males as they getolder, when incomplete emptying of the bladderdue to prostatic enlargement becomes a problem.Some authors comment upon a \"milking\" actionwhich occurs to the female urethra during sexualintercourse. This has led to the observation thatprompt voiding following intercourse lessens thefrequency of UTI. Certain bacteria, however, haveevolved very efficient mechanisms over time toattach to bladder's epithelial and mucosal sur-faces, bypassing normal washout defense mecha-nisms. From bladder to meatus, the anatomy differs greatly between genders. The female anatomyincludes a short urethral distance to the actualmeatus. However, the nearby vagina, cervix,uterus, and parametrial structures complicatedisease processes as well as evaluation. The male urethra exits the bladder and is enveloped by the prostate gland (Figure 37.2).The male urethra is longer anatomically than thefemale urethra, and as such is more prone tostrictures over its caliber and length. These mayoccur as a result of prior instrumentation(indwelling foley catheter), trauma, or as a seque-lae of urethritis. The striated muscle in the uro-genital diaphragm that is distal to the prostateitself Benign or hyperplasia is age; autopsy studies show thatupwards of 50-60% of men over 50 years of agehave some element of BPH. History The history in the patient with urinary com-plaints is extremely important, as there are gen-erally no specific external findings associatedwith the common causes of urinary complaints.Acareful history also helps identify clues that can be used to guide clinical investigation. Oneneeds to determine if the ailment involves theurinary or reproductive tract, and investigateaccordingly. How did your symptoms begin? It is typically a sudden change in normal voiding pattern that brings the patient to see a physician.The time course, time of day that symptomsoccur, and alleviating or irritating factors shouldbe ascertained. Sudden onset of pain is often Urinary bladder Vas deferens Prostate complaintscharacteristic of acute obstruction. Progressive symptoms such as dribbling and increased noc-turia frequently accompany slow enlargement ofthe prostate (BPH) that tends to develop overtime. Can you describe the pain? Many urologic presentations have some compon- ent of associated pain. This may be irritative painduring micturition, lower abdominal pain in thesuprapubic region or perineum associated withthe bladder or prostate, or flank pain associatedwith ureteral or renal disease. Renal colic is typ-ically abrupt in onset, although some irritative symptoms may be noted preceding the abrupt onset of colic. It may radiate towards the groin,testicles, or ovaries. Are you unable to spontaneously void? Inability to void is typically an acute presenta- tion, and the patient presents with an urgentneed for relief. It is key to inquire about obstruc-tive symptoms, such as slowly worsening hesi-tancy, decrease in stream force or caliber, andpost-void dribbling. These clue the examiner to aslowly progressive obstruction with an acuteendpoint, as opposed to an acute process with adifferent etiology. With acute presentations, thinkof infection, clot retention, medication, or toxico-logic causes. Is your urinary elimination normal? Micturition-associated fullness,incontinence, and suprapubic pain. Carefulquestioning of the patient as to when the symp-toms occur may help localize the inflammatoryprocess. Do the symptoms predominate beforevoiding, at the initiation of the voiding stream,during the mid-stream phase, or after the void-ing act itself? This line of questioning can helpdifferentiate bladder from urethral symptoms.The presence of gas bubbles in association withthe urinary stream can help identify an abnormalcommuni cation between the gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) tracts, often associated with colonic diverticula (colovesicle fistula). Is the urine discolored? Not all discolored urine is secondary to hema- turia. Gross hematuria and clot formation areeasily identified, urinemay be from blood, abnormal chromagens suchas bile, nutritional sources, and dyes themselves.Cloudy urine usually occurs from protein orcrystals, not from cells. One should also askabout the timing of the hematuria in relation tothe urinary stream. Bleeding from the anteriorurethra to the trigone, or the bladder and proxi-mal structures, can present with initial, terminal,or total stream hematuria, respectively. Are you having other abnormal symptoms associated with either elimination or theperineum? Abnormalities of the micturition reflex arc tend to have other neurologic manifestations, such asbowel dysfunction with either incontinence orretention. The patient may also complain of anes- thesia in a saddle distribution, if specificallyasked. A sexual history can be very helpful, forthe same autonomic innervation is important forboth male and female sexual function. Abnormalpain, anesthesia, or inability to achieve an erec-tion (impotence) may help identify neurologicpathology. Have you had any genitourinary problems in the past? Many urologic conditions are chronic in nature, and the patient may be able to relate symptomsto prior disease presentations. A history of kid-ney stones, urologic malignancies, prior surgicalinstrumentation of the urinary tract, and priorinfections can help clinicians narrow down thedifferential diagnosis. Abrupt flank pain in theelderly hypertensive patient without a history ofstone disease could be related to nephrolithiasis,but acute aortic disease must have higher diag-nostic consideration. Prior instrumentation ofthe urethra from indwelling foley catheters maylead to urethral strictures. A careful sexual historycan also identify risk factors for sexually transmit-ted infections (STIs), such as a history of abnormaldischarge, genital pain or lesions, or unprotectedsexual activity with multiple partners. Are you taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications? Recent antibiotic use can help identify the poten-tial for antibiotic resistance if an infection is pre-sent. Many medications have anticholinergic side effects, which can cause bladder outlet obstructionand acute urinary retention. A common example is the over-the-counter antihistamine used for avariety of unrelated symptoms. Other medicationsor foods can cause urinary discoloration, and attimes burning. Associated symptoms Ahistory of fever or chills may serve as an indirect marker of infection, especially in the afebrilepatient who may have recently taken non-steroidalanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetamino-phen for pain relief. Ureterolithiasis may causeintermittent pallor, nausea, diaphoresis, and vom-iting; a relative bradycardia is not uncommon withkidney stone presentations. Flank pain with shoul-der radiation usually reflects a sub-diaphragmaticprocess such as hemorrhage or abscess. Oneshould ask about cardiopulmonary symptomssuch as cough, dyspnea, and chest pain that maycause pain referred to the flanks. Renal diseasemay stimulate the celiac ganglion that serves bothkidney and stomach, producing classic nausea andvomiting. The inability to keep down oral fluids ormedications can help with patient disposition.Diarrhea in the female patient can easily colonizethe urethra and bladder with coliform bacteria,causing UTI. Gynecologic symptoms such asmenses, vaginal discharge and/or bleeding,abnormal pelvic pain, and contraception practicescan help establish a differential diagnosis. Physical examination Afocused physical examination may help differ- entiate upper tract disease from lower tract dis-ease, but may be normal. The clinician must firstlook at the entire patient, starting with the gen-eral appearance. General appearance The general appearance of a patient with urinarycomplaints may vary from minimal to no dis-comfort to severe pain. Patients may appear pale,diaphoretic, cool, and/or clammy. They may beactively vomiting and writhing in pain, or bevery comfortable reading a magazine. Hydration status of the patient can also be quickly gleanedat this time. Renal colic tends to cause the patient to writhe about, restless on the examination table, with nei- ther relief nor exacerbation upon movement.Peritonitis, on the other hand, is classically muchworse with patient movement; most patientswith peritoneal pathology lie still to avoid exac-erbating their pain. Vital signs Vital signs are a key component of every patient encounter. Hemodynamic instability can beinferred from tachycardia, hypotension, andsigns of inadequate tissue perfusion, such asaltered mental status. An accurate temperature isessential, especially in the context of infection. Arelative bradycardia may be associated with nephrolithiasis. Cardiopulmonary Cardiopulmonary examination may identify comorbid conditions. Lower lobe pulmonary dis-ease, such as infiltrates, pleural andpulmonary infarctions can cause pain referred tothe flank. Rales, decreased breath sounds, pleuralrubs, or isolated wheezing can give the clinician clues to these diseases. Cardiac auscultation canidentify fibrillation that may predispose to theproduction of emboli. Abnormal valvular mur-murs raise suspicion for infectious endocarditis,which may result in renal infarction. Abdomen On abdominal examination, the kidneys are gen-erally not palpable. However, with polycysticdisease or significant hydronephrosis, one mayactually palpate them as deep structures in theupper abdomen. One must examine the patientfor other masses, such as a pulsatile abdominalaortic aneurysm (AAA), pregnant uterus, or distended bladder. Auscultation of abnormalabdominal bruits may suggest vascular disease. Back Here, the kidneys are relatively protected in thebony confines of the costovertebral angles. Fistpercussion may elicit flank pain, and careful fin-ger palpation separates this from midline muscu-loskeletal causes. Renovascular bruits. Perineum Examination of the external meatus may revealirritation and/or discharge. Examine the labiaand/or scrotum for additional pathology, such Urinary-related complaints 546 Primary air or cutaneous discoloration associated with of this disease allows timely surgi-cal debridement in the operating room (OR) andproper administration of intravenous (IV) antibi-otics. Lesions should be identified anywhere inor surrounding the perineum, which may be thecause of pain or suggest alternate etiologies. Rectal Acareful examination investigates not only for rec- talpathology, but also documents the integrity of the micturition reflex arc. Perianal sensation and\"normal\" sphincter tone may be subjective, but anintact bulbocavernosus reflex is objective evidencethat a complete reflex arc integrating the sensorynerves, spinal cord, and motor fibers exists. The bulbocavernosus reflex is tested by inserting afinger into the patient's rectum and then gentlytugging on an indwelling foley catheter or lightlysqueezing the glans or clitoris. Normally, thiswill induce contraction of the anal sphincter andverify integrity of spinal cord segments S2-S4. The anal wink reflex (S2-S5) is tested by scratch- ing the perianal skin which normally inducesanal sphincter contraction. Prostate The digital examination of the prostate assessesfor hypertrophy, tenderness, and masses. A nor-mal digital examination does not rule out internalurethral compression from asymmetric prostatelobe enlargement. Often one may find a loss ofthe \"normal\" median sulcus on digital examin-ation with significant prostate enlargement, andthe superior boundary of the prostate may bebeyond reach of the examining digit. Abnormalpain or \"bogginess\" is a sign of prostatic infection.One must take care not to massage a tender orboggy prostate; bacteremia may occur as a result,complicating the patient's course. Pelvic Often, the history alone in the female patient can-not differentiate between a urologic or gyneco-logic cause of symptoms. A careful speculumand bimanual examination can identify gyneco-logic etiologies such as cervicitis, ovarian patho-logy, or urinary frequency associated withpregnancy. From a practical standpoint, it alsoallows a \"quick-cath\" urine sampling during theexamination.Differential diagnosis Diagnostic testing Laboratory studies Urine collection One must obtain and study a clean sample of urine for patients with urologic complaints. Thisis often problematic during the ED visit. Longwaiting times often preclude adequate and timelysampling from patients able to produce an adequate specimen. The verbal presentation ofdiagnostic bladder catheterization to parents or patients is often met with fear. In the pediatric population, a bag specimen is generally not accepted for identification ofinfection and culture. Eighty-five percent or moreof positive urine collections obtained via bag Primary Complaints 547Urinary-related complaints Table 37.1 Differential diagnosis of urinary-related complaints Dysuria Foreign body parasites, bacteria, renal tuberculosisGlomerulonephritisMyoglobinuria (positive dipstick, negative RBCs)Neoplasia - from kidney, bladder, prostate to urethraPolycystic kidney disease Renal infarction - vascular disease, sickle cell - from ProstatitisUrethral irritation are prompting unnec- essary and potentially harmful treatment andimaging studies that follow. Females and uncir-cumsized males need adequate urine obtainedby a one-time \"in-and-out\" bladder catheteriza-tion, which has less than a 1% chance of inducinga UTI. Some literature ar gues for the usefulness of a spontaneously voided mid-stream sample in a circumsized pediatric male, but waiting with acup next to an uncomfortable patient is challeng-ing at best, and futile in practice. Adult males for the most part can provide a clean catch, mid-stream urine collection. Thismay be impossible in a debilitated patient unableto comply with instructions. Proper cleansing isimportant, as well as wasting the initial portion ofurine into the toilet before collecting the sample. Urine collection in the sexually-active adult female relies on the absence of vaginal dischargewhich can contaminate the urinary stream.History may or may not be accurate, making apelvic examination important (especially in theadolescent female). If there are no gynecologiccomplaints or discharge, a correctly obtainedclean-catch urine sampling should suffice. Havethe patient sit backwards on the toilet, cleanse theexternal genitalia, void a small amount into the toi-let,and then collect a sample into the cup. Urinalysis Once an adequate urine sample is obtained, debate between dipstick testing versus formal laboratoryurinalysis (UA) occurs. Time of testing, cost, and local practice trends all contribute to the wide-spread variation between the actual test used.Urine dipstick testing (a 30 cent test that takes afew minutes to perform at the bedside) has ahigh positive predictive value, but is not withoutlimitations. Up to 5% of patients with normaldipsticks have abnormal microscopy. Leukocyteesterase will pick up white blood cells (WBCs)associated with infection, but will also identify WBCs associated with any inflammation. Nitrite examination has a high positive predictive value(96%) for UTI, but a low negative predictivevalue. Nitrate is converted to nitrite via bacterialmetabolism; however, bladder incubation is aprerequis ite. Nitrite testing is best per formed on the first void of the day , after overnight incuba- tion in the bladder has allowed for nitrite pr oduc- tion. Bacterial counts will double every hour atroom temperature, and double more quickly at body temperature. Once obtained, perform adipstick analys is promptly or send the urine tothe laboratory. The lab typically takes over an hourto process the specimen and provide results.Delayed evaluation of a urine specimen (e.g., urineobtained from the patient in the waiting room andleft sitting for hours before actually going to thelaboratory) may lead to falsely-positive results. The dipstick method for blood will look for hemoglobin-like compounds. It does not differ-entiate between hemoglobin from red blood cells(RBCs) and myoglobin from skeletal musclebreakdown. Positive dipsticks should have con-firmatory microscopy to quantitate the degree ofhematuria. There is no correlation between redcells on microscopy and the degree of obstructionseen with renal calculi. Occasionally, one mayhave complete obstruction of the ureteter withoutRBCs on initial UA. Subsequent follow-up UAsmay reveal hematuria. Urinary pH is obtained via dipstick, and helps differentiate infections from intrinsic metabolicconditions. Alkaline urine (pH /H110227.5) typically results from urea-splitting bacterial infections such as those caused by Proteus or Pseudomonas . Acidic urine (pH /H110215.5) effectively rules out renal tubu- lar acidosis (RTA) as a cause for nephrolithiasis. If the preliminary testing is suggestive of UTI, the next question is: does the patient need a urineculture? Multiple studies have shown the inef-fectiveness and wasted expense of urine cultures in the management of simple, uncomplicatedpatients. High-risk groups mandating cultureinclude immunocompromised, age extremes,pregnant, obstructed, and treatment failures. Additional studies If a pelvic examination has been performed, stand- ard practice is to send off cultures looking for STIssuch as gonorrhea and chlamydia. The actual testvaries with institution, but often uncovers silentSTIs. The female patient of childbearing ageshould also have a pregnancy test performed. Gross hematuria may also prompt hemato- logic testing. A baseline hematocrit can identifyanemia and help with follow-up care, but is oftenunnecessary with simple hematuria. Historicalquestions such as prior bleeding problems oreasy bruising can usually uncover bleeding ten-dencies, as in inherited coagulation disorders.Laboratory investigation of coagulation profilesmay be helpful in the patient currently treatedwith coumadin, but there is no indication for rou- tine testing in the patient with hematuria. An International Normalized Ratio (INR) may beindicated to uncover drug int eractions between Urinary-related complaints 548 Primary Complaintsoral anticoagulants and antibiotics (such as sulfon- amides or quinolones) that prolong the INR, evenif there has not been a change to a patient's anti-coagulation dose. Routine investigation of renal function via crea- tinine levels promotes controversy. Older forms ofurologic imaging that utilized contrast radiogra-phy often required assessment of creatinine levelsbefore the administration of the IV contrast.Prolonged ureteral obstruction can cause irre-versible renal damage and creatinine elevation;however, not every patient with a kidney stoneneeds a baseline creatinine. Practice variations dooccur, but most urologists request a baseline creati-nine for any stone greater than 5 mm in size, asthese stones may not pass spontaneously. Radiologic studies Radiologic imaging for urinary complaints isutilized for complicated infections, anatomicabnormalities, or obstruction. Options includeultrasound, plain films, intravenous pyelograms(IVPs) and computerized tomography (CT). US is very useful in delineating bladder dis- tention, and a carefully performed study oftencan show fluid-fluid interfaces between urineand retained clot. Renal ultrasound may showhydronephrosis from obstruction, but the degreeof hydronephrosis depends upon many factorswhich may lead to inconsistencies in interpreta-tion. Shadowing may occasionally be seen fromrenal parenchymal stones, but ureteral stones are often not visualized with US. The kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) film, if prop- erly performed, can be helpful in the identificationof radiopaque structures such as ureteral or blad-der calculi. The urologist can identify stone loca-tion and follow progress towards spontaneouselimination. One may also diagnose emphysema-tous pyelonephritis from gas-forming organisms. The IVP utilizes injected contrast to image the renal unit via excretion of dye into the collecting system and transit to the bladder. This procedureplaces the patient at risk for ionic contrastmedium reactions that range from increased painfrom the contrast load to fatal anaphylaxis. If pos-itive for high-grade obstruction, a properly per-formed study requires delayed films that maytake hours. IVPs can, however, generate valuableanatomic and functional data, and are the pre-ferred test of many urologists. Anewer advance in urinary imaging, espe- cially for calculus disease, is the non-contrast CT scan. This study may reveal the obstructingcalculus as well as the degree of resultinghydronephrosis (Figure 37.3). Perhaps moreimportantly, the scan can identify an alternativeetiology for the patient's symptoms. If the CT ispositive for obstruction, the urologist may ask for aconfirmatory KUB film to identify the stone's loca-tion in two dimensions in relation to radiographicstructures, such as a transverse process or thepelvic brim. This is a more cost-effective method offollowing stone progress through the collectingsystem, when compared to a repeat CT scan or IVP . Calculous disease is often diagnosed clinically, and confirmed with radiologic imaging or even-tual stone passage. These modalities allow the cli-nician to accurately measure the size and preciseanatomic location of the obstruction. Calculi siz-ing is very important in prognosis, as /H110214-5 mm sized-stones pass spontaneously greater than 90%of the time. This rate of spontaneous passage fallsdramatically with increasing stone size; only 10%of 8 mm calculi will pass spontaneously. The time from diagnosis to actual stone pas- sage also varies with stone size and initial stonelocation, among other things. Gravel-sized cal-culi up to 2 mm typically pass in 5-8 days. Larger2-4 mm calculi often require 7-14 days for spon-taneous passage. These are rough estimations atbest, and individual time to passage varies withthe clinical situation, the stone's location, and thepatient's anatomy.

Right-sidedcalculi are more likely to pass spontaneously com-pared to left-sided calculi. The three most commonsites for ureteral obstruction include the junctionof the ureter with renal pelvis, the deflection ofthe over the iliac vessels, and the uretero-vesicle junction (UVJ), the most common site ofobstruction. General treatment principles Specific treatment of urologic disorders encoun- tered in the ED varies by etiology. It is easiest todivide these into infection treatment, obstructionrelief, and pain control. The majority of urinary tract complaints have a combination of symp-toms for clinicians to address. Infection treatment Infectious disorders need antimicrobial therapydirected against typical uropathogens. Mostcausative organisms are from colonization of theperineum, which helps direct therapy. There aremany effective drugs for the typical uropathogen,but one must balance cost, local resistance to aparticular agent, and unique patient characteris-tics, such as pregnancy and age, when choosing specific treatment. Recommended therapy for UTIs, both com- plicated and simple, is not without controversy.Advocates for all types of therapy try to balancecost of therapy with local bacterial resistance pat-terns in order to come up with specific treatmentrecommendations. Problematic to this is the fact that antimicrobial resistance is often difficult tocharacterize, because empiric therapy withouturine culture is commonplace. Some locales areshowing increasing bacterial resistance to anti-microbials. Bacterial resistance to drugs and cost recom- mendations specific to a hospital's formulary arebest handled by referring to your particular hospi-tal or region's bacterial sensitivity patterns. Someregions have abnormally high bacterial resistance to cephalosporins or sulfonamide drugs. In theseregions, quinolone therapy may be a more expen- sive yet practical choice for therapy. The potentialfor quinolone-directed osseous and cartilage dam-age prevents its use in the pediatric population.Sulfa-based medicines have worked well in thepediatric population in the past, attacking bacteriaby inhibiting folate metabolism. This class ofdrugs poses special concerns to the pregnantpatient and fetus in the first trimester, however,when folate is so important in organogenesis.Third trimester use of sulfonamides may also leadto kernicterus , to the fetus, the deposition of bili- rubin pigments in the fetal brain. For uncomplicated UTIs, a 3-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)results in a bacteriologic cure within 7 days in 94% of women (Table 37.2). Even where bacterial resist-ance rates are as high as 30%, cure rates of 80-85%in women are still possible. The concern resistancehas prompted various authors to recommend offlouroquinolones in place of TMP-SMX for thetreatment of UTIs. Fluoroquinolones are bioavail-able, often allowing for single daily dosing andhigher patient compliance. However, they areClass C agents (with regard to pregnancy) and aremore expensive. The Infectious Diseases Society ofAmerica recommends initial use of TMP-SMXexcept in areas where resistance exceeds 10-20%.Care must be exercised with some of the newerquinolone formulations on the market, for theyhave little or no renal penetration, limiting theireffectiveness against urinary pathogens. There can be simple as well as complicated UTIs. This differentiation can be difficult to make clinically, for 30-50% of women with isol-ated lower tract symptoms have subclinicalpyelonephritis. Prior treatment, microabscess for-mation, retained calculi, indwelling catheters, and urine obstruction and stasis all create compli-cated infections in otherwise immunocompetenthosts. Altered anatomy, such as progesterone-induced ureteral dilation with subsequent stasisfound in pregnant patients, warrants for a 7-14 days (Table 37.3).

Patients at age extremes not uncommonly sufferfrom transient bacteremia, making aggressivetherapy important in these patient populations. Other clinical factors for the clinician to con- sider are the patient's hydration status and his orher ability to maintain hydration following dis- charge. Failure to keep even the most powerfuland expensive antibiotic in the GI system rendersit ineffective. If hydrated, discharge instructionsfor the patient with a simple UTI often encourage \"forcing fluids\" and acidifying the urine. Forcing fluids should ensure adequate hydration, andcontributes to bladder washout. However, largevolumes of dilute urine will decrease the concen-tration of antibiotic in the urine. It is probablymore important to emphasize frequent and com-plete bladder emptying. Urine acidification,often through cranberry juice ingestion, canresult in a relative reduction of bacterial loads in infected urine. Some of this may be related tointerference with bacterial adherence to uro-epithelial cells via an unknown mechanism. If the patient has infection concomitant with ureteral obstruction, this creates a proximal renalunit abscess. Antibiotics start therapy, butprompt renal pelvis emptying via either ureteralstent or directed nephrostomy drainage will berequired in most cases. Urologic consultation is important in these complicated patients. Obstruction relief Bladder obstruction requires urinary drainage ordiversion. Any mechanical instrumentation torelieve such obstruction poses iatrogenic risks to the patient, either via transient bacteremia or cre-ation of a false urethral passage. Lubrication, topi-cal anesthetics, patience, and practice help preventiatrogenic problems. The most common approachto bladder obstruction is placement of a Foleycatheter. Another specialized urinary catheter reg-ularly used in the ED setting is the coud\u00e9 catheter,which has a relatively fixed curve to the distal fewcentimeters of the catheter. This feature allows thecatheter to deflect off an enlarged prostate lobe atthe bladder neck and pass through the prostaticurethra. Another option for urinary diversion isthe placement of a suprapubic catheter, bypassingthe prostate and urethra completely. A urologistmay also attempt to instrument the urethrathrough the use of urethral sounds, filiforms andfollowers, or fiber-optic instruments and seldingerwire passage. These techniques are beyond thescope of emergency physician practice. After satisfactory Foley catheter placement in the setting of acute urinary retention, the questionarises as to how fast to empty the bladder.Theoretical complications include intramuralhemorrhage and hematuria from rapid decom-pression, as well as potential for post-obstructivediuresis and high-output renal failure after anydrainage procedure. One must balance such theo-retical concerns (e.g., rare, usually inconsequen- tial bleeding) with genuine patient concerns suchas pain from continued r etention. If more than 800 ml of urine is obtained, it is prudent to leavethe catheter in place and r emove it at a later time. Otherwise, bladder atony will likely lead to a Primary Complaints 551Urinary-related complaints Table 37.4 Treatment of pediatric UTIs mg PO q day for 10-14 days Ciprofloxacin XR 500 mg PO q day for 10-14 days Second-line therapy TMP-SMX 160/800 PO bid for 10-14 days Amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg PO t id, 875 mg PO bid for 10-14 days Ceftriaxone-parenteral 1-2 gr ams IV q day Gentamycin-parenteral 3-5 mg/kg/day IV divided tid (accordingto renal function) Unasyn-parenteral 3 grams IV q 6 hours twice a day; IV: Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole.subsequent episode of urinary retention, as will continued obstruction secondary to prostatic enlargement. Transient hypoten sion following catheterization, perhaps related to vagal stimula-tion, has been reported in the literature. Pain control Pain management with urinary complaints isdirected at either irritative or obstructive symp-toms. Irritative symptoms may require only acet-aminophen or NSAID, and occasional use ofurinary anesthetics such as pyridium. Typically,only a few days of therapy are required for reliefof irritative symptoms. Side effects of pyridiuminclude urine discoloration and the potential for hemolysis and methemoglobinemia, especially in susceptible patients with unknown glucose-6-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency who are alsotreated with sulfonamides. Ureteral obstruction from calculi creates intermittent episodes of complete obstruction,hydronephrosis, and pain. Some clinicians useeither spasmolytic or anticholinergic drugs toreduce pain and frequency of these colicky episodes, but the medical literature has not sup-ported this practice. Newer investigations haverevealed that much of the pain is mediated by ureter-released prostaglandins in response toobstruction. These prostaglandins increase peri-stalsis, which is an attempt by the ureter to movethe stone down for spontaneous passage. NSAIDs,such as ketorolac or ibuprofen, are very effectivein relieving the pain, nausea, and vomiting asso-ciated with colic. Their use is not without caution,however, as canine models have demonstrateddecreased renal blood flow and acute, transientrenal failure. Narcotics are also effective at blunting pain in the ED. Incremental IV dosing is effective atpain reduction, and allows further titration ofmedication without the additional discomfort ofintramuscular (IM) injections. Narcotic medica-tion for a short course of therapy is usually pru-dent upon patient discharge, often in addition toa prescription for NSAIDs. Special patients Elderly The elderly patient is likely to present with comorbidity, but may also be unable to give anaccurate history to the clinician. It is not uncom-mon for UTIs to cause altered mentation, which Urinary-related complaints 552 Primary Complaintsmust be considered in the differential diagnosis for behavioral changes. The nursing home patientpresents several unique challenges; not only doesthis patient population tend to be colonized withantibiotic-resistant organisms, but indwellingcatheters predispose to bladder colonization andresultant ascending infections. A unique problem in the elderly male patient is extension of organ-isms into the prostate itself, with subsequentobstruction of prostatic drainage from anindwelling catheter. This patient needs prompturologic consultation and suprapubic urinarydiversion. Pregnant Urinary tract symptoms are relatively commonthroughout pregnancy. Conditions ranging fromasymptomatic bacteriuria to complicated uppertract disease (pyelonephritis) can have adverse effects on both mother and fetus, and are impor-tant for clinicians to consider. Hormone-inducedchanges of the renal collecting system, primarilyfrom elevated progesterone levels, lead toreduced ureteral and bladder tone and physio- logic hydroureter of pregnancy. Pregnantwomen also have increased bladder capacitywhich, combined with urinary stasis, predis-poses to bacterial overgrowth and proliferation. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a relatively com- mon entity, found in up to 9% of first trimestergestations. Untreated disease can progress topyelonephritis in 20 to 40% of patients in somestudies, with its associated risks (sepsis, pretermdelivery, and potential intrauterine fetal growthretardation) to both mother and fetus. Symp- tomatic cystitis in pregnancy deserves empirictreatment, with the additional caveat that a urineculture be sent. Up to 15% of pregnant patientswith cystitis will develop relapses during theirpregnancy, and the culture and sensitivity helpsguide follow-up therapy. Ascending upper tractinfection in the form of pyelonephritis poses sig-nificant risk to pregnant women, both from amedical as well as an obstetrical standpoint. Upto 20% of such patients have been shown todevelop severe complications, such as urosepsisor preterm delivery. Outpatient management of asymptomatic bacteriuria and uncomplicated cystitis in preg-nancy is directed at the typical uropathogens,with E. coli responsible for up to 2/3 of all cases. Cephalosporins, amoxicillin, or sulfonamide ther-apyfor a 3-day course is appropriate (Table 37.5). Use of sulfonamides in pregnant women at termor mothers nursing infants younger than 2 months of age is not advised as sulfonamides may pro-mote the displacement of bilirubin from plasmaproteins leading to kernicterus. Flouroquinolonesshould never be used in the pregnant patient due to their actions on growing cartilage.Nitrofurantoin for a seven-day course of therapy isalso an effective agent for uncomplicated disease. Pyelonephritis may complicate up to 2% of all gestations. The non-pregnant patient oftenresponds to outpatient therapy, but the pregnant patient may require admission by the obstetricalservice for IV hydration and antibiotics.Cephalosporins are typically chosen for therapy,but local resistance patterns as well as obstetricalpreferences in caring for this population shouldbe considered. It is prudent to involve the obstet-rical service in the care plan. If discharge occurs,a 10-14 day course of antibiotic therapy is typical. Pediatric Pediatric patients, like the elderly, often cannotlocalize pathology via an adequate history. Onemust consider a urinary source of infection in allfebrile infants. When obtaining urine samplesvia bladder instrumentation, it is advised to sendoff a culture to ensure proper treatment whenfollow-up is arranged. Following a single infec-tion in a high-risk pediatric patient, manyauthors recommend outpatient urologic imagingto identify possible anatomic anomalies, soprompt follow-up is crucial. Immune compromised There are several important points to rememberwhen clinicians encounter an immunocompro-mised patient. Often, the organisms causinginfection can be atypical in nature, so culture isimportant to document the organism and anti-biotic sensitivities. If the patient is immunocom-promised, one must have a much lower thresholdfor admission. If the patient is post-renal trans-plant, it is very important to car efully examine the transplanted kidney during the abdominal exam- ination. The transplanted organ typically lies inthe right lower quadrant, and excessive pain uponpalpation can signify either rejection or compli-cated pyelonephritis. In such cases, consultationwith the patient's nephrologist is required. Disposition The ultimate patient disposition depends uponseveral factors, including disease process, co-mor-bidities, and ability to follow directed therapy.Urinary obstruction with concomitant infectionpredisposes to renal abscess formation, so admis-sion with urinary drainage to bypass the obstruc-tion is mandatory. Pain that is not well controlledby oral agents, as well as persistent nausea andvomiting that prevent adequate hydration arealso considerations for hospital admission. An immunocompromised state, a problem with a soli-tary kidney, and a painful high-grade obstructionare relative indications for hospital admission, asare complicated social situations and pregnancy. Patients with intermittent obstruction second- ary to calculi need proper follow-up arranged.One pitfall in management is the erroneous con-clusion that the absence of pain means theabsence of obstruction. Irreversible renal damagecan be seen in as little as 2 weeks, so promptpatient follow-up is imperative. Confirmation ofcalculi passage is the gold standard. Instructpatients to strain their urine after discharge fromthe ED. This is much easier for the male patientto accomplish, using either a strainer or urinatingonto coffee filters. Upon passage, the patient is instructed to bring the stone to their primarycare provider. Crystallographic analysis of thestone is often difficult to arrange, costly to thepatient, and helpful only in genetic- or metabolic-induced nephrolithiasis.

Urinary-related complaints 554 Primary ComplaintsPrimary Complaints 555Vaginal bleeding Scope of the problem Acommon emergency department (ED) com- plaint is vaginal bleeding, accounting for up to 10% of ED visits in many centers. The differentialdiagnosis for vaginal bleeding is relatively short,with the most serious condition being ectopicpregnancy, and the most common conditionsbeing threatened miscarriage in the pregnantpatient and abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) inthe non-pregnant patient. According to the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC-P),there were 108,000 ectopic pregnancies reportedin the US in 1992. Ectopic pregnancies account for approximately 2% of reported pregnancies.Threatened miscarriage occurs in 20-30% of allpregnancies, and up to 50% of those threatenedwill go on to spontaneously abort. Septic abor-tions and gestational trophoblastic disease mustalso be considered in the differential diagnosis of vaginal bleeding in a pregnant woman, accountingfor 0.4-0.6 per 100,000 spontaneous miscarriagesand 0.1-1% of pregnancies, respectively. Anunderstanding of the definitions of the differentclassifications and management options for non-viable gestations is important for effective man-agement in the ED and for communication withconsultants. Second- and third-trimester bleed-ing and postpartum vaginal bleeding are not discussed in this chapter because these patientsare routinely evaluated in labor and deliveryareas and infrequently cared for by emergencyphysicians. Not all women with vaginal bleeding are pregnant. In the reproductive years, AUB isdefined as bleeding from the uterus that is irreg-ular in amount, timing, or duration. Prior tomenarche or following menopause, any uterinebleeding is considered abnormal. Dysfunctionaluterine bleeding (DUB) is a subset of AUB, and isdefined as abnormal bleeding unrelated to preg-nancy, exogenous gonadal steroids (such as oral contraceptives and hormone replacement), intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs), othermedical conditions, or structural uterine pathol-ogy. DUB is estimated to affect up to 20% ofreproductive-aged women. While diagnosis and ultimate treatment may be left to specialists, theacute care practitioner should have an under-standing of the various causes of AUB so that theappropriate acute intervention is offered. Pathophysiology Physiology of menstruation Normal menstrual bleeding results from the cyc-lical withdrawal of estrogens and progesteronethat occurs, on average, 14 days following ovula- tion in the absence of pregnancy (Figure 38.1). Menses typically last 4 or 5 days, with a normal range of 2-7 days. Flow is usually heaviest in thefirst 2-3 days and tapers to spotting in the last 2-3 days. The normal volume of blood lost in a single menses averages 30-40 ml; /H1102280 ml is considered excessive. For the typical woman of reproductive age, depletion of iron stores occurs when monthlyblood loss exceeds 60 ml. The term menorrhagia means excessive menstrual blood flow. Menses are normally predictable, with a cycle (first dayof one menses to the first day of the next) thatranges from 21 to 35 days. The regulation of menses is dependent upon a number of hormonal factors that result in theprocess of ovulation. If ovulation does not occur,as in anovulation associated with polycystic ovar-ian syndrome, the the proliferative of unopposed estro-gen. This endometrium will eventually build tothe point of instability and result in heavy, asyn-chronous bleeding, termed metrorrhagia . Following ovulation, the Graafian corpus luteum (CL), whichproduces abundant estradiol and progesterone.These hormones exert profound effects on theendometrium causing it to be receptive to implan-tation for a short period of time. In the absence of pregnancy, the CL involutes resulting in with-drawal of the effects of estradiol and progesteroneon the endometrium, culminating in sloughingand bleeding that comprises menstrual flow. The next steps in the menstrual process are all directed at establishing hemostasis and sub-sequent regeneration of the endometrium's super-ficial layer. The endometrium is unique in that platelets have relatively little role in the pr ocess38 Vaginal bleeding Pamela L. Dyne, MDand Rita Oregon, MDVaginal bleeding 556 Primary Complaintsof hemostasis. Instead, endometrial hemostasis relies first upon the presence of local vasocon- strictors, then on factors of the extrinsic and intrin-sic clotting cascades that result in the formationof a vascular clot. Once hemostasis has beenachieved, the processes of endometrial angio-genesis and re-epithelialization rebuild theendometrium, thereby preparing it for implant-ation should fertilization occur in the next cycle.The factors involved in the initiation of angio-genesis are unclear, but appear to be associatedwith rising estrogen levels. Fertilization, implantation, and embryology For pregnancy to occur, fertilization must take place after ovulation. This generally occurs in the ampullary region of the fallopian tube. Theovum, fertilized or not, then moves by ciliarytransport along the tube towards the uterineendometrial cavity. Implantation of the fertilizedovum in the endometrium occurs at about 7 dayspost-fertilization, which is approximately 3 weeksafter the last menstrual period (LMP). The developing embryo is surrounded by the tro-phoblast, which gives rise to the placenta andsecretes human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). It is hCG which prevents the degeneration of the CL, which continues to secrete adequateprogesterone levels to maintain the developinggestation. Ectopic pregnancy results from implantation of the fertilized ovum in a location other than theendometrium. Greater than 95% of ectopic preg-nancies implant in the fallopian tube. Of implant in the ampullary portion, 12% in theisthmus, 5% in the fimbriated end of the tube, and2% at the junction of the fallopian tube and uterus.The latter site of implantation is often referred toas an interstitial or cornual ectopic pregnancy.Interstitial ectopic pregnancies deserve because are rare (account-ing for only 2-3% of ectopic pregnancies) anddangerous, with a mortality rate more than twicethat of other tubal pregnancies (2.2% vs. /H110211%). Additional sites of ectopic implantation includethe abdomen, the cervix, and the ovary.

History Are you pregnant? This is the key question, as the entire thought process for caring for and diagnosing patients withvaginal bleeding is contingent on whether or notthey are pregnant. While many patients know theyare pregnant, many do not. Sixty-three percent ofthe time a woman who thinks she may be preg-nant is correct. However, about 11% of ED patientswho deny pregnancy are pregnant, and about 7%who report a normal menstrual history and denysexual contact are pregnant. Therefore, a negativehistory for pregnancy is unreliable. All women ofchildbearing age (12-55 years old) with vaginalbleeding should have a pregnancy test, regard-less of menstrual history. When was your last normal menstrual period, and are your periods usuallyregular? Despite the above discussion, it is useful to iden- tify approximately when the patient's LMP wasto attempt to date the pregnancy, should it beconfirmed. The most common reason for amen-orrhea (cessation of menses) is pregnancy. This isalso important information in the non-pregnantvaginal bleeding patient, as the pattern of her periods and current bleeding history are impor-tant to establish whether her abnormal bleeding is ovulatory (bleeding is cyclic and pre dictable) or anovulatory (neither cyclic nor predictable). When did the bleeding start, is the bleeding more than a usual period in quantity, isthe blood clotted or not, and are you dizzywith position change? These questions help provide a feel for how much blood has been lost. A recent onset of bleedingmay be more consistent with potentially life-threatening conditions, such as ectopic pregnancyand miscarriage, whereas more prolonged orinsidious bleeding is more suggestive of hormonaldysfunction. The actual amount of blood lost isusually difficult for a patient to quantify specifi-cally, so comparing the amount of blood lost to thewoman's usual menstrual flow may be helpful.Menstrual blood does not usually clot because offibrinolysis that occurs in the endometrium.However, clots in the menstrual flow indicate rela-tively heavy bleeding, because the blood does not remain in the uterus long enough for fibrinoly-sis to occur. The clinical significance of the bleed-ing (such as symptomatic anemia) is key since thishelps guide ED management and resuscitation, ifnecessary. Have you passed any tissue? The passage of fetal tissue may be helpful in excluding ectopic pregnancy in the right clinicalcontext. However, without products of conceptionto look at for confirmation by the clinician, theinformation is too unreliable to be of much value.Additionally, large clots or a decidual cast fromthe endometrium can also be passed and mimicproducts of conception in ectopic pregnancies,which may confuse the clinical scenario. What medications do you take? Are you on hormones or using some type of birthcontrol? Exogenous gonadal steroids (estrogens and prog- esterones) can be associated with AUB. Thesehormones may be being used for contraception orhormone been associatedwith heavy menses and AUB secondary to changesin the prostaglandin milieu of the endometrium.Becoming pregnant despite the use of an IUD is arisk factor for ectopic pregnancy. Any history of trauma? Vaginal bleeding in the setting of abdominal or pelvic trauma expands the differential diagnosis to include uterine rupture and placental abruptionin the pregnant patient. The trauma patient willgenerally be evaluated and resuscitated moreurgently because of the potential for rapid hemo-dynamic compromise. Pregnant women are at riskfor non-accidental abdominal and pelvic traumafrom current or p rior partners, which should be kept in mind dur ing patient evaluation.Associated symptoms Nausea and vomiting Gastrointestinal (GI) upset or distress may be the first symptom of early pregnancy in a womanwho is having AUB. Thus, it is important to rule-inor rule-out pregnancy at the beginning of anevaluation of nausea or vomiting. Pyelonephritisalso commonly presents with nausea and vomit-ing, and management of the pregnant patientwith pyelonephritis may differ from the non-pregnant patient. Fever or \"flu\" Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) may present with AUB secondary to concomitant endometritis.Septic abortion, which is any abortion (spontan-eous or induced) accompanied by infection, mayalso present with these symptoms. Urinary tract infection Dysuria is a common complaint in women with gynecologic (GYN) pathology, but hematuria froma urinary tract infection (UTI) or pyelonephritismay present with what is mistaken as vaginalbleeding and urinary symptoms. Dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, or near-syncope Does the patient have symptomatic anemia? Has the patient lost enough blood volume that she nowhas orthostatic hypotension? These symptomssuggest the clinician begin immediate fluid resus-citation, decide upon blood product replacement,and closely monitor vital signs. Past medical Obstetrical By convention, the number of pregnancies, regard- less of their result, is termed gravida , the number of live births is termed para, and the number of pregnancies that did not resul t in a live birth is termed abortions . These terms are short handed into G-P-Ab, such that a woman who has been pregnant five times, with three live births, onemiscarriage and one therapeutic abortion wouldhave her obstetrical history summarized byG 5P3Ab frequent (daily) douching, currentintrauterine contraceptive devices, orinfertility with or without treatment The most common cause of ectopic pregnancy is damage to the mucosa of the fallopian tube,which prevents transport of the fertilized ovumto the endometrial cavity. Mucosal damage is mostoften a result of tubal infection. Tubal surgery anddiethylstilbesterol exposure have been demon-strated to play a role in other causes, as well asdefects in tubal motility. Defects in the fertilizedovum itself may contribute to increased ectopicpregnancy risk due to impaired implantation priorto arrival in the endometrial cavity. Hormonalfactors have also been associated with an increasedrisk of ectopic pregnancy. Supraphysiologic levelsof estradiol or progesterone have been demon-strated to inhibit tubal migration, which mayaccount for the increased incidence of ectopicpregnancies in patients on ovulation-inductionagents (fertility agents, such as Clomid). There hasbeen an association of smoking and daily douch-ing with ectopic pregnancy as well, assumed tobe due to abnormal ciliary transport. Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy are import- ant to elicit, as 50% of women with ectopic preg-nancy will have one or more of these risk factors(Table 38.1). However, depending on the popula-tion, 25% of women with threatened abortion willhave one or more risk factors for ectopic. It isimportant to note that the presence of one or moreof these risk factors is helpful, but ectopic preg-nancy is still possible in their absence. Previous treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding, oligomenorrhea, or amenorrhea Oligomenorrhea is a decreased frequency of men-strualperiods, and amenorrhea is the cessation of menses. Such history would lead one to suspect Vaginal bleeding 558 Primary ComplaintsTable 38.1 Ectopic pregnancy risk factors Previous ectopic pregnancy Tubal infection Tubal or pelvic surgery Intrauterine contraceptive device usage Infertility for /H110222 years, treated or untreated Diethylstilbesterol exposure Smoking Frequent (daily) douchinganovulation and possibly DUB as the cause for the abnormal bleeding. Hirsuitism, obesity, acne, heat or cold intolerance, diarrhea, constipation, weightloss or gain, or galactorrhea Signs of androgen excess commonly associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome may point to acause of AUB. Other endocrinopathies, such asthyroid dysfunction (mainly hypothyroidism) andhyperprolactinemia can cause AUB and would berelevant to the work-up if there were such a history. Easy bruising, excessive bleeding,or familial bleeding tendencies that maywarrant investigation of a coagulopathy Vaginal bleeding might be the presenting sign of a coagulopathy, such as idiopathic thrombocyto- penic purpura (ITP) or von Willebrand's disease. Medications Use of platelet inhibitors such as aspirin or Plavix, or other anticoagulants like warfarin or low-molecular-weight heparin would be importantto elicit, because the vaginal bleeding might beiatrogenic. Use of ovulation-induction agents arecrucial because of the increased risk for ectopicand twin gestations with these agents. Addition-ally, concomitant intrauterine and ectopic preg-nancies, termed heterotopic pregnancy , can occur with significantly increased frequency in womenusing these agents. This fact impacts the diagnosticaccuracy of conventional tests used for excludingectopic pregnancy, including pelvic ultrasoundand quantitative /H9252-hCG levels. Physical examination General appearance One should immediately assess if the patientappears to be in distress secondary to pelvic orabdominal pain. A pale, diaphoretic patient is wor-risome for hemoperitoneum and requires moreurgent and aggressive intervention than thepatient who appears well. Vital signs Blood pressure and pulse are key vital signs toassess. However, young healthy patients maybecome symptomatic from significant blood loss(dizzy or near-syncopal) before their vital signsbecome abnormal. Elevated temperature mayimply an infectious etiology for the patient'ssymptoms. Abdomen The abdomen should be evaluated thoroughlyfor signs of hemoperitoneum. Distention, rigidity,rebound, and guarding, as well as localization of pain should be assessed. Pelvic Aspeculum examination is an essential part of the assessment of AUB of any type. However, there ismuch information to be obtained by visualinspection of the external genitalia prior to theinsertion of the speculum. Assess the vulva, anus,and urethra for non-uterine sources of bleedingand areas of infection or inflammation. Uponspeculum insertion, a vaginal wet mount, cervicalgonorrhea and chlamydia cultures should beobtained. While these are collected, evaluate forforeign bodies, masses, vaginal synechiae, or lacer-ations and note the quality and quantity of bloodor clots in the vaginal vault. Bright red bloodimplies ongoing bleeding, whereas brownish dis-charge is more consistent with bleeding that hasalready stopped. Inspect the cervix as well forevidence of trauma, active bleedi ng, expulsion of tissue, or mass aris ing from the cervix. If the cervix is difficult to visu alize due to bleeding or discharge, a ringed forceps with a small gauzemay be gently inserted to clean the area. Acareful bimanual examination is a routine component of the evaluation of a woman withvaginal bleeding. It is performed in order to assessthe uterus and adnexae for size and for tenderness,as well as the status of the internal cervical os in thepregnant patient. The external cervical os mayremain slightly open to fingertip in any woman who has delivered a baby. However, the internalcervical os only opens (dilates) when uterine con-tents are in the process of being expelled. The inter-nal os is examined by inserting the index fingerthrough the external os. If there is the sensationthat the finger in the opening enters without resist-ance, the internal os is open. If the finger is stoppedby closed tissue, then the internal os is closed.After assessing for patency, the cervix should beheld between the second and third fingers of theexamining hand and gently moved from side toside to assess for cervical motion tenderness(CMT). This may be found in conditions thatinvolve peritoneal or pelvic floor inflammation or Primary Complaints 559Vaginal bleedingirritation, although it is a nonspecific finding. Next, the uterus is palpated between the exam-iner's intravaginal hand and the hand on thepatient's suprapubic area. The uterine size, shape,position, and contour are assessed, as well as itsdegree of tenderness. Uterine size may be esti-mated by comparison to common standard-sizedobjects, such as a golf ball (normal, non-pregnant),baseball (4-6 weeks gestational age), or softball(6-8 weeks gestational age). Lastly, the adnexae arepalpated to assess for ovarian size, tenderness, andmasses. The ovaries are normally non-palpable inpost-menopausal women, and are the size of wal-nuts in pre-menopausal women. In order to maximize the yield from the pelvic examination, the patient should be as comfort-able as possible. If the patient is in significant dis-tress with abdominal or pelvic pain, it is prudentto medicate the patient with appropriate anal-gesia before attempting to perform this examina-tion. The choice of analgesic agent should takeinto consideration whether the patient is preg-nant or lactating, and avoidance of agents thatalter clotting function (aspirin and non-steroidalanti-inflammatory agents, such as ketorolac andibuprofen) is wise. While there are not studiesspecifically addressing the safety and efficacy of premedicating a woman in distress before pelvic examination, there is literature to support thispractice in patients with abdominal pain beforeabdominal examination. Thus, appropriate anal-gesia should not be withheld. Additionally, whilea bimanual examination is routine in this setting,there are data that suggest poor inter-examinerreliability of the bimanual pelvic examination, which questions the utility of this portion of theexamination in the non-pregnant female. Auscultation for fetal heart tones Fetal heart tones (FHTs) should be heard using ahand-held Doppler on the suprapubic area if thefetus is at least 12 weeks estimated gestational age(EGA). FHTs may be audible at 10 weeks EGA,but there is no cause for concern unless they arenot present at 12 weeks EGA, provided a woman'sdates are accurate. A normal fetal heart rate isbetween 120 and 160 bpm. It is important to doc- ument the presence, rate, and location of the FHTs if the patient is /H1102212 weeks EGA, as it is both a verification of dates and viability of the gestationat that point in time.

Diagnostic testing Laboratory studies Urine pregnancy test Aurine qualitative pregnancy test is absolutely necessary in the work-up of anywoman of repro- ductive age with abnormal bleeding. The sensitiv- ity for diagnosing pregnancy is 99.4%, so it is anextremely useful test for ruling-out pregnancy byapproximately the same date that a womanmisses her period, or possibly a few days before,when the serum /H9252-hCG is /H1102225 mIU/ml. False negative tests when the serum /H9252-hCG isbetween 10 and 50 mIU/ml, and also when theurine is dilute (specific gravity /H110211.015). This may be overcome by using 20 drops of urine instead ofthe usual 5 drops to super-concentrate the hor-mone on the test diaphragm. The urine pregnancytest establishes the patient as pregnant, andshould be ordered for all patients with vaginalbleeding, regardless of the patient's menstrual history. Urinalysis Aurinalysis with urine culture should be ordered in all pregnant patients with vaginal bleeding to Vaginal bleeding 562 Primary ComplaintsTable 38.3 Differential diagnosis of non-pregnant vaginal bleeding ( cont)diagnose UTI, regardless of symptoms. Generally, a catheterized specimen is best in this setting,given the difficulty in obtaining a true \"cleancatch\" in a woman with vaginal bleeding. It hasbeen well-described that UTIs are an etiologic riskfactor for miscarriage. asymptomatic bac-turia and pyuria are relatively common in preg-nancy, occurring in 2-11% of pregnant women.Up to one-fourth of these asymptomatic womenwill go on to develop upper-tract infections. Thus,UTIs in pregnant patients should be looked forand treated to potentially prevent miscarriage. Rh type Routine screening for Rhesus (Rh) status in the pregnant vaginal bleeding patient is controversial.It has been well-established that completed abor-tion, ectopic pregnancy, antepartum hemorrhageand trauma are associated with possible feto-maternal transfusion, and thus potential for Rhisoimmunization if the mother is Rh-negative andthe fetus is Rh-positive. Literature support for thesame concept in threatened abortion is equivocal.However, ED patients may not have access to orseek follow-up if they complete their miscarriage,and it would be unfortunate if such a patientbecame Rh-sensitized without prophylaxis. It isthus standard of care to give Rh immune prophy-laxis to Rh-negative, pregnant women with vagi-nal bleeding. If the gestational age is /H1102112 weeks, a dose of 50 mcg Rhogam intramuscularly is suffi-cient. However, as pregnancy dating is difficultand often inaccu rate, it is recommended that all unsensitized Rh- negative women with vaginal bleeding receive 300 mcg of Rh immune globulinin the first or second trimester. This should begiven before the patient leaves the ED, but protec-tion occurs if it is administered within 72 hours ofbleeding. It is not necessary to repeat the dosage atsubsequent ED or clinic visits for continued orrepeat bleeding before 20 weeks gestation. A sub- sequent 300 mcg dose should be administered inthe third trimester or prior to delivery. Complete blood count Acomplete blood count (CBC) is routinely obtained in bleeding patients in order to estimate how much they have bled prior to arrival in theED. A baseline hematocrit (HCT) is also useful forcomparison if serial HCTs are obtained duringthe patient's course due changes status.Serum quantitative beta-human chorionicgonadotropin The serum quantitative /H9252-hCG is a measure of trophoblastic tissue activity, a marker for the vol- ume of living trophoblastic tissue. It is a functionof renal clearance. Both ectopic and intrauterinepregnancies (IUPs) produce /H9252-hCG, though they usually differ in the rate at which the quantita-tive /H9252-hCG level increases. Patients with ectopic pregnancy tend to have a lower quantitative /H9252-hCG than those with viable IUPs given the same gestational age. Abnormal IUPs may alsohave lower /H9252-hCGs than normal IUPs. Due to the large range of acceptable /H9252-hCG levels for each stage of embryonic development, a single value of/H9252-hCG is not useful for differentiating between normal IUP , abnormal IUP , and ectopic pregnancy.Variation in the expected rate of rise of the /H9252-hCG level can be helpful. For levels /H1102110,000 mIU/ml, the /H9252-hCG normally doubles in 1.9 /H110060.5 days. Also, an increase of /H11091 66% over 48 hours is seen in 85% of normal IUPs. An abnormal increase isthus /H1102166% over 48 hours, which is 75% sensitive and 93% specific for an abnormal gestation of some variety. Additionally, 85% of ectopic preg- nancies and 15% of normal of Declining indi- cate fetal non-viability, either ectopic or intrauter-ine. The rate of fall of the /H9252-hCG has been found to differ significantly between these two entities.The half-life of the /H9252-hCG is /H110227 days in ectopic pregnancy, whereas it is /H110211.4 days in failing IUPs. Afalling /H9252-hCG does not exclude the possibility of tubal r upture, and there is no minimum value of /H9252-hCG that pr ecludes rupture. Radiologic studies Ultrasound The value of pelvic endovaginal ultrasonography (EVUS) in the evaluation of a pregnant vaginalbleeding patient is principally to confirm thepresence of an IUP , which ostensibly excludesthe diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. An under-standing of what is necessary to make the sono-graphic diagnosis of an IUP is important for theclinician to optimally use the information. The hor-mones of pregnancy cause an early uterine decid-ual reaction that may be seen soon after a missedmenses by ultrasound. This is nonspecific andoccurs with both IUPs and ectopic preg nancies, however. The earliest sonographic landmark con-sistent with an IUP is the gestational sac. With endovaginal ultrasound, this can be visualized Primary Complaints 563Vaginal bleedingVaginal bleeding 564 Primary Complaintsas early as 4.5 weeks after the LMP , reliably by 5 weeks. The gestational sac lies eccentricallywithin the decidua of the endometrium, and isseen to distinct layers sonographically:the decidua and decidua parietalis.These two layers give two rings, called the \"double ring sign,\" that isdiagnostic of an intrauterine gestational sac. Theyolk sac seen within the gestational sac is the nextsonographic landmark of the developing preg-nancy, seen reliably by the end of the 5th week(Figure 38.2). The embryo and cardiac activityare seen concurrently and reliably adjacent to theyolk sac by 6.5 weeks gestation using endovaginalultrasound. Table 38.4 lists the sonographic find-ings of early pregnancy development with theircorresponding gestational ages and discrimi-natory levels of /H9252-hCG. The sonographic finding that is most reassur- ing for a favorable prognosis is the presence ofembryonic cardiac activity. For women under 35years of age at 8 weeks EGA, the sonographicpresence of cardiac activity suggests a rate ofspontaneous abortion of only 3-5% overall. Thisincreases to about 8% for women over 35 years ofage. Sonographic findings that foreshadow a pooroutcome include a slow embryonic heart rate(/H1102190 bpm), small gestational sac for the size of the embryo, and large yolk sac ( /H110226mm). Differentiation between complete and incom- plete abortion can be challenging if the cervical osis closed, bleeding is not heavy, and the patient isnot appreciably tender on examination. In this set-ting, ultrasound is a reliable and useful adjunct tomaking the diagnosis of completed abortionbased on the presence of an empty uterus. Specific findings suggestive or diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy will be identified by ultra-sound in up to 79% of ED cases (Figure 38.3). Intrauterine findings suggestive of ectopic preg- nancy include the intrauterine decidual reaction.This can be problematic because 10-20% of thetime it can form a cystic shape resembling a sac.This is referred to as a \"pseudogestational sac,\"which is thought to repr esent blood sur rounded by decidual cast. The finding of an empty uterus ina pregnant woman is present in up to 20% of casesof ectopic pregnancy. Extrauterine findings onEVUS may also be consistent with ectopic preg-nancy; the most common finding is a complexadnexal mass, seen in 60-90% of cases. Other findings seen include free fluid in the cul-de-sac(20-40%) and an ectopic embryo (25-35%). Figure 38.2 Normal intrauterine pregnancy.

When EVUS is neither diagnostic of an IUP nor suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy, it is char-acterized as indeterminate. Interpretation of thisresult requires consideration of the clinical context. Depending on their clinical status and /H9252-hCG level, these patients will need to be followedclosely by a gynecologist in order to have their /H9252-hCG level re-checked in 48 hours along with a reassessment of their clinical status. In the non-pregnant woman with vaginal bleeding, an EVUS is a useful adjunct to the phys-ical examination, particularly if an adequate pelvicexamination cannot be performed or the patienthas an abnormal pelvic examination (i.e., adnexal mass, enlarged uterus). In post-menopausal women who are not on HRT with AUB, EVUS can be utilized to measurethe endometrial thickness. An of the bleeding,which obviates the need for endometrial biopsy. General treatment principles As with all ED patients, treatment begins with a general assessment of the patient's hemody-namic status. Patients with vaginal bleeding pre-sent with varying clinical states, which maychange during their evaluation period in the ED.While any such patient may be or become hemo-dynamically compromised, pregnant vaginalbleeding patients have the greatest potential for rapid change in volume status. Hence, frequent reassess ment of these patients is prudent. Volume repletion Not all patients with vaginal bleeding r equire intravenous (IV) access or IV fluid replacement.However, most first trimester pregnant vaginalbleeding patients will undergo a work-up forectopic pregnancy, a potentially life-threateningcondition due to exsanguination. Therefore, such patients should have an IV placed upon initial assessment. The degree of volume replacementrequired will vary depending on the patient's clinical status. Crystalloids (normal saline) areappropriate as initial resuscitation fluids, addingpacked red blood cell transfusion if the patient'sclinical status deteriorates despite aggressive volume r eplacement. As most of these patients are young and otherwise healthy, they should be able to tolerate significant anemia (e.g., down to aHCT of 20%) before blood transfusion is needed.For women with history or risk factors for cardiacischemia, significant anemia is akin to a car diac stress test and may not be well-tolerated. Thus a different standard for transfusion is prudent insuch patients. Patients diagnosed with or suspected of having septic abortion should receive broad spectrum IVantibiotics as soon as possible. Ectopic pregnancy Areasonably thorough understanding of the non-surgical management options for patientsdiagnosed with ectopic pregnancy in the ED isimportant for emergency physicians, becausethese options involve discharging a patient fromthe ED with a potentially life-threatening surgi-cal emergency. Medical management is withmethotrexate, a folic acid antagonist that preventsthe synthesis of amino acids, ribonucleic acid(RNA), and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), therebyeradicating rapidly developing trophoblastic tissue. The criteria for methotrexate therapy are: Hemodynamic stability EVUS showing an unruptured ectopic pregnancy with greatest diameter /H110214c m (/H110213.5 cm if cardiac activity present) No active bleeding or free fluid onultrasound Stable or rising /H9252-hCG titer /H110215000 mIU/ml /H9252-hCG increasing after curettage Desired future fertility Patient does not desire surgical therapy Patient willingness and ability to return forweekly follow-up Some cases of cervical and cornual pregnancy. The contraindications to methotrexate therapy are hepatic or renal dysfunction, active peptic ulcer disease, or blood dyscrasias. The protocol for man-agement with methotrexate involves a singleintramuscular (IM) injection of 50 mcg/m 2body surface area, with close GYN follow-up and serial/H9252-hCG levels. The success rate for this protocol is 85-100% for resolving the ectopic pregnancywithout surgical intervention. However, it takesbetween 20 and 44 days for the /H9252-hCG levels to become undetectable. The main complication ofmethotrexate therapy is tubal rupture, whichoccurs in about 4% of cases. Methotrexate has aVaginal bleeding 566 Primary Complaintsvariety of side effects, the most common of which is increased abdominal pain in up to 60% ofpatients. This is problematic, as this symptom isindistinguishable from tubal rupture if severe innature. Patients who have been treated for ectopicpregnancy with methotrexate and complain ofincreasing abdominal pain should have animmediate ultrasound and GYN consultation toevaluate for this potentially serious complication.Other side effects are nausea, vomiting, and diar-rhea, which occur in 5-20% of cases. Surgical management of ectopic pregnancy is reserved for patients who do not fall into the medical management gr oup described above. This is generally done either by tube-sparinglaparoscopic salpingotomy, salpingectomy, orthrough open laparotomy, which may be requiredfor patients in extremis or with significant hemo-peritoneum. Abnormal uterine bleeding Gonadal steroids are the first-line therapeuticoption for vaginal bleeding in the non-pregnantpatient. Immediate therapy for severe symptom-atic bleeding for patients hemodynamically compromised requiring hospital admission may consist of high dose conjugated estrogens. Startingdoses of 25 mg IV every 4 hours for up to 48 hoursusually results in the desired response within thefirst 5 hours. For more stable patients, oral treat-ment with medroxyprogesterone 60-120 mg onday one followed by 20 mg daily for 10 days iseffective in halting AUB. Another alternative, espe-cially for pre-menopausal patients, is combined estrogen and progestin oral contraceptive pills(OCP). A monophasic pill preparation (constantdosage throughout pill-pack month) with atleast mcg estradiol is utilized in thefollowing manner: 3 pills/day for 3 days, then 2 pills/day for 2 days, then 1 pill/ day and con-tinue until the package is finished. This regimen is termed the \"OCP taper.\" Women should skip the placebo pills in the first pack and start the nextpack of 1 pill/day to avoid withdrawal bleedingso soon after the previous bleeding episode.Ideally, estrogen therapy should not be initiatedon patients until the diagnosis of endometrialcarcinoma has been excluded. A general guide-line is that for women over the age of 40, endomet-rial sampling should be obtained either prior toor within a week of initiating hormone therapy.Additionally, OCPs and estrogens are in generalnot recommended for women who have hyper- tension or smoke, so their use in this settingshould only be with caution and in consultationwith the patient's gynecologist. Disposition First-trimester vaginal bleeding Patients for whom the diagnosis of ectopic preg-nancy is made conclusively by EVUS requireimmediate GYN consultation, because they mustinitiate either surgical or medical management.This depends on the patient's hemodynamic sta-bility, and if she meets criteria for methotrexateusage. Patients with first-trimester bleeding, a /H9252-hCG below 1500 mIU/ml, and an indeterminate EVUSmay be sent home from the ED with a diagnosisof \"possible ectopic pregnancy\" if they remainhemodynamically follow-up and a repeat /H9252-hCG measure- ment in 48 hours by their OB/GYN physician. Itis appropriate for these follow-up arrangementsto be made prior to ED disposition in order toensure compliance with the recommendation.When discharging patients from the ED, it isessential that they comprehend the potentiallylife-threatening nature of the condition and under-stand specific instructions for when to return to the ED in advance of their scheduled follow-up.These indications include dizziness or syncope,increased abdominal pain or heavy vaginal bleed-inggreater than one pad per hour, and fever. They should also be advised to remain at pelvicrest (nothing inside the vagina). There is no evi- dence that bed rest is necessary. Patients diagnosed with inevitable or septic abortion require immediate GYN consultation forsurgical intervention. Patients with threatened and completed abor- tion do not require GYN consultation in the ED.In these patients for whom ectopic pregnancyhas been excluded, follow-up with their OB/GYN in 1-2 weeks is appropriate, with carefuldischarge instructions recommending return pre-cautions described above. Patients with incomplete and missed abortions are managed differently in different practice environments, and in some cases, depending on patient preference. Some gynecologists andpatients prefer expectant management witharranged follow-up to perform semi-urgent D&C at the time ofinitial diagnosis. The literature does not favorPrimary Complaints 567Vaginal bleedingeither management style, so patient and physician preferences should be taken into account. It is important to discuss the common nature of spontaneous miscarriage with the patient,emphasizing to the patient (and her partner, ifappropriate) that she did nothing to precipitatethe situation. Many patients will have a signifi-cant emotional response to having a miscarriage,and a few minutes of reassurance and correctinformation from a caring provider can frame thesituation in a way that facilitates emotional heal-ing. Additionally, keep in mind that pregnantwomen are at increased risk for being victims ofintimate partner violence. Non-pregnant abnormal uterine bleeding Generally patients with AUB do not require urgent GYN consultation unless they require admissionto the hospital due to severe anemia or acute hem orrhage. Women over 40 years of age for whom hormone therapy is indicated should haveendometrial sampling either prior to or within 1 week of hormone initiation. Since this procedure generally falls outside of the scope of emergencyphysician practice, specific follow-up should be arranged from the ED. Patients under 40 years ofage may begin outpatient management as dis-cussed above, and have follow-up arranged for 1-2 weeks with a gynecologist. Specific ED returnprecautions include symptoms of severe anemia (excessive fatigue, orthostasis, syncope) or increased bleeding. Patients should contact andfollow-up with their gynecologist or primarycare provider if the bleeding does not improvewithin 3-5 days of initiation of therapy. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Obtain a pregnancy test on every woman of childbearing age with abdominal and/orpelvic complaints. A negative history forpregnancy and/or sexual activity isunreliable, and the differential diagnosis isvery different whether the patient is or is notpregnant. Every patient with first-trimester bleedingwithout a documented IUP must have ectopic pregnancy ruled-out. This should include a quantitative /H9252-hCG and EVUS in the ED, and appropriate follow-up for those withindeterminate results. There is no minimum/H9252-hCG level below which one should nolonger consider ectopic pregnancy or notobtain an ultrasound. Keep in mind that over 80% of patients with ectopic pregnancyhave a /H9252-hCG /H110211000 mIU/ml, and 79% of ED patients with first-trimester bleeding will be diagnosed in the ED by EVUS. Patients diagnosed with ectopic pregnancyby EVUS may be candidates for methotrexatetreatment if they meet strict criteria and donot have contraindications. However, thedecision to treat the patient withmethotrexate should be made by theconsulting gynecologist. Patients treated with methotrexate must beable to return to the ED immediately shouldthey experience increased abdominal pain,because methotrexate does not alter the 4%risk for rupture of the ectopic pregnancy inthe short term (approximately 1 week). When these patients return to the ED withincreased abdominal or pelvic pain, a EVUSand gynecology consultation should beobtained immediately to rule-out a rupturedectopic. Patients on ovulation-induction agents are atsignificantly increased risk for heterotopicpregnancy, up to 1 : 34 pregnancies. Thus it isessential to specifically ask the patient if shehas taken these medications. Patients diagnosed with intrauterine fetal demise do not require an emergent D&C. It is appropriate to manage these patientsexpectantly, if desired by the patient and theconsulting gynecologist. Patients with possible septic abortion shouldreceive pr ompt IV broad-spectrum antibiotics, even before the confirmatoryEVUS is obtained or specialist consultationarrives, as these infections may progress veryrapidly.

Vaginal bleeding 568 Primary ComplaintsPrimary Complaints 569Vomiting Scope of the problem Vomiting is a common presenting complaint to the emergency department (ED), accounting for nearly 2 million annual visits. It has no age orgender predilection, and has many etiologies.The most common causes of vomiting are acutegastroenteritis, febrile systemic illness, and drug-related effects. The emergency physician's main responsibility is differentiating the emergent and life-threatening causes of vomiting from thosecaused by more benign entities. The remainderof ED management is targeted toward symptomalleviation and rehydration. Pathophysiology Vomiting is induced by physical stimulation of the back of the throat (gag reflex), mucosal irritationof the upper digestive tract, stimulation of medulla oblongata, stimu-lation by biochemical emetic stimuli on thechemoreceptor trigger zone in the area postrema,or by severe emotion. Nausea frequently precedesvomiting and is marked by reduced gastric toneand peristalsis. Regurgitation, by contrast, is thepassive retrograde movement of esophageal con-tents into the mouth, as in gastroesophageal reflux. True vomiting refers to the rapid ejection of gastric contents. The abdominal muscles rapidlycontract, while the cardia of the stomach, esoph-agus, and throat remain open with the glottisclosed. Copious salivation usually precedes vom-iting, and serves to lubricate the digestive tract anddilute the gastric acid. Repeated contractions ofthe abdominal muscles against a relaxed stomachproduce retching. The repetitive abdominal con-tractions build up a pressure gradient in the stom-achprior to vomiting. This allows gastric contents to move to the upper portion of the stomach.Retching may also occur without expulsion ofgastric contents, and is referred to as \"dry heaves.\" Repeated vomiting can lead to hypovolemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. A forcefulepisode of vomiting or (GI) bleeding (Mallory-Weiss tear) oresophageal (Boerhaave's syndrome).History What did you vomit (food, blood, mucus)? The composition of the vomitus is important for determining both the etiology of vomiting andtreatment. If the vomitus is coffee-ground mate-rial, this most often represents blood that hasbeen exposed to the stomach's acidic environment.If the blood is bright red, an esophageal or vas-cular source of bleeding is likely. It is importantto determine the volume of blood and whether itoccurred initially with vomiting or after severalepisodes of vomiting. Mallory-Weiss tears gen-erally occur following several episodes of force-ful vomiting, and can also be a source for bloodin the vomitus. Vomitus containing undigestedfood may be seen with gastric outlet obstruction,gastric retention, and psychogenic vomiting.Vomitus with mucous must be differentiated from coughing or spitting up phlegm. Otherpotential contents of vomitus include bile andstool, both of which portend a serious etiology. Was there anything that preceded or is associated with the vomiting (coughing, abdominal pain)? Vomiting does not mean the same thing to all people. Frequently, patients will cough, which evokes a gag reflex causing them to \"vomit.\"Vomiting as a consequence of severe coughing is known as post-tussive emesis. Abdominal painmay follow vomiting; this may be related toforceful abdominal muscle contraction. Vomitingwhich follows the development of abdominalpain is nonspecific; however, pain relieved byvomiting may suggest gastric outlet obstruction.Areport of vomiting prior to chest pain is an ominous sign, and is likely due to a non-GI cause. How many times did you vomit? Although the exact answer is not necessary, this provides an indication of whether the vomitingoccurred only once or several times. If the patienthas been vomiting several times, it may increasethe likelihood of dehydration or underlying39 Vomiting Jennifer A. Oman, MDVomiting 570 Primary Complaintspathology (e.g., Mallory-Weiss tear), in addition to suggesting the cause. When did the vomiting occur? Vomiting in the morning is more common during pregnancy and uremia. Vomiting associated with increased intracranial pressure may be more frequent when intracranial pressure is higher,such as in the morning or with bending move-ments. Vomiting less than 1 hour after eatingmay be related to gastroparesis or gastric outletobstruction. Have you been able to tolerate liquids or fluids between the vomiting episodes? This question helps to assess the patient's hydra- tion status. Associated symptoms Gastrointestinal Ask about abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, or inability to pass gas . If constipation or the inability to pass gas accompanies vomiting in a patientwith prior surgeries, bowel obstruction must beconsidered. Vomiting preceded by abdominal painhas a broad differential. Abdominal pain tem-porarily relieved by vomiting suggests delayedgastric emptying, as with gastropar esis from dia- betes or gastric outlet obstruction. When vomit- ing is associated with diarrhea, a GI infectiousetiology is likely responsible. Neurologic Ask about headache, dizziness, vertigo, weakness, numbness or tingling of the extremities . Serious causes of vomiting include subarachnoid hemor- rhage and increased intracranial pressure from obstruction, tumor, or infection. Any cause ofincreased intracranial pressure can cause vomit-ing with or without preceding nausea by directinteraction on vomiting centers in the areapostrema. Causes of vertigo, such as labyrinthitisand M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, produce vomiting bystimulation of the vestibular nuclei and subse-quent stimulation of brainstem nuclei. Vomitingis a common symptom of migraine headache. Asudden-onset severe or atypical headache may represent a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Meningitis may also present as headache and fever associ-ated with vomiting.Genitourinary (in females) Ask about dysuria, back pain, vaginal discharge, vagi- nal bleeding, lower abdominal cramping, sexual his-tory, sexually transmitted illness (STI) history, andpregnancy . Vomiting is associated with pyelonephri- tis,pelvic inflammatory ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy normal first-trimester pregnancy. about testicular or . Testicular torsion or an incarcerated hernia can present with vomiting and groin or testicular pain. Cardiopulmonary Ask about chest pain, cough and fever . Vomiting can be associated with myocardial infarction. Remember not all vomiting is true vomiting; the patient may have phlegm production frompneumonia. Other Ask about other symptoms. These include recent chemotherapy if the patient has cancer, inges- tions if the patient is depressed or suicidal, otherfamily members who may be vomiting if the ill-ness is acute, recent trauma to the abdomen orhead, what the patient ate (home canned goods,raw fish, food at a picnic), and atypical hobbies(foraging for wild mushrooms). Past medical The patient's medical history is an importantadjunct to determining the source of vomiting.Common conditions associated with vomitinginclude hypertension, liver disease, cholelithiasis,excessive alcohol use, previous surgeries, recenthead or abdominal trauma, thyroid disorders,renal insufficiency or failure, chemotherapy, dia- betes, current pregnancy, cardiac disease, orperipheral vascular disease. A thorough medica-tion list of all current and recent previous medica-tions, including all over-the-counter, herbal, and\"natural\" medicines must be obtained. Physical examination Athorough physical examination must be per- formed, as several etiologies of vomiting are notisolated to one anatomic system. The current andPrimary Complaints 571Vomitingpast medical history, plus associated symptoms will help guide which portions of the examina-tion need increased attention. General appearance The patient's general appearance can range fromnormal to severe distress from discomfort, con-tinued vomiting, dehydration, or the underlyingcause of vomiting. Vital signs Special attention to the patient's pulse and blood pressure are essential in determining the patient'shydration status. However, the absence of tachy-cardia does not exclude significant dehydrationor disease. The blood pressure is especially con-cerning if it is abnormally low or high. Changesin orthostatic blood pressure are mostly of histori-cal significance and do not aid in determining the patient's volume status. If the patient becomesdizzy or lightheaded with standing, this may indi-cate significant fluid loss. If the patient is pregnant,fetal heart tones should be obtained if possible. The presence of a fever may indicate an infec- tious or inflammatory response, or a toxic inges-tion, and requires prompt evaluation. Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat Head Examine the head for hematomas and bruising. Eyes Visual acuity should be determined for patients with vomiting and visual complaints to screen for conditions such as acute angle closure glaucoma. Aclose examination of the pupils should be per- formed to look for symmetry and normal reactiv-ity. A funduscopic examination is nec essary to look for papilledema, which may indicate a braintumor. Visual fields should also be tested todetermine the presence of a deficit. Extraocularmovements should be evaluated and any nystag-mus noted. Nose The nose should be inspected for evidence of bleeding if the patient is complaining of vomit-ing blood.Mouth Examine the mucus membranes for dryness and evidence of bleeding. Abdomen The abdominal examination will often be themost important examination; a complete exami- nation must be performed on every vomitingpatient. On inspection of the abdomen, the presence of previous surgical scars should be noted andinquired about to determine their etiology. Theabdomen should be observed for peristaltic waveswhen an obstruction is suspected. Abdominaldistention should be noted and may be due toexcess fluid or air within the peritoneal cavity. Bowel sounds should be assessed. The pres- ence of high-pitched, rushing bowel sounds (bor-borygmi) may indicate an obstruction. Normal orabsent bowel sounds are unhelpful in elucidat-ing the etiology of vomiting. Localized tenderness is helpful and may guide therapy and diagnostic studies. The abdom- inal examination may be difficult to interpret ifthe patient has had several episodes of emesis.Serial examinations or return for re-evaluationmay be necessary to determine the etiology ofvomiting. Genital Tenderness of the lower abdominal area of female patients mandates a pelvic examination to iden-tify cervical motion tenderness, adnexal masses,pus from the cervical os, and vaginal bleeding.Male patients with persistent vomiting require atesticular examination to palpate for masses ortenderness, and to assure normal lie and size. Rectal Adigital rectal examination should be performed on patients to look for the presence of stool, bleed-ing, or mass. Neurologic Acomplete neurologic examination, including assessment of mental status, motor strength, sen-sation, cranial nerves, cerebellar function, and gaitshould be performed on all patients with headacheassociated with vomiting.Extremity Distal pulse presence, amplitude, and symmetry should be noted. Any edema of the lower extrem-ities should be noted and recorded.Skin Assess the patient's skin turgor when evaluatingvolume status, and note jaundice, paleness, tem-perature, or flushing.

Laboratory studies Bedside glucose Abedside glucose should be performed on patients who look ill and complain of vomiting. Complete blood count Acomplete blood count (CBC) is not usually helpful unless blood loss is suspected. Chemistry panel In an otherwise healthy young adult with vomit- ing for less than a day, a chemistry panel will addlittle. In patients with an underlying disease, espe-cially diabetes, or tenuous health status, morecomprehensive laboratory testing guided by his-tory and suspected diagnosis may be beneficial.The likelihood of an abnormality increases due todecreased compensatory mechanisms. Urinalysis Aurinalysis should also be ordered to evaluate urine concentration and identify urinary tract infection (UTI). Pregnancy test Aurine or serum pregnancy test should be ordered on all females of child-bearing age. Other tests Liver function tests (LFTs) are of equivocal value in the evaluation of the patient with suspected gall-bladder disease. However, they are useful if hepa-titis is suspected. A serum amylase and lipaseshould be ordered if pancreatitis is suspected. Ifthe patient has liver disease and is vomiting blood,a prothrombin time/International NormalizedRatio (PT/INR) and type and If cardiac ischemia is suspected as theetiology of vomiting, cardiac enzymes should beobtained. Electrocardiogram All patients with presumed cardiac-inducedvomiting need an electrocardiogram (ECG).Radiologic studies Plain films Akidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) X-ray series is not indicated in the evaluation of vomiting. An acute abdominal series (AAS) is indicated forpatients with previous surgeries, the presence ofa hernia on physical examination, suspectedingestion of radiopaque drugs, tympany, or highsuspicion for bowel obstruction. A chest X-ray (CXR) may be indicated if the \"vomiting\"is actually a gag reflex evoked by coughing. Computed tomography Computed tomography (CT) of the brain should be performed on any patient with suspectedincreased intracranial pressure, intracranialbleeding, head trauma, or intracranial pathology(brain tumor or cysts). An abdominal CT is indi-cated for patients over the age of 55 years with anunclear vomiting etiology, or those with persist-ent symptoms such as abdominal pain, history of abdominal trauma, suspicion of appendicitisor mass which is not obvious on physical exami-nation. Ultrasound If one suspects gallbladder pathology, a right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound should be performed. A pelvic ultrasound should be per-formed on female patients in whom there is sus- picion for ovarian torsion, tubo-ovarian abscess, or an undocumented A testicular ultra-sound should be obtained whenever testicular torsion or mass is suspected. Other If the patient is vomiting blood, a nasogastric(NG) tube should be placed to determine thequantity and intensity of bleeding. General treatment principles Volume repletion Regardless of the etiology of vomiting, the Airway, Breathing, and Circulation (ABCs) mustfirst be addressed and stabilized. If the patient isin circulatory col lapse, venous access with two Vomiting 576 Primary ComplaintsPrimary Complaints 577Vomitinglarge bore peripheral IVs must be established and a fluid bolus of normal saline administered. The administration of fluids to the vomiting patient can be accomplished in several ways.Sometimes, oral rehydration may be attempted,especially in children. Depending on the under-lying etiology of the vomiting, IV rehydrationmay be more efficient. An IV also allows accessfor the administration of medications.Antiemetics Most vomiting patients are treated symptomati-cally by relieving the nausea and vomiting.However, this may not be possible if the under-lying cause is metabolic or neurologic; thesecases require treatment of the underlying diseaseto treat the vomiting. There are several types of medications used to alleviate vomiting (Table 39.2). If the vomiting is Agent Route of administration Indications Side effects Meclizine 25-50 mg PO Labyrinthitis, motion Sedation. every 6 hours. sickness, vestibular causes. Diphenhydramine 25-50 mg (or 5 mg/kg/day divided hours for peds) PO/IM/IV every 4-6 hours. Scopolamine 1.5 disc transdermal every 3 days.

Most vomiting may be relieved by a single dose of prochlorperazine or promethazine, com-monly used agents to treat vomiting of unknownetiology. The newer 5-HT 3antagonists such as ondansetron, dolasetron, are par-ticularly effective at reducing chemotherapy-associated or refractory nausea and vomiting. The primary side effect of all antiemetics is sedation. Therefore, the patient must have aride home and be cautioned not to drive for the following day or when taking the medication (ifdischarged with a prescription). Possible sideeffects of the phenothiazine antiemetics andmetoclopramide are akathisia and dystonia.Akathisia is a condition of restlessness that caninclude nervousness, anxiety, and a feeling thatone's skin is \"crawling.\" This can be treated withdiphenhydramine or a benzodiazepine. A dys-tonic reaction can be far more serious, and mayinclude rhythmic contractions of the neck andback as well as repetitive protrusion of the tongue.Adystonic reaction requires treatment with diphenhydramine or benztropine for 48 hoursand possible hospital admission if severe. No further doses of antiemetics that may cause dys-tonia should be given. Special patients Pediatric Vomiting can represent a benign, self-limited ill- ness or a severe underlying illness in a child. Ahistory of bilious vomiting in a young child is an ominous finding and suggests malrotation ofthe gut or intussusception until proven other-wise. Causes of vomiting in infants and childreninclude infectious (acute gastroenteritis, otitismedia, pneumonia), metabolic (diabetic ketoaci-dosis), mechanical (obstruction), and neurogenic(increased intracranial pressure). The most com-mon cause of vomiting in an older child or ado-lescent is infectious gastroenteritis. Evaluation ofa child's hydration status is particularly important.Vital signs may be normal despite significant dehydration; dry mucus membranes, decreasedurine output and mental status changes may bemore indicative of dehydration. Moderate tosevere dehydration should be treated with an ini- tial IV normal saline bolus of 20 ml/kg. If vomitinghas been protracted, a bedside glucose shouldalso be obtained as part of the initial evaluation.Further evaluation and treatment is aimed atdetermining if a serious underlying cause of vom-iting is present. Elderly The general evaluation and treatment principlesfor vomiting also apply to the geriatric population.The response of geriatric patients to dehydrationmay be blunted by their chronic illnesses or med-ications; vital signs may not demonstrate hypoten-sion or tachycardia despite severe dehydration. Inthe elderly, a serious cause of vomiting is foundmore frequently than in younger adult popula-tions. The laboratory evaluation and diagnosticwork-up is typically more extensive, as the causeof vomiting in this population is rarely benign.Attention to the ABCs remains critical in this pop-ulation. Aggressive rehydration may be compli-cated by underlying illness and cardiac disease. Pregnant Pregnant patients commonly present to the ED with significant nausea and vomiting (some-times referred to as \"morning sickness\"). Thesepatients should be aggressively hydrated, as theyare at increased risk of miscarriage if they arevolume-depleted. Antiemetics should be selectedwith pregnancy risk categories in mind. Despitethe Class C classification for many of these agents,physicians commonly use them in the treatmentof pregnant women who need relief from vomiting.Close follow-up with the patient's obstetrician isessential. Disposition Amajority of patients will not have their cause of vomiting diagnosed in the ED, and will only receive symptomatic therapy. Admission All patients with life-threatening causes of vom-iting or serious illness related to the vomitingshould be admitted to the hospital. Consultation Consultation of a specialist will depend on theunderlying etiology of the vomiting.Primary Complaints 579VomitingDischarge In order to assure continued hydration, the patient's ability to keep down a small amount offluid (water) without vomiting should be assessedprior to discharge. This is known as a \"PO chal-lenge.\" If the patient receives adequate IV hydra-tion in the ED, an oral fluid challenge is notessential for the final disposition. Occasionally,patients without serious causes of vomiting whohave received IV fluids and feel better may gohome despite being unable to tolerate PO fluids.Most patients with simple vomiting due to abenign etiology and without signs of significantdehydration or metabolic derangement may bedischarged home provided liquids are toleratedin the ED and follow-up can be assured. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Pearls Patients may confuse coughing or spitting upphlegm with true vomiting. The history andphysical examination usually help determine thecause of the vomiting. Although the etiology of vomiting is not always identified in the ED,therapy should not be withheld. Pitfalls Regardless of the cause of the vomiting, the evaluation of these patients should focus on theABCs. Resuscitation of the markedly dehydratedindividual, regardless of the etiology of vomiting,needs to be addressed in an urgent fashion.Treatment of life-threatening etiologies must often be initiated prior to establishing a firm diagnosis.

What symptoms are the patient and/or hisor her family trying to convey? On the one hand, the patient may be com- plaining of a sensation of global lack of energy,extreme fatigue, lightheadedness, or simply feel-ing \"ill.\" In this regard, the differ ential diagnosis extends from fairly benign etiologies (mild dehy- dration, viral syndrome, hypothyroidism, (AMI), sepsis, pericardial ef fusion with tamponade). Other clues may be present to help make the correct diagnosis, but the isolated com-plaint of \"weakness\" may be associated with anyof these pathologies in isolation or combination,or a myriad of other possible etiologies. On the other hand, the patient may present complaining of a specific distribution of weak-ness associated with a true impairment of motorfunction. Patients with the chief complaint ofmotor weakness present in a number of differentways. They may present with hemiparesis(weakness of one side of the body without com-plete paralysis) or hemiplegia (complete paraly-sis of one side of the body) indicating probablevascular occlusion in a cervicocerebral arterialdistribution and ongoing ischemic stroke or tran-sient ischemic attack (TIA). Patients may alsopresent with a pattern of symmetric ascendingparesis or paralysis (Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome(GBS)), focal peripheral motor weakness (carpaltunnel syndrome), symmetric proximal muscleweakness (polymyositis), weakness in ptosis(myasthenia gravis (MG), botulism), or even acombination of the above findings (multiple scle-rosis (MS)). This chapter focuses primarily on the patient presenting with the complaint of weakness asso-ciated with true objective impairment of motorfunction. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and TIAare discussed in detail, as these are the mostimportant disease processes causing motor weak- ness that the emergency physicians encounter. The importance of acute stroke cannot be over-emphasized, as this disease alone accounts forapproximately 1 million hospitalizations per yearin the US, and it is the third leading cause of deathand the number one cause of adult disability inthis country. The emergency physician must alsobe prepared to identify and manage otherselected etiologies of motor weakness. Anatomic essentials Accurate diagnosis and effective treatment plan-ning for the patient with motor weakness hingesupon the emergency physician's ability to iden-tify the underlying lesion(s) responsible for thepatient's disability. First, physicians must deter-mine whether the patient's weakness arises froma central nervous system (CNS) or peripheralnervous system (PNS) problem, or in the musclesthemselves. Central nervous system CNS disturbances result in a constellation ofsigns and symptoms due to the specific under-lying lesion(s) present. Most often, acute weaknesscaused by a lesion in the CNS is anacute cervicocerebral parenchyma oxygenated blood. When examining cerebralblood flow, the vascular distributions may bedivided into the anterior circulation (carotidartery distribution) and the posterior circulation(vertebrobasilar distribution). In the anterior cir-culation, the carotid terminus divides into theanterior cerebral artery (ACA) and the middlecerebral artery (MCA). Occlusions of the ACAcause sudden onset of contralateral upper andlower extremity weakness and numbness, withthe lower extremity being affected greater than theupper extremity. There may also be associated gaitapraxia (clumsiness), incontinence, and slowed mentation (Table 40.1). Occlusions of the MCAresult in the acute onset of contralateral upper40 Weakness R.

A contralateral facial droop is usually present with hemiparesis of the extremities. Contralateral hom onymous hemi- anopsia (visual field disturbance) is also oftenpresent, and conjugate gaze may be affected withthe eyes pointing towards the side of the lesion.Depending on which cerebral hemisphere isaffected, further deficits also occur. If the dom-inant hemisphere (usually the left brain) isdeprived of blood flow, aphasia is commonlypresent. The aphasia may be expressive (the patient knows what he wants to say but cannotget the words out), receptive (the patient cannot understand what is being communicated to them),or global (both expressive and receptive aphasia present). If the nondominant hemisphere isaffected (usually the right brain), hemineglect(the patient unconsciously ignores the affectedside of the body) may be present (Table 40.1). Vertebrobasilar arterial occlusions result in a constellation of symptoms that may includeipsilateral cerebellar dysfunction (severe vertigo,nausea and dys-functions, and and/or hemisensorydeficits. The variety of findings observed by theemergency physician depends on the specificarterial distribution affected. Table 40.1 includesdescriptions of various uncommon stroke/TIAsyndromes resulting from posterior cerebrovas-cular occlusions. CNS by inflam- matory or demyelinating disorders. Demyelinat-ingdisorders may cause a confusing variety of signs and symptoms, such as the combination ofunilateral visual disturbance and variable motorweakness seen in patients with MS. Peripheral nervous system PNS dysfunction may cause motor weakness as aresult of pathophysiologic processes involving the neuromuscular junction or the peripheral nervesthemselves. Disruption of neuromuscular junc-tion causes motor weakness by inhibiting thenormal physiology of motor end plate stimula-tion to facilitate muscle contraction. This may bethe result of a toxin-mediated process (botulism)or abnormal antibodies attacking the motor endplate (MG). Dysfunction of the neuromuscularjunction also occurs iatrogenically with the use ofdrugs that act at the neuromuscular junc tion(succinylcholine, vecuronium). Peripheral nerve malfunction that impairs motor strength mayresult from direct damage to peripheral nerves toxins arsenic Primary muscle dysfunction Primary muscle dysfunction resulting in motorweakness may be caused by an inflammatorymyopathy (polymyositis, dermatomyositis) orabnormalities in ion channels found in skeletalmuscles (hypokalemic periodic paralysis). History Obtaining an accurate and complete history canbe quite challenging in the patient presentingwith acute weakness. Many patients have diffi-culty pinpointing the exact timing of their weak-ness. In addition, some stroke and TIA patientssuffer an accompanying aphasia and are unableto relay their history. With nondominant hemi-spheric strokes and TIAs, the patient may be com-pletely unaware that a large neurologic deficit even exists. The use of family or bystanders iscritical to the emergency physician's ability toprocure a thorough history. What is the distribution of motor weakness? The distribution of motor weakness corresponds to the underlying anatomical lesion(s) present. Hemiparesis is indicative of str oke, TIA, or pos- sible mimics. Isolated extremity weakness likelythe result radicular or periph-eral neuropathy, or peripheral vascular occlu-sion. When bilateral weakness is encountered,further historical points must be explored. GBS is associated with a symmetric ascending paralysisinitially involving the lower extremities, then progressing in a cephalad direction. Motor weak-ness encompass ing both cranial and peripheral nerve distributions is likely the result of inflam- matory (MS), toxic/metabolic (botulism), orautoimmune processes (MG). When bilateral weakness is associated with a discrete sensory level (below which the patient has loss of sensa- tion) and/or bladder dysfunction, a lesion in the spinal cord is suspected. Bilateral weakness thataffects the proximal musculature to a greaterdegree than is indicative of myopathy (polymyositis, dermatomyositis). Inthese patients, difficulty ascending stairs, risingfrom a chair, or problems with personal groom-ing commonly arise. Was the onset of weakness sudden or gradual? The sudden onset of motor weakness implies a vaso-occlusive etiology. Ischemic strokes andTIAs are the result of thrombotic or embolicocclusion of a cervicocerebral artery, and in gen-eral occur with sudden onset. This may be diffi-cult for the patient to identify, as they may beunaware of the symptoms. In addition, thepatient may have been asleep when the stroke orTIA began, making the determination of onsetimpossible. The sudden onset of extremity weak-ness caused by the abrupt occlusion of a majorartery supplying that extremity will likely beaccompanied by paresthesias, pain, pallor, andpulselessness. Patients presenting with the gradual onset of progressive motor weakness probably sufferfrom a nonvascular pathophysiologic process.Subacute motor weakness is more likely associ-ated with inflammatory disorders of the nervoussystem or toxic/meta-bolic pr ocesses (botulism, hypokalemic periodic paralysis). Were there any significant events surrounding the onset of weakness? Many stroke mimics are associated with easily identifiable conditions that accompany the onsetof weakness. Seizures preceding the onset ofweakness may imply postictal (Todd's) paralysis.Ongoing migraine headache in a young femaleassociated with motor weakness might indicate acomplicated migraine. Severe sudden headachewith motor weakness should alarm the examinerof a possible subarachnoid hemorrhage. Weak-ness in the setting of trauma could indicate a sub-dural or epidural hematoma. Severe migratorychest or neck pain accompanying motor weaknessshould alert the physician to the possibility ofarterial dissection syndromes.Is there a temporal pattern to the weakness? Patients who complain of weakness worsening with repetitive motions may be exhibiting symp-toms of neuromuscular junction pathology (suchas MG). These patients may report difficulty withblinking, chewing, typing, or other motor tasksrequiring frequent repeated movements. Increased clinical suspicion for dyskalemic periodic para-lysis occurs when the patient complains of sud-den episodic resolving motor weakness. When did the weakness begin? Emergent stroke therapy is extremely time- dependent. The option of intravenous (IV) throm-bolytic therapy for AIS is available only within astrict (and brief) time window of 3 hours fromsymptom onset. It is therefore critical that theemergency physician extract from the patient orwitnesses the exact time of symptom onset. Associated symptoms Headache Ischemic stroke and TIA are not usually associ- ated with severe headache initially. Acute motorweakness accompanied by a significant head-ache is worrisome for subarachnoid vascular stroke, the evaluatingphysician must consider the possibility ofincreased intracranial pressure. Stroke a migraine-type headachemay indicate complicated migraine, classically adisease of young adult females. Visual changes Double vision (diplopia) of acute onset may be associated with a posterior circulation stroke. In isolation, this complaint usually implies aprocess affecting the neuromuscular junction.Monocular visual complaints may be exhibitedwith optic neuritis of new-onset MS. Nausea and vomiting The presence of nausea and vomiting may also be a warning sign of increased intracranial pressure.Careful evaluation for intracranial lesions andcerebral edema is warranted. Severe vomiting Weakness 584 Primary ComplaintsPrimary Complaints 585Weaknessand/or diarrhea may predispose the patient to electrolyte imbalances leading to motor weakness. Chest or neck pain The presence of ongoing migratory chest or neck pain may indicate the presence of an acute arter-ial dissection (thoracic aorta or carotid/vertebralartery dissection). Appropriate radiologic studiesshould be emergently executed when arterialdissection is suspected. AMI may also be associ- ated with AIS. Abdominal and/or back pain Abdominal and/or back pain accompanied by lower extremity weakness could signify dissec-tion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)with concomitant spinal cord Backpain with weaknessmay indicate herniated lumbar disk with nerveroot impingement. Back pain with bilateral lower extremity weakness, sensory level, and priapismin the setting of significant trauma is worrisomefor spinal cord injury. Similar symptoms withouta history of trauma should alert the physician tothe possibility of acute cauda equina syndrome,primary spinal cord lesions, or compressivespinal cord lesions such as epidural hematoma orabscess. Musculoskeletal pain and tenderness Musculoskeletal pain and diffuse muscular tenderness associated with motor weakness(especially proximal weakness) is suggestive ofmyopathy (polymyositis, dermatomyositis).Severe muscular pain coupled with dark urine oroliguria and motor weakness may indicate acuterhabdomyolysis. Rash The complaint of rash, particularly in the perior- bital region, is associated with dermatomyositis. Past medical When eliciting a patient's history in the setting ofacute motor weakness, the emergency physicianmust focus on identifying risk factors for the sus-pected etiology of weakness. When AIS or TIA issuspected, the physician should inquire aboutrisk factors (Table 40.2). A recent history of viralillness accompanied by the acute onset ofascending bilateral motor weakness is classic forGBS. Occupational exposures to heavy metal toxins (arsenic poisoning) or to repetitive handmotions, such as hammering or typing (carpaltunnel syndrome) may provide clues to the diag-nosis. Social history should include questionsabout possible cocaine use in the setting ofstroke, suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage, orTIA. Heavy alcohol use accompanies alcohol-induced myopathies. Family history may be pos-itive for familial causes of weakness (hypokalemicperiodic paralysis). Acomplete list of the patient's current medi- cations should be carefully reviewed. The use ofcorticosteroid therapy as well as some lipid-lowering agents may induce drug-related myopa-thy.Although not usually a cause of true motor weakness, medication use in the elderly is com-monly attributed to the subjective complaints ofweakness and dizziness. Physical examination The primary aim of the physical examination isto both localize and quantify the extent of neuro-logic deficit(s) present. The distribution andextent of weakness often lend important clues tothe underlying lesion(s) and aid in the diagnosisand management of the patient. General appearance As with all ED patients, global assessment of theairway, breathing, and circulation takes first pri-ority. Fortunately, most patients presenting withmotor weakness do not have major issues inthese areas. Exceptions are patients sufferingfrom large intracranial hemorrhage who mayneed immediate airway assistance. Patients with advanced GBS may have extremely poorrespiratory effort secondary to paralysis of theirHistory of transient Old age ischemic attack African-American race History of stroke Hypertension Cigarette smoking Diabetes mellitusAtrial fibrillation Coronary artery diseaseHyperlipidemia Male genderCarotid stenosisTable 40.2 Risk for acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attackbreathing musculature, and may need emergent mechanical ventilation. Trauma patients withspinal cord injuries may suffer spinal shock andrequire interventions to correct circulatory col- lapse. Vital signs As a general rule, most patients presenting withacute motor weakness will not exhibit major vitalsign abnormalities. Patients with AIS often pres-ent with elevated blood pressure (BP), as under-lying uncontrolled hypertension is very commonamong stroke victims. Wide fluctuations in BPand heart rate may reflect autonomic instabilityassociated with GBS. The presence of fever maysuggest an infectious etiology associated withacute motor weakness (epidural abscess), or maycontribute to the precipitation of motor weak-ness with underlying disease (MG).

Cardiopulmonary The heart is auscultated to evaluate rhythm andto detect murmurs. An irregularly irregularrhythm is present with atrial fibrillation, an important risk factor for embolic stroke. Thepresence of a murmur alerts the examiner of the possibility of valvular heart disease and thepotential for emboli. Extremities Unequal pulses may be present in acute arterialdissection syndromes, which may cause acutemotor weakness secondary to distal ischemia toeither a limb or the CNS. Skin The presence of a periorbital violaceous rashmay be present with dermatomyositis. Carefulexamination for the presence of a tick should takeplace in the at-risk patient with motor weakness. Neurologic Acareful and thorough neurologic examination is of critical importance in the evaluation of thepatient with acute motor weakness. The essentialneurologic examination consists of six majorareas: mental status, CNs, motor function, sens-ory function, deep tendon reflexes, and cerebel-lar function. Mental status First the examiner performs an overall assessment of the patient's level of awareness. Level of con-sciousness and degree of orientation to person,place, time, and situation are assessed. Concurrentwith the mental status examination, the emer-gency physician learns of any deficiencies ofspeech that may be present. Dysarthria (slurredspeech) is readily detected, as are more profoundlanguage deficits, such as receptive aphasia (thepatient cannot understand what is being said) orexpressive aphasia (the patient cannot get his orher words out). Cranial nerves Aquick, systematic assessment of CN func- tion follows the mental status examination. The emergency physician tests for visual field deficitsby confrontation (examiner faces the patient andslowly brings moving fingers in from the sidesuntil the patient detects them), examines pupil-lary light reflexes, then tests all extraocularmovements (CN II, III, IV , VI). The examiner hasthe patient smile and looks for facial palsy(droop), and also tests facial sensation (CN V ,VII). Testing swallowing and symmetrical palaterise (CN IX, X), shoulder shrugging (CN XI), tongue protrudesfrom the mouth (CN XII) completes the CNexamination. Motor function The strength examination assesses strength in all four extremities. Marked strength deficits may bedetected on examination and are graded accordingto a 5-point scale (Table 40.3). Subtle strengthdeficits may be more difficult to elicit. Evaluationfor the presence of pronator drift may be helpful to Weakness 586 Primary ComplaintsWeakness detect very mild strength deficits of the proximal upper extremities. The examiner has the patienthold both arms out 90\u00b0 with palms up and eyesclosed and watches for slight pronation of eitherforearm. An overall assessment of function is also help- ful to the examiner. Subtle deficiencies of motorstrength may be identified with somewhat moredifficult motor tasks, such as tiptoe walking, heel walking, or rapid alternating movements.Difficulty rising from a chair or stool or withbrushing hair may identify proximal muscleweakness associated with myopathies. Fatigabilityof a particular motor function (with initially normal strength) points to a disturbance at the neuromuscular junction (MG). Sensory function The sensory examination is arguably the least important component of the emergency neuro-logic examination; therefore, the examiner neednot spend an inordinate amount of time testingsensation. A brief assessment of fine touch suf-fices in the emergent setting. If deficits aredetected, more time may be taken to delineateexact distributions of sensory disturbances. Iftime allows, assessment of vibratory sensation,2-point discrimination, and sharp/dull discrimi-nation may be performed but is usually notessential in the emergent setting. Reflexes The emergency physician's assessment of deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) should include reflextesting in both upper and lower extremities.Reflexes are graded on a 0-4 point scale (Table40.4). Absence of lower extremity reflexes in thesetting of acute bilateral lower extremity weak-ness is a hallmark of GBS. Peripheral reflexes of aparticular myotome may be diminished orabsent in a peripheral neuropathy radiculopa-thy compression syndrome. Asymmetric hyper-reflexia and/or clonus (extreme hyperreflexia with the presence of repetitive contraction of amuscle group) may be seen with CNS lesions.Babinski's sign (dorsiflexion of the great toe and fanning of the other toes when the plantar aspectof the foot is stroked) may be present in CNSlesions as well. Cerebellar function Finally, the emergency physician should exam- ine the patient for cerebellar dysfunction.Coordination tests such as finger-to-nose coord-ination and heel-to-shin coordination are per-formed. In the able patient, standard gait isassessed along with heel-to-toe walking.Difficulty in coordination may be quite apparenton examination of rapid alternating movements(dysdiadochokinesia). The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) In the AIS patient, an adjunct to the standard neurologic examination may be used. TheNational Institutes of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS) is a 42-point scale which focuses on andgrades level of consciousness, visual function,motor function, sensation and neglect, language,and cerebellar integrity (Table 40.5). It thereforeclosely mirrors the standard neurologic examina-tion already discussed. As can be seen from thescale, the higher the score, the worse the neuro-logic deficit associated with ongoing stroke. TheNIHSS can provide insight into the location andseverity of underlying ischemic stroke, and hasbeen shown to be a strong initial predictor ofoverall clinical outcome. Perhaps most impor-tant, its use provides emergency physicians apowerful and accurate means of communicationwith the stroke team or neurology consultants.

Hypoglycemia must beconsidered immediately in all patients present-ing with acute motor weakness. It should bequickly identified and treated with IV dextrose.Treatment of hypoglycemia usually results in the immediate resolution of neurologic deficits ifhypoglycemia is the cause. Complete blood count Acomplete blood count (CBC) is useful for screening for polycythemia-induced hypervis- cosity. In addition, the CBC is used to thrombocytopenia (an risk for TIA/ AIS. Electrolyte panel Electrolyte and renal function panels are import- ant for identifying uncommon stroke mimicssuch as uremia and hyponatremia . Calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels should alsobe routinely the patient with acutemotor weakness. Dyskalemic syndromes (mostcommonly hypokalemic periodic paralysis) maybe identified on an electrolyte panel, althoughserum potassium may be normal. Coagulation studies Coagulation studies including International Normalized Ratio (INR) are important in patientstaking warfarin, and must be known prior to ini-tiation ombolytic or such aspolymyositis and dermatomyositis. CK levelsshould be measured in all patients with diffusemotor weakness, especially when proximal mus-cle weakness or muscle tenderness is present.Cardiac enzymes Not uncommonly, AMI occurs concomitantly with AIS and TIA. Embolic strokes may occur asa result of clots arising from the heart, as focalmyocardial hypokinesis gives rise to local stasisand clot formation. All AIS patients should therefore be screened for ongoing myocardialinfarction. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a non- specific marker for inflammatory processes. Itmay also be elevated in the presence of neoplasm.An elevated ESR may be seen in many disorderscausing acute motor weakness, includingpolymyositis, dermatomyositis, or Lambert-Eatonsyndrome (LES). Cerebrospinal fluid studies Abnormalities in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies may be used to aid in the diagnosis of some etiolo-gies of acute motor weakness. Markedly elevatedCSF protein levels are often detected with GBS.CSF in patients with MS may demonstrate oligo-clonal bands in the gamma-globulin region.Patients with transverse myelitis have CSF abnor-malities elevated whiteblood cell (WBC) count ( /H1102250-100/hpf) along with elevated protein. Heavy metals Heavy metal levels are generally not helpful in the acute setting, as most results are not rapidlyavailable to emergency physicians. Therefore,diagnosis of toxicity must be based largely onclinical suspicion. Diagnosis is confirmed withelevated serum levels of the causative agents(i.e., arsenic, lead). Electrocardiogram An electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiacenzyme studies are used to search for concurrentcardiac ischemia. An ECG is also important for theidentification of dysrhythmias, espe-cially atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, which pre-dispose a patient to stroke or TIA. Imbalances ofcalcium, magnesium, and potassium may bedetected on an ECG before laboratory values areobtainable.Weakness 596 studies Head computed tomography Emergent computed tomography (CT) of the head is by far the most important radiographicstudy in the evaluation of a patient with AIS. Asthrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke isextremely time-dependent, rapid CT scanning ofthe head is the highest priority. All efforts shouldbe made towards getting the patient to the scan-ner and having the CT interpreted as quickly aspossible. Thr ombolytic therapy treatment algo- rithms hinge on the presence or absence of intracranial blood on head CT, and this criticaldetermination must be made within 3 hours ofonset of the patient's symptoms. Emergent headCT also helps to rule out nonvascular lesions ofthe brain (neoplasm, subdural hematoma),which may present similarly to stroke or TIA. In patients presenting with AIS beyond throm- bolytic therapeutic time windows, CT scanningof the head remains a useful screening tool fornonvascular lesions, and also helps delineate theanatomical distribution and extent of the stroke.Vasogenic edema or mass effect associated with large ischemic strokes may be seen on head CTand help identify patients at risk for dangerousrises in intracranial pressure. CT scanning is of little use in patients present- ing with generalized weakness. When patientspresent with signs and symptoms of peripheralneuropathy or radiculopathy, head CT can beavoided. CT angiography may play an important role in the future of emergent stroke management,but at present remains under investigation. Carotid duplex scanning Carotid duplex scanning does not have an impor- tant role in the emergent diagnostic work-up ofAIS. However, carotid studies may be extremelyvaluable in the emergent work-up of TIA byidentifying patients with significant carotid steno-sisamenable to surgical carotid endarterectomy. Since current literature demonstrates that patientswith TIA are at great immediate risk for AIS(approximately 10.5% stroke risk at 90 days, 5.3%within 48 hours), it is essential to identify thoseat greatest risk and those for whom interventionmay prevent future str oke. The recommendation of these authors is that carotid duplex studies be performed on all patients presenting with ante-rior circulation (carotid distribution) TIA beforedischarge from the hospital.Echocardiography Echocardiography is useful to identify cardiac thrombi as a potential origin of embolic cerebralischemic events. All patients with ischemicstroke or TIA and evidence of cardiac dysrhyth-mia (e.g., atrial fibrillation) or cardiac ischemiashould undergo echocardiography as a part oftheir work-up. Magnetic resonance imaging or angiography Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has limited utility in the emergent evaluation of AIS.Availability of emergent MRI is limited at most institutions, and the test is very time-consuming.MRI or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)is very useful in the evaluation of acute TIA.Subtle changes not identified on CT scanningmay be discovered, and MRA adds sensitivity tocarotid duplex studies to identify carotid lesions.MRA is essential in the evaluation of posteriorcirculation TIA, and is the preferred method toevaluate the vertebrobasilar circulation. Newermodalities such as diffusion-weighted MRI areunder investigation and may play a greater rolein the future evaluation of AIS and TIA. MRI is of great value in patients presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with acutemyelopathy. Acute cord compression syndromesrelated to epidural abscess, lesion, or herniated vertebral disk are read-ily identified on spinal MRI. Spinal cord edemaresulting from acute transverse myelitis may also be identified with MRI scanning. MRI of the brain is useful in the diagnosis of MS. On T2-weighted imaging, discrete whitematter lesions (plaques) are visible in greaterthan 85% of patients with MS. Other studies Tensilon test The tensilon test is specifically used in makingthe diagnosis of MG. To perform this test, thephysician administers 1-2 mg of edrophonium (a short-acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) IVand watches for signs of improvement in thepatient's weakness. The onset of action ofedrophonium is about 30 seconds and its effectslast about 5 minutes. If no change or problemsare observed, an additional 8 mg is infused (maybe given in 4 mg increments). For patients inmyasthenic crisis, this maneuver results inincreased amounts of acetylcholine (Ach) at thePrimary Complaints 597Weaknessneuromuscular junction and results in improve- ment in motor function. Caution must be usedwith the tensilon test, as significantly increasedamounts of in lacrimation). Atropine may be used to reverse toxicity. In patients with MG whoare already on cholinesterase inhibitor therapy,even greater caution must be used as these patientsmay present with weakness resulting from under-lying medication-induced cholinergic crisis. Pulmonary function testing Though not commonly utilized by emergency physicians, bedside pulmonary function testing(forced vital capacity (FVC), negative inspiratoryforce (NIF)) may be useful in the patient withmotor weakness contributing to marked respira-tory difficulty. In the patient with severe GBS orMG, progressive respiratory failure may requireemergent mechanical ventilation. The decision ofwhether to intubate the patient may be difficult, asthese patients are usually able to compensate wellwith tachypnea and accessory musculature use. The use of routine measures of respiratory function such as pulse oximetry and arterialblood gases generally does not render an accu-rate picture of the degree of respiratory failure inthese patients. By the time a drop in pulse oxime-try and rise in PCO 2are detected, the patient may be well beyond the need for mechanical assis-tance. The need for mechanical intervention maybe identified earlier with the measurement ofFVC and NIF by a respiratory therapist. Generally,an FVC below 10 ml/kg or NIF below 20 cmH 2O indicates the need for emergent mechanical ventilation. Swallowing studies Aspiration pneumonia is a major contributor to the morbidity and mortality of stroke patients.All patients with AIS/TIA should undergo formal swallowing evaluation before oral intakeof any kind is allowed. General treatment principles Airway, breathing, circulation (ABCs) In general, most patients presenting to the ED with AIS or TIA do not have problems with airway,breathing, or circulatory status. Exceptions arise in patients who present 2-5 days after a largeischemic stroke, when ischemia-related cerebraledema begins to exert mass effect. Acute ischemic stroke Oxygen No benefit has been observed with the routine administration of oxygen to patients with AIS.Conversely, some evidence exists which suggeststhat supranormal oxygenation may worsen out-come. Therefore, supplemental oxygen should bereserved for patients with hypoxia in the setting of AIS. Hyperthermia Hyperthermia should be treated in all stroke patients, as elevated core temperature is known tobe harmful in the setting of AIS. Conversely, thereare studies that have demonstrated a decrease ininfarct size with lower core temperatures. Thepresence of fever in the setting of stroke shouldprompt emergency physicians to consider andinvestigate concurrent infectious conditions. Glucose control Hypoglycemia in the setting of acute motor weakness requires immediate treatment with IVdextrose, which usually resolves ongoing symp-toms rapidly. Some studies have found thathyperglycemia may worsen overall stroke out-come by aggravating ongoing neuronal ischemia.Therefore, serum glucose levels greater than300 mg/dl should be treated with insulin. Hypertension The management of hypertension in the setting of AIS is somewhat controversial. There is generalagreement that elevated BPs should not beaggressively lowered in patients with ongoingAIS or TIA. Many stroke/TIA patients have under-lying chronic hypertension and limited autoregu-latory capabilities of cerebral circulation. Inischemic situations, the acute lowering of BP maydecrease cerebral perfusion and collateral circula-tion further, leading to infarct extension andacceleration of neuronal injury. Special situations such as ongoing AMI, hypertensive encephalopathy, aortic dissection,congestive heart failure, acute renal failure, andWeakness 598 Primary Complaintsthrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke may be present and call for careful hypertensive controlin the setting of stroke. In these situations, easilytitratable pharmacologic agents are preferred(Table 40.8), and medications that precipitouslydrop BP should be avoided. The management ofhypertension in candidates for thrombolytic ther-apy is quite different from these other conditions. Aspirin The role of antiplatelet medications in the treat- ment of AIS remains under debate. In the largeInternational Stroke Trial, aspirin treatment pro-vided no significant benefit with regard to death ordisability at 2 week or 6 month outcome measures.However, in the same trial there was significantreduction in the recurrence rate of ischemic stroke. Based on this finding and other data, it is currentlyrecommended that aspirin therapy following AIS begin within 48 hours of stroke onset to help pre-vent recurrent ischemic stroke. Aspirin use before the administration of throm- bolytics is not a contraindication to thrombolytictherapy; etical increase in risk precludes the routine use of aspirinin thrombolytic candidates. Aspirin is held for 24hours following the administration of throm-bolytic therapy before being added back to thepatient's daily regimen (50-325 mg). Oral aspirinshould be withheld to avoid aspiration until for-mal swallowing evaluation is completed.Anticoagulation The use of unfractionated and low- molecular weight heparins (LMWH) for the initial manage- ment of AIS is somewhat controversial. The cur- rent literature, most notably the International Stroke Trial, does not support the administrationof unfractionated heparins, as no published datademonstrate sustained improved in clinical out-come for ischemic stroke with their use. LMWH has been studied as well; similarly, there has been no sustained improved clinicaloutcome for AIS to date with the use of LMWH.Many clinical trials have shown a significantdecrease in the incidence of deep venous throm-bosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) fol-lowing AIS with the use of LMWH, and its useshould be considered for thromboembolic com-plications of bedridden stroke victims. Thrombolytics BackgroundAdiscussion of thrombolytic therapy for AIS is incomplete without mention of the landmark study that propelled IV tissue plasminogen activa-tor (t-PA) into the stroke care provider's arma-men tarium. In 1995, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) StudyGroup published the results of the NINDS trial oft-PA for AIS .Using recombinant t-PA (rt-PA) under a specific set of guidelines, the NINDS investiga-tors demonstrated a significant improvement inclinical outcome at 3 months for patients with AIS. The NINDS trial consisted of two major parts. Part I enrolled 291 patients and appraised theefficacy of rt-PA based on a 4-point improvementin NIHSS score or complete resolution of neuro-logic deficit at 24 hours following treatment.Although Part I did not demonstrate significantimprovement in 24 hours, there was a statistic-ally significant benefit found at 3 months for thetreatment group in four separate outcome meas-ures (NIHSS, modified Rankin scale, Glasgowoutcome scale, and Barthel Index). Part II of theNINDS trial followed, enrolling 333 patients andconfirming significant clinical improvement at 3months for AIS patients found in Part I. In a laterpublication, the significant improvement in clin-ical outcome was sustained at 1-year follow-up.Overall, AIS patients treated with rt-PA withinthe strict parameters of the NINDS trial werefound to be 30% more likely to have minimal orno disability compared to the placebo group at 3 months and 1 year outcome measures. Table 40.8 Pharmacologic agents recommended for BP control in over 1-2 minutes. May MAP /H11022130 mmHg repeat or double every 10 minutes to maximumdose of 150 mg.Enalapril 1.25 mg IV push may also be used SBP /H11021220 Antihypertensive therapy DBP /H11088120 or indicated most feared complication of thrombolytic therapy for stroke is symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. In trial, the incidence (ICH)occurred ten-fold times in the treatmentgroup compared to placebo (6.4% vs. 0.6%).However, there was no significance difference inmortality at 3 months between the treatment andplacebo groups in the trial (17% and 21%, respec-tively) and no increase in the severely disabledgroup was observed. Since 1996 there have been other trials in the US and Canada that have attempted to repro-duce the results of the NINDS trial. Researchcontinues to further determine the optimal phar-macotherapy for AIS. At present, there remainsonly one therapy approved by the FDA. Basedon the available data, the treatment of AIS withthrombolytic therapy carries the Grade A recom-menda tion of the Stroke Council of the American Heart Association and currently provides the besthope for an improved outcome for stroke patients. Administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke Having made the diagnosis of AIS, the emer- gency physician should consider thrombolytictherapy with the help of neurology or stroketeam consultants. The therapeutic window for IVt-PA lies within 3 hours from stroke symptomonset. This window must be strictly adhered to in order to optimize outcome and minimize theincidence of ICH. The inclusion and exclusioncriteria for thrombolytic therapy are reviewed(Table 40.9). Extensive discussion with the patientand family must take place to provide all avail-able information necessary to make an informeddecision. Primarily, this conversation revolvesaround the potential benefits the patient mayhave with thrombolytic therapy, as well as therisks the patient will be exposed to by thrombo-lytic administration. After these discussions takeplace and the individual risk/benefit profile ofthe patient is assessed, the decision whether totreat with thrombolytic therapy is made. The dose of IV t-PA for AIS is 0.9 mg/kg (90 mg maximumdose) with 10% of total dose given IV over 1-2minutes and the remaining 90% infused over 1hour. T-PAmay also be given intra-arterially (IA t-PA) at the site of the vaso-occlusive clot by skilledinterventional neuroradiologists in specializedcenters with this capability. The therapeutic window for IA t-PA extends out to 6 hours following ischemic stroke onset according to pre-sent research. If this therapy is available either inthe treating emergency physician's institution ora nearby referral center, IA t-PA should be care-fully considered as possible therapy for AIS. Management of hypertension in thrombolytic candidates requires special attention, as uncon-trolled hypertension is a contraindication tothrombolytic therapy. Before treatment with t-PAcan be considered, the pretreatment BP must begently lowered to a systolic pressure less than185 mmHg and a diastolic pressure less than110mmHg. Recommendations for the manage- ment of hypertension in the thrombolytic candi-date are based on Advanced Cardiac Life Support(ACLS) guidelines (Table 40.10). If aggressivemeans are required to hold the patient's BP withinthe accepted guidelines, consideration of throm-bolytic therapy must be aborted as uncontrolledTable 40.9 Indications and contraindications to thrombolytic therapy in acute ischemic stroke Indications Acute ischemic stroke within 3 hours from symptom onset.

Post-treatment considerations Admission to a specialized neurointensive care unit should occur as soon as possible followingthrombolytic therapy. Neurologic exams and BPmonitoring must be performed at regular inter-vals. If such monitoring is unavailable, transferto an appropriate facility should be considered. Transient ischemic attack There is no specific emergency treatment foracute TIA. Most importantly, the emergencyphysician must recognize the immediate signifi-cant risk for imminent AIS that TIA represents.Recent literature suggests that the risk of AIS fol-lowing TIA is approximately 10.5% within 3months, with about half of these ischemic strokesoccurring within the first 48 hours followingTIA. A complete work-up with neurology consult-ation and advancement of antiplatelet therapy is recommended. If the patient is already on a max- imum antiplatelet regimen (aspirin plus clopido-grel, aspirin plus dypyridamole, etc.) thenanticoagulation with warfarin is considered. ForTIA patients in whom a carotid stenosis isdiscovered on carotid duplex studies, surgicalcarotid endarterectomy should be considered. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome In patients with GBS, special attention should bepaid to identify involvement of the respiratorymuscles. Ventilatory assistance is necessary whenthe patient's FVC falls below 1 liter. Respiratoryfailure requiring mechanical ventilation occursin nearly 20% of patients with GBS. Further therapy, generally initiated on an inpatient basis, involves immunosuppressionbecause of the immune and inflammatory com-ponents of the disease. Such treatment continuesto be studied and includes plasma exchange withthe removal of ml/kg over g/kg/day for 5 days. Both plasmaexchange and IVIG should be started early, asthey have been shown to stop progression of thesymptoms and accelerate recovery. CSF filtrationis currently being studied, but remains contro-versial at this time. DVT prophylaxis is war-ranted, as thromboembolism causes significantmorbidity and mortality in patients with GBS.There is no evidence supporting the use of corti-costeroid therapy in GBS. Myasthenia gravis The emergency physician must recognize andmanage the acute deterioration of a patient withMG based on clinical findings. As with GBS,observing the patient for respiratory comprom-ise is of the utmost importance. Intu bation is usually required if FVC falls below 1 liter. If endo- tracheal intubation is necessary, depolarizingparalytic agents should be avoided. Once the airway is appropriately managed, further therapy is considered. In a known MGpatient in myasthenic crisis, reasons for the exac-erbation need to be determined and appropri-ately managed. This includes identifying andtreating any source of infection, reducing elevatedenvironmental and body temperatures, and con-trolling emotional stress. Once a patient is foundto be in myasthenic crisis with a positive tensilontest, drugs designed to increase the amount ofAch at the neuromuscular junction can be initi-ated. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the pri-mary agents used; they act to increase availableAch thereby reaching a critical threshold of acti-vated Ach receptors needed to enhance muscleactivity and improve strength. Pyridostigmine Weakness 600 Primary ComplaintsTable 40.10 Emergent antihypertensive therapies mmHg may repeat and double up to a maximum dose of 150 mg DBP: /H110032 hours, then every 30 minutes /H110036 hours, then every hour /H1100316 hours;Primary Complaints 601Weaknesscan be used at an initial dose of 60 mg every 4-6 hours per os (PO). If patient is intubated or isnulla per os (NPO), IV pyridostigmine can beused one-thirteenth dose. Neostigmine is an alternate acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and canbe administered at the dose of 0.5 mg IV or 15 mgPO. Both of these medications may causeincreased airway resistance in patients with con-comitant asthma or chronic obstructive pul-monary disease (COPD). The use of inhaledipratropium may help prevent this side effect. Ifpatients are not responding to acetylcholinesteraseinhibitors, steroids are added. However, they maytake weeks to have an effect and are not practicalin the acute setting. Other therapies availableoutside of the ED include thymectomy, plasma exchange, and IVIG. The reason for improvement in MG patients after a thymectomy is still unclear,but interestingly 75% of patients are noted tohave an abnormal thymus gland upon diagnosis. The emergency physician should also be aware that a myasthenic crisis might result fromthe use of certain drugs in treatment of other dis-eases. Medications that can precipitate a crisisshould be avoided unless they are emergentlynecessary. Cholinergic crises may be treated with incre- mental doses of atropine but should be managedconservatively if mild. Acetylcholinesterase ther-apy is temporarily discontinued. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome There is no specific treatment for LES, but the syndrome usually does not lead to respiratory orbulbar muscle failure. Multiple sclerosis In the acute care setting, effort should be directedat eliminating exacerbating conditions such feverand infectious processes. Respiratory compromiseshould be managed aggressively. An increasedrisk of aspiration is present when endotrachealintubation is required for MS patients due todecreased gastric motility. Due to vesicourethraldysfunction, MS patients are at a higher risk of urinary tract infections, especially if the post-void residual exceeds 100 ml. High-dose methyl-prednisolone and adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH) may shorten MS exacerbations. a neurologist and admissionare usually required.Acute transverse myelitis There is no proven effective treatment for inflam-matory transverse myelitis, but corticosteroidsare often administered in the acute setting toreduce inflammation. Up to one-third of patients suffering from transverse myelitis recover spon-taneously. For acute episodes resulting fromcompressive lesions, emergent surgical consulta-tion is required for immediate decompression. Polymyositis or dermatomyositis Treatment involves supportive care along with immunosuppressive therapy with steroids ormethotrexate, as well as extensive physical andoccupational therapy. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis Treatment involves supportive care and oral potas- sium replacement or IV with special attention to respiratorystatus. Gastrointestinal considered in food-borne and infantile botu-lism. Infantile botulism should generally not betreated with antibiotics, as this may lead to fur-ther lysis of Clostridium botulinum in the gut and increase the infant's toxin load. A trivalent anti-toxin is available but its use should be generallyreserved for severe cases. Botulism antitoxin is equine-derived, making acute allergic reaction andserum sickness a concern. The antitoxin shouldbe avoided in infantile botulism; human botu-lism immunoglobulin (BIG) is available. Heavy metals Treatment is withheld until definitive diagnosis is established. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)and dimercaprol (BAL) are heavy metal chelatorsused in arsenic poisoning. BAL chelation is thepreferred therapy for acute poisoning and isgiven intramuscularly at the dose of 3-5 mg/kgevery 4 hours initially. DMSA (10 mg/kg) may begiven orally every 8 hours. Tick paralysis Treatment simply involves removing the tick, which results in full recovery in 24-48 hours.Weakness 602 Primary ComplaintsEvaluation of any patient with the acute onset of motor weakness should include examining forthe presence of a tick, especially in high-risk geo-graphical regions. Special patients As with many other disease processes, specialconsideration should be given to very young chil-dren and elderly patients with generalized acutemotor weakness, as mild progression of diseasemay lead to rapid respiratory decompensation.Patients with sickle cell disease are at high risk forcerebrovascular events even at young ages. Paycareful attention to symptoms of underlyingmajor depression in patients carrying a diagnosisinvolving long-term progressive motor weaknesssuch as ALS or MS, and ensure that adequateresources are made available to the patient. In addition, make an effort to ensure that the familymembers and other direct caregivers of thesepatients are exposed to outside resources and aregiven the chance for respite if needed, as thesepeople themselves are quite special. Disposition Although controversial, these authors feel thatall patients presenting to the ED with AIS shouldbe admitted to the hospital. Whether or not thepatient receives thrombolytic therapy, coordin-ated inpatient efforts should occur to maximizethe patient's opportunity for improved outcome.Occupational and physical therapy teams shouldbe involved with the stroke patient's care, as wellas speech therapy when appropriate. Rehabili-tation efforts should be initiated as early aspossible, and special attention should be given to watch for signs of depression, a significant co-morbidity of ischemic stroke. Swallowingevaluations help prevent aspiration pneumonia,and DVT prophylaxis should be initiated ifpatients are bedridden. Some patients may beable to be discharged home after a short hospitalstay, but many require extended care in rehabili-tation facilities. For TIA, virtually all patients should be admitted for a complete work-up as previouslyoutlined. The only exceptions are patients inwhom a complete work-up, including head CT,laboratory studies, carotid Doppler imaging, andMRI/MRA along with formal neurology con-sultation can be carried out from the emergencycare area in a timely fashion. Since such an expedited work-up and consultation is rarely possible, admission for appropriate work-up andpharmacotherapy determination is recommended. In the case of other etiologies of acute motor weakness, the emergency physician's assessmentof overall respiratory function is the key toappropriate patient disposition. All patients inwhom moderate to severe respiratory compro-mise is either observed or anticipated requireadmission to an intensive care unit. Others withthe potential for respiratory compromise shouldbe admitted and adequately monitored. As ageneral rule, patients with a new diagnosis of anacute cause of motor weakness should probablybe admitted for observation and education. If urgent neurology consultation and prompt follow-up are available, less severe cases may besent home if the patient and family members arecomfortable with this arrangement. However,discharge home should only be considered incases where rapid progression of disease isunlikely and only after thorough patient educa-tion has occurred. Pearls and pitfalls There is no substitute for a careful andthorough neurologic examination. Ampletime practicing and reviewing the proper and complete technique helps determine the diagnosis, treatment, and disposition. A complete neurologic examination should be performed and documented, includingmental status, CNs, motor strength in allextremities, gross sensation, DTRs, andcerebellar function in anypatient presenting to the ED with the complaint of weakness,dizziness, headache, or visual problems.\"Neuro WNL (within normal limits)\" doesnot suffice! AIS care is extremely time-dependent.Protocols designed to streamline acute strokepatients into the optimal care scenario before the patient arrives are warranted. Consider TIA as \"unstable angina of thebrain,\" and treat these patients with theproper urgency. Patients with true TIAshould not be discharged without adequatework-up andinitiation or advancement of antiplatelet therapies. When the diagnosis is in doubt, alwaysobtain formal neurologic consultation for thepatient with true acute motor weakness. If consultation and/or the proper imagingPrimary Complaints 603Weaknesstechniques are unavailable, admit or transfer the patient as the situation dictates.

Occupational exposures in the emergency department 669Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 607Child abuse, elder abuse, intimate partner violence Scope of the problem Emergency physicians ar e specialists in dealing with violence-related problems. Emergency phys- icians treat both victims and perpetrators of violence, often on a daily basis. Additionally,emergency department (ED) staff may becomethe target of violence at the hands of their patientsor their patient's families and associates. Thischapter covers ED treatment of patients suffering from child abuse, intimate partner violence (IPV), and elder abuse. Management of the vio-lent patient is covered in Chapter 10. In the US, over 3000 children, women, and elders die yearly from abuse. Additionally, thereare 3 million reports of child abuse, 2 millioncases of elder abuse, and 2-4 million cases of IPVeach year. Emergency physicians are in a uniqueposition to identify abusive situations beforethey result in permanent physical or psychologicdisability or death. A Kansas City study foundthat the majority of family violence homicide vic-tims were seen in local EDs or other health caresettings in the year before they were killed. Due to the relative isolation of many victims, a visit to the ED may be the only opportunity forabuse detection. Recognition of victimized indi-viduals often requires a high degree of examinersuspicion. Although physical injuries may be thepresenting complaint of many abused patients,these victims (or their caretakers) rarely disclosethe true mechanism of injury. Victims may fearretaliation by the perpetrator or ambivalence about separation. Caretakers may not disclose theabuse because they themselves are the abusers, orbecause they are unaware of the abuse by anotherperson. Furthermore, the majority of reportedcases of child and elder abuse involve neglect,which may present with medical problems result-ingfrom poor nutrition, poor hygiene, or lack of needed medications and care. Elder neglect is defined as the refusal or failure of a caregiver to fulfill his or her obligations orduties to an elderly person, including (but notlimited to) providing food, clothing, medicine,shelter, supervision, medical care, and servicesthat a prudent person would deem essential forthe well-being of another. Intimate partner violence is defined as a pattern of assault or coercive behavior of one intimate part-ner by the other, including physical, sexual, andpsychologic abuse. IPV is repetitive (victims typi-cally suffer six episodes per year) and often esca-lates. Women comprise the vast majority of IPVvictims, although physicians must consider thepossibility of male victims in the appropriate set-ting. IPV victims are at higher risk for chronic pain,substance abuse, depression, and suicide attempts,which makes IPV a significant public health issue.Over a lifetime, at least one out of three women inthe US will be physically assaulted by a partner.Approximately 2% of female patients presentingto the ED are seeking care for injuries inflicted bytheir partners. Unlike children and dependentadults, victims of IPV are by and large consideredcompetent adults; therefore, the definition doesnot include neglect . The following discussion focuses on the four main goals that emergency staff must have wheninteracting with victims of violence: identification,treatment, documentation, and referral. Identification According to current research, patients pres-enting to EDs support routine questioning bydoctors and nurses about violence. Most casesrequire investigation on the physician's part, as victims rarely disclose abuse without prompting.Patients may feel embarrassed or guilty abouttheir situation. Victims often feel that they deservethe physical violence, as this is what the parent,caretaker, or intimate partner has repeatedly told them. In addition, victims may worry about the con- sequences of legal intervention. Abusers may bearrested and incarcerated. Victims of child andelder abuse may be removed from the home andplaced in foster care or an institution. Victims mayalso worry about further abuse from the perpet-rator for having disclosed an abusive situation.Carolyn J. Sachs, MD, MPH41 Child abuse, elder abuse, intimate partner violenceChild abuse, elder abuse, intimate partner violence 608 Unique Issues in Emergency MedicinePreverbal children or demented elders may be unable to provide any history. Although inquiring about abuse may seem difficult at first, recognizing that it is important,legitimate, potentially lifesaving, and often legally mandated should help clinicians overcome their initial resistance. Clinicians can help patientsfeel more comfortable disclosing abuse by framingquestions in ways that let patients know that theyare not alone, that the provider takes this issueseriously, that the provider is comfortable hearingabout abuse, and that help is available. With prac-tice, each clinician will develop his or her ownstyle of asking questions about abuse. Patientsmust be questioned about abuse independently(i.e., without family members or friends present). 1.Framing questions . Sometimes it is awkward to introduce the subject of abuse. The following are examples of ways providerscan introduce the topic:\"Because violence is common in patient'slives, I now ask every patient in mypractice about violence.\" \"I don't know if this is a problem for you, but many patients are dealing withabusive relationships. Some are to afraid oruncomfortable to bring it up themselves, soI've started asking about it routinely.\" \"Some patients think they deserve abusebecause they have not lived up to someoneelse's (parent's, caregiver's, or partner's)expectations. No matter what someone hasor hasn't done, no one deserves to beabused. Have you ever been hit orthreatened because of something you didor didn't do?\" \"Because so many patients I see in mypractice are involved with someone whohits them, threatens them, continually putsthem down, or tries to control them, I nowask all my patients about abuse.\" Specifically for caregivers: \"It must bedifficult to care for such an active child oran elder relative who needs so muchattention. How do you cope when you feel frustrated? What sources of respite doyou use?\" 2.Direct questions . However one initially raises the issue of violence, it is also important toinclude direct and specific questions:\"Did someone hit you? Are youcomfortable telling me who did this toyou? Are you comfortable telling thepolice about it?\"\"Has your caregiver, parent, partner, or ex-partner ever hit you or physically hurtyou? Has she/he ever threatened to hurtyou or someone close to you?\" \"I'm concerned that your symptoms mayhave been caused by someone hurtingyou. Has someone been hurting you?\" \"Does your caregiver, parent, or partnerever try to control you by threatening tohurt you or your family?\" \"Has your partner ever forced you to havesex when you didn't want to? Has he everrefused to practice safe sex?\" \"Has your caregiver ever touched you inplaces that made you feel uncomfortable?\" \"Has your partner tried to restrict yourfreedom or keep you from doing thingsthat were important to you, like going toschool or work, or visiting your friends orfamily?\" \"Does your parent, caregiver, or partnerfrequently belittle you, insult you, andblame you?\" \"Do you feel controlled or isolated by yourcaregiver or partner?\" \"Do you ever feel afraid of your caregiver,parent, or partner? Do you feel you are indanger? Is it safe for you to go home?\" History Child abuse Children presenting with injuries that seemincompatible with the given history or withinjuries that have no logical explanation shouldraise a red flag for abuse. Although the majority ofinjured children seen in the ED are not victimsof abuse, ED staff must maintain a high index ofsuspicion to identify the approximately 10% ofinjured children who are abused. To encouragedisclosure, examiners must obtain the history ina nonaccusatory manner. If the child is verbal, aseparate history should be obtained from thechild and the car etaker when each is alone (i.e., without other family members or friends pres- ent). It may be helpful for an examiner to simplyexplain that he/she is concerned about thechild's safety without blaming any specific per-son, and will need to call in another person tohelp with the evaluation (i.e., child protective services or a social worker). Any child who pres-ents with a change in mental status or seizures must raise concern for intracranial injury fromabuse. The most common form of head injuryUnique Issues in Emergency Medicine 609Child abuse, elder abuse, intimate partner violencefrom abuse is due to \"shaken baby syndrome,\" the forcible shaking of an infant r esult ing in sub- dural hematomas, retinal hemorrhages, and dif-fuse brain injury. Elder abuse In elderly patients, female gender, cognitiveimpairment, and increased dependency are uni-versally considered risk factors for abuse. Certainchief complaints commonly encountered in mal-treated elderly include injuries, pressure ulcers,falls, dehydration, and functional decline. All ofthese may be a sign of abusive behavior or neglect. Intimate partner violence Although not well-proven in prospective studies,experts consider the following historical factorssuggestive of intimate partner abuse: frequentphysician visits for trauma, chronic pain syn-dromes or gastrointestinal (GI) complaints, delaysin seeking medical treatment after an injury, anoverprotective partner, injuries during pregnancy,a history of depression or suicide attempts, and ahistory of prior abuse or abuse in the family. Thepresence of any of these factors should heightena clinician's suspicion for violence as an etiologyfor the visit. Clinicians should be especially dili-gent in questioning patients who present withdepression, anxiety, substance abuse, or symp-toms lacking a clear etiology. Physical examination The majority of injuries seen in pediatric EDpatients are not due to abuse, as active childrensustain many injuries unintentionally. Theseinjuries are often termed \"accidental\" injuries.Most educators prefer the adjective \"uninten-tional\" to \"accidental\" when describing theseinjuries, as \"accidental\" implies that nothing couldhave been done to prevent the injury. In fact, manyunintentional injuries can be prevented with safetyprecautions, such as making sure that the waterheater is set below 104\u00b0F to avoid scald injuries inthe bathtub. Intentionally-inflicted injuries (those from abuse) fr equently differ significantly from the unintentional injuries seen du ring usual activity. Toddlers learning to walk almost universally dis- play unintentional bruises or cuts to the foreheadfrom frequent collisions with furniture or thefloor. Conversely, common physical injuries fromabuse include bruises without a logical explan- ation, burns, fractures, lacerations, abrasions, andsignificant head injury. Perpetrators of abusemay purposely injure victims in areas that are usually covered by clothing. Hence, patients must be completely disrobed to identify possibleinjuries. In children and dependent adults, phys-ical manifestations of neglect may be uncoveredduring the examination. These include failure togrow and/or reach develop mental milestones, dehydration, malnutrition, late-stage bedsores,inappropriate clothing, and improper administra- tion of medications. Table 41.1 lists various child-hood injuries indicative of abuse. Any injury without a logical explanation in adult patients should raise suspicion for abuse.Many of the same injuries described in Table 41.1should raise red flags for IPV and elder abusewhen found in adults. While unintentional injuriesmay occur anywhere (given a credible history),certain locations are more difficult to injure acci- dentally and warrant careful scrutiny for abuse.Unintentional injuries tend to occur in a distaland/or lateral anatomic distribution, as theseareas have greater exposure and are more likelyto be injured while running into objects. Distaland lateral body parts (e.g., outstretched arms,knees, and shins) generally provide protectionwhen you fall. Therefore, central injuries to theface, neck, breasts, and abdomen should raisesuspicion for intentional trauma. Unintentionalinjuries also tend to be unilateral. It is rare toTable 41.1 Physical indicators of child abuse Any unexplained change in mental status should raise concern for occult head injury and \"shaken baby syndrome\" Metaphyseal fractures (Figure 41.8) Posterior rib fractures Unexplained retinal hemorrhages Symmetric extremity injuries Multiple injuries at different stages of healing Scapular fractures Spinous process fractures Sternal fractures Vertebral body fractures Multiple skull fractures Circumferential immersion burns (Figure 41.6a) Buttock burns Cigarette burns Evidence of poor care or failure-to-thrive Blunt instrument marks (belts, bats, rods) Patterned burns Human hand marks Bite markssustain symmetrical bruises from an unintentional mechanism. It is always important to considerthe history in context of the injury. Examples ofintentionally-inflicted bilateral injuries includefinger tip grab marks on both arms, bruises onthe medial aspect of upper arms from havingthem pinned down by the perpetrator's knees, andinner thigh bruises from forced sexual assault. Any injury to the genital or rectal area should raise suspicion for sexual assault and abuse.Unintentional injuries to this area, termed straddle injuries , are rare. Straddle injuries to the female genitalia usually result in trauma to the anteriorportion around the urethra. In females, genitalinjuries from assault are likely to be found moreposteriorly, posterior fourchette, 41.1). Females and maydisplay anal injuries after abuse from sodomy orattempted sodomy (Figure 41.2). Oral injuries maybe found after forced oral copulation of children,intimate partners, or adults. Emergency physi-cians must examine the oral cavity for lacerations,petechiae, and contusions in all suspected cases.Intentionally abused victims often display defen-sive injuries, such as scratch marks from trying topry off the perpetrator's hands, injuries to dorsumof hands when victim tries to protect his or her Child abuse, elder abuse, intimate partner violence 610 Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine Figure 41.1 Genital injury from assault.

The photodemonstrates CFNP .Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 611Child abuse, elder abuse, intimate partner violence face, or forearm contusions and fractures (termed \"nightstick\" fractures). In patients of any age, \"patterned\" injuries should raise suspicion for intentionality. Patternedinjuries reflect the shape of objects used to inflictintentional injuries (Figure 41.3). They usuallyhave sharper edges and are more geometric thanthe typical unintentional injury. Common objectswhich leave patterned injuries include hands,rods, belts, and cords (Figure 41.4). After being slapped, a bruise in the shape of the entire digitsmay be left, with \"fingers\" visible. Slaps moreoften result in parallel linear bruises from capil-laries breaking at skin areas between fingers.Burn patterned injuries are common in childabuse, but may also be found in IPV and elderabuse. (Figure 41.5). These burns occur by threemechanisms: contact burns (i.e., clothes or curlingirons), liquid burns (sharply demarcated burns tothe wrists or ankles (Figure 41.6) or burns to thegenital area inflicted during toilet training), andfriction burns (on the torso from being draggedover the ground or on the wrists and ankles frombeing tied up). Diagnostic tests In cases of suspected child and elder abuse,emergency physicians must evaluate for injuriesfrom prior episodes of abuse. In children, thisincludes a \"skeletal survey,\" consisting of radio-graphs of the entire body to detect old or heal-ing fractures (Figures 41.7 and 41.8). Suspectedshaken baby syndrome mandates evaluation forintracranial injury with brain computed tomo-graphy (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),as well as a detailed ophthalmologic evaluation forretinal hemorr hages. Laboratory studies are rarely helpful in the evaluation of suspected abuse. In specific clinical situations involving multiplebruises of an unknown origin, coagulation studiesand platelet testing may help exclude the possibil-ity of a bleeding disorder. Occasionally, geriatric patients experience such severe abuse and neglect that they areseverely dehydrated, or possibly septic, from aurinary tract infection (UTI).

Treatment Child abuse Most institutions have written protocols for treat- ing victims of child abuse. Emergency physiciansshould know where to locate these protocols andhow to utilize them. Hospitalization may be indi-cated for injuries, as well as to allow time for childprotective services (CPS) to investigate the sourceof the injury and whether or not the child is safe athome. When there are other children at home, thesafety of these children must also be considered.Appropriate identification of minor abusive trauma and subsequent parental education hasthe potential to prevent future abuse. Elder abuse If the patient no longer has the capacity to makereaso nable decisions for him- or herself, law enforcement or adult protective services (APS)should be contacted.

In some cases of neglect, APS may provide needed assistance to caregivers so thatfurther neglect is avoided and the patient mayremain at home. In other cases, APS may estab- lish a court-ordered guardianship or conserva-torship to arrange shelter, finances, and care. Thephysician should carefully document the find-ings of mistreatment or self-neglect and the rea-sons for declaring the patient incapable of actingin his or her own best interest. When a patient agrees to intervention, a variety of options can be exercised depending on the typeof abuse. If the situation involves physical abuse, severe neglect, or abandonment, and no immedi-ate solution can be arranged, hospital admission iswarranted. Admission provides the opportunityfor necessary medical treatment and additionaltime to activate the appropriate social supportresources. It also separates the victim from the abuser. Most often, medical complications for aspecific problem (i.e., decubiti or dehydration)warrant admission independent of the abuse itself. In non-life-threatening situations, a solution can be tailored to fit individual circumstances.Even though the caregiver may be the source ofabuse, she/he is also likely to provide the greatestamount of support for the victim. Whenever pos-sible, treatment includes crisis intervention withfamily members. Options for support should beprovided to the family in an attempt to diffusethe stress and anxiety that preceded the abuse.Examples include home health aides, respite ser-vices, day programs, or transportation assistance if the caregiver is overburdened or ill-equippedto deal with the patient's needs. Intimate partner violence Victims of IPV often present with traumatic injuries or medical conditions requiring treat-ment. Physical symptoms should not be minim-ized nor ascribed solely to IPV . The majority oftreatment will focus on treating the victim's psy-che. Brief supportive counseling by physiciansmay result in a dramatic catharsis for a victim whountil then has been suffering in silence. It is veryimportant for the physician to let a victim knowthat the abuse and violence is nother or his fault. Victims universally feel that they did something to deserve the abuse. Abusers repeat this messageto their victim with every beating. A few kind,supportive words from an authority figure such as a physician goes a long way in alleviating someof the guilt and shame a victim feels once herabuse has been revealed. Several comforting phrases to use after any type of abuse is uncovered are listed below: 1.\"No one deserves to be physically abused.

Some states also provide forms to document IPV and other violent injuries. Mostof these forms are available in the ED. Practitionersmust be familiar with these forms and the organ-izations (i.e., CPS, APS, and law enforcement)where these forms must be sent. Documentation of family violence in the med- ical chart may be the only written evidence ofabuse, and may play a crucial role in aiding thepatient. Appropriate documentation by the phys-ician can be crucial in subsequent legal proceed-ings against the perpetrator or in child custodycases. Many district attorney offices file chargesagainst perpetrators of family violence basedsolely on carefully documented medical, protectiveservice, and police records, and do not require thatthe victim press charges or testify in court againstthe perpetrator. Clear physician documentationcan make or break a case in these circumstances. Guidelines for effective documentation include the following: 1.Record what the patient and/or caretaker tells you using exact words in quotations. 2.Spontaneous utterances such as \"He said he was going to beat me until he killed me\"can be used in court and for dangerassessment. 3.Record prior incidents of abuse, includinguse of or access to a weapon. 4.Specific threats made by the perpetratorshould be recorded in quotations. 5.Record any inconsistencies that lead you tosuspect abuse despite caretaker or patientdenial. 6.Record the name and relationship of allegedperpetrator and time, date, and place ofassault using the exact address if possible. 7.Record details of the injury and identify itslocation on a body map. 8.Record old injuries as well as new ones. 9.Document the services provided during thevisit, either in the physician note or the socialworker/victim advocate note. These includeCPS or APS reports made, physical evidencegiven to police, photographs taken, referralsgiven, assessment of the patient's safety, andsubsequent medical care offered orrecommended. Photography Carefully obtained photographs of injuries pro-vide victims and protective authorities with permanent evidence of the assault, even after the injuries have healed. As with appropriatewritten documentation, photographs can make a difference in subsequent legal proceedings. Clinicians have several options for photograph- ing injuries; the best method depends on what isavailable in each setting. Instant photography (i.e.,Polaroid) is convenient and used most often inEDs. Photographs can be affixed to the chart andare extremely valuable in court. Other types ofphotography (35-mm film, digital, slide film, orvideo) can be used as long as a secure chain of evi-dence can be established. Every step of theprocess, from picture taking to film developingand return, should be accounted for and signedover on a written form. Most institutions that util-ize colposcopy for sexual assault examinationshave a formal protocol for dealing with photo-graphic evidence. It often involves handing overthe film or digitally-recorded images to lawenforcement at the end of the examination. Theseprotocols can be easily adapted to family violencephotography. Although not mandated by all states, consent for photography is required by most institutionsin competent patients. In children and dependentadults when the legal guardian is the suspectedperpetrator, most state laws allow photographsand evidence collection without guardian con-sent. Clinicians must be knowledgeable of theirown state and institutional policies regarding this. Photographs should include a standard, such as a ruler, so the size of the injury can be easilydetermined. With proper photographic docu-mentation, forensic experts can comment on thelikelihood that a particular person or a givenweapon caused a particular injury. Retrospect-ively, properly photographed and measured bite marks can often be matched to potentialperpetrator. At least one photograph that includesthe patient's face with the injury is recommendedso the identification of the injured person cannotbe challenged. All photographs should be labeledwith patient information, date, time, location, andphotographer's name. Physical evidence Victims of family violence who are also recent victims of sexual assault must be offered an evi-dentiary examination and the standard physicalevidence collection per state protocol. In typicalcases of family violence, physical evidence, whenapplicable, should also be collected and turnedover to police using the format stipulated by sex-ual assault protocols. Appropriate specimens Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 615Child abuse, elder abuse, intimate partner violenceChild abuse, elder abuse, intimate partner violence 616 Unique Issues in Emergency Medicineinclude torn or bloody clothing, saliva from bite marks, and bullet, glass, or other weapon frag-ments. All evidence should be placed in paper(not plastic) bags to avoid bacterial overgrowthand decomposition of the specimen. As withphotographs from sexual assaults, transfer of thismaterial must be documented through a written\"chain of evidence.\" Referral After identification of abuse, referral is perhapsthe physician's most crucial intervention fordealing with victims of family violence. Identifi-cation, documentation, and treatment of injuriesmean little unless a victim or caretaker is giventhe resources needed to change the situation. Insome cases, government agencies remove thevictim from the dangerous situation. These agenc-iesmay take legal action against the perpetrator so others will not suffer similar abuse. In general, emergency physicians have neither the time nor the expertise to comprehensivelycounsel a victim or caretaker. Referral services ful- fill this important obligation. The level of referral depends on the nature of the abusive situationand, in competent adults, the victim's desire forintervention. Many hospitals and clinics have adedicated social worker on staff to respond to theED, and often have a specific team of cliniciansthat help evaluate suspected cases of child abuse,sexual assault, and elder abuse. Many EDs have anaffiliation with a victim's group or local woman'sshelter that will assist in caring for victims of IPV .Under some circumstances, these groups willdispatch a representative to the medical settingfor immediate counseling, legal advocacy, andplacement (if necessary). The revelation of abuse in the medical setting often comes at a time of crisis. This creates a win-dow of opportunity for intervention, at a timewhen a victim or caretaker is more likely to agreeto or desire a change in their situation. Immediatecontact with experienced advocates often makes a tremendous differ ence. Medical personnel may be unaware of these services within their institu- tion or community. The names and numbers of these local services must be included in a writtenED protocol. In fact, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcar eO rganizations (JCAHO) and several state laws mandate a writ-ten protocol for treatment and referral of victimsof family violence. Web-based information often provides links to local resources in the user's area.Furthermore, information on state laws pertain-ing to abuse can be found through each state'slegislative web site. Child and elder abuse hotlines are available in all locations, but vary by jurisdiction. These num-bers should be readily available in all EDs. Theycan be found in the phone book or from callinginformation. The US national IPV hotline (800-799-SAFE) can be used by victims and practition-ers 24 hours a day, and will automatically directcallers to local shelter services. For hearing-impaired victims of IPV , the TTY number is 800-787-3224. Safety assessment All victims of child or elder abuse must receive asafety assessment by either the hospital socialworker, abuse team, or protective services. In situations of a competent adult without otherresources, a physician or nurse may perform safety assessments. Experts feel that danger increaseswith increasing numbers of positive answers onthe safety scr een. The danger assessment screen developed by Campbell after decades of research in IPV homicide may be used for this purpose(Figure 41.9). Physician assessment of safetyshould also include an assessment of suicide andhomicide risk by the victim. Suicide risk increasesin the presence of IPV , and homicide of the battereris possible if the victim feels that this is her or hisonly way out. Acutely suicidal or homicidal vic-tims warrant immediate psychiatric consultationand admission. Reporting Child abuse All 50 states mandate reporting of any suspected child abuse and neglect by medical professionalsto local CPS. Failure to report suspected abusemay result in fines, jail time, and successful civilsuit against practitioners. Forms to report abuseand agencies which accept these reports vary byjurisdiction. Elder abuse Presently, 47 states require reporting of elder abuse to APS or law enforcement. Abuse suffered bynursing home patients should be reported underthe national Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Actof 1987 (OBRA 1987). This law established state-run nursing home ombudsman programs whichUnique Issues in Emergency Medicine 617Child abuse, elder abuse, intimate partner violence DANGER ASSESSMENT Several risk factors have been associated with increased risk of homicides (murders) of women and men in violent relationships.

Nursing home residents must have access to a designated ombudsmanfor that facility. Physicians who suspect abuse ininstitutionalized elderly must report suspicionsof abuse to the state ombudsman, APS, or lawenforcement. Intimate partner violence Few states have statutes addressing medical treat- ment of IPV specifically, but IPV reporting falls under other state statutes. Currently, all but fivestates require some reporting of injured victims ofIPV under laws which require reporting of any injured person. Forty-two states requirehealth providers to report injuries resulting fromfirearms, knives, or other weapons to law enforce-ment. Additionally, 23 states require reports of injuries resulting from \"crimes\" or \"violently-inflicted injuries.\" A complete list of state reportinglaws pertaining to injured patients can be foundin the references section. Conclusion The entire ED staff plays a critical role in the identi-fication of abused children, intimate partners, and dependent elders. Their role continues to be crit-ical in documenting, treating, and referring thesepatients. ED staff must be comfortable questioningpatients about abuse, and must be aware of com-munity resources available to aid these victimizedpopulations. It is best to remain an advocate forthese patients, and to arrange an appropriate safetyassessment following a complete history andphysical examination; ensure detailed documenta-tion and careful evidence collection before con-sidering discharge from the ED.

However, 10 times that number of elderlypatients with underlying cardiopulmonary dis-ease are thought to die annually from heat-related complications. The two major heat illnesses are heat exhaus- tion and heat stroke. Heat exhaustion is a syndrome characterized by volume depletion. The core temperature is generally /H1102140.5\u00b0C. Mental status is normal. Heat stroke is a medical emergency characterized by a core temperature /H1102240.5\u00b0C and altered mental status. Anumber of minor heat illnesses have also been described, including heat cramps, heat edema,heat syncope, heat tetany, and prickly heat.Malignant hyperthermia is characterized by veryhigh core temperature and altered mental status,but is not considered an environmental illness. Heat cramps are painful muscle cramps which generally occur after exercise in unacclimatized individuals who sweat freelyand replace sweat losses with large amountsof water or other hypotonic fluids.Hyponatremia may also occur in thisscenario. Heat edema is a benign condition, most often found in the elderly, in which swelling occursin the feet and sometimes the hands duringthe first few days in a hot environment. Heat syncope is a self-limited condition usually found in unacclimatized persons.Prolonged standing causes venous pooling inthe legs which, combined with peripheralvasodilation and volume loss, causesorthostatic hypotension and fainting. Heat tetany is caused by hyperventilation after brief exposure to intense heat. Prickly heat , also known as heat rash, lichen rash foundin areas of the body covered by clothing. It iscaused by obstruction of sweat ducts. Pathophysiology Body temperature regulation is a balance between heatproduction and heat loss . Basal heat production is approximately 40-60 kcal/m 2body surface area/ hour. Voluntary exercise can increase heat produc- tion up to 20 times. Metabolism may also beincreased by hyperthyroidism or by ingestion ofsympathomimetic drugs. Environmental heatadds to the heat load and can interfere with heatdissipation. Heat is lost by radiation, conduction, convection, and evaporation . Radiation is the exchange of radi- ant energy with the surrounding environment.Conduction is the exchange of heat by direct con-tact with a cooler object. Convection is the trans-fer of heat to (or from) gas or liquid, such as airand water moving by the body. Evaporation isthe conversion of liquid to gas, such as sweat towater vapor, which requires energy and removesheat from the body. In hot conditions, conduc-tion, convection, and radiation often transfer heatto the body; the evaporation of sweat is the dom-inant mechanism of heat loss. Evaporation of 1 Lof sweat removes approximately 600 kcal of heat. Heat loss in a hot environment can impose large metabolic demands on the body . Skin blood flow may increase from /H110210.5 to 7-8 L/minute in a hot environment. Exercising in a hot environmentmay be associated with sweat losses of 1-2 L/hour. Peripheral vasodilation and fluid lossesfrom sweating reduce stroke volume. The hearttypically compensates with an increased rate ifpossible. Acclimatization is the adaptation of the body to heat stress . After daily exercise in a hot environment for 1-2 weeks, sweating increases, occurs at lowercore temperatures, and contains less sodium chlor-ide. Peripheral blood flow increases. Increased plasma volume leads to higher stroke volume and42 Environmental emergencies HEAT ILLNESS Ken Zafren, MDHeat illness 620 Unique Issues in Emergency Medicinea lower heart rate resulting in increased exercise tolerance. Acclimatization is lost over about 1week in the absence of continued exposure to heat. Heat exhaustion is a poorly-defined clinical syndrome characterized by volume depletion.Various combinations of water and salt depletion can be found depending on the amount of waterand electrolytes used to replace fluid losses.Symptoms are similar whether the lost volumehas not been replaced (\"water depletion\") orreplaced using water \"water depletion\" and\"salt depletion\" are misleading, since in bothcases volume (not free water only) has been lost. Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition in which the thermoregulatory mechanisms fail,allowing extremely high core temperatures. Thebrain is particularly vulnerable to damage, butmultiple organ systems are affected. Coagulationabnormalities, as well as damage to the liver orkidneys are common. Cellular damage dependsmore on the duration of exposure than on themaximum core temperature. In the past, theabsence of sweating was considered important tothe diagnosis of heat stroke. However, patientswith early heat stroke may still sweat. Tradition-ally, a distinction has been made between \"exer-tional\" heat stroke, caused by exercise in a hotenvironment with increased heat production,and \"non-exertional\" (classic) heat stroke, due toincreased exogenous heat gain and decreasedability to lose heat. This difference has little clin-ical significance. History Does the patient have a reason forheat illness? The diagnosis of heat illness is usually straight- forward. Predisposing factors fit into three broadcategories: increased heat gain from the environment increased internal heat production decreased ability to dissipate excess heat. Does the patient have an associated condition predisposing to heat illness orcaused by heat illness? Heat illness may coexist with other diagnoses, such as fever or trauma. Heat illness may causetrauma due to an altered level of consciousnessor syncope.Is the patient predisposed to heat illness bynot being acclimatized? Risk of heat illness is highest in late spring or early summer, during heat waves, and in personswho have recently arrived at warmer climates. Does the patient have weakness, fatigue, headache, light-headedness, vertigo,nausea, vomiting, or myalgias? These are symptoms of both heat exhaustion and heat stroke, and do not distinguish betweenthe two. Has the patient had hallucinations? Hallucinations suggest heat stroke. Does the patient have vomiting or diarrhea? These are common in heat stroke, but uncom- mon in heat exhaustion. Increased heat gain from the environment Does the patient have a reason for increased heat gain from the environment? Exposure to high temperatures and high humid- ity may lead to heat illness. During heat waves,lack of access to air conditioning is a risk factorfor heat stroke. Even during less extreme peri-ods, there are many microclimates that can createconsiderable heat stress. These include indoor oroutdoor areas exposed to direct sun, upper floorsof buildings, car interiors, boiler rooms, hot tubs,and saunas. Increased internal heat production Does the patient have a reason for increasedinternal heat production? Has he or she been exercising in a hot environment? Has the patient been using medications, alcohol, or illicit drugs which increase heatproduction? Salicylates increase heat production by uncou- pling oxidative phosphorylation. The use of cer-tain drugs can cause increased activity orcombative behavior, drug withdrawal, seizuresor neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Drugs withUnique Issues in Emergency Medicine 621Heat illnesssympathomimetic properties, such as cocaine or amphetamines, cause increased activity.Drugs such as phencyclidine (PCP) effects. (MDMA or\"ecstasy\") is a drug used at dance parties(\"raves\"). The prolonged activity may lead toheat stroke. MDMA can also cause a clinical pic-ture similar to the syndrome of inappropriateantidiuretic hormone (SIADH), resulting in highurine sodium and osmolality despite hypotonichyponatremia and normal blood volume.Participants in rave parties are often aware of thedanger of heat stroke and have been told to drinkplenty of water. This response exacerbates hypo-natremia, which can cause seizures. Does the patient have a febrile illness causing increased heat production? The presence of cough, meningismus, or shaking chills suggest a febrile illness due to an infectiousetiology. Does the patient have another metabolic condition causing increased heatproduction, such as hyperthyroidism orpheochromocytoma? This will be identified by abnormal hormone levels. Decreased ability to dissipate excess heat Is the patient dehydrated or volume depleted? Lack of appropriate fluids to replace increased losses in a hot environment can reduce the abilityto lose heat through sweating and peripheralvasodilation. Has the patient been using alcohol or other drugs that increase fluid losses or interferewith behavioral responses to heat exposure? Alcohol predisposes to dehydration by inhibit- ing antidiuretic hormone. The use of alcohol andother drugs may decrease one's level of con-sciousness or alter judgment and interfere withthe behavioral response of seeking shelter awayfrom hot microclimates. Alcohol and otherdrugs, especially phenothiazines, may also limitthirst. Any mind-altering substance can interferewith the ability to obtain and drink fluids toreplace losses. Was the patient wearing clothing that decreased heat loss? Clothing that is too warm, especially vapor bar- rier clothing worn by those trying to lose weight,can markedly decrease heat loss. Past medical Cardiovascular disease Patients with cardiovascular disease may be unable to compensate for changes induced byheat stress, resulting in heat stroke or cardiaccomplications. Skin and systemic diseases Skin diseases that decrease the ability to sweat include eczema, psoriasis, burns, or heat rash.Systemic diseases ectodermal alpha-agonists decrease the heart's ability tocompensate for of heat and decreaseperipheral blood flow. Sympathomimetics limitskin vasodilation. Physical examination The primary goals of the physical examinationare to distinguish heat exhaustion from heatstroke, to identify diseases or underlying condi-tions which may have caused or contributed toheat illness, and to identify other conditions orinjuries which require treatment. The emphasishere is on heat stroke, because heat exhaustion isnot a life-threatening illness. General appearance The patient with heat stroke appears ill, and mostlikely will not be sweating. Other than body tem-perature, alteration of consciousness is the mainfeature which distinguishes heat str oke fr omheat exhaustion. Vital signs Core temperature is the temperature of internal organs. Its measurement is key to the evaluation and treatment of heat illness. In heat illness,brain temperature is of particular importance,because prolonged exposure to high temperaturesmay cause permanent brain damage. In heatexhaustion, core temperature is generally /H1102140\u00b0C. If altered mental status is present, or the coretemperature is /H1102240.5\u00b0C, the patient should be diagnosed with heat stroke. Core temperature maybe/H1102140\u00b0C in heat stroke if there is a delay of several hours after the acute event, but these patients aregenerally comatose. The best method of measuring core tempera- ture, especially in intubated patients, is with anesophageal probe. Brain temperature can be accu-rately measured using an epitympanic probe,which contacts the tympanic membrane. Thisdiffers from infrared tympanic temperaturemeasurement, which is unreliable. Unfortunately,epitympanic probes are not yet being marketedin North America. Rectal probe thermometers have been tradition- allyused, but rectal temperature changes signifi- cantly lag core temperature changes. Bladdertemperature is less reflective of core temperaturethan rectal temperature. Oral temperature varieswith respiration and is a poor reflection of coretemperature. In heat stroke, expect tachypnea, tachycardia, and normal to low blood pressure. Pulse pres-sure may be widened. Deviations from this mayprovide clues to underlying diagnoses. For exam-ple, excessive tachypnea may indicate salicylatetoxicity. Relative bradycardia may suggest cer-tain infectious diagnoses, such as typhoid fever,or reflect cardiac drugs, such as beta- or calcium-channel blockers. High blood pressure may be aclue to thyroid storm or pheochromocytoma. Heatexhaustion also presents with tachycardia. Neurologic Any neurologic sign may be found in heat stroke.Dysarthria and ataxia are common, but agitation,stroke-like symptoms, posturing, seizures, andcoma can all be identified. Miosis is often present. Skin At the time of collapse from heat stroke, mostpatients will be sweating profusely. By the timeof arrival in the emergency department (ED), theskin is often hot and dry. The presence of heatrash is a risk factor for heat stroke. Purpura indi-cates coagulation abnormalities, which implies apoor prognosis. Differential diagnosis If body temperature is /H1102240.5\u00b0C, rapid cooling measures must be initiated immediately. If cardio-vascular parameters impr ove and mental status returns to normal, most other diagnostic pos- sibilities are eliminated. If the core temperaturedoes not decrease or the mental status does notimprove, other etiologies must be investigated(Table 42.1). Unlike heat stroke, most febrile states which produce altered mental status are associated withnormal hepatic transaminases.

Hemoconcentra-tion is almost always present. Hypoglycemia iscommon, as are hypokalemia and hypernatremia.Renal failure may occur. Hepatic poor prognosis. Creatine kinase should be measured to assess for rhabdomyol ysis. No discrete cutoff exists, but values of /H110221000 U/L (approximately 5 times normal) are considered diagnostic. As the rise inCK begins 2-12 hours after muscle injury, earlydiagnosis and treatment may prevent renal damage. Amylase and lipase Both are likely to be elevated if pancreatitis is present.

Thyroid profile Thyroid profile should be obtained if thyroid storm is suspected. Cerebrospinal fluid Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies may be indi- cated if meningitis is suspected as a cause ofaltered mental status. Electrocardiogram An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtainedto rule out associated diagnoses, includingmyocardial infarction and drug toxicity. Radiologic studies Computed tomography (CT) of the head may benecessary as part of the evaluation of alteredmental status. General treatment principles As with all emergency patients, treatment begins with Airway, Breathing, and Circulation (ABCs).The main goal of treatment is rapid cooling. Onlyafter stabilizing measures have been initiatedshould a more detailed diagnostic work-up beundertaken. Airway, Breathing, Circulation The airway must be controlled, which includesintubation of the unconscious patient. Supple-mental oxygen should be administered. Intra-venous (IV) access should be established, butaggressive volume resuscitation is usually unnec-essary since cooling can be expected to decrease peripheral vasodilation. This decreases thedemands on the heart and raises blood pressure.Fingerstick glucose may reveal hypo- or hyper-glycemia. Continuous cardiac, pulse oxim etry, and temperature monitoring should be estab-lished. Cardiac monitor electrodes can be atta ched to the patient's back if they will not stick to thechest. A Foley catheter should be placed andurine output monitored. Urine temperature canbe measured with a Foley catheter probe if othermethods are not available. Cooling The patient should be immediately undressed.Ice packs can be placed in the axillae and groin.Evaporative cooling is the method of choice atmost institutions. Spraying lukewarm water overthe patient and blowing room temperature oreven heated air over the skin prevents cutaneousvasoconstriction and minimizes shivering. Asshivering causes undesired heat production, it can be treated with IV medications, such aschlorpromazine 25 mg or meperidine 100 mg.Hypotension is a concern with these drugs. Immersion cooling in ice water is also used in some circumstances, but has a number of practicaldrawbacks and may not be safe in patients whoare neither young nor healthy. Cardiopulmonarybypass is another alternative but is rarely neces-sary. It has been used successfully in the treat-ment of malignant hyperthermia. Peritoneallavage is also a possibility to decrease core tem-perature. Venous catheter heat exchangers havebeen used to produce controlled hypothermiaand are less invasive than cardiopulmonarybypass. They are as yet untested for treatment ofheat stroke. Cooling blankets are not effective. Cooling measures should be discontinued when body temperature reaches 39\u00b0C in order toavoid hypothermia. areeffective only in the event of fever and shouldnot be used in heat stroke. Dantrolene is indicatedin malignant hyperthermia or neuroleptic malig-nant syndrome, and has no effect on hyperther-mia due to other causes. Supportive care Volume status, glucose and electrolyte abnormal- ities, coagulopathies, seizures, and other compli-cations are managed in the standard fashion. Special patients Elderly Geriatric patients have decreased cardiovascularreserve and a decreased ability to sweat. Elderly patients may be further limited by cardiac and Heat illness 624 Unique Issues in Emergency Medicinevascular disease, complicating the management of heat stroke. They are often taking medications,such as beta-blockers, which decrease an indi-vidual's ability to dissipate heat. Pediatric Children have a greater surface area-to-massratio than adults, allowing for greater exogenousheat gain. They have a higher metabolic rate, increased heat production, and less ability to sweat than adults, limiting their ability to loseexcess heat by evaporative cooling. Obese Obese patients have a decreased surface area-to-mass ratio and decreased skin blood flow. Thephysical effects of adipose tissue predisposeobese people to heat illness. Disposition Patients with minor heat illnesses and mostpatients with heat exhaustion can safely be dis-charged home in the company of a reliable adult,with close outpatient follow-up. Infants and thevery elderly, individuals with underlying condi-tions predisposing to heat illness, those who aresignificantly volume depleted, and patients withend-organ damage due to heat illness should beadmitted. All patients with heat stroke should be admit- ted. Patients who are unstable should be admittedto an intensive care setting. This may require trans-fer to a hospital offering a higher level of care. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Pearls Heat stroke presents with altered level ofconsciousness. Consider heat syncope in a syncope work-up. Obtain as much history as possible about what the patient was doing and theenvironmental conditions during the timewhen the patient collapsed or had changes inbehavior.Aggressive fluid resuscitation is usually notnecessary. Aggressive immediate cooling isimperative. Pitfalls Not considering the diagnosis of heat stroke. Not measuring core temperature as soon oras often as possible, or using suboptimalmethods, such as oral or tympanicthermometers. Not considering associated diagnoses, suchas trauma or sepsis. N ot instituting cooling measures promptly. Using antipyretics to cool a patient sufferingfrom heat stroke. Giving excess fluids to a patient on MDMA,which can worsen hyponatremia and causeseizures. Myths A patient who is sweating cannot have heat stroke. A patient in the ED who has a normal core temperature and normal transaminasescannot have heat stroke.

Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 625Heat illnessScope of the problem Hypothermia is defined as a core temperature /H1102135\u00b0C (95\u00b0F). It can occur at any place and any time. Hypothermia is the stated cause of over 700deaths annually in the US. About half of thesedeaths occur in patients over 65 years of age. Primary hypothermia affects otherwise healthy patients exposed to cold environmental condi-tions. Secondary hypothermia is caused by a variety of diseases. Primary hypothermia is a disease ofwars throughout history. During peacetime, it ismost common in urban areas in association withhomelessness and the use of alcohol and otherdrugs. Also at risk are participants in outdooractivities, such as skiing, hunting, climbing, sail-ing, swimming, and diving. Secondary hypother-mia is associated with sepsis, trauma, and diseasessuch as hypoendocrine states, which decreasemetabolic rate, as well as conditions which affecthypothalamic function such as tumors and stroke.Elderly and ill patients are often found indoors inwell-heated houses, which may confuse the diag-nosis. Iatrogenic hypothermia may be induced by resuscitation with room temperature fluids or refrigerated blood products. Pathophysiology Body temperature regulation is a balance between heatproduction and heat loss . Heat production can be increased by increasing the metabolic rate, shiv-ering, or voluntary activity. Increased metabolicrate is mediated by thyroid and adrenal glands. Heat is lost by radiation, conduction, convection, and evaporation . These mechanisms are explained in the section on Heat illness. Wet clothingincreases the rate of heat loss up to fivefold,while immersion in water increases the rate asmuch as 25-30 times. Wind and moving waterfurther increase heat loss by disrupting the warmmicroclimate, which can otherwise protectagainst heat loss from skin. Evaporation of waterfrom the skin surface and from respiration mayalso cause significant heat loss. Heat loss can be limited by vasoconstriction and behavioral responses . Humans are adapted to trop- ical environments and have a limited ability todecrease heat loss by physiologic means. Themost important responses are usually behavioral,such as putting on warm clothing and seekingrefuge from cold environments. If these mecha- nisms are somehow limited, the risk of hypother-mia markedly increases. History History may be straightforward, especially in pri-mary hypothermia, or may be difficult to obtain,as in an unconscious patient found indoors. Where was the patient found? What was he or she doing? Patients found outdoors in cold conditions have one reason for being hypothermic, but there maybe predisposing causes for hypothermia, such astrauma or intoxication with alcohol or other drugs. Does the patient have an immobilizing condition or injury? The patient may have become hypothermic due to the inability to reach shelter. Does the patient have a metabolic cause for hypothermia? Metabolic causes include hypothyroidism, hypo-adrenalism, hypopituitarism, and hypoglycemia, which lead to decreased metabolic rates. Does the patient have another cause of hypothalamic dysfunction? These include head trauma, tumor, stroke, orWernicke's syndrome. Is the patient intoxicated? The use of alcohol and other sedative-hypnotics predisposes to hypothermia by interfering Alcoholcauses cutaneous vasodilation, which increasesheat loss from the skin. Could the patient be septic or in diabetic ketoacidosis? Hypothermia in sepsis carries a grave prognosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) also interferes withthermoregulatory mechanisms. Hypothermia 626 Unique Issues in Emergency MedicineHYPOTHERMIA Ken Zafren, MDHas the patient been resuscitated with room temperature fluid or chilled blood? Iatrogenic hypothermia is of particular importance in trauma patients receiving volume replacementtherapy. All trauma patients should receive IVfluids warmed to 40\u00b0C. Has the patient received drugs that decrease shivering? These include phenothiazines, meperidine, and buspirone. Chlorpromazine is commonly used intreatment of heat stroke to abolish shivering. Inmildly hypothermic patients, shivering is a majormechanism to increase core temperature. Past medical Use of phenothiazines is a risk factor for hypother-mia. Burns or exfoliating skin conditions predis- pose patients to increased heat loss. Physical examination The primary goals of the physical examinationare to establish the degree of hypothermia, toidentify diseases or underlying conditions whichmay have caused or contributed to hypothermia,and to identify associated injuries which requiretreatment. Airway, Breathing, Circulation As with all patients, the ABCs are of primaryimportance. These may be difficult to assess in a severely hypothermic patient, because respira- tory rate and heart rate may be extremely slow. Respirations are often very shallow, and pulsesare likely to be weak and difficult to palpatethrough cold skin. It is often hard to make car-diac monitor leads adhere to cold, moist skin,and pulse oximeters do not work on cool, vaso-constricted extremities. Level of consciousness Alert patients generally have only mild hypother-mia. Patients with alterations of consciousnessmust have etiologies other than hypothermia con-sidered as their cause of impaired consciousness. Vital signs Core temperature is the temperature of the keyinternal organs, primarily the heart. Preciselymeasuring the core temperature is key to theevaluation and treatment of hypothermia. Standard clinical thermometers may record temperatures only as low as 34\u00b0C. In case of alow reading, an electronic thermometer with anesophageal probe should be used. In mildhypothermia, a rectal temperature may be ade-quate. If a glass thermometer is used, it must be a\"low reading\" type. Rectal probe temperatureshave been used traditionally, but rectal tempera-ture changes significantly lag changes in coretemperature. Bladder temperature is even lessreflective of core temperature than is rectal tem- perature. Oral temperatures are notoriously inaccurate. As the patient cools, the initial response is tachycardia, after which there is progressivebradycardia. The heart rate is about 50% of normalat a core temperature of 28\u00b0C. If the heart rate isfaster than expected at a given temperature,other causes of tachycardia should be suspected,including hypovolemia, hypoglycemia, or drugingestions. Blood pressure and respiratory ratealso initially increase before declining, as hypo- thermia becomes more severe. Inappropriate res-piratory rates should suggest metabolic acidosisor a CNS lesion. Abdomen Decreased intestinal motility may lead toabdominal distention or rigidity, and may mimicor mask an acute abdomen. Neurologic Dysarthria and ataxia may be found in mildhypothermia. These are likely to increase in sever-ity at lower core temperatures. Reflexes are initiallyincreased, and then decrease before eventually dis-appearing as core temperature decreases. Muscletone increases in the preshivering phase. Shiveringis maximal at about 35\u00b0C, and gradually decreasesuntil the core temperature is about 31\u00b0C, at whichpoint shivering disappears entirely. Differential diagnosis Hypothermia is diagnosed by measuring coretemperature. However, conditions other thanenvironmental exposure can cause hypothermia.While not truly differential diagnoses, associateddiagnoses should be considered in hypothermicpatients. Table 42.2 is a partial list of etiologies toconsider. Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 627HypothermiaDiagnostic testing Laboratory studies Complete blood count Hematocrit increases about 2% with every 1\u00b0C decrease in temperature. A moderately orseverely hypothermic patient with a \"normal\"hematocrit is actually anemic. White blood cell and platelet counts are depressed by seques-tration.Metabolic profile Potassium levels are independent of temperature. However, hypothermia increases the toxic effectsof hyperkalemia. Blood glucose is increased inhypothermia, because endogenous insulin at temperatures /H1102130-32\u00b0C. Coagulation studies Hypothermia induces a coagulopathy, although coagulation studies are insensitive in thehypothermic patient.

Arterial blood gas Although blood gas values which are \"corrected\" for temperature are available, they should not beused. Uncorrected blood gas values should beused to guide treatment at all temperatures.Using \"corrected\" blood gas values will cause pHabnormalities. Electrocardiogram Numerous ECG changes can be found in thehypothermic patient. Prolongation of PR, QRS andQT intervals is usual; T wave inversion may beseen. Muscle tremor artifacts may make obtain-ing an adequate ECG difficult. The Osborne (J)wave, a slow deflection at the junction of the QRScomplex and the ST segment, is a common find-ing (Figure 42.1). These waves are usuallyupright in left-sided precordial leads. Dysrhyth-mias may include sinus tachycardia in mild hypother mia, sinus bradycardia, atrial fibrillation or contractions (PVCs), ventricular fibrillation (VF), or asystole.Atrial fibrillation is the most common dysrhyth-mia other than rate disturbances of sinus origin. Radiologic studies If trauma is suspected, cervical spine, chest, andpelvis films may be appropriate. Other X-raysand CT scans are indicated based on clinicalpresentation. General treatment principles As with all patients, treatment begins with the ABCs. After the emergency physician securesthese, an appropriate method of rewarming mustbe initiated, and volume status and electrolytefluxes must be managed. Initial resuscitation Endotracheal (ET) intubation is mandatory unlessthe patient is alert and protecting the airway. Thepatient should have continuous cardiac and vitalsign monitoring. Pulse oximetry is seldom possi-ble (or reliable) in the hypothermic patient due toperipheral vasoconstriction. Both a nasogastric(NG) tube and indwelling urinary catheter shouldbe gently inserted. Monitor the temperature continuously using an esophageal probe. Insulatethe patient to protect against further heat loss. If the heart is in ventricular fibrillation (VF) or asystole, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)should be initiated. If VF is present, three attemptsshould be made to defibrillate the patient, accord-ing to Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support(ACLS) guidelines. However, defibrillation is sel-dom successful if the patient's core temperature is/H1102128-30\u00b0C. Start CPR if the patient does not have a perfusing rhythm. Atrial dysrhythmias resolvewith rewarming and do not require treatment. Obtain IV access : Catheters inserted into the heart or pulmonary artery are contraindicated. Hypothermic patients are generally volumedepleted. Replace volume with D5NS initially.All IV fluids should be heated to 40-42\u00b0C to pre-vent further heat loss. Pharmacology The IV route is the only effective route of adminis-tration for medications, but most drugs are notactive at temperatures /H1102130\u00b0C. Protein binding of drugs increases in hypothermia, further limitingtheir effects. Medications given in the hypother-mic patient are generally ineffective until rewarm-ing takes place, after which they suddenly becomeeffective and possibly toxic. Thiamine and glucoseshould be given empirically. Rewarming Following initial stabilization, the emergencyphysician must choose a rewarming method.Passive rewarming refers to methods which use heat generated by the patient. Active rewarming methods add heat to the patient from othersources. Mildly hypothermic patients (core tem-perature 32-35\u00b0C) can be treated with passiveexternal rewarming, utilizing their own body heatand shivering to rewarm. In practice, most of thesepatients will receive active external rewarmingwith warm blankets or forced heated air.Hypothermic patients with body temperatures/H1102132\u00b0C, with cardiovascular instability, or with underlying conditions predisposing to hypother-mia require active core rewarming; this refers tomethods that preferentially heat the central Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 629Hypothermiaorgans. While there are many methods of active core rewarming, the most common are peri-toneal lavage and various bypass. The choiceof specific rewarming techniques is complex anddepends on institutional resources. Obtainingassistance from the nephrology , cardiac, or trauma surgery services may prove life-saving.Further management During rewarming, electrolyte and volume statusfluxes require active management. Coagulopathiesmay pose special problems. Also during thistime, underlying diseases and traumatic injuriesneed to be addressed. Close cardiopulmonarymonitoring and continued reassessment of neu-rologic status are crucial.

Courtesy :Joel Levis, MD.Special patients Elderly Geriatric patients are more prone to hypother- mia, tend to have more underlying diseases, andgenerally have less physiologic reserve thanyounger adults. They often require more aggres-sive treatment for hypothermia and its complica-tions. Geriatric patients with hypothermia shouldgenerally be treated as if they are septic. Pediatric Neonates require aggressive volume resuscitationin addition to the usual treatment of hypother-mia. Unless cold exposure is the clear cause ofhypothermia, pediatric patients should be evalu-ated and tr eated for sepsis. Immune compromised Sepsis may be an important cause of hypother-mia in immunocompromised patients. If there isany doubt, these patients should be presumptivelytreated for sepsis and aggressively rewarmed. Disposition Otherwise healthy patients with mild hypother-mia (32-35\u00b0C) due to cold exposure usually haveno difficulty being rewarmed. Generally, theycan be discharged safely unless they have associ-ated injuries, including frostbite, which necessi-tate hospital admission. All other patients withhypothermia require admission. In some cases,patients may require transfer to a center with thecapability to perform cardiopulmonary bypass. Serum potassium levels greater than 10 meq/L may correlate with an inability to resuscitate thehypothermic patient. This degree of hyperkalemiais a marker of cell lysis, and although not provenin hypothermia, has been shown valid in cases oftrauma or asphyxiation. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Pearls Hypothermia can mask symptoms and signs of other diseases. It is crucial tomeasure core temperature and considerassociated or alternative diagnoses. It cancause or mask an acute abdomen. Hypothermic patients can survive withoutcardiac activity. Contraindications to CPRinclude any sign of life, Do Not Resuscitate(DNR) status, or obvious lethal injuries.Dependent lividity, apparent rigor mortis, dilated pupils are not to CPR. A hypothermic patient with a normal hematocrit is likely anemic. Atrial dysrhythmias resolve with warmingand do not require treatment. Insulin is ineffective at temperatures /H1102130\u00b0C, as are most pharmacologic agents. IV fluids can be rewarmed in a microwaveoven. The bag should be shaken beforeadministration to prevent hot spots. Tympanic, oral, and bladder temperatures are unreliable. Pitfalls Failure to diagnose hypothermia by failing tomeasure core temperature. Failure to handle the hypothermic patientgently, which may precipitate VF. Failure to prevent further heat loss bycovering the patient, including the head and neck. Failure to diagnose traumatic injuriesresponsible for hypotension, tachycardia (relative to core temperature), or neurologicdysfunction. Being unaware that cardiac and other drugsare not absorbed well orally orintramuscularly, and are likely to remaininactive until rewarming occurs. Administration of room temperature or coldIV fluids or blood products. Administration of meperidine orphenothiazines, which abolish shivering. Myths The axiom \"No one is dead until they are warm and dead\" is a myth. The truth isthat some people are cold and dead. ABGs should be corrected for coretemperature. In fact, uncorrected ABGsshould be used to guide therapy. Hypothermia only occurs in cold climates.Hypothermia can occur under mildconditions both outdoors and indoors.

Hypothermia 632 Unique Issues in Emergency MedicineScope of the problem Lightning has been estimated to kill over 1000 people worldwide every year, although the num-ber of fatalities in developed countries has beendecreasing for the last 70-80 years. The deathrate in the US decreased from over 6 per millionto 0.4 per million annually during the twentiethcentury. At least 70% of lightning strikes are notfatal, but the majority of survivors experiencesignificant sequelae. Pathophysiology Lightning is a direct current that producesextremely high voltage for very brief durations.Unlike alternating current, the direct current oflightning often flows over the exterior of the body,referred to as flashover . However, it may enter the body with devastating results. Lightning produces injury by a number of different mechanisms : 1.Lightning may strike a person directly, whichis often fatal. 2.More frequently, current splashes fromnearby objects or people standing nearby;this is known as side flash . 3.Contact injury is produced when a person isin direct contact with an object that is hit orsplashed by lightning. 4.Step voltage or ground current causes injuryby flowing between two parts of the body incontact with the ground at different distancesfrom the lightning strike, due to the voltagedifference between these two points ofcontact. 5.Lightning can enter the body through themouth, ears, or orbits. 6.Blunt injury can occur from the shock waveproduced by lightning and the musclecontractions due to the current. Victims can be thrown a significant distance or can lose balance and fall. Pressure injuries, includ-ing tympanic membrane rupture, frequentlyoccur. Blunt injury o ccurs when falling or thrown objects hit the victim. Direct lightning injuries are due to high voltage; the secondary effects are due to heat production andexplosive force . Death is most commonly due to cardiorespiratory arrest. Respiratory arrest isoften prolonged due to paralysis of the respira-tory center in the medulla; this may lead tohypoxic cardiac arrest if not treated with ventila-tory support. High-voltage brain injury or blunthead trauma may also cause death. Other directinjuries include and a variety of neurologic conditions. In a lightning strike, the heart may stop instantly during myocardial depolarization, resulting in asys-tole. Cardiac activity usually resumes promptly, although it may be in jeopardy because of pro-longed res piratory arrest. Various ECG changes can be seen in lightning strikes, and myocardial infarction occasionally occurs. Hypertension is common, although it generally resolves within a few hours without treatment. Hypotension mayresult from traumatic hemorrhage. Neurologic injuries are often transient . Immediate injuries are typically transient, although they maybe fixed and severe. Temporary neurologic symp-toms include seizures, paralysis, deafness, blind-ness, confusion, amnesia, and coma. Temporaryparalysis of the extremities is called keraunoparal- ysis. It is due to intense vasospasm and usually clears within hours. Delayed injuries, which are likely progressive, include seizures, neuromus- cular disorders, ataxia, extremity weakness,paralysis, or chronic pain. All organ systems may be affected . Pulmonary, gas- trointestinal, and renal injuries may be immediateor delayed, and may be due to hypotension orother injuries. About half of lightning victims willhave eye injuries, most commonly cataracts. Thesemay be immediate or appear as long as 2 yearslater. Pupillary findings, including fixed, dilatedpupils, are common and often transient. Hearingloss, vertigo, and damage to the auditory system isalso seen. Over half of victims have tympanicmembrane rupture, which usually heals withoutintervention. Psychiatric sequelae are common. Burns are common . Burns are caused by the direct effects of lightning or by secondary heatproduction. Most direct burns are superficial,resulting from the rapid flashover effect. Burns also occur from vaporization of sweat or moisturein clothing, from melted synthetic clothing, and Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 633Lightning injuries LIGHTNING INJURIES Ken Zafren, MDfrom heated metal objects. The terms feathering and Lichtenberg figures are synonymous; these refer not to burns but to skin markings caused by electron shower, and ar e pathognomonic of light- ning injury (Figure 42.2). Entry and exit burns rarely occur. History The history in lightning injury is variable. On one hand, the history may be straightforwardwhen the strike is witnessed. On the other hand,lightning can strike \"out of the blue,\" at great dis-tance from a lightning storm, with the strike not witnessed. Victims are frequently amnestic of theevent. History obtained from witnesses mayprove helpful.Was the patient found outdoors or in a building not protected from lightning? Was a known lightning storm in the vicinity? Was it a hot, humid day when lightning was likely? In these circumstances, an unconscious or confused patient may have been a lightning strike victim. If the event was witnessed, what was the mechanism of injury? Was the patient struck directly, splashed, or affected by ground current? Did the patient fall, get struck by a falling object, or get thrown? Did the patient require resuscitation at the scene? If the patient required resuscitation from car- diorespiratory arrest, the prognosis is much worse. Did the patient lose consciousness or have any neurologic deficits that have resolved? The nature of the injuries and the time course of symptom resolution may provide clues to theseverity of delayed injuries. Past medical This is as important as it would be for any patientwith multiple injuries. Physical examination The main goal of the physical examination is toidentify direct and indirect injuries caused by alightning strike. In cases in which the mechanismof injury is uncertain, the physical examinationmay help identify lightning as the cause of thepatient's presentation. General appearance Victims with minor injuries are usually alert and seldom have burns. Confusion, combativeness,or coma indicate a greater degree of injury.Paralysis, especially of the legs, may also be seen.The patient may be seizing. Severely injured vic-tims may be in cardiac arrest. Signs of blunttrauma are common and should be identified. Vital signs Mildly injured victims will have normal vital signs or mild hyp ertension that resolves without treatment. Hypotension in a lightning victimshould prompt search for traumatic hemorrhage.

Courtesy : Sheryl Olson, RN, BSN.Head, eyes, ears, nose, throat and neck Burns on the head indicate severe injury. In addi- tion to signs of blunt trauma, tympanic membranerupture is a common finding. Blindness and deaf- ness are common and are often temporary.Various eye and ear injuries, especially tympanic membrane rupture, are frequent and mandatemore detailed examination. Hemotympanum andCSF otorrhea are signs of basilar skull fracture. Ifthere is any question of cervical spine injury, theneck should be stabilized during the physicalexamination. Skin The presence of feathering (Lichtenberg figures)is pathognomonic for lightning injury. Linearand punctate burns also provide evidence oflightning injury. Partial thickness burns maybecome more evident with time. Full thicknessburns may also occur. Abdomen Ileus may be present and may cause abdominaltenderness.Neurologic Mental status should be noted. It may be normalor the patient may be confused, combative, orcomatose. Amnesia is common. Pupillary find-ings are an nervefunction. may cause syndrome. Lower extremity keraunoparalysis is found two-thirds of severely injured patients;one-third have upper extremity keraunoparalysis.Paralysis of the extremities is the result of sympa-thetic stimulation with severe vasospasm. Theaffected limbs appear mottled and are cold to thetouch. They may be numb and pulseless. Spinalparalysis, paresis, dysfunction mayoccur. Hemiplegia been reported,and simulate a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Differential diagnosis Given a history of a lighting storm and witnessesto the strike, the diagnosis of lightning injury isstraightforward. Victims with feathering, or punc-tate or linear burns should be treated for light-ning injury.

These injuries, however, may be theresult of lightning even if a strike is not witnessed. Diagnostic testing Laboratory studies Testing will depend on the severity of injury and on associated clinical factors. Complete blood count Obtain a CBC for all patients with moderate or severe injury. Its main use is in the evaluation ofhemorrhage. Basic metabolic panel Obtain a BMP to assess renal injury or when elec- trolyte abnormalities are suspected. and urine myoglobin are indicated to rule out rhabdomy-olysis. Cardiac markers Cardiac markers are obtained in moderate to severe injury, when the ECG is abnormal, or thepatient complains of chest pain. Coagulation Coagulation studies should be ordered in mod- erate to severe injury to assess for DIC. Electrocardiogram An ECG should be obtained to assess for possiblecardiac injury. Prolongation of the QT interval isthe most frequent rhythm abnormality. Atrial fib-rillation, premature ventricular contractions, andventricular tachycardia have been reported.Elevation of the ST segment and T wave changesmay also be seen. Ischemic changes do not alwaysreflect vascular distribution patterns in lightning strike victims; areas of focal necrosis may be found.ECG changes may be delayed 24 hours or more. Radiologic studies Plain Films Achest X-ray (CXR) should be obtained to identify pulmonary injury or pneumothorax. Cervicalspine X-rays should be obtained in patients whose neck cannot be clinically cleared. Other plain films should be obtained based on suspected injuries. Computed tomography Head CT is indicated in patients with altered con- sciousness or those with suspected head injury. CTof the cervical spine is the optimal study in uncon-scious or multiple-injured patients. CT angiogra- phy of the chest and CT of the abdomen and pelvishave the same indications as in other patients,including those with suspected trauma. General treatment principles As with all patients, treatment begins with the ABCs. Lightning victims should be treatedaccording to cardiac and trauma care guidelines.Hypothermia, if present, should be addressed. Cardiovascular care Asystole and VF are seen more often in the fieldthan in the ED. Atrial fibrillation, premature ven-tricular contractions, and ventricular tachycardiamay occur. There is no evidence to differentiatetreatment of dysrhythmias due to lightninginjuries from those due to primary cardiac causes.Dysrhythmias may not occur until 24 hours afterthe injury. Premature ventricular contractionshave been reported up to 1 week later. Most dys-rhythmias resolve within days, but some may persist for months. Transient hypertension is therule and does not usually require treatment. Delayed hypertension has been reported up to 72hours after the injury. Persistent cases have beentreated with beta-blockers and other antihyper-tensive agents. Volume repletion All patients require IV access, but volume resus-citation is seldom necessary. Hypotensive patientsand those with extensive burns should receiveappropriate volume resuscitation. Most lightningburns are superficial and do not require specialtreatment. The presence of hypotension shouldprompt a search for a source of bleeding. Neurologic treatment Neurologic injuries are treated as in any traumapatient (including appropriate consultation),although some exceptions exist. Fixed, dilated pupils may be the result of local eye injury anddo not necessarily reflect CNS injury. Paralyzedextremities that are cool, mottled, and pulselessmay be observed, but the limb generally returnsto normal in a few hours once the vasospasmresolves. Fasciotomies are almost never needed in these cases. Miscellaneous injuries Eye injuries may include immediate or delayedcataracts. Ear injuries, such as tympanic membranerupture, usually heal spontaneously and do not require specific treatment. Any eye or ear injury resulting from lightning strike merits ophthal- mology or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) consult-ation. Ileus can occur and may require treatmentwith NG tube decompression. Special patients Pregnant Pregnant patients are not at increased risk formortality from lightning exposures, but fetaldeath occurs in about half of cases due to the highconductivity of amniotic fluid. Fetal ultrasoundand tocodynometry are mandatory after 20-weeks gestation. If the fetus is viable, the remain-der of the pregnancy is considered high-risk. Disposition Most experts believe that asymptomatic patientswith a normal ECG, including those with feath-ering, may be safely discharged after severalhours of observation. These patients need closefollow-up with neurology, ENT, and ophthal-mology, as delayed sequelae are common. Mildly injured patients who improve initially should be admitted for neurologic and cardiacmonitoring, with consultation from specialtyservices as indicated. Most lightning-injured patients should be admitted to a referral hospital with a full spectrumof consultative services. The trauma, neuro-surgery, cardiology, neurology, ENT, and oph-thalmology services are often consulted.Pregnant women beyond 20 weeks gestation willrequire admission for fetal ultrasound and a minimum of 4 hours of tocodynometric monitor-ing. The treatment for fetal demise is uterineevacuation.Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Pearls Apneic patients often survive withoutneurologic sequelae if ventilated adequatelyuntil spontaneous respirations resume.Cardiac activity usually resumes quickly ifthe patient is ventilated early and does notdevelop hypoxia. The amount of visible (external) damage doesnot always correlate well with the severity ofinternal injuries. Lightning current usually flows over thebody, but can also enter through variousorifices, including the eyes, ears, and mouth. Feathering (Lichtenberg figures) ispathognomonic of lightning injury. Punctate or linear burns suggest lightninginjury. Pitfalls Not resuscitating a lightning victim who hasfixed, dilated pupils. Not treating keraunoparalysis expectantly. Not considering the diagnosis of lightninginjury in a patient found comatose orconfused, given the appropriate conditions. Not looking for a source of bleeding in apatient with hypotension following lightninginjury. Not considering delayed and long-termsequelae, or providing appropriate specialtyfollow-up care. Treating a lightning victim like a patient with a high-voltage electrical injury. Large volumeresuscitation, fasciotomies and other aggressive treatments common in high-voltage injuries are almost never necessary inlightning injuries. Myths M ost lightning strikes are fatal. Lightning cannot strike inside a building. It is dangerous to touch a lightning victim. \"If you are not killed by lightning, you willbe okay.\" Lightning injury causes few permanentsequelae. Lightning victims may recover afterprolonged resuscitation because they are insuspended animation.

Lightning injuries 638 Unique Issues in Emergency MedicineNEAR-DROWNING Ken Zafren, MD Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 639Near-drowning Scope of the problem Drowning is defined as death by suffocation after submersion in water (or in another liquid). Near-drowning refers to survival, at least temporarily,following submersion. There is less agreementabout other terms, such as post-immersion syn-drome or secondary drowning, which refer tocomplications or death after near-drowning. Immersion syndrome is commonly used as a term for sudden death after submersion in verycold water. While this has traditionally beenexplained as being due to vagal stimulation caus-ing dysrhythmia, another phenomenon termed\"cold shock\" has been recognized. This refers toan involuntary gasp and hyperventilation whena victim is suddenly plunged into cold water.This can lead to aspiration of water and to rapid submersion. Drowning kills over 4500 people of all ages annually in the US, making it the fourth leadingcause of accidental death. More drownings occurin home swimming pools than in any other place.Toddlers have the highest risk of drowning, fol- lowed by teenage boys. Near-drowning is many times more common than drowning, but exact data are unavailable.One study estimated that there are 8000 hospital-izations and 31,000 ED visits annually for child-hood near-drowning in the US. Pathophysiology After submersion, alert victims hold their breathand may struggle or panic. Soon, respiratorydrive (\"air hunger\") causes an involuntary inspi-ration - gasping for breath. This results in aspira-tion of water, followed by convulsions and deathdue to hypoxemia. Some victims do not aspirate,but laryngospasm still causes hypoxemia anddeath. This has been termed dry drowning . In wet drowning , aspiration occurs. Although aspiration of fresh water and sea water cause essentially opposite changes in bloodvolume and electrolytes, only a small percentageof victims aspirate sufficient quantities of either tocause clinically-significant effects. However, aspi-ration of any amount of fresh or sea water causes pulmonary damage, which may result in non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Pulmonary injurymay be exacerbated by contaminants in the water,including bacteria, particulate matter, variouschemicals, and vomitus. Cerebral hypoxia alsomay cause non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Most patients will be acidemic. Initially, this is due to hypoventilation rather than lactic acidosissecondary to decreased tissue perfusion.Electrolyte abnormalities in near-drowning vic-tims seldom require treatment. Hypoxic-ischemic injury to the CNS cause neurologic sequelae in neurologic damage.Renal failure and coagulopathies, including DIC,may also occur. History History is important to establish the occurrenceof near-drowning, to identify a precipitatingevent(s), and to provide clues to associated con-ditions and potential complications. Did the patient have a coughing, choking, or vomiting episode near a pool or other body of water? This may be the only clue to a near-drowning incident. Is there a possible precipitating event that caused the near-drowning incident? Alcohol or other drug intoxication, head or neck injury, cardiac arrest, CVA, seizures, and hypother-mia are possible causes. Is the patient suicidal or a victim ofattempted homicide? Is there a possibility, inchildren, of neglect or non-accidental trauma?This may be a clue to associated conditions andpossible complications if the patient survives. Was the patient diving into the water or surfing? Is there another mechanism for potential head or neck trauma? If the history is unclear, the possibility of head and neck trauma should be considered.Was the patient scuba diving? This may be a clue to dysbaric injuries or cerebral air emboli. What were the water temperature and duration of submersion? This information will help guide resuscitation strategy. Submersion in water warmer than 20\u00b0C(68\u00b0F) and submersion longer than 5-10 minutesare predictors of increased mortality. Survivalhas not been reported in victims who have beensubmerged in warm water for over 30 minutes. Was the water clean or dirty? Near-drowning in dirty water has a worse prog- nosis and is more likely to lead to secondaryinfections. Past medical Underlying conditions such as a seizure disor-der, psychiatric illness, medications, and alcoholor other drug use may complicate the manage-ment of the near-drowning victim. Physical examination General appearance The patient may appear well or ill, and may beconscious or unconscious. The patient mayappear dyspneic and may be using accessorymuscles to breathe. Vital signs Core temperature should be measured. Tachypneamay provide a clue to pulmonary injury. Pulseand blood pressure, as well as respiratory rate,should be evaluated in relation to core tempera-ture. Shock is uncommon in near-drowning vic- tims; its presence mandates a search for other injuries. Pulmonary The chest may be clear or there may be wheezingor crackles. The absence of adventitial breathsounds does not rule out aspiration. Neurologic Patients arriving in the ED awake and alert havenearly 100% survival with normal neurologicstatus. Those with an altered level of conscious-ness yet arousable are also likely to survive with-out neurologic sequelae. Slightly less than half ofcomatose patients will survive without neuro-logic deficits, less than one-fourth will survivewith neurologic damage and the remainder willdie from hypoxic-ischemic brain injury or frompulmonary edema. Serial assessment of theGlasgow Coma Scale is mandatory. The remain-der of the neurologic examination should be guided by suspected illness or injury. Head-to-toe Athorough examination, such as that performed in any trauma victim or medical patient, shouldbe performed in order to identify associatedinjuries or conditions. Differential diagnosis Most cases of near-drowning will be clinicallyapparent by history and physical examination.

Toxidromes may Further studies may be present if toxic include head CT, lumbar exposure led to puncture near-drowningTable 42.4 Diagnostic possibilities in near-drowningDiagnostic testing Diagnostic testing is not needed in asymptomatic near-drowning patients. All other patients shouldundergo laboratory, ECG, and radiographic stud-ies as indicated by history and clinical findings. Laboratory studies Complete blood count CBC is likely to be normal or show leukocytosis. It is unlikely to change initial treatment, but maybe obtained as a baseline or as a clue to associ-ated conditions. Hemolysis can occur. Basic metabolic panel Electrolytes are likely to be normal. Abnormalities may indicate aspiration of large volumes ofwater, and will guide treatment. Metabolic acido-sis is a clue to tissue hypoxia. A low glucose mayhave caused an altered level of consciousnessleading to near-drowning. Renal failure some-times results from near-drowning. Coagulation profile This should be obtained in all patients with sig- nificant symptoms to rule out coagulopathies,especially DIC. Arterial blood gas Many authors advocate ABGs on all near-drown- ing patients. ABGs should be done on intubatedpatients, but their utility in spontaneously breath-ing patients is controversial. Most of the importantinformation can be obtained from observation ofthe patient, pulse oximetry, and serum bicarbon-ate. The decision to intubate should be made onclinical grounds. With the increasing availabilityof end-tidal CO 2monitoring and the universal availability of pulse oximetry, the use of ABGs isincreasingly less justifiable. Other studies Ordering a CK should be considered to rule out rhabdomyolysis. A UA is also commonly obtained and may demonstrate myoglobinuria,although this is not usually important in initialmanagement. A carbon monoxide level shouldbe obtained if there is a history of possible expo-sure, such as swimming under a houseboat. Blood levels of aspirin, acetaminophen, and other medications may be indicated based on the his-tory. Further laboratory testing should be dic- tated by the clinical situation and associated conditions that may be known or suspected. Electrocardiogram Most dysrhythmias will be clinically obviousand mandate an ECG. In a patient with signifi-cant dyspnea, chest pain, or history suggestingthe possibility of cardiovascular disease, an ECGis indicated to identify ischemia. All patientsrequiring supplemental oxygen due to hypox- emia need an ECG. Radiologic studies Chest X-ray ACXR should be obtained in all symptomatic near-drowning patients. The initial CXR may be normal, even in patients who later develop sig-nificant complications of aspiration. Other plain films Cervical spine films and other plain films should be obtained as indicated by the history or find-ings on physical examination. Computed tomography Head CT may be necessary if the possibility of head trauma exists. In near-drownings associ-ated with traumatic injury, CT of the cervicalspine, chest (CT angiography), and/or abdomenand pelvis may be indicated. General treatment principles Airway, Breathing, Circulation As with all emergency patients, treatment begins with the ABCs. Ventilation should be initiated inapneic patients. If ventilation is inadequate and theairway is clear, the patient should be intubated. Ifthe patient is conscious, non-invasive ventilatorysupport, such as nasal positive airwaypressure (CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pres-sure (BiPAP) are excellent alternatives. CPRshould be performed if the patient is pulseless,and should be continued until core temperatureis determined. If the core temperature is /H1102135\u00b0C, Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 641Near-drowningthe patient should be treated for hypothermia. In patients with core temperature 35\u00b0C or above,CPR is not likely to be successful if continuedfor/H1102230 minutes. Dysrhythmias and other circu- latory problems should be treated according toACLS and hospital protocols. Pulmonary management If there is significant pulmonary involvement,positive airway pressure is generally necessary.Steroids and prophylactic antibiotics are not help-fulafter aspiration, although some authors rec- ommend antibiotics if near-drowning occurred inhighly contaminated water. Antibiotics are indi-cated for patients with signs of infection. Intubatedpatients should have a NG tube placed to decom-press the stomach. Neurologic management Supportive care, with care to avoid hypotensionand hypoxemia, is the key to managing patientswith neurologic abnormalities. Associated conditions Associated injuries and conditions should beidentified and treated appropriately as in otherpatients. Special patients Pediatric Infants and children have demonstrated longersurvival than adults in cold water near-drown-ing. The possibility of child abuse or neglectshould be addressed with appropriate consulta-tion and reporting, according to state law. Thepsychological effects on families should be con-sidered when children experience near-drowning, with appropriate referrals given for mental healthresources. Disposition Historically, all near-drowning victims wereadmitted and monitored. The current approachto admission for near-drowning is more selective.Patients clearly without significant symptomsprior to arrival do not require diagnostic studiesand can generally be discharged after a brief periodof observation. Family, social, and psychiatricissues should be addressed prior to discharge. If there is any question about the history, if the patient has mild symptoms, or if the patientis a young child, pulse oximetry and a CXR areindicated. If these are normal, the patient shouldbe observed for a minimum of 4 hours. Thesepatients can be discharged if they remain asymp-tomatic, can be watched closely at home, andhave the means to r eturn if necessary. Patients with mild hypoxemia, those who re main sympto- matic after observation, or those who develop respiratory symptoms should be admitted to a regular medical bed. Patients who are intubated and mechanically-ventilated r equire critical care unit admission. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Pearls Near-drowning in cold water ( /H1102120\u00b0C) is associated with better survival than near-drowning in warm water. Patients in coma or who arrive in the EDwithout vital signs may surviveneurologically intact. Initial CXR may be normal, even in patientswith pulmonary injury. In near-drowning patients who are nothypothermic, CPR ongoing for /H1102230 minutes is unlikely to result in successfulresuscitation. Pitfalls Failure to consider the cause of near-drowning, such as trauma (especially of the head or cervical spine), drugintoxication, hypoglycemia, cardiac arrest, or CVA. Failure to address the possibility of non-accidental causes, such as suicide, homicide,child abuse or neglect. Failure to rewarm a hypothermic near-drowning victim. Myths Most drowning victims swallow largeamounts of water leading to electrolyteabnormalities. The Heimlich maneuver is helpful in near-drowning victims without foreign bodyairway obstruction. All near-drowning victims require admission. Near-drowning 642 Unique Issues in Emergency MedicineReferences 1.Feldhaus KM. Submersion. In: Marx JA (ed.).

Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 643Near-drowningScope of the problem In 2001 there were /H1102285,000 calls to US poison control centers regarding bites and stings. While the majority of these injuries can be handled withsimple first aid alone, a number of victims willpresent to the emergency department (ED) forcare. Presentations can be for acute systemic tox-icity due to venom poisoning, local woundsapparently inflicted by a venomous creature, oranaphylactic reactions in a sensitized individual. The venomous creatures exacting the greatest toll in terms of human injury include the arthro-pods, especially the hymenoptera or stinginginsects (bees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, andfire ants), a handful of spider species, scorpions,and the venomous reptiles, particularly snakes. The major impact of hymenoptera is seen in the 0.3-3.0% of the human population that isdangerously allergic to these insects and at riskof anaphylaxis if stung. The vast majority ofdeaths related to venomous creatures in the USare due to hymenoptera-induced anaphylaxis.The spiders of major consequence include thewidow spiders ( Latrodectus species) (Figure 42.3) which are found throughout much of the world,the brown spiders ( Loxosceles species, the bestknown of which is the brown recluse, L. reclusa ) (Figure 42.4), and the Australian funnel-web spi-ders ( Atrax and Hadronyche species). Scorpions are of limited medical importance in the US with onlyone potentially dangerous species ( Centruroides exilicauda ), but they are much more important in other regions of the world, particularly Centraland South America, Africa and the Middle East.In Mexico, for example, scorpions take a highertoll in terms of human mortality than do ven-omous snakes. The most dangerously venomousscorpions families Viperidae (subfamilies Viperinae (vipers) and Crotalinae (pit vipers)) (Figure 42.5), Elapidae(including cobras, mambas, coral snakes, and allof the venomous snakes of Australia) andHydrophidae (sea snakes). There are a few speciesof snakes in the family Colubridae that have sali-vary secretions that can be ), both of Africa). The remainder of this family is largely harmless. There are two venomous species of lizards, the Terrestrial venomous bites and stings 644 Unique Issues in Emergency MedicineTERRESTRIAL VENOMOUS BITES AND STINGS Robert L. Norris, MD Figure 42.3 Black widow spider ( Latrodectus species). Note the characteristic central hourglass. Courtesy: Michael Cardwell. Figure 42.4Brown recluse spider H. horridum ), but bites by these species are quite rar e unless an attempt is made to pick up the animal. Venomous lizards will not be discussed in this chapter. Anatomic essentials The venomous creatures discussed in this chapter all produce venoms in specialized glands, anddeliver these venoms using sophisticatedanatomic structures (such as fangs or stingers) totheir victims or prey. These venoms are complexand lead to various local and/or systemicderangements depending on the species involved.Abrief overview of the major venom types and characteristic clinical sequelae is found in Tables42.5 and 42.6. One should keep in mind that ven-oms can vary not only between species, but alsobetween individuals within a species, and thatvenoms affect different individuals in differentways. Therefore, a physician tasked with manag-ing a victim of venomous bite or sting must bevigilant for atypical presentations and sequelae.

Brown spiders Sphingomyelinase D - may producedermonecrosis and hemolysis Widow spiders Alpha latrotoxin - a spider Atratoxin or robustoxin - neurotoxins found indifferent species Scorpions These venoms are quite variable in different species Most toxic scorpions contain neurotoxic components Many species contain serotonin (increases pain) Snake venoms Very complex Viperids (vipers and pit vipers) Components can effect essentially any body system Among the most deleterious fractions are low-molecular weight components that cause cellularmembrane and intercellular disruption (responsible for tissue destruction) Most viperid venoms contain components that cancause systemic coagulopathy (due to affects onthe coagulation cascade at various sites) Elapids Many of these venoms possess significantneurotoxicity, which can cause death due torespiratory depression Some species have components that cause severetissue necrosis (e.g., most spitting cobras) Hydrophids (sea snakes) Neurotoxicity Myotoxicity Colubrids Most species in this family are completely harmless A few species can envenom humans with toxicsecretions from a special salivary gland (Duvernoy'sgland). These secretions are hemorrhagicTable 42.5 Overview of venoms of major groups of terrestrial creaturesHistory What was the offending animal? It is easiest to manage a victim of a venomous bite or sting if the animal that inflicted the injurycan be identified. Often this is easy, particularly ifthe creature was seen and can be accuratelydescribed (or if it was killed and brought with thepatient). More than 50% of venomous snakebitesin the US occur to people who are intentionallyhandling the animal, making identification morestraightforward in this situation. In some cases,identification of the offending animal can be dif-ficult or impossible. A good example of this is thebite of the brown recluse spider, which is ofteninitially painless and the victim does not presentfor hours or days until local ischemic pain beginsor a necrotic lesion develops. How long before presentation did the bite(s) or sting(s) occur? Some bites, such as venomous snakebites, usu- ally prompt the victim to seek medical carepromptly. On the other hand, a victim of somespider bites may not present for hours to daysafter envenomation. What prehospital management measures were tried? Anumber of first aid techniques for venomous bites or stings may be instituted by well-meaning Terrestrial venomous bites and stings 646 Unique Issues in Emergency MedicineHymenoptera stings Typical local reaction: initial pain, followed by itching wheal or hive limited to the sting site. Exaggerated local response: pain and itching that progress over many hours to days to involve the entire extremity. Anaphylaxis: a spectrum of diffuse hives, wheezing, laryngeal edema, hypotension, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and possibly death. Spider bites Species capable of inflicting a bite through human skin: pain, a local papule that may develop a small escharwhich heals over a period of days. Widow spiders :bite felt as a pinprick, gradual onset of muscle pain and cramping in the involved extremity (which may spread to the trunk, resulting in respiratory distress or a rigid abdomen) which progress for several hours andmay persist for 72 hours; associated nausea, vomiting, sweating, headache (possibly due to elevated bloodpressure or intracranial bleeding), rapid heart rate or palpitations. Brown spiders :bite is usually painless; delayed onset of pain due to ischemia at the bite site; ischemic tissue develops an ulcer which may be progressive and, in rare cases, become severe, undermining normal skin andcreating a necrotic \"volcano lesion\"; rarely, systemic poisoning can present with flu-like symptoms (fever, nausea,vomiting, etc.) with acute hemolysis and potential development of renal failure. Funnel-web spiders :severe pain, perioral tingling, muscle fasciculations, diaphoresis, lacrimation, tachycardia, pulmonary edema, and respiratory distress. Scorpion stings Non-neurotoxic scorpions (e.g., most US species): initial intense pain that passes quickly; possibly mild soft tissueswelling and local bruising; anaphylaxis is rare. Neurotoxic changes; restlessness, roving eye movements, salivation, respiratory distress, opisthotonus/emprosthotonus (may mimic seizures), elevated blood pressure. Snakebites Viperids :most cause local soft tissue swelling and pain within minutes of the bite; pain may be severe and swelling may progress over hours to involve the entire extremity and even the trunk; ecchymosis; over time, necrosis of local tissues; systemic findings may include nausea, vomiting, muscle fasciculations, altered tastesensations, weakness, bleeding (from almost any anatomic site) and shock. Elapids :most can cause neurotoxicity with resulting muscle weakness (generally starting with the muscles of the head and neck innervated by cranial nerves - ptosis, diplopia, difficulty swallowing) that may progress toperipheral paralysis and respiratory failure; cardiovascular instability may also occur; onset of signs or symptomsof venom poisoning may be extremely rapid or may be delayed many hours. Hydrophids :primary findings included neurotoxic symptoms and signs similar to elapids as well as pain related to myotoxicity. Colubrids :most of these species are completely harmless and bites result in no more pain that would be expected from multiple tiny pinpricks; bites by the dangerous boomslang or twig snake can cause systemic hemorrhage.Table 42.6 Descriptions of clinical syndromes that can be anticipated after bites/stings of venomous terrestrial creatures\"rescuers.\" Many such measures are of no value. Some may even be worse than the bite or stingitself. For most arthropod envenomations, iceapplication to and elevation of the affected bodypart are adequate first-aid therapies. It is diffi-cult, however, to make broad recommendationsfor snakebites beyond getting the victim to med-ical care as soon as possible. Little definitiveresearch has been done on field management approaches for snakebite. Ice should be avoidedin venomous snakebite, as additional cold injurycan worsen local venom-induced tissue damage.One technique demonstrated to delay absorptionof a number of snake venoms is the Australianpressure immobilization technique. The victim'sentire bitten extrem ity is wrapped firmly (at pres- sures similar to those used for wrapping a sprained ankle), beginning at the bite site, andthe limb is then splinted. Use of this technique insituations where necrosis is unlikely to occur fol- lowing the bite, as with many elapid venoms, appears prudent. Use in situations where tissueloss may be compounded by limiting venomstrictly to the site, as with most viperid venoms,may be unwise unless the victim is a great dis-tance from medical care and has suffered a life-threatening bite. Techniques to avoid includeapplication of electric shocks, incision and suc-tion, use of tourniquets, and application of top-ical poultices, such as meat tenderizer. What is the victim's tetanus status? Since any bite or sting results in a break in the skin with concomitant tetanus risk, adequateimmunization status should be ensured andupdated as indicated. Past medical Co-morbid conditions such as heart or lung dis-ease may make the overall envenomation syn-drome worse. Prior history of a bite or sting by asimilar creature may be important if the victimsuffered an allergic reaction to the injury or ifantivenom therapy was required. Victims suffer-ing an anaphylactic reaction to a hymenopterasting who are currently on beta-blocker therapyare much more difficult to treat, and may berefractory to epinephrine treatment (Chapter 11). Physical examination When approaching a victim of severe venom poi-soning, it is best to conduct a rapid, focused initialexamination while simultaneously beginning life-saving treatment (e.g., epinephrine administra-tion to a victim of anaphylaxis). Once treatment is underway, a more thorough examination shouldbe performed. General appearance Check for any evidence of cardiac or respiratorydistress, including airway involvement. Vital signs These can be quite variable depending on theenvenomation syndrome. Hymenoptera sting with anaphylaxis : The victim may have a rapid heart rate, low blood pressure,and rapid respiratory rate. In a preterminal state,the heart rate may begin to fall and blood pres-sure may be unobtainable. Spider bites and scorpion stings : When neurotoxic species are involved, blood pressure, heart rate,and respiratory rate may be elevated. Occasionallythe temperature will also be mildly elevated.Following most arthropod poisonings, however,the vital signs will be normal. Snakebite : Vital signs are variable. A victim of elapid or seasnake bite may present with adecreased respiratory rate (due to neurotoxic lossof respiratory muscle function). Viperid bite vic-tims often have an elevation in respiratory rate,heart rate and blood pressure (often due to accom-panying anxiety), but may present, in severe poi- soning, with vital signs consistent with shock dueto venous pooling, third spacing, and hemolysis. Pulmonary Listen for quality and regularity of cardiac soundsand for adventitial lung sounds. In severe scor-pion, widow spider or snake envenomation, thevictim may develop pulmonary edema withaccompanying rales on lung examination. Abdomen The abdominal examination is rarely revealing.Occasionally, with widow spider bites, the victimwill complain of severe abdominal pain and willhave what appears to be severe guarding. Thishas led to negative exploratory laparotomies incases where a history of spider bite was notavailable. Widow spider venom-induced rectusabdominis spasm can, however, be differentiatedfrom peritonitis by the lack of rebound followingspider bite and by the fact that these victims tend Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 647Terrestrial venomous bites and stingsto be restless, unable to find a position of com- fort, unlike patients with acute peritonitis whoprefer to lie as still as possible. A rectal examin-ation should be performed to assess for occultblood in the setting of viperid snakebite. Neurologic Acareful examination focusing on cranial nerve (CN) function (particularly CNs II through VII)and motor function (including respiratory effortas well as peripheral muscle strength) is impor-tant when the patient has been bitten or stung byan organism with neurotoxic venom (e.g., elapidsnakebite or neurotoxic scorpion sting). Skin Aclose evaluation of the bite/sting site is impor- tant. Any retained bee stings (commonly referredto as \"stingers\") can be scraped away. There maybe diffuse urticaria if the victim is experiencing anallergic reaction to the venom. Spider bites maypresent with minimal local findings (e.g., widowspider bites) or may have significant necrosis(e.g., severe brown spider bites). Scorpion stingsusually have few local findings (possibly somemild soft tissue swelling or bruising at the site fol-lowing non-neurotoxic scorpion stings). Forsnakebites, the bitten extremity may demonstratepuncture wounds (though the bite pattern can bemisleading), ecchymosis, and soft tissue swelling(Figure 42.6). The extremity should be marked attwo or more sites proximal to the bite, and cir-cumferences measured at these points every 15minutes to help gauge progression of the poison-ing until it is clear that the victim has stabilized.Lymphatic Many arthropod and snake venoms are absorbedvia the lymphatic system and may initiate animpressive lymphangitis. Regional lymph nodesdraining a bitten extremity should be assessedfor tenderness and lymphadenopathy. Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis is usually straightfor-ward in cases of venomous bites and stings. Oftenthe victim will have witnessed the creature thatinflicted the injury and be able to describe (oractually produce) it. If a snake is brought in withthe patient, it should be evaluated cautiously, aseven a dead snake or a decapitated snake headcan have a bite reflex for up to 1 hour after beingkilled and can still render a serious bite. Arriving at a diagnosis can be more difficult in cases of delayed presentation of possible spiderbite when no spider was seen. In this scenario, thevictim usually presents with a painful, swollen, red papule with or without an area of central necrosis. Such a lesion can indeed be caused by aspider, but is more likely the result of a bite froma flea, tick, bedbug or other arthropod. It also maybe caused by a non-arthropod source, such as aninfected plant puncture wound, or a localresponse to a systemic illness (e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema nodosum, or diabetic ulcer). Diagnostic testing Laboratory studies In most envenomation cases, laboratory studiesare not necessary. There are very few diagnosticstudies available to aid medical care providerstreating victims of bites or stings. In Australia, anenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit is avail-able to aid in identifying the offending species insuspected snakebites. These kits detect venom inwound aspirate, serum, or urine. The following laboratory studies may be help- ful in certain cases (Table 42.7). Radiologic studies Chest X-ray Achest radiograph should be obtained in an envenomation syndrome whenever there are signs of respiratory distress, or if the victim has signifi-cant cardiorespiratory comorbidity. Terrestrial venomous bites and stings 648 Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine Figure 42.6 Rattlesnake bite to the distal index finger. Note theswelling, hemorrhagic blebs, and bloody discharge.Electrocardiogram An ECG should be obtained in an envenomation syndrome whenever the poisoning is severe, thereare significant comorbidities, or the patient haschest pain or shortness of breath. General treatment principles Treatment may need to begin before a precise diagnosis is made, as in the case of a victim of arthropod-induced anaphylaxis. Any restrictive clothing or jewelry should be removed as soon aspossible. Patients presenting to an ED for evaluation of a possible envenomation syndrome can be dividedinto two major groups. The first, and most com- mon, is the clearly stable victim of a bite or stingwho is concerned about possible complications(e.g., a victim who presents with a painful papulethat might be a spider bite). The second is thepotentially unstable victim of an acute enveno-mation that may be progressing (e.g., a venomoussnakebite victim).In the first type of patient, treatment is directed at trying to limit complications of the bite or sting.This involves supportive, conservative care includ- ing sound wound care (cleansing, dressing, splint-ing, and tetanus immunization as appropriate)and symptomatic treatment (e.g., antihistaminesfor itching). If signs or symptoms of secondaryinfection occur, the patient should receive appro-priate antibiotics with good Staphylococcus cover- age. If a brown spider bite is suspected, local icetreatment (every few hours over the course of2-3 days) may be beneficial in slowing the action of venom enzymes. Ice should, however , be avoided in venomous snakebites due to the riskof compounding necrosis. If the victim has anysystemic symptoms, laboratory studies shouldbe obtained as outlined above (Table 42.7). For potentially unstable patients (e.g., victim of serious widow spider bite, neurotoxic scor-pion sting, or venomous snakebite), attentionmust first be directed at ensuring adequacy ofthe ABCs, in that order. Airway managementmust be aggressive if the patient was bitten by anelapid snake and presents with any evidence ofrespiratory depression or difficulty swallowing secretions. Oxygen should be started and cardiac Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 649Terrestrial venomous bites and stings Complete blood count (CBC) Suspected brown spider bite with systemic (flulike) symptoms :to rule out hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. Venomous snakebite :to obtain a baseline hematocrit (in case the victim develops coagulopathy with systemic bleeding or hemolysis); the white blood cell (WBC) count is often elevated (without any secondary infection). Electrolytes, renal function studies, and creatine kinase Suspected brown spider bite with systemic symptoms or any abnormalities on the CBC :to rule out renal dysfunction. Venomous snakebite :to rule out significant rhabdomyolysis or renal insufficiency .Sea snakes (and some viperids and elapids) can cause significant rhabdomyolysis with resulting hyperkalemia, myoglobinemia, myoglobinuria, and complicating renal failure. In these cases, a serum myoglobin and CK should also be measured. Coagulation profile Venomous snakebite and presumed brown spider bite with suspected systemic toxicity :a serum sample should be sent for measurement of prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, Inter national Normalized Ratio (INR), fibrinogen level, and fibrin degradation products to assess for possib le consumptive coagulopathy. Blood type and screen Venomous snakebite :to allow for cross-matching of blood in the rare event that coagulopathy or hemolysis mandates the need for transfusion. Both circulating snake venom and any adminis tered antivenom can interfere with cross-matching as time progresses. Presumed brown spider bite with suspected systemic toxicity :to prepare for transfusion if needed to treat hemolysis or thrombocytopenia. Urinalysis Venomous snakebite or presumed brown spider bite :point of care testing should be done on each voided specimen during the acute phase of poisoning to detect hematuria or myoglobinuria.Table 42.7 Laboratory testing for terrestrial venomous bites and stingsand pulse oximetry monitoring instituted. Two large bore IV lines with normal saline should bestarted if there is any evidence of hemodynamicinstability. If the blood pressure is low or thepatient is significantly tachycardic, a bolus of IVfluid should be administered (20-40 ml/kg in achild; 500-1000 ml in an adult depending on thepatient's cardiovascular reserve). It must be determined whether an appropriate antivenom exists for the current envenomationsyndrome, and whether or not it is necessary andavailable. Antivenoms exist for most of theworld's venomous snakes, for widow spiders,and for some funnel-web spiders and scorpions.Antivenom choice is important, particularly whendealing with a venomous snakebite, as there isgenerally little benefit to using an antivenomproduced for a remotely-related or unr elated species. For example, in North America, there would be no benefit in using a pit viper antivenomin treating a victim of coral snake bite. Conversely,widow spider antivenom is effective regardlessof which Latrodectus species inflicted the bite. There are no commercially-available antivenomsoutside of South America for brown spiders. Antivenom is generally indicated if the victim demonstrates evidence of significant poisoningor evidence of progression. As not all hospitalscarry all available antivenoms even againstlocally indigenous venomous creatures, a searchfor a source of the appropriate antiserum shouldbegin early. Particularly in cases of bites by exoticspecies, poison control centers, or local or regionalzoos may need to be consulted for assistance inlocating antivenom. Most antivenoms are produced by injecting horses or sheep with gradually increasing doses ofthe venom or venoms of interest. Once the animalhas developed immunity to the venom(s), anti-body laden serum is obtained, pr ocessed, puri- fied (to variable degrees) and packaged, often in a lyophilized form. Many recently developedantivenoms are pr oduced using technology to cleave the antibodies into the functional Fabfrag- ments and the deleterious Fcfragments (which are discarded). These antibody fragment productstend to be more effective and safer to use thanwhole antibody products. Administration of any antivenom (route, dose, timing) should be according to specific instruc-tions in the package insert for the product chosen. The initial volume needed can vary froma single, 10-ml vial of widow spider antivenom, to six or more vials of rattlesnake antivenom.Additional doses may be required if signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities progressor recur. Antivenoms should be administered in an unbitten extremity whenever possible inorder to ensure adequate systemic distribution. Since all antivenoms are currently derived from heterologous animal serums, they carry some riskof adverse reactions. These reactions can take theform of acute anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reac-tions, or (which generallypresents 1-2 weeks following antivenom admin-istration with symptoms such as hives, fever,myalgias, and arthralgias). Fortunately, withrecent improvements in purification techniques, these reactions are becoming less common. Antibiotics are usually not necessary for the treatment of venomous bites or stings, andshould be reserved for cases with suspected sec-ondary bacterial infection. Additional treatment Potential brown spider bites : If local necrosis is severe, these victims may require judiciousdebridement and/or skin grafting. Skin graftsshould be delayed for 4-6 weeks to allow resolu-tion of any ongoing venom effects. Some expertsbelieve the use of dapsone (a polymorphonu-clear leukocyte inhibitor) may reduce the extentof necrosis following these bites. While theore-tically and anecdotally of value, dapsone is notapproved for this purpose and has significantdose-dependent side effects, making its use con-troversial. Likewise, research results have beenmixed on the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO)therapy to limit necrosis. If readily available andeasily accessed, HBO can be tried for particularlysevere wounds. Widow spider bites : A combination of benzodi- azepines and narcotic analgesics is useful in themanagement of severe pain, muscle spasms andagitation often seen with this envenomation syndrome. Calcium gluconate, while mentioned anecdotally by some authors, is of little or no benefit in the management of widow spidervenom poisoning. Venomous snakebites : Bites by viperid snakes often produce severe soft tissue swelling of theinvolved extremity. This swelling is usuallyrestricted to the subcutaneous tissues, but, in rare cases, can occur within muscle compartments,resulting in possible compartment syndrome. Differentiating a compartment syndrome fromsevere, subcutaneous swelling without vascularcompromise requires direct intracompartmentalpressure measurement using a wick catheter, a Terrestrial venomous bites and stings 650 Unique Issues in Emergency Medicineneedle and transducer, or a Stryker device. If pres- sures found to be elevated ( /H1102230-40 mmHg), further antivenom should be administered whilethe limb is kept strictly ele vated. If the victim's hemodynamic status is stable, a dose of IV manni- tol (an osmotic diuretic) can be given in an effortto help reduce the intracompartmental pressure. Ifthe pressure remains elevated over the next hour despite these treatments, a fasciotomy is requiredto ensure sustained blood flow to the muscles. Special patients As a general principle, victims at each end of theage spectrum may suffer more severe venompoisoning syndromes. Pediatric patients tend toreceive the same venom load as an adult would when bitten or stung, yet they have less bodymass and circulating volume to buffer thevenom's ef fects. In situations where antivenom is required, pediatric doses meet or exceed those for adults due to this relatively greater venomload-to-body mass ratio. Elderly patients, like-wise, may be more prone to severe venom effectsin the face of comorbid conditions, and should betreated aggressively. Disposition Victims who are clearly stable following a bite or sting can usually be discharged from the ED afteran appropriate period of observation (generally6-8 hours). A symptomatic victim of hymenopterasting who is worried about development of ana-phylaxis (possibly due to a prior episode of ana- phylaxis following bee sting), can be observedfor at least 2 hours in the ED and dis charged if asymptomatic. Victims of hymenoptera stingswho experience a systemic reaction more severethan simple diffuse urticaria or mild bron-chospasm should be admitted for observation,preferably to a monitored setting. Any patientwho has experienced an anaphylactic reactionshould, at the time of discharge from the hospital,receive a prescription for a self-administration epinephrine device, instructions to obtain a Medic-Alert medallion, and referral to an allergist forevaluation. Patients who present with potential brown spider bites can be discharged for daily woundchecks (for 3 days) if they have no systemic find-ings (fever, flu-like symptoms). If systemic abnor-malities are present (as manifested by signs,symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities), thesepatients should be admitted for IV fluids andmonitoring for development of severe hemolysisand potential renal failure. Victims bitten by a venomous snake who have no evidence of venom poisoning should beobserved for at least 6 hours. If they remainasymptomatic and have normal laboratory testsand vital signs at 6 hours, they can be safely dis-charged with instructions to return if delayedsigns or symptoms of envenomation appear. Anexception to this 6 hours guideline exists if thebiting snake was an elapid, due to the potentialdelay in onset of findings of venom poisoning. Inthese cases, victims should be admitted for 24hours of observation. Any snakebite victim withsigns or symptoms of envenomation should beadmitted to the hospital. The patient should be ina monitored setting during any antivenomadministration. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths There are few topics in medicine as impacted bymyths and folklore as the treatment of venomousbites and stings. Many anecdotal \"remedies\" stillreceive attention, particularly related to venomous snakebites. These include application of variouspoultices, use of extreme heat, incision and suc-tion, electric shock therapy, and others. The keys to managing any acute envenoma- tion syndrome are to be a keen observer, antici-pate multisystem involvement, and promptlyrequest specialty consultation from a regional expert or poison control center. The major pitfalls in managing envenoma- tions lie in: performing an inadequate evaluation (particularly regarding the history and physical examination); failure to periodically reassess the victim forprogression of venom poisoning; failing to recognize the importance ofabnormal vital signs; failing to aggressively secure the airway in a patient developing respiratoryinsufficiency; failing to secure and administer antivenom,when indicated, in a timely fashion; premature discharge of a victim of venom poisoning when the onset of systemicfindings may be delayed (e.g., a victim ofelapid snake bite); Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 651Terrestrial venomous bites and stingsdiagnosing any lesion as a \"brown (recluse) spider bite\" in the absence of confirmatoryevidence; failure to evaluate a victim of possible brownspider bite with systemic symptoms forhemolysis or renal insufficiency; discharging a patient without appropriatefollow-up and after-care instructions (e.g.,failure to prescribe an epinephrine self-administration kit and referral to an allergistfor a victim of hymenoptera-inducedanaphylaxis); failure to administer tetanus immunizationwhen indicated, though these wounds can beconsidered to be at low risk for tetanusunless secondary infection occurs; failure to suspect compartment syndromeand objectively measure intracompartmentalpressures in a victim of viperid bite withsevere extremity swelling; failure to seek early specialty consultationwhen needed.

The rapid deteriorationof such patients often prohibits lengthy deliber-ations about ethical dilemmas. Emergency phys-icians must possess a practical understanding ofmedical ethics in order to address these cases in athorough and efficient manner. Terminology Modern philosophy links the definitions of moral-ity and ethics. In the simplest forms, morality is the difference between right and wrong, while ethics represents the critical study of morality. Indi- viduals choose from a variety of sources of moralauthority, such as religion, cultural norms, pol-itics, and law. As such, persons may regard situ-ations or objects differently, based on the valuesystems espoused by their source of moral guid-ance. Ethics represents the cognitive evaluation ofa principle or situation, acknowledging the factthat individuals possess different moral back-grounds. Ethical dilemmas arise when there is aconflict of values between persons arguing forcompeting moral imperatives - when people can-not agree on what is right and what is wrong. Medical ethics is a discipline that studies differ- ences in value systems as they apply to clinicalsituations. Medical ethics is most commonlytaught through classroom discussion, as a meansto familiarize providers with common ethicalprinciples. Applied health care ethics is the practical extension of such discussion, recognizing thatlike all clinical decision-making, ethical dilem-mas require action. The word \"applied\" then refersto the reality that physicians mediate ethicaldilemmas and make tough decisions every day.They are not philosophers, but practitioners ofmedical philosophy. Ethical theories Most American physicians guide their ethicaldecision-making from duty-based conceptsknown as the \"principles of biomedical ethics.\"These principles include respect for autonomy,non-malfeasance, beneficence and justice. Respect for autonomy is demonstrated when the patient is given the ability to exhibit self-governance, orself-determination. Patients should be allowed tomake choices regarding their own health care.Non-malfeasance is loosely translated into the statement \"do no harm.\" Physicians have an eth-ical obligation to limit the risks of poor outcomesthat may result from diagnostic or therapeuticinterventions. Beneficence in health care refers to the fundamental challenge to optimize a patient'scondition and well-being; this may be throughtreatment of disease or provision of comfort care.Justice refers to the fair and equal treatment of patients, both in access to and quality of healthcare. Justice is also manifest through systems andinstitutional ethics, which in today's marketplacemust respond to the reality of limited health careresources. Acompeting, but no less valid ethical theory is that of virtue ethics. Defined in medieval times,the virtues were those character traits that shaped professional ethics in medicine for many centuries.Among the most critical markers of character forthe virtuous physician were fidelity, trust, com-passion, temperance, integrity, prudence, justiceand self-effacement. For patients, the virtues oflove (of something, such as health or life) andfaith (that life can continue or health be restored)translate into the modernly-accepted virtue of hope. These latter virtues serve as the basis ofvalue systems employed by some critically-illpatients and their families, and as such, shouldbe considered when making ethical decisions. Making ethical decisions As mentioned, the pace with which emergencyphysicians must make clinical and ethical deci-sions does not allow for extended discussions ofethical theory. Instead, physicians can benefitfrom a practiced, step-wise approach to ethicaldecision-making. First, one must recognize thatan ethical dilemma exists. Next, the physicianmust choose an ethical framework to guide thedeliberation process in an organized manner.43 Ethics and end-of-life issues Michael A. Gisondi, MDEthics and end-of-life issues 654 Unique Issues in Emergency MedicineFinally, an action must be chosen and one's rea- soning reflected in the medical record. Recognizing the ethical dilemma Ethical dilemmas must be recognized and charac-terized. They result from conflicts between valuesor the interpretation of values by patients, theirfamilies, physicians, staff, the hospital, society,the law and others. Once physicians recognizethat tensions exist, the ethical conflict should becharacterized as simply as possible. \"Mrs. X is in respiratory failure. Her daughter wants her intubated, despite a valid 'do-not-resuscitate' order in the patient'schart. The daughter's wishes (hope, beneficence) are atconflict with the physician's obligation to his patient(prudence, respect for autonomy).\" Choosing an ethical framework An ethical framework differs from a theory orCode of Conduct in that it represents a system-atic, step-wise approach to addressing ethicaldilemmas. It may be impractical for the physi-cian to work through a detailed framework in anemergent situation, but familiarization with thesteps of a given framework will make criticaldecisions proceed more smoothly. Two such ethical frame works are included for considera- tion: Thomasma's \"Ethical Problems.\" The ethical workup guide (David C. Thomasma, PhD. 1978) Step 1: What are the facts in the case?Mrs. X is in respiratory failure following a long pro- gression of lung cancer. She has had ample time toconsider the details of her living will, and apparentlymade an authentic choice to decline intubation. Herdaughter has been estranged from her for many years,but now asks for \"more time\" in order to reconcile theirdifferences. Step 2: What are the values at risk in the case? The daughter exhibits the virtue of hope. The phys- ician realizes the futility of prolonging his patient'sdeath. The daughter is also genuinely beneficent, inthat she believes intubation is the optimal treatmentfor her dying mother. The physician has a duty torespect his patient's autonomous choice to decline life- saving procedures .Step 3: Determine the conflicts between valuesand professional norms, and between ethicalaxioms, rules, and principles. At conflict are the daughter's beneficent hope and the physician's prudence and duty to respect his patient'sautonomy. Step 4: Determine possible courses of action, and which values and ethical principles eachcourse of action would protect or infringe. Intubation might temporarily extend the patient's life, in accordance with the daughter's wishes. Non-invasivemechanical ventilation such as bilevel positive airwaypressure (BiP AP) would be an option more respectful of the patient's wishes and the physician's obligationto his patient. Step 5: Make a decision in the case. Non-invasive ventilation instead of intubation. Step 6: Defend this course of action. Why is \"x\" better than \"y\"? Respect for patient autonomy is more important than the perceived beneficence of the daughter's wishes. Onemight also view the physician as being more beneficentto his patient, by honoring the patient's living will . A rapid approach to ethical problems: to beused for decisions when there is insufficienttime for detailed ethical analysis (Kenneth V.Iserson, MD. 1995) Step 1: Is this a type of ethical problem for which you have already worked out a rule, or isit at least similar enough so that the rule couldreasonably be extended? -Yes:Follow the rule. -No:Proceed to Step 2. Step 2: Is there an option that will buy you timefor deliberation without risk to the patient? -Yes: Take that option. -No: Apply the tests of impartiality, universalizability and interpersonaljustifiability. -Test of impartiality : Would you be willing to have this action performed if you were thepatient? -Test of universalizability : Are you willing to have this action performed in all relevantlysimilar circumstances?Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 655Ethics and end-of-life issues-Test of interpersonal justifiability : Are you able to provide good reasons to justify your actions to others? Will peers,superiors, or the public be satisfied withthe answers? Choose an action and document thought process in the chart Applied health care ethics expects that an ethical decision (action) will occur in parallel with otherclinical decisions. Once the physician chooses acourse of action, the thought process should bedocumented in the \"medical decision making\"section of the medical record. \" Given the patient's choice to decline intubation as described in her livingwill, I will support her respirations with non-invasiveventilatory methods (BiP AP), which appear to helpher sense of dyspnea .\"End-of-life issues Emergency physicians encounter patients whomay quickly expire. One of the most meaningfulexpressions of the patient-physician relationshipcomes from the thoughtful and considerate treat-ment of dying patients. To respect patient auton-omy during this process, physicians must quicklyassess the patient's individual preferences forend-of-life care. Two issues are paramount: resuscitation wishes and naming of a surrogate decision-maker. Resuscitation preferences The term DNR is a poor descriptor of a patient'sdetailed preferences for end-of-life care (Table43.1). For example, some patients may not wishto be maintained on a ventilator and therefore Yes, follow the rule Yes, take that optionNo No Apply the threetests belowAttempt to treat shock with intravenousfluids and use non-invasive ventilation(bilevel positive airway pressure) andmedications to support breathing.Case: Mrs. Y has had a myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock and severe pulmonary edema. Her son wants her resuscitated, demanding intravenous pressors and mechanical ventilation if necessary. The patient has end-stage liver cancer and there is a valid do not resuscitate/do not intubate order accompanying her nursing home chart. Is this a type of ethical problem for which you have already worked out a rule? In such instances, a valid 'do notresuscitate' form should be respected. No intubation or intravenous pressors. Is there an option that will buy timewithout risk to the patient? Test of impartiality :Would you be willing to be resuscitated if you hada terminal illness? Test of universalizability :Will you resuscitate all patients who present in extremis,regardless of their predetermined wishes? Test of interpersonal justifiability :Will it be difficult to defend/argue that all critical patients be resuscitated, regardless of their chronic conditions or wishes? Figure 43.1 Using the rapid approach to ethical problems. Adapted from: Iserson KV: An approach to ethical problems in emergencymedicine. In: Iserson KV, Sanders AB, Mathieu D (eds). Ethics in Emergency Medicine , 2nd ed., 1995. Tucson, AZ: Galen Press.are labeled do not intubate (DNI) , but would want to be defibrillated if they developed ventricular fibrillation. Physicians should approach resusci-tation preferences as separate questions and listthe answers in the chart after the DNR no intubation, surrogate decision-makers Surrogate decision-makers should be identified inthe event a patient lacks capacity at a later time.Surrogates should have an appreciation of thepatient's end-of-life preferences, so that theymake future decisions in accordance with theirwishes. Surrogates can be named in a number ofways. \"Next-of-kin\" is a common method thatstates use to legally identify surrogates, if one hasnot already been named in an advance directive.Advance directives are lengthy, descriptive state-ments that provide a detailed discussion ofpatient preferences, including the identification ofa surrogate decision-maker. Advance directivesare much more involved than DNR/DNI forms,which generally include answers only to specificresuscitation questions. \"Living wills\" can pro- vide even more information, addressing prefer-ences for the handling of the corpse and potentialorgan donation. A \"health care proxy\" form refersto the legal designation of a surrogate, only afterprior consultation with an attorney. This proxycan be arranged alone, as part of an advance directive, or in conjunction with a living will. Once resuscitation preferences and a surrogate decision-maker are known, the medical team canbetter plan for future decisions to escalate or with-draw life-sustaining care. When such informationis unknown, society expects that physicians willfully resuscitate dying patients with two ultimategoals in mind: to save their life and to restore themto a state in which they can make autonomousdecisions. If patients are later found to have validDNR/DNI orders, it is ethically justified to with-draw life-sustaining care in accordance to theirpreviously identified wishes. Though withdrawalof care can be emotionally upsetting to health careproviders, it represents a profound demonstrationof one's respect for patient autonomy. Death notification As there is no \"right\" way to inform family mem-bers of a loved one's death, physicians can developa method that fits their personality and bedsidemanner. It is important to keep in mind that whilethe primary objective is death notification, thereis certain information that needs to be obtainedfrom family members as well (Table 43.2). First,ask the names and relationships of everyonepresent and confirm that they would have hadpermission to know the medical details of thecase. Always notify the surrogate decision-makeror next-of-kin before speaking to other family andfriends. Briefly inquire about the details of eventsleading up to the patient's arrival in the ED, ifthese were unknown. Once loved ones begin grieving, they may not be capable of providingneeded details. Next, explain exactly what youknew of the situation and what interventionswere performed. Specifically state that the resus-citation was unsuccessful and that the patient died. Do not sugar coat the events with euphemismsfor death, as it may be confusing to some familymembers. Use a sympathetic voice and offerphysical gestures of comfort, such as handhold-ing, if this seems appropriate. Acknowledge theefforts of the pre-hospital providers and nursing Ethics and end-of-life issues 656 Unique Issues in Emergency MedicineIf your heart was to stop beating, would you want chest compressions performed? If you were to stop breathing, would you want abreathing tube placed so that a ventilator couldbreathe for you? If your heart went into a life-threatening rhythm,would you want to be shocked out of it? If your blood pressure dropped, would you wantmedications that might make it normal again? Is it acceptable to give you intravenous fluid andantibiotic medications to treat your condition?Table 43.1 Questions used to define resuscitation preferences Notify only those individuals who have permissionto hear about the details of the case. Identify next-of-kin and notify these individualsbefore addressing other family and friends. Briefly obtain any needed information about thepre-hospital events. Succinctly describe the emergency departmentcourse and interventions. State that the resuscitation was unsuccessful andthat the patient died. Respond to grief with sympathetic gestures. Acknowledge efforts by pre-hospital staff, nursesand family members. Address the needs of those present.Table 43.2 Important steps in death notificationstaff, especially if they had interacted directly with family members. Reassure loved ones thatthey should not blame themselves, as many fam-ily members will feel that the outcome may havebeen different had they intervened earlier. Ifquestions arise about other possible interventionsor a more lengthy resuscitation, focus on the con-cept of brain anoxia using phrases such as \"braindeath\" and \"could not have been the same persongiven that length of time.\" The discussion should end by addressing the needs of those present. Utilize your support staffand have them remain after the notification;never leave a family member alone when youexit the room. Ask if they would like a nurse orsocial worker to assist in contacting a funeralhome and making arrangements for the corpse.Inquire about any spiritual needs that might beaddressed by contacting a chaplain or spiritualadvisor. Acknowledging cultural or religiousneeds may be the most comforting thing you cando for some families. Ask those present if theywould like some time with the deceased. Preparethem for what they will see, and make certainsomeone from the healthcare team is availablefor them. Lastly, remember to ask if the surrogaterequests an autopsy. This question is mandated by law in many states. Special ethical issues in teaching hospitals Unique ethical dilemmas arise in academic medical centers as a function of the training environment.The inherent nature of apprenticeship in medicaleducation sometimes conflicts with patient expect-ations that their care be delivered by only the mostwell-trained individuals. Ethical issues arisingfrom the teaching environment require specialattention by both the instructor and learner. Informed consent Legal and ethical principles mandate that phys-icians obtain informed consent for all treatmentsdelivered. Patients are generally asked to consentto treatment when they arrive at the ED, indicat-ing that they agree to be examined by the phys-ician and receive \"routine\" care (blood tests,radiographs and medications). While this initialconsent implies that patients understand thebenefits of such care, physicians should makeevery effort to review the risks of all significantinterventions (i.e., new medications that maycause adverse reactions). More \"invasive\" pro-cedures require additional information before apatient can truly give informed consent. At manyhospitals, this process includes separate consentforms which provide added documentation thata special discussion occurred. There are four steps to obtaining informed consent: 1.The physician should assure that patients possess the capacity to make an informed choice. Capacity , which refers to the ability to understand one's options and make anauthentic choice, differs from the legal termcompetence. Competence is a court-determined judgment of capacity; physicians maycomment on a patient's decision-makingcapacity, but are not permitted to declaresomeone incompetent. If a patient cannotunderstand treatment options as a result oforganic or psychiatric illness, a physicianshould describe them as \"lacking decision-making capacity.\" Patients who lack capacitycannot consent to treatment, so a health careproxy should be identified (i.e., next-of-kin orpredetermined surrogate decision-maker).Such patients may still be able to agree totreatment; however, both the consent andassent should be documented. 2.The risks and benefits of proposed interventions should be reviewed in detail.This need not be an exhaustive list of allpossible outcomes, but rather a discussion ofthe most common and serious complications.Physicians should make every effort toprovide an honest risk-benefit analysis,including alternative treatments and thechoice to have no intervention whatsoever.This step is critically important in teachinghospitals. Students and residents should notobtain consent for a procedure or treatment ifthey are unable to provide detailedrisk-benefit information. Additionally,patients should understand which teammember will be performing an invasiveprocedure, as well as the designatedattending physician available for supervision. 3.The patient must comprehend the information discussed. One way to assesssuch understanding is to ask the patient torepeat the salient points from the conversation, in his or her own words. Theyshould not simply repeat medical jargon.Patient questions should be elicited andanswered as well. Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 657Ethics and end-of-life issues4.Patients should confirm that they feel comfortable with their decision, acknowledging that their choice wasvoluntary and without duress. Both medicalstaff and family members can undulyinfluence patients to provide consent that isneither authentic nor autonomous. It isacceptable and ethically responsible to askpatients if they felt that they made theirdecision without feeling pressured. Research ethics and the emergency exception to consent Teaching hospitals often conduct research activity as part of their academic mission. Patients identi- fied as potential research subjects for studies mustfirst provide informed consent prior to their partic-ipation. It is sometimes difficult to obtain consentfor emergency medicine research projects, how-ever, as patients often present gravely ill and alone.They may lack the decision-making capacity nec-essary for consent and have no surrogate availableto speak on their behalf. This complicates emer-gency medicine research, as it limits the ability toenroll subjects and conduct studies. Additionally,patients who might benefit from novel interven-tions are sometimes precluded from receivingsuch care when they are unable to provide consent. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognized these limitations and defined a set of guidelines termed the \"waiver of informed con-sent for emergency research.\" This waiver ofconsent can be granted by human subjects com-mittees or institutional review boards if: 1.there is a necessity for such research (study subjects have a life-threatening condition for which current treatments areunsatisfactory); or 2.there is a prospect for direct benefit to thesubjects (risks are reasonable given thecritical nature of the medical condition); or 3.informed consent from patientrepresentatives will be pursued (follow-up consent from surrogates or communitynotification of the ongoing study). While these guidelines offer researchers a methodby which to conduct emergency medicine studies,they provide important ethical assurance thatresearch subjects will be protected and respected. Procedures on the newly dead Recently deceased patients are occasionally used to teach life-saving, invasive procedures to students and residents at teaching hospitals. An ethical dilemma exists between the need to respectthe integrity and autonomy of patients and familymembers, and the need to train health careproviders. In response to this issue, the AmericanMedical Association's (AMA) Council on Ethicaland Judicial Affairs created a set of guidelines tohelp institutions ensure ethically-responsiblebehavior in such learning environments. Prior toperforming procedures on the newly deceased,the following considerations should be addressed: 1.The teaching of life-saving skills should be the culmination of a structured trainingsequence, performed under close supervisionand in accordance with the wishes andvalues of all involved parties. 2.Physicians should attempt to assess if thedeceased had expressed preferences for thehandling of his or her body after death. If not, consent should be obtained fromfamily members before proceeding. In theabsence of expressed preferences or surrogateconsent, physicians should not perform procedures for training purposes. Theseguidelines were incorporated into the 2003AMA Code of Medical Ethics. Pearls of wisdom: issues of professional ethics for physicians-in-training Do not lie. The pressure to perform well in training programs often leads students and residents to misrepresent their knowledge or actions. Patient well-being is the utmostconcern. Avoid the trap of embellishinghistory and physical examination details inorder to appear more complete to yourevaluators. Do not misrepresent yourself . ED patients are acutely ill and vulnerable. They expect thebest care possible and will assume thatstudents or residents have more training thanthey actually do. Clearly describe your roleon the health care team and be honest aboutyour level of training. It is the attendingphysician's responsibility to supervise careand answer patient questions regarding thehierarchy of the teaching hospital. Do not do procedures if you feel uncomfortable . Busy EDs often afford too much autonomyand responsibility to their trainees. Learners Ethics and end-of-life issues 658 Unique Issues in Emergency Medicinemay be asked to perform procedures they have never seen or read about previously.Grades and evaluations are not as importantas patient safety. Ask for supervision forprocedures requiring skills you have not yetmastered, and refuse to perform themwithout assistance. Do the right thing. As a member of the health care team, you have an obligation to yourpatient. Sometimes you may feel that anethical issue has arisen, but others on theteam seem unaware or unconcerned. It isyour duty to your patient to discuss suchethical issues with the team.

Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 659Ethics and end-of-life issuesUnique Issues in Emergency Medicine 661Legal aspects of emergency care Scope of the problem Emergency physicians interact with various aspects of the legal system throughout their career.Along with a relatively high likelihood of mal-practice claims, emergency physicians often inter-act with police as they assess and treat traumapatients. They must also routinely deal withcomplicated legal issues such as advance direc-tives, informed consent, protection of minors,mandatory reporting to health authorities, invol-untary confinement, and compliance with fed-eral laws, such as the Emergency MedicalTreatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). This chapter introduces the most common legal concepts that arise in emergency medicine.It begins with a discussion of legal issues thatdevelop during patient car e, followed by a review of physician interactions with the criminal justicesystem, providing care under the EMTALA, andfinally medical malpractice. The difficulty withany discussion of legal issues on a general levellies in the lack of consistency between the vari-ous legal systems. Broadly speaking, there aretwo main divisions - federal law and state law -and each of these divisions is further subdividedinto criminal, civil, and administrative sections.The laws governing any particular issue may dif-fer depending on the particular state involved (or the federal government) and wh ether criminal, civil, or administrative rules apply. This inconsis-tency results in a certain ambiguity when dis-cussing legal issues in a general sense, andmandates that physicians understand the specific laws that govern in their practice location. Patient care issues Informed consent Certain legal issues begin the moment any patient enters the emergency department (ED); consentto treatment will likely be the first encountered.Competent patients have the right to refuse med-ical care. Conversely, physicians must obtainconsent prior to procedures and treatment or riska charge of battery. Informed consent is a processwhereby the physician and patient discuss therisks, benefits, and alternatives to a given proce- dure or treatment. Although a pa tient's signature on an informed consent document may be pru-dent, it does not by itself meet the legal require-ment of this process. To give informed consent, apatient must have sufficient information onwhich to base a decision about treatment. Thelegal determination of whether the physicianobtained informed consent varies from state tostate, but relies on terms such as \"appropriate\"and \"reasonable,\" thus leaving the issue far fromclear in any given case. Emergency exceptions to consent Certain patients are unable to either consent to orrefuse treatment based on their inability to par- ticipate meaningfully in the informed consentprocess. This typically occurs due to age, intoxi-cation, underlying medical conditions, or acutechanges in mental status. In documenting eitherinformed consent or informed refusal, the physi- cian should make a notation of the patient's men- tal status and ability to consent or r efuse. Physicians sh ould refrain from referring to a patient's competence , as this is a legal term deter- mined by a court, not a physician. Rather, physi-cians should refer to a patie nt's decision-making capacity . When the pa tient cannot provide con- sent, all states have emergency exceptions to theconsent process. Patients medically unable to express consent are presu med to consent to emer- gency stabilizing treatment. Intoxicated patientsusually cannot provide consent , and fall under the emergency excepti on if the patient's decision- making capacity is impaired. Treatment of minors Although most children cannot provide legalconsent, all states have exemptions for childrenpresenting to the ED without a parent or legalguardian. In these situations, the physician canassume consent for any necessary stabilizingtreatment. Additionally, federal law (EMTALA)requires that all children, whether accompanied44 Legal aspects of emergency care Gregory Guldner, MD, MSand Amy Leinen, ESQLegal aspects of emergency care 662 Unique Issues in Emergency Medicineby a consenting adult or not, receive a medical screening examination (MSE) and any necessarystabilizing treatment. In the rare case of a guardianor parent refusing to consent to life-saving treat-ment needed to stabilize a child, physiciansshould generally provide necessary treatmentand obtain a court order after the fact. Note thatage by itself does not necessarily pre clude the ability to consent, as there are conditi ons that allow minors to make their own medical deci- sions. These conditions vary from state to st ate, but often include the ability to consent withoutparental knowledge to treatment for sexuallytransmitted illnesses, pregnancy, drug and alcoholdependency, rape, and mental health concerns.Emanci pated minors, individuals who the law recognizes as adults despite their age, also can consent or refuse treatment without parentalinvolvement. Circumstances that allow mi nors to apply for legal emancipation vary, but ofteninclude active duty in the armed forces, marriage,pregnancy, and parenthood. Informed refusal Patients with decision-making capacity may with-draw consent for treatment at any time. This mayoccur prior to the involvement of a physician,when patients leave the ED before being evalu-ated, or at some point thereafter when they eitherrefuse treatment or leave against medical advice (AMA). When a patient withdraws consent, thephysician must again determine his or her capa-city to do so. Patients with impaired decision-making capacity cannot provide an informedrefusal, and the physician has a duty to provide stabilizing treatment. The majority of patients wholeave AMA do have the capacity to make thatdecision, but every effort should be made touncover the underlying reason for deciding toleave. Occasionally, patients do not understandthe various treatment options or the potential fordeterioration of their condition. While a signa-ture on an AMA form may be helpful defendingagainst litigation, a note in the medical recorddetailing the patient's capacity and the process bywhich informed refusal occurred must supple-ment it. Ideally, a family member should witnessthis discussion and sign the AMA form as well. Some patients will withdraw consent by sim- ply leaving the ED, known as \"eloping.\" Thesepatients constitute a dilemma for the physician,as not all patients can \"elope.\" For example, a 75-year-old patient with advanced Alzheimer'sdisease who wanders from the ED can neither\"elope\" nor provide informed r efusal. Patients who \"elope\" should be discu ssed among involved care providers, including nursing andancillary staff, to determine if the patient reason-ably appeared to have the capacity to withdrawconsent and leave. Patients who do not, such asthe patient above, must be searched for andretrieved as soon as possible. Advance directives Often patients who do not have the capacity toconsent have either a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order or an advance directive that assists in deter- mining their wishes. A DNR order usually relatesonly to the specific condition of cardiopul-monary arrest; that is, a patient does not wishintubation, chest compressions, or defibrillation should their heart stop. Unfortunately, unless these orders are explicit, it often remains unclearas to what exactly the patient would want forconditions less severe than cardiac arrest. If the patient displays signs of impending respiratoryfailure, should they be intubated? If they arehypotensive from unstable ventricular tachycar-dia, should they be cardioverted? Generally, aDNR order does not equal a \"no care\" or \"com- fort care only\" order, and sh ould be interpreted narrowly. The advance directive and durable power of attorney for health care can be more explicit than a general DNR, and may providemore direction to the emergency physician. Oneof the difficulties common in the ED arises whena patient is thought to have a DNR order by staffbut no documentation exists. Unfortunately, thelaws governing this situation vary from state tostate, but written documentation or \"actualknowledge\" of DNR status must usually be pres-ent to withhold care. What constitutes \"actualknowledge\" may be debated in individual cases,but generally refers to situations in which aphysician has personally seen the advance direc-tive even though it is not currently present. Involuntary detainment Another situation in which patients may lose theability to consent involves psychiatric condi-tions, such as severe depression resulting in asuicide attempt. In California, for example,patients who are suicidal, homicidal, or gravelydisabled may be detained up to 72 hours for psy-chiatric evaluation. During this period, thesepatients may receive treatment necessary to stabilize a condition brought on by a suicideUnique Issues in Emergency Medicine 663Legal aspects of emergency careattempt, and they may be restrained by physical or chemical means necessary to protect them-selves or others. The procedure for involuntarilydetaining a patient is complex, and physiciansshould become thoroughly familiar with thelaws in their area, carefully document the eventsthat required detainment, and the methods ofrestraint implemented. Privacy and confidentiality Another common legal issue arising duringpatient care involves privacy and confidentialityissues. The Health Insurance Portability andAccountability Act (HIPAA) sets forth standardsfor hospitals with regard to both personal privacyand the confidentiality of medical records. Whilethe medical records are typically owned by thehospital, the information within them is consid-ered property of the patient. In general, medicalinformation cannot be shared with a third partywithout the consent of the patient unless suchinformation is necessary for medical tr eatment. This includes releasing information to other fam- ily members, insurance companies, and employ-ers. Exceptions to this exist, as all states havemandatory reporting of victims of violence andof certain health conditions. Emergency physi-cians must be careful to obtain consent frompatients prior to speaking with other familymembers, friends, or employers. The requirementsof HIPAA do not apply to information sharedbetween health care providers for the sole purposeof medical evaluation and treatment. Patientsunable to consent due to medical conditions represent a special case that the courts have yetto fully explore. Generally, physicians should pro-ceed with the assumption of what a reasonable person in a similar situation would want withregard to confidentiality. For example, refusing to update a spouse on the status of a critically-injured patient because the patient is unable togive consent for the release of medical informa-tion seems unreasonable. While the courts haveyet to determine many issues in this area, theytypically allow discretion when a physician actsin the best interest of an incapacitated patient.However, in cases of human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV) infection, drug and alcohol intoxica-tion, and mental illness, the risk of damage to thepatient for a breach of confidentiality is oftenconsidered substantial, and the medical informa-tion of patients with these diagnoses should beshared cautiously, if at all. Similarly, certain med-ical information, such as drug or alcohol tests inthe hands of civil authorities, may result in seri-ous consequences to some patients. Physicians in most states may not provide the police medical information on a patient without that patient'sconsent or a court order (excluding mandatory reporting requirements). The criminal justice system Emergency physicians often interact with police, detectives, district attorneys, and criminal defenseattorneys. Table 44.1 lists common interactionsthat may develop during these encounters. Interacting with the criminal justice system is an inevitable part of emergency medicine, and Table 44.1 Common legal issues involving the criminal justice system in emergency medicine Encounter Legal issues and practice suggestions Police are searching for a suspect Ensure that the ED has a mechanism to advise practitioners of criminal who may come to the ED. suspects.Police bring injured suspect to ED Those in custody retain their rights to refuse medical treatment (barring for treatment prior to booking. altered mental status).

A court order is (nasogastric tube, etc.). necessary.Police request medical information Laws vary from state to state. Usually, a patient must consent prior to from physician (patient's releasing information to the police. Some states allow physicians to blood alcohol level, etc.). report intoxicated drivers. Most police agencies prefer to obtain their own blood or urine specimens for legal reasons. (continued )Table 44.2 Major legal requirements mandated by Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)developing an understanding of the laws that regulate interactions with victims, police, sus- pects, witnesses, and attorneys is essential. EMTALA/COBRA Prior to 1986, a critically-ill patient arriving in anED faced the possibility of being refused care ifhe or she was unable to pay. These patients may have suffered significant injury or death dueto delays in finding emergency care. To preventsuch events, Congress passed the EMTALA in 1986as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Rec-onciliation Act (COBRA). EMTALA imposes sev- eral legal requirements on most EDs (Table 44.2). EMTALA compels multiple other require- ments, including that all persons who present to Legal aspects of emergency care 664 Unique Issues in Emergency MedicineTable 44.1 Common legal issues involving the criminal justice system in emergency medicine ( cont) Encounter Legal issues and practice suggestions Physician evaluates patient who Physicians must report children and certain at-risk adults (elderly, appears to be a victim of violence. cognitively-impaired, etc.) who are victims of violence or neglect. Many states require physicians to report victims of domestic violence or animalattacks. Some states require reporting all patients who sustaininjuries from violence. Physician receives a subpoena to Physician must either comply with subpoena or contact the partytestify as a witness. issuing the subpoena (usually prosecutor or defense attorney) and make alternative arrangements. Ignoring a subpoena may result in the courtfinding the physician in contempt. Physician evaluates trauma patient Physician should avoid destroying evidence during treatment. Do notprior to evidence collection cut through bullet holes in clothing, destroy or discard(victim of gunshot wound, etc.). personal belongings, or place chest tubes through gunshot or stab wounds. Refrain from describing wounds as \"entry\" or \"exit\" or speculating on bullet trajectory unless specifically trained to do so. Patient presents with alleged sexual Physicians must provide a medical screening examination. In the medical assault requesting evidentiary record, use the term \"alleged\" because the physician has no directexamination. knowledge of the events. Consider transferring to specialized sexual assault referral center if available after appropriate contacts have beenmade and safe transport is arranged. Requirement Impact on emergency care providers Medical screening EDs must provide a MSE to any patient presenting to the ED to determine if an EMC exists. The MSE can neither be delayed to determine a patient's ability to pay, nor can the extent of the MSE differ from patient to patient based on his or her financial resources. Stabilization EDs must use any available resources, including consultation, to stabilize an EMC. They must neither delay stabilization to investigate financial resources, nor may they vary stabilizing management from patient to patient based on the patient's ability to pay. Acceptance If a patient has an EMC that cannot be stabilized at the initial ED, he or she should be transferred to an ED with the necessary capabilities. The receiving ED must accept thepatient if they have the capacity to stabilize the EMC, regardless of the patient's financialresources, insurance status, or citizenship. Penalties for EDs that fail to comply with EMTALA's requirements face the loss of participation in violations medicare - a penalty that would financially devastate most hospitals. Individual physicians who violate the provisions of EMTALA face significant fines not covered by malpractice insurance. MSE: medical screening examination; EMC: emergency medical condition.Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 665Legal aspects of emergency carethe ED for evaluation be entered into a log book; that EDs post notices informing patients of theirrights under EMTALA; that transfers for higherlevel of care need an accepting physician andmust be accompanied by the appropriate med-ical records and necessary medical personnel;and that institutions having reason to believeanother hospital violated EMTALA must report this violation to the Center for Medicare andMedicaid Services (CMS). While EMTALA began as a way of protect- ing the medically-indigent, it has expanded significantly into an extremely complex networkof legal mandates. Additionally, terms generallythought to have medical definitions, such as\"emergency medical condition (EMC),\" \"screen-ing examination,\" \"stabilization,\" and \"stable fortransfer,\" now have legal definitions that maynot parallel common medical parlance. Due tothis, all physicians must know the duties this lawmandates. Medical malpractice Many physicians think of medical malpractice asthe primary medicolegal issue. Practitioners whoultimately face a malpractice claim usually see itas a personal attack on their character, and theprocess of defending against such a claim canresult in significant emotional and financial stress. Unfortunately, medical malpractice litigation is analmost inevitable part of emergency medical prac-tice, with the average emergency physician facingone claim for every 25,000 patients (one claimevery 5-7 years depending on patient volume).Given that cases can last 3-5 years before resolu-tion, many physicians find that litigation is anongoing aspect of their professional lives. Medical malpractice claims usually fall under the authority of state law, subject to civil rules and procedures (although federal lawsuits arepossible). A lawsuit typically originates when theplaintiff believes that a treating physician failed in their duty to provide appropriate care. The most common allegations include: failure todiagnose (30%), negligent performance of a delay in diagnosis (6%), anddelay in treatment (3%). Once the plaintiff has retained an attorney, the attorney prepares an initial pleading , often called a complaint . These papers are then served on the defendant physician, a process that formallybegins the lawsuit. The physician should thencontact his or her malpractice insurance carrier,who assigns an attorney to the case. The physi-cian's attorney then prepares a response to thecomplaint. To prevail in a malpractice case, a plaintiff must demonstrate four elements: 1.The defendant physician had a duty to treat the plaintiff. 2.The defendant physician breached this duty. 3.This breach was the cause of the plaintiff's injury. 4.The plaintiff suffered actual injury . One or more of these elements may be contested by the defense. The parties usually rely on expertwitness testimony to establish or refute these ele-ments. This often results in highly technical testi-mony that can be confusing to jury members.Additionally, the information on which theseexperts draw their conclusions comes primarilyfrom the medical record, which may be illegible,incomprehensible, or incomplete. This frequentlyresults in not only disagreements over issues of judgment, but also debates over issues of fact. Forexample, the plaintiff argues that peripheralpulses were not checked while the defense claimsthey were. The medical record provides the most persuasive evidence of who is more likely to becorrect. This leads to the often-heard claim fromthose involved in risk management that \"If itwasn't documented, it wasn't done.\" Most medical malpractice claims do not end up in trial; they are settled. Settlement represents arisk reduction strategy in that the plaintiffsrecover some award and the defendants prevent an unexpectedly high judgment against them. Ofthose cases that are decided by a jury, approxi-mately 70-90% result in verdicts for the defense.Despite these favorable odds, most physiciansinvolved in a malpractice claim report it as a dis-tinctly unpleasant experience. This has resulted insubstantial interest in methods to reduce the num-ber of claims. While many plaintiff's attorneys would assert that reducing malpractice claims simply requirespracticing good medicine, there is evidence thatmany claims have little to do with negligence.Bad outcomes occur even with the best care.Despite the legal requirements to show bothbreach of duty and causation, more patientswithout evidence of negligence file suit than do those who suffered negligent care. This sug-gests that factors exist, other than excellent med-ical care, that can influence one's likelihood ofbeing sued.Legal aspects of emergency care 666 Unique Issues in Emergency MedicinePerhaps the best known of these factors is the interpersonal relationship between the physician and patient. Patients and family members who believe that their physician showed genuine car-ing and excellent communication skills rarely con- template a lawsuit, even in the face of a badoutcome or substandard care. Nearly half of thevariance in patient satisfaction stems frompatients' assessments of the physician's interper- sonal skills and professional manner. Whenpatients feel that their physician is open andhonest, they more readily accept that medicalcare is not an exact science, and that clinical judg-ments can sometimes be wrong without claiming malpractice on the part of the physician. Con-versely, when patients and/or families feel con-fused and ignored, they sometimes believe that thecourtroom is the only venue in which they canlearn the truth about what actually happened. Agood bedside manner is critical in preventing theunderlying emotional context that leads to thisfeeling of mistrust. Researchers compared theinterpersonal skills of physicians with multiplemalpractice claims to physicians without claims.They found that those who had never been suedspent more time with patients, told the patientwhat to expect, asked more questions to ascertainthe patient's opinions and understanding, usedmore humor, and encouraged the patient to talk. Asecond factor in reducing malpractice claims is the quality of the medical record . One of the first hurdles a potential plaintiff must negotiate isfinding a plaintiff's attorney who believes thecase will result in a favorable outcome. Often, thebetter the documentation, the more difficult successful litigation will be for the plaintiff.Many cases revolve around factual debatesbetween the plaintiff and physician, and themedical record may provide the sole source ofevidence for either side. The court often interpretsan absence of a notation in the medical record asevidence that an act did not occur. One difficulttask for a busy emergency physician is determin-ing what exactly should be documented.Unfortunately, scant research on this topic exists.Common sense suggests that physicians shouldfocus their efforts on high-risk areas, such asinformed consent, informed refusal, and leavingAMA, as well as high-risk presentations, such aschest pain, abdominal pain, headache, fever, andtrauma. In many cases, a mere word or two makesa tremendous difference. For example, considerthe description of the onset of a headache as\"gradual.\" A case of a missed subarachnoid hem-orrhage may pivot on this one word. Although a malpractice claim may originate from any patient and from any complaint, practi-tioners cannot be expected to invest substantialtime and effort on the documentation and riskmanagement issues for every patient they see.However, emergency physicians should be awareof the most common presentations among all casesresulting in litigation (Table 44.3). Conclusion Many physicians attempt to minimize their inter-actions with the law. Unfortunately, the nature ofemergency medicine makes such interactions Table 44.3 Common presenting complaints resulting in malpractice claims Presenting complaint Common unexpected outcomes Percent of claims Trauma Missed foreign body 20 Missed fracture Wound infection Abdominal pain Missed appendicitis 14 Missed aortic aneurysmMissed myocardial infarction Infections Missed meningitis 10 Missed pneumonia Vaginal bleeding Missed ectopic pregnancy 9 Chest pain Missed myocardial infarction 8 Missed pulmonary embolism Adapted from the Risk Management Foundation of the Harvard Medical Institutions.Unique Issues in Emergency Medicine 667Legal aspects of emergency carecommon. EDs represent the front line of medical care. The privilege of staffing these lines comeswith inevitable legal duties and legal risks.Physicians must have substantial knowledge ofthe law as it pertains to emergency care and theirpractices, especially in their state. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Informed consent is not simply a signatureon a release form. It is a process in which thephysician and patient discuss risks, benefits,and alternatives. A signature without thisprocess does not constitute legal informedconsent. A patient with decision-making capacity can refuse care even if such refusal does not appear to be in their best interest. Performingprocedures against a patient's wishesconstitutes battery. Unaccompanied children presenting to theED should receive any evaluation andtreatment necessary to detect and stabilize anEMC even if parents or guardians are notpresent to provide consent. Unless needed for patient care, sharing anadult patient's personal health informationwith a third party, including other familymembers, requires their consent. Cooperate with law enforcement wheneverpossible, but be aware of the patient's rightsand legal restrictions on sharing informationwith police. In treating victims of violence, emergency physicians must remember: (a) any legalrequirements to report these events to authorities; and (b) to preserve and protectevidence, such as clothing or wounds on thevictim. Most malpractice claims do not arise out ofnegligent care. They often stem fromdissatisfaction with the interpersonal andprofessional relationship between the patient,family, and physician. Many malpractice claims can be avoided by:(a) improving the communication betweenphysician, patients and family; and (b)careful documentation.Referenes 1.Bisaillon D.

Although the exact per-centage varies according to location, a substan-tial proportion of emergency department (ED)patients are actively infected or carriers of ser-ious illnesses that can be transmitted to healthcare professionals. It is estimated that 75% of USemergency medicine residents sustain a needle-stick injury during residency. In the US healthcare system, 60,000-800,000 needlesticks arereported each year, and an estimated 40-90% of these injuries are unreported. An accidentalexposure can drastically transform a caregiverinto a patient. This chapter's goal is to decreasethe frequency of these events, and minimize theirimpact should they occur. Pathophysiology The chain of events can be conceptualizedaccording to the following simple diagram. The source patient in the ED is not a factor that can be modified, given the diverse popula-tion presenting to the ED for care. The act ofinoculation, however, may be prevented throughbehavior modification. Inoculation typicallyoccurs in two fashions: directly and indirectly.Direct inoculation occurs when the surfaces of thesource and the recipient come into primary con-tact, and the agent is transferred as a result of thiscontact. This includes skin contact, ingestion ofan agent, direct spray of fluids onto mucousmembranes, and droplet contact. Droplets arisefrom spitting, talking, and coughing, and rapidlysettle out of the air in a matter of seconds.Generally speaking, droplets cannot traverse adistance /H110221meter. Indirect inoculation occurs by means of some intermediary. If this intermediary is living, it iscalled a vector ; if inanimate, it is called a vehicle . A hypodermic needle or shard of glass would beconsidered a vehicle, as would an aerosol. Anaerosol is a droplet, but of such minute propor-tions (1-3 /H9262m) that it remains suspended in air and transported from one person to the next byair currents. Regardless of route of inoculation, an exposed health care worker can become colonized orinfected, and may cause infection to other patients,co-workers, or family members. History Once an exposure has occurred, a focused his-tory allows one to best assess the risk and initiatean appropriate care plan. What was the nature of the exposure? Was it percutaneous, direct contact, spray, orinhalation? If percutaneous, describe theexposure. Certain factors have been correlated withincreased risk of transmission in the case of ahuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) needle-stick. Deeper penetration, larger-bore needle,hollow versus solid needle, source blood readilyapparent on device, and high viral load in thesource blood are all associated with greater like-lihood of infection transmission. These factorscontribute to the delivery of a larger number ofinfectious particles, increasing the chance ofinfection.Stephen J. Playe, MDand Cemil M. Erdem, MD45 Occupational exposures in the emergency department Source patient Health care workerInoculation Subsequent patients Other caregiversOccupational exposures in the emergency department 670 Unique Issues in Emergency MedicineWho is the source patient? What is the potential risk? The source patient may know he or she is infected, and may volunteer this information. If asource patient is not known to have a commu-nicable disease, certain factors increase the chancehe or she may harbor occult, undocumented infec-tion. Intravenous (IV) drug use, sexual promiscu- ity without barrier use, history of other sexuallytransmitted illnesses (STIs), and blood transfu-sion or organ transplantation are risks for blood-borne illnesses, such as HIV , hepatitis B (Hep B),or hepatitis C (Hep C). Travel or residence in areas where tuber- culosis is endemic (Africa, Asia except Japan,Middle East, South/Central America, Mexico,Eastern Europe, and the Caribbean), cohabitinginfected family member, or residence in crowdedsettings such as prisons, drug rehabilitation facil-ities, and homeless shelters are risk factors for tuberculosis transmission. What is your immunization status? This question is applicable to the source patient as well as the health care worker. Documented Hep Bvaccination is highly effective (80-95%) in prevent-ing infection, and if antibody response is foundadequate by assay, protection is essentially guar-anteed. In the case of tuberculosis, skin-testing his-tory in conjunction with chest X-ray is helpful inestablishing disease activity. It should be empha-sized that the long-term immunity conferred bythe bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine givenin endemic areas is poor and unreliable, rangingfrom 0% to 80%, and should not be interpreted asproof of immunity. In contrast, 99% of persons whohave received varicella immunization demonstratea serologic to varicella and zoster. A reliable,documented history of exposure to varicella isconsidered an adequate substitute for active vacci-nation, as the majority of previously infected indi-viduals have lasting immunity. Tetanus vaccineshould be readministered every 5 years to healthcare workers. Physical examination The physical examination of exposed health careworkers is seldom helpful. In a percutaneousexposure, there may be a small puncture wound;in cases of inhalation, spray, or direct contact,meaningful physical evidence is unlikely to befound. This fact underscores the importance of athorough history. Examination of the source patient, if available, may be useful when fulminant disease is present.For example, a patient with thrush, fever, wast-ing, and pneumonia demonstrating a \"bat-wing\"appearance on chest X-ray raises concern for therisk of contagion. Most exposures, however, willnot afford such a clear picture. Selected agents Table 45.1 provides a list of organisms causing commonly encountered clinically importantexposures in the ED.

Poor compliance withhandwashing has been repeatedly documented.Stated barriers to compliance include timerequirements, irritation from soap and water, lack of access to sinks, and \"being too busy.\" Theadvent of alcohol-based rubbing solutions over-comes many of these barriers. These solutions takeonly seconds to apply, dry without irritation, andhave been found to be more effective than soapand water in killing pathogens. Handrubbing withthese solutions is simple, fast, and significantlyreduces exposure rates to contact pathogens in the ED. Gloves Gloves should be put on before contacting bodyfluids or open wounds, or for the general exam-ination of patients when the health care worker'sskin is not intact. Gloves are an adjunct to, not asubstitute for, proper hand hygiene. They shouldbe removed immediately after patient contact, soas not to contaminate other persons, charts, orequipment. Contact precautions These are an extension of standard precautions to all objects and surfaces in a patient's room whois thought by history, examination, or clinical suspicion to harbor a contact pathogen such (VRE). A sign reminding staff and announcing to visitors the necessity for gown andgloves may help increase adherence to standardprecautions and prevent the spread of pathogens.

Droplet precautions Infections including influenza, streptococcalpharyngitis, meningitis, SARS-related coronavirus,mumps, rubella, pertussis, diphtheria, and mostupper respiratory infections are transmitted bythe projection of large particles of respiratorysecretions that then can directly contact the eyesor the mucous membranes of the nose or mouth.Coughing, sneezing, talking, or singing can projectthese droplets approximately three feet. Thedroplets do not remain suspended in the air; thus,special air handling and ventilation is not required.Precautions include standard precautions plus eyeprotection and a standard surgical mask wornwhen working within three feet of the patient. Aerosol protection While treating patients with suspected tubercu-losis or other aerosol-transmitted pathogens (e.g.,tuberculosis, varicella or measles), a mask should be worn by both examiner and patient to minimizeorganism transmission. A negative-pressure iso-lation room limits spread to other ED patients. Given the prevalence of active tuberculosis in the homeless (1-5%) and HIV-infected populations(a third of HIV patients worldwide are co-infectedwith Mycobac terium tuberculosis ), special vigilance is appropriate in both the triage and treatment of these patients to areas with appropriate aerosolprecautions, especially if active coughing and res- piratory symptoms are pr esent. Behavior modification Often simple measures can drastically minimizethe risk of exposure. Proper positioning, prepar-ation, and control of procedures involving body fluids are essential. Asking for another set of handsin a busy ED may be a minor inconvenience to others, but is preferable to performing a procedurein an unsafe manner with potentially disastrousconsequences. Another behavior which needs tochange is that of recapping needles. Many healthcare workers, both new and seasoned, disregardwarnings. Even the most dexterous among us willfail at this simple task eventually, or have a needleperforate the side of the cap. The only way we canavoid this mishap is to never attempt recappingneedles in the first place.System-based safeguards The provision of accessible sharps containers thatare emptied regularly, needleless IV systems, self-protecting needle systems, an effective and non-punitive exposure reporting system, and clear,consistent protocols for exposed health careworkers are institutional-level measures that canhelp diminish exposure and risk of infection. General treatment principles Even with the best technique, preparation, and intentions, exposures are bound to occur. Oncean exposure has occurred, and determined thatthe source patient represents a realistic likeli-hood of carrying one or more contagious dis-eases, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) shouldbe initiated. Specific measures depend on thespecific pathogen involved and the degree ofexposure. Human immunodeficiency virus With a percutaneous exposure, the decision regarding PEP should be made as soon as possible. The optimum timing for beginning PEPin humans is unknown, but animal studies sug-gest the sooner it is started, the better. The cur-rent goal is that if anti-retroviral therapy is to be instituted, it should begin within 2 hours ofexposure. The regimen can always be discon-tinued later. The current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC-P) recommendations for PEPare presented (Figure 45.2). The aim of the algorithm is to assess the severity of both theexposure and likelihood that the source patienthas HIV infection. The Exposure Code (EC) strat-ifies the risk of the exposure, including the rela-tive risk for different exposure types. Forexample, a deep needlestick with a large-boreneedle with visible blood at the tip is a moresevere exposure than a patient coughing in one'sunprotected eye. The EC reflects this differencein severity. The HIV Status Code (HIV SC) represents the likelihood that the source patient in question in fact is HIV positive. A healthy 6-year old has a lower risk for carrying HIV than a man withtrack-marks and oral candidiasis; the HIV SCrepresents this relative risk of HIV infection.

The expanded regimen is the basic regimen plus either indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours) or nelfi-navir (750 mg t.i.d). Other regimens may be con-sidered depending on local resistance patterns. The rate of HIV infection following a needle- stick injury is estimated to be between 0.3% and0.5%. This low incidence makes study of the efficacy of PEP challenging. Animal models anddecreased maternal-fetal transmission of virus withprophylaxis suggest that these medications modifytransmission. A retrospective case-controlled studyof exposed health care workers found that the useof zidovudine PEP was associated with a /H1102280% reduction in HIV disease transmission. The duration of required PEP is contested; pending definitive data, prophylaxis should con-tinue for 28 days. Follow-up surveillance of health care workers is imperative, and should be conducted for 12 months post-exposure, since late conversionhas been reported. Pending the outcome of serologic testing, patients should be counseled to avoid unpro-tected sex, and should not donate blood or tis-sues, share toothbrushes or razors, or breastfeed. Consent for testing the source patient must be obtained before sending serology. Most patientsare helpful and readily give consent when the situ-ation is explained. If the patient is clinically unable to give consent, hospital policies based onstate law should be followed. Hepatitis B Most health care workers in the US receive theHep B vaccine.

The travel history of the source patient is particularly important in this case, as highrates of resistance to standard therapies in someregions will guide therapy. Meningococcal meningitis Close household contacts of individuals withmeningococcal meningitis should receive prophy-lactic antibiotics, as there is a 4/1000 incidence of secondary infection in the household of theindex case. Close contact is defined as living inthe same household as the index case for 4 ormore hours in the past week, day care, dormitoryor barracks contacts, and anyone with whom thepatient has shared oral secretions (kissing, sharedutensils, cigarettes). Using this definition, most health care workers are spared chemoprophylaxis provided they exer-cise and maintain good precautions. Exceptionsinclude mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, airwaymanagement, or inadvertent exposure to oralsecretions without use of a protective mask. Generally a one-time dose of ciprofloxacin is used as chemoprophylaxis when needed, but ceftriaxone, azithromycin, or rifampin are rea-sonable alternatives. Varicella Ideally, all health care workers should eitherreceive immunization against varicella or have formal documentation of a prior infection. Bothsituations confer immunity in the vast majorityof cases. Many adults without documentedexposure are not susceptible, as the transmissionrate in these individuals is only 5-15%. However,adult-onset varicella can be serious, with deathrates as 50/100,000. Administration ofvaricella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) canavert or diminish the severity of a varicella zosterinfection, and should be implemented in suscep- tible, exposed adults, especially those who are immunocompromised. It is impor tant to note that indiscriminate use of VZIG would deplete the supply, which is used to treat high-riskneonates. Exposed, susceptible health care workers should be temporarily relieved of patient careduty on days 10-21 following exposure, as this istypically when they might be infectious (even ifthe rash has not yet appeared). Should they con-tract the disease, they may return to work afterthe last crop of lesions has crusted over.Special patients Pregnant (or potentially-pregnant) For HIV prophylaxis, there is little data regard-ing fetal risk. Current recommendations suggestthat the best treatment for the fetus is the propertreatment of the mother. The basic and expandedregimens are used as in nonpregnant patients. One exception is that efavirenz (Sustiva) shouldnot be used, as it has shown teratogenicity in pri-mate models at doses biologically equivalent tothe dose range in humans. Additionally, pregnant caregivers in the ED should avoid occupational hazards unique to thehospital: inhalation anesthetic agents (particu-larly nitrous oxide), ethylene ED care following an exposure provides the firstday of a long, stressful period for the exposedhealth care worker, during which he or she willlikely agonize over having possibly contracted alife-threatening illness. It is important to ensuregood follow-up, preferably by communicating itsimportance to the patient as well as notifying thepatient's primary care physician directly. While itis important to communicate facts and get neces-sary blood work, it is equally important to under-stand that the patient's status as a health careprofessional does not insulate him or her from theangst of the situation, and to be sensitive to this. Pre-printed information and instructions should be provided in the exposed person's pre-ferred language. Since recommendations change frequently, all clinicians are advised to consult on-line ortelephone-accessed references (Figure 45.4).

Time may be a consideration, as certainprocedures are lifesaving or crucial to a patient'swell-being. Circumstances may require that aprocedure be performed without undue delay.The need to perform a procedure expeditiouslyshould never lead one to rush the task, though,as the potential for error is magnified by haste.Attention must also always be paid to properpreparation and technique. Some procedures aretime-consuming; adequate time should be bud-geted for their completion. Contraindications exist to most of the proced- ures in this section, and an effort should be madeto elicit a patient history of illness or medicationsbeing taken that may constitute contraindica-tions or precautions. In the unconscious, intoxi-cated or uncooperative patient, such medicalhistory may be incomplete or difficult to obtain. Some of the procedures described need to be performed utilizing sterile technique. It is veryimportant that this be adhered to, because infec-tion is always an undesirable and sometimes dan-gerous complication. In all instances, also assumethat there is a risk of contracting infectious dis-ease by contact with the patient's blood, secre-tions or other bodily fluids. Utilize precautions toavoid such contact, including gloves, eye protec-tion, masks and surgical gowns, as appropriate. Be aware what the complications of various procedures are, and assess the patient for signs oftheir appearance. Not all complications manifestimmediately, but signs of some, such as pneumo-thorax consequent to central venipuncture, appearshortly after they are caused. In such instances,obtaining post-procedure tests (e.g., achest radiograph following subclavian or internaljugular cannulation) or instituting appropriatemonitoring is imperative. There are variations in the performance of some of the procedures described here, as well as\"short cuts\" known to experienced practitioners.Until you have mastered a particular procedurevia standard technique, avoid the use of suchalternate methods. When performing a proce-dure as a member of a resuscitation team, focuson the task and do not be distracted by othermanagement activities being carried out simulta-neously. Be aware of the materials required forthe procedure and assemble these beforehand, soyou do not have to break sterile technique orinterrupt performance to ask an assistant foradditional items.

Peripheral venous cannulation Indications The indications include the need for vascular access for the administration of intravenous (IV)fluids, blood products or medications. Even stablepatients in whom such administration is antici-pated are likely to benefit from having an IV linein place. For patients who require rapid volumeresuscitation, short, large-bore peripheral IV catheters allow more rapid flow of fluids than dolonger central venous catheters.Appendix A Common emergency procedures George dislocations 696Tube thoracostomy 700 Cervical spine clearance 703Abscess incision and drainage 704Common emergency procedures 682 AppendicesContraindications Whenever possible, avoid entry through skin that shows signs of infection or is burned. Do notuse veins that have previously been involved withphlebitis or thrombosis, extremities affectedwith lymphatic insufficiency. Insertion of a periph-eral venous catheter may be difficult in patients who have venous collapse as a result of hypov-olemia, who are obese, edematous or have a his-tory of IV drug abuse. Gloves Povidone-iodine antiseptic solution Tourniquet Over-the-needle venous catheter (angiocatheter) IV tubing set and fluid bag Sterile dressing Arm board Tape Technique This procedure is described on the arm, where itis most commonly performed, though the leg,scalp, or external jugular veins are sometimesutilized (Figure A.1). Prepare the IV setup byattaching IV tubing to the solution bag and run-ning solution to fill the tubing. Place a tourniquetaround the upper arm and search for a prominentvein. These are usually found in the antecubitalfossa or the dorsum of the hand. If no prominentveins are apparent, apply a warm towel to theskin to induce venodilation. Tapping over a veincan also cause reflex dilation of the vascular wall.Having the patient open and close the fist willalso distend the vein.The tourniquet should be placed about 3-4 cm proximal to the puncture site. It should be tightenough to impede venous flow, but not so con-stricting as to curtail arterial circulation. Tie thetourniquet in a single loop in such a way that itcan be released with one hand. Prepare the site in sterile fashion. With the non- dominant hand, pull the skin taut and stabilize thevein. Puncture the skin with the needle/catheterunit, entering at about a 30\u00b0 angle to the skin. Keepthe bevel of the needle facing upward. Puncturethe vein. When the vein is entered, blood willappear in the flash chamber of the angiocatheter.Holding the unit steady, advance the catheter overthe needle and into the vein. Remove the needle,holding the catheter in place. Attach the IV tubing to the catheter. Remove the tourniquet and simultaneously initiate flowby opening the valve on the tubing. Apply a ster-ile dressing and tape the catheter in place. Tapingthe tubing to the skin in a U-shaped loop willreduce the likelihood of the catheter being acciden- tally dislodged. It may be advisable to affix an arm board if the cannulation site overlies a joint. Fluid should flow freely into the vein. If immediate subcutaneous swelling appears aroundthe catheter site, it indicates the extravasation offluid from the vein. In this instance, stop theinfusion, withdraw the catheter and apply pres-sure over the area. Attempt cannulation at a dif-ferent site. Complications Local bleeding is a common complication. Hematomas are usually produced when theposterior venous wall is punctured during can-nulation. Such bleeding is almost always minorand can be controlled readily by application ofpressure. Accidental puncture of the posterior wall or displacement of the catheter will result in subcuta-neous extravasation of IV fluid. This producesswelling and pain. The condition must be recog-nized early, and the infusion discontinued. Sub-cutaneous infiltration of certain high-osmolalitysolutions (e.g., potassium chloride, sodium bicar-bonate) is particularly toxic to soft tissue and maylead to tissue necrosis. Phlebitis, or inflammation of the vein, occurs frequently at IV sites utilized for several days orlonger, but is not an immediate complication.Local subcutaneous infection is also a delayedcomplication, and its incidence can be dimin-ished by careful skin preparation and technique.

Central venous cannulation Indications Catheterization of the central venous system may be performed for a number of reasons. Onecommon reason is the inability to obtain periph-eral venous access in a patient who requiresurgent administration of IV fluid or medications.The need to infuse medications that are irritatingto smaller peripheral veins also mandates cannu-lation of a central vein. Access to the central cir-culation is also necessary for measurement ofcentral venous pressure, as well as for passage of atemporary transvenous pacemaker or pulmonaryartery catheter. Contraindications There are no absolute contraindications to per- forming central vein cannulation. A relative con-traindication is the presence of a coagulationdisorder. This is particularly a factor in subclavianvenipuncture. The presence of a markedly obesepatient with poorly-defined anatomical land-marks, an uncooperative patient or the presenceof overlying skin infection also constitute relativecontraindications. Equipment Sterile gloves Commercial central venous access kit, including the following:-povidone-iodine antiseptic solution -sterile drapes -anesthetic solution, syringe and introducer -semi-rigid catheter tubingTechnique General The Seldinger guide wire method (Figure A.2) is the recommended technique for insertion of a cen-tralvenous catheter. This allows placement of a large-bore catheter over a wire inserted through asmaller bore needle. Identify the appropriate land-marks according to the vessel to be cannulated. Prepare the skin of the involved area with povi-done-iodine solution. Surround the field with ster-iledrapes. Infiltrate the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue to be entered with about 5 ml of 1% lido-caine. Using the external landmarks to identify thepuncture site, locate the vessel with an introducerneedle (an 18-gauge, 2.5-inch needle) attached toasyringe. Aspirate while advancing the needle until blood flows freely into the syringe. This indicates that the vessel has been entered. If noblood is encountered, withdraw the needle to theskin edge and redirect. Stabilizing the needle in place, remove the syringe and cover the hub of the needle with yourthumb to prevent air from entering the vein. Passthe metal guide wire through the needle. Thewire should pass smoothly through the needleinto the vein. If you encounter resistance, with-draw the wire together with the needle andattempt the procedure again. Once most of the wire been passed through the needle, withdraw the needle over the wire,leaving the wire in place. Be careful not to insertthe entire length of the wire through the needle.Allow enough of the wire to protrude throughthe skin to allow passage of the catheter over it. With a scalpel, make a small superficial inci- sion of the skin at the point of entry of the guidewire. Pass the dilator over the wire with a twist-ing motion. This will create a passage in the sub-cutaneous tissue that will allow easier admittanceof the catheter. Remove the dilator, leaving thewire in place. Be careful not to remove or lose thewire inadvertently. Pass the catheter over the wire in a manner similar to passing the dilator. The catheter shouldadvance smoothly, requiring no force to pass.Remove the guide wire through the catheter andattach the IV bag to the catheter via the tubing. Asyou withdraw the guide wire, be sure the catheteris not extracted inadvertently. Suture the catheter to the skin, first injecting a wheal of anesthetic into the area into which thesuture will be placed. Lower the IV bag belowthe level of the bed for a few seconds.

Apply topical antibiotic ointmentto the venipuncture site and a sterile dressing.When using the internal jugular or subclavianapproaches, obtain a chest radiograph to ascer-tain that the catheter is in proper position andthat no pneumothorax has been produced. Internal jugular vein Position the bed with the patient's head down at an angle of 10-15\u00b0 (the Trendelenburg posi-tion). Turn the patient's head away from the sidebeing used. The right side is preferred because ofthe straighter course of the vein to the superiorvena cava. In critically-ill patients in whom simul-taneous airway management is being performed, the subclavian or femoral approaches may bepreferable. There are several approaches to the internal jugular vein. A widely used one is entry in the tri-angle formed by the clavicle and the sternal andclavicular heads of the sternocleidomatoid mus-cle. The internal jugular vein runs lateral to thecarotid artery in this triangle. Anesthetize theskin and soft tissue in the apex of the triangle.Insert the introducer needle at the apex at anangle of 30-45\u00b0 to the skin and advance the nee-dle toward the ipsilateral nipple (Figure A.3).Aspirate while advancing the needle. Brisk flowof blood into the syringe indicates entry into theinternal jugular vein. Proceed with insertion ofthe guide wire and catheter using the Seldingertechnique. Obtain a chest radiograph to verifycorrect catheter position and the presence of anycomplications.Subclavian vein Position the bed in the Trendelenburg position as described for internal jugular cannulation(head down 10\u00b0 to 15\u00b0). Prepare the skin overly-ing clavicle, sternum and neck to the angle ofthe mandible. A rolled towel placed between thepatient's shoulder blades to accentuate the stern-oclavicular joint is helpful. Anesthetize the skinand soft tissue overlying and just inferior to thejunction of the lateral and middle thirds of theclavicle. Insert the introducer needle 1 cm inferior to the clavicle, at a point at the junction of the lateraland middle thirds of the clavicle. Direct the needlemedially and cephalad, aiming for the supraster-nal notch (Figure A.4). Use a shallow angle to theskin and advance the needle just posterior to theclavicle. Once the vein is entered, blood shouldflow briskly into the syringe. Proceed with inser-tion of the guide wire and catheter. Obtain a chest radiograph to verify correct catheter position andthe presence of any complications. Femoral vein Femoral vein cannulation has the advantage that this location is away from the neck and thorax, andmay therefore be more accessible in the patientundergoing concurrent airway management orchest compressions. In addition, pneumothorax isnot a concern as with the other two approaches.In cases of intra-abdominal injury, though, use ofsites above the diaphragm is generally preferredto the femoral site. Place the patient supine, with the hip slightly externally rotated. Feel the femoral arterial Appendices 685Common A.4Subclavian vein cannulation.pulsation in the groin. The femoral vein lies just medial to the artery. When there is no palpablepulse, the artery can be expected to lie approxi-mately at the midpoint of a line between the anterior-superior iliac crest and the pubic tubercle. Prepare and drape the groin area in a sterile fashion. Anesthetize the skin and soft tissue inthe area of the femoral pulsation. Insert the intro-ducer A.5). The needle shouldbe angled at 45\u00b0 to the thigh. Aspirate as youadvance the needle. Venous blood should flowbriskly into the syringe when the femoral vein isentered. Reduce the angle to 20\u00b0 and advance theneedle an additional 2-3 mm to assure that theentire bevel lies within the femoral vein. Proceedwith insertion of the guide wire and catheter asdescribed previously. Complications of central venous cannulation Air embolism may occur if air enters the central circulation when the needle or catheter apertureis uncovered. The patient is particularly at risk tothis occurrence when the syringe is removed forpassage of the guide wire and when the catheteris attached to the IV apparatus. The risk of thiscomplication can be reduced by occluding thehub of the needle and catheter with the thumb atthese times. Catheter position should be checked by obtaining a chest radiograph soon after perform-ing the procedure. Malposition may consist ofthe catheter entering the wrong vein (e.g., theinternal jugular vein rather than the superiorvena cava in the subclavian technique), or knot-ting or kinking of the catheter. Arterial puncture is probably the most common complication of central venous cannulation. Thiscan be recognized by the appearance of brightred blood in the syringe and the presence of pul- satile flow. In puncture of the carotid artery dur-ing attempted internal jugular cannulation, aneck hematoma may be produced that can causetracheal compression. However, when either thefemoral or internal carotid artery is inadvertentlypunctured, the area around these vessels can bereadily compressed. This is not true of the sub- clavian vessels, and bleeding from the sub-clavian artery or vein can therefore be particularlyproblematic, producing a hemothorax. If a sub-clavian catheter is inadvertently placed in the thor-acic cavity, the fluid infused will extravasate intothe thorax. Appropriate catheter location shouldtherefore always be assured prior to beginninginfusion of IV fluids. If an insufficient length of guide wire is main- tained outside the skin puncture site, the wirecan migrate into the vessel and be lost in thevenous system. The guide wire can also break,especially if it is sheared against the needle whenthis is withdrawn. Insertion of the guide wiremay irritate the ventricle, especially theinternal jugular vein approaches.This may provoke ventricular premature beats. Ifthese appear on the cardiac monitor, the wireshould be withdrawn a few centimeters until theectopy ceases. Pneumothorax is a hazard in the internal jugular and subclavian vein approaches. It ismore likely to occur on the left side, because ofthe higher location of the left pleural dome. Afterperforming the procedure, examine the patientfor dyspnea, subcutaneous emphysema, trachealshift or unilateral reduction of breath sounds. Inaddition, obtain a post-procedural chest radio-graph. If an existing pneumothorax is known tobe present, perform the procedure on the sameside as this pneumothorax. Performing it on theopposite side places the patient at risk for bilat-eral pneumothoraces. Common emergency procedures 686 Appendices Figure A.5 Femoral vein cannulation with fingers on the pulse of the femoral artery.Infection is a possible complication of any venipuncture technique, but is more likely to lead to sepsis in central than peripheral venipuncture.Careful attention to sterile technique is thereforeparticularly important.

Intraosseous infusion Indications Infusion of fluid or medications via an intra- osseous (IO) line is usually reserved for acutelife-threatening situations, such as cardiac arrest,especially in instances in which IV access cannotbe obtained. Fluid that is infused into the bonemarrow enters the systemic circulation via nutri-ent and emissary veins. Crystalloid solutions,blood products and many drugs can be infusedwith nearly immediate absorption into the circu-lation. All drugs typically administered in car-diac arrest can be delivered via the IO route. The procedure is most often performed in children under 5 years of age, though it has been described as being used in adults as well.However, due to the nature of the mature mar-row, infusion is not as effective in adults. Equipment Sterile gloves and drapes Sandbag or rolled towel Povidone-iodine solution 1% lidocaine local anesthetic, needles and syringe Bone marrow aspiration needle (16- or 18-gauge) with trocar (if not available, use a lumbar puncture needle with stylet) Tape and gauze pads Clear medicine cupIV solution bag with tubing Pressure infusion pump Technique The procedure can be performed at a number of sites (distal femur, distal tibia, is describedhere at the proximal tibia, the site most often used.The insertion site is cm distal to the tibialtuberosity on the medial tibial surface. Prepare theskin in a sterile fashion with povidone-iodinesolution. Support the leg by placing a sandbag orrolled towel behind the knee. If time and clinical conditions permit, anesthesize the skin with lido-caine solution. Stabilize the leg with your non-dominant hand while holding the needle/trocar in the other. Insertthe needle into the skin nearly perpendicular tothe tibia but angled slightly away from the knee(Figure A.6). A commercial Jamshidi or otherbone marrow needle is preferred, but 18- or 20-gauge lumbar puncture needles may be used inchildren younger than 18 months. Use a rotatory motion with constant pressure to advance the needle into the bone. There is a sudden release of resistance when the needleenters the marrow cavity. When the needle is in themarrow, it should stand perpendicularly withoutsupport. Remove the trocar and confirm the posi-tion of the needle by aspirating a small amount ofmarrow, or by injecting a small volume of saline todetermine that there is minimal resistance and nosubcutaneous extravasation. Occasionally, mar-row may not return with aspiration, but placement is correct if fluid infuses without extravasation. Attach the IV solution apparatus. Re-examine the area for signs of extravasation. Place gauzepads around the needle, tape these down andapply a clear medicine cup to protect the needle. Appendices 687Common emergency procedures Figure A.6 Intraosseous cannulation proximal tibia.If necessary, apply a pressure pump to assist infusion. Complications There are few absolute contraindications to the procedure, but it should not be performed onpatients with osteogenesis imperfecta, into a bonethat has been fractured, or through infected skin.The most common complication is osteomyelitis,but even this is rare, being described in less than1% of most series. Other complications include sepsis, cellulitis, subcutaneous abscess, subcutaneous or sub-periosteal infusion of fluid, bony fracture, andgrowth plate injury. The needle may be bent dur-ing insertion. There have been a few reported casesof compartment syndrome following IO infusion,but this appears to be a rare complication. The likelihood of osteomyelitis can be reduced if the needle is left in place only long enough forresuscitation and stabilization, and by avoiding the procedure in bacteremic children. Subcuta-neous infiltration (and the risk of subsequent com-partment syndrome) can be minimized by careful observation of the infusion site. Infectious com-plications can be reduced by proper sterile tech-nique. Adherence to bony landmarks avoidsdamage to the epiphyseal plate. References Orlowski JP Emergency RW, Bodai FW, MM.

Arterial puncture Indications Arterial blood samples can provide important information regarding respiratory and acid-basestatus, including arterial pH, pCO 2, pO 2and bicar- bonate le vels. Such information is often sought in patients to assess respiratory and metabolic sta-tus, in those with significant respiratory comprom-ise, and in others who are severely ill.Contraindications Although there are no absolute contraindications, arterial puncture should be performed withextreme care in patients with the following:bleeding disorders or anticoagulation, severearterial disease in the area, as evidenced bydiminished pulse or audible bruit, evidence ofabsent collateral flow in areas where it normallyexists, and previous vascular surgery in the area.Do not perform arterial puncture through skinthat appears infected. When frequent blood sam-pling is anticipated, it may be preferable to insertan indwelling arterial catheter rather than per-forming arterial blood gas - Heparinized 25- or 27-gauge needles foranesthesia Local anesthetic solution Technique The blood sample is obtained with a 5-ml syringe,the barrel of which has been coated with heparin.If a prepackaged kit is used, the syringe alreadycontains heparin. When preparing the syringeyourself, draw 2 heparinized saline solu-tion (1000 IU/ml) into the syringe. Draw back theplunger to coat the barrel and needle, and theneject the remaining heparin. Select an arterial puncture site. Common sites are the radial, brachial and femoral arteries. Theradial artery at the wrist is the most commonlyused location (Figure A.7), though the femoralartery is often preferred in patients in circulatoryshock. For the radial artery, palpate the pulse at the wrist, placing the hand in approximately60\u00b0 of dorsiflexion. Avoid hyperextending thewrist, as this may place excessive traction on theartery, making the pulse more difficult to feel.The brachial pulse can be felt on the flexor aspectof the elbow, just proximal to the antecubitalfossa. The femoral artery enters the thigh afterpassing beneath the inguinal ligament; the pulsecan be felt in the groin, midway between theanterior-superior iliac spine and the pubic sym-physis. Common emergency procedures 688 AppendicesWhen the radial artery is considered, the Allen test should be performed to ascertain the adequacy of collateral ulnar flow. Perform the test as follows: 1.Palpate the radial and ulnar pulses at the wrist. 2.Compress both the arteries while having the patient repeatedly make a tight fist. 3.Instruct the patient to release the fist, andobserve for blanching of the palm. 4.Release your compression of the ulnar artery,noting the time it takes for blanching toresolve. This should normally occur within 5-10 seconds. When return of normal color to the palm is delayed, the adequacy of ulnar collateral flow can be questioned, and radial artery puncture shouldnot be performed. The Allen test requires acooperative patient. Moreover, even a normalAllen test does not guarantee the adequacy ofcollateral circulation. Prepare the skin overlying the puncture area with antiseptic solution. In the awake patient, youmay elect to anesthetize the skin by introducing asmall volume of 1% plain lidocaine via a 25- or27-gauge needle to make a small wheal. A largewheal may obscure the pulse. Palpate the pulse with the index and middle fingers of the non-dominant hand. Puncture theskin over the artery between these two fingers.Advance the needle at approximately a 45\u00b0 angleto the skin, parallel to the vessel. When the arteryis entered, allow the syringe to fill with the forceof arterial pressure. Obtain at least 3 ml of bloodfor analysis. If no blood is encountered or theblood does not readily advance the syringe's pis-ton, withdraw the needle and redirect it. Once blood sampling is completed, withdraw the needle and apply pressure over the puncturesite for at least 5 minutes. If the patient has acoagulopathy or is on anticoagulation therapy,apply pressure for 10-15 minutes. Expel any airbubbles present in the sample through the needleholding it upright, then plug the needle or capthe syringe to maintain anaerobic conditions. Complications Hematoma formation is the most common com- plication. This can be avoided by conscientiousapplication of pressure after the procedure iscompleted. In any event, such bleeding is usuallyminor. Infection at the site is another potential compli- cation. Serious infections, however, are uncom- mon. Although it has been postulated that thefemoral site is at particular risk to infectionbecause of proximity to the groin and perineum,no studies substantiate this. Puncture may induce arterial spasm, which in turn can produce ischemia and thrombus forma-tion. Such spasm usually causes transient ischemia,without significant sequelae in most cases. Nerve or venous injury from the needle is a potential complication. The femoral vein andnerve lie immediately to the medial and lateralsides of the artery, respectively. The mediannerve lies just to the ulnar side of the brachialartery at the antecubital crease. Passage of a nasogastric (NG) tube is performed for a variety of indications. A common reason isfor the purpose of evacuating the stomach of air(e.g., in gastric distention), gastric contents (intes-tinal obstruction, be placedto decompress the stomach of the trauma patientprior to performing a diagnostic peritoneal lavage.The tube may also be utilized as a conduit for Appendices 689Common emergency procedures Figure A.7 Radial artery puncture at the wrist.administration of medication to the patient who is unable to swallow. An example is the obtundedpoisoned patient to whom activated charcoal oran antidote needs to be administered. A16- or 18-French tube is appropriate for most purposes in adults. A larger tube may be neededfor evacuation of particulate material or bloodclots, but it may be necessary to pass such a tubevia the oral rather than the nasal route. Levine and Salem sump tubes are most com- monly used. The Levine tube has a single lumenat the tip, and is adequate for instillation of mater-ial into the stomach or diagnostic aspiration. TheSalem sump has a second vent lumen thatattaches to a blue pigtail extension. This ventallows outside air to be drawn into the stomach,thereby permitting continuous flow through thetube. The Salem sump is preferred for continuedsuction or lavage. Contraindications The presence of injury to the mid-face, with pos- sible fracture of the cribriform plate, constitutesan absolute contraindication to attempting pas-sage of an NG tube. This condition creates thedanger of passage of the tube into the cranium(Figure 6.20). Use of an orogastric tube should be considered in this setting. Do not attempt pas-sage of an NG tube in a comatose patient with an unprotected airway, as this risks aspiration.Coagulopathy and severe thrombocytopenia are relative contraindications, as significant nasal hemorrhage can be induced in these patients. Equipment Gloves, gown and mask NG tube Topical anesthetic/vasoconstricting liquid Lubricant jelly W ater and a flexible drinking straw 50-ml plain-tipped syringe Surgical tape 5-in-1 tapered adapter Technique Wear gloves, a gown and facial mask when per- forming the procedure. Position the patient in the sitting position when feasible, and elevate the backof the bed so that the patient does not withdrawthe head during insertion. Flex the neck slightly. Estimate the distance that the tube will have to traverse as follows: measure the distance fromthe tip of the nose to the earlobe and add the dis-tance from the earlobe to the xiphoid process. Thetube has graduated markings at various distancesfrom the distal end. Make note of the distanceyou have estimated relative to these markings.This distance is approximately 50-60 cm in thetypical adult. Underestimating the distance willresult in failure to pass the tube past the gastro- esophageal junction. Check the nostrils for patency by inspection and by asking the patient to inhale while occlud-ing each nostril in turn. When time permits, youmay anesthetize and constrict the nostril by apply-ing a (e.g., 4% cocaine solu-tion) to the nasal mucous spray)into the posterior diminish most patent naris by injecting5-10 ml of water-soluble lubricant jelly via asyringe. Coat the tip of the NG tube with this lubri-cant to a distance of about 6 cm from the tip. Insert the tip of the tube into the inferior por- tion of the nostril and aim it directly backward,perpendicular to the axis of the face (FigureA.8a). Slide the tube along the nasal floorbeneath the inferior turbinate. Do not direct itupward. Apply gentle pressure to advance thetube. Slight resistance may be encountered at the posterior nasopharynx. Have the patient sipsome water through a straw to facilitate thetube's passage through the esophagus. If thetube twists or kinks in the mouth, withdraw it tothe level of the nasopharynx to reattempt pas-sage. Do not remove it entirely. Once you have advanced the tube to the dis- tance previously determined, confirm its appro-priate position in the stomach. Rapidly insufflate20-50 ml of air into the tube via a syringe,simultan eously listening with a stethoscope over the epi gastrium (Figure A.8b). A rush of air will be audible as the air bolus enters the stomach. The egress of gastric contents through the tube is alsoan indication that the stomach has been intubated. Once the tube's appropriate position has been ascertained, anchor the tube in place by wrap-ping adhesive tape around it and securing it tothe nose. Apply a tapered 5-in-1 adapter andattach the tube to suction, if indicated. Complications An NG tube can be inadvertently passed though a fracture of the cribriform plate into the cranium.This is the reason that mid-facial trauma consti-tutes a contraindication to the procedure. The Common emergency procedures 690 Appendicestube can also enter the trachea rather than the esophagus. This usually causes profound cough-ing and misting of the tube with respiration.When this occurs, withdraw the tube immedi-ately and reattempt its passage. Rather than advancing into the esophagus, the tube may coil in the oropharynx. This is aparticularly common occurrence in the uncon-scious or uncooperative patient. The likelihoodof this is greater with smaller caliber tubes, andcan be diminished by using a larger tube or bycooling the tube in ice water prior to insertion,thereby rendering it stiffer. Injury to the nasopharynx is a relatively com- mon complication, producing a small amount ofbleeding. This is not cause for alarm. However,to avoid significant injury to the nasal mucosa,oropharynx or esophagus, only moderate pres-sure should be applied while advancing the tube.If nasal bleeding occurs, apply direct pressure tothe nose until this stops. Reference Boyes 1992;8:865-878. Bladder catheterization Indications Passage of a catheter into the bladder via the urethra may be necessary for a variety of reasons.Catheter placement may be required to relieveacute urinary retention due to mechanicalobstruction or neurologic disease. Similarly,post-voiding residual urine volume is assessedby passage of a urinary catheter in patients with incomplete bladder evacuation. An uncontamin-ated sample of urine for diagnostic analysis canbe obtained via catheterization. In some situations in which a diagnostic pelvic ultrasound is performed, fluid will needto be instilled into the bladder via a catheter toprovide an acoustic window for viewing pelviccontents. Prior to performance of diagnostic peri-toneal lavage, it is recommended that (absentcontraindications) the bladder be decompressedwith a catheter to avoid inadvertent injury. In some cases in which catheterization is performed for diagnostic urinalysis or urinaryresidual, a straight catheter can be inserted and promptly removed. In most other instances, aballoon-tipped (Foley) catheter is used, with theballoon inflated by injecting saline into the bal-loon port once the catheter is in the bladder andfree flow of urine occurs. Foley catheters of 14-,16- or 18-French sizes are most commonly usedin adults. An indwelling urinary catheter isimpera tive for monitoring the urine output in seriously ill patients. Core body temperature can be assessed continuously with catheters equippedwith temperature probes. Contraindications The most important contraindication is the pres- ence of acute urethral injury. Signs include the presence of a perineal hematoma, Appendices 691Common emergency procedures urethral meatus or a Commercially-packaged -urine collection system (tubing and bag) -surgical tape Technique The female patient Place the patient in the lithotomy position, with the knees flexed and the hips flexed andabducted. Apply sterile gloves. Drape the peri-neum. Soak the cotton balls with the antisepticsolution. Spread the patient's labia with the non-dominant hand, exposing the urethra. Graspinga cotton ball with the forceps, prepare the peri-urethral area by applying the povidone-iodinesolution over the meatus in an anterior to poster-ior direction. Repeat several times. Coat the tip of the catheter with lubricant. Gently introduce the catheter into the meatusand quickly advance it until about half its lengthhas been inserted. Urine should flow through thecatheter. Inflate the balloon with 10 ml of salinesolution. Pull the catheter back until the balloonis snug against the bladder. Attach the urine col-lection tubing and bag. Secure the catheter to theleg with tape. The male patient Place the patient in the supine position. Apply sterile gloves. Drape around the penis. Soak thecotton balls with the antiseptic solution. If thepatient is uncircumcised, retract the foreskin.Grasp the penis with the non-dominant hand,holding it perpendicular to the perineum. Grasp-ing a cotton ball with the forceps, prepare theperiurethral area by applying the povidone-iodinesolution over the meatus. Repeat several times.Coat the tip of the catheter with lubricant, and lubricate the urethra. Lidocaine jelly can be usedas a lubricant to lessen the discomfort of catheter-ization. Intr oduce the catheter into the meatus and quickly advance it until about half its lengthhas been inserted (Figure A.9). Urine should flowthrough the catheter. Inflate the balloon with 10 mlof saline solution. Pull the catheter back until the balloon is snug against the bladder. Attachthe urine collection tubing and bag. Secure thecatheter to the leg with tape. Complications Attempts to pass a catheter via a urethra that has been partially torn by a traumatic injury mayresult in complete urethral transection. For this reason, the clinical findings of urethral trauma must be sought, as their presence constitute con-traindications to catheterization. Microscopic and rarely gross hematuria may be produced by passage of a urinary catheter.Such bleeding is generally self-limited andrequires no treatment. Urinary tract infection can be introduced if sterile procedure is not followed. Occasionally it is difficult to pass a catheter into the bladder. This is most commonly the case in themale patient with an enlarged prostate. Use of aJ-tipped coude catheter or more advanced urologictechniques may be necessary in such cases.

Lumbar puncture Indications Lumbar puncture (LP) is used in emergency medicine primarily as a diagnostic tool formeningo-encephalitis and subarachnoid hemor-rhage. Although cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) find- ings obtained through this procedure may beuseful in assessing a number of other neurologicdiseases (e.g., multiple Guillain-Barresyndrome, neurosyphilis, pseudotumor cerebrior benign intracranial hypertension), these enti-ties are not commonly encountered in emergencypractice. Indications for LP vary according to the cli- nical setting. Although cranial computed tomog-raphy (CT) is extremely useful in the diagnosis ofsubarachnoid hemorrhage and various other conditions, there is no alternative diagnostic tech- nique to LP for detecting meningitis. A strong suspicion of the presence of meningitis calls for confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis by thismeans. LP is frequently used to exclude meningi-tis in infants with fever or following febrile con-vulsions. The indications for LP in these settingsare not standardized, and vary depending on theclinical presentation. Contraindications The procedure is contraindicated in the presence of skin or soft tissue infection overlying the punc-ture site because of the possibility of introducing infection into the CSF. Due to the risk of hemor-rhage, the procedure is also relatively contraindi- cated in patients with severe bleeding diathesis,thrombocytopenia (platelet counts of less than50,000/ /H9262l), and those anticoagulated. Spinal epidural or subdural hematomas are rarecomplications in such patients. If indications forLP are compelling, though, the procedure maybe performed after efforts are made to reversethe coagulopathy.The suspected presence of an intracranial mass (on the basis of clinical or CT findings) stands asa contraindication to the performance of lumbarpuncture. Removing CSF in such cases may reducelumbar pressure, causing a gradient that leads torostro-caudal displacement of cerebral structures. Rapid neurologic deterioration may follow. Equipment Prepackaged LP kits are available that generally contain the following: A 5-ml syringe with a 25-gauge needle 1% lidocaine Spinal needle with stylet Four tubes for collection of CSF Povidone-iodine antiseptic solution Pressure manometer with three-way stopcock Sterile drapes Gauze pads Adhesive bandage Technique Proper positioning is essential for successful LP . The procedure is generally performed with thepatient in the lateral position at the edge of the bedwith the knees, hips and neck flexed and the lowerback arched outward. The shoulders and hips arepositioned perpendicular to the bed. An assistant is usually needed to maintain the patient in this position. Avoid excessive flexion of the head, asthis can lead to airway obstruction or impede theflow of CSF, especially in neonates. If LP is unsuccessful in the lateral position, it may be attempted with the patient seated. Thismay be the most efficacious position for obesepatients. Have the patient lean forward, with thearms resting on a table or Mayo stand. CSF pres-sure in the seated position, however, is gravity-dependent, so the measurement of opening andclosing pressures is not clinically useful when theprocedure is done in the sitting position. Under sterile conditions, prepare the back with povidone-iodine solution and apply steriledrapes. Infiltrate the skin and soft tissue overly-ing the entry spot with 2-3 ml of 1% lidocainelocal anesthetic. Entry may be through the L 3-4or L 4-5 interspace. The L 3-4 interspace can belocated as being on a line connecting the poster-ior iliac crests. Use a styletted spinal needle ofappropriate size. This is usually a 20- or 22-gaugeneedle 3 12inches in length in adults and 25-gauge Appendices 693Common emergency proceduresneedle 112inches in length in small children. Introduce the spinal needle through an anes- thetic wheal in the midline of the spinous processes. Always ascertainthe midline by palpation rather than inspection. Advance the needle slowly with its bevel ori- ented horizontally and at a cephalad angle of20-30\u00b0 (Figure A.10). Direct the needle in theapproximate direction of the umbilicus. If bonyresistance is encountered, withdraw the needle and redirect it at a slightly different angle in thecephalo-caudad direction. A slight \"pop\" or \"give\"may be felt when the arachnoid space is entered.Once this occurs, advance the needle a few milli-meters further to ensure that the entire bevel lieswithin the subarachnoid space. Remove thestylet and observe if CSF flows from the needle.If it does not, rotate the needle 90\u00b0 to overcome apossible obstruction by a nerve root abuttingagainst the aperture. If no fluid returns, with-draw the needle almost to the skin edge and redi-rectit. If the patient complains of a sharp pain radiating to the leg, the needle may have struckone of the roots of the cauda equina. If thisoccurs, withdraw the needle and redirect it. If blood returns through the needle and does not clear, remove the needle and repeat the pro-cedure at another interspace. If the initial fluid isblood-tinged but subsequently clears, this is likelyto represent a traumatic tap, with the origin ofblood being the peridural venous plexus. This isnot generally a dangerous complication, and notreatment is required. When CSF appears in the hub of the needle, attach a three-way stopcock and manometer andmeasure the opening pressure. Straighten thepatient's legs and advise him to relax when thisis being done. Straining will increase intra-abdominal pressure, which in turn will spuri-ously elevate intracranial pressure. The fluidlevel in the manometer slightlywith respirations. Normal CSF opening pressureis 80-180 mmHg. If the opening pressure isextremely high (greater than 350 mmHg), add-itional fluid should not be withdrawn, unlessthat was the purpose of the procedure. Removethe needle, and use the fluid already in themanometer for analysis. In all other cases, allow fluid to drip sequen- tially into four tubes, with 1-2 ml of fluid in eachtube. Specific analytic tests performed on the CSFdepend to a degree on the clinical condition beingconsidered. However, analysis for cell count,glucose and protein level, Gram's stain, bacterialculture and xanthochromia should be done , a reddish or yellowish dis- coloration of CSF due to red cell lysis, is present in most cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Fluidin the first and fourth tubes should be used for cellcount, the second for culture, and the third for glu-cose and protein levels. Once sufficient fluid is collected, reinsert the stylet into the needle and withdraw the needle.Cover the puncture site with a sterile dressing.Maintain the patient in the recumbent positionfor the next 4 hours.

LP mayalso precipitate neurologic deterioration inpatients with spinal cord mass lesions. The most common complication of lumbar puncture is post-procedure headache, occurringin approximately 10-15% of patients in whomthe procedure is done. The etiology relates topersistent leakage of CSF through the duralpuncture site. This produces CSF hypotension,with resultant traction on the meninges, vessels,and other pain-sensitive structures at the base ofthe brain. The most characteristic feature is painthat is present in the upright position and relievedby lying down. Reference Sternbach GL. Lumbar puncture. Top Emerg Med 1988;10:1-7. Slit lamp examination Indications The slit lamp is a valuable instrument for examin- ing the anterior segment of the eye. It providespositional stabilization of the patient's head, withprojection of a light beam onto the eye. The exam-iner can evaluate each eye individually by binocu-lar inspection through the microscope eyepieces. Slit lamp examination allows a magnified evaluation of the cornea, conjunctiva and theanterior ocular chamber. It is useful for evalua-tion of injury to the eye, particularly for the diag-nosis of corneal abrasion, iritis, ocular foreignbodies and hyphema. Foreign body removalfrom the cornea and conjunctiva can be donemore precisely through the use of the slit lamp. Contraindications There are no contraindications to use of the instru- ment, but the examination cannot be done if the patient is unable to sit upright. Equipment Slit lamp Fluorescein stripsTechnique Seat the patient with the chin in the chin rest and the forehead braced against the headrest. Youmay accommodate the patient's comfort byadjusting the table and chin rest heights appro-priately. Turn the slit lamp on with the beam ini-tially directed over the bridge of the nose, toreduce patient discomfort. Swing the light source to the lateral side of the eye to be examined, posi-tioning it at a 45\u00b0 angle to the eye. Use a verti-cally-aligned light beam. Using the white light, set the light beam to the maximum height and minimum width. Focusthe beam of white light on the cornea by movingthe base of the slit lamp forward and backwardwith the joystick until the beam is sharpest on thepatient's cornea. Adjust the focus of the eye-pieces as you would for a regular microscopewhile viewing with each eye individually. Movethe base left and right to scan across the corneaand conjunctiva. The cornea can be evaluated forabrasions by instilling fluorescein onto the eyeand using the blue light filter. Widen the beam to3-4 mm for this use. Focus on the center of the cornea and then push the base slightly forward to focus on the anteriorsurface of the lens. The depth of the anterior cham-ber can be assessed in this way. Pull back on thejoystick to focus midway between the cornea andthe lens. The height of the light beam should be3-4 mm and as narrow as possible for this portionof the examination. Cells may be identified in theanterior chamber - inflammatory white blood cellsin iritis, red blood cells in microscopic hyphema.Inflammatory cells will look like specks of dust;red blood cells will look like brown particles. Intraocular pressure may be measured using the applanation tonometer device found on mostslit lamp microscopes. This technique requires a cooperative patient and the use of a topicalanesthetic and fluoroscein stain. It is advised tocompare pressure measurements between eyes,provided no contraindications exist (infection,ruptured globe). Complications None. References Harlan JB, Pieramichi DJ.

Reduction of dislocations Shoulder Indications The indication for this procedure is the presence of a dislocation of the glenohumeral joint of theshoulder. This is a common dislocation, often theresult of athletic injury or falls. The reason for the frequency of this injury is the lack of intrinsicbony stability of the glenohumeral joint, as wellas its wide range of motion. The diagnosis is usually obvious on clinical grounds. The arm is held in slight abduction andexternal rotation, and range of motion is absentor severely limited. There is a loss of the normalrounded appearance of the shoulder, with a step-off deformity and squared appearancerevealing the prominence of the acromion process. Though there is some controversy as to whetherradiographs should be done in atraumatic shoul-der dislocations, they should be performed in alltraumatic injuries resulting in dislocation.Contraindications None. Equipment Sheets to use for countertraction Medication and equipment for IV analgesia and sedation Technique There are a number of techniques for reductionof shoulder dislocations. Each has its advocates,and practitioners should be familiar with severalmethods. Administration of parenteral analgesia,muscle relaxants or procedural sedation is neces-sary in many cases. The traction-countertraction technique is a fre- quently utilized method (Figure A.11). Position the patient supine with a folded sheet wrappedaround the chest and under the axilla. Have anassistant apply countertraction with this sheet,and apply steady traction along the axis of thehumerus with the shoulder abducted slightly. Itmay take several minutes of continued tractionfor the reduction to be effective. In the external rotation method, place the patient supine and support the elbow with one Common emergency procedures 696 Appendices Figure A.11 Traction-countertraction technique for shoulder reduction.Appendices 697Common emergency procedures Figure A.12 External rotation method of shoulder reduction. hand (Figure A.12). Adduct the shoulder and apply longitudinal traction. Slowly and gentlyexternally rotate the shoulder. Once the shoulderis externally rotated to 90\u00b0, slowly abduct theshoulder until reduction occurs. For the scapular manipulation technique, place the patient prone, with the arm hanging offthe bed (Figure A.13). Apply downward tractionto the arm. Push the inferior tip of scapula medi-ally while stabilizing the superior portion of thescapula. Unlike other methods, this approachattempts reduction by reorienting the glenoidfossa rather than repositioning the humeral head. Following reduction, ascertain the proper position of the shoulder through post-reductionradiographs. Immobilize the patient in a slingand swath or shoulder immobilizer. Repeat aneurovascular examination and document theresults in the medical record. Complications Injury to the axillary nerve occurs in approxi- mately 10% of cases of shoulder dislocation. Thisusually represents a traction neuropraxia, whichhas favorable prognosis for recovery of nervefunction. To assure that the nerve has not beeninjured during the reduction process, it isimportant to test for its function prior to attemptsat reduction, and to document the results of thisexamination in the medical record. The sensoryportion of the nerve provides sensation over thelateral portion of the shoulder (the \"militarypatch\" distribution). Test sharp sensation overthis area with a pin. The motor portion of theaxillary nerve innervates the deltoid muscle.Have the patient attempt shoulder abduction.Feel the contraction of the deltoid muscle byplacing your hand over it. Fracture of the humeral head may occur as a consequence of reduction. Radial head subluxation Indications Indication for this procedure is the presence of an acute radial head subluxation in a child. This is avery common childhood injury, seen most oftenbetween the ages of 1 and 5 years, with a peak incidence between ages 2-3 years. It is usuallythe result of sudden traction being applied to aCommon emergency procedures 698 Appendices 12 3 (a) Figure A.13 Scapular manipulation. child's hand or forearm. This typically occurs when a parent pulls a child up by the arm duringplay or to prevent a fall. This condition is alsoreferred to as \"nursemaid's elbow.\" It results in the pulling of the annular ligament over theradial head, with the interposition of this liga-ment (which maintains the radius in its normalrelationship relative to the humerus and ulna) between the radius and the humeral capitellum. The result is usually acute pain and unwill- ingness by the child to move the arm. The arm isheld in slight flexion and pronation. Any attemptat motion is resisted by the child. Contraindications None. Equipment None. Technique Support the elbow and forearm with one hand, and place the thumb of the other hand over thearea of the radial head. Simultaneously, slowly flexthe elbow and supinate the forearm. An audibleor palpable click may be perceived with reduction.The child usually becomes pain-free and movesthe arm normally shortly after reduction. Given theappropriate mechanism and successful reduc-tion,neither radiographs nor immobilization is necessary. Complications Recurrence of the subluxation occasionally occurs. Phalangeal IndicationsDislocations of the interphalanageal and metacar- pophalangeal joints are common injuries, often occurring during sports activities or falls. Bayonet-shaped or angulated deformities of the fingersare usually readily identified, and constituteindication for reduction. When a skin lacerationaccompanies the injury, irrigation of the woundand debridement of devitalized tissue may haveto follow reduction. Such lacerations may needto be sutured after reduction is completed, andrequire antibiotics. (b)Contraindications None. Equipment Local anesthetic Syringe and 27-gauge needle Technique Reduction may require a digital nerve block, though it may be accomplished without anesthe-sia if the patient is stoic and not too much timehas elapsed since the injury. Apply longitudinaltraction with slight hyperextension (exaggerat-ing the deformity) (Figure A.14). Reduction by a \"click\" and resolu-tion of the deformity. Apply an immobilizingsplint.Complications Some dislocations, especially those of the metacar- pophalangeal joints, may involve the interpos- ition of soft tissue between the dislocated bones.Such dislocations resist the usual methods ofreduction, and require operative management. Repeated attempts at closed reduction may pro-duce damage to the soft tissues. Patella Indications Dislocation of the patella usually results from a laterally-directed force applied to the medialside of the kneecap. The knee is often partiallyflexed at the time of injury. The displacement ofthe patella on the lateral aspect of the knee pro-duces a dramatic deformity. The presence of dis-location constitutes an indication for reduction.Neurovascular impairment is rarely a feature ofthis injury. Contraindications None. Equipment None. Technique Although parenteral sedation may be helpful in reducing muscular spasm and pain, the reduction can often be achieved without administration ofany medication. Apply medially-directed pres-sure over the lateral border of the patella com-bined with extension of the knee (Figure A.15).The patella can be felt to snap into place as reduc-tion occurs. Following reduction, immobilize theknee using a knee immobilizer or a posteriorplaster splint. Complications Though there are rarely any complications from the procedure itself, a traumatic joint effusionmay follow this injury. Damage to the medialsupporting ligaments of the patella may occur,leading to a predisposition for recurrent dislo-cation.

Tube thoracostomy Indications Tube thoracostomy (chest tube) is performed to remove blood (hemothorax), fluid (pleural effu- sion or empyema) or air (pneumothorax) from the pleural space. The clinical circumstances must beassessed in each case, though, as not all patientswith a pneumothorax or pleural effusion requireevacuation with a chest tube. Thoracostomy tubes come in various sizes. Larger tubes (30-40 French) are needed forevacuation of a hemothorax, whereas relativelysmaller ones (12-22 French) are likely to be ade-quate in the treatment of pneumothorax. Theusual placement site for a thoracostomy tube isthe fifth or sixth intercostal space in the mid-axillary line. For pneumothorax, a small tube issometimes placed in the mid-clavicular line inthe second intercostal space. Contraindications There are no absolute contraindications to insertion of a chest tube, provided the appropri-ate indications are present. Some relative con-traindications exist. Coagulopathy is one ofthese, and the patient with a prolonged pro-thrombin time or thrombocytopenia should havethese abnormalities corrected prior to chest tubeinsertion. In massive hemothorax, pleural blood may act to tamponade a site of bleeding. Insertion of athoracostomy tube in such circumstances mayprecipitate massive hemorrhage once the tam-ponade effect is removed. Such patients shouldbe considered for open thoracotomy to controlbleeding prior to chest tube insertion. Equipment Sterile gloves and drapes Povidone-iodine antiseptic solution Common emergency procedures 700 Appendices Figure dislocated epinephrine Syringe and needles Scalpel with No. 10 blade Large curved scissors Large and medium Kelly clamps Chest tubes W ater seal drainage apparatus (Pleuravac\u00ae) with tubing and serrated connector Needle holder Silk 1-0 suture V aseline-impregnated gauze Gauze pads (4 /H110034) Adhesive tape Technique Prior to initiating the procedure, fill the drainageapparatus with water to the indicated levels.Place the patient in the supine or semi-uprightposition. In the awake and hemodynamically sta-blepatient, consider administering IV analgesics and sedatives to make the procedure less painful.Raise the patient's arm above the head on the sideused. Put on sterile gloves. Prepare the skin withpovidone-iodine solution and drape in a sterilefashion. Anesthetize the skin over the insertionsite by injecting lidocaine with epinephrine anes-thetic. Infiltrate deeper using a long 25-gaugeneedle to infiltrate the subcutaneous tissue, muscleand parietal pleura. As much as 20-40 ml of localanesthetic may be required. Make a 2-3 cm incision over the rib, with the axis of the incision parallel to the rib (FigureA.16a). Bluntly dissect the subcutaneous tissues,using the Kelly clamp or large scissors to separatethe tissue by opening and spreading the instru-ment. Perform the dissection over the top of therib to avoid the subcostal neurovascular bundle.The dissection tunnel should be large enough toadmit your index finger. Direct the dissection in acaudad direction. Penetrate the parietal pleurawith a clamp (Figure A.16b). After penetratingthe pleura, open the clamp to expand the open-ing, and then remove the clamp in the open pos-ition. Insert your index finger through the pleuralopening to assure the absence of adhesions andabdominal organs, and so as not to \"lose\" thehole's location (Figure A.16c). Clamp the end of the chest tube with a large clamp and guide the tube through the dissectedtunnel into the pleural space (Figure A.16d).Direct it cephalad and posteriorly, and advanceuntil all the side holes over the distal portion are Appendices 701Common emergency procedures (a) Intercostal artery, vein and nerve Lung (b)Pleural space Figure A.16 The thoracostomy (a) incision, (b) clamp penetration.within the thoracic cavity. Remove the clamp. Fluid (pleural effusion) or blood (hemothorax)should now enter the tube. In the case of pneumo-thorax, condensation of air will be seen on thewalls of the tube coincident with respiration.Connect the tube to the water seal drainageapparatus. Tape the junction of the tube and theserrated connector. Secure the tube to the skin with a purse-string suture, wrapping the suture around the end ofthe tube before cutting the ends. Cover the inser-tion site with Vaseline-impregnated gauze.Apply a dressing of 4 /H110034 gauze pads. Tape the dressing and also tape a section of the tube inplace to the skin. Obtain a post-procedure chestradiograph to assess for the proper position andfunction of the tube. The chest tube has a radio-opaque stripe along its side to aid in radio-graphic identification.Complications Patients with severe chronic obstructive pul- monary disease may have large pulmonary bullaethat may be mistaken for pneumothoraces.Insertion of a chest tube in this instance canworsen pulmonary function. Failure to suture and tape the tube to the chest may result in accidental extrusion of the tube.Failure to tape the connections may cause separ-ation of the chest tube from the water sealdrainage apparatus, resulting in recurrence ofthe pneumothorax. Failure to assure that all of the side holes of the thoracostomy tube are positioned within thepleural space causes aspiration of air from apneumothorax into the soft tissue of the chest,producing subcutaneous emphysema. Passageof the tube into the subcutaneous tissue procedures 702 Appendices(d) (c) Figure A.16 ( cont ) (c) insertion of finger and (d) insertion of chest tube using curved clamp.than the pleural space will fail to evacuate the space of fluid or air. Bleeding may occur if an intercostal artery or vein is lacerated during the procedure. The lowerborder of the rib should be avoided as a site ofincision to avoid these vessels. Intercostal nervescan be injured in similar fashion. Other intratho-racic vessels can be injured during insertion ofthe tube, and the tube should not be forcedthrough the subcutaneous tunnel or into thepleural space. Laceration of lung adherent to thepleura, liver and other abdominal organs canoccur. The entry site through the pleura shouldbe palpated prior to insertion of the tube to avertsuch complications.

Cervical spine clearance Indications Evaluating the patient for evidence of injury to the cervical spine is an important part of clinicaltrauma assessment. As spinal injury can producecatastrophic neurologic consequences, radio-graphs of the spine are commonly ordered forinjured patients. The determination that a patientis at minimal risk of spinal injury, and does notrequire radiographic assessment involves a clinical determination to \"clear\" the spine of furtherimmobilization and imaging. Contraindications Due to the clinical importance of this procedure, it must always be done by an experienced practi-tioner. To be recognized as being at low risk forcervical spine injury, the patient must meet all ofthe following criteria: There is no tenderness to palpation of the bones of the cervical spine. The patient has no deficit on neurologicexamination or complaint of such deficit byhistory. The patient shows no evidence of beingintoxicated with alcohol or other drugs thatcan affect level of consciousness.There is a normal level of alertness allowingthe patient to fully comprehend and co-operate with the examination. The patientshould be oriented to person, place and time,and should not exhibit inappropriate ordelayed responses to external stimuli. There are no painful injuries elsewhere on thebody that could distract the patient fromrecognizing the pain associated with a neck injury. Equipment None. Technique Assure that the above conditions are met. Palpate the midline of the neck posteriorly fromthe nuchal ridge to the prominence of the firstthoracic vertebra. If the patient complains of anypain on this palpation, cervical radiographs areindicated. If there is no such tenderness and the patient meets all the other conditions, remove any cer-vical immobilization devices without having thepatient move his or her neck. Instruct the patientto very slowly flex the neck to the greatest degreepossible, instructing him to stop if any painoccurs. If the patient can do this, have him extend the neck as much as possible, again instructinghim to terminate efforts with any discomfort.Repeat the procedure with the patient them-selves turning the head to the right and then theleft. In each instance, movement should bestopped if any discomfort is produced. If thepatient can perform full range of motion maneu-vers painlessly in the absence of the above miti-gating criteria, the presence of cervical spineinjury can be excluded on clinical grounds. Complications Exacerbating cervical injury by allowing neck movement is the major complication. Wheneverany doubt exists to the possibility of spinalinjury, it should be assessed through radio-graphic imaging. References Hoffman JR, Mower WR, Wolfson AB, et al.

Abscess incision and drainage Indications Indication for this procedure is the presence of a cutaneous or subcutaneous abscess (a collectionof inflammatory and infectious products encap-sulated by granulation tissue). The clinical hall-mark is a tender mass that shows fluctuance -the liquid nature of the contents can be palpatedthrough the skin. In most patients, a cutaneousabscess constitutes a local infection caused byskin flora. Contraindications There are no absolute contraindications to per- forming incision and drainage of an abscess. Ifthere is evidence of local infection (e.g., redness, swelling), but no fluctuance, the procedure may be delayed until after a trial of antibiotic therapy. In the face and other areas where a scar is unde-sirable, repeated aspiration may be an alternativeto incision and drainage. In the septic or severelyimmune compromised patient, the proceduremay have to be delayed until after antibiotictherapy is initiated. Equipment Sterile gloves Local anesthetic solution, syringe and needles Eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) gel Sterile drapes Povidone-iodine antiseptic solution Irrigating syringe tape 14or 12-inch width) Scalpel with No. 11 blade HemostatScissors Gauze pads Technique Prepare and drape the area in sterile fashion.Performing incision and drainage is anextremely painful procedure, and it may be diffi-cult to achieve adequate local anesthesia. Applya layer of EMLA gel over the area of fluctuance.Cover this with a patch of Tegaderm or clearplastic wrap. After a period of 30-60 minutes,inject local across thedome of the abscess (Figure A.17a). Using ascalpel with a No. 11 blade, make an incisionover the area of maximal fluctuance and extend itinto the abscess cavity (Figure A.17b). Gently probe the cavity with a hemostat to free all loculated tissue (Figure A.17c). This may be themost painful portion of the procedure, as skin infil-tration will not provide anesthesia in the depths ofthe cavity. Irrigate the abscess cavity with saline Common emergency procedures 704 AppendicesLocal anesthesia (a) Incision (b) (c) Figure A.17 Abscess infiltration, incision and drainage.solution. Pack the wound with ribbon tape. Do not pack the cavity tightly, as this may trap purulentmaterial. Apply a gauze dressing. Complications Whenever an incision is made in skin, there is risk of injury to surrounding tissue. Infection can be spread into adjacent tissue or the bloodstream by abscess drainage.Inadequately probing the interior of the abscesscavity may result in the reaccumulation of infec-tious fluid and return of symptoms.

Appendices 705Common emergency proceduresAppendices 707Wound preparation Overview Management of a laceration before and after wound closure plays as important a role as theactual act of wound repair itself. Wound infection,which occurs in approximately 3-7% of all trau-matic wounds, wound dehiscence, and poor cos-mesis directly relate to the adequacy of woundpreparation. The approach to proper wound man-agement can be categorized into the following steps: setup, anesthesia, wound cleaning, local wound preparation, and post-closure wound care. Setup Preparation of both the patient and provider is ess-ential in any case requiring wound management.Patient preparation includes: 1.Establishing sufficient lighting for good wound visualization. 2.Placing the patient in a reclined or semi-reclined position to anticipate a possible vasovagal event from pain or anxiety. 3.Positioning the patient so that the wound ismost accessible to the provider, such asraising the patient's gurney to the provider'swaist level. Provider preparation primarily involves usinguniversal precautions, including a gown, face oreye protection, and gloves. This becomes especiallyimportant during wound irrigation, when high-pressure irrigation fluid may splash blood-borneproducts unpredictably. Anesthesia After a complete neurovascular examination distal to the wound, the next step is anesthetizingthe wound. This allows the provider to meticu-lously irrigate, explore, and examine tendonfunction before closure now that patient discom-fort is no longer a limiting factor. According to alarge American College of Emergency Physicians'study of medicolegal claims from the emergencydepartment (ED), missing retained foreign bodiesin wounds is the fifth leading cause of lawsuits. Lidocaine and the longer-acting bupivacaine are the two most commonly used anesthetic agents.Both share onset of pain relief in 2-5 minutes.Lidocaine lasts for approximately 1-2 hours, bupi-vacaine lasts 4-8 hours. For the pediatric popula-tion, seemingly small volumes of an anestheticmay be toxic for the patient. It is therefore impor-tant to calculate the toxic anesthetic dose prior toadministration (Table B.1). Lidocaine and bupiva-caine toxicity can cause seizures, dysrhythmias,and cardiac arrest. The concurrent use of epineph-rine improves hemostasis and reduces systemicanesthetic absorption by the mechanism of localvasoconstriction. Traditionally, epinephrine shouldnot be used for end-circulation anatomic areas, including the fingers, toes, ears, nose, and penis. Appendix B Wound preparation Michelle Lin, MD Table B.1 Local anesthetic toxicity Adult example Toxic dose Toxic volume for typical 70 kg adult patient Bupivacaine 3 mg/kg Using 0.25% bupivacaine: (3 % (10 mg/ml) /H1100549 ml Pediatric example Toxic dose To xic volume for a 2-year-old child (12 kg) with a leg laceration Lidocaine 4.5 mg/kg Using 1% (10 mg/ml) /H110055.4 ml Note: The provider should not use more than 5.4 ml, or 54 mg of lidocaine.Wound preparation 708 AppendicesAstudy by Whilhelmi et al. demonstrated that dig- its injected with lidocaine /H11001epinephrine had no added complications compared to lidocaine alone, suggesting that this dictum may be overconserva-tive. For those \"allergic\" to these anesthetics, car-diac lidocaine, which is preservative-free, may beused. If a true lidocaine allergy exists, 1% diphen-hydramine can serve as an effective alternativeagent, although it causes relatively more pain onadministration. There are four different approaches to achieve wound anesthesia. Topical Topical anesthesia can be used as the sole means of anesthetizing a wound, or it may be used in conjunction with local infiltration. Due tothe high vascularity of the face and scalp, topicalanesthetics are most effective in this area. Twocommercially-prepared agents are TAC (a mix-ture of tetracaine, adrenaline/epinephrine, andcocaine) and LET (a mixture of lidocaine, epi-nephrine, and tetracaine). TAC has been associ-ated with several case reports of seizures anddeath from inadvertent mucosal absorption ofcocaine; as a result, it is unavailable in most EDs. Acotton ball soaked with approximately 3-5 ml of the anesthetic agent is applied to the openwound for at least 10 minutes. To maximizeabsorption, apply firm pressure with a strongadhesive tape. Alternatively, for the frightenedpediatric patient, a family member can weargloves and apply the cotton ball to the patient'slaceration. The presence of blanched woundedges marks successful absorption of anesthetic,as absorption of epinephrine from TAC or LETcauses local wound vasoconstriction. Cautionshould be taken with application around the eyes,to prevent inadvertent corneal exposure. Local infiltration Local infiltration, the most common approach toanesthesia in wound care, involves injecting ananesthetic into both wound edges at the dermal-subcutaneous layer. Starting at one apex, deposita small amount of anesthetic in the subcutaneoustissue within the wound. This is not done throughintact epidermal skin, as penetrating intact skinis more painful. Be sure to check for inadvertentvascular cannulation by aspirating for bloodbefore instilling anesthetic. Advance the needleto its full length along one wound edge. Depositanesthesia while retracting the needle out of theskin. Reinsert the needle at the leading edge ofanesthesia and continue this process circumfer-entially around the wound (Figure B.1). Five different techniques can reduce the pain of anesthetic infiltration. 1.Premedicate the wound with a topical anesthetic (described above) or ice. Thispartially anesthetizes the wound edgesbefore injecting with the needle. 2.As local anesthetics such as lidocaine and bupivacaine are weak acids, mixing the medication with bicarbonateproduces a more neutral pH and less painful anesthetic. For 1% lidocaine, mix 1ml of 8.4% bicarbonate with 9 ml of the anesthetic. For bupivacaine, mix 0.1 ml of 8.4% bicarbonate with 9.9 ml of theanesthetic. Excess bicarbonate bupivacaine may cause soluteprecipitation. 3.Warm the anesthetic syringe in your hand for several minutes to room temperature toreduce the pain of infiltration. 4.Inject the local anesthetic with the smallestdiameter needle. A 30-gauge needle ispreferred. 5.Slow the rate of medication injection, as painresults when the soft tissue stretches.123456 Figure B.1 Local anesthetic infiltration technique. Local infiltration first starts with a subcutaneous wheal of anesthetic at one apex from within the wound (Syringe 1 on bottom left). Subsequent injections (Syringe 2-6) along the wound edge start at the leading edge of anesthesia. The process should becontinued for the other side of the wound for completeanesthesia.Appendices 709Wound preparationRegional block Amore elegant technique in wound anesthesia is a regional nerve block, where anesthesia is administered proximal to the wound site to blocksensory innervation to the affected area. The pri-mary advantage of this approach is the preserva-tion of wound edges. Comparatively, localanesthetic infiltration often distorts landmarks.This factor is especially crucial when woundedges are under tension or poorly approximated. The most commonly used regional block is the digital block. Other regional blocks anesthetizethe supraorbital, regional anesthesia is famil-iarity with the anatomy and proper technique. The digital block anesthetizes an entire digit distal to the metacarpal-phalangeal or metatarsal-phalangeal joint. Each finger has an ulnar and radial digital nerve, located along the ulnar andradial volar (palmar) aspect of the digit, respec-tively. Each toe has a similar medial and lateraldigital nerve located along the plantar aspect ofthe digit. In cross-section, these nerves lie atapproximately the 4 and 8 o'clock positions of a digit with the surface of the fingernail or toenail at 12 o'clock. As a consequence, two injec-tions are required for adequate anesthesia. First,after positioning the patient's hand or foot on aflat surface with the dorsal aspect facing up,insert the needle at the level of the web space. Ata 45\u00b0 angle aiming volarly, insert the needlealong the proximal phalanx bone to reach thefirst digital nerve. After aspirating to check forinadvertent vascular cannulation, inject1-2 ml of the anesthetic. Remember to avoidusing epinephrine. Repeat this process for theopposite digital nerve. For the thumb and greattoe, a subcutaneous line of anesthesia should alsobe deposited to block the superficial branchessupplying the dorsal part of the digit (Figure B.2). Procedural sedation Although the topic of procedural sedation exceedsbeyond the scope of this section, it providesanother option for wound closure. This option isprimarily reserved for pediatric patients who can-nottolerate local or regional anesthesia because of emotional distress or concerns of anesthetictoxicity. Common agents include ketamine (forchildren less than 10 years old), propofol, etomi-date, or a combination of fentanyl and midazolam.While the patient is sedated, a local or regionalanesthetic may be administered for pain relief dur-ingthe procedure and after the patient awakens. Despite improved cosmetics from patient immobilization and decreased psychologictrauma, pr ocedural sedation does not come with- out risks. One disadvantage is a longer ED stayfor the patient, because the patient must have hadnothing by mouth for 4-6 hours prior to the seda-tion, and usually requires time for the sedation towear off following the procedure. Depending onthe procedural sedation agent used, risks includeagitation, vomiting, respiratory depression andapnea. A complete discussion of procedural seda-tion can be found in Appendix D. Wound cleaning Cleaning the wound prior to wound closurereduces the incidence of infection. Although a variety of irrigation solutions have been studiedto minimize wound infection, the current stan-dard is sterile normal saline with high-pressureirrigation. The type of solution used for irriga-tion may not be important; several studies haveshown equal efficacy using tap water versus ster-ile normal saline. However, high pressure irriga- tion is the cornerstone of wound cleaning. By applying at least a 7 psi force to the wound, theirrigation fluid dislodges foreign bodies, contam-inants, and bacteria. Although many commer-cially available kits can provide high-pressureirrigation, a simple device can be made by usinga 30 ml syringe and an 18-gauge angiocatheter.Irrigation with this setup delivers over 7 psi ofpressure (Figure B.3). Low-pressure irrigation,= Digital nerve1 2 3 Figure B.2 Regional anesthesia: digital nerve block. A digital nerve block can be achieved with injections at Sites 1 and 2. For the thumb and great toe, a thirdsubcutaneous line of anesthesia (Site 3) is necessary toblock superficial dorsal sensory nerves.such as squeezing fluid out of a puncture hole made in a saline bottle, is inadequate. Althoughno studies have looked at the ideal irrigation vol-ume, a common practice is to irrigate about100 ml for every 1 cm of wound length. Slightlymore irrigant may be used for distal extremity orcontaminated wounds, which have a higher inci-dence of infection, and slightly less for facial andscalp wounds, which have a much lower inci-dence. Hollander et al. suggest that facial andscalp wounds require minimal, if any, irrigationprior to wound closure because the high vascu-larity of these areas significantly reduces the inci-dence of wound infection. There was also addedbenefit of improved cosmesis without irrigationbecause high-pressure irrigation caused unnec-essary soft tissue swelling and damage. There are two common misconceptions in wound cleaning. The first error is swabbingpovidone-iodine or chlorhexidine into the woundfor further sterilization. Studies have shown that although they impede bacterial growth, theyare also cytotoxic and impair wound defenses.Thus, if using these agents, be sure to swab onlythe intact skin adjacent to the wound but not inthe wound itself. A second error is to scrub thewound vigorously before wound closure. Thisinjures underlying viable soft tissue and impairsoptimal wound healing. Unless there are multiplesmall foreign bodies embedded in the skin, suchas gravel, scrubbing is not recommended. Local wound preparation After anesthesia and irrigation, the wound shouldbe examined under ster ile conditions to maintain sterility and to reduce the risk of wound infec- tion. Careful wound exploration should checkfor the presence of foreign bodies and involve-ment of more complex structures, such as tendon,muscle, joint capsule, and bone. Three problems commonly arise during wound preparation. The first is bleeding, especially afterwound irrigation. This is when early clots maybecome dislodged, and ongoing venous or arte-rial bleeding prevents adequate visualization ofthe wound. Hemostasis can usually be achievedby applying direct external pressure for severalminutes. Persistent bleeding despite direct pres-sure can be approached by applying a tourniqueton an extremity proximal to the wound for nomore than 60 minutes. The cuff pressure should be above the patient's systolic blood pressure.Patients often will not tolerate this tight tourni- quet for more than 20-30 minutes. Addition ally, in wounds that ooze slowly, an anesthetic with epi-nephrine can be used to wash over the woundand achieve transient vasoconstrictive hemosta-sis before wound closure. Following thoroughexploration, wound repair and closure itself willgenerally stop further bleeding. Another common problem with wound prepa- ration is the pr oximity of hair to the wound. Hair strands should not become trapped in the woundduring closure, to avoid a foreign body reaction.Hair should not be shaved, because this increasesthe rate of wound infection, providing a portal forbacterial entry. Eyebrow hair should never be cutor shaved because it grows slowly and irregularlyafter being cut, causing cosmetic asymmetry forthe patient. Furthermore, eyebrows assist withwound edge approximation by serving as a land-mark for skin edges. Instead, for lacerations nearhair, apply a thin coat of a sterile petroleum-basedjelly in the hair, such as neosporin or bacitracin,and mat the hair away from the wound edges. Athird problem frequently encountered in wound preparation is the presence of devitalizedtissue along a wound edge. Nonviable tissue alongwound edges impairs wound healing, because itcan provide a nidus for infection. Excisional Wound preparation 710 Appendices Figure B.3 Wound irrigation equipment. A commercially-available unit (middle) or a syringe with an 18-gauge angiocatheter (right) can deliver high-pressure irrigation to a wound.debridement of devitalized tissue can also allow more precise reapproximation of wound edges.Be careful of over-debridement, which may createexcessive wound tension upon closure. Debride-ment near tendons and peripheral nerves may cause additional iatr ogenic injuries. Post-closure wound care Continued care after wound closure plays an inte-gral r ole in optimal wound healing. In order to prevent contamination and limit scab formation ofthe wound, apply a dressing consisting of a topicalantibiotic ointment underneath a dry sterile gauze.For tissue adhesives, petroleum-based productsshould not be applied because they can degradethe adhesive and cause wound dehiscence. Whenapplying a circumferential wound dressing, wrapthe site loosely to avoid a tourniquet-like ef fect from inevitable soft tissue swelling. For wounds overlying joint surfaces, which may dehiscewhen the joint is flexed or extended, a splintshould be applied to prevent range of motion ofthe joint. Providers should not prescribe prophylactic systemic antibiotics for simple lacerations andwounds. The primary means of reducing woundinfection is sterile irrigation, scrupulous woundexploration, and meticulous wound closure, notantibiotics. However, antibiotics are indicated inspecial high-risk cases (Table B.2). Discharge paperwork for the patient should include explicit instructions on wound care man-agement, as well as specific comments about thepossibility of wound infection (Table B.3). For thewound at higher risk of infection, such as a con-taminated laceration of a finger, a human bite of anextremity, or a traumatic wound with devitalizedtissue, a scheduled wound check within 48 hoursis prudent to look for early signs of infection.Pitfalls in wound care Although wound irrigation may be time-consuming, it plays a significant role inminimizing infection. Do not underestimatethe importance of high-pressure irrigationand meticulous wound exploration beforewound closure. Regional blocks are vastly underutilized inproviding anesthesia prior to wound closure.When compared to local infiltration ofanesthesia, these offer the significantadvantages of preserving landmarks and not increasing wound tension. Efforts should be taken not to shave hair adjacent to a wound. Instead, splay hair tuftsaway from the wound edges using a sterilepetroleum-based product. Povidone-iodine and chlorhexidineswabbing for wound sterilization shouldoccur only over intact skin. If applied into thewound itself, these may cause tissue damageand delay wound healing. Systemic antibiotics are not routinelyindicated and frequently over-prescribed for simple lacerations. Careful discharge instructions to the patientshould warn about the possibility of woundinfection and scarring. They should also Appendices 711Wound preparation Injury /H110226 hours old on the extremities Injury /H1102224 hours old on the face and scalp Tendon, joint, or bony involvement Cartilage involvement Mammalian bite Co-morbid disease (diabetes mellitus, extremes of age, steroid use, morbid obesity) Puncture wound Complex intraoral woundTable B.2 Indications for systemic antibiotics for traumatic woundsKeep your wound elevated above the level of your heart to reduce tissue swelling. For sutures :Keep the wound dressing on and dry for 24 hours to prevent wound contamination. Afterward, change the dressing using dry gauze ora bandage. Gently clean the wound edges withmild soap and water. Keep the wound covered anddry as much as possible. For tissue adhesives :Keep the tissue adhesive completely dry until it spontaneously peels off in7-10 days. Do not apply topical antibiotic ointment. Follow-up with your primary care physician in ____ days for suture removal.

After your sutures are removed (or your tissueadhesive falls off), the wound is not completelyhealed. Therefore, treat it gently. Apply sunscreento sun-exposed wounds to prevent increasedpigment uptake and darker scarring as a result ofultraviolet light. Continue this practice for the next6-12 months.Table B.3 Sample patient discharge instructionsprovide clear instructions regarding wound care and all return visits necessary.

They provide a wide spectrumof wound care, including laceration repair. Thischapter addresses wound assessment and modal-ities of laceration repair. Anatomic essentials As the body's largest and the most exposedorgan, the skin is subject to a variety of externalforces encountered in daily activities. The skin's anatomic structure and layers must be con-sidered when planning a repair (Figure C.1). Lacerations penetrating only the epidermis are minor and may not warrant major repair. Theunderlying dermis is one to several millimetersthick depending on its location on the body. Therepair of this layer provides structural integrity for a healing wound. In some cases, especiallywounds under tension, a separate deep dermallayer of closure may be required. The dermisrests on subcutaneous tissue which contains adi- pose and other loose connective tissue. The repairof subcutaneous tissue does not contribute tofinal wound strength. Re-approximation of sub-cutaneous tissue can eliminate potential spaces,thereby decreasing risk of infection in selectedwounds. Wound healing and the final cosmetic outcome of a laceration repair depend on many factors,including dynamic and static tension. Static ten-sion is determined by intrinsic skin factors suchas collagen concentration. Anatomic determinantssuch as underlying bone, tendon, muscle andlocation over a joint space impact the dynamictension of the repaired laceration. Natural linesof tension exist all over the body (Figure C.2).Wounds oriented along these lines are under less stress, and often lead to more favorable cosmeticoutcomes. Lacerations that are oriented perpen-dicular to these lines are under higher tension;therefore, the method selected for closure mayrequire more tensile support. In addition, these latter wounds may leave more noticeable scars. History When did it happen? Time from injury to cleansing and closure affects the ability of the wound to be closed primarilyAppendix C Laceration repair F.C. von Trampe, MD,MPH and Coates, MD Epidermis Dermis Subcutaneous tissue Figure C.1 Cross section of skin with associated structures . (a) (b) Figure C.2 The natural lines of tension are perpendicular to thelongitudinal orientation of the underlying muscles.Wounds occurring along these lines generally have a more favorable cosmetic outcome.Laceration repair 714 Appendicesand its likelihood of becoming infected (Table C.1). Lacerations on the head and face can generally beclosed up to 24 hours after injury, whereas injurieson the hands, feet, and trunk are considered to beat high risk for infection after 12 hours delay.Wounds that occurred more than 24 hours prior to evaluation may be considered for delayed pri-mary closure (Table C.2). What was the mechanism of injury? Crush injuries, puncture wounds, burns, and contaminated wounds (human or animal saliva,feces, soil, organic material) warrant special con-sideration. Some of these wounds should not beconsidered for immediate repair in the ED, whileothers may need prophylactic antibiotics todecrease the chance of infection. In addition, cir-cumstance and mechanism of injury (e.g., woundsustained on broken glass) may suggest the presence of foreign body contamination whichwould warrant imaging and exploration todetect and remove debris. Patients sometimessense the presence of a foreign body, and the clini-cian can often palpate one underneath the skin surface. Acomprehensive history may uncover related conditions which can be more important than thelaceration. For example, syncope leading to aminor forehead laceration obligates an extensivework-up and likely hospital admission, com-pared to a mechanical fall leading to a lacerationin the same area. Wounds to the face shouldarouse suspicion for intimate partner violence(Table C.3). Do you have any allergies to medications? It is important to know medication allergies before giving tetanus prophylaxis, analgesics, wound anesthesia, antibiotics, or using latexproducts. What is your tetanus immunization status? An assessment of tetanus immunization status and subsequent immunization with tetanusimmune globulin (TIG) or tetanus toxoid (mostoften as tetanus and diphtheria, Td) is important.Table C.4 provides guidelines for administering tetanus immunization according to current Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC-P)guidelines.

This information may help guide deci- sions whether to use prophylactic antibiotics, and may predict which patients are prone to impaired wound healing (Table C.3). Physical examination The physical examination should take place in awell-lit area with the patient as comfortable as possible. Assess the wound in relation to thehistory provided by the patient to identify otherpossible injuries (e.g., retained foreign bodies).When focusing on the wound itself, there areseveral important principles to help guide yourexamination. Description of the wound Describe the anatomic location, length, anddepth of the wound. The health of the woundmargins and degree of tension should be noted.The different types of wounds should be consid-ered in the description (Table C.5).Table C.3 Medical history which may impact care of a patient with a wound Table C.4 CDC-P guidelines for tetanus prophylaxis (Summary guide to tetanus prophylaxis in routine wound management, 1991.)

There can be relative tissue hypoxia. Have a low threshold for antibiotics and early wound reevaluation. HIV/AIDS Lower threshold for using appropriate antibiotics in wounds that are high risk for infection. Steroid/immunosuppressant These medications cause prolonged healing time and weaken the use immune system. These patients may need a prolonged period of healing prior to suture removal. These patients are also at high risk for infection. Vascular Bleeding disorder Obtain impeccable hemostasis before closing these wounds. Prolonged bleeding may necessitate hematocrit assessment for anemia. Hematoma can serve as culture medium for wound infection. Peripheral vascular disease Poor peripheral circulation increases predisposition for infection. Carefully assess neurovascular status before repair of extremity injuries. Other Cardiac disease Make sure that the wound resulted from a mechanical and not cardiac etiology. Domestic/child/elder abuse The key is to suspect these situations. Have a low threshold for suspicion and reporting when the story does not match the injury.Distal neurologic integrity Examine for motor andsensory deficits prior to anesthetizing the wound. The remainder of the examination should be performed after the woundhas been anesthetized. Nerves can be partiallylacerated. Sensory information is carried periph-erally in nerve bundles; loss of sensation may bethe only manifestation of a partial nerve injury. Distal vascular integrity Assess and document signs of adequate or inad-equate perfusion using a combination of pulses,capillary fistulas. Ankle brachial (ABIs)can be measured when there is concern for anarterial injury. Signs of poor perfusion should be explained and addressed before lacerationrepair. Determine and document neurovascular status following repair to ensure iatrogenicinjuries did not occur during the repair. Tendon integrity Lacerated tendons are at risk for rupture. Manyspecialists advise tendon repair if there is greaterthan 50% disruption. Extensor tendons of the handand foot can often be repaired by emergencyphysicians. Flexor tendons should be repaired bya trained specialist in the operating room. Thetendon must be examined throughout its entirerange of motion over the involved joint. Tendonlacerations in the position of injury may not bevisible in the position of examination. Joint space involvement Laceration extension into a joint space por-tends morbidity for the patient and may requireoperative washout of the affected joint. Maintaina high suspicion for joint capsule disruption withwounds located over joints, mechanisms sug-gesting deep penetration, debris visualized on X-ray over a joint space, or the presence of a radio-opaque foreign body in the joint space itself (seenon two views of plain film radiography). Thesewounds may need to be assessed by a specialist. Bone involvement Obtain plain film radiography in any lacerationwith exposed bone to assess for the presence of fracture or retained foreign bodies. Corticaldisruption of bone with proximity to a lacerationis classified and treated as an open fracture.These wounds usually require antibiotics to pre-vent osteomyelitis.

Surface cleaning and dressing.whether or not to close the wound primarily (Table C.1), and careful exploration for other foreign bodies in the wound. Imaging modalitiesused to detect foreign bodies include: plain X-rayfilms, xerography, ultrasound (US), computedtomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI should not be chosen if ametallic foreign body is suspected. Devitalized tissue Crush, blast, or high speed missile injuriesimpart large forces to tissues and can causenecrosis of dermal and subcutaneous structures.Necrotic tissue can serve as a nidus for infectionand impede normal tissue healing. Devitalizedtissue should be debrided conservatively to preserve as much viable tissue as possible. Thisplaces the healing wound under less tension, andaffords a cosmetic surgeon the most flexibility ifsubsequent wound revision is necessary. Referral and consultation guidelines When the history and physical examination iscomplete, the provider should determine if sheor he possesses the skill necessary to proceedwith the repair. Adequate wound preparationshould take place prior to the referral, and aclean, dry dressing should be applied. Woundcharacteristics that should be considered for con-sultation and referral are noted in Table C.6. Wound preparation For details see Appendix B.Diagnostic testing Patients with lacerations rarely require an exten-sive diagnostic work-up. Radiologic imaging may be indicated for suspicion of a foreign body,joint space involvement, osteomyelitis, fracture,or underlying injury (e.g., CT of the brain). Inpatients presenting with a laceration as a minorpart of their overall condition (e.g., a multipletrauma victim or patient with syncope), thework-up should focus on the primary event inaddition to repairing the laceration. General treatment principles Methods of wound closure There are multiple methods available for repair once the wound has been adequately assessedand the decision to repair has been made. Themost commonly used method is reapproxima-tion by suturing. Suturing Basic suturing supplies consist of needle drivers, tissue forceps (or skin hook), scissors, steriledrapes, sterile gloves, suture materials (Table C.7),and sterile gauze . Numerous methods of suturing can be used to repair a laceration. Some approaches have specific advantages which may benefit certain lacerationtypes. To begin the suturing process, the needleis attached to the needle driver which is placed inthe palm of the dominant hand. The index fingeris extended along the arms of the closed needledriver. The palm may be used for opening andclosing the needle driver's locking mechanism(Figure C.3). In this position, the needle can berotated along an imaginary axis, and optimal operator ergonomics are possible. An alternatemethod is to place the tips of the thumb and ringdigits into the rings of the handle. The needleshould always enter and exit at 90\u00b0 to the skinsurface for minimal tissue damage. Edge ever-sion is needed for vertical tissue alignment alongdermal layers to optimize wound cosmesis. Simple interrupted The simple interrupted is the most frequently used stitch in wound approximation (Figure C.4). With Appendices 717Laceration repair Table C.6 Wounds appropriate for consultation/referral Primary provider is unable to perform optimal repair -Skill level does not match complexity of wound -Practice setting is too busy to allow adequate time for repair Underlying injury -Tendon -Nerve -Vascular Joint involvement or underlying fracture Eyelid: tarsal plate or lacrimal duct involvement Patient requests specialist Operative repair necessary -Skin grafting -Flap creation or rotationthe needle at a 90\u00b0 angle to the skin surface, the dermis is penetrated. The needle is then driventhrough the opposing side of the laceration withextreme care to meticulously approximate eachlevel of tissue. To secure the stitch, an instrumenttie is generally done using a surgeon's knot (a flatdouble throw) followed by single throws tiedsequentially in opposite directions (Figure C.5). Five knots are needed to secure nylon sutures, while three throws are generally adequate forbraided, soft sutures. Wound edges should begently approximated (not strangulated). Whenthe knot is finished, it should be gently retractedto one side of the wound. This is to keep the knotfrom serving as a nidus of contamination, or fromimpinging on the healing wound tissue, makingan unsightly divot in the final scar (Figure C.6).Suture placement should be symmetric. Cosmet-ically important areas may require a smaller sutureinterval for better appearance. There should be aconsistent relationship between needle entrypoint and suture interval. Horizontal mattress The horizontal mattress suture is used to close a wound under mild to moderate tension. It is anespecially useful alternative to two-layer closurein a patient who is at high risk for developing awound infection. Its proper placement dispersestensile forces over a larger area, providing betterperfusion of healing wound edges (Figure C.8).

Tying the knotas shown in Figure C.9 places the knot at the bot-tom of the laceration and prevents it from disrupt-ing the surface appearance by \"spitting\" throughthe wound site. A superficial layer of closure canthen be applied to re-approximate the epidermis.This can be done with simple interrupted sutures, Appendices 719Laceration repair Figure C.4 Sequence illustrating the placement of a simple interrupted suture.

Placing a deep layer of absorbable sutures can increase the wound infection rate, especially inpatients with dirty wounds (human or animal bites) or underlying medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus or poor circulation. Corner stitch \"V\"-shaped lacerations result in a small apical flap of tissue which can be friable and poorlyperfused. Placing stitches directly through thistissue may cause necrosis and a poor cosmeticoutcome. The half-buried mattress suture canhelp preserve distal perfusion and spreads ten-sion along the distal flap. Care must be taken toassure that the suture is at the same tissue depthin each side of the laceration (Figure C.10). Staples Some wounds have less cosmetic importance, and require rapid closure. As a definitive or temporizing measure, stapling a laceration is an Laceration repair 720 Appendices(a) (b) (c) Figure C.9 Placing intradermal sutures increases the risk of infection in a wound. However, deepsutures can remove \"potential\" spaces where fluid collection may distort tissue anatomyand/or predispose to infection. In addition, deep sutures facilitate closure of woundswhich are widely open at the surface. This sequence demonstrates burying the knot.

Wounds appropriate for staples are linear, without raggededges, and under minimal tension (edges need toalign well without the use of tissue forceps whenworking alone). Although staples are most oftenused for scalp lacerations in the ED, it is impera-tive to remember that most men will have somebalding, and a scar which was initially coveredby hair may become a cosmetic problem with areceding hairline. To place staples, the stapling device is placed at the skin surface, and the sta-ple is brought forward with a smooth motionusing the trigger mechanism (Figure C.11). It isimportant not to indent the skin surface as thismay cause improper vertical alignment of woundedges. Removal of staples in a timely mannerwill improve cosmetic outcome since staples arelarger in diameter than most sutures. Commercialstaple removers should be used to properly (andpainlessly) remove staples. After staple removal,many physicians place tissue adhesive strips toaugment the tensile strength of the closure for anadditional time period. Tissue adhesives Tissue adhesives are recent additions to the armamentarium for laceration repair. Lacerationsappropriate for tissue adhesives are clean, linear, and under little or no tension. Wounds areassessed and prepared in the same way as anyother wound prior to closure (Appendix B).Impeccable hemostasis and dry overlying skinare required for successful closure. Wound edgesare held together with finger tips or a commer-cially-available device as the liquid adhesive isstroked across the tissue defect, taking care toavoid getting adhesive within the wound or onthe application device. Avoid use around theeyes to prevent corneal or lid adhesion. Tissueadhesives are not indicated for use on mucousmembranes. There is no need for a wound dress-ing. The wound should be kept dry; ointment(including antibacterial) should not be used since it may dissolve the adhesive and cause thewound to prematurely dehisce. The use of theseointments can be helpful in removing unin-tended applications of tissue adhesive. In particu-lar,ophthalmic ointments can aid in removing tissue adhesive from the eyes. Routine evalu-ation and treatment for corneal abrasions shouldfollow if this occurs. Tissue adhesives are well tolerated by pedi- atric patients. They provide a painless alternativeto suturing. Some patients experience a warmsensation as the bonding process occurs.

(b) Benzoin is applied as an adjunct for the tapestrips. (c) Tape strips placed in a symmetric fashion to close a wound. Table C.8 Suture removal guidelines Choosing a topical anesthetic with vasoconstrict- ive properties is consistent with the overall reduc-tion of pain in this repair modality. Wound taping (butterfly closure) The wound is assessed and prepared in the usual manner. Wounds appropriate for this techniqueare linear or curvilinear, clean, and under min-imal tension. Pediatric patients tend to pick, soak, or pull at these tape, which may cause a wound to prematurely dehisce. Taping can be used in con-junction with a layer of deep sutures in order tokeep the overlying skin closely approximated. Toplace the tape, wound edges are cleaned andtincture of benzoin adhesive is applied to bothsides of the wound margin (taking care not toplace inside wound). After several seconds of airdrying, adhesive strips ar e placed at appr opriate intervals to approximate the skin edges. One partof a laceration may require more strips thananother part (Figure C.12). Wound adhesive stripsgenerally fall of within a week of application. It isadvisable to prevent these wounds and tapesfrom getting wet. Wound care and patient disposition When a laceration repair is complete, the patient'soverall medical condition should be consideredwhen planning disposition. Wound checks, useof antibiotics or analgesics, and tetanus or rabiesprophylaxis are tailored to the individual patient.Wound care instructions and suture removal guidelines should be given to the patient (andfamily member or friend, if appropriate), bothverbally and in writing (Tables B.3, C.8). The dur-ation of suture placement and wound tension areproportional to increased scarring. However,sutures must remain long enough to allow thehealing process to begin. Cosmetically importantareas, such as the face, should have sutures inplace for a shorter amount of time to reduce scar-ring. Fortunately, these wounds usually heal rap-idly. Scars that are exposed to sunlight shouldhave sunscreen applied for 6 months after injury.Routine use of antibiotics is not necessary formost wounds. Use of antibiotics for contamin-ated lacerations, such as human or animal bites,or in wounds selected for delayed primary clos-ure is recommended. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Routine use of antibiotics is not necessarywhen adequate wound preparation occurs.Antibiotics are indicated in bite wounds andin wounds selected for delayed primaryclosure. They are often used in high-riskwounds in patients at increased risk of infection. W ound edges should be approximated meticulously, with gentle wound edgeeversion. Devitalized tissue should be debridedconservatively. Foreign bodies should be considered prior toclosure. Tissue adhesives are excellent alternatives for repairing clean wounds that are not undertension. Careful attention to proper technique makesa good cosmetic outcome more likely. Thedermis provides the strength necessary forhealing. References 1.Harwood-Nuss A (ed.). The Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine , 3rd ed., Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams &Wilkins, 2001.

Wounds and Lacerations , 2nd ed., the problem Procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) represents one of the great advances in emer- gency medicine's maturation as a specialty. It has become a r outine part of emergency medical practice, encompassing many fundamental clini-cal skills including airway assessment and man-agement and critical resuscitation skills. PSA isvery safe in the hands of a properly-trained prac-titioner in the correct setting with appropriatemonitoring and resuscitation equipment. Older terminology attempted to describe the state of sedation and analgesia in static terms,such as conscious sedation . This definition required that patients given agents providing both sed-ation and analgesia remained conscious, and werestill able to reflexively protect their airways. Theterminology has evolved to reflect the continuumupon which sedation and analgesia occur, rangingfrom anxiolysis deep sedation and general anesthesia. Allof these levels may be applied to the emergencydepartment (ED) setting with the exception ofgeneral anesthesia; this implies a complete loss ofconsciousness and protective airway reflexes. Certain ED procedures and studies commonly require PSA (Table D.1).General treatment principles The major considerations in selecting drugs for PSA include sedation, amnesia, analgesia andmuscle relaxation. The first step is to determinethe desired depth of sedation. A toddler who hassustained a minor head injury and is undergoinga computed tomography (CT) of the head requiresmuch less sedation and essentially no analgesiawhen compared to a child who is having a burndebrided or a long bone fracture reduced. Agents should be selected that provide ade- quate analgesia. Most sedatives provide little, ifany, providesome sedation, the level of sedation only becomesadequate when the patient develops significantrespiratory depression from the amount of anal- gesic given. Duration of the procedure also influ-ences the choice of drug and the route ofdelivery. Individuals respond differently to drugs, even when the dose is calculated according to theirweight. Careful titration produces the optimalresponse. This is best done using intravenous (IV) administration, since repeated oral doses areunpredictable and usually slow to onset, andrepeated intramuscular (IM) injections are not acceptable. Patient assessment and selection If a patient needs a procedure that requires sed-ation and/or analgesia, first determine whetherthe patient is able to tolerate PSA (Table D.2).Candidates for procedural sedation in the EDmust fall into either ASA class I or II. Patients with higher classifications are better served in amore controlled environment, such as the operat- ing room (OR) or intensive care unit (ICU). Next, select a target level of sedation and the duration required. Determine the drug and dosagerange that will most likely produce the desiredAppendix D Procedural sedation and analgesia Eustacia (Jo) Su, MDand Robert L.

The time since the patient's last oral intake is the next risk factor to be considered. Loss of the airway protective reflexes increases the risk ofaspiration of stomach contents. Gastric emptyingtime is variable, even among patients of similarages. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP),American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), and the American Society of Anesthesiol-ogists (ASA ) all have separate guidelines for nulla per os (NPO) times, ranging from 4 to 6hours. Some distinctions are made between NPOtimes depending on whether the food consumedwas solid, full liquid or clear liquid, with solid food consumption pushing NPO times toward the 6-hour mark. These distinctions may varybetween institutions. It is important to remem-ber, however, that preservation of life or limbtakes precedence over NPO status. NPO status for young children and toddlers is slightly morecomplex (Table D.3). Apre-sedation history and physical examin- ation, beyond a general medical screening exami-nation, should focus on issues pertaining directlyto the sedation procedure. The history shouldelicit factors that might increase the direct risks ofmedications and symptoms that suggest underly-ing upper respiratory tract illness or abnormality(i.e., asthma exacerbation or viral syndrome).Patients must also be asked about allergies, pastexperiences with sedation or general anesthesia,and time of last food or liquid intake. The physical examination should focus on baseline vital signs, the oral cavity and the cardiorespiratory system, in particular, notingany potential impediments to endotracheal intubation and ventilation (see Chapter 2).Underlying reactive airway disease or upper res-piratory tract infection should be ruled out witha careful examination of the pulmonary system.If the patient has an upper respiratory tract infec-tion, a higher risk of developing laryngospasmoccurs with some PSA agents. Evaluate the heartfor the presence of murmurs or dysrhythmias. Drug selection Consider the following variables when choosingthe PSA agents for a particular patient and proced-ure: patient comfort, how still the patient has toremain, degree of procedural invasiveness, degree of muscle relaxation, amount of pain, and durationof procedure. The ideal drug for PSA would havepredictable dosing, instantaneous onset, easilyadjustable duration of action, short recovery time,and both amnestic and analgesic properties. Itwould also have minimal hemodynamic effects,no respiratory depression, and would preserveprotective airway reflexes (Table D.4). The combination of a zolam or valium) and a narcotic (morphine orfentanyl) has been, and continues to be, a main-stay of procedural sedation. The combination ofthese agents has been applied widely acrossmany procedures performed in emergency medical practice. Important side effects include respiratory depression and hypotension. The recovery time for the combination of midazolam and fentanyl is generally longer than that for ket-amine, propofol or etomidate. Table D.5 providesa list of reversal agents should they be needed.Table D.2 American Society of Anesthesiologists' classifications for risk stratification Class Patient status I Normally healthy patient.

Theseshould be reviewed carefully before attemptingPSA. Obtain informed consent and discuss risksand benefits of PSA with every patient beforeproceeding. Almost all of the agents used for PSA dimin- ish respiratory drive. All of them produce vary-ing degrees of loss of airway protective reflexes.Any combination of sedative and analgesic drugswill result in at least additive, if not synergistic,depression of both respiratory drive and airwayprotective reflexes. Prepare for apnea and hemodynamic collapse ahead of time (Table D.6). Move the crash cart tothe bedside in preparation for possible respir-atory or cardiac arrest. Place the patient on cardiacand pulse oximetry monitors. Place towels or pil- lows nearby to help keep the patient's airway open during the procedure. Assign a provider towatch the patient, espe cially the respiratory fre- quency and depth. End-tidal capnography, ifavailable, is a very useful adjunct, but is not asubstitute for human vigilance. Closely monitorall vitals signs at least every 5 minutes during thesedation period, more frequently if mandated byhospital policy or the procedure. Ensure that oxygen is immediately available, both by nasal cannula and bag-valve-mask. Mostpractitioners prefer to administer oxygen to thepatient before starting and throughout PSA, tominimize the likelihood and duration of hypoxia.Pre-oxygenation may delay the recognition ofhypoventilation when pulse oximetry is used asthe mainstay of monitoring. It is even moreimportant to closely watch the patient's respir-ations if oxygen is already being administered. Assemble the intubation equipment so that it is close at hand and ready for use. Turn on thesuction and attach the appropriate tip to the tub-ing. Ensure that the suction apparatus is workingproperly prior to giving sedative or analgesicmedications. Select the appropriate endotrachealtube sizes, stylet and laryngoscope blades, makingsure that the handle and blades are functional. Itis not necessary to open all the packaging, butyou should be ready to do so quickly if the needarises. If an IV is not already in place, assemble the necessary equipment so that one can be startedquickly. If you are using drugs with known anti-dotes, make sure that these medications are at thebedside, ready to be drawn up. Post the calcu-lated doses and volumes at the bedside, makingsure that the team can easily see this information. After completing all the preparations outlined above, document the pre-sedation history andphysical examination, the PARQ (procedure,alternatives, risks and questions) discussion, andpatient consent. Assemble the team, assigningone person to closely watch the patient's chestmovement, skin color and level of sedationthroughout the duration of the procedure anduntil the patient has fully recovered. Recovery and discharge The greatest risk of apnea or hypoxia is usuallyafter the painful procedure is over but before thedrugs have worn off. Do not leave a drowsypatient unattended. It is critical that a skilledhealth care provider continues to closely monitorthe patient until adequate recovery from PSA hasoccurred (i.e., the patient is breathing normally,protecting his or her airway, and has returned tobaseline cognitive and motor function). If an anti-dote (i.e., reversal agent) was used, continue toclosely monitor the patient for at least anotherhour beyond the time the antidote was expectedto wear off. This will ensure prompt identificationof any potential recurrence of respiratory depres-sion or sedation from the PSA agents. Discuss discharge criteria with the patient and family/friends who will drive the patienthome. Do not allow the patient to drive. Instructthe patient that subtle cognitive deficits and Procedural sedation and analgesia 730 AppendicesPre-procedure checklist High-flow oxygen* and blood pressure Crash cart* Reversal agents (specific for procedural sedationand analgesia agents used)* Adequate staff for monitoring and documentation* consent* *Suggested minimum equipment.Table D.6 Advance preparation for PSAdrowsiness may persist hours after PSA, and therefore s/he should neither drive nor operateheavy machinery for at least 24 hours after PSA.Patients and family or friends should fully under-stand instructions regarding the signs and symp-toms which mandate immediate return to the ED. Patients are considered safe for discharge when they are able to fulfill specific dischargecriteria (Table D.7). All patients must have a full understanding of late side effects that may occur as a result of theirsedation. Vomiting may occur after discharge fol-lowing the use of ketamine or narcotic anal-gesics. In rare cases, post-sedation hallucinationsmay occur with ketamine for a period of severalweeks. Special patients Infants and toddlers have the most variableresponse to medications. Medications should be dosed according to a current and accurately meas-ured weight whenever possible. Before startingPSA, select the appropriately-sized airway equip-ment and have it within easy reach at the bedside. Patients on psychotropic medications may react unpredictably to some analgesics and sedatives,particularly ketamine. The elderly often have diminished cardiores- piratory reserve and are often taking several medi-cations which might interact with PSA agents. These patients require very careful, slow titrationof medications and hypervigilance in monitoringtheir oxygenation and ventilation status.IV drug users usually have a high tolerance to opiate analgesia, but not necessarily to the respiratory depression induced by the opiates. These patients require extra precaution. The potentially hypovolemic patient should be optimally fluid resuscitated prior to giving seda-tive-analgesics in order to prevent hemodynamiccompromise or even cardiovascular collapse. Pearls, pitfalls, and myths Prior planning and careful preparation for the worst possible scenarios are thehallmarks of safe PSA. Begin with carefulpatient selection, proper monitoringprocedures, availability of advanced airwaymanagement equipment, and close post-procedure and recovery observation. Pulse oximetry and capnography areessential for adequate monitoring but do notreplace human vigilance. Assign a care provider to constantly monitor the patient'schest movement, color and mental status. Supplemental oxygen in a sedated,hypoventilating patient may improveoxygenation but will not improve ventilatorystatus. Manual stimulation and airwayrepositioning should be the first measures used to address decreasing oxygen saturationor increasing carbon dioxide levels.

TheFAST exam has gained wide acceptance in the United States in the past decade. No other imag-ing modality has the ability to diagnose criticaltraumatic conditions as quickly or as accuratelyas bedside US. Ultrasonographic techniques arenoninvasive, do not expose patients to radiation,and are performed with relatively inexpensiveportable equipment. In the initial assessment oftrauma patients, abdominal US is now replacingdiagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL), and echocar-diography has replaced invasive subxiphoidpericardiotomy. With increasing numbers ofemergency medicine residency programs incor-porating formal US training into their curricu-lum, its role in emergency medicine practice isbeing further solidified. Equipment Essential components of US equipment are acces-sibility, portability, reliability and ease of use. Most trauma centers now have po rtable machines on site ready to be wheeled to the bedside at amoments notice. While most machines come witha variety of transducers, the most commonly-used transducer for the FAST examination is mainadvantage of the microconvex transducer thatthe footprint can easily fit between the ribs whenevaluating the upper quadrants and the heart.The need to rapidly evaluate and expedite care oftrauma patients makes using different transducersfor each view burdensome and inefficient. Sinceexaminations should be recorded, printing,videotaping or digital storage capability is alsonecessary.Ideal machine characteristics Cost: relatively low ($20,000-40,000). Portability : small, lightweight, easily movable. Durability : enclosed probe holders, flat \"spill-proof\" keyboard. Image quality : clear and sharp, with good resolution. Probe selection : electronic, multi-frequency, small \"footprint.\" Output : thermal paper, videotape, digital storage, network capability. Service : on-site maintenance contract. Procedure FAST consists of multiple, focused ultrasono- graphic views of the abdomen and the peri-cardium. The primary objective of the FASTexamination is to detect free intraperitoneal fluid.Used in this fashion, FAST has replaced DPL.Ultrasonographic evidence of hemoperitoneumstrongly indicates that therapeutic laparotomy isrequired, whereas a \"positive\" DPL often does not. FAST is a useful screening test for hemoperi-toneum despite its low specificity for injury loca-tion. Intestinal fluid and intraperitoneal urinecan also produce positive FAST results, but likehemoperitoneum, both require surgical interven-tion. Ascites can confound the diagnosis but canbe differentiated from hemoperitoneum by needleparacentesis. It is important to recognize that USwill not reliably detect solid organ injury withouthemoperitoneum; thus, high-risk stable patientsshould proceed to computed tomography (CT). Clinical indications for the exam 1.Blunt trauma. 2.Penetrating thoracic/abdominal trauma. 3.Unexplained hypotension in trauma. 4.Evaluation of the pregnant trauma patient. The use of multiple views greatly increases thesensitivity of the FAST examination in the detec- tion with sonography in traumaFocused assessment with sonography in trauma 734 Appendicesviews have low sensitivity and have been elimi- nated from most protocols. Figure E.1 illustrates the basic views of the FAST examination. The important areas to be imaged are the following: 1.Morison's pouch : This area is the initial view for US evaluation of blunt trauma. As the landmarks are easy to find, this view isobtained within 10 seconds with the probeplaced in the mid-posterior axillary line justbelow the nipple level at the 11th-12thintercostal space. The liver is seen as a solidhomogeneous organ, with the kidneyadjacent to it. The space between theseorgans, Morison's pouch , is a potential space that can fill with fluid (Figure E.2). Free fluidin this area appears as an anechoic (black)stripe (Figures E.3 and E.4). The amount offree fluid that may occupy Morison's pouchvaries, but as little as 250 ml can be detected.Hyperechoic (white or gray) areas thatsurround the kidney represent normalperinephric fat and should not be confusedwith free fluid. In patients with smalleramounts of hemoperitoneum, placing thepatient in reverse Trendelenburg can improve imaging sensitivity by making theupper quadrants of the abdomen moredependent. Following the examination of SuprapubicSubcostalMorison's pouchPerisplenic Figure E.1 Schematic of probe placement for the examination(FAST: focused assessment with sonography in trauma).Courtesy :William Mallon, probe more cephalad and examine the diaphragm to lookfor fluid above or below it. Pleural fluid willappear anechoic or black above thediaphragm (Figure E.5). With practice,hemothoraces can be reliably detected. 2.Perisplenic view : To obtain this view, place the probe at the posterior axillary line at the9th-11th intercostal space. A commonmistake is not placing the probe posteriorlyenough. Once the kidney is located, angle theprobe slightly cephalad to visualize thespleen. Look carefully for free fluidsurrounding it (Figures E.6 and E.7). Once the spleen and kidney are fully scanned, anglethe probe more cephalad to scan above andbelow the diaphragm, looking for fluid. 3.Suprapubic view : Ideally, this examination is conducted before the placement of a Foleycatheter, as the full bladder provides anacoustic window for small amounts of freefluid posterior to the bladder. It is easilyvisualized with the probe positioned justcephalad to the pubis. The bladder isidentified as a fluid collection that appears asa well-circumscribed anechoic area (FigureE.8). Having identified the bladder, look forfree fluid anterior, posterior, and lateral to it(Figure E.9). In female patients, the uterus isseen posterior to the bladder. Therectouterine pouch (Pouch of Douglas) is a very dependent area of the peritoneal cavityand should be examined carefully for smallamounts of free fluid. 4.Pericardium : It is especially important to evaluate the pericardium in patients withpenetrating thoracic injuries, as it may harbor asymptomatic pericardial effusions.For this view, place the probe in the subcostalarea just below the xiphisternum and angle ittoward the patient's left shoulder. To viewthe heart adequately, increase the depth ofultrasonographic penetration in this view. Acoronal section of the heart usually provides the examiner with a good four-chamber view of the heart (Figure E.10). Thenormal pericardium is seen as a hyperechoic(white) line intimately surrounding the heart. Figure E.5 Right pleural effusion seen as an (arrow) (L: liver). Figure E.7Positive perisplenic view with free fluid between the spleen and diaphragm (arrow) (S: spleen). effusion is identified as an anechoic area surrounding the heart within the pericardium (Figure E.11). Obtain asagittal view for confirmation, sincepulmonary effusions can be confused withpericardial effusions on this view. Forpatients with wounds in proximity to theheart, the FAST examination should beginwith the pericardial view (focusedechocardiography) to detect effusion resultingfrom a cardiac injury.Summary Asummary of the FAST examination is given in Table E.1. Limitations and pitfalls To obtain the greatest clinical benefit from bedside US, the clinician must understand its technicallimitations. The sensitivity of US in detecting freefluid varies between 80% and 98%; patient posi-tioning can improve sensitivity. In addition, US isa real-time modality in which examination find-ings can change in a matter of minutes. Performserial examinations in high-risk cases, when thereis a change in vital signs or drop in hematocrit.

Thus,abdominal CT should be obtained in high-riskcases. In addition, US examination of extremelyobese patients and patients with extensive subcu-taneous emphysema is difficult. For such patients,a combination of procedures such as CT, DPL, andeven pericardiotomy may be necessary to detectserious internal injury (Table E.2).References 1.Jones RA, Welch RD.

Emer-gency physicians are often faced with manypatient presentations and a multitude of possiblelaboratory tests to aid diagnosis and treatment.Understanding the strengths and limitations ofeach individual test is crucial in applying the testin its correct clinical context. The emergencyphysician must make rational decisions abouteach laboratory test ordered and base each testordered on the patient's clinical presentation.Using laboratory data in a \"shotgun\" mentalityto hopefully \"discover\" a diagnosis often leads toinappropriate testing, unnecessary procedures,delays in care, and potential harm. This chapterwill focus on interpretation of laboratory data thatis routinely used in the emergency department(ED). It should be noted that normal reference val-ues provided may vary between individual insti-tutions, gender, and with age. It is recommendedto refer to your institution's reference values.

Absolute lymphocyte count calcu- lated using the formula: ALC /H11005WBC /H11003(lymphocyte percentage) The ALC can be used as a surrogate marker for the CD 4 count. Those patients with an ALC less than 1000 cells/mm3are at higher risk for oppor- tunistic infections. Abnormalities and causes 1.Elevated WBC : May be elevated in an acute infection, as well as stress, steroid use, and inflammatory states. Other causes includeprolonged crying in infants, pain, vomiting,dysrhythmias, pregnancy, neoplasm,exercise, acute myocardial infarction (AMI),surgery, and seizures. Look for a \"left shift\"which indicates the presence of immatureforms in the peripheral circulation (bands).This usually represents an infectious state. 2.Decreased WBC : May be decreased with infection, septicemia, viral illness, andimmunocompromised states. Neutropenia,defined as ANC /H110211800 cells/mm 3, places the patient at risk of infections from commonand opportunistic organisms. 3.Decreased HCT : May be secondary to acute blood loss, hemolysis, or long-standinganemia. If suspecting acute loss, look forschistocytes on the peripheral blood smear.Pregnancy can also lower the HCT by 10%.Long-standing anemia can be evaluated bythe RBC indices. Expect the HCT to dropfrom administration of fluids in hypovolemicshock or trauma resuscitation. 4.Increased HCT : An elevated HCT be hemoconcentrated states, high altitude,exercise, polycythemia or chronicobstructive platelet count : Thrombocytosis occurs when platelet counts are in excess of 1 million. Usually large and nonfunctioning,this condition is seen in myeloproliferativedisorders or secondary to iron deficiencyanemia, splenectomized states, chronicinflammatory disorders, or hemolytic anemia. 6.Decreased platelet count : Thrombocytopenia occurs when platelet counts are less than thenormal range. It may be caused by bonemarrow injury from drugs or chemicals,radiation, or infection. It can also be seen inbone marrow failure due to carcinoma,leukemia, lymphoma, or fibrosis. Other causesinclude menses, or poor nutritional states suchas iron, folate, and vitamin B 12 deficiencies. Pearls and pitfalls 1.Patients with serious infections may havecompletely normal or low WBC counts.Overreliance on normal WBC counts in thesetting of acute infections may lead tomisdiagnosis and delays in patient care. 2.Toxic granulations, Dohle bodies, and cytoplasmic vacuolization are remnants ofphagocytosis found in neutrophils. These areindicative of more serious bacterial infections. 3.Acute hemorrhage will not be reflected in theHgb or HCT early on. 4.Geriatric patients will more than likelydemonstrate normal to low WBC counts in sepsis. Serum chemistries Serum chemistries, also serum elec-trolytes, include potassium, c hloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creati-nine, and glucose. Indications 1.Evaluation of life-threatening hyper- or hypokalemic 2.Evaluation of mental changes, new-onset seizure. 3.Evaluation of renal function, chronichypertension, or diuretic of hyper- or and volume ifpoor oral intake, repeated vomiting,significant diarrhea, muscle weakness, oralcohol abuse. 7.Evaluation of hyperosmolar states. 8.Evaluation of upper causes 1.Elevated sodium : Hypernatremia is seen in hyperosmolar states, severe dehydration, and diabetes insipidus. 2.Decreased sodium : Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte inhospitalized to hyperglycemia,hyperlipidemia, and hyperproteinemia. 3.Elevated potassium : Hyperkalemia is often the result of specimen hemolysis. Truecauses of hyperkalemia include acidosis,tissue potassium. 4.Decreased potassium : Hypokalemia is often from vomiting, diarrhea, diuretics, renal tubular acidosis,renal failure). Bicarbonate decreases by an average of 15% during pregnancy. May alsolower by 5-8 mEq/L due to hyperventilation. 9.Increased BUN : Dehydration, high protein intake, exercise, renal failure, uppergastrointestinal bleeding, or CHF. 10.Decreased BUN : Low protein intake, high water intake, cirrhosis, or pregnancy.11.Increased creatinine : Renal insufficiency, renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, dehydration, orstrenuous exercise. 12.Decreased creatinine : Pregnancy, malnutrition, or water intoxication. 13.Hyperglycemia : Diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, Cushing's disease,pheochromocytoma, acute illness,glucocorticoid use, lithium, or : especially insulin, sulfonylureas, ethanol, insulinoma, starvation, adrenalinsufficiency, growth hormone deficiency,renal failure, hypopituitarism, postprandial, after gastric surgery, or factitious(insulin/sulfonylurea misuse). Pearls and pitfalls 1.Hyperglycemia causes pseudohyponatremia: sodium corrected /H11005sodium /H11001glucose /H110025 3.5 General rule of thumb: for every 100 mg/dLincrease in plasma glucose concentration,the plasma sodium concentration decreasesby approximately 1.6 meq/L. 2.Most often hypo- or hypernatremia can becorrected by underlyingcondition or by administration of normalsaline; 3% saline is rarely needed and mustbe given very slowly to avoid central pontine myelinosis. Be sure to monitor urine output and check electrolytes frequently. Goalshould be to correct the sodium gradually(maximum rate of 0.5 mEq/L/hour). 3.Serum potassium below 3 mEq/L indicatesa total body deficit of 300-400 mEq of totalbody potassium. Each 10 mEq of potassiumreplaced will raise the serum potassium by roughly 0.1 mEq/L. 4.Hyperkalemia is often reflected in theelectrocardiogram (ECG) with peaked T waves, followed by loss of the P wave,widening of the QRS complex, and sine wave-appearing tachycardia. of weakness,paralysis, paresthesias, or tetany. Treatmentincludes close cardiovascular monitoring,immediate antagonism at thecardiac membrane with calcium chloride orcalcium gluconate, lowering the serumpotassium, and correcting the underlyingcause. Serum potassium can be lowered byadministration of sodium bicarbonate, glucose and insulin, and nebulized beta-agonists. Definitive treatment to removeexcess potassium from the body oral/rectal exchange resins(i.e., equation: An osmolal gap indicates the presence ofmillimolar amounts of an unchargedparticle. If the osmolal gap is elevated, thepatient's serum ethanol level should bemeasured. If the gap is greater than 10, thenunaccounted osmols thepresence of a metabolic acidosis.\"MUDPILECATS\" is helpful mnemonicfor anion acidosis: 7.Patients with severe acidosis tend to haveelevated potassium levels. Even when apatient's total body potassium is severelydepleted, the serum potassium will be highin acidotic states. This is commonly seen inDKA. As the patient is treated, serumpotassium levels may fall precipitously if notclosely monitored and corrected. Rememberto correct the patient's potassium only afterurine output has been established. 8.Use clinical judgment before ordering serumchemistries. Avoid using chemistry panelsas screening tools. 9.Determining blood glucose is critical in theevaluation of any patient with mental statuschanges, stroke-like symptoms, coma, drugingestion, or acute illness. If hypoglycemiais suspected, treat first with 1 amp of D 50 prior to any delay in obtaining formallaboratory values. Bedside glucosedetermination using glucometers is verycommon and recommended as long as itdoes not cause significant delay inadministering glucose. 10.Bedside glucometers are often inaccurate inpatients with a low PO 2or HCT, and are affected by an inadequate amount of blood,improper storage reagents, and machinecalibration. Other chemistries Calcium Indications 1.Altered mental status. 2.Recent thyroid and parathyroid surgery, neck trauma, or neck surgery. 3.Multiple myeloma, bone metastases. 4.New-onset renal (pancreatectomy,small bowel resection) not allowingabsorption of calcium from the small intestine. Pearls and pitfalls 1.Hypocalcemia primarily causesneuromuscular (tetany, seizures, musclecramps, weakness) and cardiovascular 2.Calcium levels are include:-Chvostek sign : Tap over the facial nerve 2cm anterior to the tragus of the ear. Twitching of the mouth, nose, eye, and facial muscles will occur. -Trousseau sign : Inflation of a blood pressure cuff above the systolic pressure causeslocal ulnar and median nerve ischemia,resulting in carpal spasm. Not recommended to perform this test; it is usually noted incidentally during vital signmeasurement at triage. Magnesium Indications 1.Evaluation Dehydration, hemoconcentration, hypoglycemia, hemolyzed specimen, cell lysis syndromes,hemolytic anemia, renal failure, or DKA. 2.Decreased magnesium : Malabsorption, malnutrition, renal tubular injury,hypoparathyroidism, ethanol use, digoxinuse, cyclosporines, or cisplatin use. Pearls and pitfalls 1.Magnesium infusion is first-line treatment in torsades de pointes, ecclamptic seizures;some use in severe asthma exacerbation(impending respiratory failure). 2.Magnesium should be infused slowly, toavoid complications such as a loss of reflexes,muscle weakness, hypotension, vasodilation,respiratory failure. Liver function tests Liver wasformerly known by SGOT; ALT by SGPT. Indications 1.Evaluation of the synthetic, excretory, and metabolic function of the liver and biliary tract. 2.Evaluation of liver damage from toxicsubstances, drugs, autoimmune disorders,infectious processes, ecclampsia. Normal values AST and causes 1.Elevated AST : Liver injury (acute and chronic hepatitis), obstructive jaundice, AMI(however seldom used due to its lack ofspecificity), skeletal muscle diseases,hemolytic anemia, gallstone pancreatitis,drug-induced liver or muscle injury. 2.Decreased AST or ALT : Pregnancy (both mg/dL) or chronic renal failure. 3.Elevated ALT : Hepatocellular injury, large myocardial damage, skeletal muscle disease,gallstone pancreatitis, or drugs inducingliver or injury. 4.Elevated Obstructive jaundice, hepatitis, cirrhosis, metastatic liver disease, pancreatitis,prostate cancer, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes.Used by some as a general screen for liverdisease. Elevated in approximately 70% ofalcoholic liver disease. 5.Decreased GGT Exercise, pregnancy, Appendices 743Interpretation of emergency laboratories6.Elevated ALK : liver lesions, primary biliary cirrhosis, drug-induced hepatitis, metastaticbone cancer, that lead toincreased bone turnover (osteomalacia,Paget's disease, osteosarcoma), orhyperthyroidism. Mainly used to detect andmonitor liver or bone disease. 7.Decreased ALK : Pregnancy or blood transfusions. 8.Elevated bilirubin : Liver or biliary tract diseases, or neonatal hyperbilirubinemia(may storage. LDH : Hemolytic anemia, malignancies, acute hepatitis, MI, shock,strangulated bowel obstruction, amiodarone(chronic use), or hemolyzed specimens.Nonspecific marker of cell injury, seen withmost types of cell damage. Pearls and pitfalls 1.With most types of acute hepatitis, ALT is elevated to a higher degree than AST. Veryhigh values occur with ischemic and toxichepatitis. With muscle injury, AST is usually3-5 times higher than ALT. 2.With alcoholic hepatitis, the AST: ALT ratio is about 3 : 1 because alcohol damages themitochondria, a source of AST. With viralhepatitis, the ALT is usually greater than theAST because toxicity is more liver-specific. 3.During the course of common bile ductobstruction, the AST and ALT will be the firstto rise, followed by the ALK and bilirubin. 4.The indirect bilirubin (unconjugated) can bemeasured by subtracting the direct bilirubin(conjugated) from the measured total bilirubin. Amylase Indications Used in the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Normal values Amylase 60-110 IU/L cysts. It is also seen in ectopicpregnancy; however, it is not used as ascreening test due to its lack of specificity. 2.Decreased amylase : Chronic pancreatitis, hypertriglyceridemia, pancreaticinsufficiency, or malnutrition. Pearls pitfalls 1.May remain elevated in acute pancreatitis foronly 36-48 hours after onset. Less specificthan lipase in the diagnosis of pancreatitis. 2.May be normal in patients with chronicpancreatitis (\"burnt-out\" pancreas). Lipase Indications Used to diagnose pancreatitis. causing pancreatic injury. 2.Decreased lipase : Hepatitis, falsely lowered in obstructive jaundice, pancreatic insufficiency. Pearls and pitfalls 1.Testing for lipase is the most sensitive test for evaluating pancreatic injury. Will remainelevated for up to 7 days following pancreatic injury. Elevations of more than 3 timesnormal markedly increase the likelihood ofpancreatitis. Cardiac markers Cardiac (CK-MB), troponin, with suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Myoglobin,present in all muscle tissue, is generally Interpretation of emergency laboratories 744 Appendiceselevated within 2 hours of symptom onset. It is limited by its lack of specificity.Combining ECG interpretation withmyoglobin within the first 4 hours ofsymptom onset has the best sensitivity forAMI. Between 4 and 12 hours of symptomonset, ECG, myoglobin, and CK-MB are thebest predictors of AMI. Troponin levels havean advantage in that they remain elevatedlonger than CK-MB enzymes. is a muscle enzyme found in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain tissue. It can be elevated after strenuousexercise, muscle damage, AMI,hypothyroidism, malignant hyperthermia,neuroleptic malignant syndrome, orintramuscular injection. 2.Decreased CK : infarction, myocarditis, not relativeindex). 4.Troponins : Troponins are small enzymes found in muscle tissue. Two of these enzymes(troponin-I and troponin-T) are found only in cardiac tissue. Troponin-I and Troponin-Tmay be elevated in myocardial infarction,unstable angina, and failure. myoglobin : Skeletal muscle injury, myocardial infarction, renal failure,seizures, or exercise. Pearls and pitfalls 1.Myoglobin rises earliest with muscle injury(within 2-4 hours), peaks in 8-12 hours, and returns to normal within 24-40 hours. Lacks cardiospecificity since it is abundant in allmuscle tissue. 2.CK-MB is first detected by 3-4 hours in theblood, peaks by 12 hours and returns tonormal within 24-36 hours. With myocardialdamage, CK-MB is greater of thetotal CK released. Values between 3% and10% are indeterminate. A relative index isused to help by dividing CK-MB by total CKand multiplying by 100. A ratio less than 3 isindicative of skeletal muscle; a ratio greaterthan 5 indicates cardiac muscle injury. 3.Troponins rise in the blood 3-4 hours after injury and remain elevated for up to 10 days.Apositive troponin in the setting of unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevationmyocardial infarction is associated with afour times greater risk of death than patientswithout positive troponin values. 4.Normal cardiac markers within the first fewhours after symptom onset does not rule outACS and should not be used as a basis fordischarging a patient. B-type natriuretic Intermediate: pg/ml Elevated: greater than 400 pg/ml Abnormalities and causes1.ABNP level less than 100 pg/ml is highly accurate in excluding CHF as the cause of dyspnea. Increased levels need to beinterpreted in the context of a patient'sclinical status, as not every patient with an increased BNP level has decompen-sated CHF. Pearls and pitfalls 1.The diagnosis of CHF can often be made onclinical and radiographic grounds, and aBNP level does not aid in diagnosticaccuracy. 2.Intermediate levels may prove helpful inprognosis if a patient's level emergency laboratoriesPT, PTT, INR Definitions 1.Prothrombin time (PT) : Measure of the extrinsic (factor VII) and common (factor II, V, X) pathways, as well as coumadin monitoring. 2.Activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) : Measure of the intrinsic (factors XI, IX, VIII)and common (factors II, V , X) pathways. 3.International normalized ratio (INR):Calculation based on a correction factor froma patient's and control's PT to normalize thePT, therefore facilitating accurate comparisonamong different laboratories. Normal values PT: 9-15 seconds PTT: 22-33 seconds INR: Coumadin effective between 2 and 3 with low risk of bleeding. Indications for obtaining PT1.Warfarin (coumadin) therapy. 2.Suspected coagulopathy (disseminated without obvious source. 4.Clinical evidence of liver disease. 5.History of abnormal, excessive, orspontaneous bleeding. 6.History of coagulopathy. 7.Before surgery or major vascular procedure ifliver disease, malnutrition, or malabsorptionexists or clinical history is not available. 8.Known or suspected warfarin overdose orexcessive coagulopathy (DIC, hemophilia). 3.Active bleeding with or without obvious cause. 4.Clinical evidence of liver disease. 5.History of abnormal, excessive, orspontaneous bleeding. 6.History of coagulopathy. 7.Before surgery or major vascular procedure if liver disease, malnutrition, or malabsorp-tion exists or clinical history is not available.Abnormalities and causes 1.Elevated (prolonged) PT : Coumadin therapy, liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, antiphospholipid antibodies, congenitalfactor VII deficiencies, or antibiotics. 2.Elevated (prolonged) PTT : Heparin therapy, thrombolytic agents, drugs interfering withvitamin K, hemophilia A and B, DIC,moderate to severe Von Willebrand's disease,liver failure, antiphospholipid antibodies, orincompletely filled lab tubes. 3.Decreased PTT : Pregnancy, hemolysis, exercise, or anemia. Pearls and pitfalls 1.Most common causes of prolonged PT andPTT include anticoagulant therapy, vitamin K deficiency (nutritional or secondary to broad-spectrum antibiotics and depletion of bowel flora), liver disease, and DIC. 2.Bleeding from excessive warfarin can bemanaged with 4-5 units of fresh frozenplasma for a short period. Vitamin K(5-10 mg) given orally, SQ or IV partiallyreverses the effect of warfarin. 3.Falsely elevated PTT times is seen if the plasma is excessively turbid or icteric. 4.APT is notindicated before routine hospital admission, heparin therapy, routinepreoperative testing, minor trauma, prior toinitiation of heparin therapy if other co-morbid problems are ruled out, before low-dose subcutaneous heparin therapy, historyof alcohol abuse without clinical disease or coagulopathy. 5.APTT is notindicated in warfarin use, routine hospital admission, routine preoperative testing, minor trauma, beforeinitiation of heparin therapy, low-dosesubcutaneous heparin therapy, history ofalcohol abuse without clinical evidence ofliver disease or coagulopathy. D-dimer (ELISA) Indications 1.Evaluation thromboembolic disease. 2.Detecting fragments of cross-linked fibrin,mainly in DIC. Interpretation of emergency laboratories 746 AppendicesAppendices 747Interpretation of emergency laboratoriesNormal values DIC,pregnancy, or chronic inflammatoryconditions. Pearls and pitfalls 1.Apatient with a negative D-dimer and a low pretest probability for PE is unlikely to havea significant PE. Arterial blood gas Arterial blood gas (ABG) includes blood pH,PCO 2, PO 2, bicarbonate. Indications 1.Evaluation of respiratory and metabolic acid-base disturbances including poisonings,respiratory failure, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)exacerbations. 2.Undifferentiated shock. 3.Unexplained coma orconfusion/obtundation. Normal values Blood pH 3/H1100222-26 causes1.Elevated pH volume contraction, hyperaldosteronism, early CHF, drugs causing alkalosis, or anxiety. 2.Decreased pH : Ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, renal failure, respiratory failure, chronic obstructive lung disease, drugs causingacidosis (isoniazid, iron, salicylates), orethylene metabolicacidosis, hyperthyroidism, PE, or aspirin. 5.Increased PO 2: Oxygen therapy, excessive air bubbles in specimen, hyperventilation, oraspirin. 6.Decreased PO 2: carbonicanhydrase inhibitors, ethylene glycol,methanol, aspirin, or pregnancy. Pearls and pitfalls 1.Prior to obtaining the sample, a patient mustbe evaluated for both radial and ulnararterial blood supply. The Allen's test determines the presence of collateral flowfrom both the radial and ulnar artery in thehand. If abnormal, radial artery cannulationshould be avoided to prevent possibleischemic injuries. 2.ABG specimens must be handledappropriately and run expeditiously. Errorsarise from excess air bubbles in the sample,excess heparin in the syringe, and notimmediately placing the sample on ice. 3.If a patient is hypoxemic, attempt todetermine the etiology. Do not just treat withsupplemental oxygen. 4.The ABG measurement in a patient withcarbon monoxide poisoning will help byidentifying the presence of a metabolicacidosis with a normal PO 2. 5.ABG samples are not necessary if pulseoximetry is sufficient to guide management. Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient The alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient can be used to differentiate between hypoxia causedby hypoventilation alone (i.e., neuromusculardiseases, overdoses) in which and ventilation-perfusionmismatch, which A-a gradient is abnormal. The A-a gradient is calcu-lated using the formula: For an ABG drawn on r oom air at sea level, a more workable formula is: The A-a gradient is increased in smokers and patients with intrinsic lung disease. The A-a gradient increases as people age; a simple for-mula to take this variation into account is: normal A-a gradient /H11021age 4/H110014 Pearls and pitfalls 1.The A-a gradient cannot be determined accurately in a patient who is receiving O 2by nasal cannula, as the FiO 2of the supplemental oxygen must be estimated. 2.Calculating the A-a gradient has clinicalimplications in that hypoxia in the presenceof a normal gradient is treated by improvingventilation, whereas an increased A-agradient should be treated withsupplemental oxygen. 3.The A-a gradient is neither sensitive norspecific for the diagnosis of PE. A normal A-agradient in a young, otherwise healthypatient does not exclude the diagnosis. Urinalysis Urinalysis includes specific casts, granular 5.Evaluation of acute renal failure and acutetubular necrosis. 6.Evaluation of DKA and ketonuria. Normal values Urine : Normally urine is sterile and transparent, with a specific gravity of 1.010 and normal pH. Urine is yellow due to urochrome pigment, withthe degree of coloration related to urine concen-tration. Cloudiness indicates the presence of par-ticulate matter such as crystals, RBCs or WBCs,mucus or bacteria. Causes of 1.Specific gravity : May be variable due to disorders of urine-concentrating ability or changes in fluid status. Alkaline pH maylead to false results. 2.pH: Acid-base disorders affect the urine pH. Urinary tract infections (UTI) may producealkaline pH. 3.Protein : Increased protein is seen in glomerular diseases, infections, tubulardisorders, and exercise. Urine dipstickanalysis is sensitive for albumin. Globulinsare less easily detected. Other proteins such asBence-Jones proteins may be missed entirely. 4.Glucose : May be elevated in patients with diabetes mellitus. Elevated glucose in theurine suggests a serum glucose /H11022170 mg/dl. Can be elevated in normal individuals afterconsuming a high-glucose beverage, as wellas patients or acetone but not beta-hydroxybutyrate. 6.Blood : Any site of bleeding in the urinary tract will produce hematuria, includingglomerulonephritis, tumors, stones, infection,coagulopathy, hemolysis, or myoglobinuriawith muscle damage. 7.Bilirubin : Most commonly seen in liver and biliary disease. Complete biliary obstructionAa g r a d i e n t P OPCO 0.822- /H11005/H11002 /H11001150 Aa g r a d i e n t ( F iO (baromet ric pressure 42 - /H11005/H11003 /H11002 7mmHg)) POPCO 0.822/H11002/H11001 Interpretation of emergency laboratories 748 Appendicesis suggested when the bilirubin is positive with a negative urobilinogen. 8.Urobilinogen : Seen in hemolysis or cirrhosis. 9.Nitrites : Positive in most Gram-negative organism infections. Based organism'sability to convert urinary nitrates to nitrite. 10.Leukocyte esterase : Positive in the setting of most genitourinary tract infections. 11.Crystals : Uric acid and calcium oxalate, may be part of a normal urinalysis. Calciumoxalate is occasionally seen withnephrolithiasis. 12.Epithelial cells : Squamous or transitional cells are normal. An adequate specimen foranalysis, either by mid-stream collection orurethral catheterization should have lessthan five epithelial cells per high-powerfield. Clue cells are vaginal epithelial cells to which bacteria have been attached. 13.RBC : Indicative of glomerular injury, nephrolithiasis, inflammation, or neoplasms. 14.WBC : Counts higher than five per high- power field indicate infections of thebladder, kidney, prostate, cervix or vagina. 15.Hyaline casts : Seen in causes of proteinuria (especially diabetes), dehydration, or exercise. 16.Granular casts : RBC casts seen in glomerulonephritis; WBC casts seen inpyelonephritis. 17.Organisms : Contaminated specimens, cystitis, pyelonephritis, or prostatitis. Pearls and pitfalls 1.Accuracy of urine testing depends on thecare with which specimens are collected andtransported. Avoid specimen contaminationwith periurethral flora during collection. Useof sterile containers and prompt transport tothe laboratory may prevent microbial growth. 2.Urine specimens with high numbers ofleukocytes, RBC, presence of leukocyteesterase or nitrites, and culture colony countsof a single organism greater than 100,000colony-forming units/ml (cfu/ml) areindicators of infection. 3.The presence of one organism per oil-immersion field of stained uncentrifuged urineis indicative of greater than 100,000 cfu/ml. 4.Urine dipsticks are often used in the EDsetting. leukocyte esterase testcombined with positive nitrites is predictiveof a UTI. 5.Pyuria (defined as greater than five WBCs per high-power field) does not always indicateinfection. Sterile pyuria can be found in inflammatory conditions such as appendicitisand pelvic inflammatory disease. 6.Urine cultures should be reserved for thefollowing settings: children, pregnantwomen, immunocompromised patients,recently treated the urinary tract such as neurogenicbladder, pyelonephritis, diabetic patients,and renal dialysis patients. Pregnancy tests Tests of pregnancy include urine pregnancy tests, serum qualitative tests, and serum quantitativehuman chor ionic gonadotropin (HCG) tests. Indications 1.To identify or exclude the diagnosis of pregnancy in reproductive-aged females with vaginal bleeding, abdominal or pelvic pain,or sexual assault. 2.To determine a serum HCG for correlation with ultrasound diagnosis. 3.Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, monitoringof trophoblastic tumors, screening for fetalabnormalities. 4.Monitor the quantitative HCG in threatenedabortions. Normal values Urine tests vary in the amount of HCG needed to produce a positive test. Assays using antibodiesto the beta subunit recognizing pregnancy with 95% sen-sitivity by 1 week after the first missed menstrualcycle. During pregnancy, plasma HCG levels increase predictably, except after 20 weeks. Appendices 749Interpretation of emergency laboratories Duration of pregnancy Plasma human chorionic (weeks) gonadotropin (mU/ml) 1 normal pregnancy, HCG becomes elevated 1-2 weeks after fertilization and doubles approximately every 2 days,reaching its peak at 8-10 weeks. In ectopic pregnancy, HCG levels rise more slowly. Withtrophoblastic tumors (molar pregnancy), HCGlevels rise slowly at first, but continue to rise,reaching levels higher than expected in normal pregnancy. Spontaneous miscarriage and fetalnonviability are usually preceded by placentaland fetal tissue death, causing failure of theexpected normal rise in serum HCG. Pearls and pitfalls 1.Beta-HCG of 2000 (around 35 days gestation)should have a visible uterine gestational sacon transvaginal ultrasound. Beta-HCG of6000 (around 42 days gestation) should havea visible uterine gestational sac ontransabdominal ultrasound. 2.Ectopic pregnancies often occur at very lowHCG levels and should be aggressively soughtif clinical signs or symptoms are suggestive.HCG levels tend to be higher in normal thanabnormal pregnancy (ectopic, miscarriage). 3.Asingle quantitative HCG cannot be relied on to make decisions about a particularpregnancy; therefore serial HCGs and closefollow-up should be assured. Rh factor Definition Test of the presence or absence of antigens located on cell membranes. It is used in the context of measuring the ability of a woman to mount anti-bodies to antigens (that were obtained from thefather) that may be present on fetal RBCs. Abnormalities and causes 1.If a pregnant woman is Rh-negative, she can become sensitized to antigens and produceantibodies ( hydrops fetalis ). In order to produce such an antibody response, bloodmust cross from the fetus to the mother. Thisusually occurs during delivery, spontaneousmiscarriages, or previous transfusions(affecting subsequent pregnancies). 2.Any pregnant woman with threatenedmiscarriage or vaginal bleeding must have Rh factor determination. Rh-negative womenmust be treated with an injection of anti-Dimmune globulin (RhoGAM). 3.RhoGAM can be given in both (300 mcg). Indications pregnancy lessthan 12 weeks gestation, threatenedmiscarriage less than 12 weeks gestation, orcomplete miscarriage less than 12 weeksgestation. Full dosing should be given forectopic, threatened or complete miscarriagegreater than 12 weeks gestation, amniocentesis,or fetomaternal transfusion from trauma. Type and screen Definition Atype and screen is the determination of differ- ent antigens present on a patient's RBC. Indications 1.Anticipation of potential need for transfusion. 2.Determination of blood type for RhoGAMadministration. Type and crossmatch Definition Atype and crossmatch is the laboratory actually identifying blood for transfusion to a patient and committing the number of units ordered for thatparticular patient. Indications 1.Hemorrhagic shock. 2.HCT less than 21% without active bleeding or less than 30% with active bleeding. 3.Obvious upper sedimentation rate (ESR) is a nonspecific measure of the level of systemic Interpretation of emergency laboratories 750 Appendicesinflammation and the ability of RBCs to clump. RBC clumping increases with higher levels of fib-rinogen. Normal values Male 0-15 mm/hour Female 0-20 mm/hour Abnormalities and causes1.Increased ESR : Generally increased in any inflammatory, infectious, autoimmune, or malignant process. Striking elevations areseen in polymyalgia rheumatica andtemporal arteritis. Pearls and pitfalls 1.The ESR in many conditions is too non-specific to effectively rule in a particulardisease process. It may be falsely elevated inconditions where cold agglutinins arepresent, such as mycoplasma or Epstein-Barrvirus infections, and lymphoma. It is oftenelevated during the second trimester ofpregnancy. ESR generally increases with agein males, and decreases with age in females. Toxicology screen Toxicology screens may identify the presence or absence of illegal or abused substances, such asamphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines,cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, opiates, andphencyclidine. Toxicology screens vary from insti-tution to institution. Indications 1.General screen for the presence of illegal or abused substances from the urine. Indicatedin patients who are symptomatic and thediagnosis is unclear or questionable. Normal values Duration which certain drugs of abuse test positive: Amphetamines 2-3 days Barbiturates Varies; up to several weeks Benzodiazepines Varies depending on half- life; most up to 2-3 daysCannabinoids Up to 1 week in single use; Cocaine 8-12 hours after single use, 2-3 days in chronic users Methadone 2-3 days Opiates 1-2 days in single use; 2-4 in chronic users Phencyclidine 5-7 days after single use;1-2 weeks in chronic users Pearls and pitfalls 1.Anegative test does not necessarily exclude the presence of a drug. Many drugs are notdetected by a toxicology nitrites, thyroid 2antagonists). 2.Many false positive drug tests occur incompounds having similar chemical shape. 3.It is more appropriate to understandtoxidromic presentations and narrow thescope of toxicologic screening by directserum quantitative levels when appropriate. 4.Important specific serum drug levels can beordered when clinically necessary, includingacetaminophen, salicylic may be useful in critically-ill patients in which anunsuspected toxin may dictate a change inmanagement.
