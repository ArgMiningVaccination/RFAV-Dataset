This review aims to provide the current state of natural coagulants and their application in the purification of surface water as sufficient clean water is required for household needs, health security, and environmental safety. A thorough and systematic review of the existing literature was performed, and the information related to water treatment using natural coagulants was compiled from 237 articles under various sections using a computerized bibliographic search via PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, CAB Abstracts, and several websites. The work provides explicit information related to natural coagulants and their merits and limitations, outlines methods to increase their coagulation performance, and highlights their coagulation mechanism, efficacy, valorization potential, and sustainability. From the information obtained, it can be concluded that although chemical coagulants are efficient in WT, they are usually expensive, toxic, associated with health issues, and thus non-sustainable. A sustainable alternative is the use of natural coagulants, which are readily available, economical, easy to use, biodegradable, non-toxic, eco-friendly, effective, and generate lower sludge volumes. They work via an adsorption process that involves polymeric bridging or neutralization of the charge. The WT efficiency of natural coagulants ranges from 50-500 nephelometric turbidity units (NTUs), which is similar to chemicals. Thus, they can be deployed in WT regimes and can contribute to the health security of rural populations in developing countries. It is unfortunate that, despite the known benefits of natural coagulants, their acceptance, commercialization, and widespread industrial application across the globe are still low. Therefore, there is a need for more exhaustive investigations regarding the mode of action, adoption, and commercialization of natural coagulants as a sustainable alternative to chemicals for a circular economy.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-11-18", "cleaned_text": "Application of Natural Coagulants in Water Treatment: A Sustainable Alternative to Chemicals [https://doi.org/10.3390/w14223751](https://doi.org/10.3390/w14223751) [Coagulants/Flocculants Derived from Natural Materials for Approximately 1400 million cubic kilometers of water are available on earth, with 97.5% and 2.5% in marine and freshwater bodies, respectively [ [1](#B1-water-14-03751)]. Thousands of pollutants that are hazardous to man and ecosystems were identified in water bodies worldwide [ [3](#B3-water-14-03751)]. Water pollution is caused by several non-anthropogenic mechanisms such as hydrogeologic processes, changes in the climate, natural disasters like floods, droughts, earthquakes etc., as well as atmospheric deposition, which may be slow or fast. Such natural forces frequently result in high amounts of dissolved organic material and unsustainable quantities of specific minerals or metals [ [4](#B4-water-14-03751)]. Fluoride is found in a variety of rocks and minerals in the Earth's crust, including fluorospar, cyyolite, and through weathering processes and precipitation, contaminating surface water and groundwater, and consequently public water systems [ [8](#B8-water-14-03751), [9](#B9-water-14-03751)]. Anthropogenic influences include industrialization (nitrates, nitrites, lead, sulfur, mercury), R & D activities, urbanization, mining (metal wastes and sulphides), tourism, agricultural practices (the use of fertilizers, manures, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and crop residue), animal waste (from slaughterhouses, excreta), emerging contaminants (industrial chemicals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products), radioactive wastes (uranium), marine dumping, accidental oil spills, microplastics, and the improper disposal of sewage from various sources such as restaurants, hospitals, households, and leakage from landfills and sewer lines. Additionally, various heavy metals such as zinc, lead, copper, etc., have also been reported to pollute the water, thereby making it unfit for human use [ [10](#B10-water-14-03751), [11](#B11-water-14-03751), [12](#B12-water-14-03751)]. The release of heavy metals into the atmosphere via fossil-fuel burning and other industrial activities of humans, which eventually enter streams through rainfall, as well as the release of industrial effluents and sewage water into streams and surface water bodies, constitute the anthropogenic origin of water pollutants. The most prominent heavy-metal pollutants of human sources include chemical element such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, as well as mercury. Contaminant sources are described as either point (localized pollution) or nonpoint (pollution from different origins). Nonpoint pollutants represent the second category of pollution source, in which contaminants originate through widely scattered (and often difficult to detect) origins. Spontaneous weathering of ores and tiny metal particles in the air, water, and soils near coal-burning power plants via smokestacks is one example of localized metal contamination. The mining industry is the most common cause of metal pollution in waterways. Due to solubility, in acid solutions, they commonly utilize acid mine drainage systems to extract heavy metals from ores. They disseminate the acid solution, which contains high quantities of metals, into the groundwater after the drainage process [ [4](#B4-water-14-03751), [13](#B13-water-14-03751), [14](#B14-water-14-03751)]. In addition to heavy metals, water may be polluted by a range of contaminants due to the use of land for agriculture [ [15](#B15-water-14-03751)]. Of these pollutants, dissolved organic carbon [ [16](#B16-water-14-03751)], nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) [ [17](#B17-water-14-03751)], and pesticides [ [18](#B18-water-14-03751), [19](#B19-water-14-03751)] are the most important issues for certain land-owning UK water utilities due to the need to remove them from raw water to meet regulatory standards. Similarly, nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) loading in waterways from point and nonpoint origins is an environmental issue that influences surface water quality [ [20](#B20-water-14-03751)], as poorly managed agricultural activities can cause nutrient and insecticide pollution of surface and groundwater. Although nutrients are required for survival, excessive nutrient loading into water bodies can have an influence on the specified uses of water [ [21](#B21-water-14-03751), [22](#B22-water-14-03751)]. Nitrates in runoff can be leached or transferred [ [23](#B23-water-14-03751)]. Nitrates are tightly linked to agricultural land and grasslands [ [24](#B24-water-14-03751)], with concentrations peaking in the spring and during significant run-off occurrences. Water flow and pesticide dissemination are influenced by antecedent factors such as geography, soil type, agricultural method, and crop type [ [4](#B4-water-14-03751)]. [25](#B25-water-14-03751), [26](#B26-water-14-03751)]. Researchers have revealed that approximately 1.2 billion people are unable to obtain clean usable water and more than 6 million people die annually due to polluted-water-related issues [ [27](#B27-water-14-03751), [28](#B28-water-14-03751), [29](#B29-water-14-03751)], with 4 million people being affected by diarrhea-related issues, of which 2 million were reported to be children. Furthermore, fluoride, which is widely present in groundwater, leads to crippling skeletal fluorosis [ [26](#B26-water-14-03751)]. [30](#B30-water-14-03751), [31](#B31-water-14-03751)]. Moreover, the increasing human population and lack of water-harvesting technologies have caused vulnerability in the situation and have hiked the cost of WT [ [32](#B32-water-14-03751), [33](#B33-water-14-03751)]. Therefore, it is crucial to provide clean and safe water for human use in an effort to mitigate the spread of water-related diseases and also promote health security. - Physical data: Thes are water that need to be monitored during the treatment process, which include total suspended particles, temperature, conductivity, clarity, total dissolved solids, etc. - Chemical data: Chemical water-quality metrics of the national comprehensive discharge standard for contaminants in water, such as pH, biochemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen consumption, heavy metals, nitrates, etc. - Biological data: Waterborne microorganisms such as E. coli, mayflies, and other are examples of biomarkers. [36](#B36-water-14-03751), [37](#B37-water-14-03751), [38](#B38-water-14-03751), [39](#B39-water-14-03751), [40](#B40-water-14-03751)]. One NTU has been recommended by the WHO as the highest point of water turbidity for human use [ [41](#B41-water-14-03751)]. [42](#B42-water-14-03751)]. Although the chemical method is the most effective and commonly used technique, a transition from chemical to natural coagulants has been observed due to various limitations posed by chemical-based coagulants [ [40](#B40-water-14-03751), [43](#B43-water-14-03751)]. [44](#B44-water-14-03751), chitosan, alginate, glues, and microbial polysaccharides, which are all non-toxic. Molecule bridging, adsorption, and charge neutralization constitute the stages of the treatment process using natural coagulants. The major benefits of natural coagulants in waste water purification are that they are renewable, non-toxic, biodegradable, and cost-effective, and can efficiently remove turbidity [ [46](#B46-water-14-03751), [47](#B47-water-14-03751)]. The benefits of natural coagulants are presented in [Figure 1](#water-14-03751-f001). Therefore, natural coagulants (especially of plant origin) have drawn the attention of scientists in recent years [ [48](#B48-water-14-03751)]. 1.1. The Concept of Water Treatment [49](#B49-water-14-03751), [50](#B50-water-14-03751)]. Adsorption, UV processes, settling, and media and membrane filtration are some of the processes that constitute physical methods of WT [ [51](#B51-water-14-03751), [52](#B52-water-14-03751)]. Biological methods include phytoremediation, bioreactor processes, microbial biodegradation, and the use of wetlands [ [53](#B53-water-14-03751)]. In some cases, two or more processes are used in a hybrid manner to improve efficiency [ [48](#B48-water-14-03751), [54](#B54-water-14-03751), [55](#B55-water-14-03751)]. [56](#B56-water-14-03751), [57](#B57-water-14-03751)]. Despite their effectiveness, their use is associated with several drawbacks as they are costly and are associated with a number of environmental effects [ [57](#B57-water-14-03751), [58](#B58-water-14-03751)]. To overcome the problem associated with the use of chemical coagulants, it is necessary to promote the utilization of natural coagulants for the treatment of turbid water and wastewater. To treat polluted waters, several parameters are taken into consideration for an efficient purification process. Such parameters include the pH, initial turbidity, temperature of the water, rapid mixing and coagulant dosage, biological oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, total hardness, conductivity, acidity, alkalinity, etc., of the polluted water. [Table 1](#water-14-03751-t001)summarizes these parameters and their significance in the water purification process. 1.2. Factors Affecting WT [59](#B59-water-14-03751)]. The three vital conditions used to assess the impact of coagulant dosage in eliminating the water contaminants are under dosage, optimum dosage, and over dosage. Under dosage is the situation in which the coagulant dosage is insufficient to remove the dirt in contaminated water. Thus, an additional quantity will be needed to achieve the required level of purity [ [50](#B50-water-14-03751)]. However, using more coagulant, beyond the required quantity, will increase the impurity of the water and the excess will lead to saturation of the colloid surface. This will cause destabilization of the particles, which ultimately forms a repulsion force between the contaminants and, as a result, hinders the floc formation. 2. Strategies of Water Treatments [47](#B47-water-14-03751), [60](#B60-water-14-03751)]. However, the use of this approach is not sustainable as it leads to the production of a large volume of non-biodegradable sludge [ [61](#B61-water-14-03751)]. Natural coagulants, on the other hand, serve as an alternative sustainable strategy for the removal of turbidity and WT, as they are cheap, safe, and biodegradable. Natural coagulants are derived from three major sources, which include plants, animals, and microorganisms. A brief discussion on chemical coagulants and explicit information on natural coagulants are presented below. 2.1. Water Treatment Using Chemical Coagulants [62](#B62-water-14-03751)]. The most popular and generally used chemical coagulant in WT is 'alum', of which the chemical formula is KAl (SO4)2\u00b712H2O and the chemical name is potassium aluminum sulphate. At a pH of 8.0 and a concentration of 450 mgL1, alum eliminates 99% of the color from the turbid and water [ [63](#B63-water-14-03751)]. When combined with other coagulants, alum's potency increases. For instance, when aluminum sulphate with poly ferric sulphate (PFS) and polyacrylamide (PAA), the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency increased from 68% to 82% [ [64](#B64-water-14-03751), [65](#B65-water-14-03751)]. In a previous study, ferric chloride/iron (III) chloride at a pH of 6.0 was used as a coagulant to reduce the COD levels of water from the cosmetic industry by 63.9% [ [66](#B66-water-14-03751)]. Ferric chloride was also used to treat water from molasses and was reported to reduce the color and COD by 96% and 86%, respectively [ [67](#B67-water-14-03751)]. Chemical coagulants are effective at minimizing the chemical and biochemical oxygen demand, as well as oil and grease [ [68](#B68-water-14-03751), [69](#B69-water-14-03751)]. In another study, for the treatment of black liquor water, several chemical coagulants including aluminum chloride, poly-aluminum chloride, and anionic PAA (polyacrylamide) were used. eliminate 95% of total dissolved solids (TDS), 88% of the color, and 80% of COD [ [70](#B70-water-14-03751)]. These methods utilize additives (chemicals) to segregate small-sized particles in large flocs prior to their removal [ [71](#B71-water-14-03751), [72](#B72-water-14-03751)]. chloride and poly-titanium chloride can reduce the water turbidity from 7.0 NTU NTU [ [74](#B74-water-14-03751)]. Poly-aluminum ferric chloride at a 5mg/L concentration and pH of 7.5 can eliminate the color and turbidity from water by 86 and 100%, respectively, at pH of 7.5. Similarly, water turbidity can be reduced from 9 NTU to less than 1.0 NTU in a short span of 15 min using polymeric zinc-iron-phosphate [ [75](#B75-water-14-03751), [76](#B76-water-14-03751)]. [77](#B77-water-14-03751), [78](#B78-water-14-03751)], which leads to disease [ [79](#B79-water-14-03751), [80](#B80-water-14-03751), [81](#B81-water-14-03751)], dementia, encephalopathy, and Hippocampal neuron staining. Aluminum traces may cause diseases such as Down's syndrome and Parkinson's disease, convulsions, and even death [ [82](#B82-water-14-03751), [83](#B83-water-14-03751)]. Moreover, high operational costs, the large quantity of sludge, and the cost of disposal are some of the limitations of chemical coagulants [ [84](#B84-water-14-03751)]. 2.2. Emerging Use of Natural Coagulants [57](#B57-water-14-03751), [58](#B58-water-14-03751), [85](#B85-water-14-03751)], there is a need to explore other possible measures so as to reduce the ill effects of such coagulants on the ecosystem [ [86](#B86-water-14-03751), [87](#B87-water-14-03751), [88](#B88-water-14-03751)]. Thus, there has been a recent paradigm shift in water and WT, which encouraged industries to improve the culture of water operators in adopting and implementing sustainable development in their activities. Among functional practices is the replacement of chemicals with natural substances in WT processes, which has led to decreased environmental effects in terms of production, consumption, and secondary waste management. Natural coagulants are polyelectrolytes, which can be anionic, cationic, or neutral polymers [ [46](#B46-water-14-03751)]. They are safe and cost-effective with a great capacity to maintain the pH of the water being treated. Unlike chemical coagulants, natural coagulants do not increase the metal load during treatment and are characterized by the generation of a low volume of sludge, thereby making the cost of disposal very low [ [89](#B89-water-14-03751), [90](#B90-water-14-03751)], due to which they are a sustainable alternative to chemicals. Earlier research proved the effectiveness of natural coagulants in WT applications [ Natural Coagulants [95](#B95-water-14-03751)]. Although the crucial factor in the treatment of water is performance efficiency, the reliability of technology is also essential as per the concept of sustainability asserted by the United Nations. Thus, the concept of sustainability involves a combination of social, environmental, and financial aspects [ [96](#B96-water-14-03751)]. [Figure 2](#water-14-03751-f002)). The technical aspect of sustainability involves treatment efficiency, product stability, availability of materials, and compatibility with other techniques. Several natural coagulants have been time-tested and proven to be very efficient in the treatment of water and wastewater. Due to their natural origin, natural coagulants are considered safe and non-toxic. However, the toxicity of organic coagulants in humans and the environment still remains unclear, and there is a need to confirm their environmental safety. Thus, meticulous selection and dose optimization of efficient natural coagulants could provide promising results in WT and may act as a substitute for chemical coagulants. As discussed previously, natural coagulants offer reliability and robustness, are easily available, and can be obtained from a wide range of sources such as plants, microorganisms, or animals [ [93](#B93-water-14-03751), [97](#B97-water-14-03751), [98](#B98-water-14-03751)]. However, their susceptibility to biodegradation by microbial or other environmental factors adversely affects their long-term storage (shelf-life) and commercialization [ [99](#B99-water-14-03751), [100](#B100-water-14-03751)]. Environmental sustainability criteria involve the utilization of biodegradable and plant-based coagulants that are eco-friendly and capable of generating biodegradable sludge [ [101](#B101-water-14-03751)], which can be used for several other purposes such as agricultural practices, landfills, and in civil engineering industries [ [102](#B102-water-14-03751), [103](#B103-water-14-03751)]. [53](#B53-water-14-03751)]. Hybridizing natural coagulants with other coagulants to lower their utilization cost is an additional method to enhance the economics of WT. In contrast, the use of versatile natural coagulants may also result in a reduction in overall costs because many treatment functions can be carried out with a single substance in a single treatment unit. Moreover, as the majority of stated claims were based on lab-scale experimentation, it is challenging to translate the advantages of employing natural coagulants, such as the 'creation of fewer sludge' and 'no need for pH adjustment' into economic benefits. The 'cost-effectiveness' that is tangentially related to the advantages of employing natural coagulants must be more thoroughly evaluated in pilot studies. Because there has not been a thorough analysis of the total expenses of the coagulation process from extraction to the effects on other treatment units, we cannot draw conclusions on the economic aspect of natural coagulants [ [53](#B53-water-14-03751)]. 2.2.2. Plant-Based Coagulants [92](#B92-water-14-03751)]. There are sufficient reports on the deployment of various plant-based products such as bagasse [ [104](#B104-water-14-03751)], [105](#B105-water-14-03751)] for the treatment of polluted water. Macromolecules including proteins, polysaccharides, and some functional groups are known to promote the process of adsorption, polymer bridging, and charge neutralization [ [108](#B108-water-14-03751)]. They are usually effective in the treatment of water, with medium turbidity in the range of 50-500 NTU. However, the efficacy of natural coagulants can be enhanced through the optimization of the extraction and purification processes of coagulants [ [109](#B109-water-14-03751)]. Therefore, the proper extraction process using plant-based materials can exhibit better performance in the coagulation process, leading to greater/higher waste removal efficiency. [110](#B110-water-14-03751), [111](#B111-water-14-03751), [112](#B112-water-14-03751)]. In addition to these, seeds of nirmali are also the source of anionic polyelectrolytes, and their carboxylic acid (-COOH) and hydroxyl (-OH) boost the effectiveness of coagulation. Galactomannan and galactan, polysaccharides from the seeds of Strychno spotatorum L.fil., are potent enough to decrease water turbidity by 80%. Moreover, plants such as Acacia, Catenae, and Schinopsis can also be used to remove contaminants from water as they possess naturally occurring tannins [ [113](#B113-water-14-03751)]. Species of cactus such as Opuntia latifaria L. are also used as natural coagulants as they contain certain compounds, such as d-galactose, d-rhamanosei, d-xylose, l-arabinose, and galacturonic acid, which are responsible for the bridging action with contaminants in water during the coagulation process [ [114](#B114-water-14-03751)]. The fruit of Prunus armeniaca L. has also been reported for its use as a purifying agent in ancient periods in countries such as Egypt and China, historically dating back to the 1100s [ [115](#B115-water-14-03751)]. The form of natural coagulants used in the coagulation process can also influence turbidity removal efficiency. For example, when the seeds of Tamarindus indica L. were blended in water [ [116](#B116-water-14-03751)], it was more effective than the water extract derived from ground seeds [ [117](#B117-water-14-03751)]. In addition to turbidity removal, the common bacteria present in surface water (e.g., Escherichia coli) can also be eliminated [ [47](#B47-water-14-03751)]. The wastes of many fruits possess coagulation properties, whereas some exhibit antimicrobial activity due to the presence of saponins, phenols, and flavonoids [ [47](#B47-water-14-03751), [118](#B118-water-14-03751), [119](#B119-water-14-03751)]. It was by [ [120](#B120-water-14-03751)] and [ [121](#B121-water-14-03751)] that the colloids present in the leaves of H. undatus Haw. resemble those present in the seeds of M. oleifera Lam. and are cationic in nature. The processes of colloid adsorption and neutralization of the charge are considered feasible means of coagulation, which results in the formation of flocs. [Table 2](#water-14-03751-t002)summarizes the reports on the use of natural coagulants in WT and their relative pollutant removal efficiency. 2.2.3. Tannins [151](#B151-water-14-03751), [152](#B152-water-14-03751)]. The use of tannin extracted from valonia/Asia minor oak has been investigated by several researchers as an effective coagulant in WT [ [95](#B95-water-14-03751), [96](#B96-water-14-03751), [153](#B153-water-14-03751), [154](#B154-water-14-03751), [155](#B155-water-14-03751)]. They concluded that tannin is a superior alternative to chemical coagulants. Tannin can be used in the removal of dyes such as indigo, azo, triphenylmethanones, and anthraquinonic [ [156](#B156-water-14-03751)]. The chemical structure of tannins derived from plants and the degree of tannin modification affect their efficiency in water treatment. Tannin contains phenolic groups and is a strong anionic hydrogen donor. The phenolic groups form phenoxide due to rapid deprotonation and are balanced by resonance. It is also considered an amphoteric compound, which not only reduces the turbidity and heavy metals but also the color of water and thus functions as an alternative to chemical coagulants. Thus, it can be concluded that the higher the number of phenolics, the greater the capacity to coagulate will be. 2.2.4. Nirmali Seeds [157](#B157-water-14-03751)]. The seeds of this plant have been reported to have been used over 4000 years ago as a natural coagulant in the treatment of water [ [158](#B158-water-14-03751), [159](#B159-water-14-03751)]. The majority of research on its usage as a natural coagulant is confined to the Indian sub-continent [ [117](#B117-water-14-03751), [161](#B161-water-14-03751)]. anionic polyelectrolytes that use coagulation (charge neutralization and bridging) for the removal of contaminants in water [ [162](#B162-water-14-03751)]. It has been observed that the coagulation efficiency can be increased due to the presence of alkaloids, lipids, and carbohydrates containing-COOH and free -OH groups present on the surface. In a previous study, galactomannan and galactan obtained from nirmali seeds reduced the turbidity of a kaolin solution by approximately 80% [ [163](#B163-water-14-03751)]. The presence of -OH groups, along with galactan and galactomannan chains, is mainly responsible for the water-cleaning property. 2.2.5. Moringa Seeds [164](#B164-water-14-03751)] belonging to the Moringaceae family. M. oleifera Lam. is non-toxic and is the most frequently identified natural coagulant utilized for WT [ [165](#B165-water-14-03751)]. In addition to its use as a source of food, fodder, and medicine, each part of the Moringa plant, including the leaves, seeds, flowers, roots, and bark, can be used as a coagulant for WT [ [166](#B166-water-14-03751), [167](#B167-water-14-03751), [168](#B168-water-14-03751)]. The seeds of Moringa, in addition to containing edible oil, also contain substances that are soluble in water [ [169](#B169-water-14-03751)]. Muller et al. [ [170](#B170-water-14-03751)] and Jahn et al. [ [171](#B171-water-14-03751)] were among the pioneer researchers who reported the use of M. oleifera Lam. seeds for the coagulation process in WT. Muyibi et al. [ [172](#B172-water-14-03751)] also reported it to be a minimal or low-cost natural coagulant that can be feasibly deployed in WT, at least in rural or semi-urban areas. The work of Ndabigengesere et al. [ [169](#B169-water-14-03751)], which reported the coagulation property of Moringa seeds in the treatment of water, ignited interest among environmental scientists. The active coagulating agents present in Moringa seeds are reported to be cationic proteins, which are dimeric in nature, possess an isoelectric point between 10 and 11 and a molecular weight of 12-14 kDa, and function via charge neutralization and adsorption mechanisms. [173](#B173-water-14-03751)] also reported that protein is the active ingredient of coagulation in Moringa seeds, possessing a mass of 6.5 kDa and an isoelectric point higher than 10. In a similar report, other researchers [ [174](#B174-water-14-03751)] stated that the protein has an isoelectric point greater than 9.6 and a mass of 6.5 kDa. In contrast to the aforementioned reports, [ [175](#B175-water-14-03751)] reported that the coagulating agent is an organic polyelectrolyte rather than a polysaccharide, protein, or lipid, with a molecular mass of 3.0 kDa. [176](#B176-water-14-03751)]. These bind with impurity particles, which are usually negatively charged. Okuda et al. reported that the coagulation performance of Moringa extracts can be improved by using bivalent cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+) [ [175](#B175-water-14-03751)]. Sulaiman et al. [ [177](#B177-water-14-03751)] used the seeds of Moringa in WT and observed excellent results. Dotto et al. [ [178](#B178-water-14-03751)] used the same method in the treatment of textile mill water and a significant COD reduction was reported. For the treatment of water from the dairy industry, seed powder was able to remove ~100% of the turbidity and 99.50-100% of the fecal coliform count. In a similar report, the seed powder could remove ~ 83.63% of the turbidity from laundry water [ [179](#B179-water-14-03751)]. Hence, M. oleifera is among the most versatile and reliable natural coagulants and has been proven to be a promising sustainable alternative to chemical coagulants. 2.2.6. Chickpea Seeds [180](#B180-water-14-03751)] and Jaseela et al. [ [181](#B181-water-14-03751)] used chickpea seeds to treat water released from the dairy industry and reported the removal of turbidity of 86.29%. Another group reported a more than 95% reduction of preliminary turbidity, which was similar to that of alum [ [182](#B182-water-14-03751)]. Choy et al. (2015) reported that the presence of high sugar and protein contents in chickpea were mainly responsible for the removal/coagulation of particles [ [92](#B92-water-14-03751)]. 2.2.7. Peanut Seeds [183](#B183-water-14-03751)]. The lipid part of the peanut constitutes approximately half of its dry weight, but the lipid does not contribute to its purification properties. As a result, the relative percentage of the active agent is markedly decreased, leading to lower efficiency in the removal of raw surface-water turbidity. Mataka et al. [ [184](#B184-water-14-03751)] reported that peanut seeds exhibit a similar effect as that of moringa seeds, and delipidated cakes were found to be more effective (in the removal of heavy metals from wastewater) than the crude seed extract. Therefore, the effectiveness of peanut coagulation activity can be increased by removing the lipidic portion from the seeds. 2.2.8. Soybean Seeds [185](#B185-water-14-03751), [186](#B186-water-14-03751)]. The coagulation efficiency of soybean seeds was excellent in the clarification of surface water beyond 450 NTU, whereas, as a coagulant aid to alum, ~96% turbidity removal was reported [ [186](#B186-water-14-03751)]. Although soybean seeds have a large lipid fraction that is considered second to groundnut, the lipid part does not contribute to coagulation activities. Therefore, seed delipidation (the removal of lipids) improves the coagulation potential. Moreover, deoiled seeds of soybeans have been reported to be less expensive bioadsorbents for the treatment of water contaminated by different dyes [ [93](#B93-water-14-03751), [187](#B187-water-14-03751), [188](#B188-water-14-03751)]. Soybean seeds possess palmitic acid, whereas stearic acid found in Hibiscus esculentus has been associated with bactericidal activities. Thus, their extracts have potential anti-bacterial properties and can treat raw surface water [ [183](#B183-water-14-03751), [189](#B189-water-14-03751)]. 2.2.9. Cacti Mucilage [150](#B150-water-14-03751)]. Opuntia possesses a high coagulation capacity due to the presence of mucilage, which is a complex carbohydrate, and, hence, it is used as a potential coagulant for treating water [ [190](#B190-water-14-03751), [191](#B191-water-14-03751)]. Thus, it is eco-friendly and can be used as an alternative to aluminum and iron salts due to its abundance, renewability, adaptability, and biodegradability [ [66](#B66-water-14-03751)]. Rebah et al. also reported the potential of Opuntia in the treatment of wastewater [ [192](#B192-water-14-03751)]. Opuntia's mucilage has different sugar molecules including d-galactose, d-xylose, l-rhamnose, l-arabinose, and galacturonic acid active coagulating agent is galacturonic acid [ [193](#B193-water-14-03751)], which contributes to the removal of 50% turbidity. Galacturonic acid may also exist in a polymeric form as polygalacturonic acid. It is anionic due to the presence of carboxylic functional groups, which undergo partial deprotonation in an aqueous solution [ [194](#B194-water-14-03751)]. The mucilage in Opuntia species functions mainly via adsorption and the bridging coagulation process in which dirt particles bind to the mucilage and facilitates the removal of turbidity. 2.2.10. Okra Seed Extract [195](#B195-water-14-03751)] who asserted that seeds extracted using distilled water and a sodium chloride solution can be used as organic coagulants for the removal of turbidity from water with an efficiency of 54.5% and 92% for distilled water and a NaCl (1.0 N) solution, respectively. Raji et al. [ [196](#B196-water-14-03751)] discovered that okra seed extracts were very effective in the removal of turbidity from 580 to 5 NTU at a dose of 300 mg/L and pH 7.0, which is within the standard limit recommended by WHO. Similar work conducted by Thakur et al. [ [197](#B197-water-14-03751)] and Mishra et al. [ [198](#B198-water-14-03751)] revealed that okra seed extracts can effectively remove dirt from the water even at a dose of 200 mg/L. The work of [ [174](#B174-water-14-03751)] also shows the effectiveness of okra seed extracts in WT with more than 69% and 95% removal efficiencies for dissolved and suspended solids (from the effluents), respectively. 2.3. Animal-Based Coagulants [199](#B199-water-14-03751)]. The deployment of chitosan as a natural coagulant in the treatment of polluted water in different sectors, including agriculture, textile, detergent, and food industries, as well as paper mills, has been well reported [ [200](#B200-water-14-03751), [201](#B201-water-14-03751)]. The characteristic feature of chitosan regarding cleaning water is its ability to react and generate a positive charge that destabilizes the negative charge of the colloidal particles [ [202](#B202-water-14-03751)]. Actinobacteria are also effective in the treatment of contaminated water [ [203](#B203-water-14-03751)]. Efficient flocculating activity was observed when Cellulomonas and Stretptomyces spp. were deployed as flocculants in the treatment of kaolin-contaminated water. The substantial effects of these species were shown to be due to the presence of several molecules including proteins, natural sugar, polysaccharides, and uric acid, as indicated by chemical analysis [ [199](#B199-water-14-03751)]. Chitin is a naturally occurring and the second-most abundant polysaccharide (after cellulose). Every year, at least 10 gigatons of chitin are synthesized and destroyed throughout the biosphere. Chitin is a renewable resource found mainly in complexes with other polysaccharides and proteins. Chitin and its metabolites are utilized as chelating agents in the purification of water by segregating organic substances and heavy metals, as well as in the treatment of sewage via the precipitation of certain anionic wastes and the collection of contaminants such as PCBs (polychlorobenzene). The utilization of 10 mg per liter of chitosan in water has already received approval from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [ [204](#B204-water-14-03751)]. 3. Extraction of Natural Coagulants [174](#B174-water-14-03751), [175](#B175-water-14-03751)]. The tertiary stage is a rather uncommon method because it involves high costs and is mostly limited to academic research [ [174](#B174-water-14-03751), [175](#B175-water-14-03751)]. The major objective of of tertiary water treatment is to improve the water quality to attain the standard domestically, industrially, and the specific needs regarding the safe discharge of water. Tertiary treatment of water also deals with the removal of microbes/pathogens, which ensures that water is safe for drinking purposes in the case of water treated by municipalities [ [174](#B174-water-14-03751), [175](#B175-water-14-03751)]. The natural coagulant extraction process is shown in [Figure 3](#water-14-03751-f003). 4. Mechanism of Action of Natural Coagulants [59](#B59-water-14-03751)]. This approach is crucial for water pretreatment as it removes dispersed/suspended contaminants and grants purified water the requisite quality for further processing. The global market for coagulants is expected to exceed USD 6.01 billion by the end of 2022, representing a 5.9% compound annual increase from 2017 to 2022 (4.35 billion in 2016) [ [59](#B59-water-14-03751)]. [Figure 4](#water-14-03751-f004). The green circles represent the positively charged coagulants and the red colored circles represent the negatively charged colloidal particles. The mode of action of natural coagulants can be grouped into sweep flocculation, charge neutralization, double-layer compression, and antiparticle bridging. Sweep flocculation/coagulation is seen as a technique that eliminates colloids via entrapment/enmeshment using a net-like structure containing amorphous metal hydroxide precipitates that are formed by the hydrolysis process [ [205](#B205-water-14-03751)]. Several analyses including initial floc-aggregation, the relative settling factor, and the flocculation index revealed that the flocs developed through this method are relatively smaller in size with good settling capacity but are characterized by a slow rate of floc formation [ [205](#B205-water-14-03751)]. The floc produced via sweep flocculation has a high fractal dimension, which shows that flocs are complex [ [206](#B206-water-14-03751)]. Stronger flocs that are tolerant of breakage are theoretical features of the high fractal dimension. However, the flocs of sweep flocculation are large with greater floc production but are easily broken. Charge neutralization occurs via the adsorption process between the coagulants and the colloid surface, which are oppositely charged [ [193](#B193-water-14-03751)]. Before reacting with the colloids, chemical coagulants undergo a hydrolysis process to form several cationic species. A patch-wise medium referred to as the electrostatic patch mechanism is deployed for the charge neutralization process. Various cationic species will patch on the surface of the colloids resulting in particle surfaces with positive and negative charges. Colloids' surfaces with a mixed charge will reduce the repulsive forces and increase van der Waals forces between particles [ [207](#B207-water-14-03751)]. Flocs produced via the charge neutralization method are stronger than those developed by sweep flocculation but weaker than those formed through inter particle bridging, despite their globular-shaped smaller particles [ [205](#B205-water-14-03751)], and also have a greater fractal dimension [ [193](#B193-water-14-03751)]. Double-layer compression is an approach that employs ions with the opposite charge of the colloidal particles to infiltrate the double layer that surrounds the colloids. Counter ions will make the double layer thinner and smaller in volume [ [208](#B208-water-14-03751)]. Continuous electrolyte compression reduces the electrostatic repulsion and increases van der Waals forces, facilitating the joining of the two destabilized colloids [ [205](#B205-water-14-03751)]. The flocs produced via this mechanism are larger in size because the rate of aggregation of the particles is high. However, they have a low level of sedimentation due to certain friction forces unnecessarily forming between the larger flocs. Moreover, the floc strength of the coagulants depends on the ionic charge of the coagulant. Monovalent ions that are weakly charged will produce large but loose flocs that require a longer time to settle. Nevertheless, the double layer is significantly charged with a high repulsive force towards weakly charged ions, which lessens the likelihood of agglomeration. The inter particle bridging relies on polymers that exist as a long chain with a highly reactive group dangling in the water. A particular region of the polymeric chain will attach itself to colloids, while the unattached portions of the polymeric chain attach to other colloidal particles to form a complex colloid-polymer-colloid structure in which the polymer serves as a bridge. The flocs that form are flaky with irregular void space between the network structures. Furthermore, the fractal dimension of the formed floc is low, which indicates it is not as complex as flocs formed by other mechanisms [ [48](#B48-water-14-03751)]. Theoretically, a low fractal dimension leads to the formation of weak flocs that are prone to breakage, but they are very strong and not easily broken into smaller clusters due to polymers that serve as bridges [ [52](#B52-water-14-03751)]. A study shows that the use of natural coagulants with the inter-particle bridging mechanism enhances the growth of the floc by at least thrice compared to the use of synthetic chemicals due to the ability of polymeric chains to stretch and get attached to as several colloids as possible [ [59](#B59-water-14-03751)]. [176](#B176-water-14-03751)]. Polyelectrolytes possessing a high charge density show maximum flocculation ability. 5. Natural Coagulants\u2014Constraints in Commercialization [47](#B47-water-14-03751)]. Furthermore, Saleem et al. [ [93](#B93-water-14-03751)] the ionic nature (cationic, anionic, and non-ionic) of coagulants and explored the barriers to their application and commercialization. The outcomes of the current studies are mostly restricted to the laboratory scale, having less relevance in real industrial applications. For natural coagulants to be successfully commercialized, there is a need for economically feasible extraction procedures and in-depth knowledge regarding their mode of action. Moreover, for any new products to be commercialized, approval from the relevant authority and other regulatory authorities must be granted, which is somewhat difficult as it requires ensuring product compliance with the respective standards. Strong motivation for green chemistry and cleaner production are crucial for the development of natural coagulants and their applications. [Figure 5](#water-14-03751-f005)outlines the constraints hindering the successful industrialization of natural coagulants. Among the major issues, the raw materials required to generate natural coagulants must be available at a large scale for successful and realistic applications. Furthermore, the technical support of experts and new equipment are required to sustainably implement the deployment of natural coagulants [ [108](#B108-water-14-03751)]. 6. Future Prospects of Natural Coagulants [209](#B209-water-14-03751), [210](#B210-water-14-03751)]. Natural coagulants derived from plants have the ability to replace synthetic coagulants for the treatment of wastewater from the textile industry [ [92](#B92-water-14-03751)]. There is a plethora of reports that highlight the performance of natural coagulants based on their flocculation or coagulation potential in WT but all have their own limitations that need to be investigated, improved, or overcome for fine-tuning and process improvement. [203](#B203-water-14-03751)]. The significant increase in the organic residues of treated water is unacceptable and can lead to an increase in microbial activity, which further results in changes in color appearance, bad odors, and bad tastes [ [203](#B203-water-14-03751)]. Moreover, crude plant-based products have several inorganic and organic molecules such as fats and oils that do not contribute to the process of active coagulation [ [174](#B174-water-14-03751)]. Therefore, the meticulous optimization of physico-chemical parameters prior to its implementation on a large scale is crucial. Unfortunately, this requires more time and effort because the physical-chemical characteristics of water change over time. The major obstacle in introducing plant-based natural coagulants in industries is their lack of year-round availability in order to meet industrial requirements. Moreover, the processing technology required and the cost of processing/production are also limitations. In addition to this, there are several other issues including the choice/possibility and source/availability of the plants to be used. For instance, the use of Jatropha curcas seeds in WT has been associated with safety issues [ [148](#B148-water-14-03751)]. Among the issues related to the use of plant products (e.g., cereal crops) is the escalation in market prices of unprocessed grain due to increases in the human population and decreases in agricultural production [ [211](#B211-water-14-03751)]. Direct comparisons of coagulant forms, production stages, and costs involved in different geographical regions are extremely difficult due to differences in exchange rates, inflation factors, and cost value accuracies [ [46](#B46-water-14-03751)]. The needs and responses of markets will also influence the demand for natural coagulants as an alternative to chemicals. Although natural coagulants will not be commercialized immediately, these small initiatives will help to bridge the gaps and overcome the limitations ( [Figure 4](#water-14-03751-f004)). An appraisal of the social, economic, and ecological aspects can be maintained as a sustainability metric with the use of a pilot plant analysis. The approval of local authorities should be simple for the effective marketing of any new product [ [212](#B212-water-14-03751)]. As a remedy to the problem, policy framers should implement tax rebates, subsidy programs, tax reductions, incentives, and environmental laws and regulations so as to encourage reliance on plant-based natural coagulants. [213](#B213-water-14-03751)]. Research on the active chemicals discovered in plant-based natural coagulants is another factor to consider when employing natural coagulants to improve coagulation-flocculation (CF) performance. The processes for identifying and isolating active coagulating compounds are too challenging due to the probability of interdependent effects among the components present [ [47](#B47-water-14-03751), [203](#B203-water-14-03751)]. Moreover, the coagulant type and dosage, total dissolved solids in the contaminated water, the distribution and size of colloidal particles of the water, the temperature of the water, ionic strength of the coagulants, pH of the water, and the configuration and percentage of organic matter in water are some of the factors that influence the coagulation CF effectiveness of the polluted water [ [214](#B214-water-14-03751), [215](#B215-water-14-03751)]. [47](#B47-water-14-03751)]. Plant-based coagulants must thus be chosen for large-scale application based on the availability of annual species. Thus, meticulous research, tests, and trials are needed to find the most efficient natural coagulant or a hybrid of natural and chemical coagulants or natural coagulants alone, for the treatment of water [ [216](#B216-water-14-03751)]. [217](#B217-water-14-03751), [218](#B218-water-14-03751), [219](#B219-water-14-03751)]. Biochar technology is considered a novel, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly resource that can be used as reliable technology in water treatment [ [220](#B220-water-14-03751), [221](#B221-water-14-03751), [222](#B222-water-14-03751)]. Biochar has been widely utilized as an adsorptive agent to eliminate metal contaminants, biological pollutants, and nutrients from the water. Thus, it can play a key role in environmental cleaning and reflects the concept of \"treating wastes with wastes\", for a sustainable, circular economy. There are two substantial benefits behind the application of biochar for WT viz; (i) its production prevents the release of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, thus decreasing the impact of global warming in our environment [ [223](#B223-water-14-03751)], and (ii) biochar has a large surface area with numerous surface functional groups. These features have made it an effective, cheap, and ecologically safer adsorbent for WT [ [224](#B224-water-14-03751), [225](#B225-water-14-03751), [226](#B226-water-14-03751)]. 'Engineered biochar' has also been developed, which possesses a larger surface area, higher adsorption ability, and more widely available surface functional groups (SFG) than the normal biochar/activated carbon, indicating that it is a new type of carbon-based material with promising potential in treating water contaminated with agro-chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and metalloids/metals generated from agro-industrial activities and municipal waste [ [219](#B219-water-14-03751), [222](#B222-water-14-03751), [227](#B227-water-14-03751), [228](#B228-water-14-03751)]. It may also be used for the improvement of soil fertility, crop growth, and production [ [218](#B218-water-14-03751)], and for the production of clean energy, so as to partially replace fossil fuels [ [229](#B229-water-14-03751)]. It is also applied as an adsorbent and catalyst to different contaminants and reduces the emissions of greenhouse gases [ [218](#B218-water-14-03751), [230](#B230-water-14-03751), [231](#B231-water-14-03751)]. Rajapaksha et al. [ [232](#B232-water-14-03751)] mentioned that sulfamethazine can be removed effectively from the contaminated water using steam-activated biochar but the rate of such contaminant removal is pH dependent. Heavy metals from agricultural wastewater such as As, Cu, and Pb constitute another pervasive issue. The potential of biochar to remove these pollutants was reported to be 69.4 mg/g and 34.1 mg/g for Cu2+ and As5+, respectively, while the quantities for Cd2+ and Pb2+ were found to be 0.4 mg/g to 12.3 mg/g and 36 mg/g to 35 mg/g, respectively [ [233](#B233-water-14-03751), [234](#B234-water-14-03751), [235](#B235-water-14-03751)]. Biochar is also important for the treatment of polluted stormwater. Thus, the use of organic coagulants from plants and animal sources, including the application of biochar technology, represents a new, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly solution for WT. A recent study by Liu et al. [ [236](#B236-water-14-03751)] demonstrates that biochar impregnated with aluminum can significantly eliminate contaminants such as Zn2+, Cu2+, As5+, and other runoff contaminants in urban runoff water. Removal rates greater than 85% and 95% were determined when a biochar-based filtration medium was deployed to remove copper and zinc in polluted runoff stormwater. However, there is a need for careful testing and designing of the filtration media to achieve success in stormwater treatment systems [ [237](#B237-water-14-03751)]. 7.
