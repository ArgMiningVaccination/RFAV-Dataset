The objective of the present study was to comparatively evaluate the qualitative and quantitative analysis of phytochemical constituents of leaves of Murraya koenigii (L.) Spreng., Tinospora cordifolia (Wild) Hook.f., Enicostemma axillare (Lam) A. Raynal, and Gymnema sylvestre R. Br. were collected from Jaffna District. The shade-dried leaves were powdered and extracted with ethanol using the cold extraction technique. These ethanolic extracts were subjected to phytochemical analysis using recommended laboratory techniques. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's multiple comparisons at probability value (p <0.05) were used in the statistical analysis of the data. Phytochemical screening showed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids, steroids, saponins, phenols, and glycosides. Murraya koenigii shows the highest phenol and alkaloid contents (1960.71\u00b166.88 and 19.42\u00b10.26). Enicostemma axillare shows the highest flavonoid and tannin contents (22.27\u00b10.86 and 1.26\u00b10.017). Therefore, E. axillare and M. koenigii can be used as nutraceuticals in traditional medicine.", "sitename": "Borneo Journal of Pharmacy -", "date": "2018-05-01", "cleaned_text": "Themes by Openjournaltheme.com Novelty OJS 3 Theme by openjournaltheme.com theme Quick jump to page content Main Navigation Main Content Sidebar Borneo Journal of Pharmacy Register Login Online ISSN : 2621-4814 Toggle navigation Home About About the Journal Abstracting and Indexing Publication Frequency Journal History Citedness in Scopus Citedness in Web of Science Article Statistics Journal Diversity Subscribers Sponsorship Journal Policy Aims and Scope Publication Ethics and Malpractice Statement Retraction, Withdrawal, and Correction (R-W-C) Policy Editorial Policies Peer-Review Policy Open Access Policy Licensing Policy Archiving Policy Plagiarism Policy Study Ethics and Ethical Clearance Policy Informed Consent Policy Conflict of Interest Policy People Editorial Board Acknowledgment for past Peer-Reviewers Publisher Contact Issue Current Archives Accepted Manuscripts Author Index Submit Article Submissions Author Guidelines Article Processing Charge Copyright Notice Privacy Statement Announcements Search "}
