Read - [Sun Allergy - Causes, Symptoms and Ayurvedic Treatment](https://www.iafaforallergy.com/allergies-a-to-z/sun-allergy/) Abstract Sun Allergy is a type of Skin Allergy where the patient experiences burning of the skin along with intense itching, rashes, hives and blisters after exposing themselves to the sun radiation for a small period. The exact cause of the condition is unknown, but in Ayurveda, we believe that it's because of the elevation of Pitta Dosha in our body, and having a positive family history exaggerates the condition. The modern Allopathic creams, cosmetics and medicines provide symptomatic relief and there are chances of again getting attacked after the termination of the treatment. But, fortunately, Ayurveda provides us with treatment options that can cure the condition and prevent it from recurring. Along with herbs, Yoga Asanas, and the food diet prescribed by Dr. Sahil Gupta the founder of IAFA\u00ae, has treated many patients worldwide and has gotten immense results within a 3 months span. Keywords: Sun Allergy, Solar Urticaria, Pitta Doshas Imbalance, Ayurvedic Treatment, Natural Treatment Introduction Sun Allergy aka Solar Urticaria, usually occurs more in women compared to men and that too when they are exposed to solar radiation. As per Ayurveda, when our body is exposed to solar radiation or the elements that elevate the Pitta Dosha in our body, it causes an imbalance in the 3 Doshas leading to an increase in the Pitta Dosha, thereby resulting in the occurrence of allergic reactions. In patients with Sun Allergy, we can see rashes of various sizes and shapes, redness of the skin, blisters, and intense itching, especially under the sun. These symptoms may be exaggerated by consuming foods with higher fire elements or by using chemicals or cosmetics which produce allergic reactions in the skin.
