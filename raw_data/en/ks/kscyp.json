What's New in My Turn? -Release 36 Coming Soon: Vaccinating Children Transitioning from a Younger to Older Age Group 28 The CDC has issued guidelines regarding the administration of the Pfizer Infant / Toddler vaccine to childrenwho transition to a different age group before completing their primary series. Previously, you could not document this in My Turn. With Release 36, Clinic Managersand Vaccine Administrators may now document the completion of the primary series that was started in My Turn through the walk-in flow.

Please be sure to complete any necessary tasks before the scheduled upgrade time. 30myCAvaxR35 and State Flu Go Live Announcement State Flu is targeted to go-live in myCAvax for LHJs and Selected Providers early March 2023. Attend future webinars for updates! myCAvaxRelease 35 went live yesterday,February 9, 2023. This release includes important data clean up and system fixes that will improve overall user experience. 31Limited COVID-19 Bivalent Infant / Toddler Vaccine Supply of the Pfizer Bivalent Infant / Toddler (6 months -4 years) vaccine and the Moderna Bivalent Infant / Toddler (6 months -5years) vaccine remains limited.Administration rates for the primary series with Monovalent products remain low, so there are a limited number of infants/toddlers that are eligible for a Bivalent Booster. In addition, there is significant inventory already ordered on-hand throughout the state. The state is not expecting additional inventory from CDC at this time.Providers may still submit orders for this product as needed.LHDs / MCEs should submit requests for inventory by emailing the COVID-19 Provider Call Center atcovidcallcenter@cdph.ca.govor tagging the Ordering Leads Chatter group (@Ordering Leads). Please provide a rationale behind the need and confirmation that the Provider's on-hand inventory and administration data have been reviewed in the request.32Recommendations to Reduce COVID-19 Bivalent Infant / Toddler Wastage To reduce waste, LHDs / MCEs should advise providers to: Place small orders and re-order as inventory is used up, even if this means placing more frequent orders. CDPH will continue to respond to requests as needed.Utilize theVaccine Marketplaceto share and obtain excess vaccines with neighboring Providers.If possible, schedule infants / toddlers on the same day to maximize vaccination opportunities.Be sure to report wasted vaccine in myCAvax so CDPH has an accurate view of vaccine supply.Check outWastage and Missed Vaccination Opportunitiesin the Provider Operations Manual for more information. 33Placing Requests / Reports on the Vaccine Marketplace To reduce wastage and maximize existing vaccine product, Providers can report and request excess doses of the Pfizer and Moderna Bivalent Infant / Toddler vaccines on the Vaccine Marketplace.

My Turn Best Practices (A 2023 House Cleaning Guide) 37 Best Practice How To1.Set clinic duration for three months to avoid having defunct clinics listed on the public site.You can create clinics before making them visible to the public using the 'Clinic Visibility' settings. Set an appropriate \"Available Date\" that you'd like the public to begin booking appointments.2.Create one clinic per location that supports multiple vaccines and brands to simplify management and updates.If you have multiple clinics at the same location offering different vaccine products, combine all clinics into one. You can combine clinics by: oEnding all existing clinics and use the 'Clinic Set Up Wizard' to create a new clinic with all vaccine brands. oAdding the appropriate Vaccine Inventory and Supply to an existing clinic and ending all other clinics. Export Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) data within 4 weeks.Visit the My Turn Known Issues for workarounds creating clinics with multiple vaccines.

FDA recognizes that, in rare instances, individuals with a recent known exposure (e.g., a household contact) who develop signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19 may be diagnosed by their health care provider as having COVID-19 even if they have a negative direct SARS-CoV-2 viral test result. In such instances, their health care provider may determine that treatment with Paxlovid or Lagevrio(molnupiravir) for COVID-19 is appropriate if the patient reports mild-to-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 and is at high-risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death., and the terms and conditions of the authorization are met, as detailed in the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers.
