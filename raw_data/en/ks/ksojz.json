As you were checking off boxes that apply to you\u2014you might have thought \"What does this have to do with my visit!?\" This form is related to the Five Element Theory, which is derived from Chinese Medicine. The theory outlines the relationship between the different elements in nature and the life force, or \"qi,\" that flows through them. The Five Element theory describes wood, fire, earth, metal, and water as the basic elements of the material world. In Chinese medicine, elements help us understand the patient and their personality. It also helps us determine the best and most [effective treatment plan](/). What are the Five Elements? The 5 Elements are continually evolving and changing within you, and some elements become stronger and more dominant at different stages in life. The five elements help explain physiology and pathology within the body. Each element has unique characteristics and are associated with season, weather, color, personality type, and symptoms/disease states. Wood If you are a \"Wood Personality,\" you may be someone who is athletic, energetic, and adventurous. The body type of a wood personality is generally well-muscled. Wood personalities tend to be anxious and angry. Wood personalities may suffer from orthopedic issues, TMJ, migraines, or ADD. - Organs: Liver & Gallbladder - Season: Spring - Weather: Wind - Direction: East - Emotion: Anger - Color: Blue/Green - Taste: Sour - Sound: Shouting - Sense Eye - Sensation: Vision - Body Tissue: tendons, sinews Fire - Organs: Heart, Small Intestine - Season: Summer - Weather: Heat - Direction: South - Emotion: Joy - Color: Red - Taste: Bitter, Burned - Sound: Laughing - Sense Organ: Tongue - Sensation: Taste - Body Tissue: Vessels Earth An \"earth personality\" is someone who is nurturing, generous, and care giving.

Wood feeds Fire, Fire makes Earth, Earth creates Metal, Metal holds Water, and Water nourishes Wood. Wood roots Earth, Earth dams Water, Water extinguishes Fire, Fire melts Metal, and Metal cuts Wood. Each element both controls and is controlled by another element. The system is connected, moving, and constantly in a process of balance. One element may manifest heavier within us than others. This is where we are strongest, yet most vulnerable. Acupuncture & The Meridians Meridians are invisible rivers of energy that run through the body in channels. Our life energy (\"qi\") flows along these meridians, and when it is blocked or disrupted pain, discomfort, and illness can occur. [Acupuncture](/treatments/acupuncture) treatment involves transferring energy from one element to another creating balance again. There are 12 main meridians in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and each meridian is associated with a different body organ. Acupuncture needles target specific points on specific meridians, and this restores proper energy flow. The Elements and Your Treatment Plan At Alliance, our main goal is to treat the patient, not the just the symptoms. When elements become unbalanced, symptoms and diseases start to develop. The Five Elements help us understand imbalances within the body and where shifts need to occur to restore balance. Depending on the patient's personality, we can gauge what symptoms they are most prone to experiencing and help prevent future illness. By determining the elements within the patient and utilizing the ancient practice of acupuncture, we help treat health issues, maintain well-being, and transform lives. Our medical doctors are trained in acupuncture by the renowned [Helms Medical Institute](https://hmieducation.com/) through UCLA and Stanford University.
