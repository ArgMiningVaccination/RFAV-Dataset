Olin College is located in Needham, Massachusetts and was founded in 1997. The le gal name of the college is Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. History Olin College is named for Franklin W. Olin (1860- 1951), an engineer, entrepreneur and professional baseball player. Although he lacked a high school diploma, he qua lified through self -study for entrance to Cornell University, where he majored in civil engineering and was captain of the baseball team. He played major league baseball during the summers to finance his education. He went on to found the company known today as the Olin Corporation, a Fortune 1000 company. In 1938, Mr. Olin transferred a large part of his personal wealth to a private philanthropic foundation. In two- thirds of a century of existence, the F. W. Olin Foundation awarded grants totaling more than $800 million to construct and fully equip 78 buildings on 58 independent college campuses. In 1997, the Foundation announced its intention to create Olin College, its mos t ambitious project. In subsequent years, the Foundation transferred its assets to the college, for a total commitment of $460 million, one of the largest grants in the history of American higher education. The Foundation's generosity enabled Olin to s tart from a \"clean slate\" in designing its academic program, and, in the philanthropic spirit of Franklin W. Olin, to provide a tuition merit scholarship to every student. The faculty worked with 30 student \"partners\" in the year prior to the formal opening of the college to design the curriculum. The college welcomed its first freshman class in August 2002. In creating the college, the Foundation was responding to calls for fundamental reform of engineering education from the National Science Foundation, the National Academy of Engineering, the accrediting organizations and the corporate comm unity. To better prepare graduates for the challenges of the twenty- first century, these groups recommended that engineering education include more project -based learning, interdisciplinary teaching, and a greater emphasis on entrepreneurship, teamwork and communication. Olin College incorporated these suggestions, along with creative ideas of its own, into an innovative, hands -on curriculum that is attracting worldwide attention as a new model for engineering education. Engineering education at Olin is in the liberal arts tradition, with a strong emphasis on the arts, humanities, social sciences, entrepreneurship, and design. Olin is committed to producing graduates who recognize the complexity of the world, who appreciate the relationship of their work to society and who are dedicated to creative enterprises for the good of humankind. Olin College graduated its first class in May 2006. Members of that class and subsequent classes have gone on to graduate study and employment at many of the nation's top graduate schools and corporations. A significant proportion of the graduates have started entrepreneurial ventures, while others have sought alternative post -graduate occupations. On July 1, 2020, Gilda A. Barabino became the second president of Olin College of Engineering, and Professor of Biomedical and Chemical Engineering. A biomedical engineer trained in chemical engineering, with broad interest in global health, systems, and interdisciplinary engineering education, Dr. Barabino is a noted investigator in the areas of sickle cell disease, cellular and tissue engineer ing. She is an internationally recognized thought leader and highly sought after speaker and consultant on race/et hnicity and gender in science and engineering, with particular focus on creating cultures and climates that support a sense of belonging. She ha s led a number of initiatives in these areas including serving as the founder and Executive Director of the Nati onal Institute for Faculty Equity. Dr. Barabino is an active member of the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Medicine and serves on numerous committees of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, including the Roundtable on Black Men and Black Women in Science, Engineering and Medicine; the Health and Medicine Division Committee; and the Committee on Women in Science Engineering and Medicine which she chairs. Information about Olin Information about Olin| 5 The arrival of Olin's next president offered an oppor tunity for the community to reflect on the accomplishments of the college's first decade, to recommit to the founding values of innovation and collaboration, and to set an ambitious agenda for Olin's future. In 2021, Dr. Barabino shared a strategic vision for Olin College which included a focus on reducing inequity within and through engineering.

Programs of Study and Degree Requirements | 17 Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) (p. 24) Enginee ring (p. 25 ) Mechanical Engineering (ME) (p. 31 ) 4+1 Bachelor of Science Degree with Wellesley College (p. 34) Babson/Olin/Welle sley Sustainability Certificate Program (p. 37 ) For Babson, Brandeis and Wellesley Students: Engineering Certificate Program (p. 37) Curriculum, Goals and Outcomes Overview Our curriculum is based on the idea that engineering starts with people - understanding who we're designing for, what they value, and where opportunities to create value exist - and ends with people - appreciating the social context of our work and making a positive difference in the world. At Olin, students learn how to envision positive change and also how to realize and deliver that change. Olin was founded to challenge the models and assumptions of undergraduate engineering education. The traditional curriculum teaches students how to solve problems, but not how to find the right problems to solve, nor how to get their solutions out of the lab and into the world. At most schools, students spend their first semesters - sometimes years - taking prerequisites in math and science before they do any engineering. These programs discourage many of the students most interested in engineering, people who might have become transformative engineers if they had the chance. At Olin, students start engineering right away, with three classes in the first semester that provide hands -on experiences in several areas of engineering. Throughout the curriculum, students stay engaged by working on projects connected to real -world challenges. Olin's integrated curriculum depends upon math and science courses to help students characterize and understand our world and to develop scientific and quantitative analysis tools that facilitate problem solving. Students also begin to explore the arts, humanities, and social sciences and entrepreneurship in their first year, and directly integrate and apply this learning in all areas of the curriculum. Every student completes an Arts, Humanities and Social Scie nce (AHS) foundation course in their first semester in order to build strong skills in communication and contextual awareness, and continues to develop these skills through self -designed AHS study that might include an AHS concentration and capstone experience. Olin students also take an introductory entrepreneurship course in their first year, where they begin to develop an entrepreneurial mindset and learn the tools that are essential to realizing true and sustainable positive change. By their senior year, students are ready to solve real problems for companies and communities through engineering capstone experiences (SCOPE and Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship) that draw upon their prior curricular work. The academic culture at Olin is collaborative. Many of our classes are taught in a studio environment where students have dedicated space, and all classes emphasize classroom activity (not just listening) and cooperative exploration. Students have flexibility to choose projects that align with their interests; faculty act as co aches, mentors and advisors, providing just -in-time instruction and helping student teams find the resources they need. The curriculum is interdisciplinary. Students in all majors take a common set of classes that connect areas of engineering and integrate math, science, humanities, and social science. In keeping with this interdisciplinary approach, Olin faculty work and teach together. The faculty are organized as a single department that brings together engineers, scientists, mathematicians, arts and hu manities faculty, designers, entrepreneurs, and social scientists. Programs of Study and Degree Requirements 18| Olin College of Engineering Catalog 2021 -22 Olin's collaborative culture actively involves its students as partners in the creation and ongoing development of the curriculum. Students serve on nearly all curricular and policy development committees; offer frequent feedback that helps faculty shape current and future courses; and exercise autonomy in their own education by selecting project goals, topics, and methods. Program goals Olin's academic programs are des igned to support the institutional mission of preparing students to become engineering innovators. From a content perspective, the curricular emphases on engineering, analysis, design, and entrepreneurship are specifically aligned with the mission; through these experiences, students acquire facility in identifying needs, generating concepts that are responsive to people's needs, turning those concepts into technically realizable solutions, and marshaling the resources necessary to turn a vision into reality. The general education requirements support the graduation of liberally educated individuals who consider the ethical consequences of their work and create paradigms in which they can use their engineering education to effect positive change. After gradu ation, Olin students in the Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering and Mechanical Engineering programs will demonstrate attainment of the following objectives: Graduates strengthen the teams and communities they are part of by cultivating col laboration, effective communication and leadership. Graduates apply a multi -disciplinary engineering approach to solving important technical and societal challenges. Graduates create value for society through entrepreneurial and design thinking that transforms needs and opportunities into systems, products and solutions. Graduates adaptively and independently extend their learning to excel in fields about which they are passionate. Learning outcomes Olin College of Engineering is committed to preparing graduates who recognize the complexity of the world, appreciate the relationship of their work to individuals, to society, and to sustainability, expect to work in diverse and inclusive environ ments, and are ready to engineer a better future for the world. What follows are the learning outcomes Olin intends to instill in graduates and represents a vision of the key abilities, skills, and mindsets necessary for success, both in the engineering f ield and beyond. The vision has been constructed through careful research and consideration into engineering practice and competencies necessary to approach emerging technical, environmental, and societal challenges in a global context. Through intentional education al design, the Olin community supports the development of graduates who: Programs of Study and Degree Requirements | 19 Develop and Apply Knowledge, Skills, Approaches and Methods Students build the appropriate breadth and depth of content, techniques, and methodologies from diverse fields in order t o systematically and appropriately design experiments, gather data, model, analyze, and/or draw conclusions. Think Critically Students engage in analyzing, evaluating, synthesizing, and applying diverse information and experiences to support decision -maki ng, attitude formation, action, and expression. Develop and Apply Creativity Students generate novel ideas and approaches, taking into account authentic constraints, that lead to innovative outcomes. Prioritize Doing Good in the World Students use a holistic approach that integrates diverse backgrounds, perspectives, ethics, beliefs, and values, and considers the individual, social, and environmental impacts of their decisions to produce positive transformations while minimizing unintended consequences. Develop and Apply Self -Directed Learning Abilities Students diagnose learning needs, set learning goals, identify learning resources, select and implement learning strategies, and self -evaluate and reflect on learning outcomes. Collaborate Successfully Students create and maintain successful working relationships, maintain accountability for contributions, and identify and resolve interpersonal teaming conflicts to achieve a common goal. Design and Implement Processes to Achieve Desired Outcomes Students scope, plan, and implement projects, continuously evaluate progress, navigate uncertainty and adversity, and iterate as needed. Communicate Effectively Students express meaning successfully through oral, written, and visual media and listen actively to comprehend the meaning of others. Develop Personal and Professional Identity Students actively reflect on their backgrounds and experiences and integrate them into their evolving sense of self. In keeping with Olin's institutional value of continuous improvement, these learning outcomes are fluid, and they are assessed on a yearly cycle. Graduation Requirements All students must complete a minimum of 120 credits, and must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 in order to graduate from Olin. Students must satisfy two classifications of requirements to graduate from Olin: General Requirements and Program- Specific Requirements. General requirements must be satisfied by all students regardless of degree or concentration. Program- Specific Requirements vary depending on the degree being sought (ECE, ME or E) and, for the E degree, on the chosen concentration. General Requirements and Program -Specific Requirements are further broken down into Distribution Requirements and Course Requirements, both of which must be satisfied. Distribution Requirements specify the minimum total number of credits that must be completed in each of five broad areas (Engineering, Math, Science, AHS and Entrepreneurship). Course requirements specify which courses must be completed. Some course requirements can be satisfied only by completing a particular course. Other course requirement s allow more choice. Some courses may be used to satisfy one of several course requirements, but students must choose only a single requirement to be satisfied by each course. 20| Olin College of Engineering Catalog 2021 -22 A course completion can satisfy only one course requirement. General Distributio n and Course Requirements The required minimum of 120 credits must be appropriately distributed among five areas of study. The table below gives the minimum credits required in each area. Area Minimum Cr edits Required Engineering 46 Math and Science 30; of which at least 10 must be Math AHS and Entrepreneurship 28; of which at least 12 must be AHS A credit corresponds to an average of three hours of student work each week throughout an academic semest er. Therefore, a four-credit course (the most common course size at Olin) generally requires students to spend 12 hours each week attending classes, completing homework, participating in laboratory activities, and fulfilling all other course responsibilities. The course catalog lists, for each course, the number of credits earned and their area. Most courses provide credit in only o ne area. Some courses distribute their credits across more than one area. Students must register for at least 12 credits but no more than 20 credits each semester. Students typically register for 16 credits per semester. First year students are limited to 18 credits in the first semester. Some activities, like Passionate Pursuits and a few classes, provide non- degree credit, which appears on the transcript, but do not count toward minimum credit requirements. Non- degree credit counts toward the maximum credits per semester, but not toward the minimum. General Course Requirements All Olin students, regardless of degree or concentration, must satisfy the following course requirements. Students are strongly encouraged to complete all required 1000 level courses prior to the start of their junior year. Note: some courses are required to be taken during a specific semester/year of stud y while others are suggested. Designated alternatives are identified in the registration materials as course numbers ending in 88 or 88A. A designated alternative may also be part of a Curriculum Innovation Experiment or Prototype (CIE) and described in a CIE#### course description. Modeling Foundation MTH1111 Modeling and Simulation of the Physical World 2 MTH SCI1111 Modeling and Simulation of the Physical World 2 SCI Mathematics Foundation Foundational mathematics content in the following areas is required of all students: linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, multivariable calculus, and probability and statistics. The interdisciplinary three course sequence titled Quantitative E ngineering Analysis delivers the content areas of linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, and multivariable calculus, along with the physics foundation requirement. Each course in the sequence blends mathematical content, physics content and engineering content and as such, the full sequence must be completed in order to satisfy these content requirements. Each course builds on content from the previous and thus successful completion is a prerequisite to move on in the sequence. In the event that the sequence cannot be completed, the following minimum content guide will provide alternative direction for the remaining content areas. Keep in mind that the interdisciplinary courses are designed to build upon mathematical, scienc e and engineering concepts in a sequential manner and must be taken in order.

AHS Concentration OR Entrepreneurship Concentration Subtotal: 12 24| Olin College of Engineering Catalog 2021 -22 AHS concentration: 12 credits of an AHS discipline may be either: 1) a combination of 8 credits of course work and an AHS Capstone Project, AHSE4190, or 2) a 12- credit sequence of AHS courses without a project. Entrepreneurship concentration: For the Entrepreneurship concentration, students complete a 12- credit sequence of Entrepreneurship courses. This includes at least 4 credits of Entrepreneurial Project course work in AHSE2515, Iterate, or in AHSE3515, Launch. The Entrepreneurship concentration is customized by the student and may be a 12 credit combination of Iterate, Launch and other approved courses, where both Iterate and Launch can be taken multiple times for credit with each counting toward the concentration. SAMPLE entrepreneurship concentrations: AHSE2515 Iterate (2 credits) taken six times AHSE3515 Launch (4 credits) taken three times AHSE2515 Iterate (2 credits) taken four times and AHSE3515 Launch (4 credits) taken one time AHSE2515 Iterate (2 credits) taken two times and two oth er Entrepreneurship courses taken (4 credits each) AHSE3515 Launch (4 credits) taken one time and two other Entrepreneurship courses taken (4 credits each) AHSE2515 Iterate (2 credits) taken four times and AHSE3515 Launch (4 credits) taken 1 time AHSE2515 Iterate (2 credits) taken four times and AHSE3515 Launch (4 credits) taken 1 time Approved entrepreneurship courses include: any upper -level Entrepreneurship course at Olin a subset of approved courses from other Babson departments, by petition Academic Programs The curriculum is designed to provide technical depth in the areas most relevant to students' program of study. Every student learns abo ut software, electronics and mechanical systems, and every student works on interdisciplinary projects. Our degree programs are designed to complement common experiences with specialization and technical depth. Olin offers ABET accredited degrees in Electr ical and Computer Engineering (ECE) (p. 24 ), Mechanical Engineering (ME) (p. 31) and Engineering (E) (p. 25), a flexible degree program that lets students choose or create an area of concentration. Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) The ECE major provides advanced opportunities for students to analyze, design, and build computing and communication systems. Students apply the principles of linear systems, circuit theory, microelectronics, computer architecture, communication theory, software engineering and signal processing to understand and build these systems. The Course Requirements of the ECE program are: ECE - All of: ENGR2410 Signals and Systems 4 ENGR OR or designated alternative ENGR2420 Intro Microelectronic Circuits with laboratory 4 ENGR ENGR2510 Software Design 4 ENGR or approved substitutions ENGR3410 Computer Architecture 4 ENGR The designated alternative for ENGR2410 (p. 50), Signals and Systems is Engineering Systems Analysis and Engineering Systems Analysis: Signals.

Each student in the Engineering degree program designs a concentration that has depth, breadth, coherence, and rigor and also satisfies the Olin College graduation requirements. All paths to graduation with the Engineering degree provide for all outcomes required by the ABET General Criteria. Students submit a plan of study when they declare a major. The plan lists the courses the student intends to take to fulfill graduation requirements, and demonstrates that these courses (along with additional required courses) constitute a major in engineering that has depth, breadth, coherence, and rigor. A set of predefined concentrations in Bioengineering, Computing, Design, and Robotics are provided below. Students may design their plan of study using one of these predefined concentrations or may create a new concentration that addresses thei r own interests. Students may choose a name for their self -designed concentration. This concentration name appears on the diploma but not on the official transcript. The plan of study must be signed by the student's advisor and two faculty members whose area of expertise is relevant to the proposed area of study (if the advisor's area is relevant, the advisor can count as one of the two). Plans of study are reviewed by faculty from the Curriculum Working Group. This group is responsible for checking the following criteria: Do the proposed courses constitute a major in Engineering that has breadth, depth, coherence and rigor? Do the faculty who approved the plan have relevant expertise? Should other faculty be consulted? Is the plan feasible based on a reasonable forecas t of course offerings? The availability of faculty and other resources determines which classes are offered and their schedule, which may limit a student's ability to complete a particular concentration. Is the plan comparable to the sample concentration s and previous student -designed concentrations? If a student -designed concentration is named, is the proposed name accurate and appropriate? 26| Olin College of Engineering Catalog 2021 -22 All course plans go through the same review process whether they are modeled after one of the sample concentrations or self - designed. The plan of study is provisional. If approved and completed, a student may use it to graduate. Minor substitutions may be made with advisor approval ; s ubstantive changes require approval of the Curriculum Working Group. Engineering: Bioengineering (E:Bio) Bioengineering (also called Biomedical Engineering) is a broad field. As such, the concentration is meant to be an interdisciplinary one, rooted in engineering problem solving and a deep understanding of biology. Bioengineering subspecia lties include areas such as medical devices, biomechanics, assistive technology, bioinformatics, cell and tissue engineering, neurotechnology, computational biology, drug delivery, medical imaging, and many more. The Engineering major with a concentration in Bioengineering (E:Bio) prepares students to approach problems important to biology, medical research, and clinical studies, regardless of the subspecialty they choose to pursue. Note that some students interested in Bioengineering will take Bioengineering- relevant courses while pursuing another concentration (i.e. Mechanical Engineering, Computing, or Electrical and Computer Engineering). Students wishing to pursue the E:Bio concentration should develop a program of study in consultation with bioengineer ing faculty. As Bioengineering encompasses many subspecialties, students develop a course plan that supports their area of study. E:Bio course plans may include classes at Babson, Brandeis, Wellesley, or other institutions. Some of the courses that may be included in an E:Bio course plan are listed below. Students must take at least 4 credits of advanced Math and advanced Biology in addition to at least 16 credits of relevant Bioengineering courses. E:Bio Bioengineering Sixteen credits of coursework appropriate to the Bioengineering program of study form the core of a BioE focus. These courses may have the designation of 36xx (the Bioengineering prefix) but do not need to do so. They do not all need to be ENGR courses; however all students do have to meet the minimum number of engineering credits required for graduation. Relevant SCI (advanced Biology, relevant Physics, Chemistry), Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Computing courses that build relevant sk ills can be used for certain Bioengineering subspecialties. Example courses include, but are not limited to: (note: courses not hyperlinked are offered at Wellesley College) ENGR2330 Introduction to Mechanical Prototyping 4 ENGR ENGR2510 Software Design 4 ENGR ENGR3232 Biomedical Device Design 4 ENGR ENGR3260 Design for Manufacturing 4 ENGR ENGR3520 Foundations of Computer Science 4 ENGR ENGR3610 4 ENGR ENGR3650 Structural Biomaterials 4 Special Topics in Bioengineering Variable Credits ENGR3635 Neurotechnology, Brains and Machines 2 ENGR MTH2135 Neurotechnology, Machines 2 MTH SCI CS313 Computational Biology 4 ENGR E:Bio Advanced Biology Four credits of advanced Biology appropriate to the program of study, examples include, but are not limited to: (note: courses not hyperlinked are offered at Wellesley College) SCI2210 Immunology 4 SCI Programs of Study and Degree Requirements | 27 SCI2214 Microbial Diversity 4 SCI SCI2215 Emerging Technologies in Cancer Research, Diagnosis and Treatment w/ Laboratory 4 SCI SCI2299 Special Topics in Biological Sciences Variable Credits SCI BISC203 Comparative Physiology and Anatomy of Vertebrates with Laboratory 4 SCI SCI2299 Special Topics in Biological Sciences offerings may be used as advanced biology by petition only (often the registration materials will specify if it will satisfy; otherwise students should petition to have it count via their plan of study).

The E: Design concentration prepares students to address important societal and environmental needs through design thinking. E:Design students work closely with the design faculty at Olin to define individually customized programs of studies that mee t Olin credit requirements. It remains the student's responsibility to ensure that their program of study also meets the requirements for graduate programs or professional practice. Courses used by a student to meet the Design General Requirements, such as the Design Depth requirement, may not simultaneously be used to meet the E:Design or E:Design Electives requirements. E:Design Elective courses may be drawn from any area including AHSE, Engineering, Science, or Math. Students are strongly recommended to consider one or more AHSE courses to meet this requirement. Design Research may be accomplished through an Independent study course advised by design faculty. Design Research may count toward the E:Design requirement with approval by design faculty. E:Design courses may be drawn from cross registration or study away institutions with prior approval by design faculty. Note that courses at design schools will often meet the E:Design Electives requirement and not the E:Design requirement. All E:Design programs of study should be consistent with the student's educational goals and must contain sufficient depth, breadth, coherence, and rigor. All programs of study must receive prior approval by design faculty. All E:Design programs of study must fulfill the General Graduation Requirements. E:Design Eight credits of approved Intermediate or Advanced Design courses ; f our credits may be met by Design Research E:Design Electives Sixteen credits of approved coursework appropriate to the program of study Engineering: Robotics (E:Robo) Robotics is a multi- disciplinary field. A s tudent may have a passion for the software, sensing, mechanics, controls or integration aspects of robotics. All of these are equally a part of the field of Robotics. Olin's Robotics concentration deal s with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots and computer systems including actuation, control, sensory feedback and information processing, integrating significant technology from multiple disciplines, with a focus on the fusion of electrical, software, and mechanical engineering. Students wishing to pursue the E:Robo concentration within the Engineering major must develop a specific program of study in consultation with robotics faculty members. In addition, a plan of study should contain both a statement of goals - including an expla nation of focus area - and enough course material to support these goals. Robotics faculty members are available to help develop appropriate course selections.

Sustainability is an inherently transdisciplinary field, drawing on engineering and science as well as social sciences, humanities, business, and the arts for various aspects of sustainability practice. E:Sust students work closely with sustainability faculty at Olin to define individually customized programs of studies that meet Olin credit requirements. It remains the student's responsibility to ensure that their program of study also meets the requirements for graduate programs or professional practice. Cours es used by a student to meet the General Requirements may not simultaneously be used to meet the E:Sust concentration- specific requirements. E:Sust courses may be drawn from cross -registration or study away institutions with approval by the CSTB, in consultation with sustainability faculty. As with all Engineering programs of study, E:Sust programs of study should be consistent with the student's educational goals and must contain sufficient depth, breadth, and coherence. All programs of study must receive approval by the ARB, in consultation with sustainability faculty. All E:Sust programs of study must fulfill the General Graduation Requirements. E:Sustainability Requirements Overview E:Sust programs of study require a four -credit introductory sustainability course, four credits of advanced sustainability coursework, and sixteen credits of approved elective coursework. Sustainability coursework is defined for the purposes of this concentration as having a substantial component of sustainabili ty theory and/or methods, or as having a substantial component addressing one or more of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). 30| Olin College of Engineering Catalog 2021 -22 E:Sust Introductory Introduction to Sustainability or a designated or approved alternative. Introductory courses will be developed on a regular basis and will be noted in the registration materials as acceptable. SUST2201 Introduction to Sustainability 2 AHSE; 2 ENGR E:Sust Electives Sixteen credits of approved elective coursework should support the depth, breadth, and coherence of the plan of study; we recommend including four credits of social sciences or humanities along with physical or life sciences or engineering. Electi ves can i nclude courses that are not primarily centered on sustainability that nevertheless support the student's learning goals in sustainability. E:Sust elective courses may be drawn from any area including Arts, Humanities, Social Science and Entrepreneurship, E ngineering, Science, or Math, and may include up to four credits of research with a sustainability faculty member as the research advisor or disciplinary advisor. Courses counted as E:Sust electives cannot be double -counted for other graduation requirement s.

Students typically study away in their junior year, so they usually make plans and apply during their sophomore year. For information about the planning and application process, see Study Away. In order to transfer credits from another institution, students follow procedures described in the academic policy section on Transfer Credit. Financial assistance may be available to eligible students. Contact the Financial Aid Office for additional information regar ding eligibility and procedures. Independent study and research Olin offers many opportunities to engage in independent study and research activities. Independent Study activities give students an opportunity to explore academic topics of interest that are not available in regularly offered classes. Independ ent Study takes place during the semester. Research activities give students an opportunity to work with faculty on academic research projects, usually initiated by a faculty member. Research can take place both during the academic year and during t he summer, th ough summer research is only available for pay, not credit. Olin offers two forms of Independent Study or Research activity: 1. An ISR is an Independent Study or Research activity graded on a pass/no credit scale. An ISR cannot be used to satisfy a course requirement (which includes courses used as part of an AHS, Entrepreneurship, Certificate program or Engineering concentration). ISR activities are associated with the following course numbers, based on discipline, or as a generic listing of ISR: AHSE0 177, AHSE0577, ENGR0077, MTH0077, SCI0077. Programs Requireme nts| 33 2. An ISR -G is an Independent Study or Research activity taken for a letter grade. An ISR -G might be used to satisfy a course requirement, pending approval, which approval must be specifically requested. Graded ISR-G activities are associated with the following course numbers, based on discipline, or as a generic listing of ISR: per semester for each ISR or ISR -G activity and cannot receive pay for activities which receive credit in the same semester. Students will be productively engaged with an ISR or ISR -G activity for approximately 3 hours per week per credit. There is no limit on the total number of credits o f ISR or ISR -G a student can earn while at Olin. ISR/ISR -G credit is academic credit that counts toward the overall 120 credit requirement. ISR/ISR -G credit may be applied toward credit requirements in Math, Science, AHS, Entrepreneurship, or Engineering, subject to approval by the faculty advisor if the advisor has relevant expertise, or by an additional disciplinary advisor otherwise. Students must submit a proposal prior to the start of an ISR or ISR -G. The ISR/ISR -G proposal form is located on the forms page under the Registrar's Office. Proposals are reviewed by the Registrar's Office and may be referred to the Curriculum Committee; a proposal might be rejected or returned for revision if it violates policies or guidelines. Student led courses Student Led Courses (SLCs) embody Olin's emphasis on team teaching and student -directed learning by enabling two or more students to work with Olin faculty as student teachers of a Special Topics course. These student teachers design and deliver their course to other students who receive up to four academic credits and a pass/no credit, EG, or ABCDF grade at the instructors' discretion. SLCs may not duplicate existing course offerings. SLCs might fulfill credit or course requireme nts depending on the topic and grading method. All SLCs are overseen by faculty advisors who serve as instructors of record. The supervising Olin faculty members assign final grades and serve as points of contact for all students taking the course, in order to address concerns or questions. The student teachers receive guidance from the faculty advisors, and also receive Independent Study (ISR -G) credit in recognition of the pedagogical experience that they gain through this teaching experience. Student teachers and faculty advisors need to submit a proposal and follow additional guidelines prior to offering a SLC. The proposal form and guidelines are available at the Registrar's page. Passionate pursuits A Passionate Pursui t is an intellectual or scholarly activity in which students propose a semester -long project, solicit faculty participation, and establish objectives. Students wishing to enroll in a Passionate Pursuit fill out a proposal form that indicates a title and d escription of the project, faculty sponsor, learning goals, and list of deliverables (often a presentation or performance) that constitute satisfactory completion of the project. Successfully completed Passionate Pursuit projects earn non -degree credit, an d the title of the project appears on the student's transcript. Grand Challenges Scholars Program Olin's Grand Challenges Scholars Program (GCSP) helps students leverage their educational experiences and participation in the Olin community to galvanize lifelong learning and community participation. The focus of the program is on developing the self (\"I\"), developing Olin (\"we\"), and developing the world (\"all of us\"). The program culminates with the creation of each student's personal vision and mission snapshot, reflecting their identity, values, experiences, and goals to date. Olin's GCS P uses a combination of formal courses and informal experiences to help students grow into their identities, participate in a comm unity of practice, and find a role for themselves in fulfilling Olin's mission of doing good in the world. 34| Olin College of Engineering Catalog 2021 -22 4+1 Bachelor of Science Degree with Wellesley College The Olin 4+1 Program offers Wellesley College students an opportunity to obtain a second bachelor's degree in engineering by completing a fifth year of study at Olin. Students enrolled in the 4+1 program begin their engineering study while enrolled a t Wellesley; by the time they complete their Wellesley degree, 4+1 students must have completed all math and science prerequisites as well as five foundation courses, listed below. In their fifth year, 4+1 students enroll at Olin and spend bo th semesters in residence, completing major requirements as well as the engineering capstone. The Engineering Certificate is not intended to serve as a pathway to the 4+1 Program. While there are some overlapping requirements between these two programs, the 4+1 Program requires an extensive set of course and credit requirements not only in engineering, but also in math and science. Students intending to apply for admission to the 4+1 Program will need to plan their schedules carefully and often take courses at different times compared to Engineering Certifica te students. Admission to the 4+1 program takes place in the student's junior year at Wellesley. Students admitted to the 4+1 program receive the Olin Tuition Scholarship for their year as Olin students, and may apply for additional need- based financial ai d. Wellesley students who are admitted to the 4+1 Program must spend two full -time semesters in residence at Olin (living on campus). 4+1 Degree Requirements All students wishing to complete the 4+1 program must fully satisfy Wellesley's degree requirements prior to matriculating at Olin, and must also satisfy specific science, math and engineering requirements.

Programs of Study and Degree Requirements | 37 Babson/Olin/Wellesley Sustainability Certificate Program Admission to the Babson/Olin/Wellesley Sustainability Certificate Program concluded in spring 2020. Since its launch in Fall 2011, the Babson- Olin-Wellesley Sustainability Certificate program has offered the opportunity to engage in cross -disciplinary learning across campus cultures through collaborative curricular experiences and project -based courses. Faculty and staff have worked together to create a community passionate about teaching and practicing sustainability. In the past decade, the landscape has also changed. Wellesley has continued to grow its Environmental Studies department, Babson has introduced a Sustainability concentration, and increasing numbers of Olin students complete self- designed majors in sustainability. As the number of students, faculty, and staff who are actively engaged in sustainability work grows on all three campuses, the opportunities to get involved and to study the field have multiplied. At the same time, we have learned a great deal about what works best to teach, inspire, and connect across the three campuses from running the Certificate program. Therefo re, in partnership across BOW, we have made the difficult decision to conclude our Sustainability Certificate program. We increasingly find that our aspirations are outgrowing the structures we put in place ten years ago and we want to make space for new c ollaborations to emerge. We have a great deal of learning and success on which to build, and we look forward to seeing what new efforts might arise. This program was administered through the Babson/Olin/Wellesley Three College Collaboration. For students e nrolled prior to Fall 2020, details on how to complete the certificate requirements can be found on the Three College Collaboration website. The Sustainability Certificate is awarded to Olin students upon completion of their Olin degree. For Babson, Brandeis and Wellesley Students: Engineering Certificate Program Olin offers a Certificate in Engineering Studies for students at Wellesley College, Babson College, and Brandeis University who wish to gain a foundation in engineering content, skills, and perspectives, as well as some depth in one engineering fiel d. The structure of this certificate gives students the flexibility to create course plans that meet their interests and needs. To earn a certificate, the student must complete five Olin courses (four credits each) that must be taken for a letter or \"EG \" grade. E ach student proposes their own set of five courses, which must satisfy the requirements below, and must be approved by Olin faculty. Engineering Certificate Program Goals and Requirements Olin's engineering certificate program has four overarching goals: 1. Provide a foundation to engineering concepts and practices. This goal is normally achieved by completing one foundation course from the list below. 2. Explore the depth of an engineering subject, field, or topic. This goal is achieved by proposing and completing a set of three depth courses as described below. 3. Experience Olin's broader approach to engineering , which includes projects, teamwork, user -centered design work, and interdisciplinary integration. 4. Choose a set of classes that achieve a reasonable degree of coherence. This goal is achieved if the student can articulate how the courses build upon each other and collectively achieve an outcome that is important to the student. Foundation course Choose one of, totaling a minimum of 4 credits ENGR 1125 Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation and Measurement 4 ENGR ENGR1200 Design Nature 4 ENGR ENGR2250 Collaborative Design 4 ENGR MTH1111 Modeling and Simulation of the Physical World 2 MTH AND SCI1111 Modeling and Simulation of the Physical World 2 SCI standard fall offerings: ENGR1125, ENGR1200*, MTH1111 and SCI1111 38| 2021 -22 standard spring offering: ENGR2250 Depth courses (three courses, for 12 credits) Each Engineering Certificate student proposes a set of three depth courses (12 credits total) that relate to a common theme (for example, design, mechanical engineering, human computer interaction). These courses must receive engineering (ENGR) credit. Students can include one or more foundation courses, listed above, as depth courses. However, if a course is used to satisfy the foundation requirement, it cannot also be used as a depth course. Elective (one course, for four credits) Each student chooses a fifth course that is meaningful to them, and develops the depth or coherence of their plan. Prerequisites and Expectations Most Olin College engineering courses have general math and science prerequisites that are typically taken at the student's home institution, and students should check with instructors prior to registration to verify their readiness for each course. In addition, Olin courses often have significant project components and require considerable team based work. Non -Olin students should be prepared to work closely with their Olin counterparts, both inside and outside class. Credit for Courses Taken at Home Institution A maximum of one course from a student's home institution may substitute for an Olin course, provided it covers equivalent material. This substitution has no bearing on whether or not it is used to satisfy other requirements at the home institution. A student should petition for this course substitution early in their program by contacting the Olin College Registrar. Wellesley College students may elect to transfer ENGR 160 from Wellesley to satisfy Olin's ENGR1200, Design Nature. Babson College students enrolling in EPS4515 at Babson may count their home course of Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship towards the Certifica te without petition. Enrollment and Completion of the Engineering Certificate Program Students who wish to enroll in the Engineering Certificate Program must submit a Certificate Program Enrollment Form to the Olin Registrar's Office after they have completed their first course at Olin and before taking additional courses. The form must be signed by the student's advisor at their home institution, as well as the Olin certificate advisor. After th e proposed plan is approved, any subsequent changes must be approved by the Olin certificate advisor. A certificate can only be awarded if the student has completed an approved plan. Note Regarding the 4+1 Program with Wellesley College The Engineering Certificate is not intended to serve as a pathway to the 4+1 Program. While there are some overlapping requirements between these two programs, the 4+1 Program requires an extensive set of course and credit requirements not only in engineering, but also in math and science. Wellesley students in the Engineering Certificate Program intending to apply for the 4+1 Program should review the requirements and suggested course plans for both programs carefully to ensure they have completed all the necessary requirements for the year in residence at Olin. Courses, Credits, Hours | 39 Availability of Offerings Information in this catalog and semester offerings are subject to change. Please go to the Registrar's webpage or the live semester course browser for up -to-date information including faculty teaching assignments. For more information about a specific course, talk to the course instructor listed in the current or previous registration booklets. Prerequisites and co-requisites may occasionally be waived with permission of the course instructor. Course Numbering Nomenclature Course numbers are composed of an alphabetic prefix and a numeric suffix. The alphabetic prefix indicates the primary area of the course, according to the following table. Note that some course s earn credit for multiple areas (see Course Listings Table below). Alphabetic Prefix Primary Area AHSE AHS/Entrepreneurship ENGR Engineering MTH Mathematics SCI Science SUST Sustainability The first digit of the numeric suffix indicates the nominal level of a course according to the following table. Numeric Suffix Level 0XXX Any 1XXX Introductory 2XXX Intermediate 3XXX Advanced 4XXX Summative/Capstone Hours/Week Nomenclature The definition of a credit hour at Olin, is 1 credit is equal to 3 hrs of work per week. Olin's standard calendar is 15 weeks . To better allow teaching staff, facilities schedulers, and students to manage the time requirements of e very course, the number of expected hours per week is indicated by a triplet of numbers, as follows: (Contact) - (Non -Contact) - (Preparation) Contact: The first number indicates approximately the number of hours per week teaching staff and students will spend together in scheduled school facilities. Non-Contact: The second number indicates approximately the number of hours students will spend each week working on their own in scheduled school facilities. Preparation: The third number indicates approximately the number of hours per week a well -prepared student with good study habits should expect to spend studying and completing homework, reading assignments, projects, etc. For example, the AHSE 1100 History of Technology: A Cultural and Contextual Approach course is described as a 4-0- 8 course, so students in the course can expect to spend four hours in class with an instructor, and approximately eight hours outside of class completing course -related assignments.

Dedicated to orchestral performance in the concerted spirit of chamber music, the orchestra forges individual participation, active listening,and group- motivatio n into performances that have established it as the only conductorless orchestra of its kind at an American college. (A student can apply up to 4 OCO credits to the 28 required credi ts in AHSE, or can petition to apply up to 4 OCO credits to the AHS concentration. Any additional credits, i.e., more than 4, earned by a student enrolling in OCO will show up as additional AHS credits, but will not count toward satisfying the requisi te 28 credits in AHSE.) Credits: 1 AHSE. Recommended Requisites Audition. Hours : 2-0-1. AHSE1100 History of Technology: A Cultural & Contextual Approach Throughout the semester we will investigate different history of technology narratives by employing a variety of analytical frameworks. Our narrative case studies range from bronze age societal studies to cutting edge AI and sustainability technologies, and throughout the semester we will compare and contrast these narratives in search of larger insights. We will identify and employ analytical frameworks such as large technological systems; paradigms and scientific revolutions; technologies and political values; ethical theories; and the environmental and sustainability implications of technologies. Throughout the semester we will engage these narratives and frameworks through targete d writing activities, debates, individual and group presentations, readings and videos, and in- class discussions. Students will have a high degree of autonomy, and will set and evaluate their own learning objectives, determine the topic for their final projects, and design and facilitate in -class activities throughout the semester. Credits: 4 AHSE. Hours: 4 -0-8. Courses, Credits, Hours | 41 AHSE1122 The Wired Ensemble - Instruments, Voices, Players Three concurrent streams comprise The Wired Ensemble: 1) composition and performance of original works for instruments and voices; 2) development of a \"Composer's Tool Chest\"; and 3) musical analysis and reflection. As composers and performers, students concentrate on instruments, voices, and the symbolic language that brings them to life. They compose music for every family of instruments (woodwinds, brass, strings, percussion), as well as voice and spoken word. The course features biweekly performances of original compositions. Students also have the opportunity to hear their works performed in concert settings by professional and peer musicians with whom they have collaborated. Seminar trips to Boston and New York enable the class to gather musical and inspirational material, in addition to hearing some of the finest orchestral and vocal ensembles in concert. While actively engaged in composition and performance - all geared to an end -of-term production - students examine the worlds of earlier composers in order to provide context for their own lives and work. Credits: 4 AHSE. Recommended Requisites Ability to read music. Hours: 4 -0-8. AHSE1135 The Digital Eye: Photography, Vision, and Visual Communication This course is all about developing a creative voice in the visual arts using digital photography as the medium of choice. The Digital Eye is a hands -on course taught in studio mode and it is project -based with weekly homework assignments that also includes several major projects allowing longer -term project engagement. Digital single -lens reflex (DSLR) cameras, digital editing tools and printing capabilities are provided and gaining technical facility with these tools is an important goal. As this is an AHS foundation course, students will also have an opportunity to further develop written communication skills and critical thinking ability. We will consider the many interpretations of art and the visual communication of ideas. The work of contemporary fine art photographers will be studied in depth and trips to museum and gallery exhibits will be scheduled as appropriate as will field trips with the class to capture images in interesting locations. Students with no prior experience with photography are strongly encouraged to enroll in this course and are as welcome as those who have already discovered a passion for creative expression using photography. Credits: 4 AHSE. Hours: 4 -0-8. AHSE1145 The Human Connection: Tools and Concepts from Anthropology for Understanding Today's World The book Wired to Care opens with the story of a designer who disguised herself as an elderly person to better understand the experiences of the elderly in our society. Author Dev Patnaik explains his interest in this experiment. It comes down to empathy: All of this is to reclaim a very old idea, that quantitative data and facts are no substitute for real- world experience and human connection. Anthropologists have long argued for the importance of putting oneself in other people shoes for better understanding. The anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski wrote in 1922 that the goal of the anthropologist is \"to grasp the native's point of view, his relation to life, to realize his vision of his world.\" In this course, students will try out the anthropological methods of participation, observation, interviews, and analysis of cultural materials and texts. This is a ha nds- on course for students who want to get out and meet people all with the aim of greater understanding. The course focuses on three thematic topics important to our society in the twenty -first century. Past offerings have focused on aging, religion, health, and globalization. The class includes assignments, events, and interactions that will take students off campus (perhaps to the Needham Senior Center, local coffee shops, and to Boston's ethnic neighborhoods) and will include visitors from area institutio ns. Credits: 4 AHSE. Hours: 4 -0-8. AHSE1148 Dirt to Shirt: Global Garments in Context This course is an intensive study of the global supply chain for clothing. It examines social, economic, political, environme ntal, and technological issues all along the supply chain. This includes historical and contemporary production of components such as cotton, wool, and Kevlar; textile processing and garment production; and the after -life of the clothes we dispose of. The class will include readings, discussions, and engagement with multimedia sources; first -person contact with local people involved in the industry; and student projects on a chosen node of the supply chain. The course is multidisciplinary, but centered in cul tural anthropology. In anthropology, empathy is a means to understanding, and a central premise of the course is the need to develop empathy. This class takes an empathetic approach to people and activities all along the global garments supply chain. Credits: 4 AHSE. 42| Olin College of Engineering Catalog 2021 -22 AHSE1150 What is \"I\"? This interdisciplinary exploration of identity draws on a diverse range of genres in the Humanities, Social Sciences, Arts and Sciences. Prior offerings have drawn from Anthropology, Artificial Intelligence, Biology, Film, History, Literature, Memoir, Neuroscience, Philosophy, Psychology, Political Science, Science Fiction, Sociology, and Visual Arts. Our goal is to understand how individual perspective (or the illusion of same) comes into being and how our own unique perspectives shape the way that we see the w orld. Emphasis is placed on communication and context. This course focuses more on philosophy and artificial intelligence while AHSE 1155: Identity from the Mind and the Brain is more focused on the science of psychology and neuroscience. Credits: 4 AHSE. Hours: 4-0- 8. AHSE1155 Identity from the Mind & the Brain: Who Am I and How Do I Know Perhaps the most fundamental question any developing individual asks himself/herself is: Who am I? The ways we answer this question have evolved over the course of history as the dominant ways of knowing (epistemologies) have shifted. Indeed, the question of how we come to know ourselves has captivated Western scholars since the days of Descartes, but a look at the last fifty to sixty years has also seen enormous changes. Many people invoke psychological and philosophical perspectives in describing their identity, focusing on their personality, their developmental history, and their place in society. But the explosion of neurobiological research has introduced a new and viable outlook: explaining identity at the chemical and electrical level of the brain. There is good reason to think that these different perspectives on identity are mutually exclusive and this tension will underlie everything we discuss in this interdisciplinary course. Indeed, when it comes to a topic as fundamental to human existence as id entity, it is absolutely essential to wonder not only \"who am I?\" but to also ask \"how do I know?\" In this course, we will approach the question of identity from multiple perspectives, including psychology, postmodern philosophy, and neuroscience. In the p rocess, we will critically examine not only the conception of identity that each perspective supports, but also the assumptions and limitations of each epistemology. This course focuses more on the science of psychology and neuroscience, while AHSE 1150: What Is \"I\"? is more focused on philosophy and artificial intelligence. Credits: 4 AHSE. Hours: 4 -0-8. AHSE1160 Democracy and Media Every day, you have the opportunity to choose democracy. When we think of democracy, we usually think of a form of government: a representational democracy like the United States. But, the experience of participating in a representational democracy is not always democratic. Conversely, companies and colleges like Olin are not organized as democracies, and yet the people that work and study there have many opportunities to practice democracy. Democracy is something you, and those around you, can choose to create and practice. To achieve this, we must acknowledge that democracy is contextual and mediated. Dimensions such as gender , race, class, ideology, norms, economics, and institutional power all affect the political standing of citizens and issues. Media, too, have long shaped the experience of democracy: debate, writing, voting, and petitioning are ancient technologies. The design and use of contemporary information and communication technology dramatically shape how democracy plays out. This course will ask you to confront this tangle of interests, identity, technology, and power. We will ask ourselves the quintessential civic question: \"What should we do?\" and consider \"What is my role and responsibility as a citizen? as an engineer? as a member of the Olin community?\" You will explore ways to make the spaces you live and work in more democratic. You will practice using your voice and influence to make change through public narrative, collective action, and media. Credits: 4 AHSE. Hours: 4 -0-8.

Courses, Credits, Hours | 43 AHSE1515 Products and Markets In this foundational course on business and entrepreneurship, students engage with the concept of entrepreneurship as the pursuit of opportunity to create value for others. By working in teams to conceive and execute a series of entrepreneurial experiments, students in this course develop the skills necessary to design and test value propositions, assess and improve product -market fit, and create sustainable business models. The course places special emphasis on entrepreneurship as a way of doing good in the world, and invites students to approach all aspects of engineering with an entrepreneurial mindset. In addition, students are exposed to personal and interpersonal tools that enable high- performance teamwork, including project planning and peer feedback. These entrepreneurial experiences and their associated challenges provide a context in which students can develop broader self -awareness, productive self -reflection, and courage. Credits: 4 AHSE. Hours: 4 -0-8.

In this course, we will explore six books, selected from different times, societies, and genres, that have had an unquestionably major impact upon the world in which we live. Class meetings will integrate contextual studies of the historical context of each book (including the author's background, the pol itical and social setting, and other factors), careful analyses of the works themselves, and discussions of why they proved so influential. Our discussions will investigate each book's contemporary and modern impact while also exploring the qualities that caused all of our selections to have such an enduring and global effect. Students will be expected to contribute to class discussions, make presentations, and write a report on an additional book of their choosing. NOTE: this course lasts one half of the semester, will meet twice a week, and will require approximately 12 hours of student eff ort each week. Credits: 2 AHSE. Recommended Requisites AHS Foundation. Hours: 4-0- 8. AHSE2114 Science Fiction and Historical Context Science fiction is a wonderful genre that somehow captures a society's ideals, fears, assumptions, and major challenges. In the same way that a historian attempts to piece together complex cause -effect chains to make sense of the past, science fiction writers project the values, technologies, and beliefs of their own societies into alternate or future realities. Our class wil l work together to understand the conventions of science fiction and explore science fiction works (books, short stories, film) produced in different times, across various cultures, and in different sub- genres of this field. Students will have the opportunity to analyze different works of science fiction through writings and class discussions, and can also choose to develop a science fiction idea of their own.

Students will learn to visualize objects in three -dimensional space and commit them to the two -dimensional space of a sheet of paper. Students will draw subjects from life, i.e. stationa ry objects and life models using media including charcoal, graphite, conte, and ink. The emphasis will be realistic depiction as compared to non- objective abstraction. Students will begin with basic exercises in drawing and rapidly move to more complex intensive drawing experiences. Approximately one- third of the classroom time will be used for drawing from a life model. Class discussion and sketchbook homework assignments will be an essential element in the learning process. Homework assignments will include drawing and visual thinking exercises to be completed in personal sketchbooks. Reading selected text material is also part of the homework requirement. Invited speakers will contribute to the course and provide informal critiques of student work. At least one field trip is planned to a local art museum. Other in -class activities will include participation in discussion of drawings (old master, 19th century and contemporary) group critique sessions, and viewing documentary material. Assessment will be measured by improvement based on weekly homework assignments, classroom work, and three drawing projects to be completed outside of class. This can be fun, and you will surprise yourself with how well you can draw realistically by the e nd of the course. Credi ts: 4 AHSE. Hours: 4 -0-8. AHSE2141 Engineering for Humanity This course introduces students to engineering problem solving, beginning with understanding client needs and ending with implemented, adaptable, adoptable, and sustainable solutions. This course will draw equally on empathetic and ethnographic methods and on a technical understanding of the problem and solution domains. Over the semester, we will learn about and with our clients; we will identify specific challenges that our clients face; and together with our clients we will develop concrete solutions to address these challenges. Students will leave Engineering for Humanity with a grounded understanding o f the engineering problem solving process, experience in participant -observer fieldwork, and hopefully a feeling of satisfaction at having made a concrete difference in the lives of members of our community. The projects will be specific service projects that students identify and design while working with senior citizens in surrounding communit ies. For example, students might design a device to help someone who has difficulty reaching up to change a light bulb, something to help hold a newspaper steady with shaky hands, or something to enable someone to get clothes out of a clothing dryer that is difficult to stoop down to reach. Some sessions of the course will be devoted to co- design with the client population or to team meetings. Other sessions involving guest speakers and fieldtrips, others with course discussion of topi cs relevant to aging.

Courses, Credits, Hours | 45 AHSE2155 Constructing and Performing the Self In this course, theatrical and psychological approaches will be purposel y inter -mingled: the questions we will ask and the answers we will derive will be informed equally by each. You will see, on a daily basis, how each field informs, supports, and speaks to the other as you oscillate between the roles of scholar, writer, act or, and critic. While we will have some class sessions and assignments explicitly grounded in only one field to build your fluency speaking their languages, the major activities of the semester will require both. The final deliverable for the course will b e a short, personal monologue, informed by the scientific literature on identity, which you will write and then perform as part of a fully -mounted theatrical production in the Studio Theater at Babson. No playwriting or acting experience is necessary. Regi stration note: This course brings together the psychological study of identity and the theater of solo performance to ask one of the most fundamental of all questions: who am I?

AHSE2160 The Intersection of Biology, Art and Technology (IBAT) This project -based course will encourage participants to cross boundaries between art, biology and technology with hands -on projects inspired by contemporary and historical work in these fields. How might biology inform art practice and how might art inform biology? What role does technology play in advancing or restricting each field and how might art and biology inspire technological breakthroughs? What are the implications of being able to change the genome of an organism? What is art anyway? These are just some of the questions we will pursue during this course. We will begin the course with an inves tigation of the phenomena of climate change and consider what steps we might take individually and collectively to contribute to the sustainability of the planet. Visualization technologies such as the scanning electron microscope (SEM) will be utilized to observe and create artworks. Final student -designed projects are informed by biology, art and technology and encourage deep exploration and integration of these topics. Laboratory studies will enhance an understanding of biology and its relation to techno logy as well as providing a possible means to create art. We will delve into a variety of written works, films and video resources, and listen first -hand to practitioners in these areas about the challenges and rewards of interdisciplinary work in fields that most would regard as unrelated. The goal by the end of the course is to acquire an attitude that allows fluid movement from one field to the other in thinking and doing so as to garner creative strength not possible from study of each field alone.

Students learn about overarching principles that enable creators of broad interdisciplinary systems to succeed. Students will also work in teams and take on roles as design specialists in a variety o f fields. Each team is given the task to design in detail a hypothetical product that can succeed only if interdisciplinary creativity is fostered and trade offs are made by every team member, as we ll as the group as a whole. Credits: 4 ENGR. Hours: 4 -0-8. Prerequisite: ENGR2250. ENGR3232 Biomedical Device Design Medical devices can be anything from a tongue depressor to a pacemaker with a microchip to a room- sized MRI, and everything in between. In this course, we will briefly consider the range of artifa cts that are considered (bio)medical devices, how they are used, and who they are used for. We will primarily focus on the unique design constraints of and methods used in developing medical devices. We will touch on topics such as regulation and approval of devices, writing user requirements, writing product requirements, manufacturing practices, bioethics, and the body's response to implanted materials and surgical interventions. The first half of the semester will be spent developing skills through a case study model. In the second half of the semester, students will complete a major design project, with an external partner, that is focused at a particular stage of p roduct development. This course is open to students of all majors, satisfies a design dept h requirement, and can be used as a mechanical engineering elective. While the examples used are from the biomedical industry, the skills developed are relevant to other highly regulat ed fields as well (e.g. aerospace). Credits: 4 ENGR. Recommended Requisites Foundational Biology. Prerequisite: ENGR2250. Courses, Credits, Hours | 55 ENGR3235 Biomimicry We can learn from nature! From studying a leaf to make a better solar cell to emulating natural processes to develop living buildings, the discipline of Biomimicry views nature as \"model, mentor and measure\" (Benyus, 1997). Spiders spin protein silk with the strength of steel yet much lighter all at ambient temperature and pressure. Cuttlefish change color to match their surroundings in milliseconds by contracting their chromatophores and even bioluminesce. In this course we will study wonders like these to appreciate the beauty and sophistication of life by investigating the biological mechanisms and functions of organisms as well as the dynamics of whole ecosystems. By examining biologi cal systems at multiple scales, we can draw insights from understanding how they work. By collecting data, running experiments, creating models, or building prototypes, we can translate these insights into design ideas and practice. We will examine and dis cuss big ideas and thinking in biology and design and then synthesize and reflect on the intersection of these fields. Students will develop skills and insights thr ough critical analysis of readings and the development of projects that draw on both fields. Biological systems have undergone 3.8 billion years of evolution, resulting in time -tested approaches to living on earth that are efficient and embody sustainability. By exploring the intersection of biology and design, we might learn to do the same. This course is cross -listed with SCI2235. Enrollment in ENGR3235 is as design depth as projects will be focused on engineering design solutions. If advanced science credit is desired, enroll in SCI2235. Credits: 4 ENGR. Hours: foundation biology (SCI12xx). ENGR3240 Tell the Story of What You Make How do engineers creatively engage with multiple audiences and stakeholders for their work? Telling stories is critical for anyone who makes things: communicating technical work to non -experts, creating persuasive arguments for technology adoption, or projecting a future with better engineering in it. This course will cover how stories are built and how to craft your own, exploring communication design in multiple forms of media: print, images, film, music, and more. The course includes excursions to experience location -specific visual representation, multiple individual communication experiments, group collection of media, and a culminating project in which students will tell the sto ry of one of their own projects. We'll look at how music videos, cereal boxes, advertisements, grocery shopping, infographics and even people's outfits (just to name a few) can inform how you might build an effective story about one of your own projects. This course is organized into 3 main sections: Introduction, Questions and Project. Introduction: The first 4 lessons and associated assignments will act as a warmup for the class. They will help to develop a common language, encourage students to look more closely at the things around them, introduce critique into the class and set the tone for the course moving forward. Questions: The majority of the class will look at visual communication as it relates to 7 questions which cover core understandings about design. These questions build a basis for a complete critique of a design and also provide a structure on which we will explore specific elements of design such as image, type, context, organization, etc. The questions are 1) Shoul d we do this?, 2) What is the message?, 3) Who is the audience?, 4) Who else is doing this?, 5) What is the concept?, 6) What are the elements?, and 7) How is it organized? Project: The last quarter of the course will be used by students to create a visual project that communicates the story of something that they have made. Parameters for the project are decided on by the class but will include initial exploration rounds, multiple rounds of designs, in- class critique and a final deliverable visual artifact. Credits: 4 ENGR. Prereq uisite: ENGR2250. ENGR3242 Quantitative Engineering Design The engineering design process can often be completed more quickly and efficiently by applying quantitative analysis at various points. In this course, students will apply their existing skills and knowledge and learn new tools to perform quantitative analysis in the context of the design process, including techniques for validation and verification of results and communicating those results to support and effectively guide design decisions. Introductory modules will involve computation simulation tools (e.g., commercial FEA software), optimization, and system integration. In the later part of the semester, students will define and carry out the full design process, starting and ending with a user, on their own multidisciplinary projects (e.g., electromechan ical system or product). 56| Olin Prerequisite: ENGR2250. ENGR3252 Technology, Accessibility, and Design This course equips students with an interdisciplinary set of tools to design, build, and critique technologies that mediate a ccess to physica l and digital worlds. We will use disability as a lens to examine the ways in which technology (e.g., assistive, medical, consumer) can both enhance and diminish access to economic, social, and informational resources. Students will examine the history of such technologies and analyze modern trends. Building from this perspective, students will learn about design processes and implementation strategies for maximizing the accessibility of the technologies they build. During the course, student teams will work with a community partner to design a technology to enhance accessibility (along some dimension) for a user group with a disability. Students will learn and employ user- centered approaches throughout the course. Credits: 4 ENGR. Prerequisite: ENGR2250.

It incorporates formal, team- based, year - long engineering projects done in conjunction with 10 to 14 external companies. Each project will be executed by a single student team, supported by a dedicated faculty member, in partnership with one of these companies. Each student team will have between four and six members from the se nior class. Students may conduct advanced research, perform market analysis, develop experimental prototypes, design new products or redesign existing products in the execution of this project. As SCOPE is an 8 credit, year -long, fall/spring offering, a single grade will be given upon completion of 8 credits of SCOPE. After completion of the fall semester, a TBG grade will appear upon a students transcript until a grade is assigned at the end of the spring. The single grade assigned will appear in both the fall and the spring on transcripts. Students not completing a second semester of SCOPE will receive a grade for the fall and will therefore not satisfy the requirement of engineering capstone wi th the SCOPE program. Note that students not performing adequa te work in the fall semester will receive an end -of-semester notice of concern (see the Grading at Olin section of the Olin College Catalog for more information).

From studying a leaf to make a better solar cell to emulating natural processes to develop living buildings, the discipline of Biomimicry views nature as \"model, mentor and measure\" (Benyus, 1997). Spiders spin protein s ilk with the strength of steel yet much lighter all at ambient temperature and pressure. Cuttlefish change color to match their surroundings in milliseconds by contracting their chromatophores and even bioluminesce. In this course we will study wonders like these to appreciate the beauty and sophistication of life by investigating the biological mechanisms and functions of organisms as well as the dynamics of whole ecosystems. By examining biological systems at multiple scales, we can draw insights from understanding how they work. By collecting data, running experiments, creating models, or building prototypes, we can translate these insights into design ideas and practice. We will examine and discuss big ideas and thinking in biology and design and then synthesize and reflect on the intersection of these fields. Students will develop skills and insights through critical analysis of readings and the development of projects that draw on both fields. Biological systems have undergone 3.8 billion years of evolution, resulting in time -tested approaches to living on earth that are efficient and embody sustainability.

Curricular and Experiential Learning Prototypes The process of curriculum innovation at Olin College means that curricular prototypes are ongoing during most academic years. These experiments are courses that serve as designated alternatives for requirements in the curriculum. There may also be prototypes that replace a requirement in the curriculum. A curricular experiment is noted by a course code and number. Unless otherwise specif ied, each course prototype begins with CIE ( Curricular Innovation Experiment), followed by the year in which it is offered, e.g. CIE2019. If more than one experiment is running, the course number will end in a letter. Courses, Credits, Hours | 73 Current Prototypes The Thesis Res earch Option (which began in Fall 2019) enables students with research experience to work closely with an Olin faculty mentor to further develop and formalize their research skills. The Thesis Option consists of 2 semesters of advanced research with a faculty advisor and culminates in a thesis document written by the student and a presentation/defense with a thesis committee. Students accepted into the program will be enrolled in ISR -G courses, as appropriate, and will carry the title of Thesis Research for the first semester and Thesis for the second. This curriculum prototype will be available through spring 2023 as an experiment. In the fall semester of 2020, Olin began a strategic initiative to develop new educational approaches in engineering education to addre ss three interlocking aspirations: 1) to create an education that is accessible and equitable, and moves toward dismantling systemic racism, 2) to create an education that is deeply transformative, that opens doors for students, and helps them grow and realize their potential, and 3) to create an education that has a sustainable business model that responds to financial challenges within higher education. Curricular prototypes developed under this initiative will involve a range of partners, be designed for equity and access, and enable institutional learning to shape Olin's future. Prototypes that award academic credit will be overseen by Olin faculty, enable student degree progression, offer meaningful learning experiences, and align with the Olin Learning Outcomes (p. 18). Co-curriculars Co-curricular offerings are (1) non- credit activities combining fu n and intellectual awareness, (2) scheduled for a limited time (e.g., one semester), (3) led by a staff or faculty member or by a student working in concert with a faculty/staff member, and (4) funded by the Student Affairs and Resources office. They differ from curricular offerings in that they are not graded and attendance is not strictly enforced. They differ from extra -curricular activities in that they have an intellectual component, faculty/staff leadership, and limited lifespan. 74| Olin College of Engineering Catalog 2021 -22 Olin's official Academic Policies and Procedures are listed here. To access the practical resources needed for administrative tasks such as requesting a transcript, petitioning for a course substitution or cross -registering to another school, ple ase visit the Registrar's Office Services on the Olin website. Attendance Students are expected to attend all classes at Olin. Each instructor will establish and publish the class attendance policies for reporting anticipated absences an d making up missed work, including lab experiences and project work. The Dean of the College will grant exceptions for illness, religious observance, or other reasons deemed appropriate. Olin Exposition (EXPO) The Olin Exposi tion is an event at the end of each semester where students present academic and non -academic work to an audience that includes the entire Olin community and, often, external visitors. It is an opportunity for students to reflect on the semester, celebrate their achievements and share them with others, practice communication skills, and demonstrate their activities and abilities. Expo is also an opportunity for people outside the college to see what Olin students can do, and it is an important way of involving external constituencies in the activities of the school. Normally all registered students are required to participate in Expo in the fall. In the spring, first through third year students are required to present at Expo while seniors are required to participate in the end of year SCOPE Summit. Students who cannot attend Expo for any reason should petition the Dean of the College as early as possible for an excused absence. Definition of full- time status Enrollment at Olin College is for full- time study in engineering. Students are expected to follow the curriculum design for each class year and carry a usual load of 16 degree credits. The definition of full -time study is a minimum of 12 attempted degree credits each semester with a maximum* of 20 attempted degree credits each semester. Part-time study is generally not available at Olin College; however, special cases will be considered by the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs. *In the first semester, first -year students are limited to attempting a maximum of 18 credits of degree and non -degree credits. Course overloads Olin students may register for a maximum of 20 credits each semester. The maximum load of 20 credits is a total of degree and non-degree activities. In exceptional circumstances, students may petition the Committee on Student Academic Performance (COSAP) with the consent of their advisor for approval of a course overload. Additionally, COSA P may reduce the maximum credits allowed. This reflects Olin's commitment to reasonable expectations and academic success. First -year, first -semester students are limited to taking a maximum of 18 credits. Class standing Class standi ng is determined by the number of degree credits a student has earned in relation to the 120 required for graduation. The following table is a breakdown of earned degree credits and their corresponding class year and represents a reasonable expectation of progress toward a degree over four years. Class Earned Degree Credits First-Year 0-30 Academic Policies and Procedures Academic Poli cies and Procedures | 75 Sophomore 31-60 Junior 61-90 Senior > 90 Declaration of major/change of major Students are expected to declare their major no later than the time of registration for the fourth semester (sophomore year). At this time, there is a Major Declarathon where curriculum and program advising is available and an introduction to the process is presented. Olin understands that a student's path toward their degree may change and, as a result, during the fifth or sixth semester, t here is a Junior Reality Check, where students update their program plans of study. Lastly, senior audits take place during a student's final two semesters. Senior audits take many forms and begin via consultation between a student and their advisor. There are also drop in sessions with the Registrar's Office, and opportunit ies for plan of study updates. The process c ulminates with degree certification by the Registrar and Faculty. Note: Students who change their major should be aware of their remaining degree requirements. Additionally, they are responsible for tuition, room/board and fees for any semesters required beyond the eight covered by the Olin scholarship. Registration Prior to each semester, there will be a designated registration period in which students will speak with their advisors and m ake choices on course selection. Registration is done on- line. Instructions are available each semester in the pub lished registration booklets. NOTE: Courses available at the time of registration may be subject to cancellation based on enrollment. Cross -registration Olin has cross -registration agreements with Babson College, Brandeis University and Wellesley College (the BBW schools). These agreements increase the academic offerings available to Olin students in the natural and mathematical sciences, arts, humanities, social sciences, business and entrepreneurship. Olin students, with the exc eption of first -semester, first -year students, are permitted to enroll for one course each semester at each of the BBW schools, subject to the continuation of the cross -registration agreements. Cross- registering for a course at a BBW school will count towa rd a student's total degree credit load at Olin. Normally, Olin students are not permitted to take courses at BBW schools which would substantially duplicate the content of a course or set of courses available at Olin, but may petition the Course Substitution and Transfer Board (CSTB) for an exception to this rule. With prior approval from the CSTB, students may use courses taken at the BBW schools to satisfy general course requirements, distribution requirements and program specific course requirements. Students are responsible for all deadlines and registration procedures related to the host school, including, but not limited t o, pass/fail, drop, add, withdrawal policies. Information regarding procedures for cross -registration is provided in the semesters' registration booklet. NOTE: Due to the variation of grading deadlines at BBW schools, seniors are strongly encouraged not to cross- register during their final semester at Olin. The add period During the first 10 instructional days of a semester, students may alter their schedules by adding and/or dropping a course on-line using my.olin.edu. Discussions between students and their advisors are strongly recommended. Students are responsible for submitting their request no later than the 10th class day. Courses cannot be added after the 10th class day. Special circumstances may be granted for BBW sponsored courses when there is a variation in the academic calendars. 76| Olin College of Engineering Catalog 2021 -22 The drop period After the Add Period, students may decide to drop a course from their schedule without penalty as long as they maintain a minimum of 12 degree credits. The drop date is the 45th instructional day of the semester. Course drops during this period must be made in person at the Registrar's office and require the appropriate instructing faculty signature and the student advisor signature. Course withdrawal Students may withdraw from courses up through the last day of instruction in the semester. To withdraw from a cour se, students need written approval from the instructing faculty member and their advisor. Students must then process the course withdrawal with the Registrar's Office. A grade of Withdrawn (W) will be entered for the course and will not affect the grade point average. Credits attempted will be noted, but course credit will not be earned. Students are responsible for meeting with their advisor to determine how the credits, and/or requirement will be completed in the future. Olin students cross -registered at one of the BBW schools must follow the academic policy on course withdrawals for the host school. Half-semester courses The Add, Drop and Course Withdrawal periods are prorated for half semester courses. The Add Period is the first five days of the session. The Drop Period is 10 days prior to the last day of instruction for that session. Course withdrawals can be done up through the last instructional day of the half -semester course. Grading at Olin Philosophy Standards -based grading: Course grading at Olin will be based on student progress toward defined course goals. Summary metrics (e.g., GPA) will be provided on the student's transcript, but relative summary metrics (e.g., class rank) are neither published nor tabulated. The Dean of Faculty will annually conduct a review of grade distributions and grading procedures. Grading rules and regulations 1. Privacy: Olin will not publicly post either grades or summary metrics (e.g., GPAs) in any form that allows identification of any particular individual's performance. It is expected that students will respect the privacy of each other's grades. 2. Grading clarity requirements: On the first day of instruction, each Olin class will publish the following informa tion: a. Learning objectives that specify the knowledge, skills and attitudes that students are expected to develop or attain in the class. The learning objectives should be an effective instrument for students to understand what they will learn and how their learning will be evaluated. b. Grading criteria that specify how the final course grade is determined. Some aspects of grading are necessarily based on the professional judgment of instructors, informed by their experience, and are subjective. c. Feedb ack: Olin expects instructors to provide students with feedback on their performance. If an instructor feels a student will not pass a course, or if the instructor is otherwise concerned about a student's performance, the instructor will issue a notice of academic concern in a timely manner. Copies of this notice will be sent to the student, the student's faculty advisor and the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs for Advising. If a course is offered as year-long and utilizes a first semester TBG grade option, the course instructor will issue an end -of-semester notice of concern for any student not making satisfactory progress in the first half of the course. This end- of-semester notice will be considered a deficiency in the student's overall semester progress and the student will be reviewed at the end of the fall semester Academic Progress meeting of COSAP. 3. End of semester feedback to the advisor: Olin advisors have real -time access to advisees' course grades through the Student Information System. In addition, instructors will notify advisors of any significant concerns noted during the semester. Academic Policies and Procedures | 77 4. Pass/No Record first semester: In the first semester of the first year, students receive only a grade of Pass (P) or No Record (NR). A grade of No Record does not affect the student's GPA and does not appear on the student's official transcript. A student who receives a grade of NR cannot use the class to satisfy a course requirement or use it as a prerequisite. Courses where an NR is earned require a repeated attempt at the student's earliest convenience. All repeated attempts of first year, first semester courses at Olin will be graded as pass/no credit and the assessment earned will appear on the transcript, yet will not impact the student's GPA. 5. Course g rades: Course grades at Olin provide students, their advisors, potential employers and graduate schools information about overall performance. Course grades are determined based upon a mix of demonstrated comprehension, skill, participation and effort. 6. Grading scale: The Olin College grading scheme contains letter grades with a resulting grade point average (GPA) on a four-point scale. Students will be assessed using the following interpretation: Grade Assessment Description Point Value A Excellent 4.0 A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B Good 3.0 B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C Fair 2.0 C- 1.7 CR Credit (for non -degree course activity) n/a D+ 1.3 D Poor 1.0 EG Experimental Grading n/a F Failing 0.0 I Incomplete n/a IF Incomplete Failing 0.0 IL Incomplete/Leave of Absence (temporary grade) n/a IP In Progress (temporary grade) n/a L/NR Leave/No Record n/a MET Objectives of the course have been MET n/a NC No Credit for Pass/No Credit Option n/a NCR No Credit (for non -degree course activity) n/a 78| Olin College of Engineering Catalog 2021 -22 NG No Grade Reported by Instructor (temporary grade) n/a NPP No Passionate Pursuit Recognition (internal designation) n/a NR No Record n/a P Pass n/a PP Passionate Pursuit Recognition n/a R Course Repeated n/a TBG To Be Graded (represents first semester placeholder for required yearlong courses) n/a * TR Transfer Credit n/a UNM Objectives of the course are UNMET n/a W Withdrew from Course n/a *see item 3 related to notice of academic concern for academic progress standings 7. Experimental grading: The 'EG' grade represents an \"Experimental Grade\" designation, implemented in a small number of courses during a curricular experiment that began in 2009. Each student may undertake no more than one \"EG\" course per semester. An 'EG' grade in a student's transcript indicates that a student completed the course's learning objectives and received instructor feedback based upon cr iteria that do not have direct mapping onto the ABCDF grading system. Students who do not complete the learning objectives will receive a \"no credit\" designation on their transcript (similar to the \"no credit\" option for pass/no credit courses). 8. Repeated courses: If a student retakes a course at Olin the original grade will remain, but will not be factored into the student's GPA. The new grade will appear on the transcript in the semester in which the course was retaken. There is no guarantee that any course will be offered for a student to repeat, as in the case of, but not limited to, Special Topics courses. For courses in the first year, first semester that require repeat see item #4 above. Repeated courses may be used in Financial Aid Satisfactory Aca demic Progress Pace of Progression calculations. 9. Minimally sufficient grades: A grade of D, EG, or Pass is sufficient to earn credit for a course. A grade of D or EG is sufficient to satisfy a course requirement. A grade of C -, EG, or Pass is sufficie nt to satisfy a prerequisite requirement. 10. Pass/No Credit: Up to 12 credits of a student's distribution requirements may be satisfied by taking classes that are usually offered for grades as Pass/No Credit. In such cases, a Pass is given for performance equivalent to a grade of C - or higher. Courses taken Pass/No Credit may not be used to meet course requirements unless the course is not offered for grades or is taken in the first semester of the first year. Courses that are only offered Pass/No Credit, Independent Study and Research do not count toward the 12 credit limit. Students must declare their Pass/No Credit grading option by the drop date of each semester. The Pass/No Credit option does not impact the GPA; either Pass or No Credit will appear on the transcript. Once a student decides to take a course Pass/No Credit, they cannot revert back to receive a letter grade. 11. Passionate Pursuits: Passionate Pursuits are non- degree credit, and will be listed on the transcript if the nature of the activity and the level of completion are sufficient to merit credit. 12. The Olin transcript: A student's academic transcript at Olin includes the following information: a. A list of classes the student took in each semester, and a record of the student's final grades in those classes. First - semester first -year transcripts will show only classes that were passed. Classes taken Pass/No Credit after the first year appear either as a Pass or as a No Credit. b. The student's GPA. c. A list of non -degree activities taken each semester with a cumulative total of credits earned. There are no grades associated with non- degree activities. d. Co-Curricular offerings in which the sponsoring staff or faculty member reported sufficient student participation for a transcript notation. Academic Policies and Procedures | 79 13. Grading and credits of cross -registered courses: Olin students who cross -register for a course at Babson, Brandeis, or Wellesley will receive credit for the course if they receive a passing grade. All grades wi ll be recorded on their transcript and be factored into their grade point average. Credits from these schools will be counted on a one for one basis at Olin. For example, if a three credit course is taken at Babson, it will count as three Olin credits. A o ne unit Brandeis or Wellesley course is equal to four Olin credits. Courses that use other accounting schemes may be translated into equivalent Olin credits rounded to the closest integer. 14. Circumstantial grading: is used in a semester of extraordinary disruption (e.g., pandemic), and is authorized by a faculty vote or by the Provost/Dean of Faculty when a quorum of the faculty cannot be met. A grade of MET satisfies course, distribution, and prerequisite requirements. A grade of UNM (unmet) does not satisfy course, distribution, and prerequisite requirements. Academic Integrity It is expected that students will behave with integrity and according to the Honor Code. Incomplete Policy In the event that a student experiences an acute circumstance that prohibits them from participating in a course or courses, they can request an incomplete to have extra time to make up their missed work. In other words an Incomplete is generally approved only when some specific event or illness prevents the student from completing a specific part of the course (such as compl eting a paper, project or exam). An Incomplete cannot be approved in instances where a student is demonstrating an overall difficulty covering or understanding the course materials and appears to need more time or additional instruction to learn the materi al. If such general difficulty occurs the student should discuss available options with his or her course instructor and advisor well before the end of the semester. A student may request an Incomplete (\"I\") grade by petitioning the Assistant Dean of Stude nt Affairs. The deadline to request an incomplete is the last day of classes , unless the acute circumstance occurs during finals week, in which case an exception could be made. If an Incomplete grade is approved, the student will be granted an extension period to complete the coursework. The Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, in consult with others as appropriate, will determine the period of the extension with the instructor and student. In no circumstances may the extension be later than the end of the subsequent semester. A grade of \"I\" will be listed as a temporary grade and will not affect the grade point average. If the work is not completed by the approved deadline, the incomplete grade of \"I\" will be changed to \"IF\", Incomplete Failing, or an alternate grade upon approval of the instructor. An \"IF\" grade does affect a grade point average. In some cases a student may need to leave during the semester for a medical reason but, given the timing if the request and t he type of work that needs to be completed, the student may be able to complete the work for the semester away from Olin. If that is the case and the need occurs after the 33 rd day of instruction, a student can request a Medical Incomplete (\"MI\") for each course. An agreement would need to be reached between the student and each individual faculty member, and may not be possible for all courses in which the student is enrolled, which may result in withdrawal from some courses. A Medical Incomplete must be requested prior to the last day of instruction for the semester and may not be requested after that point. A student taking a Medical Incomplete must inform the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs about their intention to complete the work or take a Medical Withdrawal by the last day of instructi on for the semester. If the student does not inform the Assistant Dean of their plans then their status will be changed to Medical Withdrawal. Extra help For all courses, faculty members provide extra help for students as appropriate. In addition, individual tutors are assigned by Student Affairs. Students who feel that individual tutoring would be helpful to them should contact the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs for Advising as early in the semester as the need becomes apparent. 80| Olin College of Engineering Catalog 2021 -22 Grade changes Dispute of a grade Students wishing to dispute a grade should first have a discussion with the instructing faculty member. If the student and faculty are in disagreement after the discussion, the student may appeal to the Dean of Faculty. The Dean of Faculty will meet with the student within 14 days of the appeal and will solicit a statement from the faculty member. Following this process, the Dean of Faculty will review the case and submit a recommendation to the faculty member. The faculty member will then make a final decision, in consultation with the Dean of Faculty. After one calendar year (from the end of the original grading period), all grades are final. All grade changes must be made in writing and signed by the De an of Faculty. Excused Absences for Final Exams Students who are unable to take their final exams for legitimate reasons and wish to request a make -up exam generally must obtain advance authorization from the instructing faculty members and Student Affairs. In the event that advance authorization cannot be obtained due to extenuating circumstances, students should contact Student Affairs and the instructor(s) as soon as they are able. If the exam is not completed prior to the end of the grading period, a grade of I, Incomplete, will be recorded on the student record. An incomplete grade is a temporary grade that does not affect a grade point average. Graduation Petition survey Students expecting to complete their degrees or walk in Olin's May commencement ceremony must complete an on -line petition survey. This survey indicates the students' intent to complete their Olin degree and initiates the final degree audit process. This survey is typically available six months prior to commencement. Graduation walk policy Degree candidates are allowed to walk in one ceremony for their degree. Students who are off sequence may walk with the class with which they entered or with their actual degree year class. If the choice is to walk with the entry year class, the student must file a degree plan for completion of the degree by March 1st of the walk year and must be within 16 credits of completing said degree. Conferral dates Olin College confers degrees yearly each May and has only one ceremony per year. Completion date When a student completes their degree requirements at the conclusion of the fall semester, their record will be marked as complete with a degree pending. The student must apply for their degree conferral in the following May ceremony. Their record will then be updated to graduate following the May date. Student right -to-know act: Retention and graduation rates Under the Student Right -to-Know Act, educational institutions are required to disclose to current and prospective students their retention and graduation rates. The calculations below are in accordance with the formulas and definitions of the United Stat es Department of Education. The retention of first -time, first- year students who return in the following fall semester is 81% for the 2019 cohort of new students. The graduation rate is defined as the percentage of first -time students who complete their degree program within 150 percent of the normal completion time for that degree (six years for an Olin bachelor degree). For the 2015 entering class, the graduate rate is 97%. Academic Policies and Procedures | 81 Additional information is available from the Registrar and the Office of Institutional Research & Decision Support. Curriculum and Policy Committees Academic Recommendation Board (ARB) Subcommittee: Course Substitution and Transfer Board (CSTB) Committee on Student Academic Performance (COSAP) Academic Recommendation Board (ARB) The Academic Recommendation Board (ARB) has the responsibility to foster change and act as a steward of the curriculum. The ARB regularly reviews the curricular structure and course options and reviews and authorizes changes in degree requirements. Students may petition the ARB if they need to apply for an exception to graduation requirements. Course Substitution and Transfer Board (CSTB) The Course Substitution and Transfer Board (CSTB) is a subcommittee of the ARB and has the responsibility of awarding Olin credit for classes taken at another institution. There are three cases where a student can take a class at another institution and get credit toward an Ol in degree: cross registration at Babson, Brandeis or Wellesley; classes taken during a Study Away experience; and classes taken at another institution during a summer or before enrolling at Olin. For more information on transferring credit, see Transfer Cr edit section. The CSTB also determines what distribution and course requirements a non -Olin course can count for. Many courses at the BBW schools have been pre -approved. Prior to taking a non -Olin class not on the pre -approval list, students should request permission from the CSTB to count this class toward satisfying a distribution or course requirement. Committee on Student Academic Performance (COSAP) The Committee on Student Academic Performance (COSAP) is charged by the Dean of the College and is empowered to review, interpret and propose academic performance policies. This committee considers petitions to waive existing academic performance regulations and acts as an appellate body for students with academic performance grievances. The committee also examines the records of students who are not making satisfactory progress toward a degree. This committee is chaired by the Dean of the College or the Dean's designee (non -voting, except in the case of a tie) and consists of the Registrar (non- voting), the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and two faculty members. Students wishing to appeal a decision made by COSAP must submit their appeal to the Registrar within one week of the original decision. COS AP also reviews student petitions for exceptions to academic performance policy. The twenty credit maximum course load policy is a typical example of a petition to COSAP. There is no form to complete. Interested students should discuss their course load with their advisor and then write a detailed petition that outlines the rationale. Students should include their advisor on the email petition, as the advisor is always asked for feedback. Petitions should be emailed to registrar@olin.edu no late r than the l ast day to add a course. Student academic performance The Committee on Student Academic Performance uses the following guidelines in determining the academic status of students. Students not in Good Academic Standing will be placed on probation. Students not in Good Academic Standing for two consecutive semesters will be reviewed by the committee and may be required to withdraw. The committee may consider extenuating circumstances in applying these general guidelines. NO TE: In accordance with federal regulations of Title IV Financial Aid Program Integrity Standards, the Financial Aid Office will review academic performance in accordance with the performance measures listed below and will include an overall pace of progres sion standard. See the financial aid section for more information. 82| Olin College of Engineering Catalog 2021 -22 Qualitative measure of academic performance Student's first semester: Good Academic Standing is defined as receiving Pass grades in all courses by the start of the second semester. Subseque nt semesters: Good Academic Standing is defined as having a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00 by the end of the semester. During times when circumstantial grading is in play (see Grading at Olin), the qualitative measure will be amended to mir ror the binary standard of circumstantial grading (met/unmet). Good Academic Standing is defined as receiving all MET grades (or a minimum grade of C in any session I course) for the semester. Students who do not meet 'good academic standing' may be placed on academic probation. Quantitative measure of academic performance In order to complete the degree in four years (eight semesters), each student will normally take 16 credits (four courses) pe r semester. Olin College expects students to make reasonable progress toward their degree each semester. As a result, to remain in good standing a student must complete a minimum of 12 degree credits each semester. The Committee on Student Academic Performance will review this quantitative measure in addition to th e qualitative measure of a minimum grade point average. During times when circumstantial grading is in play (see Grading at Olin),the quantitative measure will remain unchanged, e.g. students must continue to earn a minimum of 12 credits in the semester to remain in good standing. Students who do not meet 'good academic standing' may be placed on academic probation. Academic readmission In making decisions on readmission petitions, the Committee on Student Academic Performance (COSAP) will expect the forme r student to produce timely evidence of good academic performance in college courses comparable to Olin courses, employment and/or community service references and a formal statement explaining changes that will contribute to their academic success at Olin . Credit for courses taken elsewhere while a student is withdrawn from Olin will be transferable to Olin only if approval is obtained from the CSTB prior to enrollment in each course. College withdrawal Withdrawal from the Colleg e Voluntary withdrawal Students may wish to leave Olin College prior to completing their degree and can voluntarily withdraw from the College. Such a decision may be difficult to make. We encourage students to discuss the situation with their faculty advisor and the Assist ant Dean of Student Affairs. Students must request a withdrawal form with the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs. Withdrawing for non medical reasons during a semester will yield a grade of \"W\" (Withdrew) on the academic record for all courses enrolled. I f Volunt ary Withdrawal occurs after the last instructional day of the semester, grades from that semester will appear on the transcript. Dropping all registered courses does not automatically result in an official withdrawal from the college. Financial Aid recipie nts who drop all registered courses and/or officially withdraw from the college prior to the 60% point of a semester should note that this action will result in a review of their financial aid eligibility and a possible refund of monies to th e Department o f Education. Students should consider whether a Leave of Absence might provide a more suitable means for them to address their needs. Students for whom a Leave of Absence is most appropriate should follow the procedures for requesting a Leave. Please refer to the Leave of Absence Policy. Medical Withdrawal Academic Policies and Procedures | 83 Students who need to withdraw from Olin College for medical reasons should request a Withdrawal form from the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and indicate Medical Withdrawal. Medical documentation may be required to complete the process. Medical Withdrawals during a semester (by the last instructional day of a semester) will result in deletion of the semester's registration from the student's record. Students may be entitled to a full or partial refund of certain expenses and fees according to the guidelines of the College's Refund Policy. Students who are on a Medical Withdrawal may not return to campus or attend college events (on- campus or off -campus) without written permission of the Dean of the College. Permission must be requested at least ten business days in advance of the event. Required and Administrative Withdrawal At times, the Dean of the College (or the Dean's designee) may require a student to withdraw from Olin College for academic or any other reasons. Students who are required to withdraw may not return to campus or attend college events (on -campus or off-campus) without written permission of the Dean of the College. Permission must be requested at least ten business days in advance o f the event. Once a Student is Withdrawn Once a student withdraws they typically have 48 hours to vacate their residence hall room. Specific arrangements should be made with the Associate Dean of Student Affairs. Students must return their room key to the Associate Dean of Student Affairs and leave their room in the condition in which they found it. Students who are Withdrawn may not leave items in College storage unless it is appropriate for the circumstances and individual arrangements are made with the Associate Dean of Student Affairs. Return Following Withdrawal Each request for readmission after withdrawal (voluntary, medical, required, or administrative) is assessed on its individual merits. As such, readmission requirements will vary. Written ap proval from the Dean of the College is required for readmission. To request readmission the student must complete the Readmission Form and send it to the Dean of the College no later than 30 days prior to the first day on instruction for the semester in which the student plans to return. The Dean will follow up with any requests for additional information. Leave of absence (LOA) Students in good academic standing may request a leave of absence for up to 180 days in any 12 -mont h period. Leaves of absence may not be used for study away. To initiate a leave of absence, students should meet with their advisor and request a Leave of Absence from the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs. Documentation of the reason for the leave of abse nce (medical or otherwise) may accompany the request for a leave, if requested. The request, if approved, and any accompanying documentation will be forwarded to the Registrar for processing and placed in the student's academic file. Leave of Absences cannot be approved after the start of the semester for which the student is requesting the leave. When a Leave of Absence is approved, student status will be noted as \"On Leave.\" If a leave is not approved, students have the right to app eal the decision to the Dean of the College within two weeks of the date of the denial of leave. There are two kinds of leaves: A leave of absence mid semester: This type of leave is requested when a semester is in active session*. In this case, all courses for which the student is registered will be temporarily designated as Incomplete/ Leave of Absence (IL). Any course that is not subsequently completed will then be changed to a grade of Leave/No Record (L/NR) and will be recorded internally for that co urse. Incomplete/Leave of Absence and Leave/No Record grades do not affect the student's grade point average. The effective date of this leave is the approval date of the leave. Incomplete/Leave of Absence grades must be completed no later than 90 days after the student's return date, or at another date determined by the faculty member and advisor. 84| Olin College of Engineering Catalog 2021 -22 *This active session does not include the study or final exam period. If a student has an unexpected event that impacts his or her ability to take a final exam, he or she should refer to the Excused Absences for Final Exams policy. A leave of absence between semesters: This type of a leave is requested for a future semester when there is a circumstance that impacts the student's ability to continue in sequence. In this type of leave, there are no grade entries made. The student's schedule for the ensuing semester will be deleted. The student will be placed on leave effective the first day of the upcoming semester for up to 180 days in any 12- month period. If a st udent does not return from a leave of absence or extends beyond the maximum 180 days in any 12- month period, the student will be withdrawn from the college back to the original date of the leave. All Incomplete/Leave of Absence grades will be changed to Leave/No Record. NOTE: this applies to both types of leaves. Returning from a Leave All students taking an LOA are expected to return in the semester following the leave. Therefore, they will be given a registration time and will should contact Housing a minimum of 30 days before the start of a return semester. When considering housing needs, notification is best made in October for spring returns and April for fall returns. Requests to return are considered on a case- by-case basis. Transfer credit Olin College generally does not accept transfer credit for incoming students, but the Course Substitution and Transfer Board (CSTB) may grant exceptions on a case -by-case basis for incoming students who have demonstrated strong performance in rigorous cour ses taken at accredited institutions. Enrolled students wishing to take a course at another college and transfer the credits to Olin must obtain prior approval from the CSTB. A student will need to provide detailed information about the school and the course including, but not limited to, a course description and syllabus. Minimal conditions to determine appropriate schools and courses are 1) the institution must be accredited, and 2) the institution should offer, at minimum, Bachelor degree programs. NOTE: In general, Olin does not accept transfer credit from community colleges. On- line courses may be accepted provided that items 1 and 2 above are fulfilled. The CSTB will ask appropriate faculty to review the course materials before granting approval. If approved, the CSTB will notify the student in writing. Once the course is completed, it is the student's responsibility to have an official transcrip t sent to Olin College. Provided the student meets the minimum grade (B - or equivalent) requirement for transfer, the course and the credits will appear on the student's Olin transcript. To ensure standard equivalencies for transfer, the course must be taken for a letter grade or equivalent. Pass/fail grading does not transfer to Olin. In order to receive a degre e from Olin, matriculated students must earn at least 60 of their credits from Olin or BBW courses. Approved coursework will appear on student transcripts with the name of the institution issuing the academic credit, the cour se title and the credits earned (in equivalence to the Olin semester credit hour). These credits are included in the cumulative earned hours total. NOTE: The pace of progression calculation for financial aid satisfactory academic progress uses credits taken aw ay in both attempted and earned categories. See the Student Handbook financial aid section for more details. AP exams and advanced study Olin College does not accept AP Exam credit for incoming students. Olin College does, however recognize that many students enter Olin with a strong background in various disciplines and works to ensure that all students are challenged by the curriculum. In exceptional cases in which incoming students have taken college -level courses that are equivalent to required courses at Olin, students may petition the Course Substitution and Transfer Board (CSTB) to substitute a prior course for a relevant course requirement. In such cases, the corresponding distribution requirements remain undiminished. Academic Policies and Procedures | 85 Disability Services Disability Services at Olin (DSO) is committed to providing equal opportunities and access to education programs, and activities for all students with disabilities. We engage in an interactive process with each student and review requests for accommodations on a case- by-case basis. Furthermore, we are available as a resource and source of information to all members of the Olin community around access and disability rights. Using a social model of disability, DSO aims to reduce barriers for students with disabilities to access their education. If you have a documented disability (or think you may have a disability) and would like to register with Disability Services at Olin (DSO), please contact our Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, Adva Waranyuwat at adva.waranyuwat@olin.edu. Confidentiality Statement DSO works with students confidentially and does not disclose any medical or disability- related information without their permission. In partnership with faculty and other student services offices, information is shared only on an as -needed basis and in accordance with confidentiality policies and procedures. Reasonable accommodations policy Disability Services at Olin (DSO) collaborates with and empowers individuals who have documented disabilities by working together proactively to determine reasonable and appropriate accommodations in a variety of avenues that impact student life (academic, housing, dietary). We value a community approach to understanding disability as an integral part of diversity and work in collaboration with stakeholders on campus to promote a holistic and informed approach to accessibility. It is Olin College's policy to comply fully with all state and federal disability laws. Olin does not discriminate against applicants or students with disabilities, and will consider modification to academic programs where necessary to ensure that our requirements are not discriminatory, as long as the modifications do not fundament ally alter the nature of our programs. Student Affairs coordinates services for students with learning disabilities, sensory impairments, psychological disabilities and medical conditions. Academic Accommodations The ADA does not require colleges or universities to lower academic standards or fundamentally alter the nature of the programs provided. Students with documented disabilities must meet all requirements for graduation. A reasonable accommodation is a modification to adjustment to a course, program, service, activity, or facility that removes an existing barrier to access, so that qualified students with disabilities have equal opportunities to attain the same levels o f performance or enjoy equal benefits and privileges as are available to similarly situated students without disabilities. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive. Students are responsible for identifying themselves to the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and providing appropriate documentation of their disability and need for accommodation. Services for students with learning disabilities may include, but are not limited to, academic accommodations, coaching on organizational and time management skills, and academic advising. Services for students with physical, sensory, or psychological impairments as well as medical conditions may include, but are not limited to, academic accommodations, assistance with adaptive technology, accessibility accommodations, and academic advising. Any specific modifications granted will be based on detailed discussions with each student about their particular situation, on information from a medical or health care provider concerning the student's disability and related needs, and on an open dialogue about educational expectations. In other words, disability services is seen as an ongoing conversation that we are always open to having, depending on the student's needs and experiences. Advising and Academic Support Services Academic Advising Every student at Olin has an advisor who is available to answer questions and offer guidance about a student's progress to graduation, major requirements, course options, and other aspects of academic health and decision -making at Olin. Advising relationships can have a significant impact on a student's experience. Olin has a network of faculty, staff, students, and alumni who comprise a multi -faceted resource for guidance and support within and outside the classroom. 86| Olin College of Engineering Catalog 2021 -22 Students who wish to switch faculty advisors can request to do so by contacting the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs. Any changes to faculty advising assignments will be made at the end or beginning of each semester. Academic Assistance Instructors Students who need further clarification on course requirements and projects should feel empowered to seek assistance from their faculty instructors. Faculty instructors can arrange office hours as needed and can serve as an invaluable source of information as students work on any number of proje cts and assignments. Faculty can also help a student determine any need for additional resources. Course Assistants (CAs) Many faculty instructors employ CAs for class. These students have demonstrated strength in understanding course materials and are a vital resource for students with questions. CAs often hold office hours in the residence halls during times that ar e acces sible to classmates. They can provide assistance in large and small group settings as well as on an individual basis. Tutors Students in any class can also request a tutor. Students may do this for many different reasons, including that they feel that individualized attention will be beneficial for their success in a course. Tutors are often nominated by faculty instructors and are employed by the college. Students who feel that individual tutoring would be helpful to them should contact the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs as early in the semester as the need becomes apparent. Since the Student Affairs and Resources (StAR) office employs tutors on an as -requested basis, please allow time to locate and connect tutors and students together. ARCs ( Academic Resource Co -Designers) ARCs are available as academic resources to students who may need assistance with academic skills such as time management, prioritization, study skills, stress management, etc. ARCs are trained in facilitation and listening skills, academic skills coaching, and peer mentorship. ARCs will be available to meet 1:1 and also as part of a walk- in service called the ARCade, located in the Library. ARCs may also associate with particular classes as a resource for students, facilit ate workshops on timely issues that affect students, and create resources for students to use. Delay in reaching out tends to have a cumulative, detrimental effect on academic progress in a course. Since Olin classes ar e largely project -based, work volume increases quickly and unpredictably. Technology Requirements Olin has a responsibility to verify that students enrolled in courses at Olin are able to access the educational program in w hich they are enrolled. This includes ensuring that students have adequate technology to ensure access. Therefore, student s are required to have regular access to at minimum to an adequate computer (minimum for video is operating camera and audio/speakers/microphone/headphones appropriate for group video engagement) and internet (at least1 megabit/second upload and 1 megabit/ second download bandwidth, per and <500ms network latency). For computational coursework (including SolidWorks), a computer with a Windows 10 system, <5 years old, with Intel i7 dual -core 2ghz+ processor, discrete graphics, 8 gig RAM, and solid state hard drive are adequate. Olin student laptops, purchased Fall 2017 and later, meet this requirement. The Olin campus internet meets the internet requirement. The IT Wiki has more information on testing and maximizing internet connectivity.
