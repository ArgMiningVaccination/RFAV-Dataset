Some children, especially those on the [autism spectrum](https://epidemicanswers.org/symptoms_and_diagnoses/autism-spectrum-disorder/), are particularly sensitive to detoxification protocols due to the \"herxheimer\" or \"healing\" reactions they experience after treatment. The greater the \" [toxic overload](https://epidemicanswers.org/about-the-epidemic/why-are-we-so-sick/environmental-toxicity/)\" of the child, the more sensitivity will be experienced by the child. Many parents have great concerns (and rightly so) about the kind of detoxification protocol they should choose for their very sensitive child. Traditional allopathic medicine detoxification protocols often times are too powerful for the sensitive child. [Homeopathy](https://epidemicanswers.org/reference-library/mind-body-spirit/homeopathy/), on the other hand, is a very gentle non-toxic way of treating the body, especially for the sensitive child. Homotoxicology is a way of detoxing the body utilizing homeopathy, botanicals and nutritional supplements that detoxify and restore the body to normal health. Homotoxicology is based on the principles of homeopathy, and, therefore, is thought to be the bridge between traditional allopathic medicine and homeopathic medicine. What Is Homeopathy? [Homeopathy](https://epidemicanswers.org/reference-library/mind-body-spirit/homeopathy/) is a system of medicine founded in the early 19th century by German physician, Dr. Samuel Hahnemann. Homeopathy is based on the principle of \"like attracts like\", meaning if a substance causes a symptom in a person, you give a very small amount of the same substance and the symptoms can clear. The homeopathic remedy enhances the body's innate ability to heal and only a minimum dose is needed to affect this course of action. Homeopathic remedies come in pill, liquid or powder form and are natural substances derived from plant, animal and mineral sources. What Is Homotoxicology? Over 50 years ago, a German physician, Hans-Heinrich Reckeweg, developed homotoxicology: the study of toxins and their removal from the body. Homotoxicology integrates the treatment principles of homeopathy with the diagnostic approach of allopathic medicine. It does not focus on the child's symptoms, but rather on the underlying root causes which, in most cases, are the \"homotoxins\" that are disrupting the normal functioning of the body's biochemistry. The main principal of homotoxicology is to detoxify the body at a cellular level. Therefore, homotoxicology utilizes very complex homeopathic remedies to eliminate the toxins and restore the body to balance. For children on the autism spectrum, it is best to eliminate first the toxins and prepare the child's body before considering other types of treatment protocols that may not be as effective otherwise. What Is Heilkunst Homeopathy? Heilkunst homeopathy is another type of homeopathy that seeks to remove blockages that prevent the person from reaching their highest potential on all levels: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. It has been described as a \"comprehensive, integrated system of Western medicine based on principles of natural law regarding the removal of disease and the restoration of balance in our functioning (healing).\" One important aspect of Heilkunst homeopathy is the \"timeline\" treatment protocol where past major physical/emotional/psychological traumas from the past to present are treated. Another important feature of Heilkunst is the treatment of chronic miasms. Chronic miasms are inherited diseases from past generations that manifest particular symptoms in the person. For instance, a child with [autism](https://epidemicanswers.org/symptoms_and_diagnoses/autism-spectrum-disorder/) may have many obsessive compulsive symptoms or have [PANS/PANDAS](https://epidemicanswers.org/pans-pandas/). A syphilitic miasm may be very helpful in attenuating these symptoms. However, keep in mind that many children with autism are so sensitive that they may not be able to tolerate the healing reactions of Heilkunst homeopathy without some advanced preparation in detoxifying the body.
