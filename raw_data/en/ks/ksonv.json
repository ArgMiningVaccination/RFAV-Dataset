This work began by identifying a conceptual model ofsediment inputs, processes and outputs (Figure 3). For ease of assessment the Broads area was split into management units (Appendix 4). Sediment inputs vary between each unit dependent upon theprocesses operating across the river catchment. Across the catchment, thedominant sediment inputs are from headwaters (mainly from agricultural sources),highways, and bank erosion (Figure 4), with the balance varying across time and space. In the case of the headwater inputs, the conclusions of the desk based study provide the Authority with a clear justification for its support of land managementpolicies and initiatives, such as Catchment Sensitive Farming and EnvironmentalStewardship schemes. Through their aims to tackle diffuse pollution, these helpto improve water quality and reduce the level of sediment entering the system. Bank erosion is a key sediment source that was recognised following investigations in the 1980s (Hey et al) and, whilst many initiatives have beenundertaken by the Authority in the past (for example the introduction of SpeedLimit byelaws to reduce wash), further measures including enforcement patrolsand speed limit compliance monitoring are identified. Erosion protectionmeasures have also been installed over extensive areas, and scrub clearance and riverbank restoration programmes have been carried out with the support oflandowners. All of these are important to prevent bank erosion and consequentlyreduce sediment inputs.

Sediment derived from headwater areas andbank erosion appear to be the major sources, although the magnitude of tidaland algal inputs is currently unknown. Sediment deposition, measured fromsediment cores, in broads connected to the river network indicates lowersedimentation than estimated total sediment input rates. This is expected as riverchannel sedimentation is not included in the deposition estimate. However, thecomparable rates of sedimentation and inputs support the validity of theseestimates. Throughout the Broads system sediment has been accumulating at a rate far in excess of natural sedimentation for at least the past 100 years. Nutrientenrichment, changes in agricultural practices, intensive boating activity in the mid-late 20th century and the decline in traditional bankside management, haveall resulted in a backlog of sediment to be removed. The dredging output volume has been prepared from a review of the last 50 years of dredging records and current programmes. These show that current dredging(approximately 42,500 m 3for 2006, 1989-2006 average of 46,000 m3per year)) is exceeding maximum sediment annual inputs of 24,000 m3. However, the backlog of sediment still contained within the system means that enhanced levelsof dredging will need to be continued until such time as the backlog is cleared(see Section 6) and a balance between inputs and outputs is restored. Whereas dredging volumes are assessed, this study does not attempt to quantify tidal outputs. Sediment movement within estuaries is complex and there is nosediment transport model available for the Broads. In any event, sedimentmovement is likely to be episodic, relying on increased energy through storms orsurge tides. Overall, the range of semi-quantative sediment inputs and outputs indicates that the objective to balance sediment inputs by outputs should be achievable and is currently exceeded. The major barrier to delivery of Waterway Specifications is the existing accumulated sediment already within the system.Sediment outputs12 Sediment Management Strategy 20073 Baseline data 3.2Sediment characterisation survey Spreading dredgings to agricultural land at Hickling The sediment characterisation survey was undertaken in 2004. A total of 66 samples were taken at approximately 2 km intervals throughout the Broadsrepresenting a wide range of bed materials (see Figure 6). The samples wereanalysed for contaminants, nutrients and physical characteristics. More recentsurvey information is routinely updated into the Sediment Characterisationdatabase. In the future, material may need to be resampled in order to accurately characterise it as inert, non-hazardous or hazardous waste. In addition, due toexpected changes in the legislation, the A, B, C classification and the disposalroutes shown in Figure 5 may no longer be appropriate (Beckwith 1998).

The depths of isolated waterbodies have been separately assessed using various techniques, including hydrographic survey (Trinity Broads and Fritton Lakeundertaken by Northumbrian Water in 2006), lead line (Barnby, Little, Upton LittleBroads commissioned by the Broads Authority in 2005-06) and expert knowledgefrom site managers and owners. These data are not complete for all isolatedwaterbodies and will be updated as further surveys are undertaken. Repeat surveys will be completed, with one river valley completed annually, programmed over a 5-year period to cover the entire system. The information will be used to update the Removal Tables (Action Plan), provide monitoring forwaterway specification (Section 4) compliance and discharge the BroadsAuthority obligations under the Broads Safety Management System hydrographicsurveying "}
