Listing a study does not mean it has been evaluated by the U.S. Federal Government. Read our | |ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00973284| | | Recruitment Status : Completed First Posted : September 9, 2009 Last Update Posted : August 8, 2017 - Study Details [Tabular View](/ct2/show/record/NCT00973284) [No Biological: Norwalk virus||Phase 1 Phase 2| The drug being tested in this study is called intranasal Norwalk virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine. Norwalk VLP vaccine is being tested to prevent viral acute gastroenteritis (AGE). This study will look at the illness rate of AGE in people who are administered the Norwalk VLP vaccine. The study enrolled 98 patients and was conducted in 2 stages: the Vaccination Stage and the Challenge Stage. In the Vaccination Stage participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Norwalk VLP Vaccine (100 \u00b5g VLP) intranasally - Placebo (dummy inactive powder) - this is a powder that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient During the Challenge Stage participants were administered live Norwalk virus and were monitored for AGE. This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study was up to 29 weeks Participants made multiple visits to the clinic and were contacted by telephone 6 months after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. |Study in Healthy Adults of Intranasal Norwalk Virus-like Particle Vaccine in Experimental Human Norwalk Virus Infection| |Actual Study Start Date :||August 4, 2009| |Actual Primary Date :||April Virus-like Particle (VLP) Vaccine 100 \u00b5g, dry powder, intranasally using a delivery device with a puff of air, 50 \u00b5g in each nostril, on Days 0 and 21 in the Vaccination Stage. Norwalk Virus, 48 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) units, solution, orally, on Day 42 in the Challenge Stage. | Biological: Norwalk VLP vaccine | Norwalk VLP vaccine dry powder Biological: Norwalk virus Norwalk virus solution | Placebo Comparator: Placebo | Norwalk VLP placebo-matching vaccine, dry powder, intranasally using a delivery device with a puff of air, 50 \u00b5g in each nostril, on Days 0 and 21 in the Vaccination Stage. Norwalk Virus, 48 RT-PCR units, solution, orally, on Day 42 in the Challenge Stage. | Biological: mannitol and sucrose | Mannitol and sucrose as placebo-matching Norwalk VLP Vaccine dry powder Biological: Norwalk virus Norwalk virus solution - Percentage of Participants with Viral Acute Gastroenteritis (AGE) [ Time Frame: 7 Days Post-Challenge ] Viral AGE was a composite endpoint for the analysis of clinical illness and was defined as meeting one or more definitions of Norwalk Virus Infection and one or more of the definitions of AGE. Norwalk Virus Infection: - PAN-Immunoglobulin (Ig) Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for anti-Norwalk Virus Antibody IgM, IgG and IgA, 4-fold rise in titer in serum on Challenge Day 30 compared to Pre-Challenge. - Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), a single positive post-challenge stool sample. - Norwalk Virus Antigen, a single positive post-challenge stool sample. Acute Gastroenteritis: ->200 grams of watery feces in 24-hour collection that immediately takes the shape of the container. - Vomiting and watery feces 200 grams on the same or consecutive days. - One vomiting episode plus one of the following symptoms: abdominal cramps or pains, nausea, bloating, loose feces, fever 99.7\u00b0 Fahrenheit, or myalgia on the same or consecutive days. - Percentage of Participants with Norwalk Virus Infection Anytime Post Challenge [ Time Frame: Up to 30 Days Post-Challenge ] Norwalk Virus Infection was defined as meeting one or more of the following criteria: - Norwalk Virus Antigen, a single positive post-challenge stool sample. - Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), a single positive post-challenge stool sample. - PAN-Immunoglobulin (Ig) Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay for anti-Norwalk Virus Antibody IgM, IgG and IgA, 4-fold rise in titer in serum on Challenge Day 30 compared to Pre-Challenge. - Severity of Viral AGE using the Modified Vesikari Scale [ Time Frame: Up to 30 Days Post-Challenge ]Vesikari Scoring System assesses the following symptoms: duration of diarrhea (days), maximum number of diarrheal stools/24 hours, duration of vomiting (days), maximum number of vomiting episodes/24 hours, fever and dehydration. Since the typical inpatient phase was four days in length, the duration of diarrhea scoring was modified to fit this time frame. Modified Vesikari Scale Total Score=17. Higher numbers are worse. - Duration of Viral AGE Among Challenged Participants [ Time Frame: Up to 30 Days Post-Challenge ]Duration of symptoms was determined by a blinded committee review of each participant's symptoms. Participants not ill are included in the calculations with a duration=0. - Percentage of Participants with Norwalk Virus Antigen Detected in the Stool [ Time Frame: Days 1 thru 4, 7, 21 and 30 in the Challenge Stage ]Stool samples were collected following challenge with Norwalk Virus. A positive test for antigen in post challenge stool sample was considered evidence of Norwalk Virus infection. - Percentage of Participants with Seroconversion in Serum Anti-Norwalk Virus [ Time Frame: Pre-Challenge to 30 Days Post-Challenge ]Seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold rise in Pan-Ig ELISA Assay (Combined IgG + IgA + IgM) from Pre-Challenge to Day 30 Post Challenge. - Percentage of Participants with Norwalk RT-PCR Positive Titer in Stool Anytime Post Challenge [ Time Frame: Days 1 thru 4, 7, 21 and 30 in the Challenge Stage ]RT-PCR was carried out to detect Norwalk Virus RNA in stool samples. A single positive test was taken as evidence of a Norwalk Virus infection. - Percentage of Participants with Any Local Intranasal Symptoms during the Vaccination Stage [ Time Frame: 7 Days Post Dose 1 and 2 ]Local symptoms included nasal stuffiness, nasal itching, nasal pain/discomfort, blood tinged nasal mucus and nose bleed. - Percentage of Participants with Any Systemic Solicited Symptoms Anytime Post-Challenge [ Time Frame: Up to 21 Days Post-Challenge ]Systemic signs or symptoms were defined as headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, malaise, and loss of appetite. - Percentage of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) [ Time Frame: 180 days following the last study vaccination (Up to Day 201) ]A SAE was any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant. - Norwalk PAN-Ig Serum-ELISA Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) [ Time Frame: Pre-Dose 1 and 21 Days Post Dose 1 and Dose 2 ] - Norwalk PAN-Ig Serum-ELISA Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) [ Time Frame: Pre-Dose 1 and 21 Days Post Dose 1 and Dose 2 ]GMFR represents the geometric mean fold rise in antibody at post-dose compared to pre-dose 1. - Percentage of Participants with Norwalk PAN-Ig Serum-ELISA Seroresponse (4-Fold Rise) [ Time Frame: Pre-dose 1 and 21 Days Post Dose 1 and 2 ]4-Fold Rise represents the percentage of participants with at least a 4-Fold Rise in antibody at Day 21 post dose compared to pre-dose 1. - Norwalk IgG Serum-ELISA GMT [ Time Frame: Pre-Dose 1 and 21 Days Post Dose 1 and Dose 2 ] - Norwalk IgG Serum-ELISA GMFR [ Time Frame: Pre-Dose 1 and 21 Days Post Dose 1 and Dose 2 ]GMFR represents the geometric mean fold rise in antibody at post-dose compared to pre-dose 1. - Percentage of Participants with Norwalk IgG Serum-ELISA Seroresponse (4-Fold Rise) [ Time Frame: Pre-Dose 1 and 21 Days Post Dose 1 and 2 ]4-Fold Rise represents the percentage of participants with at least a 4-Fold Rise in antibody at Day 21 post dose compared to pre-dose 1. - Norwalk IgA Serum-ELISA GMT [ Time Frame: Pre-Dose 1 and 21 Days Post Dose 1 and Dose 2 ] - Norwalk IgA Serum-ELISA GMFR [ Time Frame: Pre-Dose 1 and 21 Days Post Dose 1 and Dose 2 ]GMFR represents the geometric mean fold rise in antibody at post-dose compared to pre-dose 1. - Percentage of Participants with Norwalk IgA Serum-ELISA Seroresponse [ Time Frame: Pre-Dose 1 and 21 Days Post Dose 1 and 2 ]4-Fold Rise represents the percentage of participants with at least a 4-Fold Rise in antibody at Day 21 post dose compared to pre-dose 1.
