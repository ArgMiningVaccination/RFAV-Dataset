The liver helps to process and store valuable nutrients from the small intestine, crucial in metabolism, immunity, and overall body performance. Also serving as the body's filter, weeding out the garbage and toxins before passing them onto the rest of the digestive system. When the liver is clean and unburdened by toxins or waste, it can absorb nutrients that it needs from food and pass the rest on down the line quickly. However, from junk food to alcohol, our livers are slowly building up waste over time, just like our house our liver will begin to buildup toxins and become overwhelmed - regular cleaning, or detoxing, will help the liver from becoming overburdened. Our body cannot function properly without a health liver as we need them to be in top-notch shape to perform all our body's necessary functions and plays an integral role in [weight loss](https://agerejuvenation.com/weight-loss/). This is why a flush, cleanse, or detox is so imperative when you're looking to shed some fat. Everything we consume is processed through the liver. The byproducts and toxins in all the food we eat might not pass as easily through the liver if there's a blockage or buildup. These blockages will ultimately throw a big wrench in your body's metabolism, making it harder to remove all the waste that we consume, breathe, or come in contact with on a regular basis. It's important to stay on top of a healthy diet to keep the liver functioning optimally. Switching over from processed foods full of chemicals to fresher options is a great way of improving things long-term. If a jumpstart is what you need and you are really trying to [lose weight](https://agerejuvenation.com/weight-loss/), then a cleanse or detox is the way to go.
