Ofce for the Aging PROPOSED RULE MAKING NO HEARING(S) SCHEDULED Limits on Administrative Expenses and Executive Compensation I.D. No. AGE-34-19-00014-P PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE State Administrative Pro- cedure Act, NOTICE is hereby given of the following proposed rule: Proposed Action: This is a consensus rule making to amend section 6656.5 of Title 9 NYCRR. Statutory authority: Elder Law, section 201(3); Not-for-Prot Corpora- tion Law, section 508; Executive Order No. 38 Subject: Limits on Administrative Expenses and Executive Compensation. Purpose: To bring this rule into compliance with current law in New York State. Text of proposed rule: Section 6656.5. Limits on executive compensation (a) Limits on Executive Compensation. Except if a covered pr ovider has obtained a waiver pursuant to section 6656.6 of this Part , a covered provider as dened in this regulation shall not use State fun ds or State- authorized payments for executive compensation given dire ctly or indirectly to a covered executive in an amount greater than $ 199,000 per annum, provided, however, that the Ofce shall review this gure annu- ally to determine whether adjustment is necessary based on a ppropriate factors and subject to the approval of the Director of the Div ision of the Budget. Commencing on July 1, 2013, the limits on executive compensa- tion pursuant to this Part shall be effective and applicable to each covered provider on the rst day of each covered provider's respecti ve covered reporting period. (b) Except if a covered provider has obtained a waiver pursuant to sec- tion 6656.6 of this Part, [where a covered provider's executive compensa-tion given to a covered executive is greater than $199,000 pe r annum (including not only State funds and State-authorized payme nts but also any other sources of funding), and either: (1) greater than the 75th percentile of that compensation provided to comparable executives in other providers of the same size and within the same program service sector and the same or comparable geographic area as established by a compensation survey identied, provided, or recog- nized by the Ofce and the Director of the Division of the Budget; or (2) was not reviewed and approved by the covered provider's board of directors or equivalent governing body (if such a board or body exists) including at least two independent directors or voting members (or where a duly authorized compensation committee including at least two indepen- dent directors or voting members conducted such review on behalf of the full board, such actions were not reviewed and ratied by such board), or such review did not include an assessment of appropriate com parability data;] then such covered provider shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 6656.8 of this Part. To determine whether a covered provider may be subject to penalties, such provider shall provide, upon r equest by the Ofce or its designee, contemporaneous documentation in a f orm and level of detail sufcient to allow such determination to be made. (c) Program Services Rendered by Covered Executives. The li mit on executive compensation pursuant to this Section shall not b e applied to limit reimbursement with State funds or State-authorized p ayments for reasonable compensation paid to a covered executive for pro gram ser- vices, including but not limited to supervisory services performed to facil- itate the covered provider's program services, rendered by the executive outside of his or her managerial or policy-making duties. Do cumentation of such program services rendered shall be used by the covere d provider to determine that percentage, if any, of the covered executive's compensa- tion that is attributable to program services and that compe nsation shall not be considered in the calculation of his or her executive compensation. Such documentation shall be maintained and provided to the Ofce or its designee upon request. Clinical and program personnel in a h ospital or other entity providing program services, including chairs of departments, heads of service, chief medical ofcers, directors of nursi ng, or similar types of personnel fullling administrative functions that are nevertheless directly attributable to and comprise program services sha ll not be considered covered executives for purposes of limiting the use of State funds or State-authorized payments to compensate them. (d) Covered Providers with Multiple Sources of State Funds o r State- Authorized Payments. If a covered provider receives State funds or State- authorized payments from multiple sources, the provider's compliance with the limits on executive compensation in subdivision (a ) of this sec- tion shall be determined based upon the total amount of such f unding received and the reimbursements received from all sources of State funds or State-authorized payments. As set forth in section 6656. 7 of this Part, the covered provider shall report all of such State funds and State- authorized payments in the form specied by the Ofce or its designee. (e) Subcontractors and Agents of Covered Providers. The limits on ex- ecutive compensation in subdivision (a) and (b) of this sect ion and the reporting requirements in section 6656.7 of this Part shall apply to subcontractors and agents of covered providers if and to the extent that such a subcontractor or agent has received State funds or State-authorized payments from the covered provider to provide program or administrative services during the reporting period and would otherwise meet the deni- tion of a covered provider but for the fact that it has received State funds or State-authorized payments from the covered provider rat her than directly from a governmental agency. A covered provider shall incorporate into its agreement with such a subcontractor or agent the ter ms of these regulations by reference to require and facilitate complia nce. Upon request, covered providers shall promptly report to the funding or authoriz- ing agency the identity of such subcontractors and agents, along with any other information requested by that agency or by the Ofce or its designee. A covered provider shall not be held responsible for a subcon tractor's or agent's failure to comply with these regulations. 1(f) Covered Providers receiving State Funds or State-Autho rized Pay- ments from county or local governments. The Ofce or its designee, rather than the county or local unit of government, shall be responsible for obtain- ing the necessary reporting form and compliance by such covered provid- ers and shall issue guidance to affected county and local gov ernments to set forth the procedures by which the Ofce or its designee shall do so. (g) Other Limits on Executive Compensation. If the contract, grant, or other agreement is subject to more stringent limits on executive compensa- tion, whether through law or contract, such limits shall con trol and shall not be affected by the less stringent limits imposed by these regulations. However, the denition and interpretation of terms in this Part shall not be affected or limited by the denition or interpretation of te rms in other regulations or agreements. (h) A covered provider's contract or other agreement with a covered ex- ecutive agreed to prior to July 1, 2012 shall not be subject to the limits in this section during the term of the contract, except that: (1) Covered providers must apply for a waiver for any contrac ts or agreements with covered executives for executive compensa tion that exceeds or otherwise fails to comply with these regulations if such contracts or agreements extend beyond April 1, 2015; and (2) renewals of such contracts or agreements after the completion of their term must comply with these regulations.

Consensus Rule Making Determination The New York State Ofce for the Aging (NYSOFA) is amending 9 NYCRR 6656.5 by consensus rule as NYSOFA has determined that no person is likely to object to the amendment as proposed becau se the amendment is required to bring the regulatory language into compliance with the decision rendered by the Court of Appeals \"In the Mat ter of LeadingAge New York, Inc., et al., v Nirav Shah, as Commissio ner of Health, et al., and In the Matter of Coalition of New York Stat e Public Health Plans, et al., v New York State Department of Health, et al. Job Impact Statement The New York State Ofce for the Aging has determined that thi s consensus rule will not have a substantial adverse impact on jobs. This consensus rule is required to bring the regulatory language into compli- ance with the decision rendered by the Court of Appeals \"In the Matter of LeadingAge New York, Inc., et al., v Nirav Shah, as Commissio ner of Health, et al., and In the Matter of Coalition of New York Stat e Public Health Plans, et al., v New York State Department of Health, et al. Department of Agriculture and Markets EMERGENCY/PROPOSED RULE MAKING NO HEARING(S) SCHEDULED Spotted Lanternfly (''SL'') I.D. Filing Date: 2019-07-31 Effective Date: 2019-07-31 PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE State Administrative Pro- cedure Act, NOTICE is hereby given of the following action: Proposed Action: Amendment of Part 142 of Title 1 NYCRR. Statutory authority: Agriculture and Markets Law, sections 18, 164 and 167 Finding of necessity for emergency rule: Preservation of general welfare. Specic reasons underlying the nding of necessity: The Spotted Lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) is an insect nonindigenous to the United States. It was rst detected in Berks County, Pennsylvania, in September,2014, and since then has been detected in other counties in Pe nnsylvania and in other states, most recently to Dauphin County in Pennsylvania and Cecil County in Maryland (\"the designated counties\"). The proposed rule will require each person who wants to import, into New York, a n article that originates in a designated county and that is capable of being infested by or with Spotted Lanternfly, to obtain a \"certicate of inspection\" from an appropriate state ofcial, before importation into New York. The proposed rule has been adopted, as an emergency rule, to p rotect the public welfare. The Spotted Lanternfly infests different types of trees, including fruit trees, as well as plants, including grape pl ants and hops plants. Once infested, a tree or plant is deprived of nutrients, is incapable of producing fruit to the extent it had prior to infestation, and is not useful as a source of wood. The proposed rule is designed to prevent the Spotted Lanternfly from entering the State from a designated county a nd thereby jeopardizing its forest-based industries and its fruit-based industries which, in sum, contribute approximately $7 billion to the State's e conomy, annually. Based on the facts and circumstances set forth above, the Dep artment has determined that the immediate adoption of this rule is ne cessary for the preservation of the general welfare and that compliance with 202(1) of the State Administrative Procedure Act would be contrary to the public interest. Subject: Spotted Lanternfly (''SL''). Purpose: To prevent SL-infested articles originating in Dauphin Cou nty, in PA, or Cecil County, in MD, from entering NYS. Text of emergency/proposed rule: Subdivision (a) of section 142.2 of 1 NYCRR is amended to read as follows: (a) In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the counties of Ber ks, Bucks, Carbon, Chester, Dauphin, Delaware, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Monroe, Montgomery, Northampton, Philadelphia, and Schuylkill. Section 142.2 of 1 NYCRR is amended by adding thereto a new subdivi- sion (e) to read as follows: (e) In the State of Maryland, the county of Cecil. This notice is intended: to serve as both a notice of emergency adoption and a notice of proposed rule making. The emergency rule will e xpire October 28, 2019. Text of rule and any required statements and analyses may be obtained from: Christopher Logue, Director, Division of Plant Industry, Agriculture and Markets, 10B Airline Drive, Albany, NY 12235, (518) 457- 2087, email: Christopher.Logue@agriculture.ny.gov Data, views or arguments may be submitted to: Same as above. Public comment will be received until: 60 days after publication of this notice. This rule was not under consideration at the time this agency submitted its Regulatory Agenda for publication in the Register. Regulatory Impact Statement 1. Statutory authority: Section 18 of the Agriculture and Markets Law provides, in pa rt, that the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets (\"Commissioner\") may en- act, amend, and repeal necessary rules which shall provide g enerally for the exercise of the powers and performance of the duties of th e Depart- ment of Agriculture and Markets (\"Department\") as prescrib ed in the Agriculture and Markets Law (\"AML\") and the laws of the State and for the enforcement of their provisions and the provisions of th e rules that have been enacted. Section 164 of the AML provides, in part, that the Commissioner shall take such action as he or she may deem necessary to control or e radicate any injurious insects, noxious weeds, or plant diseases existing within the State. Section 167 of the AML provides, in part, that the Commissioner is au- thorized to make, issue, promulgate and enforce such order, by way of quarantines or otherwise, as he or she may deem necessary or tting to carry out the purposes of AML Article 14. AML Section 167 also provides that the Commissioner may adopt and promulgate such rules an d regula- tions to supplement and give full effect to the provisions of AML Article 14. 2. Legislative objectives: The proposed rule will amend section 142.2 of 1 NYCRR to requi re a person who wants to move a \"regulated article\" in the State that originated from Dauphin County in Pennsylvania, or Cecil County in Mary land, to obtain a certicate of inspection before doing so that indic ates that such article is free of Spotted Lanternfly (\"SLF\") before moving t he regulated article into the State. The proposed rule will further the legislature's objective to help ensure that injurious insects, such as SLF, are not allowed to enter the State. 3. Needs and benets: 1 NYCRR Part 142 currently regulates the movement of articles capable of transporting SLF from certain counties in Pennsylvania, Virginia, andNYS Register/August 21, 2019 Rule Making Activities 2New Jersey, into the State. SLF is an injurious insect that attacks, infests, and destroys the value of hardwood trees of economic signicance, includ- ing Walnut and Porcelain Berry, and hops plants and grape vines. The proposed rule is needed to add the County of Dauphin, in Pennsyl- vania, and the County of Cecil, in Maryland, to the list of cou nties from which regulated articles may not be moved into the State, until determined to be free of SLF; these newly added counties have recently been found to harbor SLF and it is necessary that they be added to such list t o better ensure that the SLF does not enter the State and cause the damage referred to above. 4. Costs: (a) Costs to regulated parties for the implementation of and continuing compliance with the rule: A person who wants to import a \"regu lated article\" into the State of New York that originates from Daup hin County, in Pennsylvania, or Cecil County, in Maryland, will be required to obtain a certicate of inspection from an appropriate State authority, attesting that the article is free of SLF; presently, no authority in either state imposes a fee for the issuance of such a certicate. The proposed rule p rovides that the Department of Agriculture and Markets will recognize a certicate if it indicates, inter alia, that a regulated article has been \"tr eated, fumigated, or processed by an approved method\" so as to be free of SLF; the cost of such treatment, fumigation, or processing is dependent upon the nature of the article being so treated, fumigated, or processed; the extent of infesta- tion, if any; and the treatment, fumigation, or processing p rocedure actu- ally used. (b) Costs to the agency, the state and local governments for t he implementation and continuation of the rule: Local governm ents, the Department of Agriculture and Markets, and the State will no t incur any additional expenses due to the proposed rule. (c) The information, including the sources of such information and the methodology upon which the cost analysis is based: The costs analysis set forth above is based upon observations of the industry and state regulatory agencies. 5. Local government mandates: This rule imposes no mandates upon any county, city, town, vi llage, school district, re district, or other special district. 6. Paperwork: Regulated articles inspected and certied to be free of SLF m oving from Dauphin County or from Cecil County would have to be ac- companied by a certicate of inspection. 7. Duplication: There are no relevant rules or other legal requirements of the Federal or State governments that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this rule. 8. Alternatives: The alternative of no action was considered. However, this option is not feasible, given the fact that SLF has recently been found in D auphin County and in Cecil County and given the threat that SLF poses to the State's forests, agriculture, and tourism industries. As such there does not appear to be any viable alternative to the adoption of the proposed rule. 9. Federal standards: There are no federal standards regulating the movement of ar ticles infested, or capable of being infested, with SLF. 10. Compliance schedule: It is anticipated that regulated parties would be able to comply with the proposed rule immediately. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 1. Effect of rule: The proposed rule will amend 1 NYCRR section 142.2 to require a person who wants to move a \"regulated article\" (that is, an it em that is capable of harboring the invasive insect, Spotted Lanternfly) that originates from Dauphin County, in Pennsylvania, or Cecil County, in Maryland (\"a designated county\"), to obtain a certicate from an appropr iate state regulatory agency, attesting that such article is free of Spotted Lanternfly. It is impossible to determine if, and the number of, small bus inesses that will want to move \"regulated articles\" from a designated county into the State. It is anticipated that no local government would be involved in moving a regulated article from a designated county into the State; as such, this analysis addresses the impact of the proposed rule only upon small businesses. 2. Compliance requirements: Each small business that wants to move a regulated article fr om a designated county (\"a regulated party\") will be required to obtain a certif- icate of inspection to ship a regulated article into the Stat e from a state agency authorized to issue such a certicate or by a person duly-designated by such an agency. 3. Professional services: The proposed rule provides that the Department of Agricultu re and Markets will not recognize a certicate of inspection unless the regulated article to be moved into the State, from a designated county, has beenfound to be free of Spotted Lanternfly or rendered free of that pest by hav- ing been properly treated, fumigated, or processed by an approved method - those procedures could require utilization of a professional service in the event the party still desires to move the regulated article into the State. 4. Compliance costs: A regulated party will need to ensure that the article to be moved from a designated county is free of Spotted Lanternfly or has been tr eated, fumigated, or processed by an approved method to render it fr ee of such pest; the cost of such treatment, fumigation, or processing would be de- pendent upon the nature of the article being so treated, fumi gated, or processed; the extent of the infestation, if any; and the treatment, fumiga- tion, or processing procedure actually used. In order to move a regulated article into the State, a regulated party will need to obtain a certicate of inspection from an appropriate state agency; this service is available from Pennsylvania and Maryland, neither of which imposes a fee therefor. 5. Economic and technological feasibility: Small businesses will be economically and technically able to comply with the proposed rule. The technology exists to render an infested article free of Spotted Lanternfly. Furthermore, a small business th at wants to move a regulated article into the State from a designated cou nty will be able to obtain a certicate of inspection from Pennsylvania or Maryland, attesting that the article is free of Spotted Lanternfly, at no charge. 6. Minimizing adverse impact: The Department has designed the proposed rule to minimize ad verse economic impact on small businesses. Spotted Lanternfly has, recently, been found in Dauphin County and in Cecil County,. The proposed rule is designed to ensure that S potted Lanternfly does not enter the State from those counties and, thereby, have a negative impact upon the State's agriculture and tourism industry which consist, in large part, of small businesses; the proposed rule could not have been designed any differently and still have adequately imp lemented its objective. 7. Small business and local government participation: 1 NYCRR Part 142 was originally made effective on September 1 9, 2018. Prior to that date, the Department informed a number of organiza- tions, consisting in part of small businesses, of its intent to promulgate the proposed rule; such organizations consisted of the Empire S tate Forest Products Association, the Invasive Species Advisory Committee, the New York State Turfgrass Association, the New York Farm Bureau, the New York State Trucking Association, and the Catskill Regional Invasive Spe- cies Partnership. The Department received input from those organizations, none of whom objected to requiring importers of regulated ar ticles from counties in other states, known to harbor Spotted Lanternfly, to obtain cer- ticates, prior to importation, attesting that such activi ties were free of Spotted Lanternfly. Rural Area Flexibility Analysis 1. Type and estimated numbers of rural areas: The proposed rule will amend 1 NYCRR section 142.2 to require a person who wants to move a \"regulated article\" (that is, an it em that is capable of harboring the invasive insect, Spotted Lanternfly) that originates from Dauphin County, in Pennsylvania, or Cecil County, in Maryland, (\"a designated county\") to obtain a certicate from an appropriate state regula- tory agency, attesting that such article is free of Spotted Lanternfly. It is impossible to determine if residents of rural areas will themselves import \"regulated articles\" from a designated county into the State and, if so, the number of residents of such areas who will want to do so. 2. Reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirem ents; and professional services: Each resident of a rural area who imports a regulated article from a designated county into the State will be required to obtain a certicate of inspection from a state agency authorized to issue such a certicate or by a person duly-designated by such an agency. 3. Costs: The proposed rule will require that a regulated article may not be moved into the State from Dauphin County or Cecil County unless it h as been inspected and a certicate of inspection has been issued that indicates the article is free of Spotted Lanternfly; this service is availa ble from Pennsylvania and Maryland and neither state imposes a fee therefor. The proposed rule will require that the Department of Agricu lture and Markets (\"Department\") recognize a certicate of inspecti on only if the regulated article has been found to be free of Spotted Lanter nfly. If a regulated article has come into contact with Spotted Lanternfly, this certi- cation can be made only if the article has been properly trea ted, fumigated, or processed by an approved method - the cost of th ese procedures would depend upon the nature of the article being so treated, fumigated, or processed; the extent of infestation, if any; and the treat- ment, fumigation, or processing procedure actually used. 4. Minimizing adverse impact: In conformance with State Administrative Procedure Act sec tion 202-NYS Register/August 21, 2019 Rule Making Activities 3bb(2), the Department has designed the rule to minimize adve rse eco- nomic impact on persons and businesses located in rural areas. If Spotted Lanternfly were to become endemic in the State, residents of, and busi- nesses in, rural areas would suffer disproportionally, bot h economically and otherwise. 5. Rural area participation: 1 NYCRR Part 142 was originally made effective on September 1 9, 2018. Prior to that date, the Department informed a number of organiza- tions, consisting in part of businesses located in rural areas, of its intent to promulgate 1 NYCRR Part 142; such organizations consisted o f the Empire State Forest Products Association, the Invasive Spe cies Advisory Committee, the New York State Turfgrass Association, the New York Farm Bureau, the New York State Trucking Association, and the Cat skill Regional Invasive Species Partnership. The Department received input from these organizations, none of whom objected to requiring importers of regulated articles from counties in other states, known to harbor Spotted Lanternfly, to obtain certi cates, prior to importation, attesting that such articles were free of Spotted Lanternfly. Job Impact Statement The proposed rule will amend Part 142 to 1 NYCRR, requiring th at a person who wants to move a designed article from Dauphin Coun ty, in Pennsylvania, or Cecil County, in Maryland, into New York State to obtain a \"certicate of inspection\" that indicates that the article is free of \"Spot- ted Lanternfly\", before doing so. Spotted Lanternfly is an inv asive insect that can cause serious damage to grapes, hops, and various types of trees including fruit trees and deciduous trees. The proposed rule will not have an adverse impact on jobs or employ- ment opportunities and, in fact, will likely aid in protecti ng jobs and employment opportunities now and in the future. Forest rela ted activities in New York State provide employment for approximately 70,000 people. Of that number, 55,000 jobs are associated with the wood-bas ed forest economy, including manufacturing. The forest-based econo my generates payrolls of more than $2 billion. New York State's fruit indu stry is the largest on the east coast excluding citrus. New York State's fruit crop is valued at over $400 million annually. The two largest components of that is apples and grapes. New York State ranks 2nd nationally in production of apples and ranks 3rd nationally in the production of grapes. New York State's apple industry has 694 commercial apple orchards th at directly employ 10,000 people and indirectly employ 7,500 people. Ne w York State produces 29.5 million bushels of apples per year. The N ew York State grape and wine industry has 1,631 vineyards and over 400 wineries. New York State produces over 175 million bottles of wine annu ally. The grape, wine, and juice industry generates over $4.8 billion annually. The New York State tourism industry employs over 780,000 people generating $64 billion in direct sales and $34.6 billion in salary. Implementation of the proposed rule will aid in preventing t he further spread of this pest into the State from Dauphin County or from Cecil County. A spread of the infestation would have very adverse e conomic consequences. Additionally, a spread of the infestation could result in the imposition of more restrictive quarantines by the federal g overnment, other states and foreign countries, which would have a detrimental impact upon the nancial well-being of these industries. By helping to prevent the spread of Spotted Lanternfly, the pr oposed rule helps prevent such adverse economic consequences, whi ch protects the jobs and employment opportunities associated with the State's nursery, fruit growing, craft beverage, tourism, and forestry industries.

No. 727 Filing Date: 2019-08-02 Effective Date: 2019-08-03 PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE State Administrative Pro- cedure Act, NOTICE is hereby given of the following action: Action taken: Amendment of section 64.7 of Title 8 NYCRR. Statutory authority: Education Law, sections 207(not subdivided), 6504(not subdivided), 6507(2), 6902(1), 6909(5) and (7) Finding of necessity for emergency rule: Preservation of public health and general welfare. Specic reasons underlying the nding of necessity: The proposed amendment is necessary to conform the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education to current immunization standards in order to e nhance the protection of the public health by expanding access to immunizations for infants, children and adults, as permitted by section 6909 of the Education Law, effective for the 2018-2019 influenza season and curren t measles outbreaks in New York State. Section 6909 of the Education La w allows registered professional nurses to administer immunizatio ns pursuant to non-patient specic orders issued by a licensed physician o r a certied nurse practitioner in accordance with the Regulations of th e Commis- sioner of Education. The proposed amendment will authorize more registered professional nurses to immunize infants, child ren and adultsNYS Register/August 21, 2019 Rule Making Activities 7against additional infectious diseases, in accordance wit h current recom- mendations from the United States Centers for Disease Contr ol and Prevention (CDC). According to the CDC, the best way to prevent seasonal influenza is to get vaccinated every year. In 2018, seasonal influenza reach ed epidemic proportions in New York State and posed a serious health risk for children and those with compromised immune systems or chronic medica l conditions. Additionally, there are currently two measles outbreaks in New York State communities with very low vaccination rates. Thus, it is critical to make such immunizing agents available to as many children and infants as possible to protect them from this disease. Accor ding to the CDC, measles is a highly contagious virus. In some cases, it c an cause serious health problems, especially in infants and young children. Pregnant women with measles are also at greater risk of having prematu re or low- birth-rate babies. Thus, the Department recommends that, in order to bet- ter address these serious health risks to New Yorkers, the Re gulations of the Commissioner of Education be amended to expand access to seasonal influenza and measles vaccines for infants, children and adu lts effective beginning with the current influenza season and measles outb reaks. Al- lowing more registered professional nurses to administer s easonal influenza and measles vaccines to infants, children and adults pursuant to a non-patient specic order and protocol will protect more p eople from these potentially harmful and sometimes fatal diseases. The proposed rule was adopted as an emergency action at the Ma rch 11-12, 2019 Regents meeting and became effective March 12, 2019. After the publication of the proposed rule in the State Register on March 27, 2019, Department staff discovered that section 64.7(a)(1) (i)(c) uses the term \"vaccines\", instead of the more appropriate term \"immu nizing agents,\" which includes both vaccines and immunoglobulin drugs. Replac- ing the term \"vaccines\" with the term \"immunizing agents\" wi ll allow registered professional nurses to execute non-patient spe cic orders for administering vaccines and/or immunoglobulin drugs to com bat an outbreak or epidemic. Thereafter, at the June 3-4, 2019 Regents meeting, the March 2019 emergency action was repealed effective June 4, 2019, and the revised proposed rule, which replaced the term \"vacc ines\" with the term \"immunizing agents\", was adopted on an emergency ba sis (second emergency), to ensure that the emergency rule, as revised, remains continuously in effect until the effective date of its adopt ion as a perma- nent rule. A Notice of Emergency Adoption and Revised Rule Making was published in the State Register on June 19, 2019 for an additional 45-day public comment period. Because the Board of Regents meets at xed intervals, the ear liest the proposed amendment can be presented for regular (non-emergency) adop- tion, after expiration of the required 60-day public commen t period provided for in the State Administrative Procedure Act (SAP A) section 202(1) and (5), would be the September 9-10, 2019 Regents mee ting. Furthermore, pursuant to SAPA section 203(1), the earliest effective date of the proposed amendment, if adopted at the September meeti ng, would be September 25, 2019, the date a Notice of Adoption would be published in the State Register. However, the June 2019 emergency rule will expire on August 2, 2019. Therefore, a third emergency action is necessary at the July 2019 Regents meeting for preservation of the public health and general welfare in order to enable the State Education Department to immediately imple- ment the revised proposed rule, so that registered professional nurses can immunize infants, children and adults against additional i nfectious diseases, including influenza and measles, pursuant to non-patient specic orders prescribed by a licensed physician or a certied nurse practitioner, during the 2018-2019 influenza season and the current measles outbreaks in New York State. It is anticipated that the revised proposed rule will be presented for per- manent adoption at the September 9-10, 2019 Regents meeting , which is the rst scheduled meeting after the expiration of the 45-day public com- ment period prescribed in the State Administrative Procedu re Act for revised rule makings.

The term \"immunizing ag ents\" includes both vaccines and immunoglobulin drugs. Thus, rep lacing the term \"vaccines\" with the term \"immunizing agents\" will allow registered professional nurses to execute non-patient specic orders for administer- ing vaccines and/or immunoglobulin drugs to combat an outbr eak or epidemic, which furthers the intent of the proposed amendme nts to the regulation.

EMERGENCY RULE MAKING Certication of Manufacturers and Wholesalers for Export Purposes I.D. No. Filing No. 728 Filing Date: 2019-08-02 Effective Date: 2019-08-05 PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE State Administrative Pro- cedure Act, NOTICE is hereby given of the following action: Action taken: Amendment of section 63.6 of Title 8 NYCRR. Statutory authority: Education Law, sections 207(not subdivided), 6504(not subdivided), 6507(2), 6801(1), 6802(7), (16), (1 8), (21) and 6808(4) Finding of necessity for emergency rule: Preservation of public health and general welfare. Specic reasons underlying the nding of necessity: The proposed amendment to the Regulations of the Commissioner of Educati on is nec- essary, so that the Department can immediately resume perfo rming the function of issuing free sale certicates to New York State r egistered manufacturers or wholesalers seeking to sell their drugs and/or devices in foreign countries. Education Law \u00a7 6808(4) requires that in order to sell drugs and/or devices in foreign countries, a New York State manufacturer or wholesaler must, inter alia, obtain a certicate from the Department that veries that it is currently registered as a manufacturer, w holesaler- repacker and/or wholesaler of drugs and/or devices and that it offers the drugs and/or devices listed on the certicate for sale in New York State. These certicates are commonly referred to as \"free sale certicates.\" Currently, paragraph (6) of subdivision (c) of section 63.6 of the Regula- tions of the Commissioner of Education states that \"[a]ny re gistered manufacturer or wholesaler may be issued a certicate by the executive secretary of the State Board of Pharmacy, authenticating said registration and identifying the specied drugs and/or devices as articles regularly of- fered for sale in New York. . . .\" However, since departure of the former executive secretary of the State Board of Pharmacy in January 2019, the Department has been un able to issue any free sale certicates because 8 NYCRR \u00a7 63.6(c)(6) only permits the executive secretary to do so. Therefore, the proposed am endment paragraph (6) of subdivision (c) of section 63.6 of the Regul ations of the Commissioner of Education is designed to address this issue by permitting either the executive secretary or a designee of the Commissioner of Educa- tion to issue these certicates. The proposed rule was adopted as an emergency action at the May 2019 Regents meeting and became effective May 7, 2019. The May emergency rule will expire on August 4, 2019. A second emergency adoption is neces- sary to ensure that the emergency rule adopted at the May 2019 Regents meeting remains continuously in effect until the effective date of its adop- tion as a permanent rule. Since the Board of Regents meets at xed intervals, the earli est theNYS Register/August 21, 2019 Rule Making Activities 10proposed rule can be presented for adoption, after expirati on of the required 60-day comment period provided for in the State Administrative Procedure Act (SAPA) sections 201(1) and (5), would be the Se ptember 9-10, 2019 Regents meeting. Furthermore, pursuant to SAPA s ection 203(1), the earliest effective date of the proposed rule, if adopted at the September meeting, would be September 25, 2019 the date the N otice of Adoption would be published in the State Register. Therefore, emergency action is necessary at the July 2019 Re gents meeting for the preservation of the public health and genera l welfare so that the Department can issue free sale certicates to New Yo rk State registered manufacturers or wholesalers seeking to sell their drugs and/or devices in foreign countries. Subject: Certication of Manufacturers and Wholesalers for Export Purposes. Purpose: To clarify who may issue free sale certicates to New York State registered manufacturers or wholesalers. Text of emergency rule: Paragraph (6) of subdivision (c) of section 63.6 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education is amend ed, as follows: (6) Certication of manufacturers and wholesalers for expo rt purposes. Any registered manufacturer or wholesaler may be issued a cer- ticate by the executive secretary of the State Board of Phar macy[,] or a designee of the Commissioner of Education, authenticating said registra- tion and identifying the specied drugs and/or devices as articles regularly offered for sale in New York. The fee for each certicate shall be $5. This notice is intended to serve only as a notice of emergency adoption. This agency intends to adopt the provisions of this emergenc y rule as a permanent rule, having previously submitted to the Department of State a notice of proposed rule making, I.D. No. EDU-21-19-00007-E P, Issue of May 22, 2019. The emergency rule will expire September 30, 2019. Text of rule and any required statements and analyses may be obtained from: Kirti Goswami, Education Department, 89 Washington Avenue Albany, NY 12234, (518) 474-6400, email: legal@nysed.gov Regulatory Impact Statement 1. STATUTORY AUTHORITY: Section 207 of the Education Law grants general rulemaking authority to the Board of Regents to carry into effect the laws and polic ies of the State relating to education. Section 6504 of the Education Law authorizes the Board of Regents to supervise the admission to and regulation of the practice of the professions. Paragraph (a) of subdivision (2) of section 6507 of the Education Law authorizes the Commissioner of Education to promulgate reg ulations in administering the admission to and the practice of the professions. Education Law section 6801 denes the practice of the profes sion of pharmacy. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subdivision (16) of section 6802 of the Educa- tion Law denes the term device. Paragraphs (a) through (d) of subdivision (7) of section 680 2 of the Education Law denes the term drugs. Subdivision (18) of section 6802 of the Education Law denes the term wholesaler. Subdivision (21) of section 6802 of the Education Law denes the term manufacturer. Subdivision (4) of section 6808 of the Education Law establi shes the registration requirements for wholesalers and manufacturers. 2. LEGISLATIVE OBJECTIVES: The proposed amendment carries out the legislative intent o f the aforementioned statutes that the Board of Regents and the De partment regulate the admission to and the practice in the professions. Education Law \u00a7 6808(4) requires that any drug manufacturer or whole- saler of drugs be registered with the Department prior to off ering such drugs and/or devices for sale in New York. Additionally, if such New York State registered manufacturer or wholesaler wishes to sell drugs and/or de- vices in foreign countries the registered manufacturer or wholesaler must, inter alia, obtain a certicate from the Department that ver ies that it is currently registered as a manufacturer, wholesaler-repacker and/or whole- saler of drugs and/or devices and that it offers the drugs and /or devices listed on the certicate for sale in New York State. These cer ticates are commonly referred to as \"free sale certicates.\" To obtain such authorization, a registered manufacturer or wholesaler must submit an application for a free sale certicate to the New York State Board of Pharmacy Ofce (pharmacy board ofce) with the required fee. The application requires the manufacturer or wholesaler to provide, among other things, its name and address; identify the type of esta blishment (manufacturer, wholesaler-repacker and/or wholesaler); the name of the country in which the certicate will be used; the name of each drug and/or device (product) it intends to export; and attach copies of t he labels for each product. If the product will be sold under a different na me in the identied foreign country, the English name under which the product issold in New York State must also appear on the label. Finally, the products for which the entity seeks the free sale certicate must appear in a domes- tic catalog or price list that clearly indicates that they are offered for sale in New York State, for the Department to consider issuing a fr ee sale certicate. Currently, paragraph (6) of subdivision (c) of section 63.6 of the Regula- tions of the Commissioner of Education provides that \"[a]ny registered manufacturer or wholesaler may be issued a certicate by the executive secretary of the State Board of Pharmacy, authenticating said registration and identifying the specied drugs and/or devices as articles regularly of- fered for sale in New York. . . .\" The pharmacy board ofce receives approximately 20 free sale certi- cate applications a year. Currently, there are three pendin g applications. However, since the departure of the former executive secret ary of the State Board of Pharmacy in January 2019, the Department has b een un- able to issue any free sale certicates because the regulation only permits the executive secretary issue such certicates. The propos ed amendment to paragraph (6) of subdivision (c) of section 63.6 of the Reg ulations of the Commissioner of Education is designed to address this issue by permit- ting either the executive secretary or a designee of the Comm issioner of Education to issue these certicates. 3. NEEDS AND BENEFITS: The proposed amendment to paragraph (6) of subdivision (c) of section 63.6 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education permits either the executive secretary of the State Board of Pharmacy or a de signee of the Commissioner of Education to issue free sale certicates to registered manufacturers and wholesalers seeking to export drugs and/ or devices. Since the departure of the former executive secretary of the State Board of Pharmacy in January 2019, the Department has been unable to i ssue any free sale certicates because the current regulation only permits the execu- tive secretary issue such certicates. By permitting a designee of the Com- missioner of Education to issue free sale certicates in addition to the ex- ecutive secretary of the State Board of Pharmacy, the Department will be able to issue these certicates even when the executive secr etary is un- available to do so or when the position is vacant, as it is currently. 4. COSTS: The proposed amendment permits a designee of the Commission er of Education to issue free sale certicates in addition to the executive secre- tary of the State Board of Pharmacy; it imposes no costs on any parties. (a) Costs to State government. There are no additional costs to State government. (b) Costs to local government. There are no additional costs to local government. (c) Costs to private regulated parties. There are no additio nal costs to private regulated parties. (d) Costs to the regulatory agency. There are no additional costs to the State Education Department. 5. LOCAL GOVERNMENT MANDATES: The proposed amendment does not impose any program, service, duty, or responsibility on local governments. 6. PAPERWORK: The proposed amendment imposes no new forms, reporting requ ire- ments, or other recordkeeping or paperwork requirements. 7. DUPLICATION: The proposed amendment does not duplicate any other existing State or federal requirements. 8. ALTERNATIVES: The proposed amendment to paragraph (6) of subdivision (c) of section 63.6 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education aro se out of concerns that Department would be unable to issue free sale certicates if, as presently is the case, there is a vacancy in the executive secretary of the State Board of Pharmacy position or in instances when the executive sec- retary is unavailable to issue them. There are no signicant alternatives to the proposed amendment and none were considered. 9. FEDERAL STANDARDS: No Federal standards apply to the subject of this proposed rule making. The Federal government does not regulate who, at the State level, can is- sue free sale certicates. Since there are no applicable fed eral standards, the proposed amendment does not exceed any minimum federal standards for the same or similar subject areas. 10. COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE: If adopted at the May 2019 Regents meeting, the emergency rul e will become effective on May 7, 2019. It is anticipated that regul ated parties will be able to comply with the proposed amendment by the effective date. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The purpose of the proposed amendment is to permit either the execu- tive secretary of the State Board of Pharmacy or a designee of the Com- missioner of Education to issue free sale certicates to reg istered manufacturers and/or wholesalers seeking to export drugs and/or devices. Education Law \u00a7 6808(4) requires that any drug manufacturer or whole-NYS Register/August 21, 2019 Rule Making Activities 11saler of drugs be registered with the Department prior to off ering such drugs and/or devices for sale in New York. Additionally, if such New York State registered manufacturer or wholesaler wishes to sell drugs and/or de- vices in foreign countries the registered manufacturer or wholesaler must, inter alia, obtain a certicate, commonly referred to as \"fr ee sale certi- cates,\" from the Department that veries that it is currently registered as a manufacturer, wholesaler-repacker and/or wholesaler of d rugs and/or de- vices and that it offers the drugs and/or devices listed on the certicate for sale in New York State. Currently, paragraph (6) of subdivision (c) of sec- tion 63.6 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Educatio n provides that \"[a]ny registered manufacturer or wholesaler may be issued a certi- cate by the executive secretary of the State Board of Pharmacy, authenti- cating said registration and identifying the specied drugs and/or devices as articles regularly offered for sale in New York. . . .\" The pharmacy board ofce receives approximately 20 free sale certi- cate applications a year. Currently, there are three pendin g applications. However, since the departure of the former executive secret ary of the State Board of Pharmacy in January 2019, the Department has b een un- able to issue any free sale certicates because the regulation only permits the executive secretary issue such certicates. The propos ed amendment to paragraph (6) of subdivision (c) of section 63.6 of the Reg ulations of the Commissioner of Education is designed to address this issue by permit- ting either the executive secretary or a designee of the Comm issioner of Education to issue these certicates. The proposed rule does not impose any new reporting, recordk eeping, or other compliance requirements on local governments or ha ve any adverse economic impact on small businesses or local govern ments. Because it is evident from the nature of the proposed amendme nt that it will not adversely affect small businesses or local governm ents, no afr- mative steps were needed to ascertain that fact and none were taken. Ac- cordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis for small busi nesses and local governments is not required, and one has not been prepared.

Neither the current regulation nor the proposed amendment p rovides any exceptions from these free sale certicate requirements for registered manufacturers and wholesalers located in rural areas. Thus , the proposed amendment does not impact entities in rural areas of New York State because all New York State registered manufacturers and who lesalers must comply with the same requirements. Accordingly, no fur ther steps were needed to ascertain the impact of the proposed amendmen t on enti- ties in rural areas and none were taken. Thus, a rural flexibility analysis is not required, and one has not been prepared. Job Impact Statement It is not anticipated that the propose rule will impact jobs o r employ- ment opportunities. This is because the proposed amendment permits ei- ther the executive secretary of the State Board of Pharmacy or a designee of the Commissioner of Education to issue free sale certica tes to registered manufacturers and/or wholesalers seeking to ex port drugs and/or devices. Education Law \u00a7 6808(4) requires that any drug manufac- turer or wholesaler of drugs be registered with the Department prior to of-fering such drugs and/or devices for sale in New York. Additi onally, if such New York State registered manufacturer or wholesaler wishes to sell drugs and/or devices in foreign countries the registered ma nufacturer or wholesaler must, inter alia, obtain a certicate, commonly referred to as \"free sale certicates,\" from the Department that veries t hat it is cur- rently registered as a manufacturer, wholesaler-repacker and/or wholesaler of drugs and/or devices and that it offers the drugs and/or devices listed on the certicate for sale in New York State. Currently, paragr aph (6) of subdivision (c) of section 63.6 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education provides that \"[a]ny registered manufacturer or wholesaler may be issued a certicate by the executive secretary of the Stat e Board of Pharmacy, authenticating said registration and identifyi ng the specied drugs and/or devices as articles regularly offered for sale in New York. . . .\" The pharmacy board ofce receives approximately 20 free sale certi- cate applications a year. Currently, there are three pendin g applications. However, since the departure of the former executive secret ary of the State Board of Pharmacy in January 2019, the Department has b een un- able to issue any free sale certicates because the regulation only permits the executive secretary issue such certicates. The propos ed amendment to paragraph (6) of subdivision (c) of section 63.6 of the Reg ulations of the Commissioner of Education is designed to address this issue by permit- ting either the executive secretary or a designee of the Comm issioner of Education to issue these certicates. The proposed amendment will not have a substantial adverse impact on jobs and employment opportunities. Because it is evident from the nature of the proposed amendment that it will not affect job and employment op- portunities, no afrmative steps were needed to ascertain t hat fact and none were taken. Accordingly, a job impact statement is not required and one has not been prepared. Assessment of Public Comment The agency received no public comment.

Assessment of Public Comment The State Board received four public comments in response to its publi- cation of Emergency Adoption and Revised Rulemaking I.D No. SBE-22- 19-00003-EP that amends section 6211. The Board received co mments from the following entities: A Disability Rights Advocacy Organizations Summaries of the comments on the proposal and the Department 's re- sponses thereto are as follows: Comment: ''The NYS BOE proposed early voting communication plan ...fails to include a deadline indicating when a county board of elections ofce must notify eligible voters of the designated early polling places and hours of operations. Voters with disabilities have increas ed barriers ar- ranging transportation to the polls on Election Day. It is ne cessary to provide a deadline whereby a county board of elections must n otify their eligible voters of the designated polling places and hours o f operations. (e.g. No less than 30 days prior to the commencement of any early voting period.)'' Response: The proposed regulations provide that a local ''board of elec- tions shall annually le a copy of the communications plan on or before June 1, except in the rst year of early voting, on or before the rst day of July.''Any communication plan that does not timely inform voters of early voting sites and their dates and hours of operation will be rejected by the State Board.

Each county board of elections may increase in a non-discriminatory manner, the number of voting devices us ed in any specic polling place. If the voter waiting time at an early voting site exceeds thirty minutes the board of elections shall deploy such additional voting equipment, election workers and other resources nec essary to reduce the wait time to less than thirty minutes as soon as possible but no later than the beginning of the next day of early voting. (2) The inspectors in each election district and at each early voting site shall record the number of persons using audio, tactile or pneumatic switch ballot devices. The county board of elections shall furnish additional vot- ing machines equipped with audio, tactile or pneumatic swit ch ballot de- vices when it appears that the number of persons historicall y using such devices warrant additional devices. ([d]e) The State Board of Elections may authorize a reduction in th e number of voting devices and privacy booths provided in these regula- tions upon application of a county board of elections which demonstrates that such a reduction will not create excessive waiting time by voters. The request for such a reduction shall be made by both commissioners, in writ- ing, to the co-executive directors of the state board and shall set forth the rationale being used for the requested reduction. The reque st for such reduction shall be made no later than twenty days before the beginning of the early voting period. (f) Provisions of this section applicable to early voting shall apply in re- lation to any election at which early voting is held pursuant to title VI of article 8 of the election law as enacted by chapter 6 of the laws of 2019.

Statutory authority: Environmental Part 208 will incorporate the new Federal emission guideline for MSW landlls pursuant to 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cf. Purpose: Part 208 controls landll gas emissions by requiring a gas co l- lection and control system. Text of nal rule: Sections 200.1 through 200.8 remain unchanged. Existing Section 200.9, Table 1 is amended to read as follows: Table 1 Regulation Referenced Material Availability [208.8(d)] [40 CFR Part 60 (July 1, 1999)] [64 Federal Register 7463 (Feb. 12, 1999)][*] Table 1 Regulation Referenced Material Availability 208.1(a) Federal Register, Vol 81, No 167, Page 59276 (August 29, 2016)+++ 208.2(a) Federal Register, Vol 81, No 167, Page 59276 (August 29, 2016)+++ 208.2(b) Federal Register, Vol 81, No 167, Page 59276 (August 29, 2016)+++ Existing Section 200.10, Table 2 is amended to read as follows: Table 2Delegated Federal New Source Performance Standards of 40 CFR 60 40 CFR 60 SubpartSource Category Page numbers in July 1, 2013 Edition of 40 CFR 60 unless otherwise cited [Cc] [Municipal Solid Waste Landlls][122-124] Cf Municipal Solid Waste Landlls 81 'Federal Register' 59276 (August 29, 2016) The existing Part 208 is repealed. New Part 208 will be adopte d as follows: Section 208.1 Applicability. The Federal requirements of 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Cf, (see Table 1, section 200.9 of this Title), will apply to existing municip al solid waste (MSW) landlls that have accepted waste after November 8, 19 87 and began construction, reconstruction or modication prior to July 17, 2014. Activities required by or conducted pursuant to a CERCLA, RC RA, or State remedial action are not considered construction, rec onstruction, or modication for purposes of this section.

Revised Regulatory Impact Statement, Regulatory Flexibil ity Analysis, Rural Area Flexibility Analysis and Job Impact Statement The edits made to the express terms do not require any changes to the RIS, RFA, RAFA and JIS. Initial Review of Rule As a rule that requires a RFA, RAFA or JIS, this rule will be ini tially reviewed in the calendar year 2022, which is no later than the 3rd year af- ter the year in which this rule is being adopted. Assessment of Public Comment Comment 1. We have a municipal landll, closed and capped in 1 990 with a geomembrane and an active gas control system that burns the gas in an enclosed flare. Do we have to do anything else under the proposed revi- sions? (Commenter 1) Response to Comment 1: The Department does not have enough infor- mation about the MSW landll in question to properly assess t he ap- plicability of the new regulatory requirements to the facility. Please contact DEC's Division of Air Resources staff in one of our regional o fces (https://www.dec.ny.gov/about/84152.html) to discuss a pplicability of these rules to your particular facility. Comment 2. We agree with the agency's decision to incorporat e the Subpart Cf provisions by reference. At the same time EPA prom ulgated Subpart Cf for existing landlls, it also revised the NSPS at Subpart XXX for new landlls with the intent of maintaining the consistency of the work practice standards imposed under both rules. As such, Subpa rts Cf and XXX contain nearly identical requirements. With incorporations by refer- ence, NYSDEC can be sure that its Subpart Cf State Plan will remain con-NYS Register/August 21, 2019 Rule Making Activities 16sistent with the requirements for new landlls, while appro priately preserving the provisions of Subpart Cf that are specicall y designed for existing sources, such as the applicability provisions and the provisions governing closed landlls. We support the Agency's efforts to maintain that consistency by incorporating Subpart Cf by reference. (Commenter 2) Response to Comment 2: The Department appreciates the commenter's support for the new regulation and agrees with the commenter that incorporation of 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Cf (Subpart Cf) by re ference into revised Part 208 provides the regulatory consistency f or existing landlls and/or landll operators transitioning from Subpart Cf to 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart XXX (Subpart XXX). Comment 3. Since NYDEC proposes to incorporate Subpart Cf pr ovi- sions by reference, the agency should adopt language statin g that future amendments to Subpart Cf carry through to the state rule. To ensure con- sistency with any aspect of Subpart Cf that is incorporated b y reference, NYSDEC should specify that such incorporation encompasses any future changes, additions, or revisions to the federal rule. Where statute may prevent such future incorporation, the agency should consi der streamlin- ing mechanisms that would allow for expedited revisions to P art 208 if and when changes are promulgated to Subpart Cf pursuant to the recently proposed changes or changes arising from industry reconsid eration petitions. (Commenter 2) Response to Comment 3: As the commenter indicated, the Department is prohibited by the State Administrative Procedures Act (S APA) from adopting rules on a prospective basis, including the automa tic incorpora- tion by reference of future federal law changes. Rather, the Department is required to comply with SAPA's rulemaking requirements, in cluding providing the public with notice of all proposed rulemakings as well as an opportunity for review and comment, for each proposed rule. While the adoption of new Part 208 primarily consists of the incorporation by refer- ence of federal emission guideline (EG) requirements under Subpart Cf, any future changes to federal law will require the Department to adhere to state rulemaking requirements in order to adopt those chang es into state law. Comment 4. Any new state regulation and State Plan under Subpart Cf should not take effect until EPA has approved the State Plan. NYSDEC must also leave the current regulations and State Plan ''on- the-books,'' instead of overwriting them with the new Subpart Cf requirements, so that the current requirements can remain effective while the sta te awaits EPA approval of the state's new Subpart Cf rule and Plan. Accordi ngly, NYSDEC should likewise conrm in its revised regulations and new State Plan that Subpart Cf requirements will not take effect until EPA approves the State Plan. Doing so will eliminate the gap in time betwee n the date that new state and federal regulatory requirements become effective, which would otherwise arise while the State Plan is under review at EPA. Subpart Cf itself conrms that compliance is not required until EPA approval. See 40 CFR \u00a7 \u00a7 60.32f, 60.38f(c) (requiring compliance within 30 months af- ter the report that is due 90 days after EPA approval). NYSDEC should align the deadline for compliance with its new Subpart Cf rules and State Plan with the effective date of the EPA approval needed to mak e those requirements federally enforceable. (Commenter 2) Response to Comment 4: The rulemaking process requires that new Part 208 be adopted prior to submitting a State Plan to EPA. New Part 208 will become effective and enforceable in New York regardless of whether EPA approves the State Plan. New York plans to submit a State P lan to EPA which includes identifying new Part 208 as the enforceab le mecha- nism to implement the EG. Comment 5. The state regulations should specify an approval process for design plans. Subpart Cf requires each existing landll to operate pur- suant to a state-approved site-specic design plan for the landll's unique gas collection and control system (GCCS). However, Subpart Cf does not dictate the process through which states must approve those design plans. Since the lack of timely GCCS design plan approval can leave a landll in an untenable position, we ask NYSDEC to include a more denite proce- dure in its state regulations for ensuring the review and res ponse to all design plan submittals will be timely. For example, where NYSDEC staff may be unable to review a submitted design plan within a presc ribed pe- riod of time, we ask NYSDEC to rely upon the required Professi onal Engineer certication of the design plan as a sufcient basis for approving it. We also ask NYSDEC to expressly indicate in its regulatio ns that any alternatives approved under the prior version of the standa rds (Subparts Cc and WWW) will also be approved under the new regulations an d Subpart Cf state plan, including alternative timelines and higher operating values, so that landlls do not need to seek re-approval of every alternative. (Commenter 2) Response to Comment 5: In 2002, the Division of Air Resources (DAR) and the Division of Solid and Hazardous Materials (DS&HM) - n ow called the Division of Materials Management (DMM) - entered into a Memorandum of Responsibilities (MOR) which outlines the responsibili- ties of each Division in the evaluation and approval of designs submittedto the Department for Part 208. Technical staff in the DMM have histori- cally been responsible for landll engineering, including the review of GCCS's, while technical staff in the DAR have expertise in the assessment and modeling of landll gas emission generation and treatme nt system designs, including the evaluation of monitoring systems as sociated with such. DAR and DMM will continue to work together to ensure com pli- ance with the requirements of 6 NYCRR Parts 208 and 360, while maintaining the timely evaluation and approval of design plans according to the MOR. Comment 6. NYSDEC should include an Automatic Rescission Clause. In light of the petitions, court order and pending changes to Subparts AAAA and Cf referenced above, there remains some chance that Subpart Cf could be rescinded by EPA or vacated by a court. In similar c ircum- stances, several states have adopted a provision to conrm t hat federal rules adopted into a state code will no longer be effective under state law if the rules cease to be effective under federal law, and EPA has approved such provisions if written properly. See 81 Fed. Reg.42,587 (June 30, 2016) (Oklahoma); 81 Fed. Reg. 27,382 (May 6, 2016) (Louisia na); 79 Fed. Reg. 22,772 (Apr. 24, 2014) (Colorado). Specically, E PA has ap- proved ''automatic rescission clauses'' if they (1) ensure the public will receive reasonable notice of the rescission, and (2) the res cission will be consistent with EPA's interpretation of the triggering act ion. Based on EPA's prior approvals of automatic rescission clauses, we a sk NYSDEC to include the following provision in its new Subpart Cf rule : If federal legislation, a federal court, or a subsequent nal agency action renders the EPA's Subpart Cf emission guidelines unenforceable in whol e or in part, this rule shall become void to the same extent. (Commenter 2) Response to Comment 6: An \"automatic rescission clause\" wou ld directly conflict with the rulemaking requirements under Ne w York's SAPA. See Response to Comments 3 and 4.

Summary of Revised Regulatory Impact Statement (Full text is posted at the following State website:http://www.dec.ny.gov/regu lations/ propregulations.html#public): The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) is proposing 6 NYCRR Subpart 227-3, \"Ozone Season Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) Emission Limits for Simple Cycle and Regenerative Com bustion Turbines.\" The primary goal of this proposal is to lower allo wable NOx emissions from simple cycle and regenerative combustion turbines during the ozone season. The lower emissions from these sources will help to ad-NYS Register/August 21, 2019 Rule Making Activities 17dress Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements, ozone nonattainment and protect the health of New York State residents. This proposal is only applicable to simple cycle and regenerative combustion turbines. This is not a mandate on local governments. It applies to any entity that owns or op erates a subject source. STATUTORY AUTHORITY The statutory authority for the promulgation of Subpart 227-3 is found in the New York State Environmental Article 19 of the ECL was enacted to safeguard the air resourc es of New York from pollution and ensure the protection of the publ ic health and welfare, the natural resources of the State, physical pr operty, and integrating industrial development with sound environmental practices. NEEDS AND BENEFITS In March of 2008, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lowered the eight-hour ozone National Ambient Air Qua lity Stan- dard 0.075 ppm.1Subse- quently, on October 1, 2015, the EPA signed a rule that lowered this stan- dard to 0.070 ppm.2Ozone NAAQS attainment status is demonstrated by measurements recorded from a monitoring network set up acro ss the United States. EPA designated the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Islan d- Connecticut metropolitan area (New York metropolitan area , or NYMA) as a \"marginal\" nonattainment area for the 2008 ozone NAAQS effective July 20, 2012. On November 14, 2018 EPA proposed to reclassif y the NYMA to \"serious\" nonattainment.3The area was designated as \"moder- ate\" nonattainment for the 2015 ozone NAAQS.4NYMA monitors are currently reporting ozone concentrations of 0.082 ppm, wel l above the standard. Simple cycle and regenerative combustion turbines (SCCTs) sometimes referred to as peaking units, run to meet electric load durin g periods of peak electricity demand. They typically run on hot summer da ys when there is a strong likelihood of high ozone readings. Many peaking units in New York have high NOx emission rates, are inefcient and are approach- ing 50 years of age. It is difcult to install after-market controls on most of these units because of their age and site limitations. New York must fulll its CAA \"good neighbor\" obligations whi ch require states to include adequate measures in its state imp lementation plans (SIPs) prohibiting emissions of air pollutants \"in am ounts which will...contribute signicantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with main- tenance by, any other state with respect to\" a NAAQS. In addit ion, New York must meet the 2008 and 2015 ozone NAAQS, for which the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT area is in nonattainment. Because high ozone days signicantly impact human health in the NYMA and because older units signicantly contribute on the se days, DEC assessed the 99 high ozone days between 2011 and 2017. Ana lysis shown in Table 1. NOx (tons) sum of high ozone days 2011 - 2017 Table 1: NOx emissions from NY SCCTs.5 As demonstrated in Table 1, on high ozone days newer SCCTs produced 64 percent of the electricity generated from SCCTs while emitting only 4 percent of NOx emissions from these sources6. If the older sources were replaced with newer sources, the to tal NOx emissions from those older sources on the 99 high ozone days a ssessed would drop from the reported 1,849 tons to between 40 and 60 to ns depending on efciency. This would result in an approximate 1,800-ton reduction of NOx emissions over those high ozone days. A reduction of 18 tons of NOx emissions on an ozone season day would represent a reduc- tion of over 10 percent of NYMA NOx emissions from the electricity gen- eration sector and an overall reduction of 3.5 percent from all sources.7 Electric grid reliability: To adequately assess future reliability needs associated w ith this rule making the Department is proposing that affected facilities submit compli- ance plans by March 2, 2020 so that the New York Independent Sy stem Operator (NYISO) may include the compliance solutions sele cted by fa- cilities in its 2020 Reliability Needs Assessment (RNA). Proposal: To address NOx emissions on high ozone days from SCCTs, DEC is proposing to develop a new regulation, Subpart 227-3, that w ill apply toSCCTs with a nameplate capacity of 15 megawatts or greater th at inject power into the transmission or distribution systems. This r egulation will phase in lower emission limits for NOx and will limit the current averag- ing provision found in Subpart 227-2 during the ozone season. The sources subject to this proposal will continue to be subject to the requirements of Subpart 227-3 SCCTs during the ozone season while allowing more flexibility outside of the ozone season. Black start resources, dened i n paragraph 227-3.2(b)(1) of Subpart 227-3 as electric generating units used to bring a facility from shutdown to operational without reliance on e xternal sup- plies or the electrical system, will not be subject to Subpar t 227-2. The requirements of the proposed rule are presented in the follo wing paragraphs. Control Requirements: The NOx emission limits for SCCTs will be phased in as shown in Tables 2 and 3 below. These limits may be met by averaging SCCT s, electric storage resources and/or renewable generation re sources on a facility-wide basis. By May 1, 2023 NOx Emission Limit (ppmvd8) All SCCTs 100 Table 2: NOx emission limits for SCCTs beginning 5/1/2023 By May 1, 2025 Fuel Type NOx Emission Limit (ppmvd) Gaseous fuels 25 Distillate oil or other liquid fuel42 Table 3: NOx emission limits for SCCTs beginning 5/1/2025 Also beginning May 1, 2023, SCCTs will only be able to average emis- sions with other SCCTs at the facility or, if the facility opt s to utilize the electric storage and renewable energy resources complianc e option, then those SCCTs may average with approved electricity storage or renewable energy resources during the ozone season. Compliance Options: Owners and operators may elect to meet the limits as proposed. To offer flexibility, this rule is proposing two additional compliance options: 1) Owners and operators may elect an ozone season stop where it is re- corded in the operating permit that the source may not operate during the ozone season. 2) Owners and operators may elect to adhere to an output-base d NOx daily emission rate that includes electric storage and rene wable energy under common control with the SCCTs with which they are averaging. COSTS Older SCCTs are typically not conducive to the addition of re trot control technology. DEC expects that most impacted facilities will choose to replace or shutdown the non-compliant older SCCTs. To est imate replacement costs DEC looked to information provided by the NYISO and Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA). Table 4 presents costs developed by EIA and NYISO for full rep lace- ment of an SCCT. Source Overnight Cost ($/kW) Notes EIA $1,054 - $1,5589Range is specic for the Long Island and New York City area and includes conventional and advanced combustion turbines. NYISO $1,314 - $1,35710Range is specic for the Long Island and New York City area and represents replace- ment with a dual fuel peaking turbine. Table 4: Estimated range of overnight costs for full replace ment of an SCCT Most SCCTs have a capacity factor of less than 5 percent, meaning that they generate less than 5 percent of the electricity output that it is capable of generating. In addition, with the implementation of seve ral New York State initiatives,11demand for these units should continue to decline so the entire SCCT fleet would likely not need to be replaced. Owners and operators may opt to install after-market emissi on control devices such as water injection technology. While costs var y widelyNYS Register/August 21, 2019 Rule Making Activities 18depending on location, operation and siting, it has been reported to DEC, anecdotally, that the cost of adding after-market water inj ection to these older sources is approximately $2,000,000. Other sources r eport costs of $10,000 - $15,000 per megawatt,12however, this data does not include in- stallation and other associated costs. Cost of Nonattainment: This proposal is part of a suite of New York State efforts to br ing the NYMA into attainment of the ozone NAAQS, in order to protect h uman health. EPA projected a wide array of benets that would be realized on a national level, excluding California, if ozone attainment is achieved.13 The human cost of nonattainment to New York State residents is presented in Table 5. Attainment Provides Prevention of: Deaths from effects of ozone 13 - 22 Deaths from effects of PM2.5 31 - 70 Nonfatal heart attacks 4 - 36 Hospital admissions & emergency room visits 134 Acute bronchitis events 48 Upper & lower respiratory symptom events 1,540 Exacerbated asthma events 32,200 Missed work & school days 26,320 Restricted activity days 86,800 Table 5: Summary of Total Number of Annual Ozone and PM-Related Premature Mortalities and Premature Morbidity: 2025 Natio nal Benets (adapted from EPA, 2015 RIA, p. ES-16) LOCAL GOVERNMENT MANDATES The proposed regulation does not contain a mandate on local governments. PAPERWORK This proposal will require each affected facility to submit a compliance plan to DEC. The compliance plan will state how each facility plans to comply with the new requirements. Those facilities required to meet new emission limits will be required to submit permit applications to modify their Title V or State Facility permits to incorporate the newly applicable requirements by the May 1, 2023 compliance date. Subject facilities that do not use a continuous emissions mo nitoring system (CEMS) will be required to perform an emissions test t o assure compliance with the applicable NOx emission limits. Every subject facil- ity will be required to submit test protocols and test reports to the Depart- ment for approval. DUPLICATION The proposed Subpart 227-3 does not duplicate or conflict wit h any other state or federal requirements. ALTERNATIVES DEC considered two alternatives in assessing this proposal , leave the emission rates as they are and just lowering emission rate re quirements. The rst option would leave New York open to CAA Section 126 petitions and if acted upon by EPA could require controls within three y ears. The second option does not allow for the compliance flexibility and reliability considerations included in the proposal that were develope d during the stakeholder process. FEDERAL STANDARDS The proposed rule does not exceed any minimum federal standards. COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE March 2, 2020: All impacted sources must submit a compliance plan that must contain minimum data to demonstrate compliance wi ll be achieved.

Revised Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) is proposing new 6 NYCRR Subpart 227-3, \"Ozone Season Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) Emission Limits for Simple Cycle and Regener ative Combustion Turbines.\" The primary goal of this proposal is t o lower al- lowable NOx emission rates from simple cycle and regenerative combus- tion turbines (SCCTs) during the ozone season. EFFECT OF RULE DEC does not expect the requirements of this proposal to adve rsely impact employment opportunities with small businesses. Bu sinesses and local governments subject to this proposed rule generate electricity that is injected into the electrical grid and those facilities are required to maintain generation compliant with reliability rules at the federal and state level. The facilities subject to the proposed rule are mostly large businesses and corporations. The proposed regulation does not contain a mandate on local governments. Local governments have no additional complia nce obligations. There are two SCCTs that are owned by local gove rnments that are listed in the table below. While these sources will be subject to the requirements of this proposal, they already comply with the lower NOx rates and so no changes will be required of the facilities. Wh ile the two sources will be required to submit compliance plans, as outl ined below, their plan requirements are simplied because they already comply with the emissions limits. Facility Local Government Freeport Village of Freeport SA Carlson Town of Jamestown Table 1: Local Governments Subject to the Proposed Rule COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS On or before March 2, 2020: All impacted sources must submit a compliance plan that must, at minimum, contain: DNameplate capacity; DOwnership; DA list of each emission source that includes identifying numbers such as facility number, source number and name; DA schedule outlining how the owner or operator will comply with the requirements set forth in the rule; DWhich emission sources will install controls and what those controls will be; and DWhich emission sources will be replaced or repowered. Effective May 1, 2023: The rst phase of NOx emission limits will be implemented during the ozone season and SCCTs will be limited to aver- aging with other SCCTs, storage or renewable energy resources. The rst phase of emission limits will be: By May 1, 2023 NOx Emission Limit (ppmvd1) All simple cycle and regenerative combustion turbines100 Table 2: NOx emission limits for SCCTs beginning 5/1/2023 Effective May 1, 2025: The second and nal phase of NOx emissi on limits will be implemented during the ozone season as follows: Beginning May 1, 2025 Fuel Type NOx Emission Limit (ppmvd)NYS Register/August 21, 2019 Rule Making Activities 19Gaseous fuels 25 Distillate oil or other liq- uid fuel42 Table 3: NOx emission limits for SCCTs beginning 5/1/2025 PROFESSIONAL SERVICES It is not expected that small businesses or local governments are likely to need professional services to comply with this rule. If an affected source currently utilizes professional services, such as consult ing engineers, to comply with 6 NYCRR Subpart 227-2, they may continue to use th ose services to comply with the requirements of this proposal. COMPLIANCE COSTS Compliance costs discussed below are expected to impact larger power generation businesses, not small businesses or local governments. Discus- sion on the compliance costs to large generation businesses follows. DEC is proposing to require each source owner to develop a com pli- ance plan to demonstrate how they intend to comply with the pr oposed rule. The SCCTs installed prior to 1986 are typically not conducive to the addition of retrot control technology. As a result, DEC expects that most impacted SCCT owners will choose to replace or shutdown the n on- compliant SCCTs. To estimate replacement costs DEC looked to informa- tion provided by the NYISO and Department of Energy (DOE), En ergy Information Administration (EIA). The EIA describes overnight costs for electricity generating facilities as including2: DCivil and structural costs: allowance for site preparation, drainage, in- stallation of underground utilities, structural steel supply, and construction of buildings on the site; DMechanical equipment supply and installation: major equip ment, including but not limited to, boilers, flue gas desulfurizat ion scrubbers, cooling towers, steam turbine generators, condensers, pho tovoltaic modules, combustion turbines, and other auxiliary equipment; DElectrical and instrumentation and control: electrical tr ansformers, switchgear, motor control centers, switchyards, distribu ted control systems, and other electrical commodities; DProject indirect costs: engineering, distributable labor and materials, craft labor overtime and incentives, scaffolding costs, co nstruction management start up and commissioning, and contingency fees; and DOwners costs: development costs, preliminary feasibility and engineering studies, environmental studies and permittin g, legal fees, in- surance costs, property taxes during construction, and the electrical interconnection costs, including a tie-in to a nearby electrical transmission system.3 Table 4 presents the full overnight costs developed by EIA and NYISO for full replacement of an SCCT. Source Overnight Cost ($/kW) Notes EIA $1,054 - $1,5584Range is specic for the Long Island and New York City area and includes conventional and advanced combustion turbines. NYISO $1,314 - $1,3575Range is specic for the Long Island and New York City area and represents replace- ment with a dual fuel peaking turbine. Table 4: Estimated range of overnight costs for full replace ment of an SCCT DEC believes that the entire capacity of generation will likely not need to be replaced. Most SCCTs have a capacity factor of less than 5 percent, meaning that they generate less than 5 percent of the electricity output that they are capable of generating. In addition, with the implem entation of several New York State initiatives, including the State's r ecently an- nounced energy efciency and energy storage targets, Refor ming the Energy Vision and the Clean Energy Standard, demand for these u nits should continue to decline. There are over 3,400 MW of SCCT ca pacity listed in the NYISO Gold Book6that are older, pre-1986 SCCTs. Owners and operators may opt to install after-market emissi on control devices on sources that are unable to comply. Water injection technology is the after-market technology that a facility owner would likely consider for these older sources. The costs of adding after-market emission control devices varies widely depending on location, operation and land space availability. It has been reported to DEC, anecdotally, that the cost of add- ing after-market water injection to one of these older sourc es is ap- proximately two million dollars. Other sources discuss a cost of $10,000 -$15,000 per megawatt,7and many of the sources that would be impacted are 15 to 20 megawatts each. However, this data does not include installa- tion and other associated costs. ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY It is not expected that small businesses will need to comply w ith this proposed rule. As noted above, the two local governments sub ject to the emission limits already comply. This is not a mandate on small businesses or local government. MINIMIZING ADVERSE IMPACT To minimize any adverse impacts DEC is proposing a phase-in o f requirements as well as a reliability provision. The phase- in of require- ments allows for power companies, with affected sources, to plan over a longer term. In addition, DEC is proposing several compliance options to offer compliance flexibility: 1) Owners and operators may elect an ozone season stop where it is re- corded in their operating permit that the source may not operate during the ozone season. 2) Owners and operators may elect to adhere to an output-base d NOx daily emission rate that includes electric storage and rene wable energy under common control with the SCCTs with which they are averaging. SMALL BUSINESS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTICIPA- TION DEC participated in several stakeholder meetings includin g those for impacted facilities and local environmental justice groups over a period of eighteen months. In addition, DEC posted a stakeholder outl ine on the DEC website to encourage stakeholder participation and com ment.8 SCCTs, as applicable in this regulation, are electric generating sources and not considered small businesses. Sources identied to be go vernment owned already comply with the proposed standard and had the opportunity to participate in the stakeholder process. CURE PERIOD OR AMELIORATIVE ACTION No additional cure period or other opportunity for ameliorative action is included in Subpart 227-3. This proposal will not result in i mmediate violations or impositions of penalties for existing facilities. To help reduce immediate impacts on affected sources, Subpart 227-3 requires a compli- ance plan due on March 2, 2020 followed by reduced NOx emission limits phased-in rst on May 1, 2023 and later on May 1, 2025. This will allow owners and operators of affected sources time to comply with the proposed Subpart 227-3.

Revised Rural Area Flexibility Analysis The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) is proposing new 6 NYCRR Subpart 227-3, \"Ozone Season Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) Emission Limits for Simple Cycle and Regener ative Combustion Turbines.\" The primary goal of this proposal is t o lower al- lowable NOx emission rates from simple cycle and regenerative combus- tion turbines (SCCTs) during the ozone season. TYPES AND ESTIMATED NUMBERS OF RURAL AREAS Only one facility located in a rural area is affected by this regulation - the Samuel A. Carlson Generating Station located in Jamestown, Chautau- qua County. REPORTING, RECORDKEEPING AND OTHER COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS; AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES Reporting & Recordkeeping: This proposal will require each affected facility to submit a compliance plan to DEC. The compliance plan will state how each facility plans to comply with the new requirements. Those facilities required to meet new emission limits will be required to submit permit applications to modify their permits to incor porate the newly applicable requirements by the May 1, 2023 compliance date. If theNYS Register/August 21, 2019 Rule Making Activities 20facility operates under a Title V permit, these changes can be incorporated into the renewal application (Title V permits must be renewed at ve-year intervals). If there are no changes caused by the proposed Su bpart 227-3 no permit action is required. Subject facilities that do not use a continuous emissions mo nitoring system (CEMS) will be required to perform an emissions test t o assure compliance with the applicable NOx emission limits. Every subject facil- ity will be required to submit test protocols and test report s to DEC for approval. An owner or operator that elects to use the Electric Storage and Renew- able Energy Resources compliance option must submit annual electricity generation and NOx emissions data to DEC. Compliance Requirements: On or before March 2, 2020: All impacted sources must submit a compliance plan that must, at minimum, contain: DNameplate capacity; DOwnership; DA list of each emission source that includes identifying numbers such as facility number, source number and name; DA schedule outlining how the owner or operator will comply with the requirements set forth in the rule; DWhich emission sources will install controls and what those controls will be; and DWhich emission sources will be replaced or repowered. Effective May 1, 2023: The rst phase of NOx emission limits will be implemented during the ozone season and SCCTs will be limited to aver- aging with other SCCTs, storage or renewable energy resources.

COSTS The Samuel A. Carlson Generating Station already complies w ith the NOx rates in the proposed rule. Therefore, no changes will be required of the facility. A compliance plan is still required by March 2, 2020. The costs of preparing the compliance plan should be minimal. MINIMIZING ADVERSE IMPACT Since the Samuel A. Carlson Generating Station already complies with the NOx rates in the proposed rule, there are no adverse impac ts to that facility.

Revised Job Impact Statement The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) is proposing new 6 NYCRR Subpart 227-3, \"Ozone Season Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) Emission Limits for Simple Cycle and Regener ative Combustion Turbines.\" The primary goal of this proposal is t o lower al-lowable NOx emission rates from simple cycle and regenerative combus- tion turbines during the ozone season. NATURE OF IMPACT DEC does not expect the requirements of this proposal to adve rsely impact employment opportunities at the affected sources. T he affected sources generate electricity that is injected into the elec trical grid and those facilities are required to maintain generation compl iant with reli- ability rules at the federal and state level. CATEGORIES AND NUMBERS AFFECTED This proposal will affect facilities that use older simple c ycle and regenerative combustion turbines (SCCTs) to generate elec tricity for the electrical grid. Newer SCCTs are expected to already meet th e require- ments set forth in this proposal. At least 18 facilities utilizing older SCCTs will be affected by this proposal. REGIONS OF ADVERSE IMPACT This is a statewide proposal, so all SCCTs will be subject to the require- ments of a nal rule. However, most SCCTs are located in New York City and on Long Island. MINIMIZING ADVERSE IMPACT The proposed rule contains several compliance options that owners and operators may utilize in order to comply with the proposed requirements. The rst is to meet the limits as proposed. Owners and operators may also opt to shut down or not run non-compliant SCCTs during the ozone season. If an owner or operator elects to not run an SCCT during the ozone season, it must be recorded in the operating permit. Another compliance option of- fered in this proposal allows an owner or operator of an existing source to comply with applicable limits by meeting an average output- based emis- sion limit (that includes renewables and storage) as a daily average emis- sion rate. Under this option, the storage or renewable energ y resource must be under common control with the SCCTs to be included in the aver- aging calculation. These compliance options will allow existing SCCTs that can not meet the proposed emission limits to operate for a few additional years while new SCCTs or other electricity generating resources are constructed. As a result, the Department does not anticipate adverse impacts to employment opportunities at a company subject to the rule. SELF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES It is not expected that the proposed Subpart 227-3 will have a measur- able impact on opportunities for self-employment. INITIAL REVIEW The initial review of this rule shall occur no later than in th e third calendar year after the year in which the rule is adopted. Assessment of Public Comment A total of 143 distinct comments were submitted by the public in re- sponse to the Department's proposed rule for regulating simple cycle and regenerative combustion turbines, often referred to as \"peakers\" (Subpart 227-3). The purpose of this summary is to highlight the key issues raised by the public and the Department's response to those issues. This sum- mary is divided into eight sections, each summarizing a different high- lighted topic from comments received. 1. General Comments The Department received general comments in support of the r egula- tion and clean air in New York State and responded by thanking those commenters for their support of lowering nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission rates from simple cycle and regenerative combustion turbin es (SCCTs). One commenter also noted that even if the Environmental Prot ection Agency (EPA) does not ultimately reclassify the New York City metropol- itan area as a \"serious\" nonattainment area, the DEC should still enact the regulation. The Department agrees. 2. Applicability The Department received several comments seeking an applic ability exemption for \"black start\" SCCTs. Black start sources help re-start a fa- cility after an outage. Commenters also suggested that SCCT s be exempt from this regulation if they provide second-order continge ncy support. The Department agrees that black start sources should remai n exempt as their use is infrequent when they are used to re-start a facil ity after an outage. However, the Department does not agree that contingency or other ancillary services where black start units inject electricity to the electricity grid should be exempt from these requirements. To address the black start source exemption, the Department has revised the applicabi lity section and added a denition of black start source to the denitions section of the revised proposed rule. The applicability section of the initial proposal required that sources must bid into the New York Independent System Operator (NYIS O) Wholesale Market to be applicable to the regulation. The Dep artment received comments suggesting that this language created a potential loop- hole allowing sources to pull out of the NYISO Wholesale Market and sell power separately. To address this potential loophole, the D epartment's revised proposed rule states that the requirements apply to those sources which inject power to the grid instead of bid into the NYISO Wh olesale Market.NYS Register/August 21, 2019 Rule Making Activities 213. Denitions In the proposal, the Department dened the ozone season as Ma y 1 - October 31 which corresponds to the monitoring requirement s for the ozone season. Commenters suggest that this was confusing as the existing emissions reporting ozone season is May 1 - September 30. The Depart- ment agrees and has changed this denition. The Department received comment asking for clarication wh ether sources covered under the denition of common control inclu de renew- able or electric storage resources. The Department's original intent was to include renewable and electric storage resources under tha t denition of common control and revised the denition in the revised proposed regula- tion to ensure that this was clear. 4. Control Requirements There was some question about how Subpart 227-2 and Subpart 227-3 interact as both The proposed Subpart 227-3 r equire- ments are applicable only during the ozone season while the requirements of Subpart 227-2 apply year-round. There was also a question about whether averaging is on a weighted basis. The Department int ended for the control requirements to be on a weighted average basis and the revised proposed rule claries this intention. 5. Compliance Options The Department received numerous comments regarding the co mpli- ance options which allow averaging with renewable and storage resources. Many commenters were in favor of this compliance option. Two com- menters suggested averaging times shorter than 24 hours. The Department considered this option, reviewed available data and consul ted with the New York State Department of Public Service (DPS) and the New York Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) with r espect to the operation of the SCCTs and what is expected with the ave raging option. Based on the information gathered and the newly rele ased Peak Study Analysis1developed by NYSERDA and led by DPS, the Depart- ment believes that a 24-hour time frame is reasonable. Howev er, the regulation requires the submission of data on the operation of renewable energy and energy storage resources be submitted to the Depa rtment annually. The Department will monitor how the averaging option is being utilized to ensure that emission reductions are being realized. If the Depart- ment nds that this option allows for circumvention of the rule, the Depart- ment may propose future changes following the requirements of the State Administrative Procedures Act. 6. Reliability & Compliance Plans The regulation allows for the NYISO and transmission/distr ibution owners to assess whether a source may be needed for the reliability of the electricity grid. If a reliability need is determined by the NYISO or transmission/distribution owner, then an extension to com ply may be granted to the source. This provision was developed as a resu lt of the stakeholder process. There was general support for this pro vision with some exceptions. For the NYISO or transmission/distributi on owners to determine if a source is needed for reliability, they must r st be notied that the source is planning to shut down. This will be realize d, in part, through a required compliance plan which must be submitted t o the Department by March 2, 2020. Some commenters suggested that the rule should allow for compliance plans to be modied or changed. The Depart- ment disagrees as the basis for determining whether a source is needed for reliability is determined by the degree of condence in the c ompliance plan. The Department expects the NYISO or transmission/dis tribution owners to use the compliance plans in their 2020 Reliability Needs As- sessment to determine if and where reliability needs exist. 7. Permitting The Department received comments regarding timing with res pect to permitting as well as reliability assessments and intercon nection to the grid. The compliance schedules in the regulation were devel oped in consultation with multiple stakeholders, including DPS, a nd offers implementation flexibility. The Department believes that there is sufcient time to comply with the regulatory requirements even when co nsidering the current Article 10 process. The Department believes tha t the provi- sions set forth in paragraph 227-3.5(b) reflect the outcome of the stake- holder process and allows multiple options for compliance w ithout the need for additional extensions and delayed compliance. Sub part 227-3 requires the submittal of compliance plans in 2020 and NOx em ission limit requirements beginning in 2023 and 2025. With an up to f our-year reliability extension, this would result in compliance in 2 027 and 2029 and the Department believes that this gives affected sources enough time to comply. 8. Environmental Justice Some comments were received stating that environmental jus tice organizations should be allowed to participate in the siting decisions with respect to new electricity generation. The Department intends to continue to collect stakeholder input, including from environmental justice groups. In addition, the NYISO's Comprehensive Reliability Plan (C RP) is developed through an open stakeholder process where enviro nmentaljustice groups may participate. During the CRP process, the issues which the commenters raised are typically addressed. \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1NYSDPS website: http://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/Co mmon/ ViewDoc.aspx?DocRefId=%7BFDE2C318-277F-4701-B7D6- C70FCE0C6266%7D Department of Financial Services NOTICE OF ADOPTION Security at Automated Teller Facilities I.D.

Assessment of Public Comment The New York State Department of Health (Department) receiv ed one set of comments from an advocacy organization in response to the proposed amendments to Parts 415 of Title 10 of the Ofcial Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York. Thos e com- ments are summarized below along with the Department's responses. Comment: The commenter asked for clarication of the \"Legis lative Objectives\" of Article 28 of the Public Health Law (PHL), outlined in the Proposed Rulemaking, including what is meant by an \"appropriate action\" in response to a natural disaster or signicant change to nur sing home occupancy. The commenter also questioned where \"such action\" is autho- rized in law or the regulations of the Department. Response: PHL \u00a7 2800 confers upon the Department \"the centra l, comprehensive responsibility for the development and admi nistration of the state's policy with respect to hospital and related serv ices,\" with the goal of protecting and promoting the health of the residents of New York State. Given the scope of this responsibility, what constitutes \"appropriate action\" will depend on specic circumstances of the emergen cy, whether that be a natural disaster, an emergency at a particular faci lity, or viola- tions of PHL or regulations occurring at a particular facili ty. No changes were made to the regulation as a result of this comment. Comment: The commenter suggested that facility compliance could be improved if the Department would send the weekly reminder em ail to nursing homes on Wednesday of each week rather than on Tuesda y. The commenter believes these reminders could be more effective if they are sent at a point in time when the facilities can immediately ac t on the re- minder and enter the data into the Health Commerce System (HCS). The commenter further suggested that the Department ensure tha t reporting requirements are explicit with regard to specialty bed cate gories and whether they are properly included in a facility's reported total capacity and census data. Response: The Department agrees with the comments and will send the weekly reminder email to nursing homes on Wednesday of each w eek. The Department intends to clarify reporting of current occu pancy data including specialty bed categories and total capacity, in a Dear Administra- tor Letter. Further clarication will be available on the HC S Health Electronic Response Data System (HERDS). No changes were ma de to the regulation as a result of this comment. Comment: The commenter asked whether non-compliance with t his proposed regulation could result in a nancial penalty to a nursing home. The commenter suggested that possible nancial penalties s hould be clearly disclosed in the Costs to Private Regulated Parties and Costs to Lo- cal Government section. Response: The \"Cost to Private Regulated Parties\" and \"Costs to Local Government\" sections of the Regulatory Impact Statement fo r the proposed regulation are intended to detail the monetary cost of compliance. Financial penalties associated with non-compliance with r egulations are established in PHL \u00a7 \u00a7 12 and 12-b. No changes were made to the regula- tion as a result of this comment.

Statutory authority: Public Service Law, sections 5(1)(b), (2), 65(1), (2), (3), 66(2) and (5) Subject: Compensation of distributed energy resources. Purpose: To ensure just and reasonable rates, including compensation for distributed energy resources. Substance of proposed rule: The Public Service Commission (Commis- sion) is considering the Petition for Compensation Accordi ng to the Alternative 2 Capacity Value Calculation Set Forth in the VD ER Transi- tion Order (Petition), led on July 19, 2019 by Borrego Solar Inc. (Bor- rego) on behalf of its afliate 1115 Solar Development, LLC. The petition explains that Borrego is developing a community distrib- uted generation (CDG) project at 225 Finchville Turnpike, Mt. Hope, New York, 10963 (the Finchville Project). The petition states that, based on the timing of the Finchville Project's development, Borrego ex pected and performed analysis and made nancial commitments relying o n the rules for CDG compensation for projects qualifying in June 2018. B orrego explains that the Finchville Project did qualify in June 2018. However, the petition explains, because the Finchville Project qualied in the Orange & Rockland service territory after the initial capacity allocations in that terri- tory were exhausted, it will instead receive CDG compensati on based on the rules for projects qualifying after July 2018, pursuant to the Commis- sion's April 18, 2019 Order Regarding Value Stack Compensat ion. Bor- rego explains that this change, and specically the resulting change to the element of compensation based on installed capacity value provided by a project, will have a negative impact on the Finchville Proje ct's nancial viability. Borrego states that it reasonably relied on the information avail- able at the time in making nancial commitments regarding the Finchville Project. Borrego therefore requests that the Finchville Pr oject receive compensation for the installed capacity value element base d on the rules in place for projects qualifying in June 2018. Borrego notes that this is consistent with relief granted in other situations where a distributed gener- ation project had made nancial commitments in reasonable reliance on a rule that was later modied.

Substance of emergency rule (Full text is posted at the follo wing State website: https://www.tax.ny.gov/rulemaker/ default.ht m): Tax Law Article 29-C mandates the payment of a surcharge, effective January 1, 2019, on the provision of certain intrastate for-hire trans portation that begins in, ends in, or passes through the geographic area of t he city of New York, in the borough of Manhattan, south of and excluding 96th Street (the \"congestion zone\"). The provisions of Article 29-C req uire, among other things, that persons liable for the congestion surcharge register with the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance and keep records of the transportation they are responsible for. This rule adds a new Subchapter E (section 700.1 through section 700.4) to Chapter IV of Title 20 NYCRR. Section 700.1 contains denitions that are applicable throughout Subchapter E, while section 700. 2 reflects the imposition of the congestion surcharge. Section 700.3 sets forth registra- tion and renewal requirements (including the payment of fees) for persons liable for the surcharge. Finally, section 700.4 identies the types of re- cords and information that must be kept, how they must be kept and transmitted, and who is responsible for keeping them (i.e., persons liable for the congestion surcharge). The rule is being readopted as an emergency measure to avoid a gap in effectiveness between the date on which the previously adop ted emer- gency rule expires and the date on which the rule becomes effe ctive as a permanent measure, when published in the State Register. The text of the permanent rule is identical to that of the previously adopte d emergency rules. This notice is intended to serve only as a notice of emergency adoption. This agency intends to adopt the provisions of this emergenc y rule as a permanent rule, having previously submitted to the Department of State a notice of proposed rule making, I.D. No. TAF-09-19-00005-E P, Issue of June 26, 2019. The emergency rule will expire August 21, 2019. Text of rule and any required statements and analyses may be obtained from: Kathleen D.

Statutory authority: Tax Law, section 171, subdivision F irst, gener- ally authorizes the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance to promulgateregulations; section 1096(a) of the Tax Law generally authorizes the Com- missioner to make such rules and regulations, and to require such facts and information to be reported, as it may deem necessary to en force the provisions of Article 27 of the Tax Law; section 1299-G of Article 29-C of the Tax Law states that the provisions of Article 27 of the Tax Law apply with respect to the administration of and procedure with res pect to the congestion surcharge; section 1299-A of Article 29-C of the Tax Law imposes a surcharge on for-hire transportation trips that b egin in, end in, or pass through the geographic area of the city of New York, in the borough of Manhattan, south of and excluding 96th Street (the \"congestion zone\"); Article 29-C of the Tax Law requires the Commissioner to administer the congestion surcharge, and to accept the registration of per sons liable for the surcharge. Section 1299-C of Article 29-C requires that persons liable for the congestion surcharge le with the Commissioner a com pleted ap- plication for a certicate of registration, in a form prescribed by the Com- missioner, subject to renewal in accordance with rules promulgated by the Commissioner. Section 1299-E of Article 29-C requires records to be kept by persons liable for the surcharge. 2. Legislative objectives: New Subchapter E (section 700.1 through section 700.4) of Chapter IV of Title 20 NYCRR reflects the imposition of the congestion surcharge. Subchapter E implements the regi stration and administration requirements of Article 29-C of the Tax Law. Section 700.1 of Subchapter E contains denitions that are applicable thr oughout Subchapter E, while section 700.2 reflects the imposition of the conges- tion surcharge. Section 700.3 sets forth registration and r enewal require- ments (including the payment of fees) for persons liable for the surcharge. Finally, section 700.4 identies the types of records and in formation that must be kept, how they must be kept and transmitted, and who is responsible for keeping them (i.e., persons liable for the c ongestion surcharge). 3. Needs and benets: This rule sets forth the renewal and reg istration requirements necessary to comply with Article 29-C, as well as the re- cords that must be kept to accomplish compliance with Article 29-C. This rule benets taxpayers by putting in place the means for comp lying with the congestion surcharge effective January 1, 2019. 4. Costs: (a) Costs to regulated parties for the implementation and co ntinuing compliance with this rule: There is no additional cost or burden to comply with these amendments. There is no additional time period ne eded for compliance. (b) Costs to this agency, the State and local governments for the implementation and continuation of this rule: Since the nee d to make amendments to the New York State Sales and Use and Other Misce l- laneous Tax regulations under Article 29-C of the Tax Law ari ses due to the statutory changes requiring that the Commissioner admi nister the congestion surcharge, and accept the registration of those who will be li- able for the surcharge, there are no costs to this agency or the State and lo- cal governments that are due to the promulgation of this rule. (c) Information and methodology: This analysis is based on a review of the statutory requirements and on discussions among person nel from the Department's Taxpayer Guidance Division, Ofce of Counsel , Ofce of Tax Policy Analysis Bureau of Tax and Fiscal Studies, Ofce o f Budget and Management Analysis, and Management Analysis and Proje ct Ser- vices Bureau. 5. Local government mandates: There are no costs or burdens imposed on local governments to comply with this amendment. 6. Paperwork: This rule will not require any new forms or information. The rule merely implements the registration, renewal and re cordkeeping requirements of Article 29-C of the Tax Law. 7. Duplication: This rule does not duplicate any other requirements. 8. Alternatives: Since Article 29-C, as added by Part NNN of C hapter 59 of the Laws of 2018, requires that the Commissioner admini ster the congestion surcharge, and prescribes renewal, registration and recordkeep- ing requirements, there are no viable alternatives to providing for registra- tion, renewal and recordkeeping procedures and methods. 9. Federal standards: This rule does not exceed any minimum standards of the federal government for the same or similar subject area. 10. Compliance schedule: The required registration, renew al and recordkeeping information has been made available to regul ated parties, by means of the emergency adoption of New Subchapter E of the S ales and Use and Other Miscellaneous Tax Regulations on November 19, 2018, the readoption as an emergency measure and proposal as a permanent rule on February 12, 2019 and the subsequent readoption as an emergency rule on April 10, 2019 and June 6, 2019, in sufcient time for affected parties to comply with the congestion surcharge effective January 1 , 2019. This rule readopts the amendments relating to the congestion sur charge as an emergency measure in order to maintain the effectiveness of the amend- ments until the adoption of the rule as a permanent measure be comes ef- fective, when published in the State Register.

PUBLIC NOTICE Department of State F-2019-0709-DA Date of Issuance - August 21, 2019 The New York State Department of State (DOS) is required by Federal regulations to provide timely public notice for the activities described below, which are subject to the consistency provi sions of the Federal Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended. The applicant has certied that the proposed activities comply with and will be conducted in a manner consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the federally approved New York State Coas tal Management Program (NYSCMP). The applicant's consistency certi- cation and accompanying public information and data are av ailable for inspection at the New York State Department of State ofc es lo- cated at One Commerce Plaza, 99 Washington Avenue, in Albany , New York. In F-2019-0709-DA, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Nation al Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National M arine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is proposing to adjust regulatory measures put in place to manage bluen tuna bycatch in the pelagic long line shery for Atlantic highly migratory species (HMS), speci cally ad- dressing the Northeastern United States Closed Area, the Ca pe Hat- teras Gear Restricted Area, and the Spring Gulf of Mexico Gea r Restricted Area, as well as the weak hook requirement in the Gulf of Mexico. Several of the proposed measures would have an evaluation period component to determine whether the current area-based mana gement measures remain necessary to reduce and/ or maintain low numbers of bluen tuna discards and interactions in the pelagic longli ne shery. Other proposed measures would eliminate the Cape Hatteras G ear Restricted Area and would adjust the requirement to use weak hooks from a year-round requirement to a seasonal (January-June) requirement. The proposed measures would affect the HMS pel agic longline shery in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico.A set of four (4) preferred management alternatives advance d by NMFS (in the context of the existing 2006 HMS Fishery Management Plan and its amendments and employing signicant scientic and sheries data and geographic information) encompass propo sed regulatory changes affecting the Atlantic pelagic longlin e (PLL) shery and may potentially impact or have implications affe cting important coastal and ocean resources of New York State. In particu- lar, the Northeastern United States Closed Area employs a se asonal closure to shing efforts using longline gear within a desig nated offshore spatial boundary. This shery management area ove rlaps in part with offshore management areas of interest to New York S tate - New York State's Ocean Planning Area (OPA) and the New York Coastal Management Program's Renewable Energy Geographic Loca- tion Description (GLD). Additionally, proposed changes affecting a large gear restricted area offshore of North Carolina and two spatially managed areas within the Gulf of Mexico, as well as a proposed rule change effectively limiting implementation of weak hook requirements for pelagic longl ine sh- ers throughout the Gulf of Mexico to a six-month season, may impact the highly migratory stock of bluen tuna over the near and long-term. Western Atlantic Bluen Tuna (BFT) - (Thunnus thynnus) - are targeted by both commercial and recreational shers of New Y ork State. Maintaining healthy stocks, viable sheries, and reducing BFT bycatch and mortality are in the interests of protecting New York State's coastal and offshore resources. The NMFS draft regulatory amendment - RIN-0648-BI51 (May 2019), Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA), and the 2006 Consoli- dated Atlantic HMS Fishery Management Plan (FMP) and its subse- quent amendments are available from the HMS Division of NMFS at https://www.sheries.noaa.gov/topic/atlantic-highly -migratory- species. The federal agency's consistency determination and accompanying public information and data are available for inspection at the New York State Department of State ofces located at One Commerc e Plaza, 99 Washington Avenue, in Albany, New York.
