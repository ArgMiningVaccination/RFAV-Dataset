Martin Niemoller, Lu[heran INTRODUCTION Itismy intention inthis dissertation toillustrate that inorder toachieve what therapists call transparent relationships with clients, itisnecessary tobegin the process with in-depth self-examination: tofully understand one's own preconceived notions that govern one's practice. This examination may require theprocess of deconstructing one's professional and personal histories, followed by an understanding which sets thestage forreconstruction. The analysis oftheprocess, in thisdissertation, will befrom arelational perspective. What ismeant bytransparency, and why has this concept become increasingly interesting topsychotherapists? When we speak oftransparency intherapeutic relationships, werefer toarelationship that isauthentic, open and contained by boundaries that areflexible, and regulated bytheunique needs ofeach situation. It also speaks totheneed toshare information and, tosome degree, torelinquish the expert role. making process. Transparency requires that therapists beboth connected to,and concerned with, theclient's story. Itdces notsuggest that toroutinely one's 1978, 1981), may well create aprohibitive boundary between therapists andclients. There isnointended proposal here that therapists need toshare their own stories with their clients. Self disclosure and transparency, aswill be discussed inChapter 4areseparate issues. Itdces seem relevant, even necessary, for therapists tobefully aware oftheir own stories and the impact that the stories inevitably have onhow they think and relate -what isshared and what ishidden. It dces notnecessitate sharing allofthese details with clients -onthecontrary, itis important toleave time and space fortheir stories. Atherapist's being fully aware of herown experience isnecessary only tothedegree that itdces make itpossible what isrelevant forsharing and which issues aredifficult forthetherapist to entertain with anopen mind. Itisclear that changes are overdue inwhat has been called `apaid intimate relationship that thrusts clients and therapists into navigating personal and professional boundaries' (Imber-Black, 2005). We've come toatime inthis sociopolitical period ofourlives people, with agrowing sense ofisolation despite easy access tovarious kinds ofinformation, want something more from thetalking therapies. Families ofchronic psychiatric patients have formed their own associations tonegotiate with government and the mental health system onbehalf oftheir relatives. Indications thatpeople feel alone pain enterprise ofself-help literature and theconfessional talk shows inAmerica (Oprah and Dr. Phil). Itseems clear that thetherapeutic relationships onwhich most ofushave based our practice may nolonger be appropriate inthis world ofinformational saturation (Gergen, 1991). Isdisclosure information appropriate helpful toeveryone that weconsult? Even themost open among usbehave differently with different clients. That difference may well have more todowith usthan with our clients' needs. We each, inour personal histories, make discreet judgments about people. And many ofthese judgments or observations may bebased oninfluences gleaned from anerathat isnolonger an appropriate context for today's world. Whatever meaning we give tothese differences, they construct theresulting relationship. Princeton Professor Karen Armstrong, inThe Spiral Staircase (1994), suggests the necessity `tomake room inourheads' forothers. This and wedonotachieve this selection inisolation from other collaborators ideas. which opens tothe even self-evaluation isanactivity undertaken with the participation ofothers. Without viewing our histories inrelation toothers, wemay find ourselves caught upinarepetitive cycle that offers understanding. This collaboration may beachieved through aform ofre-storying, aprocess that includes others. The past did nothappen Allofour activities areconducted in relationships, including psychotherapy. OnBecoming aTransparent Therapist The concern ofthis dissertation ismore with practicing clinicians than with the training offuture onesl. The belief isthat the newer therapists arealready being influenced byaninformational world that was notavailable tothose ofuswho have been inpractice foralong time. They have also been trained inacontext inwhich Health Management Organizations (HMO's) already had avoice indecision making about treatment. Areview ofresearch onthesubject oftranspazency inpsychotherapy is only now unfolding within the various therapeutic models: systems theory, psychodynamic theory and narrative therapy. Perhaps we,astherapists, have notbeen attentive toour own history, personal and professionaL This dissertation will show what such aself-examination can reveal, inthis case with atherapist, myself, who was both analyzed and benefited from therapy, also aspart ofhertraining. The self-examination referred tointhis dissertation istheadult commentary onthe life and memories ofachild who lived through World War IIand constructed and reconstructed aself inachanging cast of\"Others\", who gave direction toaspecific profession, and who changed even astheprofession itself redirected itself over time. Inthis study, Iwill examine anumber ofmajor narratives that inform an understanding ofidentity and transparency intherapeutic practice. The first story is 5about me,thechild who lived through and survived awar, andbegins when Iwas two years ofage and ends when Iwas seven. The second story addresses itself tothe aftermath: how that child, whose early lifeisinformed byacombination oflosses, terror, upheaval, love, culture and fanuly values, develops a`self ~d becomes a teacher and practitioner offamily therapy while remaining indoctrinated inthesilent decree which sheunderstands istokeep secrets. How dces who weareintheyears ofdevelopment influence who webecome as professionals? Our stories endure and change over time inthemultiple relationships and conversations that wehave, particularly inthesystem that influences and directs ouractions. My onprofessional -apractice that changes inthe field ofpractice, made choices, and influenced theprofession while attempting to remain loyal tothevalues oftheself. Those values ofselfazerecognized asemerging from all[hose who inchildhood, inthe most devastating waz ofour time. This isalso astory that provides anindividual with meaning, unity and purpose -inother words, anidentity. Attention will begiven tothestory about this story, and, asthetale progresses, the story inside thestory, which isalso about how lives arelived. How wemanage who webecome cannot beseparated from therelationships that weencounter. These relationships and conversations, conducted and overheazd, azewhat open thedoor to altemative understanding. The choice towrite this intheformat ofanautobiographical takes this dissertation out ofthe oftradition dissertations. Inthe methodology chapter Iwill cite writers, particulazly John Paul EakinZ(1999), who have put the reliability ofautobiographical history into question.2 However, memories have an abiding influence onour actions and therapy, finally, islargely about thepersonal recounting ofstories azeinlarge undertaken toforge like process. What transparency tell us,astherapists, about what wecanand cannot doinvarious weazeaspeople and This dissertation dces notpresume topresent final answers. Itwill explore how to begin and atherapist who isopen torelationships, making disclosures when they are pertinent and appropriate, and understanding the therapeutic relationship asoneofcollaboration rather than domination, ofinformation sharing andtheinclusion oftheclient, tothegreatest degree possible, inthedecision making process. This isanarrative dissertation that examines how lifestories inform theprofessional and how even themost unwelcome events The entry into anydiscussion fortherapists who view change asacollaborative activity between self and client. Itisone task ofthis andpresent theories that are part ofthevoyage. The dissertation will also focus ontherelationships experienced over time, and how lifestories change and adjust innewly recreated realities. Iaminterested intheimpact isthat this dissertation isbeing written atthe convergence ofthree important events that are pertinent tothis story. One isan increase inqualitative reseazch studies, particularly those that not only describe a subjective work without qualifying statistics, butincludes narratives ofabiographical nature that give voice toreflections that integrate personal experiences with scholarly observations. This development has made itprogressively more acceptable for professionals, including psychologists them theyoungest tohave lived through thewar) and thebetter- known works ofprofessional writers such Victor Frankel and Primo Levi, that has released thelong-suppressed memories that were considered tooprivate and shameful toshare. These adult commentaries onchildhood experiences may serve asan invitation forthe reader toenter into adialogue ofpersonal stories about wars, including themost recent ones. The emerging interest inHolocaust stories permits amore scholarly approach tothe subject. Rather than examining theexperience itself foranswers toclearly articulated experience andafter thewar, hasinfluenced professional practice. The third event isanincreased awareness fortheneed ofachanged relationship between therapists and clients that isless shrouded inmystery and more transparent. This lasthasresulted inagrowing interest as their story. Narrative theemergence ofthese three events came the decision towrite anarrative dissertation, particularly one that involved interviews, alogical choice foranadmirer ofJerome Bruner (1986) andElliot Mishler (1991). The option ofautobiography and social construction was asecond choice and adifficult decision foraclinician whose professional career was embedded insystems theory and whose personal bias was to reveal only what was deemed essential tothebetter understanding ofarelationship. In retrospect, being theall-knowing expert was never acomfortable role forme. Itisno longer clear whether thedecision toseek out more openness was due tochanged views about therapy orwhether working with partners, who advised from behind the 8one-way mirror, eventually became adiscomfort and aliability, personal or professional. The eventual result was the involvement ofcolleagues who were prepared toshaze their views openly with thefamilies who consulted us.(Andersen, 1987) Ihad been both intrigued and concerned foranumber ofyears about theexploration oftherapists' lives and identity formation asapossible book ordissertation topic. I was curious how one's lifestories might offer more complex understandings about the choices clinicians make and how weinfluence atherapeutic relationship. Inorder to carry outthis form ofinquiry, itwas necessary tointerview experienced therapists who were known fortheir work with couples. However, after aseries ofinterviews with highly respected colleagues whose work has gained worldwide recognition (Cecchin, Elkaim, participants intheir thinking rather than topose procedural Ineeded a better understanding -orperhaps arenewed understanding ofmy own experience and how me.And sothedissertation changed from looking outtolooking in.

Atthesame time itisanarrative oftheself, anarrative various parts oftheselfinto acoherent whole through therelationships thathave been constructed. Having decision tousemyown experience aspart ofthematerial formy thesis, thenext step, finding atheoretical approach, was alogical one. What was 9needed was anew dialogue and way ofviewing thecreation ofineaning through collaborative activities asrequired, rather than the individual responses toapre- detennined quest. Social construction offered analtemative way ofviewing theworld -not through absolutes but through beunderstood notasisolated acts butaspart ofatapestry that iswoven from theculture, traditions and history ofthose involved and simultaneously holds meaning forthefuture. This tapestry traces theinternal story asitbegins tobring together many threads: thestories ofhow people, even young children, hold onto who they are, and how many aspects ofour daily lives, such as`aloneness', are accomplished inrelationship with others. This dissertation therefore isalso aninquiry into aprofessional practice -one that began more than thirty years ago and hasalso included teaching and supervision of psychotherapy. Iwill explore the ways inwhich my beliefs and experience have influenced theprocess oftherapy. Iwill attempt tomaintain anawareness that this analysis may also serve asaform ofintervention. One might ask, `Why not accomplish this research through ananalysis ofa patiendclient relationship'? This, after all,iswhat wetherapists and teachers have done best. The reasoning here isthat therapists have tended tolead lives inthe shadows -inspite ofthecurrent intheperson ofthetherapist written `subjects' aslong inthe narrative byremaining embedded intheeloquence ofour theory. And our elegant theories have not always served uswell when they encouraged the creation of dichotomies ofexpert andlearner, teacher andstudent, doctor and patient. My chosen -narrative haschanged thirty years that Ihave had the opportunity tomake relationships with a remarkable group ofpeople who allowed meinto their lives. The dissertation will bedivided into five chapters: 10Chapter One: Methodology will discuss and contrast themethodological issues that arise inquantitative, qualitative and na~ative research, with some emphasis onthe autobiographical. That section will bynegotiation, reciprocity [and] empowerment. Although heisoften with interviewing, Iwill discuss Jerome Bruner further oninthe literature onmethodology. Qualitative Research, inparticular Narrative Autobiography, isthemost appropriate methodology forthis dissertation. Narrative analysis appears tobeparticularly well suited forinvestigating first-person accounts ofexperience and tothemultiple stories that will beintroduced inthis dissertation. Also, narrative dissertations, especially those based onthe use ofconstructionist theory, offer acontext toexamine experiences that azeoften private. Chapter Two: The Personal Nanative will deal with the Holocaust and thechild's experience ofthe waz. The autobiographical narrative will beinterspersed with constructionist descriptions oftheways meanings azeconstructed ininteraction with others.

Italso relates theways those beliefs azeconstantly reinforced inthenew contexts inwhich shefinds herself, through communications with absent parents and through thenon-verbal interaction with those who now people herlife. These beliefs, based onearly descriptions and originally constructed through therelationships with family members, including thestories onwhich shewas raised, remain embedded in 11thefamily's past and now, inthepresent, represent who [hey are. The narrative also takes upthemeaning that thechild gives toherseparation from herfamily, which is further storied bythefamily theme of specialness, combined with responsibility, re-storied inheradult life.

Chapter Three: The Professional Narrative will examine the major themes -the evolution oftheprofessional and theinfluences -that have guided myprocess of development. Some ofthese influences have emerged from thefield ofpsychology and psychiatry, others inthebeliefs and values co-constructed and guided during the child's formative years, thewar and thepost-war period during which identity was constructed. This section will also serve asthebridge between theearly and later 12experiences ofmylifeand their relevance Four: Transparency andThe Person OfThe Therapist: Identity, Memory Secrets, connect material ofthenarrative -the person ofthetherapist and The ofidentity entails how and who anindividual was and isand how that individual hasevolved, including theinfluence multiple inwhich theindividual works.

The following isabrief comparison between quantitative and qualitative research. The objective isforthis comparison toserve also asanintroduction tothemain text dealing with Nan ative Research with particular relevance totheuseofAutobiography inanarrative dissertation. Quantitative and Qualitative Reseazch represent two distinctively different ways of approaching and executing aresearch study. The former, embedded inthe more traditional methodology, although endowed with confidence forstudies focused on determining outcomes, depends onformulating, testing and measuring hypotheses through arigorous collection and analysis ofdata. For research tobevalued and trusted, one has historically required evidence that itwas grounded inalogical empiricism. Simply put, quantitative research isdeductive -itdetermines the relationship between one thing and another -itqualifies relationships between variables. Historically, ithasbeen thereliable method totest instruments that were, nevertheless, itwas also perceived tobe areliable method totestreplicability. The quantitative researcher seeks toquantify relationships between variables - weight, performance, time, etc. -which azemeasured onasample ofsubjects - tissues, cells, animals also bereferred toas observational, because itisbased onexamination without intervention. Although most often associated with studies that require lazger samples, they may also beassociated with descriptions ofone case, asone sometimes sees inthepsychiatric literature. No attempt ismade either orconditions -one measures things asthey there isnointervention; one describes what one \"sees\" isthere. The descriptive studies oftime that arenecessary toproduce thesought after results. Descriptive studies, for instance, ofspecific populations have produced very interesting and significant information onwhich one canbegin topredicate medical treatment, ecological experiments, and soforth. The results ofthese studies can be analyzed and use asabase forfurther research butthey cannot bechanged. An example would beGeorge Valiant's forty year study ofmales (Valiant, 1983). It stands aswritten andone cannot take outarandom section forfurther analysis. Inexperimental research, one may make useofineasurements and interventions for thepurpose ofcomparisons. The experimental study may useasmaller sample but, in itsmore sophisticated form, will also depend onsample groups -often randomly selected -aswell ascontrol groups. Experimental research usually includes anintervention and offers thepossibility of studying phenomena both before and after theexperimental intervention. Samples may besmall orlarge but usually include can still may also include apreand post test, asonesees indrug trials. The experimental research isvalued because statistics areperceived asmore reliable evidence fortheir objectivity. One assumes that you don't fudge numbers. And, like many professionals grounded inanacademic approach, ithasattimes uptoreplication with arepresentative population that would beuseful and also legitimize what was attempted- forreasons oftime, money and other resources -thedescriptive study has served asapartial solution. Experimental research, which may introduce anintervention -new medication, revised soil treatment orgenetic manipulation -has proved useful ingenerating information andhasalso been noted a.sashorter-term research tool. 15Although quantitative research remains thestandard fornumerous relevant studies, its primary ofsubjectivity inany experiment quantitative reseazch canbevaluable increating `snapshots' ofcertain phenomena and trends, working behind orbecause ofspecific phenomena: theadditional awareness ofwhat's atthistime andatthisplace andwith agiven population. Asatherapist and academic, Ihave benefited from using quantitative studies, both descriptive and experimental, tosupport theshort term `action research' that Ihave devised particularly with issues related toalcoholism (Borwick and Roussaux, 1989). Qualitative Research isaninductive research method which aims toprovide anin- depth understanding ofpeople's experiences, perspectives andhistories inthecontext oftheir situations and settings. One ofthecharacteristics ofthis choice ofreseazch isaconcern with exploring information from theperspective of those being studied. Qualitative research methodology relies primarily on unstructured techniques which aze, nevertheless, sensitive tothesocial context ofthe study. Ifconducted inasystematic and perceptive fashion, isrich aswell ascomplex. Itisnecessary tobeawaze ofthesocial that one toconduct a may bethemethod ofchoice.

Although the methodology may vary significantly from that employed byquantitative researchers, and may attimes prove more difficult toexpress, that methodology needs tobestated. Qualitative research, which hascome along way inlegitimizing studies derived from thesocial sciences - psychology, anthropology, education- employees avariety ofinethods, forabroad range ofpurposes, including exploratory interviews, observation, conversation, storying, discourse and narrative analysis (Mishler, 1986, Bruner, 2002, McAdams, 1993, Gilmore, 2001, Ellis and Bochner, 1992, Sandelowski,1991). Based on constructionist world view. NARRATIVE PSYCHOLOGY AND RESEARCH: THE NARRATNE DISSERTATION Narrative psychology may bedescribed asreferring toaviewpoint 1986; research isthestudy ofhuman behavior. Doctoral dissertations have traditionally been based onaquantitative study that is further validated bystatistical information. Narrative studies that employ the qualitative format ofreseazch have been utilized inrecent years inthesocial sciences, psychology, anthropology and particularly education. This hasproven tobeabenefit toresearchers and students alike inthat into azeas such asmeaning andrelationships that require analternative lens of inquiry. Although this dissertation deals minimally with interviewing, narrative interviews have become more appreciated asa\"form ofdiscourse, ajoint product of what interviewees and interviewers talk about together and how they talk with each other ... itreveals our theoretical assumptions and presuppositions about relations between discourse and meaning\" (Bruner, 1986). 17Mishler (1991) juxtaposes this form ofinterview interpretation with thetraditional interview where questions and answers aretreated asinformation gathering and at another level asaway ofstimulating responses. Asquestions build oneonanother, a picture would eventually emerge ofaproblem oropinion, both drawn bythe interviewer who both directs the discourse and assigns meaning aspart ofthe exchange. (As aclinician who hasspent many years interviewing psychiatric patients, Ioften had thesense oftheinterview, already intheinitial stages, validating rather than testing ahypothesis about theproblem. This became even more rigidified asthe determined theboundary andlanguage forhuman conduct, there has been anexpressed need tofind ways of developing new tools fordiscourse.

Afocal point ofa narrative approach may bepeople's expression oftheir experience oflifeand their interpretations ofthese experiences. Itisinthis actofinterpreting that one gives meaning toone's experience and, atthesame time, begins tomake sense ofthat experience -putitinto some semblance oforder foroneself. Narrative has also been described asnot fixed inmeaning that happens tohim through them, and hetries tolive his own live andto attempt anunderstanding and explanation ofhow certain experiences may lead to important realizations and conclusions about one's life. Inthenarrative story about oneself, there isthe further possibility torecord this knowledge asconfirming evidence ofournewly minted understanding. Autobiography takes onthe task ofexamining this meaning ofour experience. However, each separate narrative account, byitsvery nature, touches onalarger domain ofrelationships. ofautobiographical writing -telling one's own story asitwere - although broadly accepted isnotwithout debate. Focault suggests that it'samethod of becoming \"other experience tothe that self (p.2).Hegces ontosay that who once and who wearetoday...tends tomake our sense ofself inany present moment seem more unified and organized that itispossible (it)could be.\" We 19organize Chapters and Three -thePersonal and Professional Narrative -Ire-examined my eazlier comments about autobiography.

Because any story ofsurvival isastory about relationships, this has further required areflexive process ofsense making and influence that extends beyond thechildhood experience.

Ataminimum war interrupts achild's growth and theevent that informed mychildhood aswell of24,000 other young Jewish survivors (Laqueue, 2001), requires acapital letter..

What was lost aretherelationships, thenormality oflife inasituation that never bydeath, still able tocare forothers, andindoing so, maintaining their humanity. Inthegenocide ofWorld War II,Jewish children were not caught upinanadult confrontation. They were supposed todie, aNazi strategy toridtheworld ofJewry. (Landau, 1992). Less than one inten Jewisch children who lived inGerman- controlled Europe during thewar years survived -1,200,000 were massacred.Those survived didsowith disguised identities, \"passing\" asAryans, inconstant danger ofdiscovery, often speaking anew language, responding toanew name and concealing physical characteristics that might reveal that they were Jewish. They lived hidden inclosets, attics, cellars, sewers and forests, separated from orabandoned by theparents who were picked uponstreets orinsystematic house searches and taken away tolabor and concentration camps. The children survived through their own 22resourcefulness -until they were captured and died. There areprobably many, uncounted, who have lived outtheir lives notknowing that they were born Jewish. They represent, inpart, theremainders offamilies who perished. There azeothers who may have been told, without proof, that their families haddied, and some instances of children who may have chosen nottoleave their adoptive families and have, ina sense, stayed hidden fortheremainder oftheir lives. Ofthehidden, there were what have been called the\"visible\" and the\"invisible.\" (Marks, 1993) InFrance and Holland, forinstance, thevisible kept byfamilies, often onfarms, and lived more orless intheopen, with some neighbors knowing that they were Jews. The very young could attimes bepassed offaslegitimate offspring; were hidden away, inghettos and concentration camps aswell asin any corner that would conceal them. Sometimes they were hidden with aparent or other family member. Even ifthey were placed with gentiles, noone knew oftheir existence. They razely, ifever, leftthehouse. Those who were concealed byreligious institutions could fallinto either category. They toowere always indanger. Although some ofthose who hidthechildren risked their lives and were kind and caring, there were also individuals who were well paid. Sometimes they took their responsibility seriously, atother times the children were indanger from their supposed protectors. The stories ofactual abuse tend tobeheard more often by therapists. The children didnotoften complain, during orafter. Many oftheinvisible hidden, like myself, chose tobelieve that their parents were alive and would eventually come togetthem, even though inmany instances, they could notbecertain. The Kindertransport (Harris, Oppenheimer, 2001), which was theBritis government's shocked response tothehorror ofKristallnacht, saved 10,000 children from Austria, Germany and Czechoslovakia and brought them toGreat Britain, with theagreement ofthegovernment, asacondition ofacceptance. They traveled on tourist visas, and their care and education were guazanteed byprivate organizations. They were also toemigrate from one that agreed upon byHitler and encouraged actively bysome, ifnot all, members ofthe Nazi hierarchy, most particulazly Goebbels (Laquer, 2000). There appeaz tobetwo reasons why on November 10, 1939, inanorchestrated operation throughout Germany, party members, Gestapo, theNazi Labor Front andother authorized and unauthorized thugs and ru~ans, roamed through thestreets, looting anddestroying Jewish-owned stores, shattering windows, buming homes and synagogues, ransacking and terrorizing dwellings, destroying sacred objects andrecords and murdering anyJews who crossed their path. Over 200 Jews were slaughtered, another 20,000 were deported, 300 synagogues were razed and over 7000 businesses were destroyed. This act was explained asareprisal against aworldwide conspiracy ofJews tostrike against the very heart oftheGerman nation.

Nevertheless, theresponse toKristallnacht was oneofoutrage, even amongst many Germans, and inthefuture such excesses were conducted only when they could beunobserved, ormore discreetly denied bythepopulace. 24Great Britain, although with itsown history ofanti-Semitism, acted onitsoutrage by easing immigration restrictions forcertain categories ofJewish refugees. Among the results was theKindertransport, aconsequence oftheinsistence ofseveral charitable organizations, including theQuakers.

Another somewhat explanation is that intheneed \"Other\", their difference becoming anobject ofexploitation fortheNazis whose long-term goal from the beginning was totake over allofEurope and beyond.

The perpetual loneliness Ihave lived ceilings allseemed very fazaway and, although many people lived among these walls, forsome reason Idon't remember agreat deal ofmovement orverbal exchange. Itseems that lifewas conducted inwhispers, and although there was nodoubt considerable interaction, Iwas kept very separate from allactivity that didnotdirectly involve tothedegree that it was possible. Itwas probably hazd topredict what information people might offer up indire situations. 31The activity that Iwas aware of-from Iuse removal because itwas clear tomethat their departure was notoftheir own choosing. Sick people were moved tothe\"hospital\" (a euphemism) from which even Iknew they would notreturn. Others were ledaway, protesting, weeping quietly orintotal silence. Itwas who remonstrated, pleaded andheld ontoeither theguard ortheindividual that was being taken. These were thescenes that disturbed me, forwhich Inever asked an explanation. There was nodiscussion: noreasons given, none asked. We lived inshared rooms, often more than one family inacertain space, our existences constructed around aseries ofbeds.

This continued tobetrue forthe rest ofmylife. The only reference toloss was forpeople, never about possessions. Things were replaceable. People were not. Iwas rarely leftalone intheghetto.

As the men began togather the other children towards the door, I remonstrated with them that they couldn't take myfriends because Iwas toolittle to stay bymyself. My German hero agreed and sowewere spared, this time. This incident isolated meeven further from theother children. Isuspect that since Ihad no clear understanding ofthedanger, Itrusted thekindness theGermans had always shown me.

One day, some men arrived with astretcher and took her away \"tothehospital,\" But asIwas tolearn was legs and The daughter was also crying while shetried tohold hermother back.

Asone ofthefew blond- haired females inthefamily, Ihad always coveted dark hair. My Aryan appearance may have saved mylifebutcaused menoend ofidentity problems. However, the daughter would never speak tome, and although Iwould sometimes seeherlooking into ofthevigilance Isaw andheard more than they thought, although didn't necessarily understand allofitorimagine what itmeant. One day Iheard a woman shouting and crying outside, and when Ilooked out, leaning forward and standing onmytces, Icould seeauniformed person holding achild, swinging itinthe scenes that puzzled me, butwhen Iheazd a bigbang and saw someone fall, Ibegan torealize that they had been shot and that meant that they would notgetupagain. 34What few elderly people Isaw seemed todisappear. Looking day when Iwas alone, Icould seeguazds leading asmall group. They walked slowly, some with difficulty, and Irecognized several that lived somewhere near ourroom. The guards would shout, prod and someone would fall. They walked until they were beyond myview. Itwas oneofthefew times that oldpeople, although Iknew very few. There was atall, graceful lady with beautiful swept-back white hair. She always wore adark dress of some soft fabric, which swayed gently asshemoved.

What seemed like much later Icould hear myadults speaking softly toeach other, referring toherand mentioning myname. They decided tome,andIofcourse never asked. Tothebest ofmyknowledge, Ileftourbuilding and theghetto grounds twice, both times under acoat, bound tomymother's body, with sisters asPraetorian guides on each side. The first time was thesortie tothebroom factory towhich mymother, a skilled yeazs ofmylife. Ibecame brought forth pre-penicillin days, gave blood.

Since finances rather than trust oraffinity were thebasis ofthis transaction, part ofthearrangement was that theanonymous trustees would supervise mywell-being from adistance, and should any harm befall me, theremaining moneys would beused topursue and punish anyone who harmed me. This last part was decided when myfather and some ofthetrustees finally met theman with whom I was tolive. However, bythen itwas much too late.

She was theshortest person Ihad ever known, notmuch taller than Iwas, and also atfirst view, thefiercest. She was the best grandmother Icould have had and, indirectly, my presence nodoubt contributed toherfinal confrontation with her son, and herdeath.

My father must have explained that Nicola, then inhislate teens, was somewhat past the age ofapprenticeship, and that there was theadditional difficulty that myfather had 39noboarding facilities.

Butbefore went into hiding onthefarm mymother had runaway from concentration camp brought meanings. Many ofthechildren were in hiding with pazents, others were orphaned and some had been given away orplaced with families, churches and charitable institutions.

When mychildren were told thestory ofAnne Frank and visited theplace where shehid, they came tomyfather with sadtales ofhersuffering. My father, who judged the attic inAmsterdam that concealed the Frank family asagreat 40improvement onthehole underground that housed us,informed them that I,their had suffered more.

She had apunitive sense of humor that compensated itlacked ingentleness. She most ofallabout theloss ofthemother she idealized when she was eight years old and her mother was forty-eight. About her father she was more ambivalent. She had craved hisattention. She was thepretty daughter, where Celia was theresponsible eldest child, andoften feltthat hehad spent more time looking after hispatients than hegave tothefamily. When Jews were not allowed topractice medicine, my grandmother opened abarbershop and hired a barber inorder toconvince theauthorities that mygrandfather was notareal doctor. Nevertheless, thefarmers leftchickens, eggs and vegetables outside their doorway and still came inthemiddle ofthenight with their ailments.

My mother came tohelp with her adored grandson and heard that there was aphysician from herhometown who might beable tocure me.Noappointment was necessary. The doctor, asmall man inhislate sixties orearly seventies, slightly bent with wispy white hair, greeted mymother, kissed herhands andexpressed had helped him toestablish apractice inadifficult environment and who had taught him \"totreat tothesoul.\" My grandfather also liked todrink, asubject bymy mother. An example ofthis protective shield that hiswife and daughters had drawn around this habit was toreappear many years later, during myson's bris orcircumcision.

Mygrandmother, after whom Iwas named, hasbeen described tomeasanimposing woman ofmany talents, who was remembered forherkindness and respected for being alady. She had suffered several miscarriages and had delivered two stillborn babies before and after giving birth toCelia and mymother. Itwas apparently her dowry that had paid forthelarge white house onthehilland thebake oven where the less fortunate townspeople could bake their bread and keep their food warm forthe Sabbath.

My mother may have been unsure ofherfather but sheadored this mother whom shelost toheart age, andcried forher, even when, asanadult, sheherself was stricken with multiple sclerosis that was todestroy her.

The Courage ofOthers: Hiding -The Last Phase This phase ofourlifeinhiding was outthat Iwas nolonger thesame child that shehad cried over and given away. The once familiar threesome offather, mother and mewas nolonger sufficient. We knew bythen that Celia was probably theonly one still alive, butevery effort that Nicola had made tomeet her near thegates oftheconcentration camp had come tonothing. My mother gradually 49stopped waiting inanticipation, and Ilearned quickly nottoaskquestions. Somehow, along and and gone outof our lives. Inretrospect, were less thesurvivors and more something that somehow gotleftbehind. There was little rejoicing inthisreunion. Mymother movies shehad seen, buttheplayfulness that litherfrom inside was never to return. Italways seemed tomethat my mother considered living outher lifewithout her and brothers asaquestionable survival. shedidn't even considered quite fortunate tohave come through thewar asaunit. For me, especially, having two parents suggested aform ofnormality, agift that not allother children had. My parents would have noother children. Although my mother became pregnant somewhere between Poland andGermany, shehad anabortion.

They still shazed information with me, asked myopinion and involved meintheir discussions about how much money wehadandhow wewould spend it,butthere were twomajor factors over which Ihad The first was mymother's abortion. Suddenly, mymother had tostay in bed and the sheets and her nightgown were stained with blood. Iaccepted the explanation that she had arather large `bubu' (sore) and even insisted that from Lvov, Horodenka, and Obertin who happened tobepassing town. pazents there was therestrained joyofseeing orhearing about oldfriends: finding out who was alive, who wasn't, where they were and how they had survived. My pazents became reacquainted with theworld that they and inthefuture. Idon't remember feeling left outbutIvery much recall feelings ofintrusion. The ultimate indignity was that inournew housing, because ofa lack ofbeds, Ihadbeen assigned acrib that was two feet shorter than Iwas. Since I usually attempted tosleep with myparents, this affront was minimised. However, when thevisitors were inresidence, my obligation noidea else slept and, inlater yeazs wondered whether Iwas being protected insome way. The visitors were only passing through, buttheir andnolonger knew how to take up. Iwas toleazn not much later that many ofthese people were trading intheblack market. Ithad something todowith crossing theboarder illegally into Russia toeither sell orbuy yeast, and return toPoland with other unavailable goods, including, I believe, nylon stockings. They were earning agreat deal ofmoney, and since Atfirst wewere very poor. Mymother shopped every day and had tocalculate very carefully how much shespent foreach meal. There Iwent with fellinlove with adoll that braided hair and blue eyes. Ihad learned nottoaskforanything, butitdidn't require formymother torecognise the longing ofachild who hadn't owned atoy since she was two years old. I remember her looking atme ruefully and telling me that wewould beeating mamaliga (cooked corn meal) forthe next two weeks. a 51daughter Better toventure towhat was tobecome theIron Curtain andvisit theNana andherfamily.

Apparently, they were nervous about hisvisit but were pleased tohave theextra money. My father half laughingly told usthat Nana's husband was content that the additional money allowed him toplan foramore important monument forhisgrave. Itseems cleaz inretrospect that tohave improved our economic situation, inspite ofwhat dealing intheblack market implied both certain that heintended tocontinue this pursuit, and several times my mother was also tocross over while hestayed with me. Suddenly, Ihadagovemess who, along with theother two children, would take meto thepark, play games and take upmysadly neglected education. Since myparents were busy plotting their illegal trade, Iatebymyself, inanearby restaurant, where I was served asifIwere and limited starched cloth and napkin, suggestions made byablack-clad waiter. Iremember loving thesilver domes that covered the dishes and tried toselect meals that would require this necessary accoutrement. Ihad learned how todine formally from thegrandmother when Iwas inhiding, and managed with pride, ifnotnecessarily skill, themultiple knives, forks and glasses with which Iwas confronted ateach meaL Isaw less I remember loving alloftheformality, thebeautifully served meals, theproper new clothes and having books, although Ihave noidea inwhich language Iwas reading then. Atsome point inmylifeImust have read abitofRussian, perhaps some Polish which Ihad just begun tospeak and definitely Yiddish, which Icould read butnot speak and only understood because Ispoke German. Infact German was still my language ofchoice, but Iwas todiscover that, like many wartime children, Iwas linguistically flexible. Itsaddens methat, although Istill speak have themultitude oflanguages towhich Ihadbeen introduced. Myparents spoke German tomeand German, toeach other, depending on whether they wanted metounderstand -ornot. When Istarted school inMontreal I was humiliated that Ispoke only thebitofEnglish Ihad been taught before weleft Germany. With great determination, Idecided tospeak only English until Iwas fluent. And pushed alloftheother languages, along with many ofthememories about which Iamnow writing, outofmyconscious mind, aswell asoutofmylife. One other event always stands out inmymind. Itwas New Year's Eve and my pazents went out fortheevening without me. When they retumed, Iremember so cleazly, they were flushed and their skin andclothing feltcool asthey embraced and kissed me. Without myasking, they told methat they had taken afiacre (horse and buggy) ride through town toseeintheNew Yeaz. Ihave always hugged that memory tomyself. There was something wonderful about my parents inahorse-driven carriage, just thetwo ofthem alone. that Ididn't understand in 53any case. The classrooms were designed for adolescents and young adults and although attendance was notcompulsory atseven oreight years, Iwas often theonly absentee. Private mefrom therest ofthepopulation, with the exception oftwo orthree children who, although older, became companions ofsorts. Myparents were concerned topreserve what was leftofmynaivet\u00e9. ashort stay because myfather was todirect atheatre group and was also given the responsibility ofwelcoming and co-ordinating some ofthe entertainment that arrived from America. Again, two events stand outinmymemory. The first, which took place inEinring, I treasure because forthevery first time, possibly Alazge group ofpeople inthecamp inthemiddle evidently been travelling foralong time and noprovisions had been made toeither myfather hadcarried sleeping, offlour, near theoven. Iremember lying [here, inhaling thesmells of food being freshly prepared, bread baking, coffee brewing, thesoft hum ofvoices and my mother efficiently bustling azound the kitchen, her movements asalways economical, giving theodd instruction bending down tosleep andInever wanted toleave that kitchen orhave anything change again. The second event was aPassover Seder, attended byabout thirty people.9 State ofIsrael was still tobeestablished, butthese were Jews who had survived thedeath camps and were determined togettoEretz (Hebrew forIsrael). They were being detained in Cyprus and living without food ontheships that hadcarried them. Some ofthem had left from ourcamp, including some children. For us,even uschildren, thePassover readings were ofastory that was was ever tohave again, orberemembered tofifty later was thenext Seder that was tohave meaning inmy life. We were five, myeldest son and hiswife, myhusband and Iand, ofcourse, my father. We knew that hewas dying andthat this would beourlastPassover with him. My husband began conducting the Seder and then turned tomyfather and asked whether hewould like tolead instead. My father took theHaggada (Passover prayer book) and started reading, butsoon itbecame very clear that hewas speaking from mewith place known asGabersee hadbeen apsychiatric facility, anold-fashioned asylum which probably included retarded aswell as psychiatric patients. The buildings were mostly three- and four-storey red brick structures, surrounded bystraggly green grass, resembling insome ways aneglected campus. Welived intheadministration building because director and were able tohave aroom forourselves. That building itself was two stories with offices onthefirst floor, assigned tothedirectors whose families lived on thesecond floor. Our room was about tenfeet wide and quite long. Our beds were lined upagainst opposite walls near thewindow, with thetwo-burner electric stove onwhich my mother prepared full meals. Across from that was an improvised bed which served asasofa and made upour living room. Although the bathrooms were shared, Iremember them asspotlessly clean. There was acommunity kitchen which provided meals fortheresidents, butwenever atethere. The camp provided, along with shelter, aretraining programme fortheadults and a school forthechildren aswell asforyoung adults whose studies had been interrupted bythewar. There were numerous classes, buttheprimary occupation formany ofthe inhabitants was inplanning either theUnited States, Israel orCanada. T'here may have been other destinations, butIdidn't hear about 55them. The way outtoNorth America required visas with relatives asguazantors certain Inthe latter case, Ibelieve theneed driven byJIAS (Jewish Immigrant Aid Services) and possibly UNRRA United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) workers who recognised the necessity ofresettling these thousands ofpeople. Ihave noidea whether Canada was indesperate need oftailors, but that was one method through which many people gained entry, including myfamily. Israel, asadestination, was both areason toleave aswell asapassionate desire for many, my mother among them. Idon't know whether she had heazd offriends or acquaintances who had managed represented aform ofretum totheshtetl, acommunal way oflifethat was more rural and where relationships were less formal. Achaverai (Hebrew for `group offriends'). My mother needed people. For my father, acommunal life inIsrael had absolutely no appeal. Already inthecamp, hewould point out, thewhole system was based on protectia (influence); who you knew and your place inthe hierazchy determined where and how you lived, how soon your papers were considered and even access to clothing and other necessities from UNRRA and other sources. Healso refused the visas that were toarrive from mymother's family because, although hewanted tolive unmanageable, and, captured bymymother's family. This argument between myparents was torage for months. There was very limited entry toIsrael before 1948, and those who tried togothere risked their lives, asships were diverted toCyprus orother destinations where they lingered without food ornecessary besafe inacountry ofourown. Among theyounger people, there agreement forone's survival was inevitable, asmany ofthem seemed tobelieve it was, doing soforone's own country was theonly solution. This spirit was further bolstered bytheZionist organisations that were gradually beginning toreappeaz and make overtures, especially totheyoung adults. Ofcourse, this was with theUNcharter tothelittle state ofIsrael 1948. somewhere inthemiddle ofGermany. Noone seemed tobeindoors like waves ifitwere tobenegative. And how everyone danced and cheered andhugged. What a wonderful place itwas tobeonMay 14, 1948 inadisplaced person's camp somewhere inthe middle ofGermany when your people toIsrael was not immediate because the mandate did not permit foran immediate influx ofpeople. Also formany thetraditional Passover greeting of`next year inJerusalem' was not their true wished-for destination. And visas tothe Americas were still difficult toobtain. Therefore the daily preoccupation forthe adults ofthinking about, ifnot always working towazds, their future destinations, continued. ADifferent Kind ofChildhood Even though Iwas only eight, Ihad two occupations atthetime. One was theself- selected one ofhanging around thetheatre where my father rehearsed hisplayers. I would sitinacomer hanging ontoeach word and every instruction. From time to time Iwould forget myself and prompt one oftheactors, only tobereminded Icame down with mumps and thus ended my theatrical career. The plays were onforaweek and were attended bypeople from other camps also. My father, Iwas todiscover later, took considerable poetic license, especially when herewrote thestage play. My husband, who was teaching English literature atMcGill University when hefirst saw my father's scripts, informed me that, among other changes, myfather had given `The Weavers' (Hauptmann, 1892) a happy ending, including apazade. Itseems that happy endings, preferably heroic ones, were what myfather surmised hisaudience wanted and needed. 57My other occupation with theGerman farmers intheneighbourhood - clothing andcigarettes important, Iwas anunintimidated negotiator. Ihad an added advantage ofbeing angry. My anger hadtwo sources. Iwas often mistaken for aGerman child and sometimes would bestopped inthecamp bystrangers who thought Ihad mistakenly wandered intoaplace where Ididnotbelong. The second source was mydifficulty over language. The common language oftheother children incamp was Yiddish, although anumber spoke Polish orHungarian. My primary language was still German, which helped metounderstand their Yiddish, butwhen I attempted theyoungest children inthecamp. Ididn't seem tofitanywhere and the only people who thought Iwas more like them were theGermans, who were not especially well liked asagroup bythecamp inhabitants. The German farmers were probably atfirst amused bythepint-sized negotiator but eventually took me seriously, and Icame home with whatever vegetables were available, fruit andtheoccasional meat andeggs that mymother would prepare with herusual skill. part Iliked least were thetimes Ihadtodigtheroot vegetables outofthefield andcarry them home. was free, hewould sometimes meet meand carry back myload. There were also times when Iwould diginthefield, accompanied bymymother, without permission. Sometimes wewould pick berries, butmymother would rarely leave thecamp ofstudy. Infact, thecurriculum inthe camp's school was designed forpupils who myage. Along with reading, writing andarithmetic, allofwhich Ienjoyed, wewere taught trigonometry, algebra, biology and Hebrew. The atmosphere intheone-room class was alive with flirting and sexual tension that were appropriate fortheolder teenagers and young adults but had little relevance tomy day dreams ofeither being anactress or sent byrelatives America 58plump chicken. The other school that Iattended only onFridays, although attendance was required daily, was cheder (religious school). Each Friday afternoon, however, thechildren were awazded tickets tobuy diligently, and therabbi, smart man that hewas, must have decided that studying oneday was better than nothing. Ialso studied violin, and Imention mylessons fortwo reasons. The first isbecause myGerman violin teacher, whom Inodoubt exasperated, told myparents that clear tohim that Ihated everything and everyone German. This remark puzzled meatthetime because Iwas sooften taken foraGerman myself that what aform ofself hate. Being mistaken foraGerman child intheDP camp was unpleasant ifnot dangerous, and this happened tomeoften enough topossibly make mewish to differentiate myself from myteacher Idon't feeling azeendangered more often athome, rehearsing new plays, participating intheadministration ofthecamp and greeting visitors from thevarious organisations and theAmerican Groups ofchildren would bebrought out entertain and Iwould inevitably be invited tosing mysignature song ofthelittle boy who given Iwas often presented asevidence ifone ofthegoals ofshowing clothing, food and books forthechildren. Iwas mostly well dressed, a Zworn obsession, helped along bythefact that both ofmyparents could sew. Iwas better fedthan most and had first access toany books and magazines that appeazed at thecamp because Ilived daily out ifanything ofinterest had arrived. Life magazine was adiscovery I cherished because, assomeone once said, itwas Chicklets gum which jokingly because she insisted that Iwas themost avid reader inthe camp. There were other children inthecamp who probably spent more time with each other and even attended school regularly. My closest relationships were with thethree who lived onmyfloor: Lonka, four orfive years older, atallgirland also anonly child with very tall and serious parents. Nathan, who lived with his widowed and enterprising mother and was tosuffer from severe emotional problems, and Yosie, who was probably only two orthree years older. Nathan and Yosie were both eventually atleast ayeaz ormore But none ever friends. Perhaps weahd learned from our pazents that friendship could mean loss. The pattern ofbeing aloner was unplanned. Having spent somuch time alone, tohave leamed, from inpart inaseparate world. Ivery much like being with people, Ilove myfriends and make new acquaintances easily butmy entire life has made that more ofaluxury than routine. Having moved often asanadult hasmade itdifficult and South Africa. Inlooking back, Irealize that myparents maintained contact with very few people after they would move away. Allofthose families and friends that they hadbeen close toinKiev orLodz, thetwo camps where wehad lived andeven some acquaintances from before the war, went out ofour lives and Inolonger even remember their names. Irecognise three families from Gabersee inmy wedding pictures, thepeople wecame tolike. Goodbyes aretobeavoided because itis probably forever. The past has stayed with meinother, more poignant ways. Asachild you rarely analyse how youareperceived byadults. Because Istrongly resemble myfather, total strangers inlater years would stop meandtellmesomething about myself asachild. Some were [hevisitors from Lodz, others from Horodenka. The message was most clearly delivered bythewoman ofacouple who lived inMontreal andwife inthewar, had met after liberation from orother and had lived together inGabersee Imet Lisa, forthat was her name, walking near my parents' house some yeazs after I myself nolonger lived inMontreaL She took myarm, and crying, informed methat she was pleased that Ihad turned out well, That Iwas never toforget that Ialso live and remember us\", she told me, `We also will live through you. Itwill allhave been forsomething\". This was notanisolated incident. Sometimes Horodenka survivors wanted tosee mebecause they said that Iwas all that was leftofthenext generation that would have been. Ontheoccasions that my husband was with me when Iwould beconfronted with such amessage, his astonished reaction made meawaze ofthefact that noteveryone lived with such a responsibility. Until then, Ihad consciously notregarded such encounters asunusual. These yeazs inGermany were happy ones forme, also because my father seemed content and my mother atpeace. However, my mother was beginning toshow concern time forusto leave foramore permanent home. And rather than make useofthevisas available to usfortheUnited States, myfather, ever theindependent, decided ifthey never came tobelieve inhisqualification, and wewere issued before Ileftforwhat hewas would First wetravelled through Germany. Bavaria was abeautiful part ofthecountry when seen from aproper train. We explored Munich and other cities that had notbeen devastated byAllied bombs. However, what stands outinmymemory isVienna and theOpera House. The Vienna Opera House, Ihave since discovered, was located next tothehotel that was occupied bytheGerman command. The Opera House had 61therefore suffered several direct hits during thebombing. When myfather and I, dressed inourbest, went totheOpera inthefallof1948, thebuilding was probably in the process ofbeing rehabilitated. All Iremember are the red plush seats, the formality oftheevent, themusic and finally thesinging. Many years later Iwas to return totheopera with myhusband and stay inthevery hotel that had been Nazi headquarters during theoccupation. The stairway was stilldecorated with paintings of soldiers. Iassumed that these soldiers were Austrian andthat their military -these ever stirmyimaginations asdidattending myfirst opera inthepartially destroyed Vienna Opera house. We visited Salzburg and travelled through themountains ofBertchesgaden (Bavaria), how Asmychildren would doeventually, complain mealways asawarm remembrance. The prepazation forour departure involved endless paper work. The reason that I remember this isbecause my father kept modifying the information, asking my mother and menottoforget thenew data, only tochange itanew. Ifheheard a rumour that older children were more easily passed through thestringent immigration requirements, Iwould suddenly gain ayeaz. When having been inhiding during the war was suspect, our entire history was upforreview. Former illness was always suspect; therefore wewere topresent ourselves asnewly hatched eggs, never having experienced asmuch asacommon cold. My mother would laugh atallofthis preventive activity, butmyfather would quickly lose histemper with both ofus. There followed afluny oftrips and consultations asmyfather attempted topredict the unpredictable. Somewhere, hewas sure, someone hadtheanswers anditwas essential that hefind this someone who would advise him. Ihadn't seen this uncertain, anxious side were tobecome very familiar, thefirst being especially in-itating. Suddenly, there was a`them' who knew more than myfather and Ididn't like were again, Ihave nomemory from where wewould boazd aship that would take Nova Scotia, theentry point into Canada. Hamburg Weleftthecamp inDecember, 1948, and were nottoleave Germany until sometime inJanuary of1949. This was probably due toacombination ofthetime ittook to process everyone and possibly also ofaship. For thefirst time Iwas confronted bymasses ofpeople who came from other camps, and other individuals who wished togotoCanada. Two events stay with me ashaving had, directly orindirectly, long-term consequences, although both arerelated insome tochanges inHamburg, where wewere toremain forseveral weeks. Ellis Island had served asaport ofarrival fordetermining who could stay intheUnited States, inGermany these processing decisions were made atthe point ofdeparture. Unlike Ellis Island, noadequate preparations appear tohave been made forthemasses that descended onthisplace. Our first introduction was tobeled toavery large room with lines upon lines ofbeds that were accessed through one doorway. Asthecrowds milled with their belongings inhand, oneofmypazents must have asked metorunahead and procure thenecessary beds, which Isucceeded in doing. AsIreached abed against thewall, which Ihad been taught from long who had struck me, while heshouted back inacleazly unrepentant voice. Rather than feaz, Iremember clearly asense ofenormous outrage. Ihadn't pushed ahead simply moved more quickly because Iwasn't encumbered byparcels. This was important tomebecause my mother, concerned about adistinct lack ofmanners among many survivors, hadgiven mestrict instructions onhow tohold myplace with determination but without aggression. Idecided then and there that, whenever possible, Iwould dowhat Ideemed necessary nottobepushed aside. This, combined continuing anxiety about whether wewould bedeemed worthy ofimmigration. Every rumour about who was accepted and why someone was rejected resulted inanew flurry ofinstructions tomeand my dejour. Wewere given somany new instructions that mymother Ifelt asifallofhisanxiety was transferred tome. Somehow, ifwedidn't pass itwould all bemyfault. The more mymother was able whatever was going on,themore forways tokeep myhusband and children safe from the Nazis who were chasing us.Iwould seek out routes through people's gardens, empty attics and other hideaways, inorder toevade the enemy. One dream had merevisit thesame apartment building night after night in order tofind thebest path. Sometimes Iwould wake upcrying out, butusually I would find myself inbed whimpering. These were also thetypes ofdreams that you couldn't leave even ifyou knew that dreaming: itwould allbegin again as soon asyou fellasleep. gradually, andaltogether after myfather died. Itwasn't until mychildren were adults and pointed outtomejust how often Iwould overreact insome situation that didn't warrant excessive concern that Iatleast became aware ofthis anxiety, My youngest son would attimes remind me that 64whatever that Iwas rushing towards oraway was notthelastboat But itoften felt And somehow Iwas responsible for everyone's safety. Being inHamburg was otherwise rather amusing. There were other children myage andthere were also infants who had been born after thewar. Iremember being drawn tothebabies, because they, like theelderly, were altogether new tome. There was a distinct lack ofprivacy, butthis was one population that was inured tocanying out acts inpublic places. was innoway modified forcivilian passengers, forfamilies with children. Thus the men and women were segregated for thetwo-week journey, although those ofuswho were able would eventually meet inacommon dining area formeals. After thesecond day atsea, not many presented themselves forthe questionable cuisine, although thechurning waters contributed more totheir absence than thequality ofthefood. For this particular journey anadventure. agirlofmyown agewho myparents norIknew where wewere going toreside. Ontario and Quebec, which istosay, Toronto and Montreal, were theplaces ofchoice, because they were urban centers andmyfather didnotcare forsmall towns. Noone seemed interested in theprovinces further tothesouthwest, which were theones that infact were looking toincrease their population. My father was hesitant about theprovince ofQuebec because itwould mean that Iwould also need tolearn French. Itseems difficult toimagine what hopes and threats this new destination held formy parents. For myfather, who hadn't worked ofmy knowledge, henever itand certainly never complained. On the ship, heseemed tohave recovered some ofhisentrepreneurial skill and even theswells ofavery rough sea, Iranazound with mynew friends, exploring every corner ofthevessel, telling my poor seasick mother and anyone who cared tolisten what was being served inthe kitchen andbeing ageneral nuisance. Atlast, Iwas ourquarters were notlarge orluxurious, even adilapidated boat was better than the large dormitory we had only recently vacated. My father was still preoccupied with thefuture, butforabrief period, theworries were onother people's shoulders than mine. ofthepassengers were too illtobother thinking about what layahead. Infact they quite prepared togive upanythoughts oflife after this seavoyage ifthey were delivered from their misery. Eventually wehad a glimpse ofEngland, which must have been reassuring tothose who doubted that land still existed, and much later wewere tosight what Ithink must have been Prince Edward Island. The new world was just ahead, and gradually people who had disappeared below deck from thebeginning ofthetripbegan toreappeaz. Itwas much less funhaving them around, attempting once more totake charge, butitwas nice to seemymother feeling well enough tobrush putonafresh herbythehand and show Briefly, Iwas theultimate authority what was toknow about theS.S. General Sturgiss, aship that weheazd didmymother weused thevisas that were sent byherfamily, we would have benefited from amuch more elegant passage. Instead wearrived lazgely because friends ofthefamily, who had ]eftEurope after theFirst World War, had arrived atourport ofentry topersuade mypazents that they needed tomake their lives where they had landslite (those people who came from thesame town orregion). My pazents' friends, the Schaffers, almost got from Montreal ahead ofus,with awelcome that toremain aswarm throughout the Celia's best friend, and hersister and mymother had been equally close. The only survivor from either family was theyoung man who had caught mewhen I fellofthetrain allthose years ago. They were determined that wecome toMontreal, and Abie, who was adesigner ofinen's clothing, had already asked thepeople he worked fortohire myfather. There seemed little mypazents could add. My mother was delighted tofind herself with friends. Since myfather didn't have was fierce. They were not pretentious people, butthey were proud. These established Canadian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, these landslite, who with some exceptions had lefttheir small towns atavery young age without education ormeans, had prospered. What these friends failed orrefused to grasp was that intheintervening years mypazents hadcontinued their education, and, having never been poor, were less sobythetime that thewar started. Yet wewere liketrophies, salvaged from thedevastation, expected toabide byanunderstanding of Europe that these people had left behind before they were fully grown. The outpouring ofgenerosity must what wehad become. Everyone seemed toagree that thewar was best forgotten. There was agood lifeavailable forthose with talents who were willing were. Thus wecolluded andputtheunimaginable behind us.Although mypazents had been wonderful role models when itcame togenerosity, affection and permissiveness, my success was important tothem. However, my father, especially, would panic whenever Iattempted anything that hedeemed dangerous, which was almost everything. Skating, skiing, riding abike, each inturn was discouraged asbeing likely toinflict instant bodily Itwas inthethings that concerned Iwould agitated, theimages onapast that Ihadshut all happened else. Refugees InThe Land OfPromise Italways seemed unimaginable tomethat any Jewish survivors would choose to remain inEurope, asmany did. Ilearned eventually that notrecommend. wanted any ofthebenefits accruing torefugees. Ifyou came toCanada after the waz, you were considered arefugee. You were often expected tobesatisfied with housing that myparents considered tobethenext best thing toaslum, usually inareas that immigrants had tended tosettle, and still do. Therefore, inmany cities, andthis istrue ofMontreal, there were streets that over the years have provided housing forevery major migration ofpeople who had nomeans. Asthese groups, who are usually hard working and ambitious, accumulate some wealth, they move onand azereplaced bythenext newcomers. My father, without knowing thecity, instinctively knew where hedidn't want tolive. Insome ways my pazents were further impeded byfriends who had arrived inMontreal intheir youth with very limited means, andexpected ustogothrough thesame trials thatthey did. Another issue about being refugees isthat you often found yourself inapazadoxical position. Ifyou chose totake advantage ofwhat organisations that were willing tobeofhelp tothose who needed them, you were often considered -after all,who was there tohelp thepre-war immigrants? Ifontheother hand, like ourfamily, you wanted nothing from anyone and preferred tomake your own way, you were notbehaving within theexpectations ofbeing agreener (the word green was used pejoratively todescribe newcomers); you were putting onairs. This was also true ifyou were ambitious, dressed well (\u00e0laLeon Zworn), didnoteatcanned foods butinsisted onfresh produce prepared with style (\u00e0 laEva Zwom), worked hard and expected your children, orchild, toperform accordingly. Years later, Iwould heaz someone speak ofaboy hehad attended the school with, who had excelled academically, saying `how were wetoknow hewas smart, hewas just thiskidwho came andcould hazdly speak English'. It made sense forsomeone like myself, who worked hard atlosing thetelltale accent, to `forget'. The problem with that type offorgetting isthat you lose big pieces of yourself intheprocess, because it's agame one continues toplay until one isno longer aware how itbegan. My first memory ofMontreal was thetotal whiteness. Wehad snow inGermany but nothing like this glacial city, with itsoutside staircases which were infact as hazardous asthey looked. My parents and Iwere immediately taken shopping for boots and hats, because theMontreal cold istobetaken seriously. Walking, or 68sliding, because one had tolearn how tomanceuvre ontheicysidewalks, along the street was anadventure. Atthesame time, itwas extraordinary toseestores brimming over with fruit and vegetables and andsweets andanumber ofobjects Ididn't know existed. Iremember agirl expected ofgold. Asabsurd asthat may have been, wecertainly didn't expect sidewalks that were made ofice. But theplenitude was overwhelming and I didn't know where tolook first. Istared open mouthed atthis wondrous cornucopia. The older Bella gently prodded mealong before Ibroke myneck looking back. allofthem took usinto their family asifwehadalways belonged there. Looking back, Irealize how little discussion there was ofthewar and ourexperience nothave talked about it-they who had lost everyone near and deaz tothem who had stayed behind. The silence, which was toprotect both them and us,was finally afavour toneither. Two years ago, Ihad dinner with theSchaffer son discovered that hehad researched Obertin onthe internet inaneffort tolearn more about hispazents' which wi[hheld from inthesame way that Ihave kept mystory from mychildren inaspurious effort to spare them ~r more likely myself. My parents rarely saw any ofthepeople wehad known either inthecamps orin Hamburg. We visited one ofthefamilies, only todiscover several months later that the father ofthe family, aman inhis late thirties, had committed suicide. My questions about hisdeath and what would happen tohis young children went unanswered. Shortly after ouramval toMontreal, butwelcomed hehad left. The uncle insisted that wetake aprofessional photo with him, and once more webegan tofeel like exhibits inapanorama that we York and that experience would beamajor inFluence inmylife. The driving force forthe visit was mymother's cousin's husband, Willie, andhow fortunate wewere tohave known him. The two weeks were tobefilled with visits toallofmymother's relatives, including mygrandmother's sister, abeautiful elegant old woman whose children and grandchildren treated her like thequeen she could have been. She grasped mymother's hand theentire evening asifthrough hershe could touch all those others whom shewould never hold again. Here atlast were theteazs and the questions about myaunts and uncles that Ihadbeen anticipating allthistime. Finally, these people wanted toheaz byherfamily, were New York City, Iregretted that mymother could notbewith these people. The visit was extraordinazy intwo other ways. The first were theliving quarters ofmymother's male cousins, notunlike what Ihad previously seen inthemovies. Abarintheliving room that also made milk shakes, aview ofManhattan that overlooked thecity andeveryone dressed asif they were imminently expected atagreat dinner oramarvellous celebration. And yet, these were casual people, hospitable and, again, really happy toseeus~specially my mother whom they hadn't seen since she was ayoung girl -and regretful somuch tome. Fortunately, assumed thetears trying toget usoutofEurope allofthose years. The second important event was meeting mycousins, real relatives that other people hadandInever expected toown aswell. There were two groups; two boys ofmyage andthree orfour that were anywhere between nineteen and intheir twenties. The boys ofmy age were talented singers who had already earned their university tuition performing atbarmitzvahs andweddings. The older cousins totally overwhelmed me. Ofthetwo eldest girls -they were already young women -~ne was married and the other engaged. The married one was studying medicine and theother was atlaw 70school butwas also atalented musician. Myfavourite cousin was Eli,who was stillat university and who, rather than spend New Yeaz's Eve with hisfriends, elected to take along avery starry eyed young cousin [oTimes Square toseeintheNew Year andprovide herwith anadventure that Ifeltconnected, although briefly, how tobeachild butI could beclever, like these cousins. Icould study and someday dosomething important like this new family Ihad discovered. There was atradition that Icould follow, and somehow Ifeltlessalone. Starting Over And somyparents started over, and sodid I.Starting school two years behind myage group, because oflanguage, Iquickly recuperated thenecessary grades. Being very tall formyage was another incentive inrushing head. English came quickly and, for me, ithad tobewithout atrace ofanaccent -not always simple, and the `th' sound was akiller. However, the need tosound like everyone else was anecessary ingredient. Itwas only many years later that Iwould come toappreciate the courtliness ofmyfather's mittel Europa accent. What was difficult was being treated \u00e1SCUl'70Sltlf'.S. JIAS had procured living quarters forusaspaid guests insomeone's home. Housing was impossible even ifone had the means. Key money was thebribe that would eventually procure private accommodations butwewere still along way from there. The rooms that were tobeourfirst home were adequate. Forthefirst time since Iwas two visits thebaba yagas (witches), Iwas too frightened tofallasleep. This particulaz situated inaculdesac, with many children. Encumbered byareluctance tospeak and never having learned toplay children's games, like skipping rope orsomething loudly well. Since wewere toshare, 71along with thesingle bathroom, thekitchen and eating areas, acertain amount of sociability was essential. The three ofuswere appalled that our `hosts', thewoman, herfoster daughter and a tohold who wewere. School was tobeanother adventure. Iwas notthefirst refugee child toattend this neighbourhood school, andthey made every effort toaccommodate me. forme, my predecessors allspoke Yiddish, teachers tried frustration ambition that fortwo weeks. Icarried a small myfather had probably provided aseveryone in thehousehold tired rather quickly communication. Af[er theallotted period, Iactually communicated inareasonable version soon after lostalltraces ofaforeign accent. Ialso abandoned ontheprocess any other language that Ihad spoken before, particulazly asmattering ofPolish and Russian. German remains arather spotty version ofwhat itonce was. However, the need to`fitin',nottobeashamed and nottobelumped indiscriminately with every other refugee, was aprimary need. Isodesperately wanted tobelike everyone else around me, toleave thepast behind and enter this new society asafull-fledged, contributing member. Afriend from and, presumably, what she wanted. Ihadnoclear idea atallofwhat was inside me, what potential Ihad. Iknew what Ididn't want -to bethought ofasunintelligent, mypazents, and, atthis point, they seemed toassume that second lodging was inwhat door. room butitwas bright and theproximity tomy parents was reassuring because Iwas having nightmares. My father would come into myroom when Icried outbutusually Iwould trytostay awake until Iwas thedream wouldn't come back. Our landlords were anelderly couple of whom Iwas slightly afraid. Irazely saw him but thewoman tended towear long layered skirts, ascarf even inthehouse, and hadincredibly long hair sprouting outof herchin. She actually had asomewhat witch like appearance with alongish nose that sheconstantly wiped with theback ofherhand. We ateinourown quarters sothat, once more, itwas my mother who had most ofthedirect dealings with theother family. Iwas almost twelve years oldandbegan toinvite friends over about which the oldwoman would complain tomymother. Iwas pleased when wemoved because I tended tostay outside whenever myparents were away soasnottobealone inthe house. Our third move was insome ways themost satisfactory. The family had ason who was two years older than Iand attended thesame school. Hewas acurious boy who would spend therest ofhislifeinpsychiatric butitwas rather pleasant having someone close tomyage totalk toand with whom toplay cards. Myfather was the persona non grata inthis instance because hewould come home from work without greeting anyone, which these people, probably within reason, found ungracious. He would then proceed toread thepaper orsitimpatiently without saying aword. For some reason, wehad our meals together with them, which only aggravated the situation further. The couple were short and rather portly, butwere quite different from ourprevious landlords inthat they were better educated, more cultured and, best ofall,spoke English beautifully, which was very helpful tomebecause, other than myteachers, Ihad limited contact with people whose speech Ifound worth emulating. Atlong last myparents found avery small one-bedroom apartment, with aliving- dining room and walk inkitchen. My father was pleased with thestreet, mymother liked thefact that ithad been newly redone and freshly painted, and Icould walk to school. We were tolive there forless than two yeazs when myfather found atwo- bedroom apartment aproper kitchen agood toraise mother expressed concern that ifwemoved away too quickly, her friends would perceive itasopportunistic. Myfather, bless him, could nothave home onLaurier was minuscule, itwas allours and thestreet is still lovely tothis day. Infact thebuilding itself, located inanarea that has been rehabilitated bytheFrench-speaking residents, looks better than ever. Ihad skipped thefifth grade andwas looking school that Ibegan tospend serious time with other people and bythetime Istarted Iwas always anadvantage myparents had taught memathematics, Icould write prose in languages other than English and Iwas avoracious reader. Ienjoyed being singled outwhen visitors came totheschool from theschool board and Iloved getting report cards fullofEs(excellent), except forbeing talkative inclass and barely scraping a Good, accompanied byteacher's comments about myneed tomodify mydiscourse during lessons. Unfortunately, Iwas soon tobecome bored, start high school without completing elementary school, andnever having formed anylearning habits, basically tolose myway foralmost four years. Inthemeantime, was torescue mefora number ofyears. The library was atthat time across Mount Royal, the mountain around which thecity was originally constructed, orsoIhave always believed. Every day, after school, Iwould find myway tothis quiet haven andtake mother's friends thought Iwas quite strange, especially inthe summer when Iwould arrive inthe country with thirty library books -special \"country\", Ihated baseball most ofallIhated being picked last because Iwas such abad player. Card games Icould win more. Getting metogooutofthehouse `togetalittle colour' tobeacommunity and one which Iresisted.

Although they would almost always take me along, how Iwished that Itoohadanolder sibling toboss meazound that wehadacarof ourown and that mymother would find herself more sophisticated friends who did something other than play cards. Inthis last, myfather and Iconcun ed.And then I would feel guilty because Ireally loved myparents and recognised that Ideclare with pride that I'm from Montreal. Itisunusual forany astowhether years the non-answer. Truth is,thepost-war person that Iwas tobecome was and remains a Montrealer. The city was myhaven; itoffered safety that Ididn't realise that Iwas lacking. Montreal may have even atthat time been perceived astheFrench-speaking capital ofthenew world andtheParis ofNorth America, butformymother itwas a place that sold real bread, which istosay European. However, the old world similarities were meaningless tome.This was anew world which Icould explore and Inever remember theneed tocompare ittowhat came before; that was temporary, and receded further into thepast with each new discovery. The city had wonderful outdoor staircases that, foralocation that was covered iniceand snow forthebetter part oftheyear, were themost impractical bitofarchitecture imaginable. even those contributed tothesense ofagora, avisible community carrying onthetask of living. The smells were new: smoked meat and French fries permeated theairasone 75passed Ben's orsome other emporium ofdelectable on totaste itasareward, thelocal beer thatIwas toretire forthwith. Montreal gave afalse impression ofcongruence. The city was divided into what has been called the\"two solitudes\", theEnglish and theFrench. However, this was only thebeginning. The school system was further separated along religious lines, Catholic and Protestant, thelatter comprising everyone else including usJews. The English community atthetime was abroad entity, themore established having Scottish roots and having little todowith themajority ofthe Jewish community. Nevertheless, because oflinguistic preference, italso served loosely asacatchall ofsorts for immigrants and other less than prosperous inhabitants. The English lived onthe western part oftheisland that was Montreal, many itwas tobecome. The post-war immigrants, among others, could befound largely inthemiddle and [oward theeast. This area had alife, energy and rituals allofitsown, and many were connected to Jewish holidays. One oftheexperiences that Ihave missed themost thenecessary challahs (braided egg bread) and other foods before closing time. The elementary schools that Iwas toattend almost exclusively served Jewish students. My sense ofitisthat the larger number ofchildren ofJewish immigrant families attended theprivate parochial schools, which, nodoubt, excused tuition at least inpart forthenewcomers. My father insisted onthepublic school system. The only explanation hegave was theusual -Iwould have areduced curriculum todeal with andtherefore less pressure. My mother didn't challenge this decision. Inlater years, when my own children were tobegin their education inthese very same religious schools from which Ihad been excluded, heronly additional clarification 76was that perhaps meeven further from thepast and other children with similar wartime experience. Mymother was also atthetime very much influenced byherlandslite allofwhom sent children inamiddle class cookie cutter environment. Myparents were still constructing their lives and had few preconceived notions astohow Ishould organise mine. The schools Iwent tohad enough students like myself; young people with wishes toaccomplish something worthwhile. Ifelt free. Another important element that was todifferentiate theCanadian experience was that there was no`melting pot' mentality guiding our[ransition into any given direction. We were notPolish Jews orGerman Jews orRussian Jews. We were Jews who had made thechoice tospeak English and thus aligned ourselves with one part ofthe population. Other than that wewere free toconstruct, orreconstruct, ourlives. There were constraints that Ididn't understand asachild. Happily, noone attempted to point them outtome. Montreal provided theroots that Ilonged forand which, pazadoxically, Iwas never to offer myown children. These roots connected metomy adopted community and helped metounderstand, ifnotnecessarily who Iwas, atleast how Iwanted tobe. But more than that, they afforded meahistory that was notabout death and survival. Although theMontreal English-speaking community has decreased because ofthe toknow' basis. They accumulated certain information and assumed the rest, until the assumption that they held proved tobeincorrect. Ihave noidea why they were never 77informed about health insurance, because life insurance salesmen appeared atour door before weeven had one toclose. However, inevitably one ofuswas going to require hospitalisation was doomed tofailure and my appendix was eventually removed just before itburst. Since my parents had no medical coverage, thisintervention was touseupapart ofthemoney that theyeaz tobecome illagain and this time my mother sought amedical diagnosis before prescribing distraction. My very young body had been deprived ofanumber ofnecessities when wewere inhiding and it needed help tofunc[ion. However, whcever was treating mybody could nottake account that mysense ofaccountability about what Ihad wrought onmy hard working parents would hurt more than themany sutures that would eventually beremoved. This early experience may have gone farincreating alifelong concern fortheneed ofnational healthcare. What sense notonly had Isingle handily wiped outmyparents savings but Ihadshamed them inthepride that they hadofalways being there when inthesame year foremergency My parents, without hospital insurance, insisted that Ihave aprivate doctor, which ateupalarge part oftheir that was proving they wanted looking through and of theother children attempted tomake ituptomebysitting with meand bringing me butIwould matters that were theprovince ofinen. My father could have inspired and ignited the feminist movement allbyhimself. Hetook metothe movies, the theatre and occasional concerts, Hewas vehemently opposed tomy going touniversity. Irealised asIdidthen that hefeared that further studies would make mepotentially more independent andeventually take meaway from him. Which itdid. Years later, when hewas very illand living with usinBrussels, medication would often bring about mood changes. Hemight bealternatively violent, disoriented, depressed orallthree. Iwas constantly working with hisphysicians and talking with colleagues and friends about how toadjust thedrugs hetook inorder to make him more comfortable. Yet each time hewas offered anew prescription he would explain very reasonably [othedoctor, who was there asapersonal favour to me, that hecouldn't possibly take anew pillwithout first discussing itwith hisson-in- law. Myhusband took this, along with some ofmyfather's other foibles, with good humour and affection, although Isuspect that attimes itemban assed him onmy behalf. My mother structured alifeforherself that she was not tochange formore than twenty years. Each Saturday she played cards with thelandslite. The locale would alternate each week and followed asimilar pattern. Cards followed byavery late meal ofpotatces, herring andother such indigestible faze. My father and Iwondered how mother sheserved. My father would accompany herbutusually leave after thegame was well underway. Hewould ask herfrom time totime togotothemovies instead butshewould never give upherSaturday night ritual. The formewas when they played atourhouse Since Islept onthehide-away bed intheliving room, Iwould room until everyone left.

The message that was cleazly conveyed was that university was less about leazning and more about future work. Ivisited hospitals to understand what physio- and occupational therapists did aswell other professions allied tomedicine. With very few Jewish students admitted tomedical school under a rigid quota, thenotion ofinedical school was noteven apassing thought. Also, my undergraduate grades would nothave made that possible. Istarted university atage 17,four and ahalf years after coming toCanada, found two yeazs at university aconfusing combination ofinstruction from myparents and anatural curiosity ofwanting tolearn. And soIinterviewed personnel directors who were surprised toseeahigh school student who was planning toattend university discuss afuture care,er. Since Ihadclearer ideas about that Ididn't want todointhefuture, Ifound myself grasping atstraws. young inyears, itseems tomenow that Iwas altematively excessively worried and ambivalent about myfuture. Which was curious, because I never believed that there was afuture. Although Iwould lieinbed atage eleven worrying about what was then Red China invading Canada and theUnited States: even aschildren, weCanadians have always understood that wemight stand and fall with our powerful neighbour ofwhose policies wedidn't necessarily approve. I wasn't altogether convinced that there would beatomorrow. Perhaps themost serious issue that thewar had leftmewith and in fact Ibehaved deep inside meInever believed it.When Ihad children Iwas often preoccupied with thoughts about how I would save them ifthehorrors ofthelast waz should befall us.How Iwould keep them alive. How Iwould keep them well. Ialways feltthat they hadbeen entrusted to measapromise ofthefuture, toprotect Idesperately wanted them theperspective ofthepresent, I realize that over theyears Icould have explained more. Because inwithholding my story, itwas inevitable that Iwould also withhold parts ofmyself. Looking which, even describing. MyMother's Illness My mother died inher eazly sixties after fifteen yeazs ofillness and eventual paralysis. She was thefirst person inher tobeburied inagrave. While everyone spoke ofherpremature death, Imarvelled atthefact that Icould visit her, bring flowers and mourn herintheway most people areaccustomed togrieve for their dead. Butwenever had. Italways amazed me that, although she accepted her illness asbeing almost inevitable, aform ofpenalty ofuswould have preferred death. Ithink that had a great deal todowith her grandchildren, the prize that Hitler couldn't seize. My mother was agrandmother atforty-eight and proud ofit.Where she always had energy and spunk, theactofrelinquishing herself totheillness appeared tobeoutof chazacter unless one can that each ofushas aboundary, alimit beyond which wecannot urge ourselves. My mother may have feltthat shehad done enough. Sadly, Inever made any attempt toask her about this and other things, although she may have been ready tospeak ofit.My only excuse isthat Iwas a neophyte therapist, very careful nottointrude. The other, perhaps more accurate, reason isthat my mother was unpredictable and attimes very punishing inher reactions. And there were times that sheresented me, and especially my father on whom shewas totally dependent. Some occasions when, even with limited speech, shewould tellmethat sheneeded amother [odepend onmybrain because years later that Idiscovered that Ihad been pretty. She was gentler with my children than shehad been with meand gloried ineverything they did. Giving her grandchildren was probably mysingular gifttoher. And they were fortunate tohave her, even forthefew years that she was well. My middle sontells ofhow when he was little and mymother was nolonger heasked that myfather would notsurvive mymother's illness. She would call him constantly, without regard astowhether hewas eating, working oreven onoccasion trying torest. Although weekdays, she toclose hisbusiness and come home. Allourattempts toexplain tothem that was untenable felloninattentive years, myfather refused soon recover. they both colluded intheir interdependence, and shut me, andeveryone else, out. I've often felt great remorse that Ihadnotdone was incharge during hersickness, and that hedidnotaccept interventions in any form. However, being the proficient nurturer ofguilt that Iam, there aze numerous incidents that Icanrecall, during asleepless night, when Icould have been there more Ialways thought ofmymother astypifying acertain survivor they tried togothrough themotions ofbeing andfeeling. The only exceptions were her grandchildren. Ialways understood that myfather and Iwere poor substitutes forwhat she had lost. She tried but itwas asifallofthereally important things had already happened. When shelearned ofCousin Willie's death, a man shegenuinely cared for, shecasually invited friends toplay cards, because they had planned toplay cards that Friday evening. When hergreat friend, Abie Schaffer 82died, she was moved but there were few tears, and there were rarely any forother people who had been herfriends oracquaintances. would emotions that mymother's grief overwhelmed herability tomourn. There was simply too much. She rarely spoke ofhersisters, unless shewas telling astory. And the stories themselves intheir humour permitted her not togive recognition toher Wespoke orherfears asIhave already normal. Inever questioned forallofthereasons that Ihave cited but most important, because lost theability toarticulate that which hurt. Orperhaps wehadnever been hervery was only forty-nine years oldwhen myeldest son was born and would tobecalled less tosome close who didnotatfirst realize this was theJewish word forgrandfather. When mymother was tooillto travel with friends, webegan tospend summer holidays together. My father would rent ahouse inCape Cod andwewould pileinto two cars and drive from Montreal. In thedays before carairconditioners andwith two andthen three little boys, what could have been atrying journey was often relieved bymymother's thecontentment was away oflifeformyparents -this was definitely notanarmy that ever travelled anywhere onanempty stomach. The arrangement suited allofus:My 83children had their grandparents, had andIhadamodicum offreedom. Forboth myfather and mymother their grandchildren were their reward forsurvival; proof that Hitler didn't succeed. Even after we moved toEurope, my parents, amazingly mymother travelled toBrussels fortwo ofoursons' Bar Mitzvahs. Totally paralysed, she would bethere forthe service but not fordinner. How little I appreciated their effort, especially hers, tobethere formy children. Although I wanted, needed, tohave them there, Idon't think that Iever told them, especially her, that any ofusever said, how much itmeant that she came. Iwas very efficient in providing nursing care andother wonderful house. Ihad solittle understanding, until Imyself became ill,how hard itistofocus outwardly when you're inpain, how long term chronic illness serves todisconnect you from theworld ofthehealthy.

What truly infuriated meabout my father was histendency torewrite history. Although Iwas very young during andimmediately topossess avery retentive memory. Because somuch unusual, and because learning, retained entire sequences father recollections years before and had reviewed them intheoccasional discussions with mymother, Iresented histampering. Sothis often for, allpurported authority, adeference Ididn't think had been there before. Doctors, among others, were prestigious figures hedidn't question, and when hebecame illsometime him one Sunday -itwas early morning forhim -to that hefeltunwell. While what hesaw day, told that heprobably needed butthat there was following week, having scheduled allofthenecessary tests bytelephone and having arranged forhim toseetheessential medical specialists, hewent along quite happily, still making excuses forthefailure ofhismaven (expert) toprovide theneeded care. But person that had been myfather hadgradually disappeared long before that. How dces one gracefully manage thegradual shift inrelations between parent that hehad made before and even being angry attimes that wehadn't left Europe before thewar started. Primarily though Iwas angered byhistendency touseme, myexistence, told mymother; shehad reported that remark to me when she told meofher abortion.

When Ipointed outtohim that there were periods inboth our lives when noone knew what decisions tomake, hisanswer triggered myever-present guilt response that somehow suggested that Iwas blaming him forthewar initsentirety. Our differences were allpost-war -hisfear forme and forassumed authority, and mypetulant argument that Itook noinstruction from that authority. What was worse was that Icouldn't defend myself against hisfears. This would normally beacommon disagreement between aparent and anadult child, ifthemeaning where notsoloaded with personal history.

Sigie's boys, now men intheir sixties, have been impressively successful asphysicians, attorneys and businessmen. One ofthe interesting bits ofinformation that Ihave gleaned from hisstories and that ofhis `boys' isthat this population ofyoung people held two diverse beliefs: there were those who accepted thefact that their families had been killed, that they would not magically emerge from themass ofsurvivors.

The Meaning ofthePast Writing this personal narrative, deconstructing alife Ihave finally chosen tothink about, speak about and write about isone themost difficult things that Ihave ever attempted. Connecting this history totheinfluence ithashad onmyprofessional life has made mevery aware that meaning fluctuates and that neither life nor therapy occur inavacuum. Although Ihave been authentic inmyrelationships with clients, I have come torealize inwriting this that that Ioften refer Irealized.

But notalways, and notwith everyone. Deconstructing one's past is useful butnotforsissies. 105Inthe next chapter Iwill look back onacareer and choices that were certainly influenced bythemeanings that Ihave, had, and assigned towhat came before. Two major influences that came from thepast have been arespect forpeople, anawareness that meaning emerges from thejoint activities ofpeople interacting with oneanother and that therapists are partners facilitating, not arbiters.

However, ifIwere satisfied with own self-examination atthat time, my transparency, ifyou like, Iprobably would beexamining theconnection between thelifeIhadlived time myprofessional actions. Looking back Irealize that \"live\" supervision isagood teaching and learning skill. The difficulty is insynthesizing one's personal learning -thewhy how dowe, experiences, Irealize that whatever have included other people. There areadisproportionate number of holocaust survivors like myself, who have chosen psychotherapy, medicine or psychoanalysis asalife's work. In\"Lost Childhood and theLanguage ofExile\" (Szekacs-Weisz and Ward, 2004) more than twenty analysts and therapists telltheir stories. Anumber ofthem have published books, including Hoffman (2004), Eros (1996), Pick (2001), Wilson (2003.). Jane Marks isonly one oftheprofessional writers who interviewed hidden children who were professional therapists. (Marks, 1993) Asapsychotherapist mypersonal and professional goal was toengage clients or patients into aconversation and relationship, with theresult that they would gain the knowledge, strength and information tomanage their own lives, tomaster their own destinies. IfIhadleamed itwas - need thetools tosave themselves. How dopeople plan their futures and when dothey start? Where dothese aspirations come from? And what about the child who was charged torepresent atown, a community that \"was\" -what areherchoices? My endeavor. Ivisualized that was \"hands on.\" The profession that Ieventually chose, projected meinto thevery questions that I began asking atavery young age. These queries had todowith how people learned, and how they managed themselves inthis world, what they needed tofeel safe and how those ofuswho hadaccess toinformation -through quirks - could become resources toothers. Itseemed tomethat informing would give longer term results than only `helping'. (Informing involves theclient inanexchange of receiving andproviding information, and aongoing dialogue astheinformation shifts andchanges over time. )The next step was toleam byentering into aconversation, to become aparticipant. This required exploring thesource ofothers' deliberations and thecontexts inwhich they developed. The fact that these preoccupations occurred atavery young age isnotsurprising if you consider what Ihad already lived through, thechanges that asachild who had 108survived Hitler's war, Ihadassimilated before theageofnine.

Weonly told ourcolleagues what wereally thought. Questions from parents who dared toask whether we, ourselves, had children orother queries ofapersonal nature, were perceived asaggressive oracting out. Disagreements were termed asresistance and interpreted assuch. Surely wewere alleither well enough trained orcompetent enough todivert questions that were too personal without making wholesale judgments about thenegative motivation ofour clients -even attimes when the language ofthequeries was intrusive. What wemissed was that part oftheprocess of how `they' (our clients) were attempting toconstruct arelationship with each other and with us.We\"looked on\" rather to\"bein.\" asanuntrained, but well supervised, member ofstaff intwo psychiatric hospitals.

However, this work resulted inmyreceiving numerous phone calls from those who Ihad interviewed indicating that they wanted tocome back learned -even inCanada -there ingrowing old. Geriatric care was hardly aconsideration inthesixties and, like many young mental health workers, Imoved ontoanendeavor that notonly interested mebuthadmore todowith testing creativity than taking care ofpeople.

Both were extraordinary opportunities forsomeone towork with groups and families and note first hand the courage with which people canmanage adversity. (Since Ihave right and possibly into shrubbery orworse. I'd like tothink that Ifostered able thetime space myformal which Iwas finally toattend was 110onclient centered counseling andtheprime theorists studied were Carl Rogers (1986) and Fritz Perls (1973). There was anintroduction tothe history ofpsychiatry including Freud and Jung. Some courses were offered on the neo-Freudians, particularly Karen Horney (1991), aswell asthedominant thinkers inpsychology at the time -Heinz (1939), Abraham Mazlow (1987), Eric Erickson (1950,1963), some ofB.F.Skinner (1971) and Irving Yalom (1995) forgroups. My primary interest was supervised psychotherapy (including play therapy), theuse of testing aspart oftherapy (Stanford was notconsidered ahigh priority and what onelearned about family therapy was through conferences andworkshops. These were theyears ofVietnam. Classes were three children, acouple forwhom going toschool was an expensive luxury and theneed tograduate and start working apriority. The `group' psychology professors taught many oftheir courses away from thecampus. Itook so many oftheir courses that Iwas invited toenter thedoctoral program and toteach a course section. The client centered approach had some appeal tomebecause ofitsnon-directive methodology, unique intheUSatthetime. Imust saythat Iwas caught between the more intellectual work going oninthefield and didn't fully appreciate Rogerian Therapy. until Ihad the experience touse itcorrectly. When Iparticipated ina workshop with Rogers, Ikept coming back tothefact that although Ifound histotal acceptance ofwhat was said seductive, Icouldn't imagine how itwould flow ina conversation with seriously delusional patients. Many years later, when Iworked with awoman who hasbeen diagnosed asschizophrenic and who limited heranswers to abstract images, inamoment ofdesperation Isimply followed her logic and went where ittook us,only asking questions forclarification and meaning. Isometimes think that was themoment that Ibecame arather worthy therapist. Nevertheless, I found Rogers himself asomewhat distant individual -which may bealso beexactly what worked with my`schizophrenic' lady. 111Douglas Arbuckle, my primary adviser (1970) was aclient centered therapist, influenced byhismentor Carl Rogers. Heliked mywork andbasically encouraged me todowhat interested was eventually theprocess ofattempting theundoing ofthelegacy of aculture ofindividualism that had blocked the relational dimension inidentity formation (Shotter, ).Psychology remains many things tomany people. areresearchers shrug atthestruggles ofthose ofuswho toface different purpose. Psychoanalytic colleagues donot hesitate tocomment that individuals must take into account their personal, inter- psychic history. Ihave personally found thework ofresearch psychologists very helpful inattempting tobetter understand events orexperiences inalarger context. Nevertheless, some importance oftherelational dimension has facilitated theprocess inuniversities and hospitals -also aspart ofabroader training. We can more comfortably focus away from thehistorical preoccupation with theindividual, thecenter ofthespokes ina wheel, sotospeak, and take into consideration theperson, spokes and the focus onhow the wheels regulate themselves toattain stability onachanging terrain. The changes inhow weunderstand human behavior revitalized psychology. These changes have created the space both for narrative and autobiography asviable methods forstudying human interaction. Autobiographies, from thisview, areviewed asless about individuals and more about aneraand allthose who were affected ina complex process. OnBecoming lives asindividuals, itisnotsurprising that my first pre graduate school full time employment was ahousing project where one could find every form offamily -one 112parent homes, children being raised bygrandparents, amother living onone floor with anew partner while her children lived one level below with another care provider. The project was near theChicago steel mills and the mostly Mexican residents had refused toallow theintegration ofsixblack families, thus creating the second worst racial riot inthat city, acity that was notimmune toclashes among the different races. Iquickly found for myself asupervisor and was introduced to system's thinking many years before thetheory was tolaunch anew paradigm in family andcouples therapy. The benefit ofseeing afamily together began fortuitously. Icouldn't make sense of their separate stories which necessitated bringing them together inone place, oron one stoop. Lacking any expertise inwhat this goal, necessity theprocess children. Enlightenment came years later intheperson ofNathan Ackerman (1966), one of thefather's offamily therapy. Ananalyst, Iremember him asalarge bearded man of great stature, although inreality hewas quite small and hisstature was inwhat he brought with him into atherapeutic exchange. The place was theAlan Memorial Hospital atMcGill University and theaudience was seated inaseminar room when Ackerman welcomed thefamily onto theplatform. Hebegan thesession with afew questions hewas Jewish. Iwas thunderstruck. Inthis bastion Iwas somewhat Iwondered how one arelationship inthepresence silent astheGreek Chorus, (Papp, 1974) and, like other teachers offamily therapy, Ileamed over time how toinvolve students who, inmy time, satbehind aone way mirror. Iwould include them indiscussions with the them present another perspective tothesession. However, Inever leamed tofeel truly comfortable with their presence behind themirror. Videotaping, another teaching tool which was introduced andregulazly accompanied most sessions inclinics andteaching centers, came onthescene well after 1967 when Iobserved my first family therapy session. The tapes were notonly useful forsupervision butoften revealed nuances that were missed inthesession. When family therapy came into its prime afew years later, weworked infront oflazge audiences with 'liv\u00e9 families and theinterview would befollowed byadiscussion, first with asmall group selected from theaudience andfollowed byquestions from other spectators. Many of thefamilies appeazed not tomind this spectacle forwhich they volunteered, and thought that there was abenefit from allofthis expertise. And there very well may have been. Certainly wealllearned from each other. However, Ialways missed the intimacy oftheprivate conversation -and, attimes, provocation. The session, aswell inChicago, made meawaze ofrace and variations ofcolor, and other \"visible\" hidden children who lived their lives in secret. Itwas Dr.Emesse Brody, formally Chairman ofAfrican American Studies at Wesleyan University, who brought this more forcefully tomy attention. Her own white grandfather andblack grandmother have produced descendants who areeither black orareblue eyed blonds. For some themix was notsoclear.

Identity formation isnot simple forthose among uswho think that they know who they are-butwhat about therest? Years later, inmywork with organizations, thediversified work force caused great concern, particularly tothenewly combined companies, theresult ofbuyouts and mergers. The primary focus was ondiffering nationalities, and, inAmerica, gender and race. Companies such asDaimler Chrysler inGermany rushed their senior 114executives into English classes, while Europeans were bowing and exchanging bilingual business cards, extended with both hands, tonew Japanese partners. The business world was attempting torush headlong into creating some homogeneity, while thefamilies who were being relocated aspart ofthis exchange were trying to hold on,particulazly fortheir children, tosome connection ofwho they were and what was now expected ofthem. Some ofthese families would eventually participate insome ofour family therapy extravaganzas oflater years, since we, inEurope, were constantly importing American therapists and many ofthese families had thegood fortune -forusand I hope forthem -ofspeaking English. Those were the years when Donald Jackson (1957) ,Cazl Whittaker (1982), Nathan Ackerman (1966) and Murray Bowen (1978) first sattogether, oneach side ofamirror, and putfamily observed behind theone way mirror. What adiscussion this must have been: Ackerman, with hispsychoanalytic training hasbeen described asusing apsychodynamic approach, Murray Bowen emphasized insight and family interactions, and Whittaker didhisown somewhat abrasive directive and, atthesame time compassionate, interventions. There were those masters inthefield who elicited affect, although notasanend in itself.

And themathematical tools herefers todidbecome available. was this andthetheory ofchaos, that embodied from quantitative toqualitative, and ontopatterns. The latter had enonmous importance totherapists like myself who, rather than dig into the past for understanding, looked atthepast aswell asthe present inorder todiscem -to that held those who consulted usintheir grasp. Whatever their basis, whatever their origin, themeaning that they gave totheir actions and therepetition oftheir rituals patterns ofbehavior andassigning new meaning toactions became the driving force ofthe new systems based psychotherapy. Consultations were directive, but didbring about changes inself damaging behavior relatively quickly, which was more effective than what wehad achieved with themore intellectual psychoanalytic methods. Iapproached cautiously. WW2, which had asingular meaning inmylife, had liberated psychiatry. The need tosend shell shocked soldiers back tothefront may have been anearly death knoll that reduced theimportance ofpsychoanalysis. The availability of awhole range ofpsychotropic drugs was reawakening apopulation ofchronic patients who had, sometimes indiscriminately, filled the wards ofpsychiatric facilities, many ofthese facilities not allthat different from theoldstyle asylums. Group therapy had achieved wide acceptance. All ofthese were precursors in America ofthe 1960s Mental Health Act, that was characterized bypictures of hospital administrators proudly standing onthegrounds oftheir hospitals, surrounded bytheempty beds that had previously housed mental patients (many ofwhom were 116notnecessarily classical `mental patients' buttheretazded and those suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's who had been part ofthepatient mix.) (Italy was tofollow inthe 1980s when they also established revised rules forhospitalization.) Although many ofthese changes were ofuswho worked inthemore traditional and respected settings where psychoanalysis still reigned, allofthetransformations around uswere somehow kept separate from the guiding theory. Myeazlier reading insystems began with Ludwig von Bertalanffy (1950), anAustrian biologist and member oftheVienna Circle (group ofinternational philosophers and scientists)v whose concepts ofopen systems (open because they needed tofeed ona continual flux ofmatter and energy from their environment inorder tostay alive) and general systems theory helped toestablish intheeazly 1930s systems thinking asa major scientific movement. His goal was inpart toreplace the mechanistic foundations that were theunderpinning ofscience with oforganized wholes. His was self-regulating theprinciples mechanism defined asfeedback, which became acentral concept ofcybernetics. From the work ofthe interdisciplinary thinkers who convened inNYC forthe Macy Conferences, emerged ground breaking ideas that included anunderstanding that the pattern ofself-organization (thefact that living systems self-organizing -was identified as being thekey tofeedback. Human systems were further defined as`purposeful' due to self-regulation through feedback which istheessential mechanism ofhomeostasis, living organism's ability tomaintain itself inastate ofdynamic balance. 117Tosummarize briefly, what was relevant totherapy was that systems were self- regulating, self-organizing, and connected through aseries ofpattems that could functioned asfeedback loops. The resulting therapeutic work further recognized the system's tendency towazds itshomeostatic statevi. This suggested that thenotion of `resistance' was thesystem's way ofmaintaining itself and therefore introducing change into asystem had toaccount forthat tendency. This theoretical framework would fields. Anthropologist, theoretician, one ofBateson's best known works -\"Steps toAn Ecology forthepractitioner some idea orentity that sheorhehasbeen struggling tounderstand. Moving gingerly psychodynamic explanations toasystems and connected view oftheworld, itwas Bateson who metaphorically held my hand and ledmeinto the promised land of clearer understanding. Among his many contributions was the notion that \"information isnews of difference.\" Also, his work onthe theory ofthe double bind, often attributed exclusively toDonald Jackson (1957), aPalo Alto psychiatrist and himself amajor figure inthefield, was significant. Jackson's contributions The term \"context markers\", who died tooyoung toenergize thefield inaway that hiscolleagues who lived longer who first coined thephrase \"the map isnottheterritory\", anoft axiom that was webegan torealize that themap was, in fact, theterritory, was also acentral figure atthis time. Belgian biologist and Nobel 118Prize winner Ilya Prigogine's (1984) work was brought into thefield byMony Elkaim 1997), himself anAmerican trained Belgian psychiatrist. Although theMental Research Institute, inPalo Alto, influenced many future family therapists and researchers, particularly thebooks ofPaul Watzlawick (1967,1974). The approach with the yeazs were the structuralists -Minuchin, was interesting one tomanipulate thesystem, through suggestions and tasks aswell asthrough physically moving individual members -for instance, mothers and sons who appeared enmeshed (aMinuchin term designating anover- involved relationship that was aconstraint oftheson) would beasked tochange chairs orsitnear someone inthefamily who they might more appropriately bond with. This is, of course, an oversimplification. The tasks that they assigned would also help tomobilize therigid system away from the symptom and into more beneficial relationships. Itseems simplistic and indeed itwas very manipulative. Itserved upatemporazy step \"first order change\", which isto saythat specific behaviors that were targeted would bemodified, often very quickly, buttheintervention would address itself tothesymptom, rather than attempting to deal with what may bethereal problem inthesystem.

A small, dark, intense man, hismay betheonly name recalled bypsychiatric residents who aremore biological than psychotherapeutic intheir work with patients.

The Milan Centro DeFamiglia The Americans were doing innovated work and we, inEurope, pa\u00edd attention. Two of those taking notice were Italians Gianfranco Cecchin and Luigi Boscolo. Graduates of Padua University Medical School, they had gone toNew York tostudy psychiatry, where they went tohear apresentation ofafellow Milan psychiatrist called Mara Selvini Pallazoli, ananalyst whose early work with families was atfirst tobemore eagerly accepted inthe US than inItalian academic difficulty attention and ltalian government because ofher grasp ofhow systems functioned.) Along with psychiatrist Juliana Prata, thefour became themost influential writers, teachers and therapists inthefield. However, they also first called inPaul Watzlawick, ofthePalo Alto Mental Research Institute, inthefield ofcommunication and theoriginal home written about Selvini, Prata, Boscolo and Cecchin. Their seminal publication was \"Paradox Counter Paradox\" (1978) which served asabible foranentire References arestill frequently made to\"the post Milan period\", particularly where the work ofnarrative and constructionism areconcerned. Many ofushave been intheir debt because they influenced our work aswell asthe direction itwould eventually take. Before describing the work ofthe Milan group and their global influence, itis necessary tomake adistinction between self learning and institutional learning, both ofwhich require adifferent change process. For me, adapting to,and being adopted by,theMilan people, was anintellectual reawakening. Their work required creativity aswell ascuriosity and notallofthis was worked out with thefamily. 120approach ofpsychoanalysis which was the\"religion\" andperhaps thequickest, tobetaken seriously as atherapist. That's how you won your stripes. Group and family therapy were two ways ofdiversifying work with individuals which allowed one todeal with abroader context oftheir lives. Asystemic approach, which Ifirst eventually was topresent two limitations: thecontext was toonarrow since they always dealt only with thefamily. The second problem, that has since been remedied, was adistance, anintellectual presence that lacked empathy. Since myown identity was ontheproposition that welive ourlives inrelationships, From aninstitutional perspective, theprocess was more complica[ed. Our students, psychiatrists and psychologists who were fulfilling academic requirements, also included older, more experienced professionals who were attempting toexpand their practices. They came into aprogram that was informed byastructural family therapy approach that had been introduced bymypredecessors and were intheprocess of struggling with how this fitwith their earlier training. Excited bythepossibilities, I attempted toconvert one and alltomynew religion, while Iwas still intheprocess thecatecism. Milan insisted onateam approach, fortherapists aswell assupervisors. The fact that they spoke Italian and English, while mypeople spoke French and Flemish became thelesser ofourproblems. Itwas new notonly anew way ofinterviewing anddiscussing issues and familiarizing oneself with aentire new literature that was more Wittgenstein than Satir, it necessitated adifferent what tocreate. My major error was thenature ofinvolving others. One can state one's intentions, explain thereasons and offer leadership while encouraging conversation. One can build people's organizations inthefuture, myown brief experience with managing alearning system became infinitely helpful. While Iwas inthemidst of simultaneous discovery, integration and teaching, Iwish Iknew then what Iknow now. The Milan many including onanorexia and bulimia, circulaz questions (hypothesis, circularity and neutrality), and much that have been integrated into thework ofmany ofus,including Peggy Penn (1985), Lynn Hoffman (1981), Karl Tomm (1985, 1987a, 1987b, 1987c), Helm Sterlin and the Heidelberg Group, and Tom Andersen (1992among many others. The 'piece deresistance' formany was the issues inthe family that maintained itsrigidity. The prescription would be delivered with great aplomb by the therapist, ofren accompanied bytasks tobeperformed bydifferent members ofthefamily. Inthe early years the prescription bebased onaparadoxical injunction which hopefully would lead thefamily toattempt another form ofbehavior. This involved assigning adifferent meaning totheactions that the family was taking that were perpetuating thesymptom. Ifinfact they wished topreserve themeaning, they hadto consider altering The Milan group toseparate inthelate seventies, with Boscolo Cecchin continuing theCenter while Selvini and Prata, joined bySelvini's son, would continue their work separately. Selvini's best known work inthose years was possibly the Universal Prescription (1988) ,afeedback tothefamily, designed tobring about change, which would have general applicability toallsystems and allsituations. It never quite caught on. Selvini spoke French and Iinvited hertowork with mydepartment whom always 122respect and value, more offamily therapy leaders from many European countries, including England, Wales, France, Holland andBelgium. (This was in1975 and theselection ofthegroup was also dependent on everyone speaking English. This group met fortwo years. Itwas ashift from amore psychodynamic toa hypothetical position. Interpretations were replaced bythetherapists, aswell asthe observing team, developing and testing hypotheses. This gave greater latitude tothe family toexplore their own opinion than trying tomake sense orfind afitforwhat the therapist suggested was operative. This approach also gave therapists better opportunities toexplore secrets -i.e.\"Should ithappen that thefamily secret who leas[?\" The unique use ofthequestions that theMilan group had developed (1980) made a circular, orreflexive, rather than alineaz form ofconceptualizing years, theMilan worked with schizophrenia inavery specific manner. They would seethefamily monthly, inpart because anumber ofthefamilies traveled considerable distances toreach them. Although designed asaresearch study, theresults were never formally published, only referred toinvery general terms. It appears that thefamilies, unable tosustain themonth long wait, and having noother support systems such asthose that exist inAmerica, would consult other mental health professionals intheinterim. Being either temporarily inspired bythis method ordespairing inthe difficulty ofworking with some families, Iattempted this approach -with thesame results. When their fame had reached many countries around theworld, Boscolo and Cecchin held summer conferences forforeigners and, one year, invited agroup ofustoteach 123along with them -Lynn Hoffman, Peggy Caille, myself, among Iattempted experienced child and themultiple groups ofprofessionals that thefamily dealt with regularly when refen-ed forhelp. The role play was notmymost accomplished presentation (Icould also tellbecause mycolleagues were soloving, unchallenging and supportive afterwards) but itdealt with something other than families -the larger systems which have now been integrated into many training programs. My real sinwas indeviating from what Ihad learned from Boscolo and Cecchin todiscover when everyone showed tapes ofinterviews didnotwish topartake inanumber ofactivities that were made available, they would watch instead tapes offamilies and the final prescription.) Inour first open disagreement, Cecchin accused, \"why that was soJayHaley\". This was atruer comunication, 1986) I,onmypart, told Boscolo -hewas easier to argue with -thatthey were perpetuating only part ofwhat they offered -who could be asgood asthem indesigning prescriptions. Eventually someone would be,and even their greatest admirers would need toexpand their own learning. This eventually was tohappen when was toinvite Humberto Maturana and toCalgary, two Chilean biologists who introduced many ofthe ideas that shifted family therapy and systemic thinking into arevised consideration. Boscolo and Cecchin were always prepazed toatleast listen tonew ideas. andVernon thelives who couples, hehad become interested inconstructionist theory, had authored achapter (1992) and was planning toparticipate abook. Hewas killed three second part ofthe interview. Hehad become interested innon family systems andjoked about how he was supervising asubject which heknew solittle about -buthewas having funand I don't doubt thatthose who consulted him were learning. Atroubled man, Cecchin was 124oneofthemost brilliant people inthefield and was himself always open tolearning. Hewas alonely man who had many friends. Inthebeginning, systems theory and Milan were, forme, part ofthesame story. Ihad read thework oftheearly cybemeticists, most specifically Norbert (1954) and von Bertalanffy (1950). The structuralists andVirginia Satir have also been described as'systemists' but their approaches lacked the circularity and the self organizing aspect ofsystems thinking, and their interviews were notdesigned toenhance the reflexivity ofthesystem, something that circular questions achieved soreadily The work with systems underwent itsfirst major shift with theintroduction ofthe2nd Cybernetic. This challenged themore mechanical aspect ofthe]stcybemetic driven. bepart ofit(von Fcerster, 1970). Reality was co-created and there were multiple realities with equal authority. The question ofintentions was puttorest, replaced bythefact that things happen. Asatherapist who never believed inwhat was gained byassigning blame and had herself experienced many varied realities, this theoretical shift fitwell with what Iwas already doing. REFLECTION: Theory ofPractice, Theory ofThought Ithasbeen said bypersonal experience. Idon't necessarily agree witthis dictum. Certainly new therapists require close supervision and, Iwould almost say, nurturing. Wedon't train clones and, even intheir late twenties, students have some life experience to build on.They need tobeintouch with what they feel, nottryto\"sell\" themselves as something that they arenotandbegrounded insome theory that they canbelieve in. Itisperhaps necessary tomake once again thedistinction here between theory of practice and theory ofthought. Irequire coherence between what Ido,what Ibelieve andtheoretical information that provides adirection and structure that isnecessary for each consultation. The inter-psychic explanations tend toputalloftheeggs inone basket. Ego Psychology and Object Relations held less professional appeal tothe practitioner inme, inthat each offered aparticular perspective Iwas less interested specifically inindividual behavior. Interpretations appeared torely onsingulaz explanations and were rarely challenged bypatients. Myearly training, ingroups, had been informed byapsychoanalytic aswell asapsychodynamic point ofview. Of interest intellectually, Ienjoyed learning about groups, which included theTavistock Group Relations (Rice, 1965), T-groups (Lewin, 1976), Transactional 1996) aswell Association). some ofthe underlying theories: the Tavistock was informed byananalytic approach and encouraged anger and acting out, T-Groups seemed tohave less todowith Lewin and soon.Transactional Analysis was friendly butputfixed labels onpeople and their behavior. One learns from allof them butIhad concerns about each. Also, Iwas seazching foraguiding theory that dealt with people, relationships andcontext. The theories that interested mewere those that went further than the ones they replaced inidentifying the vagaries ofhuman behavior. Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela (1988) provided biological descriptions atatime when thegenome was ofmore interest than quantum physics. Itwas thetime ofglasnost inRussia, the Solidarity movement inPoland and, perhaps Tomm who introduced Chilean biologists Maturana and Varela tofamily therapy. He, with anumber ofinembers of histeam, has worked diligently tointroduce new ideas into thefield. The fact that there was such ready acceptance oftheir ideas couched inalanguage that was not always simple tograsp, tomethat tomove on-certainly the atfirst, was forany ofus.We had lost something ofthe relationship with ourclients and had never fully believed intheblack box. Harry Goolishian andHazlene Anderson (1988), among others, began tospeak oftherapy as conversation and Michael White and David Epston (White and Epston, 1990) in Australia started writing about narrative therapy. Although both sets ofideas were not 126entirely new tothef\"ield, theapproach ourcolleagues were introducing was creative and satisfying. Chileans were received readily bymany ofuswho were seeking out thelarger ones notnecessarily Along with we were interested inhow change happened. Before Ielaborate onthe impact ofthe filling thedialogue many \"yes, but\" ofhisandMaturana's ideas Lastly been very much influenced bythework ofFritjof Capra (1996), anAustrian physicist who has written extensively and with great clarity onthephilosophical implications ofmodern science. His book, \"The Web ofLife\" myown ideas andVarela. from Vazela therefore notalways credit Capra directly for that material. Iwill however acknowledge both hismastery ofthesubject theory iscentered onthenotion ofautopoiesis, which describes how living systems interact with one another andtheir environment. The word autopoiesis isderived from two ancient Greek words, `auto' meaning self and `poiesis' denoting production orcreation. For Maturana the theory ofautopoiesis was away of understanding cognitive phenomena. Simply put, thetheory was based ontheway living systems address and engage within thedomains inwhich they operate: all living systems arecognitive -ofknowledge. All living systems aredefined criteria and process (Capra, 1996, p.67). Maturana and Vazela distinguished between structure and organization: organization was purpose they may possibly tothephysical asopposed to thedescriptive elements ofanobject orperson -their chemical composition that makes them what they aze. Both thecontext and thestructure adapt toeach other over time. Change happens through what they called structural coupling which istheunderlying process of cognition. The structure may change according totheelements introduced bythe environment, butonecannot predict what that change will look like. My personal experience, that has remained with meallofthese years, was when Maturana dramatically opened yetanother door tothenotion that weknow what weknow and learn through other methods than explanations. (Ifound this very reassuring forsome reason, perhaps because itmeant that Ihadalways been right about therapists who gave advice that was only received ifthe `hearer' was prepared. And thatwehadnoidea how thisadvisement was understood.) Family Therapy InThe 21st Century Family therapy has been blessed with anumber ofinteresting individuals who introduced ways ofworking with clients and new ways ofdescribing their work. Michael White ofthe Dulwich Centre inSouth Australia, best known forhis came into thefield ofsocial collar occupation. His work somewhat isthespirit ofMil[on Erickson (1980). One example isthe technique everyone isattempting to`cure' ofthis rather bad habit. White, along with New Zealander David Epston, hasalso written extensively about their experience with the nanative form oftherapy, including White's book ontransparency intherapy (White, need andtransparent didaway with the \"behind themirror\" conversations about thefamily tothereflecting teams that have conversations inthepresence and with thefamily. The dark viewing room with its one way mirror that separated the\"supervision team\" from the\"therapist team\" was powerful stuff. We could one day wedecided toshaze these discussions with our clients. Many people have been credited with this shift and oneofthefirst todescribe hiswork inwriting about itwas Norwegian psychiatrist Tom Andersen (1987) .Like many others, Iabandoned theenclave behind theone way mirror many years ago, in part outofsheer discomfort and theconviction that our clients know agreat deal about their own story when provided with theself protective shroud ofmystery. This systems inpeople's lives, including that ofwork. This was reflected in training psychiatrists bybeginning with aninquiry into their patient's entire system, with anemphasis onwork. Who were thepeople thepatient worked with and what didthey do;what were those relationships like? Idiscovered that many physicians had noidea what anorganizational chart looked like. This approach hasalso reduced theconceit among young therapists ofknowing itall.Alittle humility isnotabad thing. The advantages oftheextended systemic focus, aswell asdistinctions shed between therapy and consultation that discouraged pathologizing, were soon apparent tomy group oftrainees asthey became more skilled inunderstanding thebroader lifeof those with whose caze they were charged. They quickly leamed that families had multiple roles andthat their patients belonged tomultiple systems. Focus OnAlcoholism: AnAccidental Specialty 129For many years, myown work with families was largely defined bywho came into theclinic. Asateacher, supervisor and clinician Iwas able toseeagreat variety of anassortment alcoholism was notofparticular interest, thenumber ofpeople referred tousmade learning more imperative. Among prominent family therapists working with alcoholism, was Peter Steinglass (1976), who isnow theDirector oftheAckennan Center inN.Y. The American literature was over ofalcoholic and even Steinglass represented thispoint 1981). Wesaw families any Curiosity led meconduct afollow upstudy oftwelve families with analcohol abusing member two years after treatment. George Valiant (1983), who hasdone themost extensive study ofmale alcoholics over forty years suggested tomethat two year follow upsdonot constitute research. However, Ihad discovered that three oftheindividuals that we had seen intheclinic, who had taken great strides inchanging their lives, had died. One male ofthegroup was over fifty, theother female and male were intheir late forties. Two haddied ofcancer, oneofliver disease, which was less surprising. Ofthe other nine, sixhad moved outofBelgium. The association with early death after detoxification, ofsomeihing other than pancreatic orliver disease, orchanges inbrain cell activity, notdocumented intheliterature and Iwas therefore concerned as well ascurious. After further inquiries into thehealth of\"recovering\" alcoholics, I was more confused then before. However, Iwas equally interested tounderstand better theimpact ofinterventions with these families. The Americans aresobriety driven: inEurope wealso prioritize detoxification, without always astowhy these people haddied, also one was that ifthere was tobechange, itwould have tobeinthelarger context and that it should notbeforced. This seemed asomewhat generic observation inthat thesystem appears toorganize itself around behavior that isassociated with that consumption. And who isthemost bothered and how dothey manifest that concern? My other two hypothesis that one ofthe higher powers often referred tointhe treatment of alcoholism might reside somewhere inthelazger context that also included thefamily andthat secrecy, notonly about thedrinking, played arole inisolating these people from what should have been their daily lives. Ireferred tothis higher power as\"the system ofinfluence\", those inthesystem who held thepower, either through information oranauthority with which wewere not familiar. (Ipostulate that this nucleus could also befound inother systems.) One can further hypothesize that allofthis tomaintain inwhat has been called enabling. Nor inevitably thecolleagues atwork who help with the cover up, but acombination ofefforts that are not necessarily coordinated but maintain theself-regulation ofthesystem, which includes notonly thedrinking hypothesis, itbecomes tounderstand better what other purpose this `system ofinfluence' serves and who is helped byit.Unlike most \"programs\" that dealt with alcoholism, mydecision saw it. Also, Iopened thedoor toexploring how they had been successful indealing with other \"problems\" that they had confronted. Itisthefamily that was knowledgeable about how they had dealt with similaz concerns, aswell asdisagreements.

Ihave notalways been satisfied with the relationships that weco-created with clients, andthis was especially true ofthose who drank. There was largely astereotypical attitude towards drinking problems. Wives or partners were quickly identified asco-dependents and patients, often tobefound on medical wards and treated with disrespect. InAmerica they lectured them, asifthis was supposed tobehelpful and inEurope wewere also notespecially respectful. Families would present themselves with areluctant drinking member and wefound more elegant methods ofblaming them than theAmericans. What Roussaux, Derely and Mme. Van Den Bosch who were knowledgeable collaborators. THREE PHASES OF TREATMENT OFEXCESSIVE USE OF ALCOHOL (As classified byWHO) We divided theconsultation process into three phases: thefirst was toidentify, with those present, thesystem that somehow aided and abetted intheno-change aspect of thesystem; and what purpose i[served. Most important, thefirst call forhelp ina system with with \"patient\", unwillingly to be\"taken care of'bytheexperts. We decided tobegin with the person requesting assistance, almost never the designated \"alcoholic\" and most frequently thespouse orpartner. Inother words, we would say\"Please come and tousand bring everyone else inthe family tohelp you're theone who knows, andyou arealso suffering.\" This was explained when first By changing theroles oftroubled andhelper, weimmediately quite operate ona\"business asusual\" basis. modify the story. Italso encouraged achange inthelanguage andinsome oftherules. the drinking individual argue totake back therole oftheproblem bearer and we 132found that this also facilitated entry into detoxification, when itwas indicated. This could bephase two and was administered bythehospital. However, hospital staff who were exposed toour changed definitions would, over time, adapt toachanged perspective. Having scarce hospital beds occupied bysomeone identified asan alcoholic often angers hospital staff, particulazly since this type ofpatient isoften Idesigned was focused onthefollowing; for family members tobegin taking responsibility fortheir own needs, notonly those of thealcohol abusing member andtobetter understand therole ofdrinking person inthesystem. Italso focused onidentifying thesystem ofinfluence. The second dealt with usually carried outinahospital, under thecaze ofaphysician. Although Dr. Roussaux conducted several \"athome\" supervised detoxifications, Iwas personally razely involved with this process. My own experience suggests that adetox onamedical rather than apsychiatric wazd hassome benefits -theprimary one being that theproblem isnotimmediately perceived asa psychiatric symptom. Also, the medically supervised detox can identify health problems more efficiently. The third phase normally takes place inthehospital. This involves bringing together allofthose who arelikely toinvolve themselves inthelifeofthefamily, others who wethought should, and particulazly those powerful few who have been identified as thesystem ofinfluence. Basically, weask each member ofthe extended family, including thechildren, toinvite someone who would come astheir exclusive support. The individual who abused substance also isrequired tochoose someone other than their partner.

Americans were taken bythetheory that alcoholism runs infamilies, especially among thechildren ofalcoholics. There were studies oftwins who were separated at birth buthad abiological parent who drank excessively that supported some ofthese ideas. Mycuriosity ledmetointerview forty-four sets ofsibGngs with atleast one drinking parent. They ranged inage from late teens tofifty-four. Their stories were filled with memories ofabuse, neglect and anger aswell asdisrupted relationships, in and outside the family.

Among family therapists, positions onself-disclosure and transpazency have been emphasized byBowen (1978), the feminist therapists Goldner (1985) and Hare Mustin (1978), narrative therapy byWhite, Epston (1990), Whittaker (1982), asBortolino were among thefirst, asinMahlick, van Ormer andSimi (2000). The current literature dealing more directly with theperson ofthetherapist includes a diverse group ofwriters. Rowan and Jacobs' work isaneclectic, somewhat loose approach toexamining the `selves' ofthe therapist that they identify as instrumental, Itisalso inpart byWhite (1997), White, C.,and Hales (1997). Michael White, the author ofthe first book, puts forth the interesting view that itin becoming a professional, thetherapist disqualifies and discipline' inthe`formalization of knowledge, persons become differently knowledged' (p.17); the price isa disconnection with one's own context ofreference. White continues, `Toknow that weknow what weknow, and with theclinical than philosophy and personal belief systems, isWeiner (1978, 1983). This book is clearly written byaknowledgeable, long-time clinician, and inthat way themost thorough ofthe ones that Ihave read. Although operating primarily from a psychodynamic, individual and group therapy perspective, Weiner deals effectively with thepros and cons ofself-disclosure inaclinical setting. What isespecially significant inthe self-disclosure isthenumber ofjournal publications onthat Horne (1999), Harris, Dersch, and Mittal (1999), Timm and Blow (1999) Carlson and Erickson (1999).

The relationship between therapists and clients has always been ofconcern. Transparency intheform ofopenness andself-disclosure may have begun with Freud who, inthemidst ofatherapy session with hisclient the Wolfman, shared the information that hissonhadbeen inanaccident and hadbeen hurt butwas recovering (Freud, 1909). Other clues about Freud's personal discussions with clients have been talked about but, nevertheless, hecriticized Sandor professor and analyst, once interjected, inthemidst Rounds byinjecting anote ofpersonal into the therapy. This apparently was meant asanote ofwarning that even thetraditional among analysts needed tostep out ofthe rigid and distant posture that they maintained. Ithink back toCarl Rogers and hisclient-centered therapy that troubled mesomany years ago.

Inpsychotherapy, especially groups, itwas the moment of 144encounters, ofbonding holding and hugging clients, aphysical boundary Icould notcross formany years -and then, very rarely andprimarily with women who had been sexually abused orotherwise violated. Iagreed with Karl Meninger who has been quoted ascalling thetransgression ofphysical contact between therapist and client taboo.

Timing seemed more important than what was said. The new understanding inthehumanistic approach was that healing intherapy will emerge from the therapeutic relationship, but this fragile relationship needs tobe managed with honesty, with good clinical judgment andwith great care.

Both authors assert that psychology hasstill notmoved perceptibly from that position. Feminist writers' efforts todisengage from thearchaic concept ofwomen's identity that defined byapatemalistic society hasresulted inwriters such asCarol Gilligan (1982), Institute (Carter, Papp, Silverstein, andWalters, 1988) and thenumerous articles and studies bytheCenter forResearch onWomen attheStone Center identity evolves.

Social constructionists describe selves, including individual psychological traits, as social and historical constructions.

This isnotonly who isjudiciously assessing thetherapist.

And what weknow ishow itaffected ourparents. And now ourown children donotreally know how these memories influence us.

Inmyedited vision, I had not been touched bythewaz, and therefore itcould not easily influence my relationships, present orfuture.

The impact ontherapy and thetherapeutic relationship hasbeen dramatic, and, Ibelieve ithas been anadditional factor inthe major turn to medication, influenced bythose changes and, ofcourse, the phazmaceutical duration ofthe process.

The political climate appeazs tobemoving much towrite InMeditations declares, `Iammyself plus mycircumstances' (1984). Ithought my generation had lived with only possibilities, butIused tofeel somewhat sony forthe future therapists, living with constraints. Now Irather envy them. They have the potential fornew horizons intherapy relationships -those that azemore honest, more open, more transparent. Iwish them luck. The question iswhether someone eazly life isdefined bythat or,asWilliam James has asked, whether one must consider thesocial, spiritual and material self that hasemerged during those yeazs of growth. Paul John Eakin, inHow Our Lives Become Stories, comments that identity formation isnotavailable forconscious inspection because itisaprocess. For this reason, rather self, than they reveaL Itisn't useful, butitisn't pathological. Most clients have been predetermining what wemay ormay notfind relevant, orwhat they themselves find relevant. They further choose nottoshare information that they feaz may present them inapoor light.

Both arenewed therapeutic relationship and a newly aware therapist are information about transformation, achanging world, a shifting contex[ andanew paradigm that waits fornoone. 165SUMMARY This dissertation into thenature Transparency inrelationships isfurther defined asone that isopen, authentic and contained by boundaries that are flexible and regulated bythe unique requirements ofeach situation. The dissertation further addresses itself totheself reflexive inquiry -ofapersonal and professional these newly emerging needs inthe field ofinental health. This includes thechanges inthetheory and practice social construction aswell asthose specific tothelifeofthetherapist. The first chapter, Methodology, compares qualitative and quantitative reseazch and justifies theuseofautobiographic narrative research. The second chapter, The Personal Narrative, deals with theHolocaust andthechild's experience ofthewar. The autobiographical narrative, written inthefirst person, is interspersed with constructionist descriptions oftheways meanings areconstructed in interaction with others, and isintertwined with theadult therapist's reflections onhow thevarious incidents inthechild's experience have influenced theadult's therapeutic decisions. The third chapter, The Professional Narrative, examines the major themes -the evolution oftheprofession(al) and theinfluences -that have connects thetheory with theconceptual material ofthenarrative -the person ofthe therapist and the construction considerations arealso connected toother issues: andsecrets, and their place andthetherapeutic relationship. The fifth chapter, Conclusions, summarizes theuseofnarrative autobiography asa method ofstudying new issues inpsychotherapy that involve clientltherapist relationships, and inparticulaz those that aze connected tothe potential place of to become more transparent intheir relationships with clients. Icanonly repeat that my focus hasbeen theexperienced therapist who isattempting tointegrate many changes -from sanctioned disclosure from insurance tomedication -intheir work. AsIhave said earlier, the\"new\" therapists have inherited adifferent world. They have less autonomy because ofthepower of insurance buthave been trained totake into account many changes intherelationship with clients. Atpresent, thefocus isonamore biological form aplethora ofinformation of uswho thought wewere being respectful inrejecting oneway mirrors and sharing our process notes when relevant (orwriting very few), still have along way with methodology. Eakin isnotagainst thetherapists to understand what influenced `famous' colleagues. This will necessitate creating and testing anopen ended setofinterview questions which was difficult todowhile Iwas intheprocess ofwriting this dissertation. I'm only now getting asense ofwhat questions Imight explore. Any suggestions from myrespec[ed readers will bevery welcome indeed. 4.Irefer tothepost WW2 years, the60sand 70sasa\"renaissance time\".

Intraining family therapists, Ihave always designed exercises that examine those parts ofthetrainee's lifestory with which they may have still been struggling. We also included family genograms that allow theopportunity fortrainees tobring forth some oftherules andissues intheir own families. However, theintent was self learning, rather than how their personal history would impact their future work asatherapist. 17112.The Holocaust refers most frequently totheapproximately sixmillion Jews who were systematically murdered between theyeazs 1939 and 1945 inNazi occupied Europe.
