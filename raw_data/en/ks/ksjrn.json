This system of medicine is different from others as it is based on individual consideration for every different patients. \"The problems of different patients are identified based on his or her individuality, which is worked out by various factors like heredity, environment, social and worksphere,\" Since Homeopathy works through a holistic approach, taking a broad view of any individual's condition, Homeopathic practitioners must familiarize themselves thoroughly with each patient before recommending a remedy. Two individuals with same conditions might require different remedies. Factors that affect prescription include health history, body type, emotional tendencies, mental symptoms and specific details of recent symptoms. According to homeopathic principle of \"like cures like,\" taking the wrong type of remedy may result in a new, undesirable symptoms. If you seek homeopathic treatment, consult a qualified professional always. A systematic review in 2007 found that highly diluted homeopathic remedies, taken under the supervision of trained professionals, are generally safe and unlikely to cause severe adverse reactions. However, like any drug or dietary supplement, these products could pose risks if they are improperly manufactured (for example, if they are contaminated with microorganisms or if they are incorrectly diluted). In order to find out effectiveness of a homeopathic medicine in treating various cases, Homeopaths perform experiments called \" drug provings\" (derived from the German word pruefung, meaning test) in which healthy people are given continual doses of a potentized medicine. Although not everyone is sensitive to potentized doses of each substance, some people will develop symptoms for that particular substance in each medicine. In summary, you can develop symptoms from taking a homeopathic medicine, though these symptoms rarely last very long and will usually go away shortly after the person stops taking the remedy. [It is a myth that there are no 'side-effects'with Homeopathy] Anytime a remedy or conventional medicine is given in overdose, it will produce side-effects.If this were not so, homeopathy could not conduct its pathogenic trials (PROVINGS) The difference between chemical side-effects from conventional medicines and the energetic side-effects of homeopathic remedies is that energetic effects are usually minor and do not harm, poison or create addiction. They just indicate that the remedy has been given in too large doses, too often, or in an unsuitable potency. Once the remedy is stopped, they disappear. Qualified and skilled homeopaths not only prescribe the right remedy but also adjust the potency, dose and frequency of that remedy to suit the person's sensitivity, so unwanted effects are avoided. Unlike chemical-based medicines, homeopathy can't poison or produce toxic or dangerous side-effects .This is because homeopathy is an 'energy medicine' that works on the subtle energy of the human body to stimulate healing. Since there are no chemicals involved, toxic side-effects and poisonings are avoided. The only time a short-lived \"aggravation\" will be noticed is when: The remedy is a close match to the person's symptoms but the dose is too frequent or too strong for what is needed The remedy is not specifically good match for the person's symptoms but close enough to trigger a response In either case, any symptoms produced are generally mild, non-toxic and don't last for long. In the first instance, if you stop dosing, a rapid improvement will follow the aggravation. The remedy should only be repeated when improvement stops or symptoms start to return - and then in a gentler dose. In the second instance, the settling aggravation will not be followed by an improvement in the pre-existing symptoms as it was not a close enough match to trigger the necessary healing response - a better matching remedy should be chosen. It is a very friendly health care system and it is well known that homeopathic medicines have no known harmful side effects. This fact has stood the test of time and is a strong point of homeopathy but this does not mean that one can pick any medicine and start using it. In most cases there are dozens of medicines for apparently similar ailment but each of those cannot be used in every case. It must be chosen according to symptoms peculiar to the individual. Incorrectly chosen medicine may result in disappointment. This is why self-medication, inappropriate use or repetition of doses without the advice of a professional homeopath is not recommended. One should prefer to consult an experienced homeopath. It is certainly true that the raw materials for many homeopathic medicines are known poisons. And yet, every toxicologist knows that a substance is poisonous only in a certain dose. In effect, every sunstance can be poisonous in certain doses. Too much oxygen can impede respiration, and too much calcium will lead to brittle bones. Homeopathic medicines are manufactured through a specific pharmaceutical process called \"potentization\" in which the substance is serially diluted, . As a result of the small doses used, there is general consensus that homeopathic medicines that are presently available are basically safe. The small doses used in homeopathy make its nearly impossible to elicit a poisonous effect. As famed violinist and philanthropist Yehudi Menuhin once said, \"Homeopathy is one of the few medical specialties which carries no penalties-only benefits.\" People should take a homeopathic medicine for a limited time and only when the person is experiencing a specific set of symptoms for which the medicine is indicated. If these symptoms disappear, it is not necessary to take the medicine any longer. If the symptoms change, it may be necessary to take a different remedy or formula that most accurately fits the new set of symptoms. A healing crisis is an exacerbation of certain symptoms in the body's efforts to heal a deeper condition. It is, for instance, relatively common for people with chronic ailments to experience an externalization of symptoms in the process of cure, that is, a person with a recurrent respiratory condition may develop a skin rash in the healing process. The body always seeks to protect its deepest and most vital functions, and it always tries to externalize stress and discharge infective agents. Although a person may experience some new or old symptoms after taking a homeopathic medicine, they are thought to be part of the healing process when they are following Hering's laws. When they are not, it is generally assumed that the homeopathic medicine is not working and the person's condition is getting worse. Modern botanical, biochemical, and pharmacological methods allow manufacturers to properly identify medicinal substances used, and the use of double- and triple-distilled water for the process of dilution assures a high level of purity to homeopathic products. Contamination after manufacture of a homeopathic product is highly unlikely due to the various protective seals that manufacturers use on their bottles and boxes. Although there are no known contraindications to taking homeopathic medicines, homeopathic practitioners and industry leaders recognize that consumers should not be encouraged to treat themselves or their families for any chronic or serious ailment. Such conditions require the assessment and treatment of a trained doctor.A systematic review found that highly diluted homeopathic remedies, taken under the supervision of trained professionals, are generally safe and unlikely to cause severe adverse reactions. In Delhi, a government body, Sriram Institute of Industrial Research, is authorised to test homeopathic medicines for steroids. They gave a clean slate. Self-medication is another danger. Doctors complain that patients having found a medicine which can cure their cold/cough, go back to it without first consulting them. In homeopathic terminology, the effectiveness of remedies is proved by experimentation and reporting done by famous homeopathic practitioners. Most of the polycrest (a medicine of many uses) medicines have a broad sphere of action and they affect almost every part of human body including the endocrine system.Improved hormonal levels and a generally improved health is what is responsible for feeling of well being; rather it is the first sign that the medicine is working well and is the right medicine for the patient and ideally this feeling should not be temporary like in case of artificial hormones.
