Founders Keith and Lin Hughes, both proud veterans, co-owner and operate the business along with their children Amy and Ryan. As the only veteran-owned solar company in the Puget Sound area, we are proud to offer a 10% discount off of the labor on both solar and electrical jobs to all veterans every day!
