Among these are certain blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma; tumors like neuroblastoma; blood diseases like aplastic anemia and sickle cell disease; and immune and genetic diseases. Bone marrow is spongy tissue found inside your large bones. It is responsible for making blood cells including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. It is also home to your im mune system. All of these cells are very important, so a change in bone marrow function can ha ve life-threatening effects on your body. In a bone marrow transplant, old bone marrow cells are replaced by new ones. You may need a bone marrow transplant IF: (1) Your bone marrow is defective, contai ning either cancer cells or other abnormal types of blood cells (e xample - sickle cells), OR (2) Your bone marrow is not strong enough to survive the effects of high dose chemotherapy. For example, patients with tumors often require high doses of chemotherapy to kill their tumor ce lls. This chemotherapy may also be strong enough to destroy your blood and bone marrow cells. In this case, the bone marrow transplant is given as a rescue, to allow new bone marrow and blood cells to grow. 8A basic overview of the transplant pr ocess is shown in Diagram 1. We will discuss each of these steps in detail in th e following sections of this document. Diagram 1: Overview of the transplant process What are stem cells? Blood cells grow in the same way as other cells in our body grow. They develop in the bone marrow from a parent cell known as a \"stem cell.\" These stem cells begin to divide and mature until they are fully de veloped, forming all the different types of blood cells: white bl ood cells, platelets an d red blood cells. How do we collect stem cells? In order to undergo a transplant, we must obtain stem cells from a donor. The process of collecting these cells is calle d harvesting. There are two basic ways to harvest or collect stem cells: Bone marrow harves t: The stem cells are coll ected directly from the hip bone of a donor. Blood stem cell harvest : The stem cells are coll ected directly from the blood (veins) of a donor. Conditioning (Chemo and/or Radiation) Infusion of new stem cells Recovery from Transplant (Monitoring for complications) Pre-transplant Evaluation 9Bone Marrow Harvest Bone marrow cells (stem cells) are normal ly located deep inside your bones, primarily found in your backbone (verte brae), hip bone (pelvis), thigh bone (femur), skull and ribs. Your hip bone (pelvis) in particular, contains large amounts of bone marrow. In a bone marrow harvest, doctors obtain bone marrow cells (stem cells) from the hip bone of the donor. Th e process can take 1-3 hours to collect, on one day. The do nor is put asleep (u nder anesthesia) for the procedure, given the discomfort they would otherwis e feel from the procedure. Refer to the Marrow Harv est Fast Fact Sheet in the RESOURCES Section for further details. Blood Stem Cell Harvest Bone marrow (stem cells) can also be collected (harvested) from the bloodstream. At any given moment, there are stem cells present in your blood stream, traveling from one bone marrow site to another. A sp ecial machine, called an apheresis machine, filter s these stem cells from the bloodstream. The apheresis process takes 3 hours per day. It will take 1-4 days to collect enough stem cells for tr ansplant. The donor is awake during the apheresis procedure. Refer to the Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Apheresis Fast Fact Sheet in the RESOURCES Section for further details. There are potential advantages and disadvantages with ea ch type of collection. Your doctor will discuss the best way to collect stem cells fo r your transplant. 10Types of Transplant There are two basic types of transplants, autologous and allogeneic, depending on who donates the bone marrow or stem cells. In autologous transplants, the patient donates his or her own stem cells prior to treatment and receives them back later. In allogeneic transplants, the donor is someone other than yourself, either a family member (related dono r), an individual from a bone marrow registry (unrelated donor) , or a cord blood from a cord blood registry. Diagram 2 summarizes the two basic types of transplants. Diagram 2: Types of transplant Autologous Transplant - th e patient donates his or he r own stem cells prior to treatment and receives them back later. Related Donor Transplant- stem cells are donated from a genetically matched family member (usually a brother or sister). Genetic matching; called HLA matching is done from a blood sample. Unrelated Donor Transplant- a type of allogeneic transplant in which the stem cells are donated by someone other than a family member. This donor is found in one of the worldwide do nor registries. The University of Michigan is a participating center in the National Marrow Donor Program. Cord Blood Transplant- Umbilical cord blood is collected from the umbilical Autologous Transplants Allogeneic Transplants Related (family) donor Unrelated donor Cord blood donor 11cord and placenta after a ba by is born. This blood is rich in stem cells. The donated cord blood is tested , frozen and stored at a cord blood bank for future use. The cord blood unit may be obtained from a family member (brother or sister) or selected from a regist ry of donated cord blood units. Syngeneic Transplant - the person donating the stem cells is an identical twin. Your doctor will discuss what type of transplant is avai lable and best for you. 12Your Health Care Team The transplant team includes the follo wing professionals: Doctors While undergoing your transplant, medica l care is provided by a transplant doctor. He or she sees yo u on a daily basis to examine you, answer questions you may have and keep you informed of yo ur progress. Responsibilities of the transplant doctors change every 2 w eeks. This means you will have the opportunity to receive care from many doctors on our team during your hospitalization and recovery period. We ekly meetings of th e doctors and other team members keep everyone up-to-date on the status of every patient. After transplant, if you are an autologous patient you will see th e transplant doctor at 30 and 100 days post-transplant and then will return to the care of your primary hematologist. If you are an allogeneic patient you will continue to be seen by the transplant doctor for regular follow-up visits for at least the first 100 days, and then less frequently for the remainder of the first year after transplant. Pre-Transplant Nurse Coordinators Your pre-transplant nurse coordinator tracks your treatment prior to your transplant admission and plans the nece ssary testing and tr eatment you will need at the Cancer Cent er to get ready for transplant. The BMT nurse coordinator also plans your donor's sc hedule. The BMT nurse coordinator is your primary contact as you work your way toward transplant. 13 Inpatient Nurses These nurses are educ ated in the care and special needs of transplant patients. Your inpatient staff nurses organize yo ur care from the time you are admitted until you are discharged from the hospital. They will meet with you soon after admission to discuss the tran splant process and what wi ll be expected of you. They also will be availabl e to help you an d your family wi th physical or emotional problems as they arise. BMT Clinic Nurses Once you are discharged, the outpatient clinic nurses will help develop your plan of care in the outpatient setting and will assist you and your caregiver through the recovery process. Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants These caregivers have advanc ed training in transplant patient care and have day- to-day responsibility for your care while you are in the hospital or in the clinic. They work in close collabor ation with the doctors in both the inpatient an d outpatient setting. Social Workers Part of your required tran splant preparation is an initial assessment with a soci al worker that will give you the opportunity to disc uss non-medical needs and other concerns you may have. Transplant is a stressful event for you as a patient an d on your support system. Social work is available for supportive counsel ing and therapy during the enti re transplant process. 14Dietitians The transplant dietit ians meet with you to expl ain the special diet you will follow during your hospital stay and at home post-trans plant. They also works with you to set nutrition goals to prevent weight loss, follow your nutrition intake and offer suggestions on how to achieve your nutrition requirements. The dietitian is available to you afte r you are discharged and during your recovery as your appetite returns to normal. Clinical Pharmacists A clinical pharmacist participates in the planning of your chemotherapy and other medication you receive as an outp atient or inpatient. He or she is available to answer questions you may ha ve about the medica tions you receive. Blood Bank Technologists This person coordinates al l blood products for transp lant patients and their donors. He or she processes all stem cell products after harvesting and coordinates the apheresis procedures. Physical/Occupational Therapists If you are receiving an allogeneic tr ansplant, a physical and occupational therapist will see and assist you while you ar e in the hospital, to help you maintain your strength and endura nce during and after transplant. Inpatient Spiritual Care A spiritual care counselor is a supportive care resource for coping with the stress of transplant. They are available to provide you with spiritual and re ligious resources. 15Team Members for Pediatric Patients Child Life Specialists: Child & Family Life professionals are integral members of your child's healthcare team both in the inpatient and ou tpatient settings. Child Life Specialists, Activity Therapists and Creative Arts professionals create soothing environments and offer developmentally appropriate programs for children and teens that are educational, therapeutic and recreational. These include: medical play and education to he lp young people understand and prepare for treatment experiences; distraction, relaxation and imagery techniques to minimize anxiety and strengthen coping skills; play and activity progra ms focused on mastery, choice and self esteem and technology opportunities. As your child or teen returns to school, Child Life Specialists can communicate with academic staff, and even classmat es, to explain various aspects of the young person's treatment, address questions and develop plans for a successful transition. The Child & Fa mily Life team is committed to family centered care and especially, the well being of siblings. Siblings are celebrated, encouraged to share feelings and included in the he althcare experience as often as possible. Teachers: Teachers are available to work with your child while they are admitted for their bone ma rrow transplant process. You should speak with your school to determine what work ne eds to be done while your child is admitted. 16 17Preparing For Transplant Preparing for transplant can be a difficul t time for patients and their families. The length of time leading to transplant varies. The process of \"tissue typing\" family members for potential donors or the search proces s for an unrelated donor can be time consuming and emotio nally straining. Some patients may need additional chemotherapy or radiation to reduce their disease further, prior to coming to transplant. Furtherm ore, additional testing is necessary to determine each person's eligibility for transplant. Whether these issues take days or months depends on several things, including the type of transplant you are anticipating, your disease status, an d your general state of health. We will try to give you an approximate time fr ame so that you can make the necessary preparations for your admiss ion and recovery period. Preparing for an Autologous Transplant Diagram 3: Pre-transplant process: AUTOLOGOUS transplant The First Step involves a consultation with th e transplant team. Your medical history is reviewed, information about bone marrow transplants is shared, and Initial Consultation Disease Status Evaluation Organ Function Evaluation First Step Second Step Consultations Third Step Stem cell mobilization and collection procedure Admit for Trans plant Secure a Caregiver Plan 18a physical exam is perfor med to determine if a bone marrow transplant is the appropriate treatment option for you. The Second Step will include several appointments . The testing associated with this visit will examine your organ function and disease status, which will help determine your eligibility to proceed to transp lant. Your diagnosis and health history will guide what tests are ordered. The test results wi ll be submitted to your insurance company for approval of the transplant procedure. You can expect the following appointments: A Clinic Appointment: The transplant doctor and nurse coor dinator will meet with you to discus s your transplant options. You will receive documents called consents that re view the recommended treatment regimens for you. The nurse coordi nator will conduct an educational overview of transplant during this visit. Assessment of Disease Status: If you have a history of leukemia or cancer involving the bone marrow, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy procedure will be done. In addition, a sp inal tap (lumbar puncture) may be done, depending on your disease type. Other testing that may be scheduled includes: MRI, PFT, Echocardiogram, MUGA Scan, Blood X-Ray, EKG, CT scan, and PET/CT Scan. Consult Appointments may include specialty areas of Cardiology, Dentistry, Radiation Oncology, Ophthalmology and Gynecology. A Social Work Appointment: Along with the social worker, you will discuss your unde rstanding of the transplant process and anticipated recovery period, and how you may co pe during this time. The social 19worker will talk to you about suppor t and coping resources that you may have or need to identify, resources that your caregive rs may require, financial information, referrals fo r lodging, and other needs. This appointment may be done over the phone or in person. Securing a Caregiver Plan: A successful transplant requires commitment not only from the pati ent and medical team, bu t from the patient's support system as well. Each autolo gous transplant patient requires a minimum of 1 primary caregiver and 1 back-up caregiver. Pediatric transplant patients will need caregivers with them during hospitalizations and outpat ient visits. Being a caregiver for a transplant patient is a vital role in the transplant process. Ag reeing to fill this role is a serious commitment. Along with this book you will receive a folder of forms that need to be returned to the transplant team. One of these form s is called the Caregiver Responsibilities Agreement. This form outlines the responsibilities your caregivers will face and each caregiver will need to review and sign this form. The transplant team will need to receive a completed form that reflects your caregiver plan befo re you are admitted for transplant. Securing a reliable caregiver plan can be challenging for many patients and families. Family members and friends often work and have other 20responsibilities. Often, a \"caregiver plan\" consists of a number of people who are available to assist at various times and with specific duties/needs. Being a caregiver does not require medical experience. Examples of potential caregiver option s that other patients/families have utilized can be found in the RESOURCES section of this handbook. Remember, a single option may not pr ovide an adequate caregiver plan; combining a number of the options will often fulfill the need for a reliable caregiver plan. The Third step in the transplant process is call ed \"stem cell mobilization and apheresis (stem cell collection).\" This st age involves the colle ction of stem cells from your body. Diagram 4 illustrates the collection process. D i a g r a m 4 : T h e s t e m cell collection process Mobilization of Stem Cells - The mobilization of stem cells refers to the administration of a chemotherapy agent plus daily injections of a bone marrow growth factor (typically Neupogen \u00ae). The combination of chemotherapy and Neupogen\u00ae pushes stem cells out of your bone marrow and into your bloodstream. In this manner, they can later be collected. The chemotherapy is usually given in the infusion area of the Cancer Center, and involves a 2 day process. The chemotherapy is Chemotherapy Neupogen\u00ae administered Apheresis 1-2 days ~ 10 days 1-4 days Mobilization of stem cells Stem cell collection 21administered on the first day and additional IV fl uids are often given on the second day. Apheresis - Apheresis refers to the proces s used to collect stem cells. Blood is passed through an IV from your body and into the apheresis machine. The apheresis machine then filters the stem cells out the blood stream, and separates them from the re st of the blood cells. These stem cells can then be frozen for later use. The apheresis procedure usually begins about 10 days after the chemotherapy is given. The procedure takes 3 hours per day, and can range from 1 - 4 days in duration. Your doctors calculate how many stem cells they want to collect from you. The colle ction continues until they reach this target goal. The apheresis procedure is done in th e outpatient setting. You do not need to be asleep for the procedure. Refer to the Apheresis Fast Fact Sheet in the RESOURCES section of this handbook for further information. Following a successful harvest procedure, you will then have a final evaluation for the bone marrow transplant. Some of the organ function testing and/or disease status testing may ne ed to be repeated at this time, depending upon the length of time since it was last performed. 22 Preparing for an Allogeneic Transplant Diagram 5: Pre-transpla nt process: ALLOGENEIC transplant The First Step is a consultation with the transplant team. Your medical history is reviewed, information about the transp lant process is shared, and a physical exam is conducted to determine if a bone marrow tr ansplant is th e appropriate treatment option for you. Some blood work may be done. The preliminary blood testing that is required to identify a donor may be drawn. The Second Step will include several appointmen ts. The testing associated with this visit will examin e your organ function and disease status, which will help determine your eligibility to proc eed to transplant. Your diagnosis and health history will guide what tests ar e ordered. The test results will be submitted to your insurance company for a pproval of the transp lant procedure. You can expect the following appoin tments during the second step: Begin Donor search Third Step Initial Consultation Continue Search for Donor Disease Status Evaluation Organ Function Evaluation First Step Second Step Consultations IV Catheter placed Final tests Admit for Transplant Secure a Caregiver Plan 23 A Clinic Appointment: The transplant doctor and nurse coor dinator will meet with you to discus s your transplant options. You will receive documents called informed consents that review the recommended treatment regimens for you. The nurse coordinator will conduct an educational overview of tran splant during this visit. Assessment of Disease Status: If you have a history of leukemia or cancer involving the bone marrow, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy procedure will be done. In addition, a sp inal tap (lumbar puncture) may be done, depending on your disease type. Other testing that may be scheduled includes: MRI, PFT, Echocardiogram, MUGA Scan, Blood CT scan, and PET/CT Scan. Consult Appointments: in one or more specialty areas or clinics, as needed: Cardiology, Dentistry, Radiation Oncology, Ophthalmology and Gynecology. A Social Work Appointment: Along with the social worker, you will discuss your unde rstanding of the transplant process and anticipated recovery period, and how you may co pe during this time. The social worker will talk to you about suppor t and coping resources that you may have or need to identify, resources that your caregive rs may require, financial information, referrals fo r lodging, and other needs. This appointment may be done over the phone or in person. Securing a Caregiver Plan: A successful transplant requires commitment not only from the pati ent and medical team, bu t from the patient's support system as well. Each alloge neic transplant patient requires a 24minimum of 1 primary caregiver and 1 secondary caregiver (a total of two). Pediatric transplant patients wi ll need caregivers with them during hospitalizations and outp atient visits. Being a caregiver for a transplant patient is a vital role in the transplant process. Ag reeing to fill this role is a serious commitment. Along with this book you will receive a folder of forms that need to be returned to the transplant team. One of these form s is called the Caregiver Responsibilities Agreement. This form outlines the responsibilities your caregivers will face and each caregiver will need to review and sign this form. The tr ansplant team will need a completed form that reflects your caregiver plan before you are admitted for transplant. Securing a reliable caregiver plan can be challenging for many patients and families. Family members and friends often work and/or have other responsibilities. Often, a \"caregiver plan\" consists of a number of people who are available to assist at various times and with specific duties/needs. Being a caregiver does not require medical experience. Examples of potential caregiver option s that other patients/families have utilized can be found in the RESOURCES section of this handbook on page 81. Remember, a single option may not provide an adequate caregiver plan; combining a number of the option s will often fulfill the need for a reliable caregiver plan. 25 The Donor Search Process continues throughout this second step. The Third Step will be scheduled within the month prior to your admission for the transplant. Final testing will be done during this period. You will have a final pre-transplant consult with your doctor and transplant coordinator. Research protocols that you may be eligible for are often discussed at this time. You can expect the following appointments: Catheter Placement: all patients undergoing an allogeneic transplant require a special IV catheter (examp le - Neostar, Hickman or Broviac catheters) to be present (or placed) for the transplant. These are used to administer IV fluids, antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs, transfusions, blood tests, and other medi cations during the transplant . If you have a catheter in place, you may require another on e for transplant. Catheters are often placed at the time of admission for tr ansplant or during the week prior to admission. You will have an appointment with the Skills Lab nurse educators who will teach you what you n eed to know to take care of your catheter. 26Pre-Transplant Issues for ALL Transplant Patients Time Commitment in Pre-Transplant Phase We recognize that your time is valuable and you have other commitments. We ask that you are as flexible as possible in scheduling appointments during this time. We will make every effort to accommodate your needs. Keep in mind: 1. Consult appointments in other clinics generally require a minimum of three hours. Each clin ic has different hours and different scheduling requirements. We will make every a ttempt to schedule the appointment on the date and time you want, but it may not be possible. 2. Appointments vary in length of time. 3. Some laboratory or infusion appointments may be scheduled at an off- site or satellite clinic of the University of Michig an such as the East Ann Arbor, Domino Farms, Canton, or Bria rwood Health Care Facilities. Fertility Counseling / Sperm Banking: It is important to speak to your doctor about the possibility of infertility prior to your transplant, since the chemotherapy or radiation therapy you re ceive with transplant will likely lead to infertility or sterility. Sperm bank ing is a consideration for some men, although previous treatment may have already caused sterility. Fertility options for women and girls are limited. Discuss your options with your transplant doctor, nurse, or social worker. Dental Exam The mouth and teeth can be a source of infection. Before coming for your transplant you should have all necessary dental work done, including teeth cleaning, X-rays and routine exam. If ma jor dental work needs to be done, your dentist should call the transplant nurse coordinator at (734) 936-5719. A 27summary of your dental health will be needed prior to your transplant admission. Nutrition Prior to the transplant, it is important to maintain your nutritional intake by eating a well-balanced diet adequate in calories and protein. No food restrictions are needed unless you have a health problem that requires a special diet. Eating a variety of foods is recommended to get the nutrients you need. If you are experiencing eating problems, contact the transpla nt dietitian for help. Exercise You should remain active. Walking can be a good way to build your strength and increase your circulation. Rememb er not to overdo -this can be more harmful than no activity at all. You shou ld not be in pain du ring or after your exercise. If you have ques tions related to your curre nt nutrition or exercise level, call the transplant office and speak with the dietit ian or your nurse coordinator. Smoking If you smoke any substance, you must quit immediatel y. This is necessary to prevent lung infections and lung damage , which may be increased by smoking. Make every effort to avoid second-hand sm oke, as this is also harmful to your lungs. Talk to your doctor or nurse co ordinator if you need assistance quitting or a referral to the smoking cessation program available at UMHS. Remember, you are not allowed to smoke in the hospital or on hospital property. Transportation The city's bus system, AATA has several stops outside the he alth system. Bus maps and schedules are available in the lo bby of the Cancer Center. Some local hotels offer shuttle service to and from the health system. UM Patient & Visitor 28Accommodations can direct you to these by callin g 1-800-544-8684. The Guest Assistance Program Office on Level 2 of University Hospital can help address your transportation needs. They ca n also be reached by phone at 1-800-888-9825. The American Cancer Soci ety offers a transportation program called Road to Recovery; they ca n be reached at 1-800-227-2345. Prescription Payments, Parking Passes, Meal Tickets and Tangible Assistance Many pharmaceutical companies offe r lower cost or free prescription medications to patients wh o meet financial requiremen ts through Prescription Payment Assistance Programs. The UM Guest Assistance Program (GAP) can help determine your eligibility for pres cription payment assistance programs and other assistance programs such as discounted parking passes, transportation assistance, and inpatient meal tickets. Note that patients must meet criteria for these se rvices; they are availabl e to those who meet these eligibility criteria. The GAP is located on level 2 of University Hospital and can be reached at 1-800--888-9825. Healthcare Durable Power of Attorney and Living Will A Durable Power of Attorney (DPOA) is a document that designates the person you trust to make medical decisions on yo ur behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. It is usually part of an advanc ed directive or a Living Will. A blank DPOA is included in the forms folder of this packet. Review it, discuss your decisions with your family and support network and co mplete this form during the pre-transplant period. Bring a copy of the completed form with you to the transplant admission and give a copy to a family or support system designee. Insurance Understanding the costs and insurance benefits for tran splant services can be difficult. The health system can provid e you with the information you need to plan effectively for meetin g the costs of the transpla nt services. Use this 29information as a reference guide to dire ct you to resources within the health system if problems regarding your insurance or medical bills arise. Prior to transplant, a University of Mi chigan Patient Accoun ts representative will contact your insurance provider and confirm your insurance prior authorization requirements for payment of transplant services during the inpatient stay. After the Patient A ccounts representative has gathered this information, you will receive two copies of your transplant insurance confirmation. Carefully read the information provided. Sign th e \"Guarantee of Account\" section of the form and return-one copy to the UM Patient Accounts Department as soon as possible. Questions to ask your insurance company: Are treatment-related lo dging and/or transporta tion costs covered? Will I be assigned a case ma nager? Is one available? Do I have prescription coverage? Questions to ask your pr escription insurer: Can I fill prescriptions at the Univ ersity of Michigan pharmacy? What are my prescription co-pays? Do I have a yearly limit (sometim es called a cap) on prescription coverage? Ask for a formulary list from your prescription provider. This will include the medications covered by your prescription provider. Ask if the medications used after transplant are covered an d, if so, what is the co-pay fee? We have included a li st of the medicati ons commonly used during and after transplant in the RE SOURCES section of this handbook. This list can be used to confirm covera ge with your prescr iption provider. 30Lodging If you are receiving an allogeneic transp lant and live more than 1 \u00bd hours from the University of Michigan, you will likely need to live in the Ann Arbor area for at least two months after di scharge from the hospital. Patients receiving an autologous transplant may often have short-term (1-2 weeks) needs for lodging in the Ann Arbor area after transplant. These requirements change depending on your medical n eeds. Your transplant doctor will determine your lodgin g needs and the length of time you will need to stay in the Ann Arbor area. Explore your options and financial abilit y to arrange lodging for you and your caregiver(s) in this pre-transplant period . Securing a pl an for lodging after transplant is the responsibi lity of you and your suppo rt person and should be completed before the transplant admission; you will not be able to make formal reservations until you are hospitalized and ready for discharge or until your family or support person is ready to move in. UM Patient & Visitor Accommodations (P VA) can locate lodging options that meet your needs. A vari ety of housing options are available to you and your family in the Ann Arbor area. We have co mpiled a list of housing options to get you started; however, this list is not exhaustive and may change. It can be found in the RESOURCES sect ion of this handbook. You are welcome to explore other options and the Pati ent and Visitor Accommodations (PVA) can assist you at 800-544-8684. Lodging expenses are rarely covered by medical insurance plans. Medicaid may pay a portion of lodging expenses, the GAP or your transplant social worker can provide you with more details. 31Fundraising Fundraising activities can help support lodging and other tran splant expenses. Many people find it helpful to partne r with friends or family members in fundraising efforts. We have included a letter in the RESOURCES Section of this handbook to use for fundraising and fi nancial assistance efforts. Several community organizations help transplant patients and famili es raise funds. They are included in the Community Assistance Organizations list located in the RESOURCES section of this handbook. If you have examined every option to find payment for lodging, and still are unable to find a way to pay, contact your social worker to discuss. Emotional Concerns Your social worker is available to help you identify and cope with the stress of the transplant experience. It is important to focus on the strengths that you and your support system have. Talk ab out your concerns and feelings with your social worker or those close to you. Our staff will en courage you to develop your physical, social, emotional and spiritual strengths. Although each family's emotional response to the transplant process is unique, many share similar reactions. You and your family are likely to experience some or all of the following feelings: stress, fear , anger, and guilt. The first few weeks in the hospital can be difficult. You may be dealing with the stress of living in a new area, adjust ing to the hospital routine, coping with 32a loss of control over your situatio n, and becoming comfortable with the inpatient health care team. You will be learning ma ny new details about your treatment and the amount of information can be over whelming. If you have questions or don't understand what has been said, ask for clarification. This will relieve some of the stress you will be experiencing. Fear can be an overwhelming emotion th at patients and fa milies experience before, during and even after the tran splant procedure. These fears often include fear for the well being of your fa mily, fear of discom fort, fear of what your future holds and fear of dying. Although a transplant unit is a place of hope, it is important to realize that patients can die during the course of transplantation. Sometimes family me mbers and patients may not talk about their fears of death as way of trying to protect one another, but these fears are very real and sharing them with family and staff often helps. Anger is another common reaction to illn ess. Some patients may be angry at a higher power; others direct their anger at their family or the health care team. Loved ones may feel angry at the patient for being si ck and disrupting their lives. Although anger is a normal reacti on to stress, it is important to find a healthy outlet (for exampl e, talking to someone) to relieve the tension. Many families also talk about feeling gu ilty. Parents may f eel guilty because their child has cancer. Adult patients may feel guilty fo r being a burden to their loved ones. Caregivers may feel guilty for feeling angry or frustrated about their lives being disr upted or may feel he lpless that they ar e unable to do more for the patient. These feelings are perfectl y normal human emotions an d coping with them may be difficult. You and your loved ones should not hesi tate to use the experience, understanding and support of the transplant team an d unit staff to help you 33deal with these emotions. Many patients find support groups help ful in coping with the emotions and stress of transplant. A group is held weekly on the adult transplant unit for patients and their families. There are also local support groups, telephone and online groups that you ca n find at the UM Patient Education Resource Center located on level B1 of the Cancer Center. CarePages: Setting up a Communication Plan The pre-transplant time is a good time to develop a communication plan for family, friends and your support network. One op tion for your plan is CarePages that offers free, private web si tes and patient blogs. The University of Michigan Health System has partnered with CarePages to make it easier for you and your family to communicate. You will find a link to the CarePages private site as well as instructions for using the program at www.mcancer.org/patients . All you need is an e-ma il address to register and get started. Planning What to Pack Being in the hospital can be difficult. Th ere are ways to make this a little easier by bringing items from home. The item s and ideas listed below are offered as suggestions. There are many items and amenities provid ed at no charge to you on the transplant units. Remember, your transplant room size is limited. 34The transplant team encourages you to bring personal items to make the hospital room feel more at home. Items from home can also provide distraction and ofte n help decrease stress and boredom. Many patients have found it difficult to read or concentrate during the hospitalization. It is often best to bring a variety of ac tivities to occupy your time. Check with your nurse coordinator or social worker if you have questions about items not on this list. Items everyone should bring: One copy of your Medical Durable Power of Attorney and Living Will Your completed Caregiver Re sponsibilities Agreement This handbook Items to consider bringing: Pajamas, sweats, or loos e fitting, comfortable street clothing to change daily (Tops that open in the front ar e preferable to pullovers; need loose collars for chest central lines. Short sleeve shirts for central lines in the arm (PICC lines) Bathrobe that opens down the front Clean underwear to change daily Slippers with non-skid bottoms Shoes to- walk the halls/ride exercise, bikes Hangers for the closet Turbans, scarves, or hats (in case your feel chilly after losing your hair) Pillows, blankets, and stuffed animal s may be brought in, however they 35should be machine washed before bringing into the room. They must be sanitary. Avoid feather pillows. New items do not need to be washed before bringing into the room Electric razors only Toothbrush toothpaste/toothbrush holder Nail file or emery board Make-up in new, unopened containe rs only (keep to a minimum) Menstrual pads (we only stock very large bulky ones, no tampons) Yoga pad for exercises Night light Silk plants/flowers Favorite posters, family photos Personal address/telephone book Prepaid telephone calling cards Cellular phones are allowed. Howeve r, regulations prohibit use within one foot of a medical device A journal, stationary, stamps and envelopes (consider pre-addressing them) Videotapes/DVD's Leisure activities such as puzzles, b ooks, magazines, crafts; audio books, and a container to keep th em in when not is use Walkman/Small radio/CD player with CD s / IPOD (Bring a storage case to keep them secure in your room when not is use) Answering machine Laptops can be used on the unit. 1-2 days quantity of single servin g food items may be brought in and stored in the unit refrigerator(snacks, frozen foods, popsicles, soda) 36Items not to bring: Valuables Tight restrictive clothing Disposable razors Finger nail-clippers Artificial nails Contacts Multiple dose eye drops Dental Floss Tampons Cologne/ perfume /body spray /lotion with fragrance Refrigerators or other small appliances Fans Live plants and flowers All sources of standing water are prohibited on the unit; this includes humidifiers, vases of water with flowers, etc. 37Transplant This section will review the transplant process and details of your anticipated hospitalization. It describes different ty pes of transplants, so everything may not apply to you. The Transplant Hospitalization Once the pre-admission testing is comp leted and you are ready for transplant, you are admitted to the transp lant unit at the Children's and Women's Hospital. These units specialize in the care of bone marrow/blood stem cell transplant patients. Your Hospital Room All patients receiving a transplant will be placed in a private room. A special air-filtering device called a hepafilter is built into each room. Each room includes a bedside stand with small drawers; a small closet; a television with access to a VCR/DVD and a telephone. Videos, DVD's and numerous games are available at no charge. Each of the patient rooms is equipped with the \"Get We ll Network\". This is a 38new patient education, entertainment and interactive patient care tool system that will keep you and your family engaged and informed throughout your stay. Family Facilities A lounge is located on the transplant un it for family and visitor's use. The lounge has a large kitchen and eating area and is equipped with clothes washers and dryers for family use. Internet-accessible computer and relaxation areas are available as well. Visiting Guidelines Visiting hours are flexible for patients in private room s. We encourage families and caregivers to use this time to get th eir own much needed rest. Number of visitors should be limited to 2 at one time. Lodging arrangements for visitors are available through the Patient and Visitor Accommodation s program. The nursing and medical st aff may change visiting hours if patient care warrants it or the patient's condition changes. Overnight Stays One adult family member or caregiver is allowed to stay overnight in the patient room. Overnight gues ts may use the shower in the patient's room by coordinating this with the nurse. Fa mily caregivers may have meal trays delivered to the room for a small fee that will be added to the hospital bill. Contact the unit clerk or the dietary ai de to make these arrangements. Sick Siblings, family members or visitors All visitors must wash their hands when entering and leaving a patient room. Because this is a transplant unit where pa tients are at risk when exposed to any illness, we ask that visitors and family me mbers wait to visit until they are well. During flu season (or other epidemics) the rules for visitors often change. Visit 39www.med.umichy.edu/flu for details on cu rrent restrictions. Visitors <14yrs old To protect patients, all visitors regardle ss of age are required to undergo an infection control screening at the Wel come and Badging Stations at any entrance of the Children's and Women's Ho spital. Children found to be ill are not allowed on the transplant unit. In general, childr en may visit if they are healthy and have not been exposed to co ntagious diseases (such as chickenpox, measles, colds or flu) within the previous 48 hours. It is recommended to take their temperature prior to visiting. Visitor Check-in and Ba dging at Mott Hospital All visitors to C.S. Mott Hospital are required to wear a visitor's badge to maintain a safe and secure environment. A health screen will be completed at the Welcome and Badging station. Thes e are located at each entrance to the hospital. The greeters provide visitor badges. Telephone Service There is no charge for local calls usin g the patient telephones. Long-distance calls must be made collect or billed to a credit card. Standard telephone jacks are used in all rooms and personal phones, answering machines or fax machines may be used. Patient Mail While you are in the ho spital, you can receive mail at the following address. It is important to include your exact room number and hospital unit in the mailing address to ensure the mail gets to you. Also, write the word \"patient\" in the lower left-hand corner to facilitate quick delivery of your letter or card. 40 P a t i e n t N a m e Children's and Women's Hospital B o n e M a r r o w T r a n s p l a n t U n i t Patient Unit 7 C&W / Room # ____________ 1540 E Hospital Drive Dr. Ann Arbor, MI 48109 CarePages Access and update your Ca rePages using the room computers. Family members have access to computers in the Family Lounge or in the Fa mily Center on the main level of Children's and Women's Hospital. Plants/Flowers As a transplant patient, you will be susc eptible to infections until your white blood cell count returns to normal. Du ring this time, fresh-cut flowers and plants are not permitted because they may carry a large nu mber of germs in their water and soil. Fres h fruit baskets also are no t permitted. Artificial flowers and cards are welcome. Internet Access While you are a patient or vi sitor at UMHS facilities, you can access the Internet using the \"Get Well Network\" in your room . Access is also available over our free wireless (WiFi) guest network using your own laptop or Internet-capable mobile device (including \"smartphones\"). Meals Your meals will be served to you in your room by dietary staff. There will be some restrictions in your diet while you are hospitalized in order to reduce the chance for infection. Food from home is permitted and ther e are refrigerators to use for storage, however, ask your dietitian or nurse about the other 41guidelines, restrictions, and nutrition options. Bringing Food to Transplant Patients Transplant patients are on a special diet throughout the transplant admission. Transplant patients may ea t food brought in from the outside if the following guidelines are met: Food Preparation Guidelines: Always wash your hands and a surface the food will touch before handling food. If you are handling raw meat you must wash your hands after handling the meat and before touching another food substance. If a plate, cutting board, or utensil was used for pre-cooked food, do not use again for cooked food. Use separate cutting boards for meats and vegetables. Do not thaw food at room temperatur e. Thaw frozen foods appropriately as follows: a. In the refrigerator OR b. In the microwave on the defrost setting OR c. By running cold water continuously over meat until thawed Cook foods thoroughly. Fresh vegeta bles must be cooked; do not eat them raw. Fruits with a thick peel (such as oranges, bananas) or those that can be eaten once peeled (such as apples) are allowed to be eaten fresh. Canned and cooked fruit sauc es are allowed. Meats should be cooked until well done. Seasoning (ex. pepper, herbs, and spic es) may be added PR IOR to cooking. Only salt may be added AFTER cooking. Portion food into individual servings in tightly sealed co ntainers and cool in the refrigerator or freezer prior to transporting to the hospital. 42 Do not leave food in a large cooking po t or let it cool on the counter, this leaves food in the \"danger zone\" te mperature of 40 to 140 degrees which is prime temperature for bacteria to grow. Food from a Restaurant or Grocery Store: If purchasing food from a restaura nt or the cafeteria, follow these guidelines: Check \"sell by\" and \"use by\" dates and do not buy out of date items Do not buy damaged, bulging, or deeply dented cans Make sure that frozen foods feel so lid and refrigerated foods are cold Store groceries promptly after shopping Do not buy bulk foods from self-service bins Avoid lunch meats from a delicate ssen. Prepackaged ham and turkey slices are OK. Avoid bologna, salami, olive loaf. Avoid cold deli salads, sa lad bars or smorgasbords. Avoid fountain pop/soda, milkshakes, frosties, frozen yogurt or soft serve ice cream from bu lk serving machines. Avoid unpasteurized and gently past eurized honey, cider or juices Avoid unpasteurized milk or dairy pr oducts. Pasteurize d milk and dairy products, including yogurt, are acceptable. Avoid aged cheeses or cheeses with molds (bri e, Camembert, bleu, Roquefort, stilton, gorgonzo la, feta, farmer's cheese). Avoid raw nuts. Roasted nuts without shells are acceptable (i.e. roasted peanuts) Avoid raw or undercooked meats, poultry, fish and shellfish. Well- cooked meats, poultry, fish and shellfish are acceptable. Avoid selecting an item that has been held in a food warmer. Request that the item be freshly prepared. 43 Request the item be prep ared without condiments (i.e. ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and tarter sa uce). Ask for individual packages instead. Request that sandwiches be prepared without lettuce, tomatoes and raw onions. Bakery items with cream and custard fi llings as well as baked custard, are only allowed if they have been refrig erated, or are fresh out of the oven. Shelf stable bakery items (Twinkies) are allowed. Transporting Food to the Unit: Transport refrigerated or frozen food items in a cooler with ice. If food is brought freshly made fr om home or from a restaurant and transportation time is LESS than 10 minut es, no cooler or ice is necessary. If transportation will take LONGER than 10 minutes, the food should be thoroughly cooled in the refrigerator or frozen an d then placed on ice in a cooler for transport to the unit. Food Storage and Preparation ON the Unit: Food should be placed in the BMT refrigerator and labeled with the patient's last na me and the date. Food should be re-hea ted in the microwave until hot (steaming) and promptly eaten. The Medical Center Smoking Policy The University of Michigan Medical Ce nter has a no smoking policy for the entire Medical Cent er. Smoking is not allowed in buildings or parking structures. 44The Transplant Process Conditioning Conditioning refers to the chemothera py and/or radiation therapy that are given at the start of the tr ansplant admission. This conditioning phase can take one to 10 days and is typically complete d a day or two before the infusion of the stem cell product. The purpose of cond itioning is to give high enough doses of chemotherapy and/ or radiation to eliminate canc erous cells that are present, to make room for the new stem cells, an d to suppress your immune system. This is done to prevent rejection of the new donor cells. Conditioning: Chemotherapy The chemotherapy you receive has been very carefully planned as part of a \"protocol,\" a precisely timed and organize d approach to the treatment of your disease. The protocol outlines the medi cations you need, as well as blood tests, X-rays and other procedures. The protocol was written by a doctor who is an expert in the field of cancer and transp lant. Before your admission you will be asked to sign an informed consent that reviews your treatment protocol. This document assures that you have been given important information, including the risks and benefits about your tr eatment and the transplant process. The chemotherapy is an important part of the protocol and will consist of one or more different types of medications, depending on the type of disease you have and the type of transplant you are receiving. The chemotherapy is given on a 45special schedule that is thought to be best for killing your cancer cells (if present). You will be told exactly what days you wi ll receive chemotherapy and how you should expect to feel. These medications will be given to you intravenously (IV) or in a tablet or capsule form to be taken by mouth. The doses of chemotherapy used in a transplant are often much higher than those you may have received be fore. To kill cancer cells in your body it is often necessary to use the high est doses possible. Beca use of this there is a possibility that you may experience more severe and different side effects than the ones you may have had in the past. Chemotherapy may kill cells other than cancer cells. It can damage normal, fast-growing cells such as those in your mouth, throat, bowe ls, skin, hair and bone marrow. You may experience mo uth or throat sores, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, a rash or change in the color of your skin, and a loss of hair. It also will cause your blood counts to become very low. You will be given medications to minimi ze the nausea and vomiting. Pain medications are available if you develop sores in your mouth or throat. Good oral hygiene including freq uent mouth-care is requ ired of all transplant patients to help limit the number of mouth or throat sores. A nurse will help you develop a mouth-care plan. If you de velop diarrhea or co nstipation, we will use medications to correct the problem. It is very likely that you will lose your hair during the treatment. If you lose your hair, you may wear a cap, scarf, wi g or turban. Body heat is lost through the head, so you may feel co lder after you lose your hair. In most cases, the hair loss is temporary and should grow back within a few months. Chemotherapy may also affect organs of the body such as the kidneys, liver, heart and lungs. Although severe side effects are infrequent, they can progress and cause more serious problems. It is impossible to predict who will 46experience these side effects. You will be given information to explain each chemotherapeutic medication, how it wo rks and the potential side effects. Reduced Intensity Conditioning: In some cases, your doctors may elect to give you a less intensive or \"reduced inte nsity\" conditioning regimen. Reduced intensity transplants are typically perfor med either for older patients, or for those patients who are note d to have abnormal orga n function (such as the heart, liver, lungs or ki dney) prior to th e transplant. In such cases, the transplant doctor may not feel that your body can tolerate the full dose of chemotherapy that may normally be give n to patients with transplant. In a reduced intensity transplant, chemotherapy is given to suppress your immune system, thereby allowing the new stem cells to take hold and start growing. As the chemotherapy is less intensive, th e complications you may experience in the first 2-4 weeks after tran splant, such as mouth sore s, infections, kidney or liver problems, are often much less. However, since a lower dose of chemotherapy is used, reduced intensity transplants do not immediately kill as many cancer cells as full dose transplant s. Thus, patients undergoing reduced intensity transplants often sh ould be in remission (or close to remission) before starting transplant. In some cases, th is may not be possible. Your transplant doctor will tell you if a reduced intensity transplant is possible for you. Radiation Radiation therapy (or irradiation therap y) is a part of some transplant conditioning regimens. There are three ty pes of radiation that can be given to patients: (1) Total body irradiation (TBI ) given to the entire body, (2) Total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) given to ma jor-lymph nodes, or (3) a boost of radiation directed at certain body parts. Radiation is given by a machine that sends rays of high energy into your body. The cells in your body are prevented from growing and multiply ing when they receive th ese high energy rays. 47The type of radiation yo u may receive will be disc ussed with you by your transplant doctor and radiat ion oncology team. If radi ation is planned, you will meet with the radiation-onco logy team before your tr ansplant admission. The team consists of the radi ation-oncology doctor (who is in charge of your radiation treatments), the radiation technologist (who administers the treatments), and the radiation nurse (who will monitor you for side effects). Radiation may be given as an outpatient or (following admission) while you are in the hospital. The radiation is given 1-2 times per day on the B2 level of the hospital. The special machines in this department require the temperature to be cold, therefore, you may want to wear a robe and bring an extra blanket. You should take off all metal (jewelry, safety pins, clips, etc.) before your appointment. The radiation therapy procedure often takes 30 to 60 minutes. During this time you will be asked to re main in a certain position (lying down, standing or sitting). You will be alone in the trea tment room, but the technologist can hear you, talk to you, and s ee you on a video monitor. You will hear the machine making a humming sound while the treatm ent is being given, but you will not feel anything. Radiation may affect both cancer cells an d normal cells. The side effects from radiation are due to its effects on normal cells. Initially, you may experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. You will be given medicati ons to prevent and treat these side effects. After you complete the radiation trea tments you may develop other side effects, such as red, dry skin, which may develop into a suntan look; dry mouth, which occurs from the effect of the radiation on your salivary glands; parotitis 48(swelling of the of your ears); infertility; lung-changes and cataracts (see COMPLICATIONS section for more information). Your doctors and nurses will be monitoring you very cl osely for these side effects. Some of these are easily treated, while others may require long-term follow-up. If you have questions regarding your treatments , ask a member of yo ur transplant or radiation team. Stem Cell Infusion - \"Transplant\" After your conditioning chemothera py, you are ready to receive your transplant. The infusion, or transplant, is done very much like a blood transfusion. If you are receiving st em cells from a donor (an allogeneic transplant), the infusion is given to you soon after the stem cells are collected. The transplant is given through your IV catheter much as other blood transfusions. If you receive your own stem cells (an autologous transplant or from cord blood), a blood bank technologist will bring the fr ozen product to your room for thawing immediately before infusion. You may experience some side effects from DMSO, which is a preservative used to protect the cells during the freezing and thawing process. 49You may notice a garlic-like taste in your mouth that will remain on your breath for two or three days. Your urine may become red-colored for 24 hours. In rare cases, the DMSO can cause other problems, such as shortn ess of breath, wheezing and stomach pains. However, these side effects occur rarely and your nurse and doctor will monitor you closely du ring the transplant. Recovery Within 1-2 weeks after receiving your conditioning therapy, your white blood cell count will decrease and may remain low until the new bone marrow cells begin to grow. During this time, yo u are at great risk for developing an infection, since you will not have white blood cells to fight bacteria, viruses or fungi. If you develop an infection during the time when your blood counts are low, you will be placed on an tibiotics immediately. To help identify an early infection it is important to let your nurse or doctor know how you are feeling. Some of the symptoms of an infection are: fever (over 38\u00b0 C; or 100. 4\u00b0 degrees Fa hrenheit) skin tenderness chills/sweating a burning feeling when urinating rectal pain/tenderness a cough, sore throat or mouth pain loose bowels general feeling of tiredness If these symptoms appear, notify yo ur nurse or doctor immediately. 50You may be given immunoglobulins (antibodies) through your IV. Immunoglobulin infusions ar e a boost of antibodies th at can kill bacteria, fungi or viruses. Infusions of immunoglobulin are a type of transfusion, as the immunmoglobulins (antibodies) have been collected from he althy donors. The transfusion of antibodies lasts several hours and may also be given as an outpatient after you are discharged. Platelets are also made in the bone ma rrow and help preven t bleeding. Your platelet count will be checked often du ring your transplant admission, and you will be watched for sign s of bleeding. Platelet transf usions may be given if your platelet level gets too low or if you show signs of bleeding. It will take several weeks-months for your red blood cells to return to their normal levels after conditioning therapy. During this time you will require red blood cell transfusions to maintain your red blood cell count (hemoglobin). Blood Products / Transfusions: During the recovery period, your body will require support through transfusions of red blood ce lls and platelets. Blood products are provided by the American Red Cross and are coordinated by the UMHS blood bank. It is not possible for your family and friends to supply all your blood product needs. Patient Responsibilities Throughout your recovery process, the most important member of the \"team\" is you. You play an important part in your care and will have many things to do every day. All of thes e are important for your reco very. You know yourself 51best, and your transplant team depends on your reporting and cooperation. Nutrition: Nutrition has a vital role in helping you achieve the best result for your medical treatment. Good nutri tion helps prevent infections from developing and also he lps you maintain a sense of well being. It is often difficult to st ay well-nourished during ch emotherapy. The dietician will help you meet your nutrient re quirements by offering nutrition supplements or by suggesting nutritious foods that you can tolerate. This is very important for your recovery after the transplant. If you are unable to eat, nutrition will be provided through an intr avenous solution. This is called total parenteral nutrition. Another aspect of your nutritional care is a low microbial diet. Its purpose is to decrease the risk of developing an infe ction by avoiding fo ods that may contain bacteria. The diet allows only well-cooked foods and restricts food that may be high in bacteria, such as fresh fruits and vegetables that are unable to be peeled. The dietitian will in struct you on the guidelin es and principles of the diet. Mouth Care: This is an area where you can make a difference. Good oral hygiene will be important to you before , during and after your transplant. Mouth sores and infections can be painful and life threatening. The therapy you receive before your tr ansplant affects the cells lining the inside of your mouth and th roat. As a result, you may develop sores. If your mouth is not kept clean, an infection ca n occur that can quic kly spread to other parts of your body. You wi ll be given medications to help prevent infections if the sores develop. However, the most important part will be keeping your 52mouth clean. You should brush your teeth and tongue at least four times a day. Hygiene: It is necessary for you to take a ba th or shower every day. Your nurse will give you special soap to use that wi ll kill bacteria on your skin. Always remember to wash your hands after us ing the bathroom, after touching sores on your body and before pe rforming your mouth care. Activity : There are many reasons why we stress exercise and phys ical activity. You will feel better mentally and physically, keep your skin, muscles, heart and lungs in shape, and sleep better at ni ght if you follow a regular exercise program. You will work with a physical therapist to develop your personalized exercise program based on your experience, habits, interests and physical condition. An exercise bicycle and treadmill are available for use on th e transplant unit in University Hospital. Walk ing as much as possible in the hallways is also recommended. It is important for you to stay out of bed during the day as much as poss ible. Activities that distract you are a good way to keep busy and decrease boredom. These include games, puzzles, listening to music and other hobbies you may have. If you have questions about an activity , ask your nurse, doctor or physical/occupational therapist. 53 Engraftment Approximately two to four weeks afte r your transplant, your bone marrow should show signs that it is engrafting or starting to grow. This will be evaluated by drawing a sample of your blood. The first sign of this is the production of white blood cells called ne utrophils (ANC). Platelets often take a little longer to begin developing. Once yo u have engrafted and your condition is stable, you will be discharged from the hospital. Discharge Although each person varies in how lo ng he or she takes to recover, the following are general criteria used for discharge from the hospital: Infections or graft versus host disease (GVHD) should be absent, stable or under control. Not requiring daily transfusions (especially platelet transfusions) Able to tolerate oral medi cations, food and fluids Active enough to functi on outside the hospital Discharge teaching has been comp leted for you and your caregiver 54 55Complications There are many potential complications of transplant. The high doses of chemotherapy, prolonged periods of lo w blood counts, and effects from the donor cells themselves can all lead to serious complications. These can occur at a time during or after your transplant. Many of these complications can be treated with medications an d careful monitoring. Some of them, however, can lead to life-threatening situations. Ther e may be a time when you will need to be monitored very closely in an intensive care setting. If this occurs, the transplant team will continue to care for you with the intensive care staff. Remember that all patients are unique and not every patien t will develop these complications. We will watch you cl osely for the following possible complications. In general, we divide potential compli cations into four phases; each phase is separated by an approximat e time point post-tra nsplant. Day 0 is the actual day of transp lant. Diagram #6 illustrates these phases. Diagram #6: Phases of transplant complications Pre-transplant Post-transplant Day 0 Day 10-14 Day 100 Chemotherapy Complications Nausea, vomiting fi iMouth sores Diarrhea Transfusions Fevers / Infections Kidney problems Liver (VOD) Nutritional issues Electrolytes issues Pneumonia Acute GVHD Infections Engraftment Fevers / infections Kidney problems Liver (VOD) Electrolyte issues Pneumonia (IPS) Chronic GVHD Infections Endocrine issues Sterility Growth Secondary cancers 56 Diagram 6 serves only as a general refe rence for you. It provides a general overview of common transplant complications, and when they are likely to occur following transplant. It is not me ant to be all inclusive. Likewise, the diagram does not mean that you will de velop each of these complications, or that the complications (if developed) will always be severe. Some complications, such as GVHD (graft vers us host disease) ty pically do not occur in autologous transplants. On the other hand, patients who receive a transplant from a partially matched donor are more likely to develop graft versus host disease. Your doctor will review the common complications that you may experience with transplant, based upon your particular transplant type, the intensity of the chemotherapy you receiv e with the transplant and the degree of match you have with your donor. This diagram can simply serve as a guide or reference to help discuss your particular risks. Infections During and after your transplant, you will be at risk for developing many different types of infections. Immediatel y after your transpla nt you are at risk for bacterial and fungal infe ctions, as well as for reactivation of certain viruses that reside in your body (for example, the chicken pox or herp es simplex virus). Even the slightest infection can become life threatening. You will receive a number of preventative antibiotics duri ng the transplant. These antibiotics are intended to lower the risks for developing certain viral, bacterial or fungal infections during the process. During the first several months after yo ur transplant you wi ll continue to be susceptible to infections, especially viral infections. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus that may cause severe infections of the lungs, gastrointestinal tract or liver, Special medications are required to treat CMV. Pregnant women should 57avoid contact with pati ents who have an acti ve CMV infection. Your immune system may remain weak ened for approximately one year (or more) following your transplant . Although you can return to an active life, it is important for you to be slightly more ca utious and report lingering illness to your transplant team. A co mmon event for patients is to experience shingles (herpes zoster), a reactivation of the ch icken pox virus, in the year following transplant. Approximately 1 year after tr ansplant you will n eed to have all of your childhood vaccinations repeated. Veno-Occlusive Disease (VOD) This is a complication that typically affects the liver. It is caused by the high doses of chemotherapy that may be us ed during the transplant. When VOD occurs, it becomes very difficult for the liver and subsequently lungs and kidneys to function norm ally. The signs and symp toms of VOD may include jaundice (yellow skin and eyes), a swollen and tender belly (especially where your liver is located), an d weight gain. Treatment for VOD may include various medications, blood transfus ions, careful monitoring of your liver and kidney function, and blood tests. If veno-o cclusive disease occurs, you may be transferred to an intensive-care unit for monitoring. In some cases, your lungs may require extra support to breathe, re quiring the use of a machine called a ventilator or breathing machine. In ot her cases, your kidneys may require the support from a dialysis machine to re move extra fluid from your body. Lung and Heart Complications Pneumonias are common following tran splant. Approximately 30-40% of patients undergoing an allogeneic transp lant and approximately 25% of patients undergoing an autologous transplant will develop pneumonia at some point during their transplant course. The pneumonia may be severe, even life threatening in some cases. Not all pn eumonias are caused by infections. Approximately 50% of all pneumonias fo llowing transplant are non-infectious 58in origin, related either to (1) the effect s of graft versus host disease (GVHD) in the lungs or (2) direct damage to the lungs from the chemotherapy given just prior to transplant. A condition called Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome (IPS) is a particularly dangerous condition that may occur in the lungs following a transplant. It is most likely to occur in patients who receive a transplant from a mismatched donor. However, it can o ccur in any type of transplant. Typical signs and symptoms of IPS include shortn ess of breath, cough, and the need for oxygen support. There are special medica tions that may be required to treat IPS. In addition, many pa tients require a breathin g machine to help them breathe when they have IPS. A test called a bronchosco py is often performed to tell if you have an infectio n in your lungs. A bronchos copy is a special tube (a type of periscope) that is passed into your lungs to see how they look. Lung fluid can be collected duri ng the bronchoscopy proced ure, and then tested to determine if an infection is present or not. Other tests, including Chest X rays and CT scans are often done to moni tor the appearance of the lungs. Since lung problems are common with tr ansplant, you will typically have tests done before, during and after your transp lant to monitor the condition of your lungs. Heart and blood pressure problems ar e also common during transplant, especially in individuals who already ha ve a history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol or triglyceride levels, blood clots, heart attacks, strokes or blocked arteries. In addition , patients with a history of diabetes are at higher risk for developing blood cl ots or heart problems duri ng transplant. Such heart problems may include high blood pressure, irregular heart beat / arrhythmias, heart failure, or even heart attacks. Tests (blood tests, echocardiogram or MUGA test) will be done prior to transp lant to help determ ine your risk for developing such problems during transplant. 59 Bleeding Bleeding after transplant is common, especially when your platelet levels are very low. Platelet transfusions are give n to try to prevent severe bleeding. Your platelet count and signs of bleeding wi ll be monitored ofte n by your medical team during your transplant. Blood in the urine (called hematuria) is also common after certain types of transplant, and is often due to a specific virus that infects your bladder. Your doctors will monitor you for such complications and treat you with specific antibiotics, if required. Graft Versus Host Disease: (GVHD) Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a complication that occurs when the new stem cells (the graft) react against your body (the host). It can range from a very mild complication, or may progress to a life-threatening on e. It is common in allogeneic transplants and rarely occurs in autologous transplants. There are two general form s of GVHD: acute GVHD and chronic GVHD. When does GVHD typically occur? Acute GVHD typically occurs within the first 100 days after transplant. Chronic GVHD typically occurs following day 100 po st-transplant. This is not a hard and fast rule. There are cases in whic h acute GVHD starts after day 100, and cases in which chronic GVHD starts before day 100 post-transplant. What does Acute GVHD look like? As above, the \"acute\" type of GVHD ty pically begins within the first 100 days after transplant. It may pres ent as a skin rash on all or part of your body. The rash associated with GVHD is red, but generally no t painful or cause severe itching. The rash often starts on the cheeks, ears, upper neck, shoulders, palms and soles of the feet. The rash can spread to the entire body surface. GVHD can also involve the intestines (causi ng diarrhea) and th e liver (causing 60jaundice). GVHD of the intestines is ty pically associated with a crampy belly pain plus watery diarrhea. The diarrhea is often desc ribed as watery green, but it may be yellow or brown in color also. The belly pain may be severe and require pain medications to help control the painful cramps. What does Chronic GVHD look like? Chronic GVHD can develop three to 12 mo nths after transplant. Sometimes it occurs after a patient has already had th e acute type of GVHD. In other cases, chronic GVHD may occur on its own, without a preceding history of acute GVHD. This type of GVHD commonly affect s the skin, liver and intestinal tract, and can cause dryness of the eyes and mouth. The skin rash associated with chronic GVHD is different th an the rash seen with acute GVHD. With chronic GVHD, th e skin may develop an eczema type appearance, may become dark (or very light) in appearance, or may develop a tightness (called scleroderma). The lungs can also be affected by chroni c GVHD, with scar ti ssue forming in the lungs. If this were to happen, your lung capacity woul d decrease and you would become short of breath more ea sily with exertion. You would be at greater risk for developing pneumonia if the chronic GVHD involved your lungs. Special tests call Pulmonary Function Te sts (PFT's) will be done at specified intervals after an allogeneic transplant to monitor for GVHD of the lung. It is VERY important that you do not skip these PFT tests. Chronic GVHD may cause significant drynes s of the eyes and mo uth. It is very important that patients undergoing a llogeneic transplants take eye drops prescribed during transplant and see an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) on a regular schedule. Your transplant team will help yo u schedule these appointments with an ophthalmologist. Your transplant coordinator will 61schedule an appointment for you to see an ophthalmologist at the University of Michigan prior to your transplant ad mission. Routine follow-up appointments with an ophthalmologist after tr ansplant will be necessary. Finally, it is not uncommon for chronic GVHD to cause significant dryness to the vaginal area in females. Thus, for females 16 years in age or older, your transplant coordinator wi ll schedule an appointmen t for you in the Ob-Gyn (Obstetrics and Gynecology) clinic at the University of Michigan, prior to transplant. Follow up appo intments with the Ob-Gyn service after transplant will be required. How are acute or chronic GVHD diagnosed? The diagnosis of acute GVHD is based upon symptoms such as skin rash, crampy diarrhea, and yellow jaundice. If the diagnosis is in question, then biopsies of affected areas are often perf ormed. For example, skin biopsies are commonly done on rashes to determine if GVHD is present. Likewise, biopsies of the stomach or intestinal tissue are often done by a pr ocedure called an endoscopy or colono scopy to make the GVHD diagnosis. The diagnosis of chronic GVHD is likewise done by exam of the skin, eyes, mouth, and lungs. Likewise, tests such as PFT's (see above) are routinely performed to monitor for chronic GV HD of the lungs. Like acute GVHD, biopsies of tissue (skin, mouth, intest ines) are often requir ed to confirm the diagnosis of chronic GVHD. How often do patients ge t acute or chronic GVHD? Patients who undergo transplant from a fully matched sibling donor typically have a 33% chance of developing some form of acute GVHD after transplant. Patients who receive transp lant from an unrelated donor may have a 50-60% chance of developing acute GVHD afte r transplant. If there is a mismatch 62between the patient and dono r, then the chances for de veloping GVHD are even higher. The chances of developing chronic GV HD depend upon several factors, including your donor source (sibling) or unrelated donor, and the type of process used to collect the stem cells (stem cell harvest or a bone marrow harvest). Patients who undergo transpla nt from a matched sibling donor have a lower chance of getting chronic GVHD th an patients receiving transplant from an unrelated donor. In a ddition, patients receiving bone marrow from donors have a lower chance of getting chronic GVHD than patients rece iving stem cells. For many transplants, the chances of developing chronic GVHD may range from 40-50% after transplant. Your transplant doctor will discuss with you your risks of developing chronic GVHD , based upon your type of transplant (bone marrow or stem cell), and how well matc hed your donor is to you. How do we treat GVHD? If you are undergoing an allogeneic transplant you will receive several medications to prevent severe GVHD from occurring. It is essential that you take all of these me dications when they are schedule d. Prevention is the best way to fight GVHD. Typically, some of the GVHD medicati ons (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) may be started even prior to the stem cell infusion, so that your body can start fighting GVHD as soon as the new stem cell s are infused. In addition, the University of Michigan has historically pa rticipated in a number of clinical research studies designed to lessen the severity of GVHD. Your transplant doctor will tell you if you may be eligible for these clinical research studies. What is ECP and how do es it treat GVH? ECP refers to \"Extra-Corpore al Photopheresis. The letters (E-C-P) stand for the following: 63 Extra refers to doing a pr ocedure outside the body, Corporeal refers to the body or in this case, to blood cells, and Photopheresis refers to light therapy. If you put all those definitions together , ECP means light ther apy that is given to blood cells that are re moved from the body. Do ctors use ECP to treat or prevent acute or chronic graf t versus host disease. Each ECP treatment session typically lasts 2-3 hours, and is given at specified weekly or monthly intervals. You ar e awake during ECP therapy, and the therapy is usually not painful. During the ECP therapy, about 6 to 8 ounces of blood are removed from your body thro ugh and IV. The IV takes the blood into a special machine where it is exposed to ultraviolet light. This exposure to ultraviolet light kills certain types of blood cells. The goal of ECP is to kill the GVH causin g cells and return the good blood cells back to you. ECP therapy is done at the bedside if you are an inpatient, or done in the ECP clinic if you are an outpatient. Your doctors may talk to you about ECP if you develop GVHD. How long does GVHD last? Unfortunately, we cannot an swer this question. Every patient is different. Some cases may last several weeks, others se veral months, whereas others may last for several years. Does GVHD serve a useful purpose? GVHD may not only attack ce rtain sites in your body (skin, liver, intestines) but may also attack cancer cells that remain in your body afte r transplant. Thus, patients who develop GVHD often have lo wer rates of relapse of their cancer, than patients who do not de velop GVHD after transplant. We call this a \"graft 64versus leukemia\" (GVL) effect. Lack of Engraftment There is a possibility that the new stem ce lls will fail to deve lop or mature after the transplant. If this occurs, it is calle d rejection or non-engr aftment. For the majority of transplants, the risk of re jecting the new bone marrow or stem cells is < 10%. There are various reasons why your body may reject the bone marrow or stem cells from a donor, in cluding development of some of the complications listed above. There are medications (s uch as Neupogen\u00ae) that can be given to help stimulate the new bone marrow or stem cells to grow in your body. These medications ar e usually given by inject ion each day for several days until your blood counts begin to recover. If yo ur blood counts fail to recover following a transplant, your do ctors will talk wi th you about the potential need to perform a 2nd transplant. Relapse and Secondary Malignancies Unfortunately, transplant does not guarantee that yo u will be cured of your cancer or underlying disease. Even with transplant, your disease could still return or relapse. In a small number of patients, a diffe rent type of canc er can occur after transplant. Such secondary cancers may be caused from (a) the chemotherapy or radiation given prior to transplant, or (b) associated with graft versus host disease occurring after transplant. Such secondary cancers ma y include skin or mouth cancer, or other types of leukemia . In general, the risks of developing secondary cancers are approximately 10% fo llowing many transplants. If this occurs, you and your doct or will discuss available treatment options. 65 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) There may be a time during the transp lant procedure when your condition becomes more serious. At this time yo u may require closer monitoring and will be transferred to the ICU. This is an intensive care unit with nurses and doctors who are trained and experience d in caring for patients requiring intensive and specialized tr eatment. The bone marro w transplant team works very closely with the staff of the ICU an d will continue to follow your care after your transfer. There are different visiting hours and family guidelines than those on the transplant unit. The staff of the ICU will meet with your fami ly to review these soon after your transfer. 66 67Post Transplant Discharge Planning The transplant procedure is very intens ive and will continue to affect you and your activities for some ti me. The following instructions are very important to follow. There is no special time when all restri ctions and precautions can be stopped. This will vary for each patien t. You should follo w these gu idelines for a minimum of 100 days foll owing transplant, possibly lo nger in some cases. In general, allogeneic transplant pati ents will be followed in the transplant clinic one to two times a week immediat ely after discharge. The frequency of future appointments will depend up on how you are doing. Autologous transplant patients will be seen appr oximately twice after discharge before returning to the care of their referring doctor. It is important to return to the clinic for appointments after transplant. In the beginning, your appointments will be quite frequent; they will become less frequent as you recover, regain your stre ngth and are less likely to experience severe complications. Do no t hesitate to contact the clin ic or your doctor if you think you should be seen between scheduled appoin tments. Even after you return to your doctor in your community , we are available to you by phone or appointment. The transplant team is always available to assist you with your discharge plan and care after transplant. This sectio n of the handbook will answer many of the questions you have abou t this phase of transplant. If you have further questions, call the tr ansplant clinic. 68Precautions and Restrictions Many of these precautions and restrictio ns are necessary to prevent infections and bleeding. Your bone ma rrow needs time to mature before it is considered fully recovered. Until that time, there are things you should watch for and help prevent. These restrict ions will lessen over time, as your bone marrow and immune system become fully functioning. Your immune system may remain weak fo r an extended time period following your transplant. In autologous transpla nts, it often takes 3-6 months before the immune system fully recovers. In allo geneic transplants, it can take one or more years to fully recover. Although yo u can return to an active life, it is important for you to be slightly more ca utious and report a lingering illness to your transplant team. Masks You should continue to wear a mask wh en you come to the hospital for your visit due to the construction around th e hospital. A mask will not protect you from someone who is sick, but rather acts as a reminder for you and those around you to be cautious. This is th e reason you are asked to avoid crowds and public places when you are first discharged. A ma sk is not necessary when you are at home or out for a walk. People Avoid close contact with anyone who is ill. Avoid crowded areas, especially during cold and flu season. Stay away from anyone exposed to communicable and/or childhood disease; even if you have already had them yourself, you are still at risk. Pets and Animals Household pets can remain in the ho me, with the exception of birds and 69reptiles. Avoid all contact with birds or reptiles and their droppings; they carry many infections. Avoid contacting anim al waste. Do not kiss or hug your animals and do not let them sleep with you. Do not co me in close contact with outdoor or farm animals. Plants and Flowers These can remain in the home. Avoid ga rdening, mowing the lawn and other activities that stir up so il or the ground. Avoid hand ling fresh-cut flowers in vases; the water can carry large amounts of bacteria. Travel Notify your doctor before you travel. In general you should avoid swimming in lakes, public pools and sitti ng in hot tubs due to the possibility of exposure to excessive bacteria. Your sk in will be very sensitive to the sun; therefore you should not plan a vacation that will re quire prolonged exposure to sunlight. You may be surprised at the time it takes to regain your pre-transplant stamina, and it may be wise not to plan an ex tended vacation until you see how your recovery progresses. Miscellaneous In general, it is important for you to avoid infection or items that might carry infections. Stay away from dusty, dirt y, moldy things (con struction, areas, remodeling areas, vacuum cleaner bags, etc.) stagnant water (flower vases; vaporizers, de-humidifiers, etc.) and th ings that might ir ritate your lungs (aerosol spray cans, smoke fi lled areas). If you questi on the appropriateness of an activity, it is probably safer to avoi d it until you can clarify it with your doctor. Sexual Activity The stress of illness, transplant and hospitalization may ca use changes in sex 70drive. Sexual activity ca n be resumed, although some precautions may be needed when you are fi rst discharged. Women sh ould use a water-based lubricant to combat vaginal dryness (w hich results because of chemotherapy and radiation). Discuss concerns you have about intimacy at the time of discharge or during your re covery from transplant. Physical Activity It is essential to maintain the activity program outlined in the hospital by your physical therapist. There is a potential for developing infections in your lungs after the transplant, and remaining acti ve helps keep your lungs stronger. Activity outdoors, such as walking, is good for you. Remember to avoid construction areas or anywhere dirt or soil is being moved, as this increases your risk of developing a fungal infect ion in your lungs or sinuses. You may tire easily at first. This is normal after returning home. Try to build your endurance slowly; space out ac tivities, do lighter tasks at first, schedule rest periods into your day's activities. Avoid exhaustion and fatigu e. Listen to your body. It could be up to a year before your full stamina returns. Activating the Caregiver Plan Now is the time you will acti vate your caregiver plan. Your caregiver will begin to take responsibility for: daily monitoring of your medical status, medication scheduling, driving and accompanying you to clinic appointments, your meal preparations, maintaining a clean living environment, shopping and other activi ties of daily living. Other family members and friends are ofte n willing and ready to help. Now is the time to let them! 71Children It is important to notify your child's school that you must be notified of communicable diseases like measles, chic ken pox, etc. No tify your doctor immediately if your child is exposed to one of these illnesses. It is advisable that toddlers and preschool -age children not attend day care or preschool in order to decrease your chances of exposure to infection and disease. Notify your child's doctor that you will be having (or had) a blood or marrow stem cell transplant. It is important th at you avoid contact with children who have received a live immunization (such as the chicken pox vaccine). If children are living in the home and vaccinations are necessary, inactivated vaccines are acceptable and may be administered. Driving You will not be able to drive for at least three months following your transplant. This period may be shorter for patients receiving their own stem cells. Physical stamina is generally redu ced and could lead to a decrease in the reflex time necessary for safe driving. Also, you may be taking medications that would make it unsafe to operate an automobile. It is important that you consider this as you make plans for your follow-up care. It is essential to have someone available to drive yo u to your clinic appointments or to the hospital if you should need ur gent medical care. Returning to Work or School Your return to work or school will depend on the type of transplant you receive and how your recovery proc eeds. For the first 100 days after your transplant you will not return to work or school (these are examples of public places referred to earlier). Patients receivin g autologous transplants can expect to return to work on a part-time basis so metime after 100 days. Patients receiving an allogeneic transplant should not expect to return to work or school for up to a year. Although this is a general rule, remember that every patient is different 72and decisions are made by your doctor based on your physical condition and the work or school environment. Reimmunizations Since your immune system is so intensel y affected by the transplant, it may no longer \"remember\" its previous exposures to childhood vaccinations. Therefore, you will be reimmunized with several of your \"baby shots\" one to two years after transplant. This will be discussed with you at your one-year post-transplant return visit. Arrangemen ts can be made to have the vaccines given by your personal, or family doctor. After your transplant you will not be able to receive a flu vaccine for a minimum of 6 months after transplant. Bu t, it is very im portant that your family members and people that you ar e in close contact with receive the vaccine. Diet Loss of taste and appetite happens freque ntly following transplant. If you are having problems eating a diet adequate in calories and prot ein, talk with our dietitian. After a transplant, eating a well balanced diet is important to help regain your strength and rebuild the normal tissues affected by chemotherapy. All patients are encouraged to practice good food sa fety guidelines. Autologous transplant patients do not have to follow a sp ecial diet after transplant. Following an allogeneic tran splant, you may initially need to follow a \"strict low bacteria\" diet often called a modified microbial diet or a neutropenic diet. Until your immune system is strong enough (app roximately 100 days after transplant), it will be necessary to follow the general guidelines listed below. 73 General Food Guidelines after Transplant: 1. Use common sense in dealing with food. Check expiration dates on perishable food. Check for mold or in sect contamination. Do not keep leftovers longer then two days. Discard questionable items. 2. Foods should be held at proper temperature. Cold foods such as milk and dairy products, should be kept in the refrigerator. Hot foods should be kept hot, not served at room temperature. Portion food into individual servings in a tightly sealed container and cool in the refr igerator or freezer. Thaw frozen foods appropriatel y either in the refrigerator, microwave on defrost, or by runni ng cold water continuously over meal until thawed. Do not thaw food at room temperature. 3. Avoid deli lunch meat or chee ses that are not pre-packaged. 4. Avoid smorgasbords and salad bars. 5. Discard leftovers after two days. 6. Well water should be proc essed through a filter or tested by the health department. 7. Fruits and vegetables must be washed thoroughly. Cut off bruised areas. Do not eat fresh strawberries, fresh raspberries, raw broccoli, raw cauliflower or sprouts. In general, it is best to avoid uncooked fruits or vegetables that cannot be peeled befo re eating. Frozen or canned berries are okay. 8. Avoid rare and medium-rare meats. 749. Avoid deli salads not prepared in the home. 10. Do not share eating or drinking utensils. 11. Avoid juices, honey and dairy products that are unpasteur ized or gently pasteurized. 12. Until your appetite returns to normal, a daily multi-vitamin/mineral supplement is recommended. It is not necessary to take large doses of vitamins and minera ls, as this may be dangerous as well as expensive. Select a simple, inexpensive, daily multi vitamin without iron, unless advised by your doctor. Notify your doctor if you develop difficulties eati ng, swallowing or tolerating food. Hygiene Routine daily hygiene will continue to be important at home. Remember, frequent hand washing is your best prot ection against infection. The following are specific guidelines for daily care that will help prevent infections and assist your body in its recovery. Monitor these areas closely and notify your doctor if you notice changes or have concerns: Mouth care: Continue the mouth care regimen that you practiced in the hospital. Continue your mouth care afte r meals and at bedtime . If you notice bleeding or if your platelet count is lo w, use a soft-bristle toothbrush (run hot water over your toothbrush). Notify your doctor if you notice sores, tenderness or other changes in your mouth or throat. Notify your doctor of plans for dental work. You should have a dental follow-up visit at six months after transplant. Skin care: Continue good daily hygiene using a mild soap. You may notice your skin is drier than normal. If you use moisturizi ng lotions or creams they 75should not contain alcohol or perfumes. Your skin will be extremely sensitive to the sun. Always wear a hat and s unscreen with a minimal Sun Protective Factor (SPF) of 30. Remember to wear a sunscreen on exposed areas, whenever you are outdoors (even if it's not sunny). Rectal care: This area will continue to be very sensitive and will require special attention. Keep this ar ea very clean, cleanse af ter every bowel movement. Notify your doctor if yo u notice pain or tenderne ss when you have a bowel movement or other changes in this area . Do not use suppositories or enemas unless advised by your doctor. Venous access devices: Continue to care for your venous access device and the dressing around or over it as you were instructed in the ho spital. Observe the area around the catheter during dres sing changes for redness, tenderness, drainage or changes in appearance. No tify your doctor if changes occur. Cuts/bruises: Cleanse all cuts and scratches carefully with a mild soap and water. Keep them covered with a bandage until healed and notify your doctor if the area becomes reddened, tender, sore, develops drainage, or if you develop a fever. Increased bruising ma y indicate a decrease in your platelet count. If you notice bruises beginning to develop for no apparent reason, notify your doctor. Outpatient Transfusions Until your bone marrow is fully recovered, you may need to receive red blood cell and/or platelet transfusions on an outpatient basis. After receiving a transplant you should receive only irradiated blood products. Fever/chills or hives/itching are re latively common reactions to blood transfusions and may occu r with the transfusion of blood products. These symptoms usually occur during or shortly after transfusio n. On rare occasions, 76these symptoms may be noted seve ral hours after the transfusion. You will be given post-transfusion instructions regarding the signs and symptoms of a transfusion reaction. No tify your doctor im mediately if these signs or symptoms occur following your transfusion. When to Notify your Doctor The following are general rules for notifyin g your doctor. If you are unsure of symptoms or have concerns about something, call yo ur doctor. The transplant team remains available to you after your discharge for medical assistance or to answer questions. Call them at (734)936-9814. Notify your doctor for the following : Fever (over 38\u00b0 C; or 100. 4\u00b0 degrees Fa hrenheit) New cough, shortness of breath Persistent headaches Blurred or double vision Bleeding (nosebleeds, blood in the stool or urine, vomiting blood, increased bruising or other bleeding) Pain during urination or bowel movements Reddened. swollen or painful areas New developments of diarrhea, constipation or vomiting Difficulty swallowing or development of mouth sores Changes in your venous access device or the area around it Fever/chill or hives/Itching following a blood transfusion 77 Medications Prescribed medications You probably will be discharged on se veral prescription me dications. It is common to be discharged with suppleme nts, such as potassium or magnesium that you will need for several days to a few weeks. Medicati ons for nausea and vomiting may be needed until your a ppetite returns and you resume regular eating habits. You may also need to take oral antibiotics to prevent or treat infection. If you receive an alloge neic transplant, you will take an immunosuppressive (such as steroids, Ta crolimus, Cyclosporin, Mycophenolate) for six months or longer if you de velop graft versus host disease. It is advisable to use only one pharmacy at home. They will have your complete records, can advise you on your prescriptions and wi ll communicate with your doctor. You may ask your pharmacy to deliver your medications or have a member of your family pick them up. Pharmacies (like hospitals) often are places where you may be exposed to infections. \"Over The Counter\" Medications Colds/Flu: You are susceptible to colds and flu for several months after discharge. At the first sign of the illness you sh ould call your doctor. If he or she suggests that you take an over- the-counter medication you should select a product with no aspirin. Aspi rin can alter platelet function, which may cause bleeding. Products that contain acetaminophen or ibuprofen can mask a fever and should also be avoided unless discussed fi rst with your doctor or clinic nurse. Be sure to read the labels of all your medi cations or ask your pharmacist or doctor to suggest a product that does no t contain aspirin. Products containing 78antihistamines and/or nasal decongestants are best to use for colds or flu. Do not use non-sedating antihistamines (S eldane, Hismanal) without talking to your doctor. Several medi cations taken afte r transplant may interact with these. Avoid decongestant nasal sprays. These can be very irritating to the nasal tissues. Nasal sprays of this type are very short-acting an d can do more harm than good. A persistent cold or flu could be a sign that you may have a si nus or lung infection that requires an antibiotic. If your symptoms pe rsist for more than four days, contact your doct or promptly. If you are feeling ill, remember to take your temperature frequently (sever al times a day and whenever you-feel warm). Notify your doctor immediately if your temperature is above normal. Pain: Minor aches and pains are normal af ter discharge. If your pain becomes worse or persists you should discuss it wi th your doctor. Pain may be a sign of infection. If you need pain medication, choose on e that does not contain aspirin or ibuprofen. Aspirin and ibuprofen products can alter your plat elet function, you may be at a higher risk for bleeding. You may take acetaminophen (Tylenol) fo r minor aches and pa ins if approved by your doctor. Acetaminophen can mask a fever and should be avoided unless discussed with your doctor or clinic nurse first. Ma ny cold and flu products contain acetaminophen. Read your labels carefully. Stomach Distress: Chemotherapy can ca use damage to the mucosa of the mouth, esophagus, stomach and intestines that may take a few days to several 79weeks to completely heal. It is common for the nausea and vomiting to persist for some time after the transplant. You may need medication at home for nausea. Over-the-counter antacids ca n be quite effective in relieving the discomfort, but they should be used ca utiously, especially if you are taking other oral medications. Because antacids \"coat the stomach\" they can prevent some medications from being absorbed. Therefore, they should be taken at least two hours before or after other medications. If you have specific questions about drug interactions wi th antacids and me dications you are taking, discuss them with your pharmacist, doctor or nurse. Antacids that contain al uminum may cause constipa tion. If you are having problems with diarrhea, this would be a good product to choose because it may help counteract the diarrhea. Antacids that contain calcium or a co mbination of aluminum and magnesium may be less likely to cause either diarrh ea or constipation. Examples of these are Maalox, Mylanta or Tums. Milk of magnesia is an an tacid that contains magnesiu m. It may cause diarrhea and should be avoided. Liquid antacids usually are more effective and should be used if possible. Diarrhea: Diarrhea is often a proble m during hospitalization and may not resolve totally until you return home and resume your normal activities. There are products available over the counter that you may use at home that are effective for mild diarrhea. Diarrhea (if new onset), or persistent di arrhea can be a sign of an infection, graft versus host disease or other proble ms. If you have severe diarrhea or 80diarrhea that does not subside, you should contact your doctor. Constipation: Constipation is unusual after transplant but may occur in some patients. If it does oc cur it may be managed by increasing your physical activity or altering your food and fluid intake. If medication is recommended by your doctor, use a stool softener such as docusate (Colace or Surfak). Stool softeners do not act immediately and may ta ke as long as three days to work. Drinking lots of fluids wi ll help the stool softener work. Do not use rectal suppositories or enemas beca use they can cause rectal irritation and bleeding. Laxatives (Ex-Lax, Co rrectal, Dulcolax, Feen-a-mint) work by stimulating the intestine. Products like these should be avoided be cause they are very short acting and may be dangerous. 81Resources Glossary Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) also called \"absolut e granulocyte count\" \u2014 amount of white blood cells present in the blood that ar e able to fight infection.

The donor can be given general anesthesia so he or she is not awake and won't feel anything during the procedure. Once in the operating room, the donor is positioned on their stomach. The doct ors place needles into the hip bone (pelvis) and pull out the ma rrow with syringes. The n eedles are placed through the skin three to five times over each hi p bone. For each time the needle goes through the skin there are many puncture s into the bone. Once collected, the marrow is filtered and placed into blood ba gs. If an autologous transplant is to be done, the marrow is processed and stored frozen until later. If the marrow is donated for an allogeneic transplant, it is brought to the patient for transfusion soon after the harvesting is completed. When the ma rrow is donated from an unrelated donor, it is collected where th e donor lives and brought by courier to the patient within ho urs of collection. The entire harvesting procedure takes on e to three hours. The patient/donor may receive a blood transfusion during the collection process to replace the blood removed with the bone marrow. Once completed, the patient/donor is taken to the recovery room with a la rge bandage across the hips that will remain in place for 24 hours. Discharge fr om the hospital is generally the same day. There is soreness from the harves ting, but pain medication is given as needed. Soreness can vary from person to person, but normal ac tivity is usually resumed within three to four days an d complete recovery occurs within approximately two weeks. 88 89FAST FACTS: Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Apheresis Apheresis is performed as an outpatient procedure and usually takes 3-4 hours per procedure. The patients or their donor will have 1 to 4 procedures done to collect the required number of stem cells. For several days prior to the procedure, a drug called Neupogen \u00ae, which is a growth-factor, is taken in injection form to produce a greater number of stem cells, which are released into the blood. Apheresis is done by inserting a needle into one arm and connecting the IV tubing to a machine where the peripheral stem cells are separated and collected. The rema ining blood components (white cells, red cells and platelets) are returned to you through another IV in your other arm. The only discomfort yo u may feel is when the IV needles are inserted. In some cases, an IV catheter is inserted in the chest, neck or groin if the veins in the arms are not large enough or strong enough for the procedure. You will need to report to the blood bank early in the morning for your apheresis procedure. If you are traveling a great distance, arra ngements can be made for lodging by calling the bone marrow tr ansplant social worker or Patien t & Visitor Accommodation Program. Someone should accompany you to this appointment in case you need to be driven home. 90 Before your apheresis: Eat a normal breakfast Drink a full 8-oz. glass of milk: you need the calcium for the procedure Take the prescription me dication you usually take, unless you were told otherwise. (Notify the blood bank tech nologist of all me dication taken) Do not take aspirin or other over -the-counter medications unless approved by a transplant doctor. (You may take Tylenol or Tylenol-Extra Strength) Empty your bladder You should not lift anything heavy for several hours after apheresis to allow the needle sites to heal. Location: The apheresis procedure is performed in the UMHS Transfusion & Apheresis Services room. This is located on level 8 of the Chil dren's and Women's Hospital Questions? If you have questions regarding your appointment, contact the Transfusion & Apheresis Services Prog ram at (734) 936-6900. 91FAST utilized pre-transplant) PROTONIX / PANTOPRAZOLE If your insurance does not cover this, one of the following may be substituted: PRILOSEC / OMEPRAZOLE (most frequently utilized pre-transplant) Names in italics are the generic drug names 92 AMLODIPINE OXYCOTIN OR OXY IR/ OXYCODONE PROTONIX / PANTOPRAZOLE If your insurance does not cover this, one of the following may be substituted: PRILOSEC Caregiver Plan Securing a reliable caregiver plan is challenging for most patients and families, as family members and friends work and have other responsibilities. Often, a caregiver plan consists of a number of people who are available to assist at various times and with spec ific duties/needs. Below ar e examples of potential caregiver options that other pati ents/families have utilized. A single option listed below may not be an adequate plan in itself, however combining a number of the options will of ten fulfill the need for a reliable caregiver plan. Caregiver Options Include: o A family member who utilizes FMLA time off from work o A retired friend or family member wh o is available during the week when a spouse or significan t other is at work o A friend or family member who works part-time and is available to assist on their days off o A friend or family member who is av ailable to reside with patient at home or in Ann Arbor for a specific period of time (i.e. 2 weeks when they are in town on vacation, a mo nth in the summer when off work, during a leave from work) o A friend or family member who is available weekda ys, evenings, or weekends only - in conjunction wi th other friends/family who are Caregivers do NOT need to have medical experience or training 94available to cover the other times o Private duty aides or caregivers avai lable for an hourly fee (average $18- 20/hour through various agencies). Pati ents either privately pay or have family/friends fundraise to pay fo r such services. The services are arranged by patients/families directly, and are rarely paid for by insurance companies. o A friend or family member who is able to drive patient to clinic appointments partnering with anot her friend/family member who does not drive and is available to assist with home needs. o A friend of a friend, co-worker, or family member of a friend o Member(s) of a religious or community organization th at the patient, family and/or friends are involved Develop a Caregiving Calendar: Many patients/families find it helpful to utilize a blank calendar and to pencil in dates/times wh en caregivers are available, knowing dates and times can change according to patient recovery needs. Have A Back-Up Plan for Emergencies: For patient safety, it is imperative to always have a back-up caregiver availabl e should a primary caregiver become ill for a short period of time (i.e. with a cold or the flu). Pediatric Patients : We recommend a plan that iden tifies a caregi ver who will stay with pediatric pa tients during all hospitalizations and be present during all outpatient visits. 95Community Assistance Organizations The following information may help pa tients and families experiencing financial stress, as well as when seek ing information or support regarding a diagnosis or transplant issue.

Employment 1. Am I eligible for paid time off fr om my job? If so, for how long? If eligible, you would likely firs t exhaust any unused sick and/or vacation time. Your employ er's Human Resource (HR) representative will be able to provide this information; along with how long your position will be he ld and what pay rate you will be offered while receiving both short and/or long term disability. If you are paid only a portion of your income, you may want to consider applying for Social Security Disability (see Social Security section). 2. What if I am ineligible for paid time off from my job (i.e. self- employed)? You may be eligible to apply for So cial Security Disability and/or Medicaid (see corresponding sections for detail). 3. When can I return to work? Most autologous transpla nt patients are able to return to work 100 days after transplant. Most allogeneic (donor) transplant patients are able to return to work 1 year after transplant. Spea k to your BMT doctor should you have specific concerns regarding above time frames. Depending on your recovery and the type of work you will be returning to, you may be eligible to discuss options of returning on a part-time basis or to work from home sooner. 113Disability 1. Am I eligible for short-term and/ or long-term disability through my employer? Your employer's Human Resource (H R) representative will be able to provide this information; along with how long your position will be held and what pay rate you wi ll be offered while receiving both short and/or long term disability . You will also want to inquire regarding health insurance coverage options while collecting short and/or long-term disability. 2. Should I apply for Social Security Disability (SSD)? Please see \"Social Security\" section for information. Social Security 1. Should I apply for Social Security Disability (SSD) / Supplemental Security Income (SSI)? If you are undergoing an allogene ic transplant, you will meet 12 month disability criteria for SSD /SSI. The choice of if/when to apply is a personal decision base d on whether or not you are in need of the income. For example, if your employer is maintaining your full income, or mo st of it, you may want to defer applying for SSD/SSI, which offers approximat ely 60-65% of your regular income. If you are undergoing an autologous transplant, whether or not you meet 12 month disability criteria for SSD/SSI will depend on your disease process and anticipate d recovery. As a result, the application process can include a 5-month waiting period, which can further be discussed wi th a SSA representative. 2. How do I go about initiating the so cial security application process? By contacting the Social Security Administration (SSA) on-line at 114www.ssa.gov , calling 800-772-1213, or by visiting your local SSA office. Your social security representative will eventually require medical documentation from UMHS , at which time you can make the request at a clinic visit with BMT medica l staff. Please note: Information will likely be unavailab le the day of request so you will want to provide advance notice. 3. If I am approved for SSD, will I lose my medical insurance? No, SSD is income - completely separate from insurance. 4. Is it true that I may be eligible fo r Medicare prior to the age of 65 if I am on SSD? See Medicare section for detail. Caregiver Needs 1. Will I need a full-time caregiver? Autologous transplant patients - yes, for a minimum of 30 days post-transplant. Beyond that will be determined by your transplant doctor based on your medical status. Allogeneic (donor) transplant pati ents - yes, for a minimum of 100 days post-transplant. Beyond th at will be determined by your transplant doctor based on your medical status. 2. Does my caregiver need medical experience? Most caregivers do not have me dical experience. Patients and caregivers will be provided a br ief training by one of the BMT nurses at the time of hospital discharge. 3. If my caregiver is required to be wi th me 24/7, does that mean he/she is unable to take breaks? Absolutely not. In fact, we enco urage breaks for self-care. That said, we ask that no patient recoveri ng from an alloge neic stem cell transplant is left alone for longer than a 4 hour block of time due to infection and other risks. 1154. Why am I required to have at least 2 caregivers? Just as it is important for our pa tient's to maintain self-care, we require the same of caregivers. By having one or more back-up caregiver(s), the primary person is allowed respite. Also, a back-up is necessary if the primary caregiver becomes ill. Lodging 1. Will I be able to return home after transplant? If you are having an autologous transplant, barring any unexpected complications, you will be able to return home immediately following your hospital discharge. If you are having an allogeneic (donor) transplant and live within 1.5 hours of UMHS, barring any unexpected complications, you wi ll be able to return home immediately following your hospital discharge. If you are having an allogeneic (d onor) transplant AND reside more than 1.5 hours from UMHS, you will be required to secure temporary lodging within 1 hour of UMHS for a minimum of 100 days post-transplant (approximatel y 2 months after your hospital discharge). 2. How do I go about finding Ann Arbor lodging? Patients/families are able to stay wherever they are comfortable, as long as the residence meets post-tra nsplant criteria (i.e. within an hour of UMHS, free of new construction or renovations, etc.). Social work has included lists of \"Ext ended Stay Hotels\" and \"Local Apartments\" in this booklet for yo ur reference. These are locations that other transplant pa tients/families have st ayed. All are within a short distance of UMHS and offe r flexible leasing options (i.e. month to month, flexibility of occupa ncy dates, etc.). If you wish to 116secure other options, you may cons ider talking with family/friends that live in the Ann Arbor area - or know of someone who does, church groups who may o ffer a host house, etc. 3. How will I afford lodgin g expenses in addition to my regular living expenses? Potential options are listed below: o Medicaid - pays $41.25/day toward lodging expenses when patient is present (approximately $1,200/mo nth). Contact social work to fill out necessary paperwork to make the request. o National Marrow Donor Progra m (NMDP) - once you have undergone an UNRELATED donor tr ansplant, your social worker can apply for potential financial assistance of $200-$400 for up to 6 months. o Fundraising - encourage family/frien ds to plan a spaghetti or fish dinner at work/church/a hall, take up a money collection, or hold a car wash/raffle/auction/ golf-outing/bowl-a-thon to raise monies to be utilized toward temporary lodging expenses. o Private Insurance - chec k with your insurance representative to see if you are eligible for a lodging/food stipend. o BMT Social Work - Social Work is sometimes able to provide gift funds for a lodging stipend, based on individual financial need and depending on availabi lity of donations. Insurance 1. How do I know if my transplant is covered by my medical insurance? The BMT billing and insurance specia list will contact you if there are issues with coverage prior to medical staff movi ng forward with your transplant care. However, if you have transplant specific coverage questions, you may cont act her directly at 734-936-7804. If your questions are not tran splant specific , contact your 117insurance company at the number on the back of your insurance card. 2. What potential options do I have if I lose my medical insurance? o COBRA - health plan sponsored by employers with 20 or more employees for a temporary exte nsion of health coverage o Medicaid - a state funded insura nce program for individuals who meet specific income/asset and disability criteria o Medicare - a federally funded insurance program for individuals who meet specific disability/dis ease and/or age requirements o Purchasing a private plan - privat ely paying for an individual vs. group plan COBRA 1. In what instance would I elect COBRA? To maintain the insurance covera ge you once had through your employer, continuing at a group ra te, by paying the full monthly premium amount. 2. How would I know about my eligib ility and the associated costs? Speak to your employer Human Resource (HR) representative for details. Medicare 1. Is it true I may be eligible for Medica re prior to the age of 65 if I am on Social Security Disability (SSD)? Yes, SSD recipients under the age of 65 years become eligible for Medicare after 24 months of re ceiving SSD payments. You will receive a letter from the Social Se curity Administration to notify you of your upcoming Medicare eligibility. 1182. Where can I go for assistance with choosing a Medicare Part D plan? Utilizing your current list of medications, you can contact 800-803- 7174 and speak with a representative for assistance or visit www.medicare.gov . When selecting a plan, please keep in mind it is more important to find a plan th at covers your most expensive medications vs. one that covers th e most medication s (i.e. choosing a plan that covers Cellcept, a co stly medication, even though it does not cover Acyclovir, often a very affordable medication). IMPORTANT NOTE: if you choose to opt out of enrolling in a Part D plan once you become eligible , you will be charged a higher premium when you do en roll (a penalty of 1% of the national premium average for each month you are eligible for coverage, i.e. approximately $32/month additional). The only exception is if you have \"creditable\" (as good as or better than Medicare) coverage at the time you were eligible to enro ll. Please contact Medicare with further questions at nu mber/website above. Medicaid 1. Should I apply for Medicaid? If you are anticipated to be disa bled/unable to work any job for a 12 month duration (as are ALL allogeneic/donor transplant patients) AND you have $2K or less (single individu al) or $3K or less (married) in all liquid assets (checking, savings, IRA's, etc.) you may qualify for Medicaid assistance. If you are not anticipated to be disabled/unable to work any jo b for 12-month duration, you can contact your county Department of Human Services (DHS) office to inquire regarding other potential options for coverage (i.e. for those who have minor children unde r the age of 18 residing in the home). 1192. Where do I apply for Medicaid? At your local Department of Human Services (DHS) office, on-line at www.michigan.gov , or via an application obtained from the UMHS Guest Assistance Program (G AP) office (800-888-9825). 3. How long will my Medicaid application take to process? Applications can take up to 90 days to process, however if approved will offer retroactive co verage for 90 days prior to the date the application was submitted. 4. If I am approved for Medicaid, will I lose my private and/or Medicare insurance? No, your private and/or Medicare policy coverage will remain and Medicaid will act as secondary co verage for the costs not covered by your primary insurance(s). 5. If I am approved for Medicaid, will I also be approved for cash and/or food assistance? Not necessarily. If you are newl y applying for Medicaid, you can include such requests in your init ial application. If you are already a Medicaid recipient, you will need to contact your DHS worker to inquire regarding eligibility. 6. Will I be denied Medica id based on my monthly income even if I meet all other criteria? Not necessarily. You may qualify for Medicaid after meeting an assigned deductible each month. The DHS caseworker determines such eligibility and calculates the deductible amount. 7. What is covered by Medicaid? If you do have a primary insura nce, Medicaid will cover most medical and prescription charge s not covered by your primary insurance. If you do not have a primary insurance, Medicaid will cover most medical and prescription charges. 1208. What if I am uninsured and denied Medicaid? You may be eligible for M-Support through UMHS. Please contact Linda Zywicki, Cancer Center fina ncial counselor, to be screened for eligibility at 734-647-5120. Prescriptions 1. What if I do not have prescription coverage? Patients with limited or no prescription coverage may apply for potential assistance through various drug companies. Please contact the UMHS Guest Assistan ce Program (GAP) office for assistance at 800-888-9825 or visit www.needymeds.com to obtain applications. 2. Are there any resources available to assist with prescription expenses? In addition to the above, patients are sometimes eligible to apply for discount cards and/or re imbursement through community agencies (see \"Community Assistan ce Organizations\" sheet). You may also talk with family/friends regarding fundraising options, and/or speak with your social worker about placing the charges on your hospital bill/setting up a mo nthly/interest-free payment plan. 3. Where can I go for assistance with choosing a Medicare Part D plan? See \"Part D\" under Medicare section. 121 Important Phone Numbers (all numbers are 734 area code) Doctors (Adult Program) Phone # Daniel Couriel, M.D.- Clinical Director Steve Goldstein, M.D- Associate.
