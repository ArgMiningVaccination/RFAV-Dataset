Read on! What Is a Spiritual Bath? Before we start dwelling on the instructions and practical tips on how to take a spiritual bath, let us give a quick explanation of what a spiritual bath actually is. A spiritual bath is a [bath ritual](https://solancha.com/ancient-bath-rituals-attracting-abundance/) that is designed to cleanse your mind and spirit by using powerful ingredients that charge the bathwater with [healing vibrations](https://solancha.com/healing-frequency-list-to-improve-your-meditation/) that help you to remove blockages, [toxic energies](https://solancha.com/emf-protection-crystals-top-10-to-lower-your-electromagnetic-sensitivity/), and stressful situations that are no longer serving you in any constructive way. The spiritual regeneration occurs from soaking in warm water infused by the [powerful essential oils](https://solancha.com/15-powerful-essential-oils-for-money-attraction-success/), [healing herbs](https://solancha.com/top-5-ayurvedic-herbs-for-immunity-and-serenity/), and [crystals](https://solancha.com/crystal-quiz-whats-your-healing-stone/); as well as from setting a clear intention announced in a form of affirmation or mantra. How to Take a Spiritual Bath? Step 1: Preparation Before you start taking a spiritual bath and setting the intentions, you have to make sure that your bathroom is ready for the spiritual ritual. You need to transform your bathroom into a sacred space that resonates with spiritual intentions. Clean and declutter your bathroom and tub. It would be great if you also paid attention to the Feng Shui of your bathroom and reorganize everything according to its principles. Check out our article [7 Feng Shui Bathroom Tips, Taboos, And Cures](https://solancha.com/7-feng-shui-bathroom-tips-taboos-and-cures/) to learn more about it. Clean your tub, straighten your countertops, and make room for the things you want to be surrounded by during your spiritual bath practice. Anything you bring into this practice such as oils, crystals, or candles should be intentionally picked to invoke a sense of your intended energy cleanse. Step 2: Take a Shower Take a quick shower and clean yourself. Step 3: Set Your Intention Decide on the intention of your spiritual bath. The energy you give to this bath is what you will get back. Step 4: Fill the Bathtub and Gather the Ingredients Fill the bathtub with water at a temperature that feels most comfortable. As the tub is filling up, gather all the ingredients you need. You will need the ingredients that will be mixed directly into your bathwater, such as herbs, essential oils, and salts, as well as things that will complement the bath and the atmosphere, such as candles, incense, and crystals. You may want to light incense, [palo santo stick](https://solancha.com/palo-santo-7-amazing-benefits-and-powerful-ways-to-use-it/), [sage](https://solancha.com/an-ultimate-guide-to-sage-incredible-benefits-and-powerful-ways-to-use-it/), or a few candles. Maybe you will want to play some meditative music that will relax your mind into a calm, meditative state. Step 5: Say a Prayer or a Mantra Before you get into the bathtub or as you are stirring in your ingredients, you may want to say a prayer, mantra, or intention aloud. It can be anything you want, as long as it aligns with your general intention for the spiritual bath. Step 6: Bath for 30-40 Minutes Step into the bath and soak for about 20-30 minutes. Try and keep as much of your body submerged as possible. Cup your hands and gently pour the water over your head. As you relax in the water, clear your mind of all negative thoughts and focus on your intention to let go of all stress and negativity. While soaking, you can repeat your intention, mantra, or positive affirmations to charge yourself with positive healing energy. Step 7: Let Your Body Breathe After you get out of the bath, let your body air dry naturally rather than with a towel. This will help your body continue to take in the positive energy. When you are mostly dry, get comfortable and rest for at least 20-30 minutes. You may want to lay down, focus on your [breathing](https://solancha.com/humming-bee-breath-a-simple-technique-for-anxiety-relief/), meditate and just relax. Bath Ingredients There are many different ways you can prepare spiritual baths with different ingredients. You can use just one or two ingredients or opt for even more. It is entirely up to you! Here are some options to choose from: #1: Salts Using natural salts for your spiritual bath will help you to release any kind of [toxic energies](https://solancha.com/cleansing-negative-energy-with-sea-salt-7-simple-methods/), [negative thoughts](https://solancha.com/8-easy-ways-to-stop-negative-internal-dialogue/), and feelings. Pink Himalayan salt, natural sea salt, and Epsom salt are great for this purpose. Use 2-3 good handfuls or less. However, make sure you are not using regular table salts for your baths because they contain anti-caking agents and have gone through a refining process that has removed many of the beneficial minerals. #2: Baking Soda Using baking soda for spiritual baths helps to [purify your aura](https://solancha.com/aura-cleansing-8-simple-ways/) from any negative energies. In addition, soaking in such a bath leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth. Use \u00bc cup-2 cups. #3: Rose Water Boil fresh rose petals until all of the color is out of the petals. Let them cool and add to a warm bath. Feel free to add in some extra petals, fresh or dried, to your bath for extra aroma. Rose water makes an excellent spiritual bath to uplift moods and make you feel more self-love if you've not been taking good care of yourself lately. Throw in some rose petals for good measure and let the fragrance of the bath fill your spirits with loving energy and appreciation of who you are. #4: Lavender For your spiritual bath, you may want to use whole buds boiled in water or pure essential oil. Lavender promotes relaxation by its calming effect on your mental and emotional state. Such a bath is a great stress reliever. Use enough lavender to produce an aroma. #5: Carnations Boil fresh pink and red carnations in a pot of water with honey and coconut milk. Then strain the mixture to keep the liquid as an ingredient for the bath. Taking a bath with such a mixture helps to heal a broken heart and infuse your aura with love vibrations. Here is a list of some more ideas for what you can use in a spiritual bath: Essential Oils: Sandalwood, Palo Santo, Eucalyptus, Patchouli, Lemon, Frankincense, May Chang, Clary Sage. Herbs, flowers, plants: sage, eucalyptus leaf, juniper berries, peppermint leaf, angelica Crystals: smoky quartz, selenite, obsidian, clear quartz, [citrine](https://solancha.com/emf-protection-crystals-top-10-to-lower-your-electromagnetic-sensitivity/).
