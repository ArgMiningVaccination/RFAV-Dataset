There are two components to the program: a detoxification program and a rehabilitation program. Our philosophy integrates 12-step spirituality with the science of addiction medicine. The detox phase of treatment is a comprehensive program providing medical, clinical and spiritual care. The medical treatment plan includes: Identification of predisposing medical and psychiatric problems that may contribute to substance abuse; education of the patient regarding the disease and choices for treatment. To ensure a successful detoxification and rehabilitation for our patients, we utilize evidenced based medication while providing a safe, comfortable detox. Our multi-disciplinary team of chemical dependency professionals includes physicians, nurses, psychiatrists, social workers, counselors and nutritionists who provide support in individual, group and family settings. We are accredited by the Joint Commission and NYS OASAS (Office of Alcohol Substance Abuse Services). The medical treatment plan includes: - Evaluation and treatment of withdrawal symptoms. - Identification of predisposing medical and psychiatric problems that may contribute to substance abuse. - Education of the patient regarding the disease and choices for treatment.
