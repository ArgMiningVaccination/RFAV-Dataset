Effective May 11, 2023, the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine booster mandate will no longer be in effect. Students, faculty, and staff will no longer need to submit proof of vaccination to enter our buildings. Visitor policy: Visitors, including vendors and alumni, will no longer need to show proof of vaccination. The College continues to strongly recommend that everyone continues to follow the CDC [guidelines for COVID-19 vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html). The CDC recommends that everyone be up to date with COVID-19 vaccines including booster doses. The College will continue to offer flu and COVID-19 vaccines on campus during the early part of the Fall Semester. Neither the flu vaccine nor the COVID-19 vaccine will be required by the College, but we encourage you to keep protected with vaccines. Positive COVID-19 tests: Students, Faculty and Staff with a positive test will continue to need to report their results to the [covidreporthr@cooper.edu](mailto:covidreporthr@cooper.edu) to ensure that their Paid Time Off is recorded in ADP as COVID PTO. The College will not be tracking and/or reporting COVID cases. Should anyone test positive for COVID-19, they should follow the CDC guidance after a positive test and consult with their healthcare provider for appropriate care. CDC recommendation for Positive COVID-19 Test Results: If you test positive for COVID-19, stay home for at least 5 days and isolate from others in your home. You are likely most infectious during these first 5 days. The College will continue to allow employees to use COVID-19 Paid Time Off when testing positive for COVID. Should the HERO ACT be revised, we will inform faculty and staff prior to any changes being made as it relates to Paid Time Off. FREE TEST KITS: When the national public health emergency ends on May 11, 2023, COVID-19 tests will no longer be free. We highly suggest that everyone takes advantage of the free test kits that are presently available at local pharmacies so you are prepared should you believe you have been infected and want a free home test kit in the future. PLEASE STAY HOME IF YOU ARE SICK: And as always, should any student, faculty or staff member feel sick either with COVID-19 or any other illness, we urge you to remain home, get care from a medical provider and only return to work when feeling better. Please care for yourself and the Cooper Union Community.
