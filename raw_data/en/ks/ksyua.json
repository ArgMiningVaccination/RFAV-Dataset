An estimated 425,000 people from this group have not yet received a vaccine. Since 21 April, the Netherlands has been vaccinating with the American-Dutch vaccine made by Janssen. Until now, this vaccine has been deployed for smaller groups, such as employees working in hospitals, and patients and employees in mental healthcare. Since the Janssen vaccine is now being delivered in sufficient quantities to vaccinate larger groups of people, the vaccine can also be used by the Municipal Public Health Services (GGDs) from next week on. Giving it to people born in specific years enables us to deploy the vaccines available in the Netherlands as effectively and efficiently as possible. By doing so, we give protection against COVID-19 to as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. The Janssen vaccine is a single dose, requiring only one jab. Two invitations People may receive more than one invitation. People who have already been vaccinated are removed from the invitation lists wherever possible, but this is not possible for everyone, for example if the vaccination data has not (yet) been received by RIVM. People who have already been vaccinated can throw away the additional invitation. Schedule for the vaccination campaign The Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS) determines the order in which groups are vaccinated. The advisory reports of the Health Council of the Netherlands are used as guidance. The start date for vaccination of the various target groups depends on vaccine availability.
