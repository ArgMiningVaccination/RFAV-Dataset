Caffeine, chocolate and mint (toothpaste, gum etc.) should be avoided while using homeopathics...they will neutralize them. - Store remedies at least 3 feet away from anything with an electromagnetic field (anything that plugs in) like a TV, microwave. Never store a homeopathic in the refrigerator. - If you are alcohol sensitive, you may place the drops in 1-2 oz of hot water, wait 15 minutes, as alcohol will evaporate off. Sip the water until finished. - General adult dosage of a homeopathic used for detoxing is 10 drops taken 3x a day. If not using a detox formulation then you could take 10-15 drops up to 6x a day depending on the product and what you are using it for. Always consult with a professional before using with kids. The dosage for kids older than 1 is 1 drop per 10 lbs of weight. Do you have more questions? Contact "}
