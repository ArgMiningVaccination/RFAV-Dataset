Good morning, good evening, good day. I 8hope you all are with me. I was just in the middle of 9a live -- we had about 800 people live with us, 10getting ready to ramp up, and like most of my lives 11that I do now, you get about eight minutes and it gets 12completely shut off. So I bet this happens again. I 13want you all to set your timers. Let's see how long 14it takes before we get shut down this time. You know, 15it's a miracle and a blessing that we still even get a 16chance to come to you all right now in a world where 17ignorance, stupidity, and censorship have really 18collided and combined on a whole different level. 19 So for those of you that don't know me, I'm 20Dr. Eric Nepute, commonly known as the \"Wellness 21Warrior,\" have been for a long time. And I'm just all 22about the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the 23truth. 24 So I wanted to take a couple minutes and 25share with y'all what's really going on. I think aCase: 4:21-cv-00437 Doc. Cut Me Off Again Eric A.

We literally just got shut off again. I 3 just did a video and we hav e full bars, full strength, 4 full power, full everything. We're ready to rock and 5 roll, but we're going to get censored. So I want you 6 guys to share this video, h it that share button. Let 7 me know where you guys are watching from and let's 8 have a conve rsation. 9 I was just talking about, you know, all the 10 deaths and how the deaths were completely -- well, 11 they've been fabricated and they've been pushed and 12 they've been -- you've been lied to. The CDC's 13 numbers clearly come out and say it. You know, it's 14 crazy. 15 Hey, Tina. 16 Anybody -- was anybody on with me earlier, 17 just a couple minutes ago, w henever I got completely 18 shut down? Who was with us a few minutes ago when we 19 did that? 20 It's just embarrassing. It's so sad. 21 People need to wake up a nd realize, you know, what's 22 going on. I had somebody on the first live that we 23 did just a little while ago ask a question of why 24 don't more doctors stand up and tell the truth. Well, 25 they can't. I mean, we're -- we've got literally 6 1 millions of people that fo llow us and we can't get a 2 Facebook live out to save our lives. 3 That's w hy we're telli ng everybody you got 4 to go to our platform and go to freevitamindeals.com, 5 freevitamindeals.com. Go there and register. Sign up 6 for our newsletter and email. We send out one or two 7 emails a day to millions of people with all this 8 information of the truth because we have our own 9 servers and platforms th ere. We don't -- we don't 10 have to -- we don't have to deal with the Communist -- 11 oh, I just said a word that's going to get me 12 censored. Watch, by the way. Somebody tell me how 13 long before it starts freezing and shutting down. 14 But let me just get right into it. So here 15 we go. Hello everybody in Florida. Hello everybody 16 in Wisconsin, Switzerland . Guyana is in the house. 17 We've got -- hello, good morning, New Delhi. How are 18 you in New Delhi? Hope you guys are good. Illinois, 19 I see you there. Michigan, V irginia, Wisconsin. West 20 Virginia's in the house. T exas is in the house. I'm 21 in the great state of Texas right now as well. 22 Listen, i f you guys have a ny questions, let 23 me know. I know -- Chrissy , I know in Wisconsin I 24 keep getting cut off. It's actually comical that I 25 keep getting cut off. But the reason why is they7 1 don't want you to hear the truth. They don't want you 2 to hear the messages that we've got or other doctors3 like myself have. I've already made mention of that.4 So I want to get back to the point, what I'm5 saying to you is that you're being fear-propagated6 into obeying. And that's what -- that's what this7 whole thing has been about. They wanted to control8 you. They found out how many of you they can control. 9 Now they're like, cool, let's double-down on it. 10 So let me just say -- here's what I want you 11 guys to hear. I got to publicly talk about this. I12 can't say this person's name, but he's allegedly going13 to become the President very soon. If I say the name,14 I'll get shut off social media. So I'm going to speak15 in code a little bit every once in a while.16 Hello, Jersey. Hello, New York. I see you17 all. I do. I see you all, Pittsburgh. I see18 everybody there. I love and appreciate you all more19 than you know. Hit that share button. Hit that share20 button.21 Nick and Amanda, a re you a doctor or a 22 chiropractor? I'm both. I don't know why that's23 confusing to people, y ou know. And here's another 24 thing. Can I say this? L et me just -- let's cover 25 this topic right now. The p roblem that people have is 8 1 that we believe that -- that degrees and letters 2 behind or in front of someone's name determines their 3 level of education. There 's a guy on TV known as Tony 4 Fauci, who is a doctor, but doesn't sound, act like 5 one, talk like one. This pers on surely doesn't have a 6 clue of how the immune system works, but yet the whole 7 world listens to what he has to say. 8 There are many, many, many types of health 9 care providers that are highly educated individuals 10 that are not the type of doctor that you would think 11 you would hear from. There are also many, many, many 12 doctors that are virologists and immunologists that 13 are not very bright i ndividuals. Just because 14 somebody went to school and got some letters behind 15 their name doesn't mean that they're very smart. 16 Remember this, and I say this all the time, 17 God may have created all men and women equal, but 18 definitely not all doctors. And that's for darn sure. 19 So let's talk about t his plan that this 20 individual has that's based off of fear and for 21 getting you to obey what t hey want you to do. And 22 please don't forget to share this and go to 23 freevitamindeals.com. That' s freevitamindeals.com. 24 Because, well, they're going to suppress -- this video 25 is going to get shut down in just a minute, okay? SoCase: 4:21-cv-00437 Cut Me Off Again Eric A.

Y ou're totally right. 3 Well, here you go. T here's a plan that's 4 laid out on the table, tha t was just laid out earlier 5 this week, that's going to take effect. If this6 individual becomes Presiden t of the United States, the 7 first 100 days, he wants to put 100 million vaccines 8 in the arms of Americans . Well, he said that he is 9 going to have to move heaven and earth to do this. 10 Well, I believe that's a very biblical thing. That is 11 a very biblical thing. Tha t is not just a metaphor. 12 There is no question in o rder to do that, that is good 13 versus evil, and on a w hole different level. On a 14 whole level.15 And if you want to hear more about that, you16 guys have got to go to fr eevitamindeals.com. That's 17 our website. It takes you back where you can go and 18 register for our newsle tter. Hit that share button. 19 Now, listen, there's a $1.9 trillion plan20 that's been laid out by this gentleman. And what it21 is, it's supposed to stop the virus and steady the 22 economy. All right. Well, here's what I'm going to23 say. We're fighting an -- an invisible enemy right 24 now because it's not real. It's not real. The CDC25 has come out clearly again and said that less than 6 10 1 percent of individuals that died during the COVID 2 outbreak truly died of C OVID-19. Everybody else died 3 from heart disease, can cer, diabetes, stroke, car 4 accidents, motorcycles, d a, da, da, all this stuff. 5 And by the way, those real numbers are6 already out there, and the real, real numbers are7 supposed to be lai d out by the CDC. Typically, by the 8 end of January, they have to put true causes of death9 of individuals from the years before. And then now 10 there's this big narrative out there saying that11 you've got a -- two milli on people have died globally 12 from COVID-19. Well, please remember that we're13 mislabeling and falsifyi ng the datas and a lot of 14 places are doing it on purpos e because they get paid 15 for it more.16 The CARES Act and all these other acts that17 are out there have set asid e extra money that Medicare 18 can pay doctors and, um -- and, um, pay doctors and 19 hospitals 20 percent higher, which is a fact -- I20 mean, nobody can deny that. I'm in the hospital21 system. I'm in the health care business. I know if22 we label people with COVID- 19, we get paid faster and 23 we get a 20 percent bump on our stuff. So it's greed,24 and hospitals and the health care industry is -- are25 really damn good at that. You think it really costs11 1 $200 for a blanket or $100 for a Tylenol? Are you 2 kidding me? We need real health care reform and 3 that's putting health and care back into health care. 4 We're just not there right now. 5 So here you go, guys, check this out. Hit 6 that share button and tag people because they're going 7 to want to hear this. 8 Here's the deal. So they want 100 million 9 vaccines in the next 100 days of, you know, the 10 presidency coming up. Well, how do you do that? 11 Well, there's only two ways you can do that. Really, 12 actually, there's three. Number one, it has to be 13 fear propagated, so people will only obey if they're 14 scared. People are moved away from pain and towards 15 pleasure. 16 So how are we going to move them away from 17 pain? Well, everybody thinks that if they get this 18 vaccine, they're not going to get infected when the 19 research really clearly states that it doesn't stop 20 the spread of the infection and the best that it can 21 do is minimize your symptoms of the disease, not stop 22 it, but minimize the symptoms of the disease. That's 23 a fact. 24 Everybody's who's in the know knows that and 25 has said that publicly. They just say it in a way 12 1 that you don't understand it properly. They say it's 2 going to protect you. Protect you how? It's kind of3 more like a Tamiflu than it is a vaccine.4 Now, the only thing that clearly has shown5 that it can stop the spread or the infection -- not6 even social distancing, not even wearing a mask,7 because if you look at states like California and New8 York, well, they've had 97 percent compliance this9 whole time with mask wearing, social distancing, and 10 shutting down businesses and, yet, they have more 11 infections and more disease than any other states that 12 are out there. So that ain't working out. You13 understand that?14 Now, I'm probably going to get shut off in a15 minute, so hit that share button or go to -- go to 16 freevitamindeals.com so you can follow us and all that17 stuff. Because here's the deal. They don't want you18 to know the truth. I'm about ready to start talking19 some common sense and all they want to hear is COVID 20 sense. So here you go.21 How do you do that? Well, you mandate it. 22 You have to make a manda te. Well, they said they're 23 not going to mandate it. W ell, they also said they're 24 not going to mandate wearing a mask, but you can't go25 to the grocery store, you can't 4:21-cv-00437 Cut Me Off Again Eric A. Nepute, DC 1/16/2021 (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555For The Record, Inc.4 (Pages 13 to 16)13 1 office, you can't go on an airplane, you can't travel 2 the world. You can't do things that bring you3 pleasure.4 Now, I j ust told you peopl e are m oved away 5 from pain and towards pleasure. So they're going to6 scare you to try to move you away from, um, uh, pain,7 which, you know, a lot of people -- there's 54,0008 adverse reactions that have been noted in the vaccine9 adverse reaction site on the CDC of COVID-19 and 10 deaths have occurred from it. And you all are seeing11 the videos circulating on the internet. That's sad12 whenever you see these videos of these nurses and13 these first responders that are really sick,14 neurological problems and et cetera, people that have15 dystonic co-kinesthesia where the body is just shaking16 uncontrollably and yet, they -- and yet, they -- they17 -- they shut down those people's video on social media18 and say they're not real. These are people dealing19 with real disease.20 And they're saying th at it's perpetuating 21 fear. Well, no, it's not. It's perpetuating facts. 22 It takes away your fear. And that's the problem. 23 They want you to be scared. They want you to be24 scared so that you'll obey. And you understand that,25 don't you? 14 1 Listen, I'm all about freedom to choose, but 2 how can you possibly choos e something if you don't 3 know the risk a nd the benefits? 4 Now, again, how do we mandate a vaccine? 5 Well, it's real simple. They give you a soft mandate. 6 Well, a soft mandate is a mandate that basically says, 7 well, you can't go to sc hool, you can't go to work, 8 you can't get a job, you can't get your tax return,9 you can't fly in an airplane if you don't have the 10 vaccine. You guys, a nybody who thinks that this isn't 11 real is absolutely crazy. They've already starting12 rolling out the vaccine pa ssports in certain countries 13 and airports. It's coming to America. It's actually14 here already. The y're just waiting for the right time 15 to roll it out.16 Now, please understand this. What else did17 this potential person do that's potentially going to 18 be president to get his 100 million vaccines into -- 19 his vaccines into 100 milli on people over the next 100 20 days? He brought in FEMA.21 Now, let me say something about that. Wow. 22 Now, you ever heard of som ething called a FEMA camp? 23 Well, they're already be ing built all across the 24 country. That's for sure. We're going to be seeing a25 lot more of them and a lot more martial law and15 1 lockdowns. They're already doing it in DC and a 2 couple other cities as well. But the fact remains is 3 they're going to force you to do this. 4 And FEMA -- how -- what do you think's going 5 to happen if the Federal Government, which means it's 6 a nat- -- it's a national emergency. FEMA only gets 7 brought in in national emergency situations. They're 8 going to force you to get this thing whether you like 9 it or not. So you got to learn how to protect 10 yourself. You got to learn what people supposedly 11 voted for. This is what you voted for. This is what 12 -- what people supposedly voted for was that. 13 Now, let me talk about this vaccine just for 14 a second, which is not really a vaccine. It's more of 15 a -- it's more of a genetic therapeutic. Because a 16 vaccine normally is a live, unattenuated or weakened 17 version of a virus with a bunch of adjuvants. It goes 18 into your body and then -- I'm definitely calling -- 19 I've been red-listed for a long time. 20 Let me tell you something. One of my good 21 friends said to me, if you're not on a government 22 watch list, you're some kind of sissy. And I -- let 23 me tell you something, I'm definitely not a sissy. 24 One of my best friends just got labeled as a domestic 25 terrorist because he was talking about the benefits of 16 1 vitamin D3. By the way, vitamin D3 is the only 2 chemical that's out there a nd that's shown to reduce 3 the spread -- sorry, to minimize the chances of4 getting infected.5 Journal of Pathogens -- sorry, Journal of --6 Journal of -- Nature Journa l 2020 showed that if your 7 vitamin D level is adequa te, that you have a 77 8 percent less chance of contracting COVID-19 in the9 first place, which is why every human man and woman 10 should be taking between 5,000 and 10,00011 international units a day of vitamin D3. And I've got 12 a free guide -- if you guys go to freevitamindeals.com13 -- it's freevitamindeals.com -- we've got a whole list14 of stuff you can do to prevent sickness and disease,15 viruses, and prevent and treat when -- when you have16 symptoms. And I've had millions of people download it17 and use it and it's -- it' s very effective and it 18 works.19 You got to be taking D3 and zinc every day. 20 You should take it, your c hildren should take it. 21 Vitamin D blocks the virus. That's a fact. Nobody22 can argue that. The FTC t ried to shut me down over 23 it. I showed them the papers and they're like, 24 (snapping fingers) shoot, this guy's right, we can't25 censor him for that because he's right. So you shouldCase: 4:21-cv-00437 Doc.

Because D3 blocks it and zinc 5 doesn't allow the virus to continue to proliferate. 6 So it actually works bette r than the -- than any 7 vaccine and you don't really need a vaccine. But if 8 you want one, you should be able to go get one, but 9 you need to know what's in it. 10 Now, let me ta lk about this vaccine just 11 for a minute while I'm getting into the 100-day plan 12 that this person has rolled out. So check this out. 13 You guys can follow me. Jus t go to -- ju st do this. 14 Go to freevitamindeals.com, freevitamindeals.com. 15 That's a -- that's a site that goes to my website, 16 which is ericnepute.com. Nobody can remember how to 17 spell Nepute, but everybody can remember 18 freevitamindeals.com. You s hould go there, register 19 for our emails and register for our daily info we give 20 out because there's a lot of info we give out. 21 So you should be taking D3, zinc, 22 probiotics, vitamin C every day. I've got a protocol 23 on there for a nebulizer that helps with respiratory 24 stress. It's amazing. I can 't tell you how many -- I 25 mean, now, hundreds of thousands of people that have 18 1 emailed us and told us how well they did by doing this 2 protocol.3 But, anyway, h ere's back on the vaccine. 4 It's not really a vaccine . It's more of a genetic 5 therapeutic. This is an mRNA -- this is an mRNA6 chemical that goes in your body with something called 7 polyethylene glycol, PEG. And this PEG -- if you go8 back and look at the anima l studies that were done by 9 Moderna and Pfizer back in 2012, they showed that when 10 they give the injecti on in the arm, that that 11 polyethylene glycol that they tell us that goes away12 and dissolves, that the va st majority of people are 13 allergic to. I mean, very allergic to to the point14 where they're having -- it' s ten times more allergic 15 than the flu shot. Y'all know that, don't you?16 Guys, hit that share button. I can see 17 our numbers are s tarting to drop, which means we're 18 about ready to get cut off because that's the way it19 happens with us. So you guys got to go to20 freevitamindeals.com to wat ch these -- these -- these 21 products or watch these v ideos and check out the 22 products that you need. And by the way, we're giving23 away another million bottle s of D3 and zinc. Why? 24 Because, well, they told us we can't. So I said, 25 let's double down and we' ll give another million19 1 bottles of D3 and zinc. So we're giving that stuff 2 away for free, plus educational classes for free to 3 get healthier. You guys got to go to that site and 4 get it. 5 So here's the -- he re's the deal on the 6 vaccine. The studi es I just talked to you guys about 7 with Pfizer and Moderna and all that kind of stuff, 8 the deal is this, is, um, uh -- no, listen, if you go 9 to freevitamindeals.com, Dia na. Freevitamindeals.com. 10 Go check that one out. 11 So what they found was the polyethylene 12 glycol actually crosses th e blood-brain barrier. So 13 it gets in the brain, which is why people are getting 14 Bell's palsy, why they're getting that dystonic co- 15 kinesthesia, which is that uncontrollable shaking. 16 I'm sure you've all seen t hose videos of the nurses 17 and medical assistants on th e internet that have been 18 taken down because they don't want you to know the 19 truth. 20 But think about this, they're going to put 21 FEMA involved with this ro llout of these vaccines. 22 That means it's a national emergency. Who's going to 23 pay for this, by the way? Like -- like that's $1.9 24 trillion. Do you guys know where that money comes 25 from? You know we don't have that money. We've been 20 1 off the fiat -- we've been on a fiat currency and off 2 the gold standard for a long time, which means -- fiat 3 means fugazi (whistling), it's fake. It's all paper. 4 It's all zeroes and ones. It's not real. There's 5 nothing backing that -- that -- that -- that money. 6 So where do we buy -- where do we borrow the 7 money from? Does anybody know where we borrow the 8 money from? I know. We borrow it from China and the 9 central banks. And so when China and the central 10 banks loan money to the United States -- let me ask 11 you this. Have any of you ever gone and got a loan 12 before? Any of you ever go get a loan? You know, 13 what do they ask you to put up as collateral? They 14 ask you to put something up , whether it's your house, 15 whether it's your, you know, money, whether it's your 16 stuff, whatever. 17 The bottom line is this, the United States 18 of America has put up collateral and that collateral 19 is our future. What do you mean by that? Well -- 20 well, you got to put up our land. I mean, look at -- 21 look at all the land that's being bought up by the 22 Chinese nationalists. I mean, Texas is getting bought 23 up, Oklahoma is getting bought up. I mean, it's crazy 24 what's really happening. A nd that's a fact, by the 25 way. And it's completely deflating our dollar.

That's4 not going to do anything ot her than make people not be 5 able to have more jobs.6 We're lite rally moving towards a culture of 7 -- I can't say the word, but it ends in \"ism\" and it 8 starts with \"social.\" And then I can't say the other9 word, but it ends with \"ism\" and it starts with 10 \"commu.\" So because if I say those words, I'll get11 shut off immediately, which is crazy.12 So that's what's happening. So, you know,13 if you look at this thing , a couple other things that 14 are really absolutely just unbelievable -- and I think 15 I've really laid out more of it. But, you know,16 where's the money come f rom? I already told you guys, 17 it's coming from the central banks, so it's coming18 from China. Man, we are completely FUBAR if that deal19 goes through.20 How are we going to repay this? You guys,21 it's not going to affect my generation, our generation 22 as much, but our kids' kids' kids, they're screwed. 23 They're -- they're never going to be able to pay this24 back. I mean, that's just the way it is. Unless we25 have a complete re set, they're never going to pay this 22 1 back. And that's just -- that's just unfortunate, but 2 that's the deal. We're literally looking at a world3 economic crash because of mismanagement.4 And what's going to happen is this. You5 know, with these mandates that are happening -- just6 mark my words, I'm going to prognosticate to you right7 now, and I've been right about all this stuff from the8 beginning, but here's what 's going to happen. What's 9 going to happen is this, is there's going to be a 10 federal mandate for masks for the next 100 days and11 there's going to be a so ft and eventually a hard 12 mandate for vaccines.13 Well, the state law overcedes federal law14 except for you can't go to state parks, you won't be15 able to go in state federal buildings, all that stuff.16 That will be mandated there. But what will happen is17 you're going to see a huge divide. You're going to 18 see Republican states that are not going to do the 19 mandates and you're going to see Democratic states20 that do it. And you're goi ng to see those Democratic 21 states, their economies are going to shut down,22 they're going to be living in filth.23 They're going to bas ically turn into like 24 what's happened in California, the wealthiest -- you25 know, the wealthiest state in the Union. I mean, my23 1 gosh, what is California, like the third or fourth 2 highest economy, period. And it's gone away and it's 3 going away. And, you know, you think about that, it's 4 absolutely -- it's crazy and it's scary, and that's 5 what's happening. 6 So, you know, our -- those economies, those 7 governors that say we're going to definitely go ahead 8 with the mandates and all this, those economies are 9 going to shut down, people are leaving. I mean, look 10 at -- look at like New York. Look at how many people 11 are moving to Texas, look at how many people are 12 moving to Florida. I mean, the East and West Coast 13 are done. Everybody's moving south now. And that's 14 what's happening because they want to get away from 15 the -- the -- the tyrannical governments. 16 And so, you know, what do we do? 17 People always ask, what do we do? Well, you got 18 to share this message, number one. Number two, 19 you got to -- you got -- guys, I need you to go to 20 freevitamindeals.com. That's freevitamindeals.com. 21 Protect yourself. Stop being so scared. Because 22 when you get the truth and understand the facts and 23 understand how to reduce your health -- or, sorry, 24 reduce your -- your risk for sickness, which is 25 getting your body to a good weight. 24 1 That's why we created that reset plan. 2 We've had literally tens of thousands of people just 3 over the last couple months lose thousands and4 hundreds of thousands -- actually, tens of thousands5 of pains, which is really cool.6 But you got to pr otect yourself, because 7 when the next thing come s -- because what they're 8 saying right now is if you don't -- the modelers are9 telling us, the same ones that were wrong about the -- 10 the 2.2 million people that are going to die in11 America, that obviously di dn't happen. They're saying 12 now that if we don't hurry up and rush up and get 13 everybody a vaccine, then -- then, well, by March and 14 April, the world's going to shut down again. They're 15 fearing you into that. T hey're saying, if you don't, 16 then this is going to ha ppen. They have no idea. 17 They're just trying to push an agenda toward you and18 fear you.19 You guys, hit that s hare button, pretty 20 please. People need to h ear this. And tag folks on 21 it as well.22 Those of you that don't me, I'm Dr. Eric23 Nepute. You guys can follow our real stories at 24 vita -- at freevitamindeals.com or you can go to25 ericnepute.com or share Cut Me Off Again Eric A. Nepute, DC 1/16/2021 (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555For The Record, Inc.7 (Pages 25 to 28)25 1 we'll send you a private message on this stuff. 2 Now, let me tell you what I do and what my3 patients do. I literally have hundreds of thousands4 of people across the country now that are taking high-5 dose vitamin D3 every day -- by the way, high-dose6 vitamin D3 helps with energy, helps your immune7 system, helps your brain function better, helps your8 body grow, helps your hormones produce, and it's -- it9 stops viruses from attaching to your cells in the 10 first place.11 We put every body on high-dose vitamin zinc 12 as well. It's a mineral that's the number one13 deficiency on the planet. Uh, and when you are14 deficient in this, your testosterone and hormones go15 down and your brain can't function. There's 30016 different enzymatic functions that -- that -- that17 zinc does that you need to -- you need to have in your18 system. Zinc also stops viruses from proliferating,19 which means they can't regenerate and grow.20 And then -- and that helps keep your brain21 and your mind right. If your brain and your mind,22 right, are good and you -- and you have energy, then23 you can fight back, right? You don't have to -- you24 don't have to be scared if your brain and -- you're25 like, well, of course this is stupid and it doesn't 26 1 make sense to you and that's because you're balanced. 2 You s hould be doing, uh, vitamin C every day 3 to bowel tolerance. You should be doing, um -- you4 should be doing, um, probi otics. And then if you go 5 to that protocol, that freevitamindeals.com -- it's 6 freevitamindeals.com -- you can go there and there's a7 free flu and cold and virus prevention and treatment8 protocol. Every man, woman, and child should have9 that. They should print that off, put it on your 10 refrigerator. Give copies to your friends and family. 11 Take a text of it. Send it to people. Picture of it12 and send it. Because peopl e need to know what they 13 can do. I've got hundreds of thousands of people that 14 are doing it and doing amazing with that.15 And then I put together a free course. It's16 a 12-video series on how to de-stress and how to get17 yourself healthier. That's the key. Man, it's so18 important to do that. Twelve-video series for free to19 teach you how to get better . That really ticked off a 20 lot of doctors because, well, if you're not sick --21 fat, sick and nearly dead, then you're not living in22 fear. So I'm just trying to help get rid of the fear.23 And then, y ou know, 99 percent of my 24 patients take this immune system pack that I created25 that has Quercetin in it. High levels of Quercetin is27 1 an \"iontofer.\" It allows minerals to get in your 2 system. That's important.3 Jennifer, if you have questions about4 nutrients, go to that freevitamindeals.com. Go5 download that -- th at protocol there. 6 But that's what's happening right now. It's7 absolutely crazy and we ju st decided to up our game 8 again because, you know, if the world is ending, I9 want to make everybody as h ealthy and happy and joyful 10 as we can. And so we just decided we're going to --11 we just purchased another million bottles of D3 and a 12 million bottles of zinc to g ive to everybody for free. 13 Y'all can have that becau se I need you to understand 14 how much better you're going to feel and how much 15 better you do if that's there.16 So think about all this crazy stuff17 happening in the world and how muc h you've been lied 18 to. You know, let me read one more thing because19 every time I read this, I get shut off. So this is20 going to happen. I'm going to get shut off here in a 21 minute. But I'm going to read this because this is22 important.23 The 350,000 deaths that you've been told24 that have happened from COVID-19 that have been over-25 labeled, over bl own out, blown out of proportion, the 28 1 CDC even claims that only 6 percent of people really 2 died from COVID-19, not just with it. So let me read3 this list to you. Here's the list. Write this down4 or share this, you guys.5 Here's what we have. 87,000-plus people on6 this list from the CDC died from pneumonias and flus,7 17,000-plus died of chronic respiratory disease;8 26,000-plus people died of respiratory distress9 syndrome; 44,000-plus people died of hypertensive 10 disease but were labeled as death of COVID; 25,000-11 plus people died of heart disease that were labeled as 12 a COVID death; 28,000 people plus died of13 cardiovascular risk or heart attacks that was labeled14 as COVID. If you look, 15, 000 people actually on the 15 list from the CDC, on the list from the CDC actually16 died in hospice care that were labeled as a death from17 COVID-19.18 Again, the CARES Act that was put in in19 March gives a 20 percent bump in bonus to doctors and 20 -- I told you it was going to freeze because I started21 talking about the CDC. This cracks me up. Y'all22 understand the suppression is real? You guys see23 that, don't you? I told you.24 So go to freevitamindeals.com. I am the25 most suppressed doctor in the world and I'm proud ofCase: 4:21-cv-00437 Doc. Cut Me Off Again Eric A.
