Similar codes are expected as other vaccines advance in testing, AMA said.", "sitename": "Medscape", "date": "2020-12-11", "cleaned_text": "The largest US physician organization on Tuesday took a step to prepare for future payments for administration of two leading COVD-19 vaccine candidates, publishing new billing codes tailored to track each use of these medications. The American Medical Association (AMA) updated its Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code set to reflect the expected future availability of COVID-19 vaccines. The new codes apply to the experimental vaccine being developed by Pfizer Inc, in collaboration with a smaller German firm BioNTech, and to the similar product expected from US biotech Moderna Inc, according to an [AMA press release.](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/cpt/covid-19-cpt-vaccine-and-immunization-codes) Positive news has emerged this week about both of these vaccines, which were developed using a newer \u2014 and as yet unproven \u2014 approach. They seek to use messenger RNA to instruct cells to produce a target protein for SARS-CoV-2. New York-based Pfizer on Monday announced interim phase 3 data that was widely viewed as promising. Pfizer said the vaccine appeared to be 90% effective, [as reported by](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/940628) [ Medscape Medical News ](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/940628), in preventing COVID-19 in trial volunteers who were without evidence of prior infection of the virus. In a [ press release](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-vaccine-candidate-against) , Pfizer said it plans to ask the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to consider a special clearance, known as an emergency use authorization (EUA), \"soon after\" a safety milestone is achieved in its vaccine trial. That milestone could be reached this month. Moderna said it was on track to report early data from a late-stage trial of its experimental coronavirus vaccine later this month, and could file with the FDA for an EUA in early December, according to [a Reuters report](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/940763). The severity of the global pandemic has put the [FDA under pressure](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/938780) to move quickly on approval of COVID-19 vaccines, based on limited data, while also working to make sure these products are safe. The creation of CPT codes for each of two coronavirus vaccines, as well as accompanying administration codes, will set up a way to keep tabs on each dose of each of these shots, the AMA said. \"Correlating each coronavirus vaccine with its own unique CPT code provides analytical advantages to help track, allocate and optimize resources as an immunization program ramps up in the United States,\" said AMA President Susan R. Bailey, MD, in the release. AMA plans to introduce more vaccine-specific CPT codes as more vaccine candidates approach FDA review. These vaccine-specific CPT codes can go into effect only after the FDA grants a clearance, the AMA said. The newly created Category I [CPT codes](https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/2020-11/covid-19-immunizations-appendix-q-table.pdf) and long descriptors for the vaccine products are: 91300; Severe acute respiratory coronavirus vaccine, mcg/0.5mL dosage, for intramuscular use (Moderna) These two administrative codes would apply to the Pfizer-BioNTech shot: 0001A; Immunization administration by intramuscular injection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Coronavirus disease [COVID-19]) vaccine, mL diluent reconstituted; first dose. 0002A; Immunization administration by intramuscular injection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Coronavirus disease [COVID-19]) vaccine, mcg/0.3 mL dosage, diluent reconstituted; second dose. And these two administrative codes would apply to the Moderna shot: 0011A; Immunization administration by intramuscular injection of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Coronavirus disease [COVID-19]) mL dosage; first dose. 0012A; Immunization administration by intramuscular injection of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Coronavirus disease [COVID-19]) free, 100 mcg/0.5 mL dosage; second dose.
