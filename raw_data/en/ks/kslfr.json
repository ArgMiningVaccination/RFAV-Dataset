But aromatherapy, as we know it today, originated in the 20th by a French chemist, Ren\u00e9-Maurice Gattefoss\u00e9, who conducted many studies on essential oils and their benefits in certain diseases. The popularity of these oils grew, with it, the multiple applications in health and beauty. It is an herbal technique, where essential oils have the main function of improving mood and health through inhaling or applying the oils on the skin. But, what is exactly a natural essential oil? This is made from fragrances extracted from plants, seeds, or fruits. It is an aromatic and non-greasy concentrate that is obtained from various natural chemical processes. There are 2 ways to use essential oils and take advantage of their benefits: - Inhalation: It is the most common aromatherapy because our sense of smell directly activates the limbic system, which is responsible for regulating our emotions. In this case, a special diffuser can be used to spread the essential oil. - On the skin: Not every essential oil is specifically for the skin. It is usually already diluted with other oils or water since such strong concentrate ingredients could harm your skin. Its main purpose is to hydrate and nourish the skin. Also, a massage with these oils stimulates the elasticity and firmness of the skin. A massage full of benefits The energies and the different intentions we put into something always enhance the effects they have on us, and essential oils are no exception.
