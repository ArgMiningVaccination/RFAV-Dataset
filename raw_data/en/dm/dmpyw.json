Rendering providers in good standing may join existing provider groups. The group may begin billing for the services delivered by a n already enrolled rend ering provider by affiliating with the rendering provider via the PAVE Portal. Rendering providers need to apply to Medi -Cal only once but must affi liate with each subsequent group they work for via the PAVE Portal. To initially enro ll as a rendering provider, the applicant needs to submit a complete application package to PED via the PAVE Portal on the DHCS website (https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/provgovpart/Pages/PAVE.aspx ). How to Apply for Enrollment or Submit Supplemental Changes via the PAVE Portal To submit enrollment and supplemental applications, providers can access the PAVE Portal on the DHCS website (https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/provgovpart/Pages/PAVE.aspx ). DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 22 09/01/2023 How to Obtain Enrollment and Supplement al Changes Forms Changes previously reported on the Medi -Cal Supplemental Changes (DHCS 6209) form must now be reported via the PAVE Portal (https://pave.dhcs.ca.gov/sso/login.do ), paper forms are no longer accepted . 2.1.3.4 Obligations to Members Eligibility Verification Obligates Provider to Render Services When a provider elects to verify a member 's Medi -Cal eligibility, the provider has agreed to accept an individual as a Medi -Cal patient once the information obtained verifies that the individual is eligible to receive Medi -Cal benefits . The provider is then bound by the rules and regulations governing Medi -Cal once a Medi -Cal patient has been acce pted into the provider's care. After receiving verification that a member is Medi -Cal Rx eligible , a provider cannot deny services because: The member has other health insurance coverage in addition to Medi -Cal. Providers must not bill the member for priva te insurance cost -sharing amounts such as deductibles, coinsurance , or copayments because such payments are covered by Medi -Cal up to the Medi -Cal maximum allowances. Providers are reminded that Medi -Cal is the payer of last resort . Medicare and Other Heal th Coverage must be billed prior to submitting claims to Medi -Cal. The member has both Medicare and Medi -Cal Rx. Providers must not treat the member as if the member is eligible only for Medicare and then collect Medicare deductibles and coinsurance from t he member , according to a 1983 United State s District Court decision, Samuel v. California Department of Health Services . The service requires the provider to obtain authorization. Circumstances that Exempt Providers from Rendering Services A provider may decline to treat a member , even after eligibility verification has been requested, under the following circumstances: The member has refused to pay or obligate to pay the required Share of Cost (SOC). DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 23 09/01/2023 The member has only limited Medi -Cal Rx benefits and the requested services are not covered by Medi -Cal Rx. The member is required to receive the requested services from a designated health plan. This includes cases in which the member is enrolled in an MCP or has private insurance through a Hea lth Maintenance Organization (HMO) or exclusive provider network, and the provider is not a member provider of that health plan. The provider cannot render the particular service(s) that the member requires. The member is not eligible for Medi -Cal Rx for t he month in which service is requested. The member is unable to present corroborating identification with the BIC to verify that he or she is the individual to whom the BIC was issued. Payment From Members When Medi -Cal Rx eligibility has been verified, pr oviders must submit a claim for reimbursement according to the rules and regulations of Medi -Cal Rx. Provider must not attempt to obtain payment from members for the cost of Medi -Cal Rx covered health care services. Payment received by providers from DHCS in accordance with Medi -Cal Rx fee structures constitutes payment in full. Provider Billing after Member Reimbursement For information about billing Medi -Cal Rx after reimbursing the member , refer to Section 1 9.6 - Member Reimbursement Claims . Non-SOC Payments Must be Refunded Unless it is used to satisfy an SOC requirement, any payment received from a Medi -Cal Rx member must be refunded upon receipt of a Medi -Cal Rx Remittance Advice (RA) reflecting payment for that service. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 24 09/01/2023 2.1.3. 5 Electronic Claim Submission Providers may submit claims to the Medi -Cal Rx vendor via telecommunications and other electronic media in the manner and format approved by California W&I Code, Section 14040. Regulations for participation are located in CCR, Title 22, Section 51502.1. Participation as a Web Claims submitter/Direct Data Entry submitter is open to most Medi -Cal Rx providers, assuming submitted claims are in an acceptable format. To obtain approval to submit claims electronically through the Medi -Cal Rx vendor , providers mu st enroll via UAC (see Section 3.6.1.2 - Secured Provider Portal ). 2.1.3. 6 DHCS and Provider Tax Reporting Responsibilities Introduction DHCS is required by Federal Regulation, Section 3406 of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Code , to report the amount of payments made to providers and the provider name/Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) combination associated with these payments using Form 1099 -MISC . DHCS will only issue the Form 1099 -MISC on total amount RA reimbursements greater than or equal to $600 per NPI. Form W -9 DHCS sends a letter of notification and a copy of Form W -9 to providers reported by the IRS as having an invalid name/TIN combination. An invalid name/TIN combination occurs when a provider enrolls in Medi -Cal Rx with a TIN that the IRS shows as belonging to another person ; for example, \"Fred Jones,\" enrolls in M edi-Cal Rx with a TIN that the IRS shows as belonging to \"Bob Smith.\" If providers do not furnish DHCS with a completed Form W -9 by the date indicated on the notice, DHCS is required to withhold 31 percent of the provider's payments until a W-9 is received . These withheld amounts are forwarded to the IRS, and the provider must work with the IRS to receive any refun ds through justification requests. To expedite the correction, providers should include a copy of the IRS payment coupon, or other document from the IRS, that displays both the provider's name and TIN. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 25 09/01/2023 To prevent any withholding action, providers must return a completed and signed Form W-9 to the appropriate address on the notice. The notification letter must accompany the W -9 to ensure credit to the correct provider number. Substitute forms will not be accepted. Common TIN Errors The following section outlines some of the most common mis takes that cause invalid TIN information. Name Changes Providers change their business name and fail to notify DHCS. Because DHCS is still using the old name, the new name will cause a mismatch with IRS records. Providers must notify DHCS if their business name changes. Because multiple business name changes indicate an ownership change , providers must be pr epared to demonstrate that there has been no ownership change. However, i f there has been a change, a new provider number will be issued with an application. Social Security Numbers (SSN) SSN errors can occur when a provider who is a partnership, corporati on, hospital , or clinic is using an individual provider's SSN. In this situation, the Employee Identification Number (EIN) of the partnership, corporation, hospital , or clinic should be used . Providers should o nly use an SSN with an individual's name. SSN errors can also occur if the provider is an individual provider who should be using his or her own SSN, but instead the provider is using the EIN of the partnership, corporation, hospital , or clinic of which he or she is a member. Providers should always use their SSN in combination with their name. EIN Mix-Ups EIN mix -ups occur when the provider is an operating unit of a larger business entity, and the operating unit is using its own name with the larger business entity's EIN. This will cause a mismatch with IRS records. In this case, operating units should apply for their own EIN or use the name of the larger business entity. Mix-ups also occur when the provider is identifying the business with initials instead of his or her complete name, DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 26 09/01/2023 as recorded with the IRS. This will cause a mismatch of the provider's name and EIN with IRS records. Providers should use their comp lete name as recorded with the IRS. Doing Business As (DBA) DBA e rrors can occur when t he provider i s a sole owner using his or her DBA name with his or her SSN or EIN of sole ownership. A sole owner must always put his or her name first; the DBA name may be listed second . Change of ownership Change of ownership errors can occur when t he provider's business has changed ownership and the provider failed to notify DHCS. Since DHCS is still using the TIN and name of the previous owner, this will cause a mismatch with IRS records. Providers must notify DHCS when their business has changed ownership. IRS Contacts The second page of the Form W -9 gives more specific instructions about the name of the TIN that should be submitted to DHCS in accordance with IRS reporting requirements. For more information about TINs, call the IRS at 1 -800-829-1040. If you need more in formation about how to apply for a TIN, call the IRS at (209) 452-4010, Monday through Friday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. For more information about SSNs, contact your nearest Social Security Administration district office. 2.1.3. 7 Inactivated Providers Introductio n DHCS conducts a periodic inactivation of pharmacy providers who no longer bill Medi - Cal Rx. Providers who receive Medi -Cal Rx bulletins with their provider number on the mailing label, but who have discontinued billing Medi -Cal Rx and have not receiv ed a payment during the last 12 months, may have their provider number inactivated. Exceptions Providers who are located where Medi -Cal Rx is administered by a prepaid health program directed by the county are exempt from periodic inactivation. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 27 09/01/2023 Inact ivation for Returned Mail DHCS regularly inactivates providers when their mail (including Medi -Cal Rx checks) is returned by the post office as undeliverable. Therefore, providers who have changed their service and/or pay -to-address, or any other related i nformation, should notify DHCS DATA Unit. Inactivation Benefits Periodic inactivation reduces: Payment errors such as sending a payment to the wrong provider because the provider number entry is incorrect . The cost of handling return mail from providers w ho are no longer in business at the address indicated on the PMF.

The ERA/RA lists pharmacy provider's claims adjudicated during a given time frame as outlined in Section 3.3.2 - Checkwrite Schedule . The ERA/RA delivery coincides with the Medi -Cal Rx Release Date . The Medi -Cal Rx -provided ERA/RA is used by pharmacy providers to reconcile their records with claims that have been paid, reversed, or denied. The ERA/RA is provided weekly by Medi -Cal Rx checkwrite streams in which claims submitted by the pharmacy provider were adjudicated. The Medi -Cal Rx checkwrite streams are Abortion, Medi -Cal, CCS, GHPP, and State Children 's Health Insurance Prog ram (SCHIP). Pharmacy providers receive a separate payment for each Medi -Cal Rx checkwrite stream in which claims were adjudicated and a net payment was determined. To request ERAs, a pharmacy provider must complete an ERA Authorization Agreement. The agr eement may be submitted two ways: 1. The pharmacy provider may log in to the Medi -Cal Rx Secured Provider Portal and select Finance Portal from the left -hand menu to access the ERA information page and the ERA Authorization Agreement. 2. The pharmacy provider may complete and mail the Medi -Cal Rx Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) Authorization Agreement Form (DHCS 655 0) by going to the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal Forms & Information page. DHCS 6550 forms are mailed to the Medi -Cal Rx vendor (see Appendix B - Directory for mailing address). While completing the ERA Authorization Agreement (by either method), the pharmacy provider may also identify others they want to allow access to their ERAs; these s elected others are known as Receivers. The ERA and Receiver information can be updated, by the pharmacy provider, at any time by either of the methods described. Pharmacy providers with questions regarding ERA Authorization Agreements may call the Customer Service Center (CSC) at 1 -800-977-2273. ERAs are directly delivered through the Medi -Cal Rx Secured Provider Portal. Once logged in to the Medi -Cal Rx Secured Provider Portal, the pharmacy provider and DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 35 09/01/2023 designated Receivers are able to download the HIPAA -compliant 835 file to their preferred application, or they are able to view and print from a CMS -provided Medicare Remit Easy Print (MREP) Software tool. Note: The MREP tool can be downloaded from the Medi-Cal Rx Provider Portal Forms & Information page. ERAs are produced weekly in coordination with the Medi -Cal Rx payment release schedule. They may appear a day or two prior to the payment release date. If the pharmacy provider has not opted -in for ERAs, a paper RA is mailed to the provider's Pay To address that is on file with the DHCS PED. To update the Pay To address on file with PED, the pharmacy provider needs to utilize the PAVE Portal In addition to the mailed paper RA, the pharmacy provider can access a soft -copy PDF document once they are logged in to the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal . See Section 3.3.3.1 - Paper Remittance Advice Example for an explanation of form fields and sample reimbursement data for Medi -Cal Rx claims. The mailed paper RA is a two - sided, 8\u00bd x 11 -inch document. 3.3.3.1 Paper Remittance Advice Example A paper RA details the pharmacy provider's adjudicated c laim and Account s Receivable (AR) activity for a given check write stream .

Table 3.4-1: Reject Code s/Reject Messages DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 44 09/01/2023 It is strongly encourage d that a pharmacy's software has the capability to submit backdated claims. Occasionally, a pharmacy may also receive messages that indicate its own network is ha ving problems communicating with the Medi -Cal Rx vendor . If this occurs, or if a pharmacy is experiencing technical difficulties connecting with the Medi -Cal Rx vendor's system, pharmacies should follow the steps outlined below: 1. Check the system status which can be found on the Medi -Cal Rx Web Portal . 2. Check the terminal and communicatio ns equipment to ensure that electrical power and telephone services are operational. 3. Call the telephone number that the system is dialing and note the information heard (i.e., fast busy, steady busy, recorded message). 4. Contact the software vendor if unab le to access this information in the system. 5. If the pharmacy has an internal technical staff, forward the problem to that department. 6. If unable to resolve the problem after following the steps outlined above, directly contact the Medi -Cal Rx Customer Ser vice Center at 1 -800-977-2273. 3.5 Automated Eligibility Verification System (AEVS) The AEVS is an interactive voice response system that allows users the ability - through a touch -tone telephone - to access and clear Share of Cost ( SOC) liability , and/or reserve a Medi -Service (a Medi -Service is not relevant to pharmacy providers). Medi -Cal Rx pharmacy providers may use AEVS to lookup Share of Cost and do Share of Cost spend downs. Medi -Cal Rx pharmacy providers should use the POS syst em or the Beneficiary Eligibility Lookup tool accessible via the Medi -Cal Rx Secured Provider Portal to verify member eligibility. AEVS Telephone Number: 1 -800-456-AEVS (2387) While no enrollment is necessary to participate and utilize AEVS, Providers must use a valid Provider Identification Number (PIN), which is issued when providers enroll with Medi -Cal. In the instance when a provider does not remember th eir PIN, the TSC DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 45 09/01/2023 technical help desk agents are authorized to release the existing PIN once caller validation protocols have been completed. Providers may call the TSC at 1-800-541-5555 ( Note : The TSC is different from the Medi -Cal Rx Customer Service Center [CSC]). As PIN release is governed by discrete caller validation protocols, there are circumstances in which the TSC technical help desk agent may only be authorized to re -issue the PIN letter with the existing PIN. If this is authorized, the PIN lette r will be sent to the provider's Pay -To address on file. For more detailed information related to AEVS refer to the applicable links in the DHCS Provider Manual (Part 1 - Medi -Cal Program and Eligibility) . See Table 3.5-1 for additional contact information .

California Specific Compound Pharmacy Claim Form (30 -4) is used when billing for Multi -Ingredient compound pharmacy claims , single -ingredient sterile DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 56 09/01/2023 Accepted Claim Formats Description Format Comments Pharmacy Claim Form (30-4)) transfer claims , and for crossover claims. Beneficiary Submitted Paper Beneficiary Reimbursement Claim Form (see Section 19.6 - Beneficiary Reimbursement Claims ) Also referred to as a \"Conlan\" claim. Claims Inquiry Form Claims Inqui ry Form (see Section 19.4 - Medi Inquiry DHCS 6570) ) Claim Inquiry Forms (CIFs) are used after submitting a claim to request one of the following : An Adjustment Reconsideration Tracer Web Claims Submission (Direct Data Entry) NCPDP D.0 Batch File Transfer Protocol (FTP) NCPDP Batch 1.2 SFTP is the communication method for batch files/ media. Table 4.1-1: Accepted Claim Formats 4.2 NCPDP Version D.0 The Medi -Cal Rx vendor uses a claim(s) processing system that verifies at a minimum the following categories : NCPDP claim submission standards Member eligibility Drug Coverage Dispensing limits Pricing DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 57 09/01/2023 Payment ProDUR Note : The Medi -Cal Rx vendor's claim(s) processing system provides real -time claims messaging and reject codes when a claim is submitted via POS or Web -Claim Submission/Direct -Data Entry. For example, drug products that have dispensing limits will deny with Reject Code 76 - Plan Limitations Exceeded , if the product was submitted for greater than the allowed limit. The POS system is used in conjunction with a pharmacy's in -house operating sy stem. While there are a variety of different pharmacy operating systems, the information contained in this manual specifies only the response messages related to the interactions with the Medi -Cal Rx vendor's online system and not the technical operation o f a pharmacy's in -house -specific system. Pharmacies should check with their software vendors to ensure their system is able to process the payer specifications listed in Appendix A - NCPDP Standard Payer Sheet of this manual. 4.2.1 Supported Transaction Types The Medi -Cal Rx vendor has implemented the following NCPDP Version D.0 transaction types. A pharmacy's ability to use these transaction types wi ll depend on its software. At a minimum , pharmacies should have the capability to submit original claims (B1), reversals (B2) , re-bills (B3) , and eligibility verification transactions (E1). Other transactions supported by Medi -Cal Rx can be found in Appendix A - NCPDP Standard Payer Sheet . Full Claims Adjudication (Code B1) - This transaction captures an d processes the claim and returns the dollar amount allowed under the program's reimbursement formula. The B1 transaction will be the prevalent transaction used by pharmacies. Claims Reversal (Code B2) - This transaction is used by a pharmacy to cancel a claim that was previously adjudicated . The pharmacy must locate the paid claim which they would like to reverse and then select the reversal option. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 58 09/01/2023 Note : Claims that have not successfully paid (adjudicated) cannot be reversed. Providers may contact the C SC at 1-800-977-2273 if an override is required for a reversal that has not successfully processed. Claims Re -Bill (Code B3) - This transaction is used by the pharmacy to adjust and resubmit a claim that has received a PAID status. A \"claim re-bill\" voids the original claim and resubmits the claim within a single transaction. The B3 claim is identical in format to the B1 claim with the only difference being that the transaction code (Field # 1 03) is equal to B3. Eligibility Inquiry (Code E1) - This transaction is used by the pharmacy to provide the status of a member 's Medicare health plan covering the individual, along with details regarding primary and supplemental coverage if applicable. Note : The following fields must match the original pa id claim for a successful transmission of B2 (Reversal) or B3 (Re -Bill): Service Provider Identification ( ID) - NCPDP Provider Number Prescription Number Date of Service (Date Filled) 4.2.2 Nonsupported Transaction Types The Medi -Cal Rx vendor's POS system will not accept the following NCPDP Version D.0 transaction types: N1 = Information Reporting N2 = Information Reporting Reversal N3 = Information Re -Bill C1 = Controlled Substance Reporting C2 = Controlled Substance Reporting Reversal C3 = Controlled Sub stance Reporting Re -Bill Note : Providers that report 340B claims on N -Type transactions are not and will not be considered compliant with DHCS policy. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 59 09/01/2023 4.2.3 Required Data Elements When a pharmacy is setting -up their POS system to allow access to required fields and to accept adjudication for Medi -Cal Rx claims, the pharmacy's software vendor needs the Medi -Cal Rx vendor 's payer specifications (see Appendix A - NCPDP Stand ard Payer Sheet ). The Medi -Cal Rx vendor 's claims processing system has program specific field requirements (such as , mandatory, required, and required when ). Medi -Cal Rx claims will not be processed without all the req uired (or mandatory) data elements. Required (or mandatory) fields may or may not be used in the adjudication process. Also, fields not required at this time may be required at a future date. Payer Specifications and Program Set -up Information A list of supported transaction types and their field requirements, as well as BIN, PCN, Group#, etc. , is available and can be found in Appendix A - NCPDP Standard Payer Sheet . 4.3 NCPDP Batch File Submission Pharmacy providers who are interested in submitting batch files to Medi -Cal Rx for pharmacy claims, pharmacy PAs, and/or member eligibility verification must ensure the transactions adhere to the NCPDP Ver sions D.0 and 1.2 Standards. R efer to the Medi -Cal Rx NCPDP Payer Specification Sheet for additional information on the NCPDP transactions and standards. To initiate the Medi -Cal Rx batch file submission process , send an email request to MediCalSystemsGroup @magellanhealth.com with the following information: As the subject line of the email, include text of \"Medi -Cal Rx Batch File Setup Request for [pharmacy name]\" to ensure the email is appropriately directed.

The address that pharmacies must use when sending completed paper claims/billings. Completion instructions for the UCF , (30-1), and (30-4) forms are listed in the following sections: Section 1 9.1.1 - Completion Instructions for the Universal Claim Form , Section 19.2.1.1 - Completion Instructions for California Specific Pharmacy Claim Form (30-1), and Section 1 9.2.2.1 - Completion Instructions for California Specific Compound Pharmacy Claim Form (30 -4). Examples of claims for which a UCF , California Specific Pharmacy (30-1), or California Specific Compound Claim Form (30-4) may be submitted include, but are not limited to , the following: Prescriptions Exceeding the Timely Filing Limit - Paper claims are allowed when the timely filing limit is exceeded. It is the pharmacy's responsibility to obtain an DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 61 09/01/2023 authorization override prior to submitting the paper claims. Paper claims requiring author ization overrides that are submitted without the pharmacy first obtaining the authorization override, will be denied with the applicable reject code and messaging. The denial will be visible via the Provider Portal , the POS system or on the RAD once the pa per claim has been processed. Non-Compound Claims (UCF or (30-1) form(s)) Multi -Ingredient Compound Claims (UCF or (30-4) form(s)) Note : Claims made by a member can be submitted using the Beneficiary Reimbursement Claim Form , sometimes referred to as a \" Conlan Claim Form .\" Additional information regarding Beneficiary Claims can be found in Section 1 9.6 - Beneficiary Reimbursement Claims . 4.5 Web Claims Submission/Direct -Data Entry The Web Claims Submission (WCS) /Direct Data Entry tool allows pharmacy providers to securely (once registered via UAC and logged in) submit claims and prior authorizations and also search for claims by Cardholder ID and fill date. For more information on web claims submission/direct -data entry , see Section 3.6.1.2.1 - Web Claim Submission/Direct Data Entry . For information on prior authorization s and submission methods, see Section 14.0 - Prior Authorization Overview, Request Methods , and Adjudication . 4.6 Reimbursement The follow ing sub -sections contain information regarding how reimbursement is calculated for legend, non -legend drugs, select medical supplies , and enteral nutrition products . 4.6.1 Legend and Non -Legend Drugs Reimbursement for any outpatient drug (including Over -the-Counter (OTC) drugs, Physician Administered Drugs (PADs) , and vaccines) covered under Medi -Cal Rx is the lowest of either of the following: DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 62 09/01/2023 1. The drug's ingredient cost, plus a professional dispensing fee. a. Where the drug's ingredient cost is equal to the lowest of the following: i. National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC), or when no NADAC is available, the Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) . ii. Maximum Allowable Ingredient Cost (MAIC) . iii. Federal Upper Limit (FUL). 2. The pharmacy's usual and customary charge. Note : Additional product cost due to special packaging will not be reimbursed (for example: unit of use, modified unit dose , or unit dose) . 4.6.2 Professional Dispensing Fee Unless noted otherwise below, DHCS utilizes a two -tiered professional disp ensing fee based on a pharmacy's total (both Medicaid and non -Medicaid ) annual claim volume as follows: Less than 90,000 claims per year = $13.20 90,000 or more claims per year = $10.05 Note : No fee or markup is calculated when the Total Ingredient/Produc t Cost is equal to $0.00. This applies to the two -tier professional fee, sterilization, and compounding fees. 4.6.2.1 Pharmacy Provider Self -Attestation Pursuant to W&I Code, Section 14105.45 , the two-tiered professional dispensing fee is based on a pharmacy provider's total ( Medi -Cal Rx and non -Medi -Cal Rx) annual pharmacy claim volume ($13.20 if fewer than 90,000 claims per year; $10.05 if 90,000 or more). Reporting the claim volume is a self -attestation process , which must be submitted electronically and must be repeated annually. Note : DHCS policy is that a claim is equivalent to a dispensed prescription; therefore, the attestation is for the total dispensed prescription volume. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 63 09/01/2023 Only Medi -Cal Rx providers dispensing less than 90,000 total prescriptions per calendar year are eligible to receive the higher of the two professional dispensing fees , and they must complete th e attestation annually in order to receive it. Medi -Cal Rx providers with more than 90,000 total prescriptions are not required to participate in the annual attestation process. Providers that do not submit a timely attestation will be automatically assigned the lower of the two professional dispensing fees. Self-attestations for each calendar year will begin in March after the close of the calendar year. The attestation period lasts approximately four (4) weeks. The attestation for each calendar year reporting period will determine the professional dispensin g fee component of the pharmacy claim reimbursement for claims with dates of service within the state's following fiscal year. As an example , the 20 21 calendar year volume attestation will determine the professional dispensing fee for claims within the State's 202 2-2023 fiscal year (dates of service on or after July 1, 202 2, through June 30, 2023). 4.6.2.2 Professional Dispensing Fee Limitations, Frequency of Billing Pursuant to CCR, Title 22, Section 51513(b)(3), full payment (drug ingredient cost plus a p rofessional dispensing fee component) to a pharmacy is limited , based on policy for specific products, to a maximum of 3 claims for the same drug and strength dispensed to the same member within any 75 -day period. The 4th claim from any provider, and any s ubsequent claims for the same drug and strength dispensed to the same member within any 75 -day period will not be paid a dispensing fee, claims will be paid at the ingredient cost only. The exceptions to the frequency of billing rule as mentioned above are : If it is the initial prescription. When authorization is obtained for more frequent billing. When drugs are dispensed in a quantity of 180 or more tablets or capsules. Examples of Professional Dispensing Fee Control Exceptions : Oral Contraceptives require a minimum dispensing quantity of 3 cycles. Liquid Potassium products and Theophylline products require a minimum dispensing DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 64 09/01/2023 quantity of 480cc. If claims for those products are submitted for less than the stated minimum dispensing quantity, as a 30 -day supply, the pharmacy will only get a dispensing fee for the first fill. On subsequent fills, only an ingredient cost will be paid and no dispensing fee. The exceptions for the minimum quantity restrictions mentioned above are: If it is the initial prescription . When a PA is obtained for a smaller quantity. Refer to the CDLs (found on the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal by selecting Forms & Information ) for drugs/products that have a frequency of billing requirement. These products will be marked with a symbol (+). 4.6.3 Drug Price Types 4.6.3.1 National Average Drug Acquis ition Cost (NADAC) When available, t he NADAC is used in the formula for determining drug ingredient cost reimbursement for covered outpatient drugs. The NADAC is a national drug -pricing benchmark determined by a federal survey, representing the national average invoice price for drug products based on invoices from wholesalers and manufacturers submitted by retail community pharmacies. Note : It is the resp onsibility of providers to monitor the published NADAC pricing on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Pharmacy pricing website. Providers may request a NADAC rate review by completing the NADAC Request for Medicaid Reimbursement Review form found at www.medicaid.gov . 4.6.3.2 Maximum Allowable Ingredient Cost (MAIC) Reimbursement Program The DHCS has contracted with the Medi -Cal Rx vendor, who contr acted with Mercer Government Human Services Consulting (Mercer), part of Mercer Health and Benefits LLC, to establish and maintain a Maximum Allowable Ingredient Cost (MAIC) program for generic pharmaceutical drugs. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 65 09/01/2023 The objective of the MAIC program is to establish upper limit generic ingredient reimbursement rates that encourage efficient purchasing while being responsive to marketplace drug pricing fluctu ations. The goals and objectives of the DHCS MAIC pharmacy rei mbursement program include, but are not limited to the following: Ensure MAIC rates are set in accordance with WIC Section 14105. 45. Evaluate changes in drug product acquisition prices, the availability of generic drug products , brand drug loss of patent p rotection and update or establish MAIC rates as appropriate. Respond to changing circumstances in the drug marketplace that require action to MAIC rates including establishing, reviewing, adjusting , or suspending MAIC rates . Evaluate and respond to pharma cy provider MAIC rate inquiries based on current marketplace information , the provider's acquisition cost , and availability of the drug product. 4.6.3.2.1 MAIC Reimbursement Inquiry & Review Process The intent of the MAIC rate inquiry and review process is to evaluate if the current MAIC rate for a specific product is reflective of current marketplace conditions. The MAIC rate review will include an evaluation of product availability, drug shortages, changes in published pricing, and therapeutically equivalent generic products. The outcome of the MAIC rate review will be communicated to the provider and adjustments will be made to MAIC rates, as necessary. Providers with concerns about specific MAIC rates may request a review of an MAIC rate for a specific drug by submitting a request. Required information for the MAIC review includes , but is not limited to the following: NDC Drug name and strength Package size Wholesaler DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 66 09/01/2023 Lowest attainable package price Claim date of service Quantity dispensed Reimbursement amount Current MAIC rate Invoice The MAIC rate inquiry form can be found on the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal by selecting Forms & Information . All required fields on the MAIC rate review form must be completed. Providers will be contacted for supporting documentation or other information, as necessary. Providers can find MAIC rate lists on the Mercer Medi -Cal Rx website (https://ghscapps.mercer.com/capharmacy/MAIC -List). The Mercer Medi supports the Medi -Cal Rx MAIC program. 4.6.3.3 Federal Upper Limit (FUL) The FUL is an upper -limit of reimbursement for certain multiple -source drugs established independently from the California MAIC program by CMS. When a drug is listed on both the MAIC and FUL price lists, the maximum cost is the lower of the MAIC or FUL. FUL drugs and prices are available on the CMS website at www.medicaid.gov . 4.6.4 Situations of Medical Necessity When medically necessary for a specific member , approval of reimbursement at the NADAC or, if no NADAC, the WAC may be obtained for a product whose price exceeds the MAIC or FUL pri ce limits by requesting a Price Override PA from a Medi -Cal Rx consultant. Reimbursement of the prescription ingredient cost may require the use of a brand of a multiple -source drug and may not exceed the statutory reimbursement limits. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 67 09/01/2023 Note : The situation s of medical necessity price override does not apply to products classified as medical supplies or enteral nutrition products . 4.6.5 340B Pricing Program Provider's billing drugs purchased pursuant to the 340B program (covered entities and contract pharmac ies) are required to bill an amount not to exceed the entity's AAC plus dispensing fee for the drug. Providers will be reimbursed the lesser of the billed amount (AAC plus Professional Dispensing Fee) or the maximum rate permitted. 4.6.6 Sales Tax There is not a sales tax on prescriptions. 4.6.7 Compound Prescriptions The maximum reimbursement for compounded prescriptions is the total of ingredient costs allowed under Medi -Cal Rx reimbursement policy, professional fees, compounding , and sterilizatio n fees. Compounds may be submitted for all media types (POS, batch, web , or paper). Note : Medical supplies, diabetic supplies, enteral nutrition products, and blood factors may not be billed on a California Specific Compound Pharmacy Claim Form (30-4). The California Specific Pharmacy Claim Form ( 30-1) or UCF must be completed for non - compounded I.V. solutions. The (30-4) or UCF can be completed for compounded I.V. solutions or sterile transfers . 4.6.7.1 Compound (Injection/ Infusion ) Pricing Compound pricing for injections and infusion s (Ingredients + Compound Fee + Sterilization Fee + Professional Dispensing Fee) are calc ulated as follows : Ingredient Cost = The sum of all the ingredients used in the compound. For each ingredient, the system -determined price quantity billed is multiplied by the applicable unit price for the price type in the appropriate algorithm. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 68 09/01/2023 Each ingr edient is calculated separately to determine whether the billed amount on the claim ( i.e., Gross Amount Due ( GAD)) or the system -determined price is the lesser of value ; the lesser of value is then used. Compounding Fee = The Container Count multiplied by a designated compounding fee for the given Route of Administration ( ROA) (or Dosage Form, if applicable ). The compounding fee must be billed in the \"other amount claimed field \" on the claim in order to receive reimburse ment for a compounding fee. In addition , the Medi -Cal Rx vendor will evaluate the billed compounding fee to the calculated compounding fee and pay the lesser of. Injection (as defined by ROA Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine ( SNOMED ) value = 424109004 , 385218009 (Injection)) compounding fee is $0.99 per container, with a maximum of 20 containers. Infusion (as defined by ROA SNOMED value = 424494004, C444364 , XXX) compounding fee is $0.99 per container, with a maximum of 20 containers without a PA. Note : If a claim is submitted with greater than 20 containers on the claim, the claim will deny Reject Code 76 - Plan Limitations Exceeded . A PA can be submitted for an override. Compounding fees and/or maximum containers may vary for a given timeframe. Note : An approved PA may override the allowed number of containers used in the calculation. If the ROA's compounding fee per container is equal to zero, then an alternate method of determining the compounding fee must be based on the Dosage Form . Refer to Section 4.6.7.3 - Compounding Fee Breakdown by Dosage Form for additional information on Compounding Fees. Dosage Form's compounding fees are based on low-end and high -end ranges that vary by dosage form. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 69 09/01/2023 Any compound claim billed which contain s only the dummy NDC for containers, 99999999997 , will be denied with Reject Code 7Z - Compound Requires Two or More Ingredients with supplemental message \" Compounds with container NDC must also include at least one active compounded ingredient. \" Sterilization Fee = The lowest amount between the billed Incentive Amount or the system -determined Sterilization Fee (using th e following formula ): Injection (as defined by ROA SNOMED value = 424109004, 385218009, XXX, XXX (Injection) sterilization fee is $0.32 per container, with a maximum of 20 containers. Infusion (as defined by ROA SNOMED value = 424494006, C444364 , XXX ( Infusion) sterilization fee is $0.32 per container, with a maximum of 20 containers. If a claim is submitted with greater than 20 containers on the claim, the claim will deny Reject Code 76 - Plan Limitations Exceeded . Sterilization fees and/or maximum containers may vary for a given timeframe. The sterilization fees must be billed in the \"incentive fee field\" on the claim in order to receive reimbursement for the sterilization fee. In addition, th e Medi -Cal Rx vendor will evaluate the billed sterilization fee to the calculated sterilization fee and pay the lesser of. Professional Dispensing Fee = Professional Dispensing Fee (defined in Section 4.6.2 - Professional Dispensing Fee ) multiplied by Container Count, with a maximum of 20 containers. Note : Professional Dispensing Fees and/or maximum containers may vary for a given timeframe. Note : Prior to April 1, 2017, the professional dispensing fee applied to compounds was a flat rate that varied based on place of services. 4.6.7.2 Compound (Non -Injection/Non -Infusion ) Pricing Non-Injection/Non -Infusion compound pricing (Ingredients + Compounding Fee + Sterilization Fee + Professional Dispensing Fee) are calculated as follows : DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 70 09/01/2023 Ingredient Cost = The sum of all the Ingredients used in the Compound. For each ingredient, the system -determined price quantity billed is multiplied by the applicable unit price for the price type in the appropriate algorithm. Each ingredient is calculated separately to determine whether the billed amount on the claim (i.e., GAD) or the system -determined price is the lesser of value : the lesser of value is then used. Compound Fee = The Container Count of 1 ( regardless of what is included on the claim as the container count) multiplied by a designated compounding fee for the given ROA (or Dosage Form, if applicable) . Nasal (as defined by ROA SNOMED value = ) compounding fee per container. defined by ROA SNOMED value = 54485002 (Ophthalmic)) compounding fee is $2.04 per container. Otic (as defined as ROA SNOMED value = 1054007 (Otic)) Intr aperitoneal, Irrigation, Urethral, Vaginal, Enteral (as the ROA) is determined by the Dosage Form. The compounding fee must be billed in the \"other amount claimed field\" on the claim in order to receive reimbursement for a compounding fee. In addition, the Medi -Cal Rx vendor will evaluate the billed compounding fe e to the calculated compounding fee and pay lesser of. Any compound claim billed which contains only the dummy N DC for containers, 99999999997 , will be denied with Reject Code 7Z - Compound Requires Two or More Ingredients with supplemental message \" Compou nds with container NDC must also include at least one active compounded ingredient.\" Compounding fees and/or maximum containers may vary for a given timeframe. Dosage Form's Compounding Fees are based on low-end and high -end ranges that vary by the dosage form. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 71 09/01/2023 Sterilization Fee = Lowest amount between the billed Incentive Amount or the system - determined Sterilization Fee , using the following formula: System -determined Sterilization Fee = Container Count of 1 ( regardless of what is included on claim as the container count) multiplied by a designated sterilization fee for the given ROA. Intraperitoneal (as defined by ROA SNOMED value = 38239002 (Intraperitoneal ) sterilization fee is $0.32 per container. Irrigation (as defined by ROA SNOMED value = 47056001 (Irrigation ) sterilization fee is $0.32 per container. Mucous membrane (as defined by ROA SNOMED value = 419874009 (Mucous membrane )) sterilization fee $0.32 per container. defined by ROA SNOMED value = 54485002 (Ophthalmic ) sterilization fee per container. by ROA SNOMED value = 90028008 (Urethral )) sterilization fee is $0.32 per container. Remaining Non -Injection/ Infusion Compound s (Buccal, Dental, Inhalation, Mouth throat, Nasal, Oral, Other miscellaneous Otic, Rectal, Sublingual, Topical, Transdermal, Translingual, Vaginal, Enteral) sterilization fee is $0.00. Sterilization fees and/or maximum containers may vary for a given time frame.

DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 85 09/01/2023 5.0 Medi -Cal Rx Provider Claim Appeal Processes A claim appeal is the final step in the administrative process. The appeal process offers Medi -Cal Rx providers a method for resolving problems related to their claim disputes. Each claim will be reviewed on its own merit, using applicable history files and documentation that the provider presents with the appeal, which will allow a fair decision to be rendered. The Medi -Cal Rx Provider Claim Appeal process is o nly applicable to pharmacy fee-for- service claims processed by Medi -Cal Rx or by CA -MMIS. 5.1 Preparing a Claim Appeal An appeal must be submitted on a Medi -Cal Rx Provider Claim Appeal Form (DHCS 6571) (see Section 19.5 - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Claim Appeal Form (DHCS 6571) for additional information). The form can be found on the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal by selecting Forms & Information . Resubmission, underpayment, and overpayment requests for the same member may be combined on one form. However, each appeal should include only one member . The provider must identify the claim(s) involved and specificall y describe the disputed action or inaction regarding each claim. The Medi -Cal Rx Provider Claim Appeal Form (DHCS 6571) can be mailed to the Medi -Cal Rx Claims Department (see Appendix B - Directory for the mailing address). Providers may file a second appeal within 90 days from the initial appeal if the following apply: The Medi -Cal Rx Claim Appeal Team fails to act. The Medi -Cal Rx Appeal Acknowledgement Letter has not been sent from the Medi -Cal Rx Claim Appeal Team within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the appeal. The provider is dissatisfied with the action taken by the Medi -Cal Rx Claim Appeal Team regarding that appeal. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 86 09/01/2023 The Medi -Cal Rx Claim Appeal Team accepts appeals related to pharmacy claim processing issues only. Appeals for Medi -Cal Rx -related items that do not pertain to pharmacy claim processing (such as member eligibility determination and provider enrollment) mu st be submitted to the appropriate state or county department. 5.2 Claim Appeal Timeliness 5.2.1 90-Day Deadline Providers must submit an appeal within 90 days of the action/inaction precipitating the complaint. Failure to submit an appeal within this 90 -day time period will result in the appeal being denied.

Crossover - There was a Medi -Cal Rx crossover claim denial, overpayment, or underpayment. Adjustment Request - There was a Medi -Cal Rx claim overpayment or underpayment. The above options are available in Part 3 - Appeal Reason of the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Claim Appeal Form (DHCS 6571) (see Section 19.5 - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Claim Appeal Form (DHCS 6571) for additional information on the form).

Each appeal must contain proof of timeliness. See Section 5.2 - Claim Appeal Timeliness and corresponding subsections for acceptable documentation to verify timely submission. Note : In cases where a CIF has been filed prior to an appeal, the provider has one (1) year from the date of the Medi -Cal Rx Claim Inquiry Acknowledgement Lette r to file an appeal if no action resulted from the CIF. The Medi -Cal Rx Claim Inquiry Acknowledgement Letter must be submitted with the appeal; if it is not, the 90 -day rule applies. If the 90 -day timeline is not met, the appeal is subject to denial. 5.5 Acknowledgeme nt of Appeal The Medi -Cal Rx Claim Appeal Team will acknowledge each appeal within 15 days of receipt and make a decision within 30 days of receipt. If a decision is not made within 30 days, the appeal is referred to the professional review unit for an add itional 30 days. If the appealed claim is approved for reprocessing, it will appear on a future RA as a claim (the claim will be reprocessed using the same prescription number and member ID from the appeal request). The reprocessed claim will continue to b e subjected to Med-Cal Rx policy and claim processing criteria and could also be denied for a separate reason. Medi -Cal Rx will send a letter of explanation in response to each appealed claim. Providers who are dissatisfied with the decision may submit sub sequent appeals. In these cases, indicate the reason for appealing the decision in the Part 3 - Appeal DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 89 09/01/2023 Reason field of the form and attach a copy of the claim and any supporting documentation (including timeliness documentation). 5.6 Judicial Remedy: One -Year Limit Providers who are not satisfied with Medi -Cal Rx's decision after completing the appeal process may seek relief by judicial remedy not later than one year after the appeal decision.

Sanctioned Prescribers - If a prescriber is sanctioned, claims will reject with Reject Code A1 - ID Submitted Associated with a Sanctioned Prescriber with the additional message \"Prescriber is Sanctioned. No clai ms allowed for Prescriber.\" DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 90 09/01/2023 7.0 Provider Procedure/Drug Code Limitation (P/DCL) In accordance with SB 857 and W&I Code, Section 14044, a Procedure/ Drug Code Limitation (P/DCL) may be imposed on a provider's use of one or more codes (CPT\u00ae, NDC , or HCPCS) for a period of up to 18 months, if one of the following conditions exists: DHCS determines, by audit or other investigation, that excessive services, billings , or abuse have occurred by a provider . A provider's licensing authority or a court of competent jurisdiction limits a licensee's practice of medicine, where the limitation precludes the licensee from performing services that could otherwise be reimbursed . A provider placed on P/DCL sanction will not be able to receive reimbursement for those service s under restriction. In addition, providers who fill orders for lab tests, drugs, medical supplies , or any other restricted services prescribed or ordered by a provider under restriction will not be reimbursed. The limitation becomes effective after DHCS g ives the provider notice of the proposed limitation and no appeal is submitted within 45 days or following the denial of an appeal. DHCS reviews provider appeal evidence and issues the appeal decision within 45 days of receipt. If the appeal is not granted , the code -use limitations become effective 15 days after provider notification. In a situation where the sanction could interfere with the provider's or other prescriber's ability to render health care services to a member , the burden to transfer the memb er's care to another qualified provider remains the responsibility of the provider. The P/DCL may be used separately or in tandem with other existing anti -fraud and abuse efforts. Specific information on procedure/drug code limitations will be added to thi s manual as it becomes available. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 91 09/01/2023 Pharmacy claims that are submitted where the prescriber is placed on a P/DCL sanction will deny with Reject Code 71 - Prescriber ID is Not Covered with the additional message \"Prescriber is sanctioned from prescribing certain or all drugs.\" Pharmacy claims that are submitted where the pharmacy is placed on a P/DCL sanction will deny with Reject Code 70 - Product/Service not covered with the additional message \" Pharmacy is sanctioned from dispensing certain o r all drugs.\" 8.0 Member Eligibility Member eligibility can be validated via several methods: CSC Nationwide Toll-Free Number: 1 -800-977-2273 Medi -Cal Rx Secured Provider Portal Once a provider has logged in, the Beneficiary Eligibility Look -Up tool will be available under Tools & Resources (see Section 3.6.1.2.4 - Additional Resources and Section 10.1.1.2 - Identifying Member's OHC via Beneficiary Eligibility Lookup Tool ). Eligibility Verification via N CPDP E1 Transaction Member Identification: Provider Obligations When a provider verifies that an individual is eligible to receive Medi -Cal Rx benefits, the provider is accepting the individual as a Medi -Cal Rx member . The provider is then bound by the rul es and regulations governing Medi -Cal Rx regarding that member . If the provider is unwilling to accept an individual as a Medi -Cal Rx member , the provider has no authority to access confidential eligibility information. Note : To receive reimbursement, the member must be eligible for Medi -Cal Rx fee-for- service on the DOS. This also applies to Medi -Cal Rx claims for members enrolled in CCS, GHPP , or Family PACT . DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 92 09/01/2023 8.1 Identification Numbers, Cards , and Claims 8.1.1 Beneficiary ID See Table 8.1.1 -1 for information regarding the format of both the BIC ID and HAP ID.

The BIC ID is on the member 's card and is 14 alpha -numeric characters. For claim submission, the pharmacy can submit the first 9 chara cters of the BIC ID, or the full 14 characters on the claim. Note : For p harmacies submitting claims for same -day, newly enrolled Medi -Cal members , the full 14 -character BIC ID must be entered on the claim for services rendered on the enrollment date. Altered ID Cards Medi -Cal Rx ID cards must not be altered by either the member or provider. If a member presents a card that is photocopied or contains erasures, strikeouts, white - outs, typeover , or any other form of alteration, provid ers should request that the member obtain an unaltered card and check other identification to ensure the patient is the Medi -Cal Rx member . Do not accept altered Medi -Cal Rx cards as proof of eligibility. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 93 09/01/2023 8.1.2 Beneficiary Identification Card (BIC) Each member is issued a Beneficiary Identification Card (BIC), which can be in one of the following formats: Plastic Benefits Identification Card Paper ID Card In exceptional situations , county welfare departments may issue temporary paper cards to individuals . 8.1.3 Health Access Program (HAP) Card Providers are furnished with plastic, prenumbered, teal -colored cards to distribute to members at the time of their first service so there i s no delay in care. Because a member 's HAP identification number is entered at a provider's site in real -time through the POS network, a provider can render services and submit a claim for reimbursement without delay. An activated plastic HAP card offers a ccess to program -specific medical, laboratory and pharmacy services by referral from the member 's physician.

DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 101 09/01/2023 A list of CCS covered medical conditions can be found on the following website: https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/ccs/Pages/medicaleligibility.aspx . Secondary to CCS Condition Conditions that are secondary to CCS conditions are interpreted as CCS conditions for the purposes of CCS policy. A PA will be required and will evaluate the secondary conditions for applicability to one or more CCS conditions. CCS Paneled Providers (Prescribers) \"Paneled Providers\" have been determined by the CCS progra m to meet the advanced educations, training, and/or experience requirements for their provider type in order to render services to a CCS applicant or member . Listings and files for \"Paneled Providers\" are available at https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/ccs/Pages/CCSProviders.aspx . 8.2.5.1.1 CCS Prior Authorization Requirements The following PA requirements apply for CCS -only or CCS/Medi -Cal members : CCS-only Policy : In order to provide the drugs/supplies that require a PA for CCS, a CCS paneled provider must prescribe it .

For additional information regarding PA submission methods see Section 14.0 - Prior Authorization Overview, Request Methods and Adjudication . For GHPP -only members , the prescriber does not have to be a CCS paneled provider and does not need to treat a CCS condition nor a GHPP condition., as GHPP provides comprehensive coverage (i.e., if an individual is enrolled in GHPP all services for that individual are covered, not just services for the GHPP condition) . Eligibility requires only that the member has a diagnosis of a GHPP eligible condition. A list of GHPP covered medical conditions can be found on the following website: https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/ghpp/Pages/MedicalEligibility.aspx . 8.2.5. 3 CCS Pro gram County Office Directory The CCS county office directory (https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/ccs/Pages/CountyOffices.aspx ) identifies the CCS county offices as dependent or i ndependent , and which state offices are responsible for the county providing their administrative oversight. The following guidelines may be helpful in selecting the correct office: For questions about eligibility, contact the CCS independent county offic e. For questions about eligibility (residential eligibility or financial questions) in dependent counties, contact the CCS dependent county office. 8.2.6 Managed Care Plans (MCPs) As of January 1, 2022 , Medi -Cal Rx has taken over the responsibility from Me di-Cal MCPs for administering the following when billed by a pharmacy on a pharmacy claim: Covered Outpatient Drugs, including PADs Certain Medical Supplies Enteral Nutrition Products DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 104 09/01/2023 The transition will not apply to PACE, Cal MediConnect, or SCAN.

When submitting claims for Medi -Cal Rx members who have retroactive el igibilit y and additional information is required, a paper claim form will be required in the same manner as for other late billings. Refer to Section 19.3.1 - Submission and Timeliness Instructions , and the Billing Limit Exceptions table within that section for more information. The provider has 60 days from the date of receipt of retroactive eligibility information to bill Medi -Cal Rx. Proof of eligibility must be received within one year from the month service was rendered. For information on identifying member eligibility , including retroactive eligibility, see Section 8.0 - Member Eligib ility. 8.2.8 Eligibility Service Restrictions Under federal and state law, Medi -Cal may place a member on restricted eligibility status. Members who meet the crite ria may have utilization restrictions. Medi -Cal Rx will return an error message notifying the provider of the restricted services and a PA is required. Prescription Drugs DHCS may restrict access to prescription drugs for members and may be subjected to one or more forms of utilization restrictions . These members receive a regular BIC , but when verifying eligibility, the Medi -Cal eligibility verification system will deny the claim with Reject Code 75 - Prior Authorization Require d and return a message stating \"Recipient has restricted services. Prior Authorization required for drugs.\" This restriction requires an approved PA for all DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 105 09/01/2023 nonemergency prescription drugs. California law stipulates that prescriptions and emergency room vi sits do not apply to a restricted member in any instance where a bona fide emergency exists which requires immediate treatment. This restriction requires an approved PA for all nonemergency prescription drugs. Retroactive paper ID cards for members with th is restriction will have the code \"P/A ALL RX.\" Scheduled Drugs DHCS may also restrict access to certain scheduled drugs. These members receive a regular BIC, but when verifying eligibility, the Medi -Cal Rx eligibility verification system will deny the claim with Reject Code 75 - Prior Authorization Required and return a message stating \"Recipient has restricted services. Prior Authorization required for scheduled drugs.\" This restriction requires an approved PA for all nonemergency prescriptio n drugs. Retroactive paper ID cards for members with this restriction will have the code \"P/A SCHRX.\" Note : Authorization is not required for nonscheduled drugs contained in the CDL (found on the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal by selecting Forms & Information ). DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Financial Responsib ilities 9.1 Copays Table 9.1 -1 below show s the standard copay for members . Standard Co pay Generic $0.00 Brand $0.00 Table 9.1 -1: Standard Co pays 9.2 Deductibles Table 9. 2-1 below show s the standard deductible for members . Description Standard Comments Deductible N/A Table 9.2 -1: Standard Deductible 9.3 Share of Cost (SOC) Some Medi -Cal members must pay, or agree to pay, a monthly dollar amount toward their medical expenses before they qualify for Medi -Cal Rx benefits. This dollar amount is called Share of Cost (SOC). A Medi -Cal SOC is similar to a private insurance plan's Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) deductible or can sometimes be referred to as a Spend Down. The SOC can and may change month to month. DHCS will track when SOC has been met. See Table 9.3 -1. Until the member has met the SOC, the claim will be denied for unmet share of cost (Reject Code AA - Patient spenddown not met ) with supplemental messaging advising of remaining SOC. However, once the member meets the SOC , the claim will then proceed to be processed per Medi -Cal Rx claim edits and audits . Pharmacy providers with questions regarding SOC, can call the Automated Eligibility Verification System (AEVS) at 1-800-456-AEVS (2387) or the Medi -Cal Telephone Service Center (TSC) at 1-800-541-5555 (Note : The TSC is different than the Medi -Cal Rx CSC) . DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 107 09/01/2023 For information on SOC and mechanisms on how to report spend -down, see the applicable links on SOC and on the Automated Eligibility Verification System (AEVS) in the DHCS Provider Manual (Part 1 ). Note : Beginning January 1, 2022 , Box #28 & Box 29 (Patient's Share) on the California Specific Pharmacy Claim Form (30 -1) and California Specific Compound Pharmacy Claim Form (30 -4), is not required and should be LEFT BLANK.

Table 9.5 -1: Patient Paid Amount DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 108 09/01/2023 10.0 Coordination of Benefits (COB) COB is the mechanism used to designate the order in which multiple carriers are responsible for benefit payments and prevention of duplicate payments. Other Health Coverage ( OHC ) refers to: An insurance plan or carrier A program A commercial carrier The plan or carrier can be: An individual A group Employer -related Self-insured A self-funded plan The program can be Medicare, which has liability for all or part of a member 's medical or pharmacy coverage. Not Considered to be OHC The following is a partial list of insurance that is not considered to be OHC: Personal injury and/or medical payment cov erage covered under automobile insurance Life insurance Workers' Compensation Homeowners insurance Umbrella insurance Accident insurance Income replacement insurance (for example, AFLAC \u00ae) DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 109 09/01/2023 The term \" Other Health Coverage\" (OHC) is used to mean any source ot her than Medicaid that has a financial obligation for health care coverage. Medi -Cal Rx is always the payer of last resort unless a member also has CA AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), Indian Health Services, or Veteran's Administration (VA) Services. This also applies to compounds. Online COB ( for example, cost-avoidance) is performed. COB edits will be applied when OHC exists for the member and claim date of service (DOS) . If a claim does not contain COB information for a member who has active OHC on file, the claim will deny with Reject Code 41 - Submit Bill to Other Processor or Primary Payer . 10.1 COB General Instructions Medi -Cal Rx is always the payer of last resort unless a member also has CA ADAP, Indian Health Services, or VA Services. The recipient is required to utilize their OHC prior to Medi -Cal Rx when the same service is available under the member 's private health coverage. If the member chooses to pursue services not cover ed by Medi -Cal Rx, Medi -Cal Rx will not assume liability for the cost of those services and claims will be denied with Reject Code 41 - Submit bill to other processor or primary payer . Note : If the Medi -Cal Rx eligibility verification system(s) indicate th at a member has OHC, but the member claims there is no OHC, advise the member to contact the county welfare eligibility worker. Pharmacy: Self -Certification for OHC Pharmacy providers may complete self -certification for OHC electronically or by using the UCF, California Specific Pharmacy Claim Form (30-1), and California Specific Compound Pharmacy Claim Form ( 30-4). Pharmacy providers do not need to submit an OHC attachment. However, pharmacy providers must be able to readily retrieve proof of claim submission and payment if collected from other payer(s). DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 110 09/01/2023 Electronic Self -Certification Electronic/online COB (for example, cost -avoidance) is performed when submitting claims via POS or Web Claims Submission. COB edits will be applied when OHC exists for the member and claim DOS. If a claim does not contain COB information for a member who has active OHC on file, the claim will deny with Reject Code 41 - Submit Bill to Other Processor or Primary Payer . Claim Form Self -Certification OHC will be self -certifie d for providers submitting paper claims if the Other Payer Amount Paid #1/#2 field(s) (Field 84/85 (UCF)), Other Coverage Paid field (Box 26 (30 -1) or Box 27 (30 -4)) and the Other Coverage (Field 45 (UCF)), or Other Coverage Code field (Box 27 (30 -1) or Bo x 28 (30 -4)) are completed as instructed in Section 19.1.1 - Completion Instructions for the Universal Claim Form , Section 19.2.1.1 - Completion Instructions for California Specific Pharmacy Claim Form ( 30-1), or Section 19.2.2.1 - Completion Instructions for California Specific Compou nd Pharmacy Claim Form (30 -4). 10.1.1 Identifying Other Health Coverage OHC can be identified using the POS system, the Medi-Cal Rx S ecured Provider Portal on the Medi -Cal Rx Web Portal under the Beneficiary Eligibility Lookup tool, or Medi -Cal's AEVS (see Section 3.5 - Automated Eligibility Verification System (AEVS) ). 10.1.1.1 Identifying Member 's OHC via POS Claims If a member has other coverage on a DOS and it is not reported on the pharmacy's claim submission, the Medi -Cal Rx vendor will deny the claim in the POS system (with Reject Code 41 - Submit Bill to Other Processor or Payer ) and return the Other Payer details of the active OHC on file in the \"COB Response Segment\": Other Payer Coverage Type Other Payer ID Qualifier Other Payer ID Other Payer Processor Control Number (PCN) Other Payer Cardholder ID DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 111 09/01/2023 Other Payer Group ID Other P ayer Person Code Other Payer Help Desk Phone Number Other Payer Patient Relationship Code Other Payer Benefit Effective Date Other Payer Benefit Termination Date Note : Items returned are subject to information received on the member 's COB records . Reimburs ement will be calculated to pay the lesser of the Medi -Cal Rx allowed amount less the third -party payment. 10.1.1.2 Identifying Member's OHC via Beneficiary Eligibility Lookup Tool The Beneficiary Eligibility Lookup tool is available to registered providers on the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal , also see Section 3.6.1.2 - Secured Provider Portal . Once a provider has successfully logged in, the Beneficiary Eligibility Lookup tool can be found under the Tools & Resources link. When the req uired member information has been entered (last name, BIC, birth date), providers will click Search . Upon a successful match being found, the member information along with their eligibility and claims history will be displayed, including OHC (see Appendix G - OHC Carrier Information for Medi -Cal OHC Carrier information pertaining to drug -related coverage. The table includes information on Other Payer IDs, Other Payer Names, and corresponding phone numbers). See Figure 10.1.1.2 -1. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx 10.1.1.2 -1: Beneficiary Eligibility Lookup Tool 10.1.2 Medicare Part B Coordination of Benefits Claims Some Medi -Cal members are eligible for services under the federal Medicare program. For most services rendered, Medicare requires a deductible and/or coinsurance that, in some instances, is paid for by Medi -Cal. The Medi -Cal Rx vendor will allow a POS claim (claim must be sub mitted with an Other Payer ID of \"444444\" to identify payment was received by Part B), for coinsurance but will also support paper claims to ensure that Medicare is responsible for their portion of claim payment. For Medicare/Medi -Cal Rx crossover claims f or Medicare -approved services that are not able to be billed at POS, the following paper claim forms can be utilized (see Section 19.1 - Universal Claim Form, Vers ion D.0 , Section 19.2.1 - California Specific Pharmacy Claim Form ( 30-1), and Section 19.2.2 - California Specific Compound Paper Claim Form ( 30-4)). Providers must submit crossover claims to the Medi -Cal Rx vendor (see Appendix B - Directory for mailing address). Note : Crossover claims do not require a PA request . Straight Medi -Cal Rx claims for Medicare denied or noncovered services may require a PA request . If a member has Medicare Part B coverage, and the pharmacy bills for a Medicare Part B covered drug or diabetic supply (including blood test strips, lancet/lancet devices, glucome ters, and control solution) , claims will deny with Reject Code A6 - DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 113 09/01/2023 Product/Service May Be Covered Under Medicare Part B with the supplemental message \" Bill Medicare. \" In the event the claim is billed to Medicare Part B and Medicare Part B denies the clai m for PA, a PA must be submitted to Medicare for coverage. If the PA is denied by Medicare, then a PA request may be submitted to Medi -Cal Rx for consideration. Full charges for a Medicare Part B eligible drug when the Medicare Part B annual deductible has NOT been met: If Medicare Part B denied payment on the claim and the charge was applied to member 's Medicare Part B annual deductible, and all required fields have been entered according to the NCPDP Standard Payer Sheet (see Appendix A - NCPDP Standard Payer Sheet ) then the claim will pay . If the claim is not covered by Medicare Part B, it should be billed to the member 's Medicare Part D. In this scenario, the claim billed to Medicare Part B will deny with Reject Code 13 - M/I Other Coverage Code with the supplemental message \"Bill Beneficiaries Part D Plan for payment.\" Copay charges for a Medicare Part B eligible drug when the Medicare Part B annual deductible has been met: If the claim does not crossover automatically to the MCP or fee-for-service Medi -Cal, the pharmacy must submit the claim for the copay charge for a Medicare Part B eligible drug to Medi -Cal Rx using the specific Medicare Part B Other Payer ID (\"444444\"), the applicable Other Coverage Code (OCC), and the dollar amount collected. Note : Medi -Cal Rx payment is based upon the Medi -Cal Rx allowable amount, minus any payment a pharmacy provider has received from Medicare and from private insurance and member SOC. California law limits Medi -Cal Rx's reimbursement for a crossover claim to an amount that, when combined with the Medicare payment, should not exceed Medi -Cal Rx's maximum allowed for similar services. (Refer to W&I Code, Section 14109.5.) DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider ( Charpentier \u00e9 [Coye/Kizer ]) filed December , allows providers to rebill Medi -Cal Rx for supplemental payment for Medicare/ Medi -Cal Part B services, excluding physici an and laboratory services. This supplemental payment applies to Medi -Cal fee -for-service crossover claims when Medi -Cal Rx's allowed rates or quantity limitations exceed the Medicare allowed amount. This applies only to Part B services billed to Part B carriers. All Charpentier rebills for pharmacy claims must be submitted via a paper claim form. The following definitions apply to Charpentier rebills (see Section 19.3.3 - Tips fo r Billing Charpentier Claims for how and where to utilize the following indicators) : Rates (R) - The Medi -Cal Rx allowed amount for the item or service exceeds the Medicare allowed amount. Benefit Limitation (L) - The quantity of the item or service is cut back by Medicare due to a benefit limitation. Both Rates and Benefit Limitation (T) - Both the Medi -Cal Rx allowed amount for the item or service exceeds the Medicare allowed amount and the quantity of the item or service is cut back by Medicare due to a benefit limitation. All Charpentier rebilled claims must have been first processed as Medicare/ Medi -Cal crossove r claims. Medicare Allowed Amount If there is no price on file, Medi -Cal Rx adopts the Medicare allowed amount and a cutback is not reflected on the RA. Exceeds Medicare's Allowed Amount If Medi -Cal Rx's rates and/or limitations are greater than that of M edicare, rebill the claim by following Charpentier billing instructions and attaching appropriate pricing documentation. Note : Do not use a Claims Inquiry Form (CIF) to rebill a Charpentier claim. DHCS - Medi -Cal Provider Where to Submit Charpentier Rebills All Charpentier rebills for pharmacy claims must be submitted via a paper claim form (refer to Section 19.0 - Claim Forms and Section 19.3.3 - Tips for Billing Charpentier Claims for additional information) and mailed to the Medi -Cal Rx vendor (see Appendix B - Directory for mailing address). Submission Requirements Providers must use the following submission requirements to be considered for supplemental payment under the Charpentier injunction: Providers must first bill Medicare and any Other Health Coverage (OHC) to which the member is entitled. The claim must then be billed as a crossover and approved by Medi -Cal Rx. This can happen one of two ways: The claim may cross over automatically from the Part B carrier (via POS/ electronic submission) . The crossover claim may be hard copy billed (paper claim) to Medi -Cal by the provider. Additional billing tips for Charpentier claims A Charpentier rebill must not be combined with a crossover claim. Use of Charpentier indicators (\"R,\" \"L,\" or \"T\") on claims that are not Charpentier claims will result in processing delays. Failure to place a Charpentier indicator (\"R,\" \"L,\" or \"T\") on a legitimate Charpentier claim prevents the system from recognizing the claim as a Charpentier rebill which may result in processing delays or denial of the claim. Claims with incorrectly marked Medicare Remittance Notices (MRN) will be denied. Providers must obtain an approved PA if a PA would be required when billed as a Medi -Cal Rx only claim. Providers are not required to submit a copy of the Medicare Appeal and Decision form when billing Medi -Cal Rx for the difference b etween Medicare and Medi -Cal. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 116 09/01/2023 10.1.4 Medicare Part D COB The Medi -Cal Rx vendor will deny COB claims where the pharmacy indicates by submission of OCC codes = 2 ( Other Coverage Exists Payment Collected ) that a payment has been received from Medicare Part D. The Medi -Cal Rx vendor will also deny COB claims where the pharmacy submits an OCC code = 4 ( Other Coverage Exists Payment Not Collected ) to indicate that Medicare Part D did not deny the claim, but there was no payment received from Medicare Part D. Both of these claim scenarios will deny for Reject Code 13 - M/I Other Coverage Code with the supplemental message \"Medicare Part D copays an d deductibles are not covered.\" Medi -Cal Rx will adjudicate claims for products that are not covered by Part D for members that have Medicare Part D. These products may pay if covered under Medi -Cal Rx. These products can be billed directly to Medi -Cal Rx without COB information. Claims submitted to Medi -Cal Rx for products that are not excluded from Medicare Part D for a member with Medicare Part D coverage, will deny with Reject Code 620 - This Prod/Service may be covered under Medicare Part D. Medi -Cal Rx will not pay the Medicare Part D medication deductibles or copayments. 10.1.4.1 Medicare and OHC When a member has both Medicare and OHC, the pharmacy provider must bill payers in the following order: 1. OHC carrier 2. Medicare for Medicare -covered services 3. Medi -Cal Rx DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 117 09/01/2023 10.1.5 Allowed Other Coverage Codes (OCC ) for Standard OHC and Medicare Part D See Table 10.1.5 -1 for the allowed OCC for standard OHC and Medicare Part D.

DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 149 09/01/2023 There are several ways to submit a PA request for review. Medi -Cal Rx will accept PA requests via the following methods: NCPDP P4 - Request Only Medi -Cal Rx Provid er Portal CoverMyMeds \u00ae Fax United States (US) Mail Note : Phone PAs are not allowed. A member cannot initiate a PA. The Medi -Cal Rx provider community will be able to access the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal and perform the following tasks: Retrieve a copy of the designated Medi -Cal Rx PA form. Access to a link to submit a PA electronically through the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal . Access a link to CoverMyMeds \u00ae for an option to submit an electronic PA (ePA). Access the fax number and US mailing address. 14.2 NCPDP Prior Authorization (P -type) Tra nsactions The following subsections provide a brief overview of the allowable NCPDP Prior Authorization (P -Type) transactions. For information regarding reject code required fields, refer to Appendix A - NCPDP Standard Payer Sheet . 14.2.1 P2 Transaction - PA Reversal Pharmacy providers can submit a P2 - PA Reversal to back out a request for authorization. The P2 will not reverse any claims submitted against the PA. Paid billings should be reversed before the PA is reversed. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 150 09/01/2023 14.2.2 P3 Transaction - PA Inquiry A pharmacy can submit a P3 - PA Inquiry to receive a status on a previously submitted P1 transaction or a P4 (PA Re quest Only ). 14.2.3 P4 Transaction - PA Request Only P4 transactions are submitted directly from the pharmacy using the NCPDP layout and required fields. The pharmacy can request and submit a PA on behalf of the member or provider. 14.3 Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal for Electronic Prior Authorization (ePA) The Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal will provide the ability for a prescriber's office or pharmacy to submit an electronic transaction and PA request (previously known as an eTAR). Submission via the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal has a pred efined intake form and utilizes the same edits that are stipulated around requirements for the above - mentioned P4 NCPDP record. The portal will display PAs requiring additional information. The submitter will have an option to submit the additional informa tion via fax or via the portal. Note : A link to CoverMyMeds\u00ae and to the Medi -Cal Rx vendor's PA fax form will also be available on the Provider Portal. 14.4 CoverMyMeds\u00ae ePA Submissions Medi -Cal Rx's prescriber community can submit an electronic web PA request utilizing the CoverMyMeds \u00ae platform. CoverMyMeds \u00ae can be accessed at www.covermymeds.com . Note : Only a prescriber can submit a completed PA case directly through CoverMyMeds \u00ae. Some pharmacies can initiate a request through CoverMyMeds \u00ae, which provides the information included in the case initiation to the prescriber. DHCS - Medi -Cal vendor's POS claims processing syste m and with the Medi -Cal Rx vendor's Clinical Decision Module (CDM) to present covered alternatives and to collect required clinical information from the prescriber. Note : The CDM will produce a series of questions related to the clinical criteria required for determination on a PA request. The CDM incorporates lists of drugs requiring a PA with alternatives that do not require authorization, diagnostic information, age and gender considerations, or quantity limitations. The CDM also enhances the ability to determine whether medical necessity has been met and is built using clinically based guidelines where Medi -Cal Rx policy will take precedence. Dependent on the answers to the CDM questions with which the Provider responds, the request can be approved in real -time or routed to a Medi -Cal Rx Clinical Pharmacist who is presented with all appropriate information in order to efficiently make a decision or recommendation. 14.5 Fax PA Submissions The Medi -Cal Rx vendor will accept PA requests that a re received by fax. Faxed requests must be submitted on one of the following forms (see Appendix E - Acceptable Medi -Cal Rx PA Request Forms ): Medi -Cal Rx PA Request Form (preferred) Medi -Cal Form 50 -1 Medi -Cal Form 50 -2 California Form 61 -211 The preferred Medi -Cal Rx PA Request Form will also be available on the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal under the Forms & Information link. Provider s may continue to utiliz e the Medi -Cal Form 50 -1, Medi -Cal Form 50 -2, and California Form 61 -211 after implementation of Medi -Cal Rx . Faxes can include any additional attachments (i.e., patient records or lab work) that the prescriber provides as medical justification for the request (all pages/attachments that a DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 152 09/01/2023 provider sends in a single fax transaction a re received together). Once the CSC reviews the document and a decision is made, a faxed response will be sent to the requestor. PA requests submitted by fax must be complete, legible, and include any relevant medical justification. If the fax submission is unsuccessful, the provider should double check that the fax number is correct. If after two attempts the fax is unsuccessful, the provider should contact the CSC by telephone (1 -800-977-2273) for further directions. Note : PA requests cannot be submitted via phone. PA Fax Number: 1-800-869-4325 14.6 US Mail The Medi -Cal Rx vendor will accept PA requests that are received by US Mail. Mailed requests must be submitted on one of the following forms (see Appendix E - Acceptable Medi -Cal Rx PA Request Forms ): Medi -Cal R x PA Request Form (preferred) Medi -Cal Form 50 -1 Medi -Cal Form 50 -2 California Form 61 -211 The preferred Medi -Cal Rx PA Request Form will also be available on the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal under the Forms & Information link. PA requests received by mail can include any additional attachments (i.e., patient records or lab work) that the prescriber provides as medical justification for the request. US Mail requests for PAs received by the Medi -Cal Rx vendor will be scanned by the mail room and placed into the fax queue. This allows mailed requests to be handled in the same manner and process as a faxed request for PAs. For paper submissions received via mail, the Medi -Cal Rx vendor will obtain the fa x number of the requestor to provide the documented outcome. If the requestor does DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 153 09/01/2023 not have a fax number, the CSC will call the requesting provider with the outcome and mail the written confirmation. Providers opting to mail PA requests can send their pape rwork to the Medi -Cal Rx vendor (see Appendix B - Directory for the mailing address) . 14.7 PA Adjudication The following process describes the steps that are taken to make a determination regarding a PA request: The Medi -Cal Rx vendor first determines eligibility and program coverage by editing against member eligibility factors, including: Program eligibility LTC status Existence of authorized prescribers Existence of program coverage restrictions, as well as other elements specified and approved by the DHCS. Once the initial PA is received and reviewed, the Medi -Cal Rx vendor will determine if additional information is needed. If yes, the PA will be deferred. The Medi -Cal Rx vendor will request the following information (also see \"Deferred\" bullet point below): If a fax number is available, the provider will receive a fax requesting the information needed, and the status of the PA will also be available via the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal for electronic submissions. If a fax number is not available and the request was submitted electronically, the status of the PA will be available via the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal . If a fax number is not available and the req uest was submitted via US Mail, an outbound call will be placed, and the status of the PA will also be available through the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal . DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 154 09/01/2023 Approval If the information furnished by the provider satisfies the criteria, an approval is logged, and the PA is sent to the POS system in real -time so that it is available for claim adjudication. The authorization will be approved for an appropriate duration bas ed on medical necessity and DHCS guidelines. A fax and/or correspondence via the submission method will be sent to the requesting provider to inform them of the PA approval. Modifications If a request is modified from the original request (strength, quanti ty, dosage form, etc.) by a Medi -Cal Rx vendor's or DHCS pharmacist and then approved as changed, it is considered \"modified.\" Note : This is different than a Change in Therapy, which is when a provider elects to prescribe an alternate medication that does not require a PA and essentially withdraws the PA request. A Modification will generate a Notice of Action (NOA) to the requesting provider and member . Deferred If additional information is needed, the case will be deferred, and the provider will be given the reason for the deferral. The case will be in a deferred status for up to 30 days. The reason for deferral will be faxed to the requesting provider indicating the case status. If fax is not available, a letter will be mailed. At the end of the 30 days, if no additional information is provided, an NOA will be sent to the requesting provider, authorized representative (if applicable), and member indicating a denial . Denial If the clinical information received does not meet medical necessity and a denial is recommended following review by a Medi -Cal Rx pharmacist, a DHCS Manual 155 09/01/2023 Pharmacist will review the case and make the final determination regarding whether the PA will be approved or denied. Note : If the authorization is denied or modified, the Medi -Cal Rx vendor will notify the provider and mail appropriate notice to the member within 3 business days. PA Appeals The Medi -Cal Rx vendor will review claims history and all past clinical information and will also review new da ta submitted with the appeal. Providers have 180 days to submit an appeal from the date of the initial denial. If the 180 th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the final date to submit the appeal will be the next business day. Provider PA appeals will be accepted via the Provider Portal and via paper by Fax or US mail and must be explicitly noted as an appeal by stating the word \"Appeal,\" or by the provider selecting the appeal option via Provider Portal submission. Refer to Appendix B - Directory for mailing address and fax numbers to submit a provider PA appeal. Provider appeal requests must contain the date or service being appealed, the reason the appeal should be granted, and any additional documentation to support the appeal. Unless specifically noted as an appeal per the directions above, a second PA submitted for a previously denied request is treated as a new initial review. Appeal Acknowledgement correspondence will be sent to the provider via fax or mail (when fax is unavailable) within one (1) calendar day of an appeal request. The turnaround time is 60 days for a PA appeal. Note : The Medi -Cal Rx vendor will send NOA lette rs to the provider, member , and authorized representative (when applicable) within three (3) business days from the date of the action requiring a letter. While under review, Medi -Cal providers will be able to communicate with the Medi -Cal Rx staff and ac cess the Medi -Cal Rx vendor's electronic environment via a secure portal to assist with and resolve clinical pharmacy -related issues, including DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx 09/01/2023 questions/concerns regarding Medi -Cal Rx timelines and decisions related to pending PA requests. 15.0 Program Sp ecifications 15.1 Limitations 15.1.1 Dispens ing Quantity Limitations Refer to the following table for information on DHCS' days supply dispensing policies and refill limitations.

Table 15.1.3 -1: Maximum Quantity Per Day Limit(s) New -Start and Subsequent Fill(s) Claims submitted for subsequent fill(s) for opioids will be restricted to the following maximum quantities per fill shown in Table 15.1. 3-2: Maximum Quantity Per Fill Subsequent Fill(s) Dosage Form Allowable Per Fill Limit Solid Oral - Immediate Release 120 each Solid Oral - Extended Release 90 each Oral Liquid s 180 mL Parenteral s 100 mL Transdermal Dosage Forms 10 each Note : These limits do not apply to buprenorphine products. Table 15.1.3 -2: Maximum Quantity Per Fill Subsequent Fill(s) As of October 1, 2019, DHCS will utilize current CDC guidelines to establish a maximum Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME) at which the POS system will return a message to the pharmacy provider, notifying the provider of the excessive dose risk. A warning message will be returned to providers when 90 MME threshold has been exceeded. The DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 161 09/01/2023 message will provide a warning of CDC recommendation for maximum MME. When 500 MME has been exceeded, the claim will deny and require a PA. The established MME thresholds wi ll apply cumulatively, across all concurrent opioid prescriptions, allowing refill variance(s) equal to an Early Refill (ER) tolerance of 90 percent , indicated by a number of days (for example, 90 percent is 3 days early on a 30 days supply). Note : New-start is defined as the absence of paid claims for opioids in the past 90 days prior to the current claim's DOS (cough preparations containing opioids are excluded from this look back). Chronic use is defined as the presence of 90 days of any opioid therapy (including long -acting, short -acting, and buprenorphine products) in the past 120-day period. The submission of DUR codes (see the Prospective DUR link on the Drug Use Review page on the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal ) will not be allowed to override ER reject(s) for opioids . The above limitations, with the exception of the maximum quantity per day outlined in Table 15.1.3 -1 and the 90 percent refill threshold mentioned above, will not apply to the following members : In LTC facilities In hospice Receiving palliative or end -of-life care With a diagnosis of sickle -cell disease In treatment for active cancer -related pain 15.1.4 Benzodi azepine Limitations All new-start (the absence of any Benzodiazepine therapy in the past 90 days) Benzodiazepine claims will be limited to a maximum of a 30 days supply. Exemptions : Members with documented history or submitted diagnosis of seizure disorde rs. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 162 09/01/2023 15.2 Partial Fills Medi -Cal Rx will not accept partial fills. Claims submitted with the Dispensing Status code of 'P - Partial Fill' will deny for Reject Code RK - Partial Fill Transaction Not Supported . 15.3 Incremental Fills Required by CA AB1048, a single prescription for a DEA Schedule II drug may be filled in multiple increments on separate claims (known as an incremental fill) only if ALL of the following conditions are met: All incremental fills must be processed by the same pharmacy. Total quantity dispensed for all incremental fills must not exceed the total quantity prescribed by the prescriber. Any quantity remaining on the prescription after 30 days from the date prescribed cannot be filled. 15.4 Claims Processing Edi ts Once a claim has been submitted online by a pharmacy, the POS system will return a message to indicate the outcome. If the claim passes all edits, a PAID message will be returned with the allowed reimbursement amount. A claim that fails an edit(s) and i s REJECTED or DENIED will return with a reject code and message. Refer to Appendix D - NCPDP Reject Codes for a list of reject codes. Note : For paper claims that have been submitted and processed , the claim outcome will be visible via the POS system, Provider Portal , or on the RA. 15.5 Dispense as Written (DAW) Codes The Medi -Cal Rx vendor will accept the Dispense as Written (DAW) codes in Table 15.5 -1 below. DHCS will allow any DAW code to be submitted on the claim, but use of a DAW code will not override any claim edits (such as pricing or PA DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 163 09/01/2023 requirement(s)). For example, a PA may still be required when a brand name drug is prescribed.

Providers can request a PA, and if criteria have been met, a PA will be approved (this option will eliminate the need for a provider to call into the CSC for every fill for the drug/product within the approved PA time frame ). 15.7 Emergency Fills 15.7.1 Emergency Dispensing of 14-Day Supply Beginning February 6, 2022, d ispensing of a 14-day emergency supply of any medication for which delaying the dispensing would withhold a medically necessary service is permitted electronically and via paper claim without requirement for a PA . Electronically billed emergency drug dispensing claims will be limited to a 14-day supply and a limit of two fills in a 30 -day period for the same drug and dose, which will allow for members to have immediate access to medically necessary drugs in emergency situations . If the situation requires a larger supply to be dispensed, the provider must submit a paper claim for the service. All products are available provided they are benefits of the program, including those that require a PA or Code I approval. Any policy reject codes may be overridden for emergency purposes with the exception of any eligibility edits (including those with a SOC) and OHC reject codes. Unbreakable packages such as inha lers, vials, oral contraceptives, etc. will continue to be paid for the full package size even when the days supply exceeds 14 days. Pharmacy Emergency Dispensing is exempt from PA. The pharmacist shall self -certify the emergency existed in accordance with CCR, Title 22 Section 51056(c). Emergency DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 166 09/01/2023 fills will be subject to audits, and providers are required to retain documentation of the emergency circumstances for audit purposes. Note: For dates of service prior to February 6, 2022, electroni cally billed emergency drug dispensing claims were limited to a three -day supply and a limit of two fills in a 30-day period for the same drug and dose. Note: For POS processing of emergency fills , use the Level of Service field to indicate it is an emergency claim. 15.7.2 Emergency Dispensing for Out -of-State Providers PA is required for all out-of-state services, except for emergency services as defined in CCR Title 22, Section 51056 (c). 15.7.3 Protocol for Overriding Utilization Management (UM) During State of Emergency During a Federal, State o r locally declared state of emergency, DHCS may authorize providers to override specific claims edits. The authorization may apply to specific counties and/or specific populations as directed by DHCS. DHCS wi ll notify providers when state of emergency overrides are activated via the Medi -Cal Rx Web Portal , including any applicable restrictions. 15.8 Physician Administered Drugs (PADs) A Physician Administered Drug (PAD) is an outpatient drug that is typically administered to a member and billed by a health care provider in locations that include, but are not limited to, physician's offices, clinics, and hospitals, and are not self -administered by a member or caregiver. Without first obtaining an approved PA, pharmacies are not reimburse d by Medi -Cal Rx for either the cost of ingredients or the professional fee for drugs furnished to other medical providers to administer or dispense to members , with the exception of drugs listed on the Medi -Cal Rx Pharmacy Reimbursable Physician Administered Drugs list found on the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal by selecting Forms & Information . DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 167 09/01/2023 When billed by a pharmacy, PADs must be billed pursuant to claim field requirements provided in the Payer Specifications (see Appendix A - NCPDP Standard Payer S heet). If a drug is administered by a health care provider other than a pharmacist in a pharmacy setting, and not self -administered by the member or caregiver even if the drug is United States FDA -approved for self -administration, that drug would primarily be con sidered a medical benefit by merit of the administration by a medical provider. Therefore, the same policy pertaining to other non -self-administered drugs (that is, those not United States FDA -approved for self -administration) would be applicable in this s cenario. It should only be billed by a pharmacy provider if the same reasons previously documented for other PADs apply. Note : Drugs found in Appendix H - List of Physician Administered Drugs with Reject Code 816 will reject with Reject Code 816 - Pharmacy Benefit Exclusion, May Be Covered Under Patient's Medical Benefit . Drugs not listed on the Medi -Cal Rx Pharmacy Reimbursable Physician Administered Drugs list, or in Appendix H will reject with Reject Code 70 - Product/Service Not Covered . Claims that reject with Reject Code 70 must be billed to the member 's medical plan. Claims that reject with Reject Code 816 will return the following supplemental message: \" Pharmacy Drug Benefit Exclusion. Exception for pharmac y benefit approval may be considered via PA request. May be covered as a medical benefit.\" Claims should be submitted via the member 's medical insurance, but may, under some circumstances, be submitted to MediCal Rx for a PA review and determination. 15.9 Pharmacy Administered Immunizations/Vaccines California law authorizes pharmacists to administer immunizations (that are covered under the CDL (which can be found on the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal by selecting Forms & Information ) pursuant to a legal prescription, a protocol with a prescriber (Business and Professions Code [Bus & Prof Code] Section 4052), or pharmacist initiated pursuant to (Bus & Prof Code Section 4052.8 and CCR, Title 16, Section 1746.4). Pharm acy administered immunizations and vaccines are a Medi -Cal covered pharmacy benefit and a Medi -Cal covered medical benefit. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 168 09/01/2023 Pharmacies are reimbursed for vaccines in a similar method as other pharmacy claims (see Section 4.6.1 - Legend and Non -Legend Drugs for reimbursement information ). A professional dispensing fee is also paid for fee-for-service pharmacy reimbursement (see Section 4.6.2 - Professional Dispensing Fee ). Administration fees and Evaluation and Management services associated with initiating the prescription (Bus & Prof Code Section 4052.8 and CCR, Title 16, Section 1746.4) must be billed to eit her the MCP or fee-for-service Medi -Cal whichever is applicable. For fee-for-service Medi -Cal claims, see Section 15.12 - Pharmacist Services for billing instruction. Most vaccines are covered without prior authorization for Medi -Cal members 19 years of age and older. Medi -Cal members aged 18 years and younger are eligible for the Vaccine for Children's (VFC) Program. Pharmacies participating in the VFC program may be reimbursed for the administration only. Additional vaccine restrictions may be applicable and are listed in the CDL. Immunizations/ vaccines covered as a Medi -Cal Rx pharmacy benefit are found in the CDL, otherwise they are covered under the member 's medical benefit(s). 15.10 Intravenous or Intra -Arterial Solutions Simple Intravenous (IV) solutions are typically used for hydration therapy. Commercially available (non -compounded) solutions such as Normal Saline, Dextrose (up to 10 percent in Water) and Lactated Ringer's Solution , as well as commercially prepared solutions of potassium chloride in such solutions are included in this definition. Simple IV solutions should be billed using the product's NDC number. Parenteral Nutrition Solutions (TPN or Hyperalimentation) : These solutions are restricted to dispensing within 10 days following inpatient discharge from an acute care hospital when IV therapy with the same product was started before discharg e without prior authorization .

The pharmacy submits '0' zero in this field for a multi -ingredient compound. For compound segment transactions, the claim is rejected with the appropriate NCPDP response reject code and message if zero is not submitted as the Product ID. 4 A Submission Clarification Code value of \"8\" only allows a claim to continue processing if at least one ingredient is covered. Non approved labeler ingredients will process wit h the Submission Clarification Code (SCC) ; but only approved labeler ingredients are eligible for reimbursement. NDCs that require authorization will not receive a payment unless a provider resubmits the claim after an approved PA has been granted. Note : For compound claims where an ingredient in the compound also has a Code I restriction, both the SCC = 8 and a SCC = 7 will have to be billed on the same claim. Alternatively, p roviders have the option to submit the applicable ICD - 10 diagnosis code on the incoming claim to satisfy the Code I Restriction (see Section 11.1 - Code I Restrictions ). Providers may contact the CSC at 1-800-977-2273 for assistance regarding SCCs . 5 Pharmacies must transmit the same NDC numbers that are being used to dispense the medication. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 175 09/01/2023 # Description 6 All compounds must contain at least two ingredients. The Medi -Cal Rx vendor will accept up to 25 ingredients .

Compounds with container NDC must also include at least one active compounded ingredient.\" 8 Based on the submitted ingredient cost data per ingredient , if the total submitted ingredient cost on the claim is not equal to the sum of the ingredients' costs, the claim will deny. Example : A compound with two ingredients is submitted for a total claim cost of $50. Ingredient A has a submitted cost of $20 and Ingredient B h as a submitted claim cost of $10, the claim will deny because the sum of the submitted claim cost for both ingredients (A & B) tota led $30, but the total claim cost was indicated to be $50. 9 Multiple instances of an NDC within a compound will not be allowed. These claims will deny Reject Code 21 - M/I Product/Service ID with the supplemental message \"Duplicate compound ingredients are not allow ed.\" 10 Duplicate Edits are applied to compounds 11 For ProDUR processing , the compounds are matched on the number of ingredients and same ingredients. Excipient drugs are excluded from the comparison logic. Excipient Drugs/Products include: Sodium/Saline Preparations IV Solutions: Dextrose Cream bases DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 176 09/01/2023 # Description Ointment bases 12 SNOMED \u00ae is a required field for compounds - the route of administration is required - NCPDP # ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION (Field # 995 -E2) Note : If providers are submitting a Compound Claim Form (30-4), Box 48 ( Specific Details/Remarks) must have the SNOMED \u00ae value of the claim.

The mass claim adjustment process includes identifying the impacted claims by applying a predetermined set(s) of parameters, reversing them, and then reprocessing the transaction to correct the issue. Mass claim adjustment requests are initiated (typically by DHCS) for any one or more of the follow ing reasons: Drug Pricing Drug Coverage Provider Dispensing Fee Rates DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 178 09/01/2023 Share of Cost Eligibility COB 15.16 Electronic Prescrib ing (ePrescribing) Electronic Prescribing (ePrescribing) is the use of an automated data entry system to generate a prescription, replacing the use of handwritten prescriptions. Electronic prescriptions are computer -generated prescriptions created by the prescriber and sent directly to the member 's pharmacy of choice. ePrescribing applications that are certified by SureScripts (the industry leader in ePrescribing) , allow new prescription orders and refill authorizations from the prescriber to be sent directly to the computers of the selected pharmacies . 15.16 .1 ePrescribing Process Instead of writing the prescription on a piece of paper, the prescriber enters it directly into an automated data entry system to the pharmacy's computer using a private, secure , and closed network. The ePrescribing process eliminated the need for the member to take a hard copy of the prescript ion to the pharmacy, saving time and facilitating prescription accuracy. The Medi -Cal Rx vendor has contracted with SureScripts, the industry leading vendor for ePrescribing. General information on activated pharmacies with ePrescribing capabilities and that utiliz e SureScripts within California can be found at www.surescripts.com . Physicians interested in automating the prescribing process must utilize an ePrescribing or Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system that has been certified to connect to the Pharmacy Health Information Exchange, operated by SureScripts. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 179 09/01/2023 15.17 End of Life Option Act Services The End of Life Option Act is a California Law that permits terminally ill adult recipients with the capacity to make medical decisions to be prescribed an aid -in-dying medication if certain conditions are met. The law is outlined in California Health and Safety Code (H&S Code), Division 1, Part 1.85, Section 443. 15.17 .1 Pharmacy Billing for End of Life Option Act Services Medi -Cal Rx will not cover end of life services. End of life services claims submitted via the POS system, Universal Claim Form (UCF), California Specific Pharmacy Claim Form (30-1), or California Specific Compound Pharmacy Claim Form (30-4) are not permitted and will be denied. Pharmacies must bill for end of life services on the CMS-1500 claim form only. Providers can refer to the DHCS Provider Manual (Part 2) for additional information on the End of Life Services Act and billing information. 16.0 Drug Use Review (DUR) 16.1 DUR Program Overview Federal rules require that each state Medicaid program include a comprehensive Drug Use Review (DUR) program to improve the quality and cost effectiveness of drug us e by ensuring that prescriptions are appropriate, medically necessary, and not likely to result in adverse medical results. California's Medicaid DUR program is focused on outpatient medication therapies with the broad goals of improving patient outcomes, increasing the quality of prescribing practices, reducing healthcare costs, and improving member , prescriber , and pharmacist satisfaction. To work towards these goals, the DUR program implement s strategies that identify and reduce adverse events, fraud, mi suse, overutilization, underutilization , and inappropriate/ineffective care associated with specific drugs or groups of drugs. Strategies for improving presc ribing medications may include DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 180 09/01/2023 education, data reports, audits, alerts, incentives, decision -making tools, and outreach aimed at members , prescribers, and pharmacists. There are three key functions of the DUR program Prospective DUR Retrospective DUR Educational Outreach Information on the three functions above can be found on the Medi -Cal Rx Provider Portal by selecting Tools and Resources , and then selecting Drug U se Review . Central to the DUR program is the Global Medi -Cal DUR Board, which is an advisory board that includes volunteer pharmacists and physicians with active practices in California. The Board advises and makes recommendations to the State on common drug therapy problems ; develops criteria to evaluate and improve the quality of drug therapy, reviews, evaluations, and utilization reports ; and recommends educational interventions, as needed, in order to improve prescribing and dispensing practices. The DUR program promotes patient safety thro ugh state -administered utilization management tools and systems that interface with the claims processing systems. Additional, consiste nt with 42 CFR \u00a7438.3(s)(4) and (5), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS ). Note : Prospective (concurrent) DUR edits will apply to all real -time claim types (i.e., POS, Web). Edits will not apply to Paper and Batch claims. Also, p rior to 4/1/2021, claim adjudication would allow submission of only the major conflict code to satisfy all DUR conflict s on the claim.

Unacceptable Forms: Carbon copies, photocopies, computer -generated form facsimiles , or forms created on laser printers are not acceptable for the forms mentioned in this section. Pin-Fed Forms : Remove all perforated sides and separa te each indivi dual form. For accurate scanning, leave a \u00bc -inch border on the left and right side of the form after removing the perforated sides. Do Not Fold or Crease : To expedite the sorting and preparation of claims for scanning, do not fold or crease forms to fit in to small -sized envelopes. Enclose forms in full -sized envelopes. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 202 09/01/2023 Typed and Handwritten Forms: Type all information (using capital letters) on forms whenever possible for clarity and accuracy using 10 -point font or larger (not to exceed the size of the fie ld). Do not use script or italic font. Handwritten forms should be printed neatly and accurately using a ballpoint pen only. Do not use red pencils or red ink ballpoint pens. All requirements pertaining to typed forms, such as entering data within the tex t space, apply to handwritten forms. Printer Ribbons : Use black film -type or high -quality ribbons. Ribbons should be changed regularly to ensure that a clear, distinct character is printed. Frequently change the ink cartridges in the printer to avoid light ink. Blurred or light printing may be misread by the scanning equipment. Avoid printing claim forms using a dot matrix printer. Laser printers are strongly recommended.

Void - A request to repay monies on a previously paid claim. Share of Cost (SOC) - A claim has been paid at a different amount and a provider requests a reim bursement for SOC. Tracer - No record of payment of denial of a previously submitted claim exists on the Remittance Advice (RA) and the provider wants to trace the status of a claim. Crossover - A request for reconsideration of a denied Crossover claim or an underpaid or overpaid Crossover claim. Underpayment - Adjustment for an underpaid claim.

In many instances, the provider's goal is to retu rn funds. Void requests may be submitted at any time. Voids can be done via the Medi -Cal Rx POS or Web Claims Submission if the claim has a date of service on or after 10/01/2019. Providers requiring a void and subsequent resubmission of a corrected claim must use a two -step process. The CIF void must first be submitted to recoup the full payment. Once the void appears on a future RA, the provider completes the second step by submitting a corrected claim for processing. DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 274 09/01/2023 Note : If a provider submits a correc ted claim before the void has been processed, the claim may deny as a duplicate since the original claim has not yet completed the void process. 19.4.2.4 CIFs for Compound Claims A pharmacy compound claim with numerous ingredients is processed as one (1) l ine.

As a result, the Medicare adjus tment claim must be submitted in hard -copy form. Providers need to properly adjust the original claim submitted to Medicare and resubmit the adjusted claim to Medi -Cal Rx. Providers must also void (reverse) the original Medicare payment, or the adjusted claim will be denied due to a duplicate of a previously paid claim.

DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 296 09/01/2023 19.6.5 Reimbursemen t The reimbursement rate is the rate on file for the date of service. Enrollment Requirement To be reimbursed, the provider must have been enrolled as a Medi -Cal provider on the date of service.

DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Plan (PIP) Introduction The Medi -Cal Rx vendor is commit ted to its role in preventing and detecting health care Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA). The Medi -Cal Rx Program Integrity Plan (PIP) supports the Medi -Cal Rx vendor's commitment to enforce the highest standard of ethics, professional standards, and complian ce. The PIP and its standards apply to all employees and members of the Board of Directors, as well as contractors and subcontractors who must abide by and uphold internal policies, state and federal regulations, Medi -Cal Rx Contract requirements, and exte rnal laws that govern Medi -Cal Rx business PIP outlines the Medi -Cal Rx vendor's FWA program and mechanism to conduct the following: Monitor Measure Review, validate, refer , and report FWA to DHCS. The Medi -Cal Rx vendor integrate s the PIP into all Operational processes to ensure consistent application of FWA controls and reporting . The Medi -Cal Rx vendor also has responsibility in engaging the Problem Correction Process (PCP), Change Management, and other external process es. All employees are required to complete training regarding the PIP and attest that the PIP has been read and understood within the first 30 days of hire and annually thereafter. 20.2 What are FWA and Overpayment? In order to detect FWA, you need to familiarize yourselves with what each of these terms mean and understand how potential concerns can be identified through your day-to-day activities. Fraud - An intentional deception or misrepresentation made by a person with the knowledge that the deception results in unauthorized benefit to herself or himself or DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 298 09/01/2023 another person. The term includes any act that constitutes fraud under applicable federal or state law. Waste - Mismanagement of resources, including incurring unnecessary costs because of inefficient or ineffective practices or systems. Abuse - Provider and pharmacy practices that are inconsistent with generally accepted business or medical practices that result in an unnecessary cost to the Medi -Cal Rx program or in reimbursement for medications that are not medically necessary or that fail to meet professionally recognized standards for health care, or member practices that result in unnecessary cost to the Medi -Cal Rx program. Overpayment - Includes any amoun t not authorized to be paid by the Medi -Cal Rx program whether paid as a result of inaccurate or improper cost reporting, improper claiming, unacceptable practices, fraud, abuse, or mistake. 20.3 Difference Between and Indicators of Potential FWA There ar e differences between fraud, waste , and abuse. One of the primary dif ferences is intent and knowledge. Fraud requires the person to have the intent ion to obtain payment and the knowledge that their actions are wrong. Waste and Abuse may involve obtaining an improper payment but do not require the same intent and knowledge. Now that you know what FWA are, you need to be able to recognize the signs of someone committing FWA. Here are some examples of what to look for: Potential Member Issues Does the prescription look altered or possibly forged? Does the member have multiple prescriptions for the same medication? Is the prescription appropriate based on t he member 's other prescriptions? Does the member 's medical history support the services being requested? Is the member traveling a long distance to get their prescription? Does the individual providing the clinical information for the prior authorization appear to have a clinical background? DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 299 09/01/2023 Potential Provider Issues Does the provider write for diverse drugs or primarily only for controlled substances? Are the provider's prescriptions appropriate for the member's health condition (medically necessary)? Is the provider writing for a higher quantity than medically necessary for the condition? Are multiple members of the same family getting the same prescription from the same doctor? Potential Pharmacy Issues Do you see prescriptions being altered (changing qua ntities or Dispense as Written ?) Are generics provided when the prescription requires that brand be dispensed? Are all members receiving the same or similar combinations of drugs? Is the pharmacy consistently billing for higher than the recommended dosage? Are all of the pharmacy's prescriptions written by one or a few prescribers? Is the pharmacy located far away from the patient or prescriber? Is the pharmacy using or abusing indicator codes ( for example , pregnancy indicator for a male member , emergency indicator codes, etc.)? Do all members have the same diagnosis code when a diagnosis code is required? The sample scenarios provided above may result in member calls, which might include questions, such as the following: Q: Why did I receive a Notice of Action (NOA) letter for a denied prescription for a medication that I am not taking? Q: Why was my prescription denied for early refill when I have not refilled it? You may also receive calls from individual s who wish to remain anonymous and/or individuals who are only calling to report suspected FWA. These callers should be provided the phone number for the Prime Therapeutics Compliance Hotline DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 300 09/01/2023 (1-800-474-8651 ), and you should ask if you can transfer the caller to that number.

What Providers Need to Know About Medical Supplies and Enteral Nutrition Products: Specific covered products are billed and provided through Medi -Cal Rx as pharmacy -billed benefits. Specific products are restricted to the Covered Products Lists . For products on the Covered Products Lists and restricted to specific NDC/billing codes, a PA request will not override a contracted NDC/billing code and will not allow a noncontracted product to be substituted. For enteral nutrition products throu gh July 1, 2022, substitution has temporarily been allowed without the need for a new prescription from the prescriber. This policy will remain in place until the national supply of infant formulary stabilizes. Prior to the Department removing this substit ution without a PA policy in the future, a 90-day notice will be published, allowing substantial notification to providers and stakeholders. Product coverage is restricted to the Covered Products Lists. For more detailed information, refer to the following : Covered Products Lists tab on the Forms & Information page Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual Enteral Nutrition Update: Temporary In terchange of Equivalent Contracted Enteral Nutrition Products Due to Recent Formula Recall Enteral Nutrition Update: Interchange of Equivalent Contracted Enteral Nutrition Product and Specialty Infant Authorization Term Limit What Providers Need to Do to Request Alternative Medical Supplies an d Enteral Nutrition Products: Providers who encounter out -of-stock products for covered benefits and specific to a Covered Products Lists or medical supplies category should immediately contact DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 302 09/01/2023 the CSC at 1 -800-977-2273. The CSC is available 24 hours a day , 7 days a week, 365 days per year . Providers should have the following information ready: Product NDC/billing code Product name Product category (diabetic test strips, condoms, aerochambers, etc.) Documentation, such as manufacturer documentation or a wholesaler/distributor invoice, demonstrating the product is unavailable from any other source and they have attempted to locate the product Documentation of the alternative product the provider would like to use Provider contact information, Rx number, Nat ional Provider Identifier number, and member information MMA and DHCS will review the request and respond as soon as administratively possible. Drug Products Prior to requesting an alternative, providers must: 1. Confirm that other pharmacies (or locations of a chain pharmacy) in the nearby region are also out of stock and unable to order the requested item. 2. Rule-out use of a suitable alternative that is on the CDL and available without a PA. This should be done before requesting approval of a non -CDL alternative. Once both conditions above have been met, providers should: Submit a \"Product Unavailable\" PA requesting an alternative that is from a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) -approved manufacturer. Approv ed products can be located on the Medi -Cal Rx Approved NDC List . Include with the PA verification that the CDL alternative is unavailable in the marketplace in the local region where the member resides. Provide supporting documentation (wholesaler notification, United States FDA notification, association bulletin, e tc. confirming shortages) with the PA DHCS - Medi -Cal Rx Provider Manual 303 09/01/2023 demonstrating that the original product is unavailable and noting the expected duration of the shortage (if known). Request products from a non-CMS-approved manufacturer as a last resort when no other options are available. PA approval may be granted when suitable CDL options are ruled out. An emergency supply of the alternative medication may be dispensed immediately to the member for up to a 14 -day supply. Such a dispensing does not re quire a PA. If the shortage is expected to be long term, or there is risk of initially providing the emergency product and subsequently switching to a CDL alternative after the emergency supply runs out (e.g., destabilization of the condition), then a PA f or extended use of the alternative product should be submitted in a timely manner so it can be adjudicated prior to the emergency supply running out.
