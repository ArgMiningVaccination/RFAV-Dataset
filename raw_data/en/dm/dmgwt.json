If you use the right combination of scents, you can help with certain pain and emotional distress and you can also boost your mood, up your energy levels, and energize your day. The many different combinations you can create with these energy blends can suit your mood, too, not merely blanket cover \"energy boosting\" routines. Some are better for summer, some for spring, some for winter, or autumn. Or you may just feel like getting flowery when it's wintertime to boost your mood in light of, well, a lack of light! Whatever combination of energizing essential oils you choose, you can create a lighter, brighter, richer, or warmer atmosphere in your home for whatever your mood demands. How Do I Decide Which Combinations Will Smell Pleasant Together? The best advice for deciding which energy oil blends to choose any given day - or creating your own blend, if need be - is simply trusting your gut. Think about the scents you have, the scents you love, and the kind of mood you're in. Then, pull out the oils you've got in mind, uncap them and gently pass them under your nose from a short distance of about 6 inches. Smoothly and deeply inhale the scent as they pass. If the scent combination hits the spot, diffuse away! If not, try a couple more combinations to find your sweet spot for the day. How To Blend the Energizing Oils Thankfully, it's pretty easy to blend these essential oil diffuser recipes for energy. - If you're using a diffuser with reeds, remove the reeds before beginning. - Next, prep your diffuser with a quarter cup of your preferred carrier oil. This needs to be an unscented oil or as nearly unscented as you can find. Jojoba and almond oil are good options. - Now, decide which combination of scents you'd like to use. - Then drop the 2-3 drops of each essential oil into the diffuser. - Replace reeds and enjoy! Caution for Pet Owners There are a large number of essential oils that can be harmful to your pets. Be sure to read up on information for your [cats](https://www.hillspet.com/cat-care/routine-care/essential-oils-for-cats) or [dogs](https://coralvilleanimalhospital.com/news/essential-oil-diffusers-and-your-pet) and the essential oils that are safe for use in homes with them. Be aware that your pets may still be very curious about essential oils and want to get into packaging containing them. My cat thinks they're amazing, so I have to keep them carefully guarded to protect her!
