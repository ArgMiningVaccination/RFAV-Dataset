The Atkins diet screams for protein and fat, while naturopaths argue that raw vegetables and fresh fruit are keys to health. But according to ayurvedic counsellor Vinod Sharma such generalisations are dangerous. Sharma (below), who is also a divine energy healer, yoga instructor and vedic astrologer, say that diet should reflect which elemental category a person belongs to under Ayurvedic beliefs. Ayurveda is claimed by many historians to be the planet's oldest health system. Under its philosophy, the three categories represent combinations of basic life elements. Vata is air and ether; pitta is fire, air and water; and kapha is a combination of water and earth. 'We are part of nature, so the elements we see in the universe are present in our systems as well,' says the Bombay-born Sharma, who was one of the first Ayurvedic practitioners in Hong Kong. He has been running AyurYoga International with his wife, Radhika Sharma Vinod, from their Causeway Bay flat for the past three years. Sharma teaches yoga at Fitness First gyms, but says his most important work is guiding people to correct foods for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and strong immune system. According to his beliefs, modern medicines have no place in the human body. 'It is clearly mentioned in Ayurveda that if medicines had been necessary for our systems to work, then without using medicines we should always be sick. The basic medicine we have is the right type of food at the right time.' This holistic philosophy stresses that each category has specific personality traits, body types and health problems attached to it. Sharma says taking a pulse helps him decifer which category a person falls into. I ask him to take my pulse as an example. Checking first that I have an empty stomach, he closes his eyes and enters a meditation for a few minutes. Then he takes my right hand and presses three fingers along the wrist. Having had a good 'listen', he takes my left wrist. Five minutes later, he says: 'You are vata. That is your basic constitution; that we get at the time of conception. From the time of conception we are to live with this constitution until our last breath.' Vata people are particularly susceptible to air, he says. They are prone to dryness, respiratory problems and poor blood circulation. They should avoid too many dry foods such as lentils, nuts and salads (however, a slosh of olive oil and lime juice on the salad will apparently balance the dryness). Sharma says dairy products are especially good for keeping the stiff joints lubricated, as are root vegetables, being very strong with an earth element, which vata people need to remain grounded. 'Air always goes higher,' he says. Pitta people have an excess of fire, with additional earth and water elements. They are prone to acidity, headaches, sinusitis, high blood pressure and skin disorders. 'They have very good drive, motivation, strong will power and, to a certain extent, they are very arrogant,' he says. 'They should never drink cold water. In Ayurveda there is a logical explanation. When the pan is hot and you sprinkle some water, what will happen? Steam. The same will happen within our system but there is no outlet in the body for steam, it remains inside and causes colds. 'Physically speaking they have to be carefully of not eating pungent [red chilli] or acidic foods, otherwise it's very easy for them to get heartburn. They can get acne very easily because of excess heat in the blood.' Kapha is the third category - these people have a heavy body structure because of the water and earth elements. 'Mentally, they are very slow, but once they have remembered something their memory is very good. They are not so ambitious, they have to be pushed. 'They need long hours of sleep, and in America they call them 'couch potatoes'.' Sharma advises that kapha types avoid oily foods, dairy products and lean towards 'light foods' such as lentils and salads. As we move through the seasons, Sharma says, our diets must also change. Winter, he says, is a vata time of year. There is more dryness in the air, so elements of the vata diet - 'salty soup and natural sweet items', for example - should be incorporated into meals. Sharma also recommends regular consumption of honey but - shattering a popular western belief about honey's effectiveness in a nice cup of tea - not in a warm beverage. 'It has a poisonous effect and a bad effect on the enzymes and the intestine,' the holistic practitioner says. Sharma also reads chakras and navel centres, or nadhi dai in Sanskrit. According to Vedic philosophy, 72,000 energy channels meet at the navel. 'Sometimes the navel centre gets dislodged,' he says, adding that if the navel centre is out of whack, all diets - regardless of how healthy - will be rendered ineffective. He also offers advice on exercise. 'There is a general misconception that all exercises are good for everyone,' he warns. 'Vata people should avoid strenuous exercises, especially in the evening: meditative exercises, yoga and stretching are very good. Pitta people can do all types of exercises, but they should not do vigorous breathing exercises that generate more heat in the body. Kapha people should do more vigorous exercises.' Radhika says adopting the holistic approach to eating and health has a hugely positive effect, eventually ridding the body of physical and psychological problems. 'Our philosophy is let the food be your medicine,' she says. 'Perhaps at the start there is some dependence on us as you change your eating habits. But eventually it is about people taking charge of their own "}
