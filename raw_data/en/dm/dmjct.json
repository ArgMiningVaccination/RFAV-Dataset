About Acupuncture Acupuncture is a treatment used to address not only pain, but a wide variety of disease conditions through the stimulation of certain body points using hair-thin, sterile, disposable needles. When acupuncture needles stimulate the body, various changes happen including increased blood flow, regulation of the nervous system, decreased pain sensitivity, and improved emotional well-being (via chemicals in the brain). Acupuncture research has been growing in recent years proving effectiveness for over 45 conditions, as well as safety and cost-effectiveness when performed by a qualified provided. In our current opioid epidemic, many patients and providers are choosing non-medication treatment options, like acupuncture, to address pain. What to Expect When you meet with an acupuncturist at UH, you will first discuss your health history and address the symptoms or conditions you are hoping to address with your acupuncture treatment. Your acupuncturist will give you a physical assessment before beginning your session. While you lay or sit comfortably, your practitioner will gently place the fine, flexible needles at identified acupoints. The needles should cause little or no discomfort. You will then relax while the needles stimulate the various areas of your body. The needles will remain in place for up to 30 minutes before your acupuncturist removes them. You may feel relief from your symptoms within a few hours or days. Some symptoms may take a few treatments before they improve.

[Request an Appointment](/services/integrative-health-network/request-an-appointment) Frequently Asked Questions - How does acupuncture work? - Acupuncture uses hair-thin, sterile, disposable needles to stimulate certain points in the body. Stimulation of these points triggers several body responses, such as increased circulation, nervous system regulation, reduced pain perception, as well as emotional well-being. - What does acupuncture treat? - Acupuncture can treat a wide variety of conditions, from pain to stress and anxiety. Some of the most common conditions we see are: back pain, knee pain, sports injuries, stress, anxiety, depression, headaches and migraines, digestive issues, women's health, infertility, pregnancy support, chronic pain and fatigue. - Does acupuncture hurt? - Acupuncture should not be painful, but it is not without some sensation. Some patients feel a small pinch when the needle is first inserted, but that will fade. Many patients describe a \"warm\", \"tingling\", or \"heavy\" sensation where the needles are placed, and others feel no sensation. A \"twitch\" sensation may be felt when working on muscular conditions. Most patients find treatment very comfortable and relaxing. - What can I expect during a treatment? - You should come to your treatment having eaten a small meal and well hydrated, and wearing loose clothes. Your provider will do an intake, asking questions about your specific concerns, as well as more general questions about your health and lifestyle. Some practitioners will check your tongue and pulse, or palpate or press certain points or muscles to gain more information. After the intake, your provider will get you settled on the treatment table, and begin the treatment. You will relax with the needles for approximately 20 minutes, after which your provider will remove the needles and provide you with post-treatment information. - How should I feel after my treatment? Is there anything I should do when I get home? - After a treatment, many patients report a reduction in pain, as well as lowered stress and anxiety. If you had specific muscle work done, you may feel some residual soreness, like you have had a good workout. Our general post-treatment suggestions are to drink enough fluids, especially warm or room-temperature, and take time to rest in order to help your body heal. Applying heat to areas of pain, as well as gentle movement and stretching, is also recommended. - How often do I need to receive acupuncture? - An initial course of treatment varies, but is generally somewhere between 4-8 treatments, once per week, depending on your specific needs. You and your provider will discuss your progress regularly, and will determine when to start spacing treatments out further for maintenance. Research on Acupuncture The use of acupuncture is supported by a wide body of research that looks at its effectiveness in treating many conditions and symptoms.
