Pharma-funded mainstream media has convinced millions of Americans that Dr. Anthony Fauci is a hero. Hands down, he is anything but. As director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. Anthony Fauci dispenses $6.1 billion in annual taxpayer-provided funding for rigged scientific research, allowing him to dictate the subject, content, and outcome of scientific health research across the globe\u2014truly a dark agenda. Fauci uses the financial clout at his disposal in a back handed manner to wield extraordinary influence over hospitals, universities, journals, and thousands of influential doctors and scientists\u2014whose careers and institutions he has the power to ruin, advance, or reward in an authoritarian manner. During more than a year of painstaking and meticulous research on his laptop and through interviews, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unearthed a shocking story that obliterates media spin on Dr. Fauci . . . and that will alarm every American\u2014Democrat or Republican\u2014who cares about democracy, our Constitution, and the future of our children's health. The Real Anthony Fauci reveals how \"America's Doctor\" launched his career during the early AIDS crisis by partnering with pharmaceutical companies to sabotage safe and effective off-patent therapeutic treatments for AIDS. Fauci orchestrated fraudulent do-nothing studies, and then pressured US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulators into approving a deadly chemotherapy treatment he had good reason to know was worthless against AIDS. Fauci did the unthinkable and repeatedly violated federal laws to allow his Pharma partners to use impoverished and dark-skinned children as lab rats in beyond order, deadly experiments with toxic AIDS and cancer chemotherapies. In early 2000, Fauci shook hands with Bill Gates in the library of Gates' $147 million Seattle mansion, cementing a partnership that would aim to control an increasingly profitable $60 billion global vaccine enterprise with unlimited growth potential. Through funding leverage and carefully cultivated personal relationships with heads of state and leading media and social media institutions, the Pharma-Fauci-Gates alliance exercises dominion over global health policy and our beautiful country. This is not just another political book. The Real Anthony Fauci details how Fauci, Gates, and their cohorts use their control of media outlets\u2014both conservative and liberal leaning, scientific journals, key government and quasi-governmental agencies, global intelligence agencies, and influential scientists and physicians to flood the public with fearful propaganda about COVID-19 virulence and pathogenesis, and to muzzle debate and ruthlessly censor dissent.

Praise For... \"Dr. Joseph Goebbels wrote that 'A lie told once remains a lie, but a lie told a thousand times becomes the truth.' Tragically for humanity, there are many, many untruths emanating from Fauci and his minions. RFK Jr exposes the decades of lies.\" \u2014Luc Montagnier, Nobel laureate \"Bobby Kennedy is one of the bravest and most uncompromisingly honest people I've ever met. Someday he'll get credit for it. In the meantime, read this book.\" & \"Despite all the lying, or maybe in reaction to it, Bobby is becoming a legitimate folk hero. I hear it all the time.\" \u2014Tucker Carlson \"As a trial lawyer, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken on the world's most powerful corporations and held them accountable for harming people and the environment. Those companies denied any wrongdoing\u2014but time and again, judges and juries were persuaded that Kennedy's position was the right one. Kennedy's information should always be considered, and agree or disagree, we all learn from listening.\" \u2014Tony Robbins, New York Times bestselling author \"Bobby Kennedy and I famously disagree about many aspects of the current debates surrounding Covid and vaccines. We also disagree about Dr Fauci. But I always learn when I read or hear Bobby's take. So read this book and challenge its conclusions.\" \u2014Alan Dershowitz, Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law, Emeritus, at Harvard Law School; author of The Case for Vaccine Mandates \"If you have any interest in doing a deep dive into the more than 100-year history of what led up to the COVID-19 pandemic, then The Real Anthony Fauci is an absolute must-read. In addition to exposing Fauci, the book reveals the complex web of connections between Gates and Big Pharma and many of the most important players that were responsible for seeking to implement global tyranny and profit enormously from the propaganda behind the COVID injections, masks, and lockdowns.\" \u2014Dr. Joseph Mercola, founder of Mercola.com \"Bobby Kennedy's book on The Real Anthony Fauci speaks truth in times when health care becomes health harm, untruth rules through anti-science and fake news.\" \u2014Dr. Vandana Shiva, director of Navdanya and vs. the 1% \"I deeply respect [Bobby], and I think if there's anyone that deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, he is the one.\" & \"I thought I understood what was going on from an insider POV. But this is mind-blowing. Anthony Fauci is playing precisely the strategy that he developed and tested during the HIV days. Bobby is on fire in this manuscript. The depth of information and facts, all carefully cited, is mind-blowing. It is a must-read. I think it will really help clarify what has been going down here. Thanks to the consistently dysfunctional COVID-19 response by Fauci and USG/HHS (US Government Health and Human Services Department), we have all become familiar with the terms \"regulatory capture\" and \"Noble Lie.\" The personal opinion and bias of Dr. Fauci has been repeatedly substituted for evidence-based medicine, and we are all living with the consequences. But beyond this mundane incompetence, what this book clearly documents are the deeper forces and systemic, pervasive governmental corruption, which have led us to this point. Not since the reign of former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, have we seen such empire building by a corrupt, longstanding federal employee who is long past retirement age. Dr. Fauci's apparent need to bolster a fragile ego has led to the almost complete systemic corruption of not only US HHS, but the entire world public health system. The consequences will be lasting damage to the reputation of the United States of America, US FDA, and US CDC as honest, independent guardians of public health, which has been carefully nurtured over many decades. The world is now able to clearly see that the US HHS has been captured and compromised by commercial interests. One unintended consequence of allowing and enabling this tragedy will be further erosion in domestic trust in the Public Health System, and in particular, in the entire vaccine enterprise. Global impacts are likely to include accelerating loss of trust in US and western pharmaceutical companies and regulators, and more rapid rise of Asian, Indian, and Middle Eastern pharmaceutical competitors.\" \u2014Robert W. Malone, MD, virologist, immunologist, molecular biologist \"Standing as a pivotal work for the history of science and medicine, this book unveils the astonishing, twisted truth about a man (Fauci) and a corrupt institution (NIH) that have betrayed humanity at every turn in order to achieve profits and power. If the American people knew the truth that's documented here, they would be marching by the millions, demanding criminal prosecutions of all those who are complicit in these outrageous betrayals of humanity. RFK Jr's book closes the loop on one of the most disastrous and truly evil schemes in the history of medicine and science. If humanity does not now demand investigations and prosecutions across this vast landscape of science fraud and pathological 'authority,' we are truly beyond hope.\" \u2014Mike \"Health Ranger,\" founder of NaturalNews.com \"If you've ever wondered why so many good scientists and doctors have been silenced for discoveries that don't fit the mainstream Big Pharma narrative, look no further than Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s tour de force expos\u00e9 of Anthony Fauci. This book reads like a John Grisham legal thriller. Except that it is not fiction. Read it with your eyes wide open. It's time the world woke up to the truth.\" \u2014Christiane Northrup, MD, former assistant clinical professor of Ob/Gyn, University of Vermont College of Medicine; New York Times bestselling author of Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom \"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did a great job. I don't agree with everything, but his case is well laid out and copiously documented. The most disturbing things are the unbelievable financial entanglements, the shoddy treatment of patients in clinical trials, and the culture of intimidation. Overall a very good book and a call to overhaul the CDC/NIH.\" \u2014Dr. Thomas B. Hakes \"To give great responsibility and power to those with no accountability is a recipe for disaster.\" \u2014K Paul Stoller, MD, FACHM, absolutely.\" \u2014Mahin Khatami, PhD \"Kennedy's book proves beyond a shadow of doubt what many Americans have come to learn about Fauci: that he has stifled open debate to the point of utter stagnation of biomedical science. Fauci issues knowledge by decree. This most uninquisitive Fauci is far more concerned with being right and with making sure that the solutions adopted to problems come from his circle rather than in discovering fundamental truths, regardless of the completely externalized cost of his 'solutions.' The evidence shows plainly that Fauci has been wrong on matters of life and death far more than he has been right. Fauci's resulting body count is such that he should have a statue erected with him posing and hanging his head in eternal shame. Thanks to this book, historians will mark Fauci down as the most dangerous threat to global public health in the 20th and 21st Centuries.\" \u2014James Lyons-Weiler, biomedical research scientist \"RFK Jr.'s story of Fauci's failure as the government's AIDS coordinator is a highly disturbing prologue to his COVID mandate as head of NIAID. So, who is Dr. Fauci in the end? Has American medicine truly become a 'racket,' as corrupt as a mafia organization? Does everything in our country turn on the size of the money involved? How can we begin to solve this? The Real Anthony Fauci is a fascinating starting point. RFK Jr. has written a strong, strong book.\" \u2014Oliver Stone, award-winning director, producer, and screenwriter \"As I read Bobby Kennedy Jr.'s book I thought a discreet and thorough criminal investigation into Fauci should occur. Having observed Fauci's flip-flops on his statements on the COVID pandemic, coupled with the book's descriptions by former coworkers as 'neither a competent manager . . . nor skilled or devoted scientist . . . with a domineering nature toward subordinates and rivals that discouraged dissent, a foundation for an investigation exists. The conduct cited, involving the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices approval of a vaccine and how Fauci and his Pharma partners use their PIs to control the key FDA and CDC panels that license and 'recommend' new vaccines, is a red flag that warrants this investigation. The book cites an approval of a vaccine, whereby there was no testing of a vaccine against a placebo in pre-approval trials that is a standard scientific process to 'predict' and/or determine risks if the vaccines would avert more injuries than they would cause\u2014and the vaccine was approved. This appears to be similar to what happened with the Covid vaccines. The Covid clinical trials were not in accordance with prescribed regulations. It brought back memories of criminal bid-rigging schemes conducted by Organized Crime in New York City. If an investigation identified intentional rampant fraud, vaccine deaths could be considered murders and the federal forfeitures would be billions of dollars.\" \u2014Mike Campi, former FBI agent and retired coordinator of the Organized Crime branch of the New York Division \"Who\u2014or what\u2014is the real Anthony Fauci? That may be the most important question facing us today, as We the People struggle to survive the lethal care of 'America's Doctor.' This essential book reveals\u2014at last!\u2014that Dr. Fauci is, on the one hand, a severely twisted person, in his fiendish cunning, vindictiveness, and ruthlessness, a covert blend of Stalin and Iago; and yet, far more importantly, the story of Dr. Fauci's rise and reign is really all about the absolute corruption of our major institutions\u2014government, medicine, academia, and (above all) the press\u2014by Big Pharma (and the Gates Foundation). Those of us who really do believe in science and democracy, now have this book to help us break his fatal spell on everybody else, and start to rid the world of that corruption.\" \u2014Mark Crispin Miller, professor of media studies at New York University; editor, News from Underground \"RFK Jr is a tireless champion of Americans' rights to be informed about their medical choices and has been way out front in warning us of the dangers of an out-of-control pharmaceutical industry. In his new book, The Real Anthony Fauci, he turns the same relentless insider scrutiny on an out-of-control bureaucracy.\" \u2014Naomi Wolf, bestselling author of The Beauty Myth, Give Me Liberty, and Outrages \"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has written the Rosetta Stone that will help the public finally understand the machinations of Dr. Anthony Fauci, and how he has acted as the puppet master of science for the last half-century\u2014pulling the strings of public health and Big Pharma influence and causing both sides of the political aisle to dance to his tune. A must-read to understand the fake news about medicine and therapies, bought and paid for by corporations with billions of dollars at stake.\" \u2014Kent Heckenlively, attorney, science teacher, and New York Times bestselling author \"Throughout history, fear has been used to manipulate and control populations. In a democracy, we have the privilege and responsibility to question the things we are encouraged to fear. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. provides something denied to most Americans in recent years: the opportunity to hear more than one perspective. You can accept or reject the new information in this book\u2014but at least listen.\" \u2014Gavin de Becker, bestselling author of The Gift of Fear \"If you want to understand the role Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, Big Pharma, the CDC, WHO, intelligence agencies and others played in planning, launching, and profiting from the COVID pandemic, drop what you're doing and read this powerful and meticulously researched book! Your future, your family's future, and the future of our democracy are at stake.\" \u2014Ralph Pezzullo, bestselling author of Jawbreaker, Zero Footprint and other books \"At the beginning of the COVID pandemic, a leader rose to the stage, and his soft voice and welcoming smile drew us in, and we trusted him emphatically. After reading Bobby Kennedy's earth-shattering book, The Real Anthony Fauci, it is clear that our trusted COVID leader shouldn't be on a pedestal and should instead be on trial. This book is a must-read for anyone wondering why the United States of America refused to mandate wellness and instead pushed a problematic vaccine.\" \u2014Rachael Ross, MD, PhD \"Let's look at the axis between big government and heath care. The pandemic has flushed out the institutional corruption of the medical establishment. Virtually, everything our government told us about the corona-virus has turned out to be wrong. Space does not permit me to give an exhaustive list. I suggest reading Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s The Real Anthony Fauci. It will shock you. The collaboration between big government and big pharma is a story of self-enrichment on an extraordinary scale, all of which enabled hundreds of thousands to die needlessly. The CDC, WHO, FDA, and NIH are all institutions that proselytize their superior academic knowledge to which, like the Sanhedrin, we are all supposed to bend the knee. In truth, they are corrupt, self-preservation guilds.\" \u2014Rob Smith \"There were times that I had to put the book down and leave it for a day or so either out of disgust, anger, or that certain chapters dealing with treatment of AIDS patients and experimentation upon children in Africa and USA brought on extreme sadness and tears to my eyes:\" \u2014Going Postal \"A visceral history of corrupt bureaucrats that hide under the guise of 'science.' Heavily referenced, provides a plethora of context that dates back decades and continues forward through our current events. Names names and leaves nothing unchallenged. This book is a must-have to dive into the truth that neither legacy media nor social media is comfortable and honest enough to explore and give fair exposure.\" \u2014John W, Online customer \"I received my copy yesterday...I've been using my yellow highlighter non stop ever since and am disgusted by the deep corruption of our gov't and big Pharma that has gone unchecked way too long. I hope this book is read by every health care provider, educator, elected official and citizen of the world. This publication meticulously researched and very well written. Heartfelt applause sent to Mr. Kennedy and his team for their hard work and bravery in exposing these criminals for who they really are. May justice be served on the heads of those who are intentionally causing harm...BUY IT, READ IT, Give copies to everyone you know...this is extremely IMPORTANT information.\" \u2014Kelli J. Bickman, Online customer \"I bought this book and read it cover-to-cover in one day. I couldn't put it down. For four decades, there has been a group of about 30 people who have been trying to get out the truth about Fauci and AIDS, and Kennedy has put it all together and given them a voice. As a gay man, I've looked on with frustration, anger, and sadness that 'my community' denies the AZT genocide and loves its pharmacidal oppressors - and RFK, Jr. lays it all out.\" \u2014Thomas J. Busse, Online customer \"Please take action to become a fully-informed member of society by availing yourself of the facts contained in this book. Following in the footsteps of his father and uncle, RFK Jr is to be highly esteemed for his dedication to the truth, his intelligence and bravery in providing us with this information. Atrocities which have been committed are given the light of day.\" \u2014Marguerite9, Online customer \"Best book I've read in years. Hopefully many more will purchase and read it. Wonderful expos\u00e9 of Fauci and his accomplices in gain of function research, and forcing unnecessary vaccines purely for profit, offering no long-term health benefits to any population. Kudos to JFK jr and all those who helped with this book. Well deserved number 1 book on Amazon.\" \u2014Alistair Meney, Online customer \"RFK Jr. and Children's Health Defense meticulously research and source their information carefully. As a lawyer who is working hard to push back against corporate capture and corruption, Mr. Kennedy cannot afford to take a misstep or dispense misinformation. The corruption within the Public Health industry is mind boggling. Look for the truth from those who have everything to lose, and are risking everything in order to shine a light on the darkness attempting to envelop our country.\" \u2014Amanda l, Amazon customer \"This evening I read the introduction, the first chapter, and skimmed around some of the later chapters of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new book. Very well researched and referenced material that's hard to find elsewhere, compiled in a very readable format. It's profoundly informing about how the US government has put pharmaceutical interests above public health, and deeply disturbing to read, of course, but not terribly surprising. As the son of Robert F. Kennedy, and nephew of John F. Kennedy, it was quite a brave and courageous act to write this book\u2014which the mainstream media either demonizes, ridicules, or ignores\u2014because I'm sure a lot of powerful do not want to see this material in print. I highly recommend that everyone read this important book.\" \u2014David J. Brown, Online customer \"I love the clear data that RFK Jr. presents, I love his openness to corrections and honest debates. I know he has asked Dr. Sanjay Gupta to debate and Sanjay has not responded. I would also love love love if Fauci were to debate RFK Jr. on these topics in this book. I believe RFK Jr. has some very compelling evidence that would make the debate so powerful. The writing of this book is clear, highly referenced, and fun to read. Let's live in the truth instead of propaganda, instead of promoting fear. Let's promote harmony, love, kindness, and freedom of speech. Let's promote healthy investigations, and honest well-referenced debates. Bravo Bobby, I feel so thankful to you and to your team and all the research that went into this. I also love that there is a QR code, so that if a reader actually has a valid update to what RFK JR. wrote, they can add the comments and citations. This book is how science and policy should be implemented. With collaboration, honest debate, and wisdom. Thank you! I love this book and HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!\" \u2014Karen, Online customer \"Robert F. Kennedy, Jr's new book is packed with information and references. Each chapter also comes with a scannable code to learn the latest information on that subject. In the Acknowledgments section, the book includes a long list of some of the thousands of doctors and scientists that are, thankfully, speaking against Fauci and the vaccine cartel's so-called 'consensus.' After that, Mr. Kennedy exposes, with detailed explanations and meticulous references, Anthony Fauci's lies and corruption, which have taken place for decades. If you are against this book, buy it, read it, and check the references to see if Mr. Kennedy's information is true or not.\" \u2014B. Ortiz, Online customer \"A critical account of some of the loudest and most influential voices that have deeply impacted American's lives and livelihoods especially over the last 2 years. I think it behooves all of us to have the courage to read multiple sides\u2014not just the view of mainstream media. Highly recommend!\" \u2014Stacey, Online customer \"I think this is an exceptional piece of research and logical reporting. I have no medical expertise background, so I had to spend a lot of time examining the documentation of each of the controversial arguments. I found the arguments compelling, and the documentation substantial. So much so, that I wrote three senators and my house representative urging each of them to convene a group of medical experts (not on the receiving end of government largess) to review this work in public forum so that the American people can either affirm their faith in our government health institutions or accept Kennedy's argument that we are being led in the wrong health direction (and at this point, I am less concerned about the reasons why). Unfortunately, my requests to our political leadership fell on deaf ears. I am eager to review other medical experts' opinions (besides those I have seen on the news who are in the anti-Fauci camp), but have not seen a forum to date. So I have had to formulate my own opinion of the deeply disturbing and well documented indictments raised in this work, and to date accept the rationale, pending some other expert reviews.\" \u2014Don W. Alexander, Online customer "}
