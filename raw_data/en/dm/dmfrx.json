From Reiki to Shamanic Healing, each modality offers a variety of unique benefits. In this article, we will explore 10 different types of energy healing practices and help you decide which one is right for you! What is Energy Healing? Energy healing is the process of restoring balance and wellness to your energy field. It is based on the interconnectedness of all life, and the belief that energy flows through and surrounds us all. When our energy is disrupted or blocked, it can lead to physical, emotional, or spiritual disharmony. Energy healing can be used to address a variety of issues, including: - Physical pain - Emotional stress or anxiety - Relationship problems - Spiritual blockages or stagnation Different Types of Energy Healing There are many types of energy healing modalities, each with its own unique approach and benefits. Depending on your needs and intentions, some may be more aligned to your individual energy system than others. Reiki Reiki is a healing technique that uses universal energy to restore balance and harmony. The practitioner directs this energy to where it is needed most by placing their hands near or on the body. Recipients may feel the release of stuck emotions, relaxation, and peace during a session. Acupuncture Acupuncture is a practice that uses energy pathways, called meridians, to restore balance and harmony. The belief is that by inserting needles into specific points along these meridians, practitioners can unblock any stagnation and restore the flow of health and wellness. Massage Massage is one of the oldest and most common forms of energy healing. The therapist uses their hands to move energy around your body. This can help promote relaxation, improve blood and lymphatic circulation. Reflexology Reflexology is a type of massage that uses pressure points on the feet, hands, and ears to promote healing. Reflexologists believe that these pressure points correspond to different parts of the body. By massaging or applying pressure to these points, we can encourage energy to flow freely and restore balance. Craniosacral Craniosacral therapy is a light touch treatment that uses gentle hands-on techniques to examine the movement of fluids in and around the central nervous system. This therapy can help relieve stress, tension headaches, and neck pain. Craniosacral is also known to help restore balance and wellness after traumatic injuries. Yoga Yoga is an ancient healing modality that uses movement, meditation, and the chakra system to support healing and well-being. Some popular styles of yoga that focus on energy healing include [Kundalini](https://www.locallywellsd.com/kundalini-yoga-san-diego/), Iyengar, and Vinyasa. Qi Gong Qi Gong is a system of energy healing that uses movement, breathwork, and visualization to open and balance the energy pathways in the body. Qi Gong is thought to improve health and help relieve stress, anxiety, and pain. Ecstatic Dance A relatively new form of energy healing, ecstatic dance uses movement and music to open the body, mind, and spirit. During an ecstatic dance session, participants move freely to express their emotions and connect with their inner power. This type of dance is thought to release blocked energy, clear the mind, and boost self-confidence. Sound Healing [Sound healing](https://www.locallywellsd.com/ultimate-guide-sound-healing-san-diego/) uses sound and vibration to restore balance and harmony in the body.
