By Catherine Price Discovered barely a century ago, vitamins were a revolutionary breakthrough in nutritional science, providing cures and preventions for some of the world's most terrifying diseases. But it wasn't long before vitamins spread from the labs of scientists to the offices of food marketers, and began to take on a life of their own. By the end of World War II, vitamins were available in forms never before seen in nature - vitamin-fortified peanut butter, vitamin gum, even vitamin doughnuts - and, far from expressing skepticism over these products, the public clamoured for more. The era of \"vitamania,\" as one 1940s journalist called it, had begun. Today, we're still vitamaniacs, such believers in vitamins' inherent goodness that we don't realise just how much scientists still don't understand about how vitamins work in our bodies, or how much of each we require. We're not aware that vitamins (and our enthusiasm for them) are what opened the door for the rotating cast of supposed wonder nutrients that intrigue and confuse us today, whether they be probiotics or antioxidants or omega 3s. We don't notice the ways that food marketers and dietary supplement makers use synthetic vitamins to add a veneer of health to otherwise unhealthy products; nor do we acknowledge the extent to which we use vitamins and these other vitamin-inspired nutrients to give ourselves a free pass to overeat foods of all kinds. And we certainly don't recognise the irony of our vitamin obsession: that by encouraging the idea that isolated dietary chemicals hold the keys to good health, our vitamania is making us less healthy. This is not an attack on man-made synthetic vitamins themselves, which continue to prevent deadly deficiencies all over the world. Rather, it's an attempt to use the story of our vitamania to explore our bizarre relationship with nutrition, and propose an alternative to our obsessive quest for perfection - one that's focused on acting on what we do know instead of being tormented by what we don't. The General Nutrition Corporation store near my childhood home - that's the official name of the global supplement chain GNC - is one part science fiction and one part 19th-century apothecary. Its shelves are lined with products whose names are so high-tech that they're incomprehensible, like vitaliKoR Daily Maintenance and Cellucor M5 Extreme. But despite the modern packaging and the innumerable mentions of \"science,\" there's something oddly anachronistic about it; when I visited it one January afternoon, I felt like I was stepping back in time. My purpose was dermatological: after three problem-free decades, I had developed sensitive skin. I'd tried seeking answers from modern Western medicine - I had done allergy tests for hundreds of chemicals and seen multiple dermatologists - but, other than giving me steroid creams, no doctor had been able to help. And so I'd come to GNC to find a solution in a supplement. By supplement, I didn't necessarily mean a vitamin, though the two terms are often incorrectly used interchangeably. True, technically speaking, all vitamin pills are considered dietary supplements. But dietary supplements are not all vitamins - the term also includes nearly every other legal, nonpharmaceutical product you could ingest for health, including herbs and botanicals, amino acids, enzymes, metabolites, and the ominous \"organ tissues and glandulars\" (which are actually ground-up organ tissues and glands). Consider the Vitamin Shoppe, one of GNC's competing chains. There are only 13 human vitamins - and yet the so-called \"Vitamin\" Shoppe sells more than 18,000 products. Despite their shared categorisation, there are significant differences between traditional vitamin pills and the more exotic concoctions on GNC's shelves - whether they be Chinese herbs, botanicals, or proprietary products with crazy-sounding names. Unlike other dietary supplements, with vitamins, their ingredients are listed on the label and, at least in most cases, if a product says it contains vitamin C, it probably really does contain vitamin C. All this is not necessarily true for non-vitamin and non-mineral supplements. I was staring at a homeopathic remedy display when a young saleswoman approached. \"Can I help you find something?\" she asked. I told her about my skin issues. \"Are you taking fish oil?\" she asked. Yes, I was. \"How much?\" I told her that I'd been taking a few capsules every other day or so. \"Maybe you should try omega 7s, then,\" she said. \"They're very important for the skin.\" I looked at her blankly. In all my research on fatty acids, I had never heard of omega 7. \"It's a different type of fatty acid - you can get it from sea buckthorn,\" she said. \"Sea buckthorn?\" \"It's a plant that grows in really harsh conditions,\" she said. She led me to a display of supplements and picked up two options, Supercritical Omega7 and Sea Buckthorn Force. Since their ingredients appeared basically the same, my choice came down to product name: Did I want the judgmental sea buckthorns, or the ones that sounded like an elite military unit? I went for the Supercritical. \"While the benefit of Sea Buckthorn on the body's largest organ, the skin, has been widely documented in ancient texts,\" said the box of the Supercritical formulation, \"it also has an extensive history of traditional use in Tibet & Mongolia for the body's sensitive internal organs - in particular the mucous membranes that line the stomach/GI tract, upper respiratory tract, and vagina. The ability of this botanical to help moisturize and soothe these sensitive internal areas has made it a staple of traditional herbal systems. Similar properties have been reported in various modern studies.\" Forget my sensitive internal areas - the description itself made me feel emotionally soothed. The dermatologists and allergists I'd seen had been annoyingly noncommittal, unable to even agree upon a diagnosis, let alone a treatment. In contrast, the box's label was decisive and reassuring, conjuring up images of ancient sages possessed of a wisdom that modern medicine has lost. And whereas modern medicine is full of caveats - \"This is for some people but not others\"; \"It may be eczema but we can't be sure\" - sea buckthorn was confident: it would solve my skin issues, no doubt about it. Let us not forget, after all, that its powers had been widely documented in ancient texts. It had an extensive history of traditional use in Tibet and Mongolia. It had been investigated in various modern studies. Like those of many supplements, the whole label evoked an aura of ancient Eastern wisdom just waiting to be rediscovered, a pharmacopoeia of natural treatments ready to step in where Western medicine has failed. Despite my inherent scepticism, I couldn't help wondering, What if this stuff actually worked? As I looked at some of the store's other products - the milk thistle for liver health, the ginkgo for mental clarity, the Women's Procreation Vcaps (\"nature's gift to hopeful mums\") - it occurred to me that hope is the driving force behind nearly all the supplements that line supermarket and pharmacy shelves. Viewed this way, the Vitamin Shoppe's 18,000 products begin to make a lot more sense: in a world where the so-called medical experts are often unable to help, we turn to supplements for comfort. The more desperate we are and the more modern medicine throws up its hands, the better \"ancient wisdom\" - and supplements that claim to encapsulate it - can begin to sound. Unfortunately, when I read the sea buckthorn's box again, I realised some thing less inspiring: I had no idea what it was actually talking about. What was a \"herbal system\"? What did it mean to be supercritical? (Was I going to be super-disappointed?) Since when has Mongolia been a top source of medical advice? And which \"various modern studies\" had investigated sea buckthorn's effects on vaginas? I phrased my questions slightly differently for the saleswoman, asking her whether she knew of any controlled clinical studies involving sea buckthorn, whether there was a way to tell its quality, and whether it had been approved by the FDA. She didn't know about any studies, though she assured me she was personally confident that the quality of that particular company's products was high. As for the FDA? \"They're more about pharmaceuticals,\" she told me. \"When it comes to this type of stuff, they don't get involved.\" The idea that the FDA wouldn't \"get involved\" in an industry that brought in about $32 billion in US sales in 2012 seemed strange. But the saleswoman was insistent - and in many ways correct. By the time I left the shop, sea buckthorn in hand, I had questions much larger than the mystery of my omega 7s. I wanted to know how we, as consumers, have become OK with the idea that vitamin C should exist in the same regulatory category as RIPPED FREAK Hybrid Fat Burner, or capsules filled with ground-up glands. And I wanted to know how we've reached a point, in this age of what can seem like ever-expanding government regulation, where dietary supplement makers in the United States are not required to do any testing for safety or efficacy at all.
