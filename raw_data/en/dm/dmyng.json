WS 1: Breeding cereals - a process of creative transformation (DE/EN) Dr. Isabell Hildermann and Nina T\u00f6pfer Since thousands of years cereals are amongst the main staple foods of humankind. This workshop deals with the long history of cereals and the fundamental role of humans during the evolutionary process of these important plants. Wheat, spelt and rye are well-known cereals. But who knows more about the relationship of wild einkorn, wild emmer or wild grasses and our major foodstuffs? Humans carried out intensive breeding work on plants and thereby transformed wild plants to plants suitable for human nutrition. For centuries, breeding was done by breeders in the fields under the open sky. Only the most promising plants were selected for the breeding programs. Crosses were carried out respecting the natural barriers between plants. Nowadays, breeding takes place in the lab in test tubes and more and more by means of genetic modification, which does not respect the natural crossing barriers between plants any longer. What are the impacts of these different methods and techniques on plants, when we assume that the breeding process does not only influence the outer shape of a plant but moreover the inner quality and vitality? Examples of bio-dynamic breeding will show us, that modern breeding can still be done successfully without the use of genetic modification. WS 2: Nutrition as a foundation for curative education (DE/EN) Anita Pedersen and Heinz Fendrich Number of participants: max. 15 Looking at the threefold plant and its relation to the threefold human being, we would like to research different constitutions and imbalances, described in Rudolf Steiners curative education course, also temperaments could be looked at. We will have some samples to taste. WS 3: Voglia di trasformazioni - come sarebbe con processes in biodynamic agriculture - transformation processes in the human being (DE/EN) Susanna K\u00fcffer-Heer and Dr. Reinhard Kindt In his Agriculture Course of 1924, Rudolf Steiner described the foundations of an agriculture that can provide a future for man and earth. One of its cornerstones are the biodynamic preparations. Through them, transformation processes are set off and shaped in very special ways. The preprations also have an effect on the quality of the food produced, and hence on people. Especially in the 8th lecture of \"Spiritual Science and Medicine\" (GA 312), Rudolf Steiner describes smelling and tasting and its transformations in the human being. After a short introduction to the topic, we will trace the transformation processes occurring in biodynamic agriculture. Then we will look at the metamorphoses of smelling and tasting in the human being and try to become a sense of the meaning of using \"living\" products for our nutrition. WS 6: From nutrition knowledge to everyday practice Renate Lendle and Judith Schake Often people know a lot about healthy nutrition, but how can this knowledge be transformed into everyday life practice? How do we organise our shopping, the prepration of meals and how do we unite the differing needs concerning food that exist within our family, with people in different ages and with different temperaments? How do we maintain our joy in eating? We want to look at these questions together and work out realistic, practical solutions. WS 7: Les \u00e9pices : un changement aux forces nature les humaine . but and inner work (6-months-excercises) (DE/EN) Sabine Hurwitz Nutrition - a Creative Process: How can the process of transformation of our food be accompanied through inner work? Inner work as the creation of a new dimension for the quality of our food. Using the 6-months-excercises as an example of inner work in Anthroposophy we work on transforming our inner attitude, by creativity infusing our thinking, feelings and actions with balance and enhanced metabolic life forces which influences the quality of our food. WS 10: Our eating biography - how life is mirrored in our eating behaviour (DE/EN) Martina Kallenberg and Claudia Tritschel Eating biography: What happens if we change our eating habits? Does it have a wider impact on our life? How can we support ourselves to specific situations that come up in life, by adapting our diet? This workshop provides a space for us to reflect on our personal eating biography. We try to sense our current nutrition needs and explore how we can support our development through choice of food. How is our life linked to what we eat? WS 11: Comment ainsi que des de sur les fondamentaux de cuisine de collectivit\u00e9 pour permettre une culture \"minimale\" commune et cr\u00e9er les conditions pour partager ensuite des avanc\u00e9es sur le plan de la conception de la d'une alimentation partager ses exp\u00e9riences, questions Help! I do? (DE/EN) Johannes Kingma and Edmond Schoorel A child that doesn't want to eat often makes his/her parents feel helpless, insecure and sometimes angry. There are a variety of reasons why children dont eat well. It can have to do with the education or related to the chid itself. The child, for example, may be about to fall ill. Food intolerance or digestion problems can also play a role. Sometimes psychological issues are relevant: the child refuses to eat to achieve increased attention form its parents, or to achieve something nice for itself or to avoid something unpleasant. In this workshop we want to look at the whole array of possible causes of eating disorders in children. Regarding the methodology, we want to ask each participant to bring a case-study of a child with a clear eating disorder. It's helpful but not essential to bring a picture of the child. The case-study descriptions form the basis of our work, as we try to study and order them together in the first part of the workshop. In the second part, we will discuss therapeutical options based on the experience of participants. This experience may be the same as the example given before, or it may differ. The therapeutical measures applied in the participant's examples do not have to have been successful. Oftenw e learn more out of unsuccessful interventions than of successful ones. WS 13: Guided tour to the statue \"The representative of man\" with focus on the conference theme (DE/EN) Esther Gerster Friday, 2. May 10.45-12.15 am Meeting point: Exhibition Room, 3rd floor, south staircase Guided tour and artistic appreciation of the statue of the Representative of Humanity in wood with Lucifer and Ahriman as it relates to the theme of the conference \"Nutrition - a creative process. Tracing the paths of transformation.\" (with consecutive translation from the German). This statue was conceived and executed by Rudolf Steiner and Edith Maryon with the assistance of many other co-workers. It is an Imagination of certain forces and the beings representing these forces which are part of our daily lives. In actively observing the image we become aware of the polarity of forces active in all the processes of life, including those of nutrition. In dealing with and in bringing these forces into balance, a living, animated equilibrium can come about. We experience these when we observe this work in meditative practice. "}
