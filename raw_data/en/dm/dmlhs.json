In other words, it effects the entire brain. Western medicine calls this condition \"Autism Spectrum Disorder\" (\"ASD\") because kids (and adults ) show different degrees of these characteristics. In \"Asperger's Syndrome\", the child can function fairl y well and can be highly successful as they often become e xperts in their very restricted area(s) of interest. Auti stic savants (previously called \"idiot savants\") are usually not functional but have extra-ordinary gifts that cause us to question our notions of intelligence, talent and cr eativity 1. Most holistic practitioners consider other brain conditions such as Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), childhood seizure disorders, behav ioral disorders, and other \"random\" conditions to be vari ations or \"on the spectrum\" with autism. Most of these br ain dysfunctions do not go away with time, though with brain maturation by age 25, the child can learn to compen sate for some of these weaknesses and to utilize their uniqu e talents. For the purposes of this article, all the se brain conditions will be collectively called ASD. Scary Facts ASD is on the rise. The formal statistic used to be 1 in 150 births, it has now increased to 1 out of 91 bir ths, and 1 out of 50 male births 2. Some say that this increase is due to better repor ting; however, most practitioners agree that, if anything , it is still under-reported. If one includes other brain dysfun ctions, such as ADHD in the statistics, it is probably as m uch as 1 out of 5 of our kids who have dysfunctional brains. ASD is not a \"disease\" because there is no one kno wn cause. Recent research demonstrates a genetic tend ency. However, only 20% of illness is determined by genes ; the rest by environmental factors and the lives of our parents and grandparents, passed on by epigenes 3. In addition, the dramatic rise over a very short period of time cann ot be explained by genes; therefore environmental factors are certainly dominant. There is no question that the amount of chemicals in our mothers, fetuses and children h as increased over the past few decades 4. The Vaccine Connection There is much mis-information and mis-perception about the relationship between ASD and vaccines. However, the facts are simple: some kids clearly de veloped ASD shortly after receiving vaccination; most kids with ASD do not have as clear an association. The impli cations of these facts are also simple: while single vaccin es are \"safe\" for the majority of kids (and adults), for s ome a single or multiple vaccination can be devastating. In some ways, this is similar to most pharmaceutic als-- that they are safe for the majority of the populati on, but can be devastating for a small minority. It comes down to risk- benefit ratio--if the risk is small and the benefit huge then it is worth taking that risk. On a population basis, the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks. Howeve r, on an individual basis, this is not always true. Also, vaccines are different than drugs in that the y are designed to have persistence in the body . It is their persistence and additive effects that in some kids cause the problem. The combination of vaccines into DPT and MMR, for the convenience of the parent and physicia n, increases the toxic load and challenge to the immun e system when compared to giving each vaccine separat ely. In some kids, it seems to be the preservatives (mer cury) and other things added to the vaccine (called adjuv ants 5), that instigate or exacerbate brain dysfunction; in other kids it is the viral material (such as the weakened meas les virus) that causes the immune system to go haywire. Fifty years ago, kids received only a few vaccines -- smallpox, measles and DPT. Then polio vaccine was developed. However, nowadays, kids are receiving o ver 20 vaccinations by the age of 5, a critical time in th e development of their immune system and brain. It i s now formally recommended that kids receive their first vaccination for hepatitis B within the first 24 hou rs of life! 6 There are ways to reasonably negotiate these issue s that will be discussed below. A Myriad of Other Factors In the diagnosis of ASD, there are two main catego ries: congenital (at birth) and acquired. In the congeni tal form, the child's nervous system seems to have been dysfunctional since birth. In the acquired form, t he child develops normally until a certain event occurs, aft er which there is a sudden or gradual deterioration of neuro logical functioning. Reaction to MMR when it does occur is dramatic in that when given at 15 months, the child is already walking and talking, so a loss of speech or coordination is apparent. Neurological reactions at other times are not as ap parent and often difficult to measure. Sometimes these changes can only be perceived by a parent, but difficult to observe by a clinician, he nce the loss of trust and a desperate and understandably \"crazy\" parent. Despite the misperceptions, hype and denial in the popular media, experts in ASD agree that it is a mu lti- factorial condition 7. ASD and other brain dysfunctions are web-like, not being \"caused\" by a single factor or event, but usually manifesting when \"the last straw\" occur s. This manifestation can occur months or years after a dysfunctional process has begun. For example, Vita min D, B12, iron and magnesium deficiencies, present in up to 90% of the world's children and adults, can make th e brain and immune systems vulnerable to the toxic effects of vaccines, pesticides, preservatives and other chall enges. Many kids with ASD note significant improvement with change of diet. Foods not only provide nutrie nts and energy, they also program our genes and biochemistr y. Foods of today are not what they were 50 years ago. Specific foods, especially dairy, wheat, soy and co rn, are genetically modified, over-farmed, over processed, and over-utilized and can be a significant contributor to illness 11/ 10/09-5 autism_ae.doc \"Autism and Brain Dysfunctions \" M. Cheikin MD Page 2 through allergenicity, pesticides and other factors . And so, like the growing list of chronic dysfuncti ons of many of our bodily systems, including diabetes, dep ression, sleep disorder, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, thyroid disease and Alzheimer's disease, ASD in children an d adults are a \"spectrum\" of disorders that affect th e brain and are \"caused\" by a spectrum of factors that incl ude nature and nurture. What to Do These issues are so important that every parent, e very potential parent, every grandparent, every educator , every politician, and every person who wants to develop a nd preserve optimal brain function, should invest time and energy on this topic. Specific steps to consider: 1) Read read read. Learn learn learn. Don't accep t what \"they\" say, good or bad. Read and learn enough to feel confident in your conclusions. There is lots of ba d information out there. There is also lots of good information. 2) Commit. To a lifestyle that saves our children. As we know, the earth is at a critical juncture. So are our children. For the first time in hundreds of years, this generation of children will be sicker and live a po orer life than their parents. 3) Consider a change of food plan (not \"diet\"). Mo ve away from animal, dairy, wheat and soy based foods to a more \"green\" diet with lots of organic brightly colored vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds and beans. 4) Regarding vaccines, the decision is highly perso nal--it is not \"one size fits all\". Factors to consider inclu de: a) how potentially disabling is the disease and it's treat ment; b) timing of the vaccination (the immune system is con sidered immature until age 5-6, exposure to the disease may not occur until after this age, allowing for a reasonab le delay), c) if the vaccine is given individually or in combi nation with others, d) adjuvants and toxins known to be in the vaccine (i.e. multi-dose vials of flu and other vac cines still are preserved with thimerisol, a form of mercury). 5) Consider testing for toxicity (especially heavy metals), and deficiencies, that can affect the health of you r family. If planning pregnancy, try to get tested at least a year before conception, to allow for the correction of a ny imbalances and to clean up the diet. Removal of da iry, wheat and soy before and during pregnancy and breas t feeding can have a significant affect on your child 's entire life 8. 6) There are many tests and interventions that can significantly help a child to recover from ASD. Th ese include special biochemical tests, diets, supplemen ts, acupuncture, yoga, ayurveda, biofeedback, and many others. Work with an experienced practitioner.
