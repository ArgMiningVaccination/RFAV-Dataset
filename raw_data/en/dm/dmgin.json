DEFINITIONS All definitions in the Texas Water Code (TWC) \u00a726.001 and Title 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 305 apply to this permit and are incorporated by reference. Some specific definitions of words or phrases used in this permit are as follows: Arid Ar eas. Areas with an average annual rainfall of less than ten (10) inches. Benchmark. A benchmark pollutant concentration is a guidance level indicator that helps determine the effectiveness of chosen best management practices ( BMPs ). This type of monitorin g differs from \"compliance monitoring\" in that exceedances of the indicator or benchmark level are not permit violations, but rather indicators that can help identify problems at the site with exposed or unidentified pollutant sources; or control measures that are either not working correctly, whose effectiveness need to be re -considered, or who need to be supplemented with additional BMP(s). Best Management Practices (BMPs). Schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and ot her techniques to control, prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants. BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control site runoff, spills or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storag e areas. Co-located Industrial Activities. Industrial activities conducted at a facility that are described by two or more SIC codes listed in this general permit. Co-located Industrial Facilities . Industrial facilities, having different operators, that ar e located on a common property or adjoining property and that conduct industrial activities described by one or more sectors of this general permit. Composite Sample . A sample made up of a minimum of three effluent portions collected in a continuous 24 -hour period or during the period of daily discharge if less than 24 hours, combined in volumes proportional to flow, and collected at the intervals required by 30 TAC \u00a7319.9 (b). Construction Activity . Includes soil disturbance activities, including clearing, grading, and excavating; and does not include routine maintenance that is performed to maintain the original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, or original purpose of the site (e.g., the routine grading of existing dirt roads, asphalt overlays of existin g roads, the routine clearing of existing right -of- ways, and similar maintenance activities). Regulated construction activity is defined in terms o f small and large construction activity. Small Construction Activity is construction activity that results i n land disturbance of equal to or greater than one (1) acre and less than five (5) acres of land. Small construction activity also includes the disturbance of less than one (1) acre of total land area that is part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb equal to or greater than one (1) and less than five (5) acres of land. Large Construction Activity is construction activity that results in land disturbance of equal to or greater than five (5) acres of land. Large construction activity also includes the disturbance of less than five (5) acres of total land area that is part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb equal to or greater than five (5 ) acres of land. Control Measure. Any BMP , including structural and non- structural controls, or other method (including effluent limitations) used to prevent or reduce the discharge of po llutants to water in the state. Multi Sector General Permit TPDES Gene ral Permit No. TXR050000 Part I Page 11 Daily Average Concentration . The arithmetic average of all effluent samples, composite or grab as required by this permit, within a period of one calendar month, consisting of at least four separate representative measurements. When four samples are not available in a c alendar month, the arithmetic average (weighted by flow) of all values taken during the month must be used as the daily average concentration. Daily Maximum Concentration. The maximum concentration measured on a single day, as determined by laboratory anal ysis of a grab sample or a composite sample. Diffuse Point Source . A conveyance from which pollutants are or may be discharged that results from grading land for the purpose of adding parking lots, roads, and buildings so as to collect and convey stormwate r off-site to prevent flooding (i.e. without a single point of origin or not introduced into a receiving stream from a specific outlet). Diffuse point sources include any identifiable conveyance from which pollutants might enter surface water in the state. By changing the surface or establishing grading patterns of the land, runoff is conveyed along the resulting drainage or grading patterns. A diffuse point source is not true sheet flow. Discharge. For the purpose of this permit, the drainage, release, or disposal of stormwater associated with industrial activity and certain allowable non- stormwater sources listed in this general permit to surface water in the state . Drought . For the purpose of this permit, an extended period of no precipitation in which a stormwater discharge does not occur during a monitoring or reporting period. Edwards Aquifer . As defined under 30 TAC \u00a7213.3 (relating to the Edwards Aquifer), that portion of an ar cuate belt of po rous, water -bearing, predominantly carbonate rocks known as the Edwards and Associated Limestones in the Balcones Fault Zone trending from west to east to northeast in Kinney, Uvalde, Medina, Bexar, Comal, Hays, Travis, and Williamson Counties; and compose d of the Salmon Peak Limestone, McKnight Formation, West Nueces Formation, Devil's River Limestone, Person Formation, Kainer Formation, Edwards Formation, and Georgetown Formation. The permeable aquifer units generally overlie the less- permeable Glen Rose Formation to the south, overlie the less- permeable Comanche Peak and Walnut Formations north of the Colorado River, and underlie the less- permeable Del Rio Clay regionally. Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone. Generally, that area where the stratigraphic units constituting the Edwards Aquifer crop out, including the outcrops of other geologic formations in proximity to the Edwards Aquifer, where caves, sinkholes, faults, fractures, or other permeable features would create a potential for recharge of surface waters into the Edwards Aquifer. The recharge zone is identified as that area designated as such on official maps located in the offices of the TCEQ and the appropriate undergrou nd water conservation district. Existing Discharge. For the purpose of this permit, this term applies to the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity and certain allowable non- stormwater sources listed in this general permit that has been authorized previously under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ( NPDES ) or Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (TPDES ) general or individual permit. Facility . For the purpose of this permit, all contiguous land and fixtures (including ponds and lagoons), structures, or appurtenances used at an industrial facility described by one or more of Sectors A through AD of this general permit. Grab Sample . An individual sample collected in less than 15 minutes. General Permit . A permit issued to authorize the discharge of waste into or adjacent to water in the state for on e or more categories of waste discharge within a geographical area of the state or the entire state as provided by TWC \u00a726.040. Multi Sector General Permit TPDES Gene ral Permit No. TXR050000 Part I Page 12 Hyperchlorinated Water . Water resulting from hyperchlorination of waterlines or vessels, with a chlorine concentration greater t han 10 milligrams per liter (mg/ L). Hyperchlorination of Waterlines or Vessels . Treatment of potable water lines or tanks with chlorine for disinfection purposes, typically following repair or partial replacement of the waterline or tank, and subsequently flushing the contents. Impaired Water . For the purposes of this permit, water bodies identified as impaired on the latest approved CWA Section 303(d) List, or waters with an EPA -approved or established total maximum daily load ( TMDL ) that are found on the latest EPA approved Texas Integrated Report of Surface Water Quality for CWA Sections 305(b) and 303(d) as not meeting applicable state water quality standards . Inactive Industrial Facilities . A facility where all industrial activ ities that are described in Part II, Section A.1. of this permit are suspended, and authorization under this general permit is required to be maintained. Also see sector- specific definitions for Inactive facilities in Part V, Sections G, H, J, and L of thi s general permit. Industrial Activity . Any of the ten (10) categories of industrial activities included in the definition of \" stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity\" as defined in 40 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) \u00a7122.26(b)(14)(i)- (ix) and (xi). Infeasible. For the purpose of this permit, infeasible means not technologically possible or not economically practicable and achievable in light of best industry practices. The TCEQ notes that it does not intend for any MSGP permit requiremen t to conflict with state water right laws. Inland Waters. All surface water in the state other than those defined as tidal waters. Minimize. For the purposes of this permit, minimize means to reduce and/or eliminate to the extent achievable using control m easures that are technologically available and economically practicable and achievable in light of best industry practices.

Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code . A four (4) digit code created by the U.S. Office of Management & Budget for statistical classif ication purposes that describes an industrial activity that takes place at a facility or site. It is possible for a facility or site to have multiple SIC codes depending on the varying activities that take place. Primary SIC Code - (also known as \"Site SIC Code\" or \"Facility SIC Code\"). For the purpose of this permit, an SIC code that describes the principal product or group of products produced or distributed at a facility, or that describes services rendered. The primary SIC code may be determined based o n the value of receipts or revenues or, if such information is not available for a particular facility, the number of employees or production rate for each process may be compared. The operation that generates the most revenue or employs the most personnel is the operation in which the facility is primarily engaged. In situations where the vast majority of on -site activity falls within one SIC code, that activity may be the primary SIC code. Secondary SIC Code . For the purpose of this permit an SIC code tha t describes an industrial activity that is performed at a regulated facility or site that is in addition to the primary SIC code. Determining the secondary industrial activity that occurs at a facility or site is accomplished by using the same criteria as determining the primary industrial activity at the facility (e.g., production value, receipts, employment). Storm Resistant Shelter .

Limited to facilities that are designated by the executive director as needing a permit to control pollution related to stormwater discharges and that do not meet the description of an industrial activity covered by Sectors A- AC. 2. Miscellaneous Industria l Activities Sector AD is used to provide permit coverage for facilities that are designated by the executive director as needing a permit to control pollution related to stormwater discharges and do not meet the description of an industrial activity cover ed by Sectors A through AC. A facility that is not otherwise listed in Part V of this general permit is not eligible to apply for coverage under Sector AD, unless directed to do so in writing by the executive director. 3. Co-located Industrial Activities A facility operator is required to either obtain authorization under this general permit, under an individual TPDES stormwater permit, or under an alternative general permit if the facility meets one or more of the criteria listed in Part II, Section A.1.( a) above. If these facilities have additional activities that are described by a secondary SIC code that is listed in the table above, then these additional activities are described as co -located industrial activities. Stormwater discharges from co -located industrial activities may be authorized under this general permit provided that the operator complies with all of the sector specific requirements defined in Part V of this general permit for each of these co -located activities. The sector specific requir ements apply only to the portion of the facility where that specific sector of activity occurs, except where runoff from different activities combines before leaving the property. In cases where these discharges combine, the monitoring requirements and eff luent limitations from each sector that contributes runoff to the discharge must be met. 4. Co-located Industrial Facilities A facility operator is required to either obtain authorization under this general permit, under an individual TPDES stormwater permit, or under an alternative general permit if the facility meets one or more of the criteria in Part II, Section A.1.(a) above. Multiple industrial facilities may be described as \"co -located\" if they share a common property boundary. If authorization under th is general permit is sought, the operator of each of co -located facility must individually obtain authorization to discharge under this general permit. Multi Sector General Permit TPDES Gene ral Permit No. TXR050000 Part II, Section A Page 83 Each co -located facility will be issued a distinct authorization number. Each co -located industrial faci lity operator may either develop a separate stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWP3 or plan) or may participate in a shared SWP3. Co -located industrial facilities that develop a shared SWP3 must develop the SWP3 to meet the requirements stated in Parts III and V of this general permit, in addition to the following: (a) Participants . The SWP3 must clearly list the name and authorization number (when known) for each facility that participates in the shared SWP3. Each participant in the shared plan must sign th e SWP3 according to 30 TAC \u00a7305.128 (relating to Signatories to Reports.) (b) Responsibilities . The SWP3 must clearly indicate which permittee is responsible for performing each shared element of the SWP3. If the responsibility for performing an element is not described in the plan, then each permittee is entirely responsible for performing the element within the boundaries of its facility and in any common or shared area. The SWP3 must clearly describe responsibilities for meeting each element in shared or com mon areas. (c) Site Map. The site map must clearly delineate the boundaries around each co -located industrial facility and the boundaries around shared or common areas that are used by two or more facilities. Co-located facilities may alternatively obtain a co nditional exclusion based on no -exposure, in accordance with Part II, Section C. of this general permit, if applicable. 5. Requirements for Military Installations and Other Publicly -Owned Facilities (a) Stormwater discharges from military or other public installa tions or government institutions that conduct any industrial activities described by an SIC code or an industrial activity code that is listed in Part II, Section A.1. and Part V of this general permit, or that otherwise meet the conditions described in Pa rt II, Section A.1.(a) relating to the need for a permit, must either be authorized under this general permit, an individual TPDES stormwater permit, or an alternative general permit. For example, the SIC code of military installations is 9711 and the S IC code for universities is 82 21, neither of which are listed in this general permit; however, the need for a permit will be based on individual activities that occur at the installation. (b) Other publicly operated facilities (i.e., stand- alone facilities) that conduct activities described under Part II, Section A.1. of this general permit must meet the conditions of the general permit for those regula ted activities. For example, a city -operated landfill would be described by industrial activity code LF and would need a permit, and a county -operated bus maintenance facility would fall under SIC Code 4111 or 4173 and would also need a permit. However, th e general vehicle maintenance shop for a city 's motor pool would not typically be regulated unless the vehicles being maintained would classify the maintenance yard under an SIC code in the 4100 or 4200 series (for example if the city motor pool also maint ains the city's public transportation busses and the yard performs at least 50% of its maintenance activities on the city's public transportation busses) . 6. Non -Stormwater Discharges Industrial facilities that qualify for coverage under this general permit m ay discharge the following non -stormwater discharges through outfalls identified in the SWP3, according to the requirements of this general permit: (a) discharges from emergency firefighting activities ; Multi Sector General Permit TPDES Gene ral Permit No. TXR050000 Part II, Section B Page 84 (b) uncontaminated fire hydrant flushings (excluding discharg es of hyperchlorinated water, unless the water is first dechlorinated and discharges are not expected to adversely affect aquatic life); (c) potable water sources (excluding discharges of hyperchlorinated water, unless the water is first dechlorinated and disc harges are not expected to adversely affect aquatic life); (d) lawn watering and similar irrigation drainage, provided that all pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizer have been applied in accordance with the approved labeling; (e) water from the routine external w ashing of buildings, conducted without the use of detergents or other chemicals; (f) water from the routine washing of pavement conducted without the use of detergents or other chemicals and where spills or leaks of toxic or hazardous materials have not occurred (unless all spilled material has been removed); (g) uncontaminated air conditioner condensate, compressor condensate, and steam condensate, and condensate from the outside storage of refrigerated gases or liquids; (h) water from foundation or footing dra ins where flows are not contaminated with pollutants (e.g., process materials, solvents, and other pollutants); (i) uncontaminated water used for dust suppression; (j) springs and other uncontaminated groundwater ; (k) incidental windblown mist from cooling towers tha t collects on rooftops or adjacent portions of the facility, but excluding intentional discharges from the cooling tower (e.g., \"piped\" cooling tower blowdown or drains); and (l) other discharges described in Part V of this permit that are subject to effluent guidelines and effluent limitations. Section B. Limitations on Permit Coverage 1. Suspension or Revocation of Permit Coverage Authorization under this general permit may be suspended or revoked for cause. Filing a notice of planned changes or anticipated non- compliance by the permittee does not stay any permit condition. The permittee shall furnish to the executive director, upon request, any information necessary for the executive director to determine whether cause exists for revoking, suspending, or terminating autho rization under this permit. Additionally, the permittee shall provide to the executive director, upon request, copies of all records that the permittee is required to maintain as a condition of the permit. Failure to comply with any permit condition is a v iolation of the permit and the statutes under which it was issued, and is grounds for enforcement action, revoking coverage under this general permit, or requiring the permittee to apply for and obtain an individual TPDES permit or alternative general perm it. 2. Discharges Authorized by Another TPDES Permit Discharges authorized by an individual TPDES permit or another general TPDES permit may only be authorized under this TPDES general permit if all of the following conditions are met: Multi Sector General Permit TPDES Gene ral Permit No. TXR050000 Part II, Section B Page 85 (a) the discharges meet the applicability and eligibility requirements for coverage under this general permit; (b) the individual or alternative general permit does not contain numeric water quality - based effluent limitations for the discharge (unless industrial activities that resulted in the limitations have ceased and any contamination that resulted in these limitations has been removed or remediated); (c) specific BMP requirements of the current individual permit are continued as a provision of the SWP3; (d) the executive director has not de termined that continued coverage under an individual permit is required based on consideration of a TMDL model, anti -backsliding policy, history of substantive non -compliance or other considerations and requirements of 30 TAC Chapter 205, or other site -specific considerations; and (e) a previous application or permit for the discharges was not denied, terminated, or revoked by the executive director as a result of enforcement or water quality related concerns. The executive director may provide a waiver to this provision based on new circumstances at the facility or if the operations of the facility are the responsibility of a new operator. 3. Stormwater Discharges from Construction Activity Stormwater discharges associated with construction activities are not elig ible for authorization under this general permit. Discharges of stormwater that are regulated under this permit and that combine with stormwater from construction activities are not eligible for coverage under this general permit unless the construction si te runoff meets one of the following conditions: (a) authorization is under a separate TPDES permit; (b) authorization is under a separate NPDES permit; or (c) TPDES or NPDES permit coverage is not required . 4. Stormwater Discharges from Salt Storage Piles Stormwater that contacts salt storage piles (e.g., salt for deicing or other commercial or industrial purposes) may not be discharged to surface water in the state under authority of this general permit. Stormwater that contacts salt storage piles must be discharged under the authority of an individual TPDES permit or alternative general permit, or must be captured within a containment structure. Stormwater that contacts salt storage piles and is captured must either be disposed of in a manner that does not allow a discharge into or adjacent to water in the state, or in a manner otherwise approved by the executive director. The permittee(s) shall prevent exposure of salt storage piles, or piles containing salt, used for deicing or other commercial or industrial purposes, including maintenance of paved surfaces. This material must be enclosed or covered. Appropriate BMPs ( e.g., good housekeeping, diversions, containment) must be implemented to minimize exposu re resulting from adding to or removing materials from the pile(s). 5. Discharges of Stormwater Mixed with Non -Stormwater Stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity that combine with sources of non - stormwater are not eligible for coverage by th is general permit, unless either the non -Multi Sector General Permit TPDES Gene ral Permit No. TXR050000 Part II, Section B Page 86 stormwater source is described in Part II, Section A.6. of this permit or the non -stormwater source is authorized under a separate TPDES permit. 6. Compliance with Water Quality Standards Discharges that would cause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards, or that would fail to protect and maintain existing designated uses of receiving waters are not eligible for coverage under this general permit. The executive director may require an application for an individual permit or alternative general permit to authorize discharges of stormwater from any industrial facility that is determined to cause a violation of water quality standards or is found to cause, or contribute to, the loss of a designated use of receiving waters. 7. Impaired Water Bodies and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Requirements Discharges of the pollutant (s) of concern to impaired water bodies where there is a TMDL are not eligible for coverage under this permit, unless they are co nsistent wi th the EPA - approved TMDL. Permittees must incorporate the limitations, conditions, and requirements applicable to their discharges, including monitoring frequency and reporting required by TCEQ rules, into their SWP3 in order to be eligible for MSGP permit coverage. A discharge into an impaired water body is one where the discharge is directly to a water body that is either identified on the latest EPA- approved CWA Section 303(d) L ist, the Texas Integrated Report of Surface Water Quality for CWA Sections 3 05(b) and 303(d), or is covered by an EPA -approved TMDL. For stormwater that first enter s a storm sewer system prior to discharge, the determination is made by the identity of the first body of water the discharge enters upon exiting the storm sewer system. (a) The permittee shall determine whether the permitted authorized discharge is to an impaired water body on the latest EPA -approved CWA Section 303(d) List, or waters with an EPA -approved or established TMDL that are found on the latest EPA- approved Texas Integrated Report of Surface Water Quality for CWA Sections 305(b) and 303(d) as not meeting applicable Texas Surface Water Quality Standards. (b) New Discharges to Water Quality Impaired Water Bodies For a new discharge to an impaired water body, the permittee shall either: (1) Prevent exposure to stormwater of the pollutant(s) for which the water body is impaired (i.e., the pollutant(s) of concern), and retain on- site documentation of the preventive measures within the SWP3; (2) Document that the pollutant(s) for which the water body is impaired is/are not present in the regulated industrial activity at the site, and retain documentation of this finding in the SWP3 (e.g., if the pollutant of concern is bacteria, but the only identifiable source of bacteria tha t is wildlife occurring on the property, then the bacteria levels could be considered \"background\" for the purposes of this permit requirement); or (3) Obtain analytical data to support a showing that the discharge is not expected to cause or contribute to an exceedance of a water quality standard. The data and technical evaluation must demonstrate that the discharge of the pollutant of concern for which the water is impaired is below the level of concern (e.g. benchmark value). If the pollutant of concern is p resent above the level of concern , the permittee must follow the requirements in Part II, Section B.7.( b)(3)e. below. Data and supporting technical information must be retained with the SWP3. The Multi Sector General Permit TPDES Gene ral Permit No. TXR050000 Part II, Section B Page 87 permittee shall use the following method to demonstrate this finding, unless an alternate method is authorized by the TCEQ in writing: a. The permittee shall collect one or more representative sample(s) of stormwater in accordance with Part III, Section D.2. of this general permit, and analyze the sample(s) for the po llutant of concern (e.g., hazardous metals, bacteria, nutrients, etc.). For example, if the pollutant of concern is bacteria, the permittee shall sample for E. coli if discharging to fresh water, and enterococci if discharging to salt water. If the impairm ent is due to low dissolved oxygen (DO), the permittee shall monitor for BOD, COD, or both, based on the nature of the industrial activity, or in accordance with guidance provided by the TCEQ (e.g., information may be sent in writing directly to the permittee on request, or may be available on the TCEQ's TPDES stormwater webpages). If the impairment is due to nutrients, the permittee shall sample for total phosphorous if the discharge is to fresh water and for total nitrogen if the discharge is to salt wate r. If the impairment is due to a parameter for which there is not a clear analytical testing protocol (e.g., sediment, fish tissue, etc.), the permittee shall contact the TCEQ for guidance on which pollutant(s), if any, to monitor for, and the TCEQ will r espond in writing to the permittee. This documentation must be retained in the SWP3. b. If the facility operator is not able to collect a sample because the facility is not yet in operation, then the operator may submit an application to obtain coverage prior to sampling. The permittee shall collect the representative sample(s) from the first available discharge after commencing operation. c. The permittee shall compare the analytical results with the benchmark monitoring levels found in the facilit y's applicable sector located in Part IV of this general permit. Where a benchmark result is not available, the permittee shall compare the results to the water quality criteria in 30 TAC Chapter 307, or to the minimum analytical level (MAL). The pollutant is not considered to be present within the discharge when not detected above the MAL. The pollutant is considered below the level of concern when sampling results are below benchmark levels, the applicable water quality criteria, or natural background lev els. d. If the first year sampling results indicate that the discharge is below the level of concern or is not present in the discharge, then no additional sampling for the pollutant of concern is required. e. If sampling results indicate that the pollutant of c oncern is present in the discharge at a level of concern, then the permittee shall perform the following activities: (i) Monitor the discharge in accordance with Part III, Section B.4., \"Water Quality Monitoring Requirements,\" and (ii) Revise the SWP3 to address co ntrols that the permittee will utilize to reduce the discharge of the pollutant of concern. (4) A new discharge is not eligible for coverage under this permit for discharges to waters designated by the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards as Tier 3. Multi Sector General Permit TPDES Gene ral Permit No. TXR050000 Part II, Section B Page 88 (c) Existing Discharges to Impaired Water Bodies with an approved TMDL. An existing discharge to an impaired water body with an approved TMDL may only be authorized under this general permit if the permittee complies with additional controls required by the TCEQ in the TMDL, the TMDL Implementation Plan, or as otherwise directed by the e xecutive director in writing to the permittee. If the TMDL or TMDL Implementation Plan does not identify monitoring requirements for the permittee, then additional monitoring is not req uired under Part III.B.4(a) and the permittee may still obtain authorization under this general permit. (d) Existing Discharge to Water Quality Impaired Water Bodies without an approved TMDL. If the permittee discharges to an impaired water body without an approved TMDL, the permittee shall either: (1) Prevent exposure to stormwater of the pollutant(s) for which the water body is impaired (i.e., the pollutant(s) of concern), and retain on- site documentation of the preventive measures within the SWP3; (2) Document th at the pollutant(s) for which the water body is impaired is/are not present in the regulated industrial activity at the site, and retain documentation of this finding in the SWP3 (e.g., if the pollutant of concern is bacteria, but the only identifiable source of bacteria is wildlife occurring on the property, then the bacteria levels could be, for the purposes of this permit condition, considered \"background\" from a non- point source that is not regulated under this permit); or (3) Obtain analytical data to supp ort a showing that the discharge is not expected to cause or contribute to an exceedance of a water quality standard, using the steps in Paragraph II.B.7.( b)(3) above. a. If the results indicate that the discharge is below the level of concern or is not prese nt in the discharge, then no additional action is required. b. If the results indicate that the pollutant of concern is present in the discharge at a level that may contribute to water quality impairment (e.g., a result that is above the benchmark level for a pollutant as described in the facility's applicable sector located in Part V of this general permit), then the permittee shall implement an interim pollutant reduction plan (PRP) for the pollutant of concern. This PRP must be included in the SWP3 and must discuss the management practices and control measures that the permittee will implement to reduce, with the goal of eliminating, the discharge of pollutant(s) of concern that contribute to the impairment of the water body. The PRP must specifically identi fy control measures and practices that will collectively be used to try to eliminate the discharge of pollutant(s) of concern that contribute to the impairment of the water body and explain why these control measures and practices were chosen as opposed to other alternatives. (4) Beginning upon the date that the permittee is authorized for coverage under this permit, the permittee may not establish a new or increased discharge potentially containing a pollutant of concern to an impaired water body unless there is no exposure of the pollutant of concern to stormwater , the pollutant of concern is not present at the site nor in the discharge, or analytical data shows the pollutant of concern is not present at a level of concern as described in Part II, Sections B.7.( d)(1), (2), and (3) above. TCEQ may notify the permittee if additional control measures are necessary, or if an individual permit application is necessary. Multi Sector General Permit TPDES Gene ral Permit No. TXR050000 Part II, Section B Page 89 8. Discharges to the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone Discharges may not be authorized by this general p ermit where prohibited by 30 TAC Chapter 213 (relating to Edwards Aquifer). (a) For new discharges located within the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone, or within that area upstream from the recharge zone and defined as the Contributing Zone, operators must meet all applicable requirements of, and operate according to, 30 TAC Chapter 213 (Edwards Aquifer Protection Rule), in addition to the provisions and requirements of this general permit. (b) For existing discharges located within the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone , the requirements of the agency approved Water Pollution Abatement Plan under the Edwards Aquifer Rules are in addition to the requirements of this general permit. BMPs and maintenance schedules for structural stormwater controls, for example, may be requ ired as a provision of the rule. All applicable requirements of the Edwards Aquifer Protection Rule for reductions of suspended solids in stormwater runoff are in addition to the effluent limitation requirements and benchmark goals in this general permit f or this pollutant. A copy of the TCEQ approved Water Pollution Abatement Plan(s) that are required by the Edwards Aquifer Rule must be attached or referenced as a part of the SWP3. (c) For discharges located within ten stream miles upstream of the Edwards Aqui fer recharge zone, applicants shall also submit a copy of the NOI to the appropriate TCEQ regional office.

Discharges t o Specific Watersheds and Water Quality Areas Discharges of stormwater associated with industrial activity and other non -stormwater discharges may not be authorized by this general permit where prohibited by 30 TAC Chapter 311 (relating to Watershed Protection) for water quality areas and watersheds. 10. Endangered Species Act Discharges that would adversely affect a listed endangered or threatened aquatic or aquatic - dependent species or its critical habitat are not authorized by this permit, unless the requirements of the federal Endangered Species Act are satisfied . Federal requirements related to endangered species apply to all TPDES p ermitted discharges and site -specific controls may be required to ensure that protection of endangered or threatened aquatic or Multi Sector General Permit TPDES Gene ral Permit No. TXR050000 Part II, Section B Page 90 aquatic dependent species is achieved . If a permittee has concerns over potential impacts to listed species, the permittee may c ontact TCEQ for additional information. 11. Protection of Streams and Watersheds by Home -Rule Municipalities This general permit does not limit the authority of a home -rule municipality provided by the Texas Local Government Code \u00a7401.002. 12. Facilities with No Discharge to Surface Water in the State A facility that does not discharge stormwater to an MS4 nor to surface water in the state may not be required to obtain coverage under this general permit if the operator demonstrates that no discharges have occurred nor will occur in the future. The operator may be required to demonstrate, using engineering calculations or similar methods, that the facility will not discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity. Facilities that dispose of all stormwater associated with industrial activity by any of the following practices would not be required to obtain coverage for the stormwater under this general permit nor under an individual TPDES permit or alternative general permit: (a) Recycling of the stormwater with no resulting discharge into surface water in the state. (b) Pumping and hauling of the stormwater to an authorized disposal facility. (c) Discharge of the stormwater to a publicly- owned treatment works (POTW); however, this permit does not grant authorization to d ischarge into a POTW and the permittee would need to obtain authorization from the POTW operator to discharge stormwater into the POTW. (d) Underground injection of the stormwater in accordance with 30 TAC Chapter 331 (relating to Underground Injection Control ). (e) Discharge to above ground storage tanks with no resulting discharge into surface water in the state. (f) Containment of all stormwater within property boundari es, with no discharge into surface water in the state, including no discharge during, or as the result of, any storm event. 13. Automatic Authorization for Certain Industrial Activities Operators of the following industrial activities are designated for covera ge under this general permit, and are not required to prepare a SWP3, conduct analytical sampling, or submit an NOI for coverage nor an NEC application for a conditional exclusion based on no exposure . However, the facility operator must comply with all o ther requirements of Part III, Section E. of this general permit, related to Standard Permit Conditions; and must comply with Part II, Section C.1. of the permit related to maintaining \"no exposure\" of industrial activity to stormwater.

Multi Sector General Permit TPDES Gene ral Permit No. TXR050000 Part II, Section C Page 91 (c) Operators of small businesses who conduct a regulated activity described in Part II, Section A, wh ere the entire industrial activity is performed in a residential home, a shopping mall, or an office building, and all of the requirements listed below are met: (1) The industrial activity does not include the following industrial activity codes: HZ, LF, SE, or TW; (2) The industrial activity is conducted in an area inside the operator's primary residence home structure itself or inside another fully enclosed building, located within the property boundaries of the operator's primary residence (e.g., garage); (3) The regulated industrial activity is not exposed to stormwater; and (4) The facility operator complies with the requirements of Part III Section E. of this general permit, related to Standard Permit Conditions. However, the operator is not required to submit an NOI or an NEC application , conduct analytical monitoring for permit compliance, nor develop a SWP3. The facility operator must apply for coverage if any of the requirements listed above are not met. If the TCEQ determines that additional controls are re quired other than those listed above, or if there is a concern regarding the discharge of elevated levels of pollutants, then the TCEQ may require a facility otherwise eligible for automatic authorization to obtain coverage and meet all permit conditions t hrough submittal of an NOI or an individual permit application. 14. Transfer of Liability This permit does not transfer liability for the act of discharging without, or in violation of, a NPDES or a TPDES permit from the operator of the discharge to the permittee(s). 15. Force Majeure Nothing in Part II of the general permit is intended to negate any person's ability to assert the force majeure (act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe) defenses found in 30 TAC \u00a770.7. Section C. Obtaining Authorization to Di scharge 1. Conditional No Exposure Exclusion from Permit Requirements Facilities regulated under this general permit may be excluded from permit requirements if there is no exposure of industrial materials or activities (see Part I related to Stormwater Disch arges Associated with Industrial Activity) from precipitation or runoff. To qualify for a no exposure exclusion from permit requirements, the operator of the facility must provide certification that industrial activities and materials are isolated from sto rmwater by storm resistant shelters. The certification must be submitted to the TCEQ on a no exposure certification (NEC) application provided by the executive director, or using a format approved by the executive director. The facility is subject to inspe ction by authorized TCEQ personnel and MS4s with enforcement authority over MSGP regulated facilities within their jurisdiction to determine compliance with the no exposure exclusion. Facilities that qualify for this exclusion and that contribute stormwate r discharges to a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) shall provide copies of the certification to the operator of the MS4. (a) The following materials and activities are not required to be isolated from stormwater and stormwater runoff in order to mee t the no exposure exclusion: Multi Sector General Permit TPDES Gene ral Permit No. TXR050000 Part II, Section C Page 92 (1) drums, barrels, tanks, and similar containers that are tightly sealed, provided those containers are not deteriorated and do not leak (\"Sealed\" means banded or otherwise secured and with -out operational taps or valves); (2) final p roducts that are designed for outdoor use (e.g., new cars, outdoor play -sets, lawn equipment) provided the final products have not deteriorated or are otherwise a potential source of contaminants; (3) pallets used to store or transport final products intended for outdoor use, if the pallets are new or do not contain pollutants; (4) vehicles used in material handling that are adequately maintained to prevent leaking fluids; (5) lidded dumpsters containing waste materials, providing the containers are completely covered , nothing can drain out, and no material can be lost while loading the contents onto a garbage truck (excludes trash compactors unless located indoors or protected by a storm -resistant shelter); (6) industrial refuse and trash that is stored large roll -off co ntainers that are either located under a constructed cover or covered with heavy -duty tarps that are properly maintained and in good condition. The tarps must be securely fastened to the waste container in such a manner that the tarp has to be unfastened to add waste materials to the container and then refastened to the container; (7) particulate emissions from roof stacks or vents, provided they comply with other applicable TCEQ rules and do not contaminate stormwater ; and (8) above ground storage tanks (ASTs) t hat are equipped with valves for dispensing materials that support facility operations (e.g., heating oil, propane, butane, chemical feedstocks) or that dispense fuel (e.g. gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas) for delivery vehicles that support facil ity operations provided that: a. the ASTs must be physically separated from and not associated with vehicle maintenance operations areas; b. there are no leaks from pipes, pumps, or other equipment that could come into contact with stormwater ; and c. the ASTs are s urrounded by secondary containment (e.g., impervious berm, dike, or concrete retaining structure) to prevent exposure to stormwater runoff in the event of structural failure or leaks. ASTs that dispense fuel to vehicles that are used to support the regulated facility operations are not considered exposed . However, ASTs that distribute fuel to airplanes at a regulated air transportation facility are considered exposed unless located under storm resistant shelter. (b) The foll owing types of final products do not qualify for a certification of no exposure: (1) Products that could be mobilized by wind or rain into stormwater discharges (e.g., rock salt, wood chips or shavings, compost). Materials sheltered from precipitation may stil l be deemed exposed if the materials could be carried by wind; (2) products that may, when exposed, oxidize, deteriorate, leak or otherwise be a potential source of contaminants (e.g., scrap cars, scrap metal); or (3) \"final\" products that are actually \"intermedia te\" products used in the composition of yet another product (e.g., sheet metal, tubing and paint used in making tractors, Multi Sector General Permit TPDES Gene ral Permit No. TXR050000 Part II, Section C Page 93 unfinished portions of a final product, plastic pellets, glass to be installed in vehicles or buildings). Even if the intermediate pro duct is \"final\" for a manufacturer and is intended to be included in a \"final product intended for use outdoors,\" these products are still considered intermediate products and are considered to be exposed if located outdoors. Deposits of particles or resid uals from roof stacks or vents not otherwise regulated that could be carried by stormwater runoff and are considered exposed. Exposure also occurs when, as a result of particulate emissions, pollutants are visibly being \"tracked out\" or carried on the tire s of vehicles. (c) Limitations on eligibility for the no -exposure exclusion: (1) The exclusion from permit requirements is only available facility -wide, and is not available for individual outfalls. Generally, if any exposed industrial materials or activities ar e found on any portion of a facility, the facility is not eligible for the no - exposure exclusion. (2) If a facility with a conditional no -exposure exclusion undergoes any change(s) that result in industrial activities or materials becoming exposed, or if it is found that a facility does not (or no longer) meets the no exposure requirements, then the NEC exclusion that the facility is under ceases to apply. If this occurs, the operator of the facility covered (under an NEC) shall prepare a SWP3 and submit an NOI to apply for coverage under the MSGP or shall apply for an individual water quality permit (as applicable) to discharge stormwater from the facility before making any changes that will expose industrial activities or materials. Discharges that occur after losing the conditional no exposure exclusion are not authorized , unless permit coverage is re-established by filing an NOI for this permit or via an individual permit. The operator is required to submit a Notice of Termination (NOT) to terminate their NEC coverage. (3) If the TCEQ determines that a facility's stormwater discharges have a reasonable potential to cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, then the TCEQ may deny the no exposure exclusion. However, where a n MS4 oper ator has MSGP enforcement authority, it may inspect facilities within its jurisdiction for compliance with the no exposure certification (NEC). 2. Application for Coverage Applicants seeking authorization to discharge under this general permit shall submit a completed notice of intent (NOI) or a completed no exposure certification (NEC), as applicable, on a form approved by the executive director. Applications are not required for facilities that are automatically authorized by designation under this general permit. (a) Notices of Intent (NOIs) and No Exposure Certifications (NECs). (1) Electronic NOIs and NECs. Applicants must submit an NOI or NEC using the online e -permitting system available through the TCEQ website or request and obtain an electronic reporting wai ver. Electronic reporting waivers are not transferrable and expire on the same date as the authorization to discharge. Provisional authorization begins immediately following confirmation of receipt of the electronic NOI or NEC form by the TCEQ. (2) Paper NOIs and NECs. Applicants that are issued an electronic reporting waiver shall submit a paper NOI or NEC. Provisional authorization begins 48 hrs from Multi Sector General Permit TPDES Gene ral Permit No. TXR050000 Part II, Section C Page 94 the date that a completed NOI or NEC is postmarked for delivery to the TCEQ, unless otherwise notified in writing by the executive director. (3) Following review of the NOI or NEC, the executive director will: a. determine that the NOI or NEC is complete and confirm coverage by providing a written notification and an authorization number; or b. determine that the NOI or NEC is incomplete and request additional information needed to complete the NOI or NEC; or c. deny coverage in writing. Denial of coverage will be made in accordance with TCEQ rules at 30 TAC \u00a7205.4, related to Authorizations and Not ices of Intent. (b) Automatic Authorization. Facilities that meet the eligibility requirements for automatic authorization in Part II, Section B.1 3 are automatically authorized and are not required to submit an NOI for coverage or an NEC for conditional excl usion, provided that all of the technical requirements are met. Permit coverage for existing facilities automatically authorized under Part II, Section B.13 of this general permit begins immediately upon the effective date of this general permit; and permi t coverage for new facilities begins upon the commencement of industrial activities regulated under this general permit. 3. Application Deadlines (a) Existing Industrial Facilities. (1) Permittees who were authorized under the previous TPDES MSGP permit for discharge s associated with industrial activity (TXR050000, issued August 14, 2016) shall continue to operate under the provisions of that permit until authorization is obtained under this general permit, and may continue to do so for up to 90 days after the effecti ve date of this general permit. On or before the ninetieth (90th) day following the effective date of this general permit, existing permittees shall submit an application (NOI or NEC) for coverage under this general permit or shall comply with the automatic authorization option (in accordance with Part II, Section B.13. of this general permit). The executive director may grant a written request for extension for good cause if such written request is received no later than 15 days before the application dea dline (75 days following the permit effective date). (2) Facilities that were required to obtain permit coverage under the previous TPDES MSGP (issued August 14, 201 6) are considered to be existing facilities, regardless of whether an NOI or NEC was previously submitted under that general permit. The deadline for existing facilities that did not obtain coverage under the previous TPDES MSGP permit is immediately upon the effective date of this general permit. However, this permit does not prohibit a facility from submitting an NOI or NEC after the effective date of the general permit. (3) Permit coverage for facilities that do not renew permit coverage will expire 90 days following the effective date of this general permit. However, facilities that do not submit a n otice of termination on or before September 1, 20 21, will be considered active facilities on that date and will be assessed an annual fee for Fiscal Year 2022, as described in Part II, Section C.10.(b) below.

A transfer of ownership of a company includes changes to the structure of a company, such as changing from a partnership to a corporation or changing corporation types, so that the filing or charter number that is on record with the Texas Secreta ry of State (SOS) must be changed. See Part II, Section C.7.(a) below, related to Transfer of Operational Control. (2) Change in the physical location of the facility. Authorizations may not be transferred to a different location; therefore, if a facility mov es, the operator will need to submit an NOI for the new location and an NOT for the previous location. (h) Additional changes that may be made to the operator's SWP3 and that are not required to be submitted on an NOC include, but may not be limited to, the fo llowing: Change to other information on the site map that was not originally provided on the NOI (e.g., location of processing areas, loading areas, or best management practices). 7. Terminating Coverage (a) Submitting Notice of Termination (NOT). (1) A permittee mus t submit a NOT to the TCEQ to cancel coverage or to cancel a conditional exclusion based on no exposure. An NOT must be submitted in the following situations: a. An existing facility covered under an NOI changes operations such that a condition of no exposure is obtained. b. An existing facility with a conditional exclusion based on having no exposure of industrial activities changes operations such that a condition of no exposure no longer exists. The permittee must submit an NOI before a condition of exposure occurs, then must submit an NOT to terminate the existing exclusion. c. A facility that was covered under an NOI or an NEC is no longer doing business in the original location, and no industrial activities (e.g., manufacturing, processing, material storage, w aste material disposal areas and similar areas) remain or continue to be conducted at the site that would require permit coverage. An NOT must be submitted within 10 days after the facility ceases discharging stormwater associated with industrial activity. d. An operator that submitted an NOI or NEC obtains coverage under an individual permit or obtains coverage under an alternative general permit for stormwater discharges. An NOT must be submitted within 10 days after the operator obtains coverag e under the a lternative permit. e. A transfer of operational control occurs. The original operator who submitted the NOI or NEC must submit an NOT to cancel coverage or to cancel a conditional exclusion based on no exposure. Coverage under this general permit is not transferable. A transfer of operational control includes changes to the structure of a company, such as changing from a partnership to a corporation, or changing to a different corporation type such that a differen t filing (or charter) number is established with the Texas SOS . When the operator of a regulated industrial facility Multi Sector General Permit TPDES Gene ral Permit No. TXR050000 Part II, Section C Page 98 changes or operational control is transferred, the original operator must submit an NOT within 10 days prior to the date that responsibility for operations terminates, and the new operator must submit an NOI at least 10 days prior to the transfer of operational control. (2) Operators of regulated industrial activities who are designated as being automatically authorized by this general permit , and who are not required to submit an NOI or NEC, are not required to submit an NOT to terminate coverage. (b) NOT Form. (1) Electronic NOTs. P ermittees must submit an NOT using the online e -permitting system available through the TCEQ website unless the p ermittee requests and obtain s an electronic reporting waiver. (2) Paper NOTs. Permittees that are issued an electronic reporting waiver shall submit the NOT on a form approved by the executive director. (3) A copy of the NOT, submitted either electronically or by paper, must be provided to the operator of any MS4 receiving the discharge (if required by the MS4). (c) Effective Date of Termination of Coverage. Authorizatio n to discharge terminates immediately following confirmation of receipt of the electronic NOT by the TCEQ.

Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section A Page 101 Part III. PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS COMMON TO ALL COVERED INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES Section A. General Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3) Requirements 1. Implementation of SWP3 and Consistency with Other Plans (a) An applicant seeking au thorization under this general permit must develop and implement a new, or for existing permittees an updated , SWP3 before submitting an NOI for coverage. The SWP3 must be signed and certified in accordance with Part III, Section E.6.(c) of this general pe rmit, and must be maintained onsite and made readily available for review upon request by authorized TCEQ personnel as well as any local pollution control agency with jurisdiction . The SWP3 must be modified whenever necessary to address changing conditions at the site. Permittees who discharge stormwater to a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) shall also provide a copy of the SWP3 to the operator of that MS4 upon receiving a request from the MS4 operator. The SWP3 must be developed accord ing to the requirements of this general permit. At a minimum, the SWP3 must: (1) identify actual and potential sources of pollution that may reasonably be expected to affect the quality of stormwater discharges from the facility (see Part III, Section A.3.); (2) establish practices and any necessary control measures that will prevent or effectively reduce pollution in stormwater discharges from the facility and that ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of this general permit (see Part III, Section A.4.) ; (3) describe how the selected practices and controls are appropriate for the facility and how each will effectively prevent or reduce pollution (see Part III, Section A.4.); (4) describe how controls and practices interrelate to comprise an integrated, facility - wide approach for stormwater pollution prevention, including any useful references to literature or site -specific performance information on the selected controls and practices to demonstrate the appropriateness of each (see Part III, Section A.4.); (5) establ ish a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Team (team) and identify team members who will be responsible for developing and revising the SWP3 (see Part III, Section A.2); (6) provide a description of the facility that includes information about activities, material s, and physical features of the facility that may contribute pollutants to stormwater and any pollutant discharges that could occur during dry weather (see Part II I, Section A. 3.); and (7) document the monitoring and inspection procedures and schedules that wi ll be implemented at the site (see Part III, Section B). (b) Existing plans and measures that are developed based on other regulatory requirements, such as Spill Prevention Control Countermeasures (SPCC) plans that are Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section A Page 102 required for certain operations under the federal guidelines of 40 CFR Part 112, may satisfy in whole or in part specific requirements of this general permit. These plans or measures may either be attached as a component of the SWP3, or referenced in the SWP3 and made readily available for review upon request by authorized TCEQ personnel as well as any local pollution control agency with jurisdiction. 2. Stormwater Pollution Prevention Team The permittee shall establish a stormwater pollution prevention team (team). The SWP3 must be kept readily avai lable to the members of the team. (a) Members of the Team. The SWP3 must identify the members of the team by name and by title, and must list and clearly identify the responsibilities of each team member. The team may consist of a single individual or a group of individuals as appropriate for the facility. Additional members of the team may include environmental professionals that are under contract to the permittee. If the facility is not staffed on a continuous or permanent basis, then company employee(s) from outside of the facility may be identified as a part of the team. If it is not feasible to provide the name of each team member, then the SWP3 may identify a position or positions within the organization that comprise the team. Members of the organization or the ranking employees or exe cutive officers at the facility must be able to identify the particular individual(s) comprising the team. (b) Responsibility of the Team. The team is responsible for development of the SWP3 and for assisting the operator or the operator's designee in the impl ementation, maintenance, and revision of the SWP3. 3. Description of Potential Pollutants and Sources The SWP3 must identify and describe all activities and significant materials that may potentially be pollutant sources. The SWP3 must include, at a minimum: (a) Inventory of Exposed Materials. An inventory must be developed that lists materials currently handled at the facility that may be exposed to precipitation or runoff in a drainage area of an outfall covered under this permit . The list must include all mater ials that are handled, stored, processed, treated, or disposed of in a manner that would allow exposure to precipitation or runoff. Materials stored in drums, barrels, tanks, and similar containers that are tightly sealed, in good structural condition, and do not have leaking valves are not required to be listed in the inventory. The inventory of materials must include specific pollutants that maybe attributed to those materials. For facilities subject to reporting requirement under EPCRA \u00a7313, the SWP3 mus t list all potential pollutant sources for which they have reporting requirements under EPCRA \u00a7313. The inventory must be updated within 30 days following a significant change in the types of materials that are exposed to precipitation or runoff, or signif icant changes in material management practices that may affect the exposure of materials to precipitation or runoff. A significant change in the types of materials is exposure of a material, not already included in the inventory that could be transported b y precipitation or stormwater runoff and subsequently discharged. A significant change in material management practices is a change that would result in either initial exposure of a material not already listed in the inventory or increased exposure of a material to the extent that the material could be transported by precipitation or stormwater runoff and subsequently discharged. Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section A Page 103 (b) Narrative Description. The SWP3 must include a narrative description that describes all activities and potential sources of pollu tants that may reasonably be expected to add pollutants to stormwater discharges, or that may result in dry weather discharges from the storm sewer system. This description must include locations and sources of runon to the site from adjacent property, and an indication if significant quantities of pollutants are present in the runon. Examples include the following activities and potential sources when they are exposed to stormwater : (1) loading, unloading, and material transfer areas; (2) outdoor storage areas; (3) outdoor processing areas; (4) dust producing activities; (5) on-site waste disposal areas; (6) vehicle/equipment maintenance, cleaning, and fueling areas; (7) liquid storage tank areas; (8) railroad sidings, tracks, and rail cars; (9) storage piles containing salt used for deicing or other commercial or industrial purposes; (10) locations where potential spills and leaks could occur that could contribute pollutants to stormwater discharges; and (11) locations where all significant spills and leaks (for example, reportable quantity spills an d spills or leaks that have the potential to cause impacts on water quality) of oil or toxic or hazardous pollutants occurred at exposed areas that drained to a stormwater conveyance in the three (3) years prior to the date the SWP3 was prepared or amended . For each pollutant or material listed in the Inventory of Exposed Materials, the direction of flow or potential flow to the final permitted outfalls must be identified in the SWP3. The outfall and direction of flow must either be narratively described or identified by referencing the location on the site map. Areas of the facility that have a high potential for significant soil erosion, due to topography, activities, or other factors, must also be identified and either narratively described or identified by referencing the location on the site map. The narrative description must be updated within 30 days following a change in the types or quantities of materials exposed to precipitation or runoff that, in the judgment of the stormwater pollution prevention team, may reasonably be expected to add poll utants to stormwater discharges. The narrative description must be updated to describe changes in material management practices or other factors that may affect the exposure of materials to precipitation or runoff.

The SWP3 must conta in a general location map (e.g., USGS quadrangle map) with enough detail to identify the location of the facility, including all surface waters that could potentially receive the stormwater discharges from the site. For sites with large plots of lands where no industrial activity is conducted, the map must also depict those areas. However, no outfall(s) needs to be assigned for those Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section A Page 104 areas, if they only discharge stormwater that has not been in contact with industrial activity. (d) Drainage Area Site Map. A site map(s) must be developed that depict(s) the following: (1) the location (latitude and longitude) of each outfall covered by the permit and the location (latitude and longitude) of each sampling point (if different from the outfall location); (2) an outline of the facility's drainage area that shows the direction of the stormwater flow, and the location of all stormwater conveyances (e.g., ditches, gutters, pipes, swales) that drain to each permitted outfall; (3) connections or discharges to MS4(s); (4) locations of all structures (e.g. buildings, garages, storage tanks, fueling stations, machinery) and impervious surfaces (e.g., parking lots, paved or concrete pads); (5) structural control devices designed to reduce pollution in stormwa ter runoff; (6) process wastewater treatment units (including ponds); (7) bag house and other air treatment units exposed to stormwater; (8) the surface area of the facility (i.e., size in acres or square feet) , or a clear scale such that the approximate surface area may be calculated ; (9) locations of all receiving waters, including wetlands, and information as to whether they are impaired or have established TMDLs; (10) vehicle and equipment maintenance areas; (11) physical features of the site that may influence stormwater runof f or contribute a dry weather flow; (12) locations and descriptions of all non- stormwater discharges; (13) locations where reportable quantity spills or leaks have occurred during the three (3) years before the NOI is submitted to obtain coverage under this general permit; (14) locations and sources of runon to the site from adjacent property that contain s significant quantifies of pollutants ; (15) processing, storage, and material loading/unloading areas; and (16) any additional locations where significant materials are exposed t o precipitation or runoff. The site map must clearly show the flow of stormwater runoff from each of these locations so that the final outfall(s) where the discharge leaves the facility's boundary is apparent. A series of maps must be developed if the amou nt of information would cause a single map to be difficult to read and interpret. (e) Spills and Leaks. The SWP3 must contain a list of reportable quantity spills that occurred in areas exposed to stormwater, or that occurred within the drainage area that cont ributes to an outfall, during the three (3) years before the NOI was submitted. The list must be updated on a quarterly basis and must include all additional spills and leaks that could contribute pollutants to stormwater discharges (in addition to the previously listed spills of \"reportable quantity\" only). The updated list may be limited to spills and leaks that have occurred within the previous five (5) years. Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section A Page 105 (f) Sampling Data. All data from the laboratory analyses of stormwater discharge samples must be summarized. The summary must be updated on an annual basis to include the results of all additional analyses. The data summary must either be included as an attachment to the SWP3 or may be referenced and maintained separately. The data summary must be read ily available for review upon request by authorized TCEQ personnel as well as any local pollution control agency with jurisdiction. 4. Pollution Prevention Measures and Controls The permittee shall implement all pollution prevention practices that are determi ned to be necessary, reasonable, and effective by the stormwater pollution prevention team, or that are required by a state or local authority, that are necessary to protect the water quality in receiving waters, or that are necessary to remain compliant w ith this general permit. The SWP3 must include detailed descriptions of the following minimum components and a schedule for implementation: (a) Best Management Practices (BMPs). A section within the SWP3 must be developed to establish BMPs to reduce the discharge and potential discharge of pollutants in stormwater and to minimize exposure of areas of the site with industrial activity to stormwater. The location and type of BMPs or control measures that have been adopted or installed must be documented in the SWP3. Development of BMPs must be based on the activities and potentials for contamination that are identified in Part III, Section A.4. of t his permit. Examples of BMPs that the permittee may use to comply with this section include the following : (1) use grading, berming, or curbing when possible to prevent runoff of contaminated flows and to divert runon away from these areas; (2) locate materials, equipment, and activities in such a way that leaks are contained in existing containment and diversion systems; (3) clean up spills and leaks promptly using dry methods (e.g., absorbents) to prevent the discharge of pollutants; (4) use drip pans and absorbents under or around leaky vehicles and equipment or store indoors where feasible; (5) use spill/overflow protection equipment; (6) drain fluids from equipment and vehicles prior to on -site storage or disposal; (7) perform cleaning operations indoors, within storm resis tant shelters, or within bermed areas that prevent runoff and runon and that also capture overspray; (8) ensure that waste, garbage, and floatable debris are not discharged to receiving waters, by keeping exposed areas free of such materials or by interceptin g them before they are discharged; (9) minimize generation of dust and off- site tracking of raw materials, intermediate products, final products, or waste materials; and (10) divert, infiltrate, reuse, contain, or otherwise reduce stormwater runoff, in order to minimize pollutants in discharges. (b) Good Housekeeping Measures. A section within the SWP3 must be developed to ensure that areas of the facility that contribute or potentially contribute pollutants to stormwater discharges (e.g., areas around trash dumpsters , storage areas, loading Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section A Page 106 docks, and outdoor processing areas) are maintained in a clean and orderly manner. Good housekeeping measures must include measures to eliminate or reduce exposure of garbage and refuse materials to precipitation or runoff prior to their disposal. Typical good housekeeping measures include activities that are performed on a daily basis by employees during the course of normal work activities. The good housekeeping measures must be incorporated as a part of the employee training prog ram. (c) Plastic Materials Requirements. Facilities that handle pre -production plastic must develop and include in the SWP3 activities that will be implemented to ensure that areas of the facility that can contribute plastic pollutants to stormwater discharges (e.g. areas around containers holding plastic materials, plastic storage areas, loading docks where plastics are present, and outdoor areas where plastic materials may be present) are maintained in a clean and orderly manner. Good housekeeping measures must include measures to prevent exposure of plastics and other plastic pre-production materials to precipitation or runoff prior to their use in further pro cessing or disposal. Plastic material s required to be addressed as stormwater pollutants at a minimum include the following: virgin and recycled plastic resin pellets, powders, flakes, powdered additives, regrind, scrap, waste, and recycling materi al with the potential to dischar ge or migrate off -site. Facilities that handle pre -production plastic must implement BMPs to eliminate discharges of plastic in stormwater through the implementation of control measures such as the following, where determined feasib le (list not exclusive): minimizing spills, cleaning up spills promptly and thoroughly, sweeping and/or vacu uming thoroughly, and pellet capturing. (d) Erosion and Sedimentation Control Measures. A section within the SWP3 must be developed to address soil erosion and sedimentation. The permittee shall evaluate and use appropriate measures and controls to reduce soil erosion and sedimentation in areas of the facility with demonstrated or potential soil erosion and sedimentation. Potential use of the following co ntrols must be evaluated, at a minimum: soil stabilization through vegetative cover; contouring slopes; paving; and installation of structural controls. (e) Structural Controls (1) Physical structures may be used in conjunction with other pollution prevention meas ures and controls, as necessary, to reduce pollutants in stormwater discharges. Examples of structural controls that may be used include vegetated swales, oil/water separators, settling ponds, catch basins, berms, and other physical structures. (2) Velocity Di ssipation Devices. Discharge velocities must be controlled to the extent necessary to prevent the destruction of the natural physical characteristics of receiving waters by erosion. Velocity dissipation devices may be constructed at discharge points or alo ng channels and other stormwater collection areas that lead to outfalls. Management alternatives to minimize runoff, such as limiting impervious cover, may also be considered. (3) A section within the SWP3 must be developed to establish a maintenance program for stormwater structural controls. These controls must be inspected on a regular basis and maintenance frequencies must be established for each of the controls at intervals that ensure effective operation. Mechanical equipment that is part of a structural control, such as a stormwater pump, must also be inspected at intervals described in the SWP3 and maintained at intervals necessary to prevent failures that could result in a discharge of pollutants. Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section A Page 107 This section of the SWP3 must identify qualified personn el to conduct inspections and establish inspection and maintenance schedules. Records must document the estimated volumes of solids removed from catch basins, sediment ponds, and other similar control structures. (f) Spill Prevention and Response Measures. A s ection within the SWP3 must be developed and implemented to prevent spills and to provide for adequate spill response. This section must: (1) identify areas where spills could contribute pollutants to stormwater discharges; (2) develop and implement procedures to minimize or prevent contamination of stormwater from spills; (3) require drums, tanks, and other containers to be clearly labeled; (4) clearly mark hazardous waste containers that require special handling, storage, use, and disposal; (5) develop and implement specific spill prevention, detection, and clean up procedures and techniques; (6) develop procedures to notify appropriate facility personnel, emergency response agencies, public health, or drinking water supply agencies and other regulatory agencies of a repo rtable quantity spill or other release of oil or a hazardous substance; (7) make available to facility personnel materials and equipment necessary for spill clean- up; (8) develop and maintain an inventory of spill cleanup materials and equipment; and (9) incorporate t hese measures as a part of the employee training program.

Non -stormwater discharges eligible for coverage are described in Part II, Section A.6. of this general permit and in the individual sections within Part V of this general permit. The permittee shall identify and evaluate all non- stormwater discharges that qual ify for permit coverage. The SWP3 must include a list of the non -stormwater discharges at the facility, as well as the results of this evaluation. (b) Investigation for Non -Stormwater Discharges. Within 180 days of filing an NOI for coverage (or a renewal NOI) the permittee shall conduct a survey of potential non - stormwater sources and shall provide the certification required in Part III, Section B.1.(c) below. The facility's storm sewer system must be tested or inspected (e.g., screened for dry weather flows) for the presence of non -stormwater flows. Procedures must be evaluated and implemented to eliminate any potential sources that are discovered and are not permitted. The SWP3 must ensure that non -stormwater sources are not combined with stormwater discharge s authorized by this permit unless otherwise allowable under Part II.B.5. of this general permit. The SWP3 must be updated based on this evaluation to include the following: (1) the date that the evaluation occurred and description of the criteria used for evaluation; (2) the outfalls or onsite discharge points observed; (3) the different types of identified non -stormwater discharges and their source locations; and (4) appropriate BMPs for the non -stormwater discharges, or the actions taken or the control measures used to eliminate them.

The SWP3 must include a certification, signed according to Part III, Section E.6.(c) of this general permit, relating to Signatory Requirements for Reports and Certi fications, that states that the facility's storm sewer system has been evaluated for the presence of non - stormwater discharges and that the discharge of non -permitted, non -stormwater does not occur. The certification must include documentation of how the evaluation was conducted, results of any testing, dates of evaluations or tests, and the portions of the storm sewer system that were observed during the inspection. The inspection for non - stormwater discharges must be completed and the certification must be prepared within 180 days after filing an NOI for permit coverage. The certification must be made readily available for review upon request by authorized TCEQ personnel as well as any local pollution control agency with jurisdiction . (d) Failure or Inability to Certify. (1) If a part of the storm sewer system cannot be accessed to complete the evaluation, certification must be provided for the remainder of the system. Notice of this inability to certify a portion of the storm sewer system must be provided to the TCEQ within 180 days after the NOI is submitted. Operators of facilities that contribute stormwater discharges to an MS4 shall provide notice of this inability to certify a portion of the storm sewer system to the MS4 operator upon request from the MS4 ope rator. The notice must include an explanation of why the evaluation could not be performed and a list of all known potential, non- permitted, non - stormwater sources that could not be included in the certification. The notification must be submitted to the TCEQ's Enforcement Division (MC -224). (2) If, in the course of evaluating the storm sewer system, the permittee is unable to certify that non- permitted, non -stormwater discharges are not occurring due to non- compliance , then the certification must identify the non- compliance issues and the steps being taken to remedy and prevent further non- compliance. 2. Routine Facility Inspections Qualified personnel, who are familiar with the industrial activities performed at the facility, shall conduct periodic routine facility inspections to determine the effectiveness of the Pollution Prevention Measures and Controls (Part III, Section A. 4.). These inspections must include at least one member of the stormwater pollution prevention team.

For the following pollutants of concern, monitoring must be conducted for the following alternative pollutant s, unless an alternate is approved in writing by TCEQ 's Wastewater Permitting Section (MC - 148), or the T CEQ develops separate written guidance: Pollutant(s) of Concern: Bacteria : E.coli (for discharge to fresh water); or enterococci (for discharges to marine waters). Dissolved Oxygen : BOD5, COD, or both (based on the nature of the industrial activity, and whether there is an existing benchmark sampling requirement for the facility's industrial sector) . Nutrients : Phosphorous (for discharges to fresh water); or Nitrogen (for discharges to marine waters), unless otherwise established in an appli cable TMDL or TMDL Implementation Plan. Hazardous Metals : Specific metal(s) listed in the CWA 303 (d) List or the TMDL . Other : If the impairment is due to a parameter for which there is not an obvious analytical test or benchmark value (e.g., sediment, fish tissue, etc.), the permittee shall contact the TCEQ for guidance on which pollutant(s) to monitor for, if any, and the Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section B Page 113 TCEQ will respond in writing. The permittee shall retain this information with the SWP3. The permittee may utilize the analytical result s of sampling for other sections of this general permit to comply with this annual sampling requirements (e.g., hazardous metals sampling in Part III, Section C, or benchmark monitoring in Parts IV and V of this general permit). (d) Sampling, monitoring, and analyses must be conducted according to procedures specified in Part III, Section E.4 of this permit unless otherwise specified and using test procedures with minimum analytical levels (MALs) at or below benchmark values for all the benchmark parameters for which sampling is required.

The r esults for the pollutant(s) of concern must be submitt ed online using the Network Discharge Monitoring Report ( NetDMR ) reporting system available through the TCEQ website unless the permittee requested and obtained an electronic reporting waiver. (f) If sampling results indicate that the pollutant is present belo w the level of concern (e.g., the analytical result is below the benchmark values in Part V of this permit) or is not present (e.g., analytical result is below the MAL), then the permittee may discontinue sampling under this section for the remainder of th e permit term. 5. Annual Comprehensive Site Compliance Inspection The comprehensive site compliance inspection is a required site evaluation and an overall assessment of the effectiveness of the current SWP3. This inspection is in addition to other routine inspections required by the permit; however, it may substitute for a routine facility inspection if it is conducted during the regularly scheduled period of the routine facility inspection and the scope of the inspection is sufficient enough to add ress both the minimum requirements of the routine inspection and the comprehensive site compliance inspection. (a) General Requirements. The comprehensive site compliance inspection must be conducted at least once each permit year by one or more qualified empl oyees or designated representatives, including at least one member of the stormwater pollution prevention team.

Numeric Effluent Limitations This section describes two types of numeric effluent limitations. Numeric effluent limitations for hazardous metals and numeric effluent limitations for stormwater discharges subject to federal effluent limitations guidelines. 1. Numeric Limitations for Hazardous Metals All permittees are required to monitor for hazardous metals, unless they qualify for a waiver as described in item ( c) below. Monitoring results are kept onsite and are only submitted to TCEQ, when results exceed the daily maximum effluent limi tation values in Table 1 below. Table 1. Daily Maximum Effluent Limitation Parameter (Total) Discharges to Inland Waters (mg/L) Discharge s to Tidal Water s (mg/L) Monitoring Frequency Arsenic 0.3 0.3 1/Year Barium 4.0 Cadmium 0.2 1/Year Chromium 5.0 5.0 1/Year Copper 2.0 2.0 1/Year Lead 1.5 1.5 1/Year Manganese 3.0 3.0 1/Year Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section C Page 116 Parameter (Total) Discharges to Inland Waters (mg/L) Discharge s to Tidal Water s (mg/L) Monitoring Frequency Mercury 0.01 0.01 1/Year Nickel 3.0 3.0 1/Year Selenium 0.2 0.3 1/Year Silver 0.2 0.2 1/Year Zinc 6.0 6.0 1/Year (a) Sampling for Hazardous Metals . A grab sample must be collected at a minimum frequency of once per year at the final outfall or a designated sampling location (also see Part III, Section D.2. ). For the purpose of collecting samples for hazardous metals, all designated sampling points must be representative of the discharge(s) from the facility that would reach surface water in the state. (1) Samples of discharges collected at the final outfall must be collected either immediately prior to entering surface water in the state or immediately prior to leaving the permitted facility property. (2) Samples of discharges collected at a designated sampling point must be collected in accordance with the requirements in Part III, Section E.4. of this permit. A designated sampling point m ust be established when it can be determined that samples taken at a final outfall, as described in item ( 1) above, would not be considered representative of the discharge from the facility. (3) If there is not an obvious outfall location, a designated sampling point may need to be created in accordance with the requirement in Part III, Section E.4.(a) of this permit. (b) Reporting Requirements for Hazardous Metals . (1) Monitoring must for Hazardous Metals be conducted prior to December 31 for each annual monitoring period and the results must be reported as required in Part III, Section E.6. A copy of the discharge moni toring report ( DMR ) must either be retained at the facility or must be made readily avail able for review upon request by authorized TCEQ personnel as well as any local pollution control agency with jurisdiction by March 31 following the annual monitoring period. (2) Results of monitoring for determining compliance with numeric effluent limitation s must be kept onsite and recorded on a DMR. The DMR must either be a copy of record from the NetDMR system, an original EPA No. 3320 -1 form, a duplicate of the form, or as otherwise provided by the executive director. (3) Analytical results that exceeds the effluent limitations , listed above in Table 1 , are a permit violation and must be submitted electronically using the online NetDMR reporting system available through the TCEQ website , unless the permittee requests and obtains an electronic reporting waiver. Permittees that are issued an electronic reporting waiver shall submit analytical results to the TCEQ Enforcement Division (MC -224) on an approved DMR form (EPA No. 3320 -1), a duplicate of the form, or as otherwise provided by the executive director. Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section C Page 117 (4) Results that exceeds one or more of the numeric limitations listed above in Table 1, must be reported by March 31 following the annual monitoring period in which the violation(s) occurred. (c) Waiver from Hazardous Metals Monitoring . Permittees qualify for a waiver from monitoring requirements for one or more hazardous metal s if one of the following criteria is met, and the waiver is obtained by certifying the conditions exist. The criteria under which the waiver is claimed, must also be identified in the SWP3 . This certification must be completed on a form provided by the executive director. A new form must be completed during each permit term, no later than prior to the first sampling event that the permittee is seeking to waive. The form must be either main tained onsite or made readily available for review upon request by authorized TCEQ personnel as well as any local pollution control agency with jurisdiction . Waivers may be obtained on a metal by metal basis, or on an outfall by outfall basis as follows: (1) the permittee certifies that the regulated facility does not use a raw material, produce an intermediate product, or produce a final product that contains one (1) or more of the hazardous metals listed in Table 1 above ; or (2) the permittee certifies that any raw materials, intermediate products, or final products that contain one or more hazardous metal are never exposed to stormwater or runoff (final products are not considered to expose hazardous metals to stormwater or runoff if the final product is designe d for outdoor use, unless it is a product that could be transported by stormwater runoff or the final product will be used as a material or intermediate product); or (3) the permittee collects a sample from the first available discharge from the facility occur ring during first sampling period of this permit, analyzes the sample for one or more of the listed hazardous metals, and the results indicate that the metal(s) is/are not present in detectable levels. Test methods used must be sensitive enough to detect the following parameters at the MAL specified below, and results of sampling must be retained on site and available for review by TCEQ personnel: Table 2. Minimum Analytical Levels (MAL) for Hazardous Metals Pollutants MAL (mg/L) Arsenic, total 0.0005 Barium, total 0.003 Cadmium, total Manganese, 05 Mercury, total 0.000 005 Nickel, total 0.002 Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section C Page 118 Pollutants MAL (mg/L) Selenium, total 0.005 Silver, total 0.00 05 Zinc, total 0.005 When an analysis of a discharge sample for any of the parameters listed above indicates no detectable levels above the MAL, and the test method detection level is as sensitive as the specified MAL, a value of zero (0) may be used for th at measurement, and a waiver may be obtained for the duration of the permit term following the sample collection, for any hazardous metal that measures zero (0). (4) Hazardous metals monitoring waivers are effective beginning on the date that the waiver certif ication is made following submittal of an NOI and lasting for the duration of the term of this general permit. The permittee will be required to comply with any requirements of a reissued general permit with respect to sampling and waivers, including obtai ning a new hazardous metals monitoring waiver (see the criteria listed above). (d) Relation to Benchmark Monitoring. If a facility is required to sample for any of the above hazardous metals as part of the benchmark requirements in Part V, then the permittee is subject to the effluent limitations listed in Tab le 1 above for those hazardous metals sampled at a final outfall as part of benchmark monitoring. There ar e no waivers available for pollutants that are required in Part V of the general permit. If sampling for benchmark metals is not performed at a final outfall, then the above effluent limits may not apply for the benchmark sample if the sample is not repres entative of the discharge from the site. In this situation, the discharge must also be sampled at each final outfall to comply with the sampling and analyses requirements of this section. 2. Discharges Subject to Federal Categorical Guidelines Part V of this general permit includes additional effluent limitations for certain stormwater discharges as required under 40 CFR Subchapter N Parts 400 -471. Only those stormwater discharges identified in Table 3 below are eligible for coverage under this permit. The permittee is subject to the sampling and reporting requirements as stipulated below, along with the applicable sections of Part III, Section D, and Part V . Table 3.

(b) Reporting Requirements for Sector Specific Numeric Effluent Limitations Guidelines . Monitoring for compliance with numeric effluent limitat ions guidelines in this section and in Part V is subject to the following requirements: (1) Results of monitoring must be submitted online using the NetDMR reporting system available through the TCEQ website unless the permittee requests and obtains an electronic reporting waiver. Permittees that are issued an electronic reporting waiver shall submit analytical results to the TCEQ Enf orcement Division (MC -224) on an approved DMR form (EPA No. 3320 -1), a duplicate of the form, or as otherwise provided by the executive director. (2) Monitoring must be conducted prior to December 31 for each annual monitoring period and the results must be submitte d to TCEQ by March 31 of the following year, as described in Part III, Section E.6. of this permit. (3) In addition, a copy of the DMR must eith er be retained at the facility or must be made readily available for review upon request by authorized TCEQ personnel as well as any local pollution control agency w ith jurisdiction my March 31 following the annual monitoring period. Section D. General Monitoring an d Records Requirements 1. Qualifying Storm Events For purposes of the MSGP, a qualifying storm even t is an event that results in a discharge from the permitted facility. For qualifying storm events, the following requirements apply: (a) Monitoring, sampling, examinations, and inspections of stormwater discharges that are required as a provision of this general permit must be conducted on discharges from a measureable storm event that results in an actual discharge from the site, and that follows the preceding mea surable storm event by at least 72 hours (3 days). The 72 - hour storm interval does not apply if the permittee is able to document in the SWP3 that less than a 72 -hour (3 -day) interval is representative for local qualifying storm Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section D Page 120 events during the sampling period. In the case of snowmelt, the monitoring must be performed at a time when a measurable discharge occurs at the site. (b) A facility that has retention ponds as BMPs will not always have a discharge from the pond(s) immediately following a qualifying st orm event. If any storm events occurred prior to discharge from the outfall, regardless of the time period between the last storm event and the discharge, the permittee may consider the discharge to be the result of the previous qualifying storm event. (c) The permittee shall maintain an on- site rain gauge , a representative weather station, or subject to TCEQ's approval, an alternative means of compliance to determine when a qualifying storm event occurs. The on-site rain gauge , representative weather station, or the alternative means of compliance must be monitored a minimum of once per week, and once per day during storm events. Records of the date and rainfall total must be retained on -site or made readily available for review. If there is no rain during a given week, the permittee shall monitor and record a zero rainfall total or no rain for the week. M onitoring and recordkeeping of the on -site rain gauge, representative weather station, or the alternative means of compliance may be temporarily suspended duri ng a given monitoring period if a qualifying storm event has occurred and the required sampling and analyses or visual observations have been performed. 2. Representative Discharge Samples (a) All samples must be representative of the discharge. (1) Sampling should b e conducted within the first 30 minutes of discharge using a grab sample. Sampling from retention ponds described in Part III, Section D.1.b. above should be conducted within 30 minutes of the initiation of discharge from the pond. If it is not practicable to collect the sample or to complete the sampling within the first 30 minutes, then sampling must be completed within the first hour of discharge. If sampling is not completed within the first 30 minutes of discharge, the reason must be documented and att ached to all required reports and records of the sampling activity. In the case of snowmelt, samples must be taken during a period with a measurable discharge. (2) If alternate sampling requirements are defined in the permit where numeric effluent limitations have been established, the permittee shall comply with the requirements described in the section with the numerical effluent limits; however, other applicable portions of this section will still apply. (3) Authorized Stormwater Discharges that Comb ine with Other Permitted Flows. If stormwater discharges authorized under this general permit combine with other stormwater or with wastewater authorized under a separate permit, then sampling must be conducted at a point before the waters combine. (4) Non -Stormwater Discharges. Monitoring of allowable non- stormwater discharges is only required when they are commingled with stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity. (b) Representative Discharges from Substantially Similar Outfalls. (1) Monitoring requir ements apply to all outfalls authorized by this permit, unless the permittee establishes substantially similar outfall(s). If discharges of stormwater Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section D Page 121 through two (2) or more outfalls show substantially similar effluen ts, then sampling and monitoring may be conducted at only one (1) of those outfalls that are substantially similar , and the results may be reported as representative of the discharge from the substantially similar outfall(s). Before results may be submitted as representative of discharges from substantially similar outfalls, the permittee shall ensure that the SWP3 includes a description of all outfall locations and a detailed justification of why the discharge qualities from the outfalls are substantially si milar. To determine if outfalls are substantially similar, the following characteristics of each outfall must be compared: a. the industrial activities that occur in the drainage area to each outfall; b. significant materials stored or handled within the drainag e area to each outfall; and c. the management practices and pollution control structures that occur within the drainage area of each outfall. (2) Substantially similar outfalls may be established for the following monitoring requirements described in this general permit: a. Quarterly Visual Monitoring (Part III, Section B.3); b. Hazardous Metals Monitoring (Part III, Section C); and c. Benchmark Monitoring (Parts IV and V) (3) Substantially similar outfalls may not be established for the following: a. Outfalls with any non- stormw ater discharges; and b. Outfalls with discharges subject to numeric effluent limits listed in Part V (sector -specific effluent limits). (4) The following information must be documented in the SWP3 if the substantially similar outfall exception is being used for any required monitoring: a. location of each of the substantially similar outfalls; b. description of the general industrial activities conducted in the drainage area of each outfall; c. description of the control measures implemented in the drainage area of eac h outfall; d. description of the exposed materials located in the drainage area of each outfall that are likely to be significant contributors of pollutants to stormwater discharges; e. estimate of the runoff coefficient of the drainage areas; f. explanation reg arding why the outfalls are expected to discharge substantially similar effluents; and g. assurance that control measures have been assessed and modified as appropriate for each outfall represented by the monitored outfall, if necessary due to stormwater contamination being identified through visual assessment of substantially similar outfall. Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section D Page 122 3. Monitoring Periods (a) Sampling, inspections, and examinations that are required on a quarterly basis must be conducted during the following periods: First (1st) quarter : January 1 thru March 31; Second (2nd) quarter : April 1 thru June 30; Third (3rd) quarte r: July 1 thru September 30; and Fourth (4th) quarter : October 1 thru December 31. Permittees shall begin required sampling, inspections, and examinations on a quarterly basis in the first full quarter following submission of a n NOI. (b) Sampling, inspections, and examinations that are required on a semiannual basis must be conducted during the following periods: First (1st) period : January 1 thru June 30; and Second (2nd) period : July 1 thru December 31. Permittees shall begin required sampling, inspection s, and examinations on a semiannual basis in the first full period following submission of a n NOI. (c) Monitoring, inspections, and examinations that are required on an annual basis must be conducted before December 31st of each calendar year, beginning with t he calendar year that includes the first full quarter following submittal of an NOI. 4. Exceptions to Monitoring Requirements (a) Adverse Conditions. (1) Requirements to sample, inspect, examine or otherwise monitor stormwater discharges within a prescribed monitoring period may be temporarily suspended for adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are conditions that are either dangerous to personnel (e.g., h igh wind, excessive lightning) or conditions that prohibit access to a discharge (e.g., flooding, freezing conditions, extended periods of drought). Adverse conditions that result in the temporary suspension of a permit requirement to sample, inspect, exam ine, or otherwise monitor stormwater discharges must be documented and included as part of the SWP3. Documentation must include : a. the date and time of the adverse condition, b. names of personnel that witnessed the adverse condition, c. a narrative for the nature of the adverse condition , and d. readings of the on -site rain gauge , representative weather station, or subject to TCEQ's approval, the alternative means of compliance . (2) Monitoring Waivers. When monitoring is temporarily suspended du e to adverse conditions, that monitoring must be conducted at the next representative rain event or in the next monitoring period , whichever comes first, in addition to any monitoring required for that period. If the temporarily suspended monitoring requi rement cannot be fulfilled during the next monitoring period due to continued adverse conditions , then it is permanently waived for both monitoring periods . (3) The SWP3 must include records of why monitoring was temporarily suspended due to adverse conditions . Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section D Page 123 (b) Inactive Facilities. Permitted facilities in this inactive status must provide written notice to the executive director of this status by submitting an NOC . Following this notification, permit requirements to sample, inspect, examine, or otherwise monitor stormwater discharges are waived during the period that a facility maintains inactive status, unless the requirements in Part V. of this permit include specific requirements for inactive facilities. Inactive facilities must notify the executive director by submitting an NOC according to Part II.C.6 at least 48 hours before commencing industrial activities and transferring to active status. (c) Lack of Qualifying Storm Event. When monitoring was not possible due to a lack of a qualifying storm event as docume nted in the rain gauge recording, representative weather station, or subject to TCEQ's approval, the alternative means of compliance, monitoring is temporarily suspended. 5. Records Retention Monitoring and reporting records, copies of all other records required by this general permit, and records of all data used to complete the application for this general permit must be retained at the facility or must be mad e readily available for review upon request by authorized TCEQ personnel as well as any local pollution control agency with jurisdiction for a period of three (3) years from the date of the record or sample, measurement, report, application, or certification. This period must be extended at the request of the executive director. The SWP3 must be maintained and be made readily available for inspection and review upon request by authorized TCEQ personnel as well as any local pollution control agency with jurisdiction . Additionally, a copy of all SWP3s for the preceding three (3) year period must be maintained and made readily available for re view. In circumstances where the number of revisions to the SWP3 makes this requirement burdensome, a log or record of revisions for the preceding three (3) year period may be maintained and made available. If the general permit is terminated or allowed to expire without renewal, the SWP3 must be maintained and made readily available for review for a minimum period of one (1) year following cessation of permit coverage. 6. Monitoring and Inspection Documentation The procedures for conducting the required analy tical monitoring must be documented in the SWP3. (a) For each type of monitoring required in the permit, the SWP3 must include the following: (1) a list of locations where samples are collected, including any determination that two (2) or more stormwater only outfalls are considered to be substantially similar; (2) parameters that must be sampled, including the frequency of sampling for each parameter; (3) schedules for conducting monitoring activities; (4) any numeric control values applicable to discharges from each outfall (e.g., benchmark sampling levels, numeric effluent limitations, or other requirements); and (5) procedures for gathering storm event data. Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section E Page 124 (b) If the permittee is not conducting monitoring due to claiming an inactive and unstaffed site, the information to support this claim must be included in the SWP3. (c) The procedures for performing the inspections specified by this permit must be documented in the SWP3, including routine facility inspections, quarterly visual assessment of stormwater discharges, and comprehensive site inspections. For each type of inspection performed, the SWP3 must identify the person(s) or positions of person(s) responsible for inspection; schedules for conducting inspections, including tentative schedule for facilities in climates with irregular stormwater runoff discharges; and specific items to be covered by the inspection, including schedules for specific outfalls. Section E. Stand ard Permit Conditions 30 TAC Chapter 305 requires certain regulations appear as standard conditions in waste discharge permits. 30 TAC \u00a7\u00a7305.121 - 305.129, Subchapter F, Permit Characteristics and Conditions, as promulgated under the TWC \u00a7\u00a75.103 and 5.105, the Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7361.017 and 361.024(a), and those sections of 40 CFR Part 122 adopted by reference by the Commission, establish the characteristics and standards for waste discharge permits. This section includes these conditions and incorporates them into this general permit. More specific requirements for some of these standard permit conditions may be defined for specific sectors of industrial activity that are authorized to discharge under this general permit. 1. General Conditions (a) Duty to Comply. (1) Submission of an NOI for permit coverage is an acknowledgment that the applicant agrees to comply with the conditions of the general permit. Acceptance of authorization under the provisions of this general permit constitutes acknowledgment and agreement that the permittee will comply with all the terms and conditions embodied in the permit, and the rules and other orders of the Commission. (2) The permittee has a duty to comply with all conditions of the permit. Failure to comply with any permit con dition constitutes a violation of the permit and the Texas Water Code or the Texas Health and Safety Code and is grounds for enforcement action, for revocation or suspension of coverage under this general permit, and for requiring a permittee to apply for a TPDES individual permit or coverage under an alternative general permit. (b) Toxic Pollutants. (1) If any toxic effluent standard or prohibition is promulgated according to the TWC \u00a726.023 for a toxic pollutant that is present in the discharge and that standard or prohibition is more stringent than the conditions of this general permit, this general permit must be modified or revoked and reissued to conform to the toxic effluent standard or prohibition. (2) The permittee shall comply with effluent standards or prohib itions established according to the TWC \u00a726.023 for toxic pollutants within the time provided in the regulations that established those standards or prohibitions, even if this general permit has not yet been modified to incorporate the requirement. Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section E Page 125 (c) Permit Flexibility. Authorization under this general permit may be modifie d, suspended or revoked for cause according to 30 TAC \u00a7\u00a7305.62 and 305.66 and the TWC Section \u00a77.302. The filing of a notice of planned changes or anticipated non- compliance does not stay any permit condition. (d) Property Rights. A permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any exclusive privilege. (e) Duty to Provide Information. The permittee shall furnish to the executive director, upon request, any information, including records that are maintained as a requirement of this permit, necessary to determine whether cause exists for revoking, suspending, or terminating authorization under this general permit.

Nothing in this permit shall be construed to relieve the permittee from civil or criminal penalties for non -compliance . (2) Any false or materially misleading representatio n or concealment of information required to be reported by the provisions of the permit or applicable regulation, which avoids or effectively defeats the regulatory purpose of this general permit, may subject the permittee to criminal enforcement. (g) Severabi lity. The provisions of this general permit are severable and if any provision of this permit or the application of any provision of this permit to any circumstance is held invalid, the application of such provision to other circumstances, and the remainde r of this general permit, shall not be affected thereby. 2. Proper Operation and Maintenance (a) Need to Halt or Reduce Not a Defense. It is not a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the cond itions of this general permit. (b) Duty to Mitigate. The permittee shall take all reasonable steps to minimize or prevent any discharge or other permit violation that has a reasonable likelihood of adversely affecting human health or the environment. (c) Operation of Treatment and Control Systems. (1) The permittee shall at all times ensure that the facility and all of its systems of collection, treatment, and disposal are properly operated and maintained in a manner that will minimize discharges of excessive pollutants and will achieve compliance with the conditions of this permit. Proper operation and maintenance also include adequate laboratory controls and appropriate quality assurance procedures. This pr ovision requires the operation of backup or auxiliary systems that are installed by a permittee only when the operation is necessary to achieve compliance with the conditions of this permit. Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section E Page 126 (2) The permittee shall provide an adequate operating staff that is d uly qualified to carry out operation, maintenance, and testing functions required to ensure compliance with the conditions of this general permit. (d) Anticipated Non -compliance . The permittee shall give advance notice to the executive director of any planned changes in the permitted facility or activity that may result in non- compliance with permit requirements. 3. Inspection and Entry Requirements (a) Inspection and Entry. Inspection and entry must be allowed as prescribed in the TWC Chapters 26, 27, and 28, and Texas Health and Safety Code Chapter 361. (b) Entry to Public or Private Property. The members of the C ommission and employees and agents of the Co mmission are entitled to enter any public or private property at any reasonable time for the purpose of inspecting and investigating conditions relating to the quality of surface water in the state or the compliance with any rule, regulation, permit or oth er order of the C ommission. Members, employees, or agents of the Commission and C ommission contractors are entitled to enter public or private property at any reasonable time to investigate or monitor or, if the responsible party is not responsive or there is an immediate danger to public health or the environment, to remove or remediate a condition related to the quality of surface water in the state. Members, employees, Commission contractors, or agents acting under this authority who enter private proper ty shall observe the establishment's rules and regulations concerning safety, internal security, and fire protection, and if the property has management in residence, shall notify management or the person then in charge of his presence and shall exhibit pr oper credentials. If any member, employee, C ommission contractor, or agent is refused the right to enter in or on public or private property under this authority, the executive director may invoke the remedies authorized in TWC \u00a77.002. 4. Monitoring and Sampl ing (a) Representative Sampling. Samples and measurements taken for the purpose of monitoring must be representative of the monitored activity or activities and must be taken at an outfall or outfalls that will best represent the types of industrial activity o r activities conducted at a facility site. If no obvious outfall location is present (e.g., a diffuse point source), the permittee may need to create a sampling point. This may include creating a depression or using physical means (e.g., sandbags or curb s) to direct the runoff for easier collection for sampling and measurement purposes. (b) Benchmark Monitoring. This type of monitoring differs from monitoring for compliance with numeric effluent limitations . Results from benchmark monitoring are used to determine if the selected BMPs are effective. The samples should be collected from internal or external outfalls where the BMPs are installed. (c) Monitoring Procedures. (1) Unless otherwise specified in this permit, test procedures for the analysis of pollutants sh all comply with p rocedures specified in 30 TAC \u00a7\u00a7 319.11 - 319.12. (2) All laboratory tests submitted to demonstrate compliance with this permit must meet the requirements of 30 TAC Chapter 25, Environmental Testing Laboratory Accreditation and Certification. Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part III, Section E Page 127 (d) Monitoring Results. Monitoring results must be provided at the intervals specified in this general permit. (e) Additional Monitoring by the Permittee. If the permittee monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by this general permit using approved analytical methods, all results of the monitoring must be included in the calculation and reporting of the values recorded on the DMR and must be included in any other calculation, record, or reports required to be maintained as a provision of this general permit. Increased frequency of sampling must be indicated on the DMR. 5. Records Requirements (a) Retention of Records. (1) The period records are required to be retained must be automatically extended to the date of the final disposition of any administrative or judicial enforcement action that may be instituted against the permittee. (2) Monitoring and reporting records, including records of calibration and maintenance, and copies of all records and reports required by this permit, must be retained at the facility or m ust be readily available for review by a TCEQ representative for a period of three years from the date of the record or sample, measurement, report, application or certification unless otherwise specified in this permit. This period must be extended at the request of the e xecutive director. (b) Record Contents. Records of monitoring must include, at a minimum, the following: (1) date, time, and place of sample or measurement; (2) identity of the individual who collected the sample, made the measurement or observation , or performed the analysis; (3) date and time the sample, measurement, or observation was made, and the analysis conducted; (4) identity of the individual and laboratory who performed the analysis; (5) technique or method of analysis; (6) results of the measurement, observation, or analysis; and (7) quality assurance/quality control records. 6. Reporting Requirements (a) Self-Reporting of Numeric Effluent Limits Results. (1) Results of analyses for determining compliance with numeric effluent limitations must be submitt ed online using the NetDMR reporting system available through the TCEQ website unless the permittee requests and obtains an electronic reporting waiver.

When the permittee becomes aware that it either submitted incorrect information or failed to submit any relevant facts on an NOI, NOT, NEC, NOC, or any repor t, it must promptly submit the facts or information to the executive director. 7. Solid Waste (a) Industrial Solid Waste Facilities that generate industrial solid waste as defined in 30 TAC \u00a7335.1 must comply with these provisions: (1) Any solid waste, as defined in 30 TAC \u00a7335.1, generated by the permittee during the management and treatment of stormwater , must be managed according to all applicable provisions of 30 TAC Chapter 335, relating to Industrial Solid Waste and Municipal Hazardous Waste. For the purpose of stormwater treatment, a solid waste management unit includes structural controls such as detention ponds, retention ponds, or other similar dedicated ponds used for removal of pollutants in stormwater, and does not include other control structures such as berms; grass swales; pipes and ditches (or similar stormwater conveyances); or silt fences. (2) Stormwater that is being collected, accumulated, stored, or processed within a solid waste management unit, before discharge through any final outfall authorized b y this permit, is considered to be solid waste until the stormwater passes through the actual point source discharge, and must be managed according to all applicable provisions of 30 TAC Chapter 335. (3) The permittee shall provide written notification, pursua nt to the requirements of 30 TAC \u00a7335.6, to the Corrective Action Section (MC -127) of the Remediation Division informing the Commission of any closure activity involving a Solid Waste Management Unit, at least 90 days prior to conducting such an activity. (4) Construction of any solid waste management unit requires the prior written notification of the proposed activity, pursuant to the requirements of 30 TAC \u00a7335.6(a) to the Registration and Reporting Section (MC 129) of the Permitting and Registration Support Division. No person shall dispose of industrial solid waste or municipal hazardous waste, including sludge or other solids from Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part IV, Section A Page 130 stormwater treatment processes, prior to fulfilling the deed recordation requirements of 30 TAC \u00a7335.5. (5) The permittee shall kee p management records for all sludge or other waste removed from any stormwater treatment process. These records must fulfill all applicable requirements of 30 TAC Chapter 335 and must include the following, as it pertains to wastewater treatment and discha rge: a. volume of waste and date generated from treatment process; b. volume of waste disposed of onsite or shipped off -site; c. date of disposal; d. identity of hauler or transporter; e. location of disposal site; and f. method of final disposal. The above records must be updated on a monthly basis. The records must be retained at the facility or must be readily available for review by authorized representatives of the TCEQ for at least five years. (b) Municipal Solid Waste All facilities regulated under this general permit that generate municipal solid waste must comply with applicable rules and regulations, including 30 TAC Chapter 330. Part IV. BENCHMARK MONITORING REQUIREMENTS This permit specifies pollutant benchmark concentrations that are applicable to certain industrial sectors/subsectors. Benchmark monitoring data are primarily used to determine the overall effectiveness of selected BMPs. Section A. Use of Benchmark Data 1. Monitoring for Benchmark Parameters in Discharges The permittee shall monitor the discharge(s) from regulated industrial activities as required in Part III.E.4(b) and Part V of this general permit, for the benchmark parameters specified within each section of Part V. Benchmark m onitoring is required for the industrial sector(s) listed in Part V of this pe rmit that are applicable to the permittee's facility/site. This includes the primary industrial activity and any co -located industrial activities (i.e., secondary industrial activities) that are conducted at the site and are described in this permit. (a) The permittee shall compare the results of the benchmark analyses to the benchmark values for any pollutant(s) that the permittee is required to monitor according to Part V of this general permit, and shall include this comparison in the overall assessment of the SWP3's effectiveness. Analytical results that exceed a benchmark value are not a violation of this permit, as these values are not numeric effluent limitations. However, not c onducting benchmark sampling, not submitting the benchmark monitoring form with sample results , or not submitting the benchmark monitoring form with an explanation as to why the sampling failed to be conducted is a violatio n of the permit requirements for benchmark monitoring submittal. Exceedances of be nchmark values indicate that modifications to the SWP3 and current BMP (s) may be necessary. Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part IV, Section A Page 131 (b) The permittee is not eligible for a sampling waiver under Part III, Section C. of this permit for any hazardous metals that are required to be sampled as part of benchmark monitoring. The permittee is subject to the effluent limitations in Part III, Sectio n C. for any monitoring for hazardous metals that is conducted at a final outfall. (c) Sampling, monitoring, and analyses must be conducted according to procedures specified in Part III, Section E .4. of this permit unless otherwise specified and using test p rocedures with minimum analytical levels (MALs) at or below benchmark values for all the benchmark parameters for which sampling is required. 2. Background Concentrations If during benchmark monitoring the average concentration of a pollutant exceeds a benchmark value and it is determined that the exceedance is attributable solely to the presence of that pollutant in the natural background, the permittee is not required to perform corrective action or additional benchmark monitoring provided that: (a) the average concentration of the benchmark monitoring results are less than or equal to the concentration of the pollutant in the natural background; (b) the permittee documents in t he SWP3 the supporting rationale for concluding that benchmark exceedance are attributable solely to natural background pollutant levels, as outlined in Part IV, Section A.2.of this permit. Any data previously collected (including literature studies) must be included in the supporting rationale that describe the levels of natural background pollutants in the stormwater discharge; and (c) the permittee notifies TCEQ in writing during the reporting period for the sampling period that the permittee determined the benchmark exceedance are attributable solely to natural background pollutant levels. Natural background pollutants include substances that are naturally occ urring in the soil or groundwater. Natural background pollutants do not include legacy pollut ants from earlier activity at the site, or pollutants in runon from neighboring sources that are not naturally occurring. Background concentrations may be identifi ed by laboratory analyses of samples of stormwater runon to the permitted facility, laboratory analyses of samples of stormwater runoff from adjacent non- industrial areas, or by identifying the pollutant as a naturally occurring material in soil at the sit e. 3. Investigations of Benchmark Value Exceedences The Pollution Prevention Team must investigate the cause for each exceedance and must document the results of this investigation in the SWP3 within 90 days following the sampling event. The Pollution Preven tion Team investigation must identify the following: (a) any additional potential sources of pollution, such as spills that might have occurred; (b) necessary revisions to the Good Housekeeping Measures section of the SWP3; (c) additional BMPs, including a schedule to install or implement the BMPs; and (d) other parts of the SWP3 for which revisions are appropriate. Background concentrations of specific pollutants may be considered during the investigation as described in Part IV, Section A.2. above. If the Pollution Prevention Team is able to relate the cause of the exceedance to background concentrations, then subsequent Multi Sector Gener al Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part IV, Section B Page 132 exceedance of benchmark values for that pollutant may be resolved by referencing the earlier finding in the SWP3. 4. Exception for Inactive and Unstaffed Sites The requirement for benchmark monitoring does not apply at a facility that is inactive and unstaffed, provided that there are no industrial materials or activities exposed to stormwater and that the permittee performs the following: (a) include a written statement in the SWP3 stating that the site is inactive and unstaffed, and that there are no industrial materials or activities exposed to stormwater . This statement must be signed and certified in accordance with 30 TAC \u00a7305.128; and (b) immediately begin complying with the applicable benchmark monitoring requirements in this section if circumstances change and industrial materials or activities become exposed to stormwater, or the facility becomes active or staffed, as this creates a condition where the exception no longer applies. Benchmark monitoring must be resumed as if in the first year of permit coverage. The permittee must indica te in the first benchmark monitoring report that the facility has materials or activities exposed to stormwater or has become active or staffed. (c) If a site or facility is not qualified for this exception at the time authorization is obtained under this per mit, but becomes qualified because the facility is inactive and unstaffed at some point during the permit term, and there are no industrial materials or activities that are exposed to stormwater, then the permittee must notify TCEQ in writing of this chang e in the next benchmark monitoring report. Benchmark monitoring may be discontinued once TCEQ has b een notified in writing, and a certification statement has been prepared and signed and certified in accordance with 30 TAC \u00a7305.128. 5. Adverse Weather Conditions Sampling under this section is subject to the exceptions related to adverse weather conditions or drought in accordance with Part III, Section D.4. of this general permit. Section B. Benchmark Monitoring Requirements The benchmark monitoring parameters for each industrial sector are listed in Part V of this general permit under the individual sectors. Benchmark monitoring must be conducted once every six mont hs for four (4) years following permit issuance. 1. Monitoring Periods (a) Benchmark m onitoring must be conducted once every six months (January through June or July through December) following permit issuance, and then once during each subsequent semiannual moni toring period (i.e., January through June and July through December) during the remaining permit term , except that a waiver is available for the third and fourth year according to Part IV, Section B.1.(c) below. (b) Operators of industrial facilities that obta in coverage after the beginning of a monitoring period shall initiate benchmark mo nitoring during the first six -month monitoring period (January through June or July through December). Because permit renewal occurs in between monitoring periods, the first year of sampling will occur on the first full six-month monitoring period (i.e. January through June) . Sampling must be conducted once per semiannual monitoring period (January through June and July Multi Sector Gener al Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part IV, Section B Page 133 through December) thereafter, for up to a total of four ( 4) years, or eight (8) semiannual monitoring periods , depending on when coverage is obtained . Monitoring is not required in the calendar year of renewal of the general permit , because this year does not have two full six months monitoring periods. A waiver is available if the annual average results of monitoring during the first two (2) years are all below benchmark levels, in accordance with Part IV, Section B.1.(c) below. (c) Waiver from Benchmark Monitoring. I f the annual average results of benchmark sampling for the first two monitoring years are all below the benchmark levels, the permittee may waive out of benchmark monitoring requirements during the third and fourth monitoring years. To request the waiver f rom benchmark monitoring, t he permittee shall submit an NOC in accordance with Part II.C.6. The annual average result is the average of all samples collected for a particular pollutant for a specific SIC code during the previous calendar year, January thro ugh December. If sampling for any monitoring period was not performed, then the average annual result must be calculated using the remaining samples for that calendar year. Permittees who obtain a waiver are subject to the following limitations: (1) The perm ittee may exercise this waiver from benchmark monitoring, so long as the analytical result for any pollutant limited in the annual hazardous metal monitoring does not exceed the corresponding benchmark monitoring level for that pollutant, if that pollutant is included in the list of parameters in Part V of this permit for which monitoring is required of the permittee. (2) If during monitoring for annual hazardous metals, sampling to comply with sector - specific effluent specific limits, or any additional sampling performed by the facility operator, an analytical result exceeds the benchmark level for a pollutant for which a benchmark waiver was obtained, the permittee shall investigate the source of the exceedance, make the necessary correction or mitigation (as outlined above in section A) and return to performing benchmark monitoring according to: the requirements of Part IV; the applicable schedule outlined in Part III, Section D.3.; and any sector specific requirements that apply. (3) This waiver does not affect the requirements for a permittee to sample and analyze its discharge to comply with any numeric effluent limitations established in this permit. (See Part III, Section C, related to hazardous metals monitoring, an d Part V for discharges subject to federal effluent limitations guidelines listed in Part V of this permit. 2. Reporting Requirements (a) Results of analyses for sampling during benchmark monitoring years one through four, must be submitted to TCEQ before March 3 1 of each year following sample collection. Permittees who requested a benchmark waiver after the first two monitoring years, following the NOI submittal, are not required to submit sampling results for monitoring years three and four. The reported values must be the average yearly result of analysis for each specific pollutant discharged under a specific SIC code, rather than an outfall -by-outfall, basis. The results must be submitted online using the NetDMR reporting system unless the permittee requests and obtains an electronic reporting waiver. Permittees that request and obtain an electronic reporting waiver shall submit a monitoring results on a form (TCEQ No. 20091) provided by the executive director and mailed to the TCEQ's Stormwater Team (MC -148). Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part V, Sector A Page 134 (b) Substantially similar outfalls may be established for benchmark monitoring, in accordance with Part III, Section D.2. of this general p ermit. (c) If sampling during any six -month period is not conducted for a pollutant due to adverse weather conditions or d rought in accordance with Part III, Section D.4. of this general permit, then the reported average annual result must be based on data collected for that year. If there is no rain during a given week, the permittee shall monitor and record a zero rainfall total or no rain for the wee k according to Part III.D.1.(c). Part V.

Definitions The following definitions apply only to Section G of this general permit: Active metal mining facility. A place where work or other activity related to the extraction, removal, or recovery of metal ore is being conducted. For surface mines, this definition does not include any land where grading has returned the earth to a desired contour and reclamation has begun. This definition is derived from the definition of \"active mining area\" found at 40 CFR \u00a7440.132(a). Active phase . Activities including the extraction, removal or recovery of metal ore. For surface mines, this definition does not include any land w here grading has returned the earth to a desired contour and reclamation has begun. This definition is derived from the definition of \"active mining area\" found at 40 CFR \u00a7440.132(a). The active phase is considered part of \"mining operations.\" Exploration phase. Entails exploration and land disturbance activities to determine the viability of a site. The exploration phase is not considered part of \"mining operations.\" Final Stabilization. All soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and a uniform (e.g. evenly distributed, without large bare areas) perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70% of the native background vegetative cover for the area has been established on all unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent structures, or equivalent permanent stabilization measures (such as the use of riprap, gabions, or geotextiles) have been employed. Alternatively, for arid, semi -arid, and drought stricken areas only, final stabilization means that all soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and both of the following criteria have been met: temporary erosion control measures are selected, designed, and installed along with an appropriate seed base to provide erosion control for at least three years without active maintenance by the operator; and the temporary erosion control measures are selected, designed, and installed to achieve 70% vegetative coverage within three years. Inactive metal mining facility. A site or portion of a site with an identifiable operator, where metal mining or milling occurred in the past but is not an active facility as defined above, where the inactive portion is not covered by an active mining permit, and where the reclamation phase has not been completed. Mining operations. Consists of the active mining, inactive mining, temporarily inactive mining, and reclamation phases, but excludes the exploration and construction phases. Reclamation phase. Activities undertaken to return the land to an appropriate post- mining land use prior to termination of permit coverage. Temporarily inactive metal mining facility. A site or portion of a site where metal mining or milling occurred in the past and is no t currently being actively undertaken, and where the facility is covered by an active mining permit. 4. Limitations on Permit Coverage (a) Prohibition on Certain Stormwater Discharges. Discharges from active metal mining facilities that are subject to effluent li mitation guidelines for the Ore Mining and Dressing Point Source Category (40 CFR Part 440) are not authorized under this general permit. Stormwater from active metal mining facilities is only subject to 40 CFR Part 440 (and therefore not eligible for cove rage under this permit) if it commingles with other discharges that are subject to 40 CFR Part 440. Discharges from overburden/waste Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part V, Sector G Page 150 rock and overburden/waste rock -related areas are not subject to 40 CFR Part 440 unless they: (1) drain naturally (or are intent ionally diverted) to a point source; and (2) combine with ''mine drainage'' that is otherwise regulated under the 40 CFR Part 440. Such sources may obtain coverage under this general permit if the discharge is composed entirely of stormwater, does not commingl e with other sources of mine drainage that are not subject to 40 CFR Part 440, and meets the other eligibility criteria contained in the general permit. (b) Prohibition on Non -Stormwater Discharges. The following discharges are not authorized by this general p ermit: process generated wastewater, including but not limited to truck wash water, adit drainage (e.g., drainage from mine passageways or tunnels), contaminated springs, and seeps discharging from waste rock dumps that do not directly result from precipitation events from active, temporarily inactive, and inactive mines. (c) Authorization Not Required. Stormwater from sites where mining claims are being maintained prior to disturbances associated with the extraction, beneficiation, or processing of mined mater ials and sites where minimal activities are undertaken for the sole purpose of maintaining a mining claim are not considered either active or inactive mining facilities and do not require authorization. 5. Additional SWP3 Requirements In addition to the requi rements of Part III, Section A of this general permit, the following is required: (a) Inventory of Exposed Materials. This section of the SWP3 must contain a summary of any existing ore, waste rock, and overburden characterization data. The summary must includ e results of all testing for acid rock generation potential. The inventory and the SWP3 must be updated if the characterization is updated due to a change in the type of ore mined. For inactive metal mining facilities, the inventory must identify any signi ficant materials that remain at the facility and include any available characterization data of the material. (b) Narrative Description. For inactive metal mining facilities, this section of the SWP3 must include a description of the mining and associated acti vities that took place at the site. The description must define the dates of operation, total acreage within the mine, total acreage within the processing area, an estimate of the acres of remaining disturbed area, and any current activities at the site ( e.g. reclamation). (c) Site Map. A topographic site map (or maps) must be developed to indicate mining or milling site boundaries; access and haul roads; equipment storage, fueling, and maintenance areas; an outline of the overburden, materials, soils, tailing s or wastes storage areas; points of discharge from the property of mine drainage or any other process wastewater, a depiction of the discharge route, and a listing of the type of wastewater; location of existing and proposed tailings piles and ponds; heap leach pads; locations of springs, streams, wetlands, and other surface waters; and boundaries of tributary areas that are subject to effluent limitations and guidelines for the Ore Mining and Dressing Point Source Category (40 CFR Part 440). (d) Management of Runoff with Structural Controls. The elimination of a contaminant source through capping of the source may be the most effective control measure. Multi Sector General Permit TPDES General Permit No. TXR050000 Part V, Sector G Page 151 Where capping is used, the source being capped must be identified and the materials and procedu res used to cap the source must be described within the SWP3. (e) Inactive and Unstaffed Sites. Subject to the following conditions, if the facility is inactive and unstaffed, the permittee is not required to conduct quarterly visual assessments and routine fa cility inspections. Waivers are not given for exception from conducting the comprehensive site inspection. Permittees are encouraged to inspect their site more frequently where there is reason to believe that severe weather or natural disasters may have da maged control measures or increased discharges. (1) If circumstances change and the facility becomes active or staffed, this exception no longer applies, and the permittee must immediately begin complying with the quarterly visual assessment requirements; and (2) The TCEQ retains the authority to revoke this exemption or the monitoring waiver where it is determined that the discharge causes, has a reasonable potential to cause, or contributes to an instream excursion above an applicable water quality standard, inc luding designated u ses. 6. Benchmark Monitoring Requirements (a) Active copper ore mining or dressing facilities must conduct benchmark monitoring according to the standard benchmark monitoring requirements in Part IV of this general permit and conduct evaluatio ns on the effectiveness of the facility SWP3 based on the following benchmark values: Table 14.
