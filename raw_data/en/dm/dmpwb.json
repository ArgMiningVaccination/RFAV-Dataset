RNAi mechanism is used by cells to regulate the expression of genes & replication of viruses. The undesirable production of certain proteins (gene expression) is a substantial factor in many human diseases. The abnormality may be due to defective gene, over or under production of a protein by a \"normal\" gene, or by the expression of genes from viruses or bacteria. This abnormal protein production may have direct effects on cells within the body or may initiate a series of events involving other proteins, thereby producing diseases. In this paper we have done phylogenetic analysis of miRNA among ten different viruses viz (Bandicoot Carcinomatosis Virus Type 1 and Type2, Bovine Bovine Leukemia Virus, Epstein Simian Virus 40) study shows that there is functional relationship between Epstein Barr Virus and Rehusus Lymphocryptovirus ,sharing 21 clades with a confidence bootstrap value from 80-100%. This shows that RLV infection in rhesus monkeys have a similarity with EBV infection in humans. Present study shows that there is a close relationship in regulatory mechanism of Rehusus lympho cryptovirus and Epstein Barr Virus. Hence Rehusus lympho cryptovirus can be used as a model system to study molecular mechanism of pathogenesis and new drug development process for Epstein Barr Virus.
