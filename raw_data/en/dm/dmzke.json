Introduction On December 13, 2016 the 21st Century Cures Act was signed into law (P.L. 114 -255). The law was intended to accelerate the process of discovery, development, and delivery of health care innovation. In compliance with Section 3093 of the 21st Century Cures Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) is required to prepare and submit, within one year of enactment, a report to Congress on encouraging vaccine innovation. The Secretary, \"in collaboration with appropriate agencies or offices within the Department of Health and Human Services, including the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, shall submit to the Committee on Health, Educ ation, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives, and post publicly on the Internet website of the Department of Health and Human Services, a report on ways to promote innovation in the devel opment of vaccines that minimize the burden of infectious disease.\"1 1 Encouraging Vaccine Innovation, \u00a7 3093 of the 21st Century Cures Act (Dec. 13, 2016). Retrieved from https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW -114publ255/pdf/PLAW -114publ255.pdf Specifically, the report \"shall review the current status of vaccine development and, as appropriate \u2014 A. Consider the optimal process to determine which vaccines would be beneficial to publi c health and how information on such vaccines is disseminated to key stakeholders; B. Examine and identify whether obstacles exist that inhibit the development of beneficial vaccines; and C. Make recommendations about how best to remove any obstacles identified under subparagraph (B) in order to promote and incentivize vaccine innovation and development.\" 1 Summary The U.S. vaccine enterprise is well established and has been successful at bringing innovative and new and improved vaccines to the market. However, t he vaccine enterprise is at a turning point as challenges to innovation have increased for remaining infectious disease targets. Currently, HHS leads concerted and targeted efforts to address many of these challenges, spur continued innovation, and improve public health. This report examines the current state of U.S. vaccine development and innovation, highlights existing challenges, and offers potential opportunities and levers that could foster innovation. II. Development of the Report On behalf of the HHS Secretary, the National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO), in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), coordinated the development of this report. NVPO, Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 4 in collaboration with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy and Evaluation (ASPE), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administra tion (FDA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), created an interagency Vaccine Innovation Steering Committee (VISC). The VISC examined the vaccine enterprise and the relative contributions of key stakeholders involved in the development, licensu re, and use of vaccines. The VISC explored issues facing key stakeholders in the current environment and opportunities for the U.S. government (USG), within its existing authorities, to address some of these challenges. Additionally, HHS convened a panel o f non -federal experts on June 27, 2017. The participants on the panel provided their individual views, not a group consensus, on these issues; they represented a wide range of stakeholder perspectives including science, medicine, public health, regulatory, vaccine safety, patient policy, consumer advocac y, and private sector industry. III. Background Vaccines have an inherent societal benefit. They protect individuals and communities against serious infectious diseases and dramatically reduce the burden associated with such infectious diseases including hospitalizations, deaths, and health care costs in the United States. With further innovation and continued development, new and improved vaccines may have an e ven greater benefit to society. The USG is one o f many key stakeholders involved in the U.S. vaccine enterprise, a network of industrial, government, academic, non -profit, and private partners engaged in infectious disease surveillance, basic and applied research, product development, regulatory evaluat ion and licensure, recommendations for introduction and use, and vaccine uptake. Table 1 provides a brief description of the components of the U.S. vaccine enterprise, which generally characterizes the lifecycle of a vaccine. The USG works with diverse partners to shepherd potential vaccine candidates through the staged development process. O nce a vaccine is licensed by FDA for use , many stakeholders \u2014 such as patients, providers, payers, and public health officials \u2014 become involved in the immunization delivery system. Pursuing the development of vaccines is a long, expensive , and high risk e ndeavor. It begins with initial product interest, informed by existing and available information on disease burden and technical feasibility. Once the decision to pursue vaccine development is made, at least a decade of investment is typically needed to ad vance potential candidates from basic and applied research to licensure, production, and delivery into the immunization delivery system. Numerous candidates are tested in pre -clinical and early stage clinical trials, but not all have the technical feasib ility and potential product interest to move forward through the pipeline (Figure 1). As candidates move forward through the various stages of clinical trials, time and resource investments increase significantly. Data from clinical studies serve as the ba sis for licensure ; it Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 5 can take several years for a sponsor [i.e., the company , organization, or individual that sponsors the investigational new drug application (IND) for the conduct of clinical trials or biologics license application (BLA) for licensure] to demonstrate that the vaccine candidate meets the necessary FDA standards for vaccine safety and effectiveness. As a vaccine candidate progresses toward licensure, further investments are needed to demonstrate the ability to make the vaccine candidate a t large scale and in the intended commercial production facility. Overall, the time and financial investments necessary to develop a single safe, effective, FDA -licensed vaccine are high. These costs are even greater when considering the high -risk environm ent for investment, where most vaccine candidates do not make it to FDA -licensure and the costs of failed products must also be absorbed. The riskiness of the decision to invest in vaccine development takes into account the generally smaller markets for va ccines , which are usually administered once . This is in contrast to therapeutic products, which may be given several times or for a long duration throughout a patient's lifetime. The success of currently licensed vaccines in the immunization delivery sys tem and the anticipated markets for potential new vaccines also contribute to the risk of development. Factors that decrease the cost or risk of development, such as USG policies or actions, may help foster innovation and development. IV. Scope of the Report This report focuses on the U.S. network of industry, non-profit, foundation, government and academic partners engaged in vaccine research and development (R&D). This network is responsible for developing the majority of new vaccines available worldwide since World War II, a reflection of the current network's success in innovation. Cooperation and collaboration among these major partners are necessary to advance vaccine candidates through the development pipeline. Industry plays a central role in this c ollaboration. The number of companies involved in the vaccine enterprise has evolved over the years with a significant decrease in the number of large manufacturers that produce vaccines. Currently, the vaccine industry is comprised of numerous small biote chnology companies and four large manufacturers: GlaxoSmithKline, Merck and Co., Inc., Pfizer, and Sanofi Pasteur. In addition to industry, organizations such as non -profits and foundations support efforts to decrease costs and accelerate the pace of vaccine R&D and optimization (e.g., Global Health Vaccine Center of Innovation , Hillemen Laboratories, Coali tion for Epid emic Preparedness Innovations). Academic partners play a key role in the generation of new ideas and technologies. Both large and smal l companies bridge academic research and commercial development by supporting basic laboratory research for vaccine candidates and by conducting Phase 1, 2, 3 , and 4 clinical trials. Phase 1 clinical trials evaluate early safety and immune responses to the vaccine candidate. Phase 2 clinical trials involve dose -ranging and more comprehensive safety and immunogenicity studies. Phase 3 clinical trials are pivotal and require large -scale studies of safety and effectiveness. Phase 4 clinical trials are conducte d post -licensure and may be performed to fulfill post -marketing requirements and to provid e additional assessments of less Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 6 common rare adver se events or information on the dura tion of vaccine -induced immunity . During Phase 1 and 2 studies, the vaccine manu facturing process is also developed and refined to ensure consistency and high -quality. Due to limitations in capacity and funding, small companies often stop development at Phase 2 and large companies shepherd promising vaccine candidates through the late r, costlier stages of clinical trials, licens ure, and commercial production. Vaccine development is also a global enterprise. Depending on the specific vaccine candidate in development, a manufacturer may seek licensure in multiple countries, and face vary ing regulatory requirements. Extensive resources are required to engage in a global market, which can be a key factor in deciding which vaccine candidates to support in development programs. Efforts to expand regulatory convergenc e across countries are ong oing. The success of the vaccine industry in bring ing new, FDA -licensed vaccines to the public is dependent on an environment shaped, in part, by government actions and policies. The USG has a general interest in supporting the development, licensure, and introduction and use of vaccines that protect the public against infectious disease threats. More broadly , the USG has an interest in innovation \u2014 bringing new ideas and technologies to fruition \u2014 that may further improve public health and address and/or prevent emerging infectious diseases. Innovation can occur across the vaccine development spectrum, including with manufacturing processes (e.g. , cell-based and recombinant influenza vaccines)2 and new delivery systems (e.g., a patch instead of a needle), as well as novel candidates and improvements to existing vaccines (e.g., use of new and improved platforms or adjuvants). 2 Two new alternatives to egg-based influenza vaccine manufacturin g - cell-based and recombinan t vaccines - are examples of new methods to produce influenza vaccines . Both FDA-licensed vaccines were funded by HHS through BARDA in support of alternatives to domestic and egg-independen t vaccine production capacity to respond to future pandemics. V. Current Status of Vaccine Development Currently, more than 120 vacc ine candidates are under development for the prevention of more than 40 infectious disease targets as reported on the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association of America ( PhRMA ) website (Table 2) .3 Additional sources that track vaccine develop ment programs are the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. government. The WHO Vaccine Pipeline Tracker lists vaccine candidates currently under clinical development.4 The USG's ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest U.S. clinical trials database. While not an exhaustive list , these sources represent the vast majority of active development programs. 3 Table 2 lists only vaccines fo r infectious diseases; however, the full repo rt (Medicines for Vaccines in Developmen t 2017 Update) is broade r and includes cancer therapeutic drugs. 4 World Health Organization. WHO vaccine pipeline tracker. Retrieved from http://www.who.int/immunization/research/vaccine_pipeline_tracker_spreadsheet/en/ Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 7 Vaccine development is at a turning point for three primary reasons: (1) the prevailing business model prioritizes vaccine candidates with large markets, y et market sizes are likely smaller for many remaining targets which focus on subsets of the population; (2) substantial investment is needed to address the scientific complexity of remaining targets, which may also require further investment in novel appro aches to demonstrate safety and effectiveiness; and (3) uncertainty of the public health priority and demand for some targets may be unclear, which increases the uncertainty of the potential return on investment (ROI) and , therefore , investment risk of development. Some vaccines currently under development are expected to receive a recommendation for administration to a subset of the population rather than a universal recommendation for a broad cohort o f individuals . For example, vaccines that most benefit subpopulations - such as pregnant women or persons undergoing elective surgery - may only receive recommendations for use among those populations. This presents several challenges, especially for small companies. The market for these products may be smalle r and more difficult to estimate because of uncertainty about the population for whom the vaccine might be recommended and the expected level of utilizatio n. Additionally, new vaccine target s are more scientifically complex and challenging. The challenges presented may require substantial investment in new tools, standards, analysis methods, and other novel approaches to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Public health priorities have historically been evident to stakeholders due to the clear disease burden of many infectious agents (e.g., measles, polio) and the public health demand for vaccines. The development of certain vaccines \u2014 for example, universal influenza vaccines and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines for infants \u2014 is considered a hig h priority as reflected in the number of companies working on these vaccine targets. However, the public health priority for some vaccine targets is less clear. In order to support an enabling environment for continued innovation the following factors are important: having a shared understanding of market size; making investments in science and development programs; and knowing which vaccines are public health priorities within the vaccine enterprise. Small and Large Companies While the USG provides the maj ority of support for basic and applied research in the academic setting, most vaccine candidates are developed by small companies that drive innovation in early stage development. Many of these companies rely on funding from multiple sources including USG and venture capital, until late stage development when products with a potential ROI attract large companies for investment. The handful of large companies with the resources and expertise to support manufacturing, licensure, and commercial production may face vaccine development constrain ts in several ways. First, there are only a few companies to potentially shepard a vaccine through to licensure. Second, vaccine manufacturers are generally part of large pharmaceutical parent companies. Therefore, vaccin es often compete with other pharmaceutical products \u2014 that can Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 8 have a higher ROI and lower risks \u2014 for limited development resources. Third, vaccine manufacturers typically have capacity constraints , in that manufacturers plan for the global market . This requires navigating multiple regulatory authorities and immunization policies, which may vary from country to country. Reaching regulatory convergence across countries is a continued opportunity to improve efficient use of limited resources. Often, only pr oducts anticipated to have a global market provide sufficient incentive for large and risky investments. Investments in emerging priorities may also have opportunity costs. For example, supporting development of an Ebola virus vaccine (with an uncertain market) may require a company to shift resources from other development programs. Essentially , R&D investment in new or improved vaccines depends on projected costs and ROI. Role of Federal Agencies HHS has a far -reaching mission to protect and promote public health and respond to urgent and emerging disease threats. Within HHS, the major federal agencies and offices in the vaccine enterprise working on vaccine development include: NIH, FDA, CDC, BARDA (within ASPR) , and NVPO. Outside of HHS, the Departm ent of Defense (DoD) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) also make inves tments in vaccine development. Federal agencies and offices work in tandem with a broad range of stakeholders to optimize vaccine development. For example, HHS pl ays a key role in ensuring timely development and production of well -matched seasonal influenza vaccines, and is leading and coordinating efforts to improve these vaccines. Because i nfluenza viruses are constantly changing, seasonal influenza vaccines must be updated annually in order to match the vaccine with currently circulating virus strains. The yearly influenza vaccine strain selection, vaccine production, and licensure is a highly coordinated process that is based on global influenza data collected f rom health partners around the world, particularly the World Health Organization. For more than 10 years, the Pandemic and Seasonal Influenza Risk Management Meeting has served as a senior -level forum for decision -makers from stakeholder agencies. Leadersh ip from BARDA, CDC, FDA, NIH, NVPO , and others regularly meet to identify and address risk management issues related to the development, acquisition, deployment, and utilization of medical and public health countermeasures for pan demic and seasonal influen za. Additionally, HHS agencies and offices actively partner with the scientific community through workshops or other means to determine how to close the gap between vaccine discovery and delivery. The role of HHS agencies and offices is described below. National Institutes of Health (NIH) NIH supports and conducts basic and applied research, translational research, and clinical evaluation focused on identifying vaccine targets and advancing novel candidates through the vaccine development pipeline for a bro ad array of infectious diseases. NIH works closely and collaboratively with partners in academia, industry, and other federal agencies to facilitate vaccine innovation and development. It also supports the training of research investigators and fosters com munication of medical and health sciences information. In addition, NIH directly Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 9 supports vaccine development through its intramural program. For example, the NIH Vaccine Research Center (VRC), is dedicated to improving global human health through the rigo rous pursuit of effective vaccines, and is developing and evaluating vaccines for HIV/AIDS, influenza, Zika, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus, among other diseases. NIH collaborates with multiple partners to facilitate the development of vaccine platform te chnologies that will enhance the USG's ability to respond to emerging disease threats and accelerate vaccine development during public health emergencies. Basic research: An initial critical component for vaccine development is the advancement of basic research aimed at understanding how pathogens cause disease and, in turn, how the immune system responds to infection. NIH supports basic research on more than 300 pathogens to elucidate pathogen biology; examine interactions among pathogens, hosts, and th e environment; and determine the ways that microbes survive and multiply. Historically, NIH researchers have laid the groundwork for development of numerous vaccines by developing reliable animal models, identifying and characterizing multiple vaccine targ ets, defining the mode of transmission for such targets, and identifying critical components that trigger an immune response. In addition , NIH supports programs to more fully understand the mechanisms involved in the immune responses to infection and vacci nation, such as the Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC). HIPC is a large, collaborative research effort that focuses on studying vaccine responses of well -characterized human cohorts to better understand the immune system, its regulation, and the di fferences between immune systems that do and do not respond to vaccination. Data from this effort will be used to develop and evaluate new vaccines and immunization strategies that work in a greater diversity of individuals and help identify those potentia lly at risk for an adverse event. Translational research: Advances in basic research lead to targets and strategies for the development of new and improved vaccines. NIH supports translational research to turn concepts into products and provides services t o researchers to facilitate vaccine development. The NIH Partnerships Program for Translational Research is a long - standing initiative that encourages new research collaborations among experts from different disciplines of academia and industry and ensures that basic research findings and technologies are translated into new product development approaches. Recent Partnerships initiatives have focused on structure -based design of novel immunogens for vaccine development and the development of vaccines target ing antimicrobial - resistant bacteria. In addition, NIH offers comprehensive pre -clinical services to industry partners and academic researchers that seek to fill the gap between discoveries made at the basic research stage and the development of clinical p roducts, including evaluation of vaccine candidates, assay development, safety and toxicity testing, product optimization, and pilot lot manufacturing. Modern vaccines often require the addition of adjuvants , which are molecules that trigger the initial ac tivation of the immune system. NIH a djuvant discovery and development efforts are critical to the develop ment of new and improved vaccines against infectious diseases. NIH conducts pre -clinical evaluation of novel adjuvants in combination with infectious d isease vaccine candidates. Together, Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 10 these programs provide a tool box for vaccine developers looking to produce novel vaccines, such as vaccines with increased efficacy or va ccines for specific age groups. Clinical evaluation: To help turn basic research and translational discoveries into products that impact public health, NIH has made a significant investment in establishing state -of-the-art clinical trial networks for vaccine development and evaluation. This includes early clinical trials of novel vacci ne candidates to evaluate safety and immunogenicity, efficacy trials, and post-licensure studies of vaccines that can help inform clinical practice. One of the key programs NIH utilizes to evaluate promising vaccine candidates is the Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEUs), a network of sites that provides a ready resource for conducting clinical trials. NIH frequently serves as the Investigational New Drug Application ( IND) sponsor for vaccine candidates, and interacts with the FDA throughout the en tire product lifecycle, to ensure that all regulatory requirements are being met, and that the vaccine candidate is on the right path for licensure. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) FDA has a central role in vaccine development, as it is the federal agen cy charged with ensuring that vaccines undergo a rigorous and extensive development program to determine and ensure the safety, purity, and potency of these products . After a vaccine is FDA -licensed, FDA continues to monitor its safety, purity, and potency . Vaccine development programs include studies conducted by manufacturers according to FDA standards to evaluate safety and effectiveness in the target population. Clinical trials are conducted according to plans that reflect FDA's expertise in clinical tr ial design. FDA guides development of vaccines from pre -Phase 1 through Phase 4. Through meetings between medical and scientific experts from the FDA and the manufacturer, often early in the development of a vaccine candidate, and at critical later times, the sponsor (i.e., the company , organization, or individual that sponsors the IND for the conduct of clinical trials) gains valuable advice about planned clinical trials, development milestones, and data requirements. Vaccine review and licensing: Thanks to staffing increases that are supported by industry user fees, FDA has been able to further optimize its vaccine review and licensing process to encourage the development of new vaccines and make vaccines available for use sooner, without lowering FDA's standard for safety and effectiveness. This is achieved by implementing available innovative, flexible regulatory mechanisms and pathways. Expedited development pathways (e.g., Fast Track Designation, Priority Review, Accelerated Approval) and innova tive regulatory mechanisms (e.g., use of the animal rule and adaptive trial designs) applicable to vaccine candidates are outlined in Tables 3 -4. FDA has worked effectively to implement these flexible regulatory pathways and review practices. This flexibil ity has translated into a high proportion of vaccine approvals on the first regulatory review cycle, thereby increasing predictability for vaccine developers. Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 11 Regulatory science and innovation: Research is fundamental to FDA's ability to provide effective scientific and regulatory evaluation of vaccine candidates. FDA conducts its research activities in conjunction with its regulatory activities, which provides the agency a unique perspective on both fronts. A wide variety of rapidly evolving technical and scientific issues concerning the safety and effectiveness of vaccine candidates requires knowledge of new developments in basic research in the relevant biological disciplines. For this reason, FDA scientists conduct research in a variety of areas includin g evaluating new techniques and tools for regulatory testing of product safety and effectiveness, as well as developing strategies for new product development. International collaboration: The development, manufactur ing, clinical evaluation, and regulatory review of vaccine candidates are a global enterprise. FDA continually engages with its international regulatory counterparts to work toward harmonizing scientific standards and approaches for developing vaccine candidates, evaluating their safety and effe ctiveness, and overseeing their manufactur ing and quality. For example, FDA has been a Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center for Biological Standardization since 1998. As such, FDA is a key partici pant to develop and revise specific recommendations for the production and quality control of vaccine candidates of major international public health importance. In the hope that more vaccine candidates can be licensed and available to multiple regions of the world, FDA also works with the WHO, other National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), and with industry to encourage international convergence, more efficient product development, and development of the scientific and regulatory standards for safety and ef fectiveness that will help achieve these goals. Post -licensure manufacturing and safety monitoring: FDA continues to intensively oversee vaccine production after the vaccine candidate and its manufacturing processes are approved, to ensure continued safety and effectiveness. Furthermore, FDA may also require , at or after the time of approval, manufacturers to conduct additional post-market studies to evaluate known or potential serious risks. FDA evaluates safety signals that may arise, and takes appropriat e steps as needed, such as communicating vaccine safety information to the public and health care providers or requiring manufacturers to change the prescribing information (i.e., vaccine labeling ). FDA monitors the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS), a nationwide, joint effort with the CDC to conduct post -marketing passive surveillance and collect information about adverse events reported to occur after the administration of licensed vaccines. In addition to VAERS, the Sentinel Initiative is FD A's national electronic surveillance system for the post -market safety monitoring of medical products. The Sentinel System was implemented as an Active Post -Market Risk Identification and Analysis program in response to section 905 of the Food and Drug Adm inistration Amendments Act of 2007. The Post -Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring (PRISM) System, the vaccine safety portion of the Sentinel system, was initiated in 2009 as one of several national vaccine safety surveillance systems deployed dur ing the Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 12 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The PRISM database covers more than 190 million individuals in several data partner organizations. PRISM, which has capabilities for broad -based signal detection as well as for evaluating safety signals that may be identifi ed, is used by FDA to evaluate vaccine safety in the post -licensure setting. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) CDC leads the U.S. immunization program, which defin es disease burden and implement s and evaluat es national immunization policies and programs. CDC identifies, controls, and prevents infectious diseases through public health surveillance, epidemiologic studies, vaccine use recommendations, vaccine purchasing and service delivery, health communications, and post - marketing vaccine saf ety, vaccine effectiveness, and vaccine impact studies. CDC provides domestic and international leadership in laboratory technologies and techniques to detect and characterize vaccine -preventable and emerging diseases. CDC collaborates with both domestic and global partners to maximize the effectiveness of immunization policies and programs. Disease surveillance: In the United States, laws and regulations mandate reporting cases of specified infectious and non -infectious conditions to local, state, and terr itorial health departments. Health departments work with health care providers, laboratories, hospitals, and other partners to obtain the information needed to monitor, control, and prevent the occurrence and spread of these health conditions. Health depar tments notify CDC about the occurrence of certain conditions, and CDC receives, secures, processes, and disseminates nationally notifiable infectious diseases data. Through networks of state health departments, academic institutions, and other collaborator s, CDC is able to address important issues in infectious diseases and identify new problems as they arise. Infectious disease detection and response: It is critical to detect emergent, new diseases through domestic and international surveillance programs t hat characterize and track these diseases and identify potential targets for vaccine development. Through epidemiologic studies, diseases patterns are described and at-risk populations are identified. Etiologic agents are isolated and characterized in CDC laboratories, often in collaboration with networks of scientists across the United States and internationally. CDC laboratories may develop vaccine candidates for emerging diseases. Before a vaccine is FDA -licensed, CDC subject matter experts have met with pharmaceutical companies to share insights into the epidemiology and possible effectiveness of vaccines in development. CDC also conducts modeling and analysis to predict the potential impact of vaccines and economic analyses to establish the value propos ition of vaccines . National immunization policy: Once a vaccine is licensed by FDA, CDC sets the U.S. child and adult immunization schedules based on recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is a federal advisory c ommittee that provides advice to the CDC Director regarding the most appropriate use of licensed vaccines and related agents for control of vaccine -preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United States. In setting immunization schedules, CDC establishes the Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 13 standards of medical practice for immunization for the nation. In addition to inviting input from ACIP, CDC works with nongovernmental professional organizations or other public health service advisory committees. CDC and ACIP work with professional organizations including the Ameri can Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) to harmonize the pediatric immunization schedule, and with the American College of Physicians (ACP) , AAFP, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to harmonize t he adult immunization schedule. Unique to ACIP is its role in determining the vaccines included in the Vaccines for Children ( VFC) program . Nongrandfathered p rivate he alth plans, health plans offered through state and federal health insurance exchanges , and Medicaid expansion programs are required to provide first dollar coverage ( i.e., with no cost-sharing to the patient ) for the vaccines included in the CDC immunizati on schedules. CDC immunization recommendations provide an estimated potential market size for the vaccine manufacturer. National immunization program : CDC supports the nation's public health infrastructure, which includes public health experts and systems critical to the success of our nation's immunization program. This public health infrastructure promotes immunization recommendations across the lifespan; fosters convenient access to recommended vaccinations; provides a safety net for those who cannot ot herwise access immunization services; manages vaccine shortages; monitors the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and vaccine policies; prevents disease outbreaks and responds early and rapidly should they occur; and prepares to respond quickly and compre hensively to other urgent vaccine e mergencies, such as pandemics. In collaboration with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) , CDC implements the federal VFC program . Through this program, CDC provides vaccines at no cost to eligible children from birth through 18 years of age. Through its federal contracts and centralized distribution system, CDC purchases and distributes vaccines to a network of more than 44,000 enrolled provider sites each year. The nationwide VFC program is responsible for vaccinating more than half of U.S. children annually . CDC also provides vaccines to 64 immunization program awardees for vaccinating uninsured, poor adults , and for use in outbreak response s. CDC conducts communications research and develops evidence -based tools, training, and resources about immunization for the public and health care providers. CDC's health communications work is focused on describing the benefits of vaccines and risks of vaccine -preventable diseases, and responding to frequently asked qu estions about vaccines. CDC also implements a robust provider education program on topics ranging from how to make a recommendation to answering questions about vaccine safety. Through the National Immunization Survey, the National Health Information Surve y, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, CDC measures childhood, adolescent, and adult immunization coverage. CDC uses these data to inform program decisions and to reduce disparities in immunization coverage. Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 14 Post -marketing vaccine safety an d effectiveness: Following introduction of a new or improved vaccine recommendation, CDC and FDA collaborate on conduct ing studies to monitor the impact of the vaccine in the community setting. This work includes monitoring vaccine safety through VAERS in collaboration with FDA, and conducting vaccine safety studies through the Vaccines Safety Datalink (VSD) network and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) network. CDC also conducts post -marketing studies to evaluate the effectiveness of vacci nes. These studies help characterize the performance of vaccines when used routinely among the recommended population. The findings from these studies are used by vaccine manufacturers and FDA in making decisions to revise the license ; and by ACIP and CDC in making decisions on recommendations for the use of vaccines, such as number of doses, time intervals, and recommended populations. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response BARDA's mission is to develop and procure needed medical countermeasures (MCMs) including vaccines against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents; emerging infectious diseases; and pandemic influenza, wheth er natural or intentional in origin. BARDA funding bridges the \"valley of death,\" the critical juncture between R&D and late stages of product development where funding requirements significantly increase and many development programs are forced to stop du e to lack of funding. BARDA provides non -dilutive funds for the late stage development of new product technologies toward approval, clearance, or licensure of MCMs. Many such MCMs lack meaningful commercial markets and , without USG support , would be unlik ely candidates for development. BARDA fulfills its mission by supporting advanced R&D of needed MCMs; working in collaboration with manufacturers, NIH, CDC, FDA, DoD, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); supporting technology innovation through st rategic initiatives; and managing acquisitions for stockpiling. Although originally envisioned as a preparedness organization, BARDA is also responsible for developing capabilities to respond to novel and emerging threats such as the recent MERS, Ebola, an d Zika outbreaks. The research, development, procurement, stockpiling, and deployment of MCMs needed to protect the public in the event of a public health emergency is the responsibility of multiple departments and agencies in the USG, which constitute the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE). The PHEMCE is an interagency coordinating body led by the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. It includes interagency partners from CDC, FDA, NIH, DoD, DHS, Veterans A ffairs (VA), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) . It coordinates the development, acquisition, stockpiling, and recommendations for use of medical products needed to effectively respond to a variety of high -consequence public health emergencies, whether naturally occurring or intentional. BARDA achieves its mission by establishing public -private partnerships through several approaches: Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 15 Direct advanced research and development support: BARDA maintains contracts with commercial parties to carry out a comprehensive set of tasks that comprise the technical, regulatory, clinical, and manufacturing components of MCM development. While the cost of these services is reimbursed by the USG, the FDA license and the right to sell the final product commercially belongs to the commercial partner. This approach has been successful with pandemic influenza vaccines and , thanks to USG support and BARDA and NIH efforts, it has led to the development of cell -based, recombinant, and adjuvanted seasonal influenza formula tions. Core services support: Through several networks, BARDA provides a variety of product development services (e.g., safety and efficacy studies in animal models, manufacturing filling and finishing services, clinical study support from designing clinic al protocols to managing clinical trial sites). Leveraging investments in technologies: BARDA supports platform technologies that streamline development and manufacture of MCMs against novel or emerging microbial pathogens. Investments in platform technologies may play a key role in refining or expediting vaccine development and manufacturin g in ways that make it more amenable for biodefense or public health programs. BARDA is implementing innovative public -private partnerships. Agreements under its \"Other Transaction Authority\"5 enable flexible advanced research and development funding to attract non-traditional government contractors and stimulate innovative vaccine development, overcoming contract ing constraints under the F ederal Acquisition Regulations. 5 Authority for Other Transactions was established by Pandemic an d All-Hazards P reparedness Act (PAHPA) of 2006. Additional information can be found here: http://www.phe.gov/about/amcg/otar/pages/default.aspxNational Vaccine Program Office (NVPO) Created in 1987 to provide leadership and coordination among federal and non -federal stakeholders on vaccine -related activities, NVPO works to ensure activities are carried out in an efficient, consistent, and timely manner. NVPO's efforts include: Strategic leadership and coordination : NVPO p repares and issues the National Vaccine Plan which establishes priorities across the vaccine system. This includes providing strategic direction for vaccine research, development, safety and efficacy testing, licensure, production and procurement, and the distribution and use of vaccines. It also involves evaluating the need for further effectiveness or adverse effect studies. The plan, which is developed in collaboration with federal and non -federal par tners, is designed to be reviewed and updated annually. Coordinating the National Vaccine Advisory Committee : NVPO staffs and oversees the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC), a federal advisory committee Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 16 charged to advise and make recommendations t o the Assistant Secretary for Health on the means to achieve optimal prevention of human infectious diseases through immunization. Specifically, NVAC studies and recommends ways to encourage the availability of an adequate supply of safe and effective vacc ines in the United States; recommends research priorities and other measures to enhance the safety and efficacy of vaccines; advises on the implementation of the national vaccine program responsibilities; and annually identifies the most important areas of federal and non - federal cooperation that should be considered in implementing the national va ccine program responsibilities. VI. Innovation Challenges and Opportunities The U.S. vaccine enterprise is well established and has been successful in bringing nu merous new and improved products to the market. Federal agencies are central in this role, supporting key components of the vaccine enterprise (Table 1) . Government policies can support an enabling environment within the vaccine enterprise. A recent exampl e is a change to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), a federal program that provides compensation to individuals injured by certain vaccine s. While the VICP has always covered vaccines recommended by the CDC for routine administration to child ren, the p assage of the 21st Century Cures Act expanded VICP coverage to include vaccines recommended by the CDC for routine administration in pregnant women . This important expansion of VICP coverage encourages innovation and development by expanding liability protections under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 . Challenges and Opportunities The remaining targets for vaccine development are challenging the enterprise: they are scientifically complex ; may require new tools to evaluate the ir safety and efficacy ; target sub - populations most impacted by disease rather than the general population ; and may not be considered high public health priorities. Addressing these new and different challenges by reducing or eliminating potential obstacle s may shift the balance of risk and reward to favor investments in innovation . As a participant in the vaccine network, USG actions and policies can act as levers to promote vaccine innovation and address many of the challenges characterized in this repor t. Four specific challenges are described below; potential opportunities (italicized) to enhance existing activities and implement new efforts are also presented. Such activities are supported by multiple HHS agencies and offices. Limited understanding of the science to develop optimal vaccines . There is a limited understanding of the pathogenesis and immune responses against some targeted infectious agents, lack of optimal immune response to potential vaccine candidates , and a limited understanding of the mechanism of protection of some vaccine Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 17 candidates. Correlates of protection may be required for a vaccine candidate to be measured as effective. These correlates may not exist for some candidates. Opportunity: Enhancing scientific understanding of mechan isms involved in immune responses to infection and vaccination. Basic and applied science is the foundation of vaccine development. The USG, through NIH and CDC , provides substantial support for studies to better understand key immunological characteristics of vulnerable populations, such as neonates, infants, and the elderly, that are aimed at developing more effective vaccines to protect these groups. Federal i nvestments in adjuvant discovery and development show promise in exhibiting different immune stimulatory properties. This provides a tool box for developers looking to produce novel vaccine candidates for specific age groups (e.g., the very young and older adults). Additionally, continued support for translational research and clinical vaccine development and evaluation can be critical for innovative products, particularly for small companies that do not have the resources to ful ly develop a product. Challe nging clinical trial design for specific populations. Conducting clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of certain preventive vaccines may be particularly challenging for several reasons, including: relatively low disease incidence (e.g., cong enital cytomegalovirus disease; neonatal group B streptococcal disease); limited infrastructure in affected geographic areas (e.g., Ebola virus vaccines), ethical considerations (e.g., assessing novel approaches to pertussis vaccination of pregnant women t o prevent neonatal pertussis where vaccination of pregnant women is already recommended); or new settings (e.g., hospital acquired infections). Opportunity: Using regulatory flexibility and novel scientific tool development. FDA's implementation of innovat ive and flexible regulatory mechanisms and pathways has ensured that approval of vaccine candidates keeps pace with technological and scientific advances. FDA recognizes that novel scientific tools will be necessary to translate scientific discoveries into safe and effective vaccines for infectious diseases that address important health concerns and benefit public health. To this end, FDA has efforts underway regarding the development and use of novel clinical trial designs, including the use of biomarkers, innovative statistical analysis techniques, and real world evidence to facilitate vaccine innovation and development as described in Table 5 . Converging regulatory requirements across countries. Regulatory convergence across countries may decreas e the resources required to engage in a global market. Increasing opportunities to align regulatory processes and, where possible, regulatory standards could cut redundancies, time, and costs associated with navigating requirements in multiple countries. Opportunity: Enhancing global activities. Using FDA best practices to expand regulatory convergence may decrease the resources required by companies to engage in a global market. Examples include adoption of internationally recognized technical guidance do cuments, standards and scientific principles, common or similar practices Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 18 and procedures, or adoption of regulatory mechanisms that might be specific to a local legal context, but that align with shared principles to achieve a common public health goal. Im proving coordination with other countries such as agreement on clinical endpoints, where feasible, and assay and batch -release testing results, could have an impact on timelines and vaccine availability. Uncertain ROI for new and improved vaccines. The gre ater the uncertainty in the technical development, regulatory licensure, and vaccine uptake, the higher the risk to industry. Unclear estimates of disease burden, including mortality and morbidity estimates; future ACIP recommendations; insurance coverage; perception of individual risk; and patient and health care provider belief in the value of the vaccine product all contribute to uncertainty. Opportunities: Increasing surveillance and epidemiological studies. Epidemiological surveillance is critical to (1) assess disease burden that informs which targets are important to public health for development; such data supports clinical trial design and shapes the final target product profile of the vaccine; and (2) id entify needs for new vaccines or effectiveness concerns among existing vaccines. CDC gathers reliable epidemiological data to support clinical trial design and shape the final product profile of the vaccine. CDC and NIH also support efforts to enhance glo bal activities in surveillance as well as development of global clinical trial sites. If the epidemiology of a disease shifts, reliable epidemiological data is required to understand the burden of disease and confirm the specific population at risk for the disease to determine whether vaccination is an appropriate strategy and if current devel opment programs are on target. Enhancing communication frequency and transparency with the USG and external stakeholders including industry. Continued communication between FDA and industry can decrease regulatory uncertainty by discussing data needed for a desired indication in the early stages of development. Further , with regard to potential recommendations for use, improved communication between CDC and industry may help reduce uncertainty about the implementation of new vaccine policy and programs. In addition, CDC has standardized ACIP working group guidelines so various working group approaches and timelines for communicating with vaccine developers are more pre dictable. Improving vaccine uptake. Uptake of existing vaccines in a given population may predict uptake of new vaccines in that population. Ongoing efforts to improve vaccine uptake across the lifespan and among persons at increased risk for vaccine -preve ntable diseases or their complications should be sustained. Increasing uptake of currently available vaccines supports investment s in new vaccines by increasing the projected market for new products. Public -private partnerships. Historically, vaccine innov ation has been driven by disease epidemiology, burden, and severity. However, for some high priority vaccine Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 19 targets, public -private partnerships are centra l to facilitating development. Vaccines for pandemic influenza preparedness or biodefense, such as smallpox and anthrax vaccines, are purchased solely by the government as there is no viable commercial interest or market. In such situations , public -private partnerships are leveraged. Fo r example, BARDA's advanced vaccine development and procurement programs are conducted in partnership with industry as a critical component of public health preparedness against a wide range of threats. Development of vaccines with small markets or a low e stimated ROI could benefit from public -private partnerships with federal support. Public -private partnerships are important to facilitate development of high-priority products. USG investment could be leveraged to develop certain vaccines that would not be undertaken without incentives. VII. Conclusion Much progress has been made in understanding the complex scientific issues inherent in making a vaccine; adapting regulatory needs to a changing environment; and supporting policies that facilitate progress a nd innovation. Sustained USG investments in critical areas are needed to translate advances in science and discovery into vaccine innovations that improve health and quality of life in the United States. Catalytic investments in some areas as identified above may further propel innovations toward licensure and delivery. For example, a systematic, evidence -based process to assess and communicate public health needs for new and improved vaccines , including a critical review of disease epidemiology, the merits of individual targets, gaps in information, and efforts to address these gaps could spur innovation. Understanding the issues facing key stakeholders and their respective roles and contributions to the vaccine network could also help unify and focus effor ts on several vaccine targets while strengthening the U.S. vaccine enterprise to face future challenges in the decades to come. Innovative and flexible public -private partnerships are essential to incentivize development of vaccines that would not otherwis e reach licensure due to unfavorable ROI as compared to other therapeutic products. As a result of continuous development and innovation, vaccines have had a profound impact, protecting Americans across the lifespan. This report outlines challenges and opp ortunities facing the vaccine enterprise that, if addressed, could spur continued progress and innovation toward the availability of future vaccines to improve public health in the 21st century.

When considering a biopharmaceutical company's request f or Fast Track designation for an investigational drug or biologic, the FDA evaluates whether it will affect factors such as survival, day -to-day functioning, or the likelihood that the disease, if left untreated, will progress from a less severe condition to a more serious one, and whether a condition can be adequately addressed by available therapy. With Fast Track designation, early and frequent communication between the FDA and the biopharmaceutical company is encouraged throughout the entire drug develo pment and review process to help to quickly Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 31 resolve any questions or issues that arise, potentially leading to an earlier approval and access by patients. Orphan Designation \u2014Upon request by a sponsor, the FDA can grant special status (\"orphan status\") to a drug or biologic to treat a rare disease or condition. In order to receive an orphan designation, a qualifying drug or biologic must be intended for the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a rare disease or condition that affects usually fewer than 200 ,000 people in the United States. Phase 1 \u2014Researchers test the investigational drug or biologic in a small group of people, usually between 20 and 100 healthy adult volunteers, to evaluate its initial safety and tolerability profile, determine a safe dosag e range, and identify potential side effects. Phase 2 \u2014The investigational drug or biologic is given to volunteer patients, usually between 100 and 500, to determine whether it is effective, identify an optimal dose, and to further evaluate its short -term s afety. Phase 3 \u2014The investigational drug or biologic is given to a larger, more diverse patient population, often involving between 1, 000 and 5,000 patients (but sometimes many more), to generate statistically significant evidence to confirm its safety and effectiveness. Phase III studies are the longest studies and usually take place in multiple sites around the world.

Breakthrough Therapy designation is based on the following criteria: 1) The product is intended to be used alone or in combination with one or more drugs to treat a serious or life -threatening disease or condition and 2) Preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant study endpoint(s) over available therapies. Breakthrough therapy desi gnation provides the manufacturer more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient vaccine development program, thereby facilitating the scientific evaluation during the Investinational New Drug Application ( IND) stage; an organizational commitment involving se nior managers and experienced review staff . FDA may consider a \"rolling review\" of the Biologics License Application (BLA) ; this allows sponsors to submit sections of the BLA to FDA for review as they are completed, as opposed to waiting to submit the com plete BLA at one time. FDA has approved two vaccines that had Breakthrough Therapy designation, both for Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 32 the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. Fast Track Designation The Food and Drug Administratio n Modernization Act of 1997 mandates the Agency to, at the request of the sponsor, facilitate the development and expedite review of drugs, including biological products, intended to treat serious or life -threatening diseases or conditions and that demonst rate the potential to address unmet medical needs. Fast Track adds to existing programs, such as accelerated approval, the possibility of a \"rolling review\" for an application. An important feature of fast track is that it emphasizes the critical nature of close and early communication between FDA and the sponsor to improve the efficiency of product development. Numerous vaccines have been approved that received Fast Track Designation, including vaccines for the prevention of cervical cancer and cholera. Priority Review Vaccines that hold the promise of delivering a significant improvement over existing therapy for serious or life -threatening conditions can be designated for \"priority\" review, and a shortened six -month FDA review goal. Numerous vaccines hav e been approved that had Priority Review status, including vaccines to prevent cervical cancer, invasive meningococcal serogroup B disease, cholera, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Accelerated Approval This program, begun in the early 1990s, allows FDA to approve products for serious or life -threatening conditions based on evidence of a product's effectiveness that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, reducing the time it takes for needed medical products to become available to the publi c. Such approval may be subject to verification of clinical benefit through additional studies conducted after approval (Phase 4 studies) . Since its creation, the accelerated approval program has been used to approve numerous vaccines, including those to p revent influenza, Haemophilus influenzae Type b (Hib) and invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. Table 4: Innovative Regulatory Mechanisms Mechanism Description Animal Rule In 2002, a rule was promulgated that allows animal efficacy data to be used as a basis for approval, when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible to conduct. The relevant regulations permits FDA to license vaccines based on adequate and well controlled animal studies when the resul ts of those animal studies establish that the vaccine is reasonably likely to produce clinical benefit in humans, provided that safety in humans has been established. The use of anthrax vaccine for the prevention of anthrax after suspected or confirmed exp osure to Bacillus anthracis when used with recommended antimicrobial therapy was approved using the Animal Rule pathway. Adaptive Trial Designs FDA is actively involved in working with sponsors to help develop adaptive trial designs. Using this approach, the FDA is seeking to Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines that Minimize the Burden of Infectious Diseases in the 21st Centur y 33 facilitate efficient clinical development and to assure FDA confidence in the results. The goal of these designs is to redu ce the size and duration of the trial, demonstrate an effect if one exists or provide broader dose - response information. These adaptations are performed with close attention to statistical rigor. Table 5: Novel Approaches to Clinical Trials Approach Description Biomarkers A novel approach to clinical trials is the use of biomarkers to evaluate vaccine efficacy more quickly than traditional clinical endpoints. Although biomarkers are currently used in vaccine development, including as surrogate endpoints to support earlier evidence for regulatory decision -making, identification of novel biomarkers to predict safety and efficacy during early and advanced clinical development and regulatory use is critical to advance important new vaccines into dif ferent age bands or populations. Biomarkers that are well validated, help scientists understand the disease process. Innovative Statistical Analysis Techniques Novel statistical methods to analyze data from complex novel trials may provide more rapid, potentially less expensive and more reliable answers about vaccines. For example, innovative statistical methods may help predict if interim evidence of a vaccine's safety and efficacy is likely to be borne out by further study, or if subject accrual needs to be adjusted. Real World Evidence Real world evidence is defined as data regarding the usage, or the potential benefits or risks, of a drug/vaccine derived from sources other than randomized clinical trials. Real world evidence can be derived from a variety of sources relating to the delivery of health care and its outcomes, including observational studies, electronic health records, claims and billing data, and product and disease registries. Use of such evidence has the potential to allow researche rs to answer questions about the effects of a vaccine and outcomes efficiently, saving time and money while yielding answers relevant to broader populations. This could help streamline clinical development and help inform the safe and effective use of vacc ines. Of note, FDA already utilizes real world evidence via its Sentinel Initiative, which is one of the largest uses of this type of information in health care and is proving vital for monitoring vaccine safety and analyzing safety signals. However, the s cience of using evidence from clinical experience to establish vaccine effectiveness, e.g., to evaluate new uses of vaccines, is still in its infancy. Development of methodologies is needed to address the types of data that could be used and how, study des ign and conduct, and analysis methods. "}
