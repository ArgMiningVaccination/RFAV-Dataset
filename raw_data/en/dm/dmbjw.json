Pranic Healing\u00ae is a highly evolved and tested system of energy medicine developed by Grandmaster Choa Kok Sui that utilizes prana to balance, harmonize, and transform the body's energy processes. Prana is a Sanskrit word that means life-force. This invisible bio-energy or vital energy keeps the body alive and maintains a state of good health. In acupuncture, the Chinese refer to this subtle energy as Chi. It is also called Ruach or the Breath of Life in Hebrew. Pranic Healing\u00ae is a simple yet powerful & effective system of no-touch energy healing. It is based on the fundamental principles that the body is a self-repairing living entity that possesses the ability to heal itself and that the healing process is accelerated by increasing this life force that is readily available from the sun, air and ground to address physical & emotional imbalances. Grandmaster Choa Kok Sui says \"Life Energy or prana is all around us. It is pervasive; we are actually in an ocean of Life Energy. Based on this principle, a healer can draw in Pranic Energy or Life Energy from the surroundings.\" | | The Healing Arts Center is excited to announce our NEW Pranic Healing\u00ae 100 Hour Energy Medicine Master Track! Pranic Healing\u00ae requires no drugs, gadgets, not even physical contact with the subject. Physical contact is not required because the practitioner is working on the bioplasmic or energy body and not directly on the physical body. This energy body, or aura, is the mold or blueprint that surrounds and interpenetrates the physical body. It is the energy body that absorbs life energy and distributes it throughout the physical body, to the muscles, organs, glands, etc. The reason Pranic Healing\u00ae works on the energy body is that physical ailments first appear as energetic disruptions in the aura before manifesting as problems in the physical body. This pervasive energy that surrounds, interpenetrates and sustains the physical body, also affects our emotions, our ability to handle stress, relationships and even finances. \"In Ancient times, Pranic Healing\u00ae could only be practiced by an elite few. My job was to develop a very effective healing system, which ordinary people could learn in just a short period. Anybody can practice Pranic Healing\u00ae now. The knowledge of being able to deal with simple ailments is quite empowering.\" -Grandmaster Choa Kok Sui Master Choa Kok Sui developed Pranic Healing\u00ae as a comprehensive System of energy medicine to improve the quality of our every day lives.

How Does Pranic Healing\u00ae Work? All beings have an energy field around them, often known as the aura that looks like a luminous ball of light. Aura works as the battery of a cellphone; it keeps the body healthy and alive. Anything in life that disturb us, such as stress at work, fear, sadness and loneliness, arguments and frustrations, makes this luminous energy field dimmer, imbalanced and full of holes and greyish energies. This, in long run appears as pain, discomfort, physical and psychological problems. Most people use medicine to remove their illnesses. Although it is a necessary thing to do, but in many cases has side effects, or especially dealing with psychological issues, since the cause has not been addressed could not be completely cured. The better solution is using complementary treatment, along with medicine! With Pranic Healing\u00ae, we are able to detect the problems and imbalances in the aura and carefully remove them using a fairly simple technique that involves no touching, no drug and anyone can learn to do it. Once the aura is balanced and bright, our physical and psychological health is guaranteed.
