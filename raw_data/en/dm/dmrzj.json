Men who have sex with men now qualify to receive the JYNNEOS vaccine if they met partners through a website, app or social event, like a bar or party, in the last two weeks. Previously the vaccine was restricted to two categories: people who had skin-to-skin contact with someone with the virus, and men who have sex with men and who have had multiple or anonymous partners in the previous two weeks. Dallas County received 5,000 more vials of the monkeypox vaccine between Friday and Monday. That equates to up to 25,000 doses when administered through a new method that requires only one fifth of a vial. \"We are catching up on all of the people who called our phone line and made appointments and got on the wait list. We've whittled down our waitlist and our capacity continues to increase, so we're happy to be able to have some vaccines to open it up a little wider,\" said Dr. Philip Huang, Dallas County's top health official. Dallas County reported 348 confirmed cases as of Tuesday, accounting for the largest portion of monkeypox cases in the state. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 1,048 cases in Texas on the same day. Nationally, there are 12,689 monkeypox cases, with New York (2,620), California (1,945) and Florida (1,268) reporting the highest totals. [What college students should know about monkeypox](/news/education/2022/08/15/monkeypox-covid-loom-large-as-college-students-prepare-for-the-fall-semester/) Huang said the county continues to be relatively strict about who qualifies to get the two-dose regimen because vaccine remains in short supply nationwide. Dallas County Health and Human Services looked to other areas, including New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles when deciding on eligibility requirements. Some other cities have much wider criteria. In Houston and Harris County, people over the age of 18 may be eligible to get the shot if they have HIV, were diagnosed with chlamydia in the last year, were diagnosed with gonorrhea or early syphilis within the last three months or if they're on PrEP, an HIV prevention medication. Harris County had 327 total cases as of Monday. [County Judge Lina Hidalgo tweeted](https://twitter.com/LinaHidalgoTX/status/1559634416779010048) Tuesday that a child under 2 years old tested presumptively positive for the smallpox-like virus. \"Bottom line, we're trying to get people who are high risk, and we don't want people who are just worried about that but are not high risk,\" Huang said. \"Even with the vaccine we have, and we've gotten more, it's still not an unlimited supply, and we want to make it count.\" Recently, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the emergency use of the new vaccination method in an effort to stretch the short-supplied vaccine treatment. Now, smaller doses can be injected between layers of skin rather than beneath the skin. The expanded eligibility requirements come less than two weeks after Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins [issued an emergency declaration](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2022/08/05/dallas-county-declares-emergency-due-to-monkeypox-outbreak/) over the monkeypox outbreak. Jenkins said the county is using the declaration to source more doses of the vaccine. The Texas Department of State Health Services will probably receive more doses within the next week to distribute throughout the state, department spokesman Chris Van Deusen said Monday. Monkeypox primarily spreads through skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated materials like bedding or clothing. It causes flu-like symptoms and a blistery rash that may be on or near the genitals. While the majority of cases in this outbreak have been in men who have sex with men, the virus can infect anyone, regardless of sexual orientation or age. Dallas County residents who qualify for the vaccine can call the health department's monkeypox hotline at 972-692-2780. Noting thye high call volumes, the health department website urges people to keep trying if the call disconnects. [Worried about monkeypox? "}
