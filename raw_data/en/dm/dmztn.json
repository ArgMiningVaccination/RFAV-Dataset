Pharmaceutical grade essential oils can increase circulation, decrease soreness and discomfort, and calm and relax muscle tissue. The chemical structure of essential oils allows them to be absorbed into the bloodstream via the skin for internal benefit throughout the body within 30 seconds of application. Chiropractors can apply essential oils directly to the skin before and after each chiropractic treatment for lasting results. Favorite Essential Oils Used by Chiropractors Soothing Essential Oil Blend The soothing blend is great for sore muscles and joints. Wintergreen, camphor, peppermint, blue tansy, German chamomile, helichrysum and osmanthus work together to ease achy joints and sore muscles. Its effects are deep and penetrating with sustained results. Massage Essential Oil Blend The massage blend combines the therapeutic benefits of oils well-known to relax muscles, calm tension, soothe irritated tissue, increase circulation, and smooth limbs. A popular massage blend consists of essential oils of basil, grapefruit, cypress, marjoram, peppermint, and lavender. Grounding Essential Oil Blend Everyone experiences moments of anxiousness. The warm, woody aroma of the grounding blend, creates a sense of calm and well-being. This blend combines Spruce, Ho Wood, Frankincense, and Blue Tansy to offer an enticing fragrance which promotes tranquility and a sense of balance. Tension Essential Oil Blend The tension blend addresses discomfort associated with head and neck tension, provides calming comfort with the strength of therapeutic grade essential oils of wintergreen, lavender, peppermint, frankincense, cilantro, marjoram, roman chamomile, basil, and rosemary. Wintergreen Wintergreen is a wonderful single essential oil soothing achy muscles and joints. Warning: Do not use Wintergreen with patients who are on blood thinning medications. Lavender or Serenity Essential Oil Blend Lavender of the Serenity blend (Lavender, Cedarwood, Ho Wood, Ylang Ylang, Marjoram, Roman Chamomile, Vetiver, Vanilla Bean Absolute, Hawaiian Sandalwood), are wonderful tools when patients feel anxious about their visit or chiropractic treatment. Applying these essential oils to the inside of the wrists and over the heart area or diffusing them in the treatment room or waiting area can have calming and soothing effects. Chiropractors Value Quality & Consistency The Pure Tested Grade Essential Oils I use and recommend for my clients are 100% pure, natural, aromatic compounds carefully extracted from plants, following the strictest quality control protocol in the essential oils industry. They do not contain fillers or artificial ingredients that would dilute their active qualities and are free of contaminants such as pesticides, heavy metals or other chemical residues. As important as it is to keep contaminants out of our essential oils, assuring the presence of their active compounds, at the right levels, and consistency from bottle to bottle, is necessary to guarantee safety, effectiveness, and pharmaceutical grade level.
