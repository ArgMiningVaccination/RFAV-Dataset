This is a brief meeting between you and the doctor to determine if you may be helped by the services we provide. If the doctor thinks we may be able to help you, he will recommend an examination to gather more information regarding your health condition. - Exams An examination consists of orthopedic, neurological, and chiropractic tests to determine the origin of your problem(s). If the doctor feels as though X-Rays are needed following the examination, they can be performed immediately on site. If the doctor recommends other diagnostic procedures (i.e. MRI, CT scan, etc.) beyond our scope, an appropriate referral will be made. - X-rays To help properly evaluate your condition, digital X-Rays will be taken, if necessary. The doctor will read the xrays and be able to determine if you have arthritis, disc degeneration, spinal misalignment or other pathologies which will affect the way we treat you. The doctors use Posture Ray software to aid in the analysis of spinal xrays and to measure abnormal deviations. The patients at our chiropractic clinic, Harker Heights can easily see exactly what corrections are necessary and track the progress of treatment, whether for spinal subluxations, scoliosis or a ligamentous injury secondary to traumatic event. - Chiropractic Adjustments A chiropractic adjustment refers to a process in which a trained chiropractor uses his fingers or a specialized instrument to apply sudden force with controlled pressure on a spinal joint. We provide chiropractic adjustments to restore joint mobility through gentle spinal or pelvic manipulations, at our Harker Heights clinic. Once the normal range of motion of the joint is restored through these manipulations, it has a direct effect on the nervous system of the patient as well as their general body mechanics. Also known as spinal manipulations, these chiropractic adjustments help to improve the physical function of the body by correcting the structural alignment. This therapy relies on the body's natural ability to heal itself. It is based on the principle that the body's structural and functional abilities are closely intertwined, which is why the structural corrections achieved by the chiropractic adjustments performed at our Harker Heights clinic have a direct impact on the functional abilities of the body, hence encouraging self-healing. - Extremity Adjustments Most people have a very limited idea of what chiropractors actually do. Although we get great results with back and neck pain, we can also work on other joints in the body including the jaw, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, hips, knees, ankles and feet. Many patients in Harker Heights and surrounding locations have enjoyed great non-surgical outcomes with problems such as TMJ dysfunction, rotator cuff syndrome, and carpel tunnel syndrome just to name a few. - Pediatric Chiropractic Chiropractors have been providing safe, effective, drug-free care for children for more than 100 years. The birth process, no matter how natural the experience, can create spinal misalignments which effect how a child grows and develops if unaddressed. For this reason more parents are electing to have their child checked by a chiropractor shortly after birth even in the absence of symptoms. As a child grows they take all kinds of falls, trips, and spills which obviously impact musculoskeletal function and therefore nervous system function. The nervous system is responsible for growth and development and misalignments can lead to dysfunction in all areas of health. Many common childhood complaints respond favorably to adjustments. Newborn health complaints such as colic, acid reflux, breastfeeding disturbances and poor sleep habits can often be traced back to nerve system stress caused by spinal and cranial misalignments. Childhood complaints like chronic ear and respiratory infections, asthma, bed wetting, and many other issues can often be benefitted through chiropractic by addressing the spine and nervous system. Before any treatment is provided, a provider trained in pediatric care will do a thorough examination to determine what issues may exist to determine what treatment, if any, is necessary. Treatment recommendations will be made to the parent/guardian so they understand the treatment to be given. - Pregnancy Chiropractic For many years, women have known about the benefit of chiropractic care during pregnancy. Thankfully this is becoming a more mainstream concept and medical doctors are now referring their pregnant patients to us for care. By creating and maintaining optimal spinal and pelvic alignment, moms find pregnancy to be more comfortable and are ultimately better prepared for a safer, easier birth. Of course, anytime is a great time for a more optimally functioning body. This is especially true when your body is being put under the stress of pregnancy. Pregnant mothers find their adjustments improve their pregnancy and make delivery easier for themselves and their baby. Many women have aches and pains through pregnancy and chiropractic is a great, drug-free way of managing those discomforts. Adjusting methods are always adapted to a patient's size, weight, age, and current condition of health. Our chiropractors utilize the Webster technique for pregnant patients. The Webster technique is a specific chiropractic analysis and diversified adjustment. The goal of the adjustment is to reduce the effects of the sacral subluxation or SI joint dysfunction. In doing so, neuro-biomechanical function in the pelvis is improved. - Proactive Care When patients come to our office, our concern is for their overall health, not just their present complaint. Of course, we pay special attention to their specific complaints, be we do so while addressing other issues before they become more serious. This approach to healthcare allows our patients to be proactive as opposed to reactive. We often recommend care beyond traditional chiropractic care to help each individual achieve their optimal health. Some of the services we recommend are available through our office while others are referred out. This includes things like massage therapy, acupuncture, nutrition counseling, nutritional supplement recommendations, personal training, orthotics and shoe fitting, emotional/spiritual counseling, and medical care. - Maintenance Care Once a person has reached their maximum level of improvement from the care we provide, we typically recommend some regiment of maintenance care. Because our patients live with all kinds of stress, ongoing healthcare is needed to maintain their best health. Most people do not have anyone providing them this type of proactive care. We are one of the few resources offering ongoing accountability and recommendations to deal with day-to-day health challenges. - Nutrition Recommendations and Supplements Wholesome nutrition plays a key role in attaining optimal health. While the chiropractic adjustments address your structural wellbeing, we also provide nutritional counseling and supplements for holistic health from the inside, out. We only recommend the highest quality whole-food supplements from world-renowned companies such as Standard Process and Mediherb which are only sold by health care professionals. For your convenience, we have many supplements in stock and can quickly order anything we do not carry. Following the popular lifestyle of fast food, convenience eating, dining out, microwave meals, and boxed/bagged/canned foods is taking its toll on our bodies. We can either live that popular lifestyle and end up as obese and unhealthy as the majority, or we can choose the less traveled path that leads to health, wellness, and quality of life for a greater quantity of life. The choice is yours! \"You are what you eat\" is an understatement... junk in, junk out. Focusing on cravings, convenience, or even \"fat free\" food options, as opposed to nutritional value, has left us with many undesirable symptoms. If you or your child are experiencing weight gain, gas, bloating, indigestion, reflux, constipation/diarrhea, unwanted weight loss, headaches, fatigue, insomnia, allergies, frequent colds/flu/infections, asthma, menstrual problems, urinary dysfunction, circulation issues, anxiety, depression, colic, behavioral problems, ADD/ADHD, (and the list goes on!) then look to making a serious change in your eating habits. Believe it or not, you can reverse a lot of the damage done to your body and relieve many of these symptoms through chiropractic care and proper nutrition. - Patient Education Classes At Corrective Chiropractic & Wellness, we offer a variety of patient education classes to teach our patients and the general population about the human body, how it works and how to make it work better and more efficiently. We offer a New Patient Class weekly at our clinic. We also offer classes on Spinal Health, Detoxification and Weight Loss, Top 10 Health Myths and Whole Food vs Natural vs Synthetic Supplements, Biomechanics, Sports Injury Prevention, Posture and Form, and more. Many classes are offered outside of our office and we are happy to offer free education for your group. Please call our clinic at 254-698-1600 and ask for Ursula if your organization or company is interested in free health education. - Posture and Spinal Screenings Posture and spinal screenings play a vital role in the diagnosis of important health information and can go a long way in identifying the steps that need to be taken for the patient's wellness. Our chiropractors provide free screenings at community events, health fairs, workplaces, fitness centers, shopping malls, etc. We have several different screening methods we use to check for posture and alignment. Contact us today to arrange a screening at your event or workplace. Call our clinic at 254-698-1600 and ask for Ursula. - - Auto Accident Injuries After an accident it is recommend you go to the Emergency Room to be checked for fractures, internal bleeding or any other life threatening injuries. ERs are great at emergency care. At the ER you will be given an evaluation to detect major injuries, they may do imaging and you will most likely be prescribed a muscle relaxer, pain killer, and an anti-inflammatory medication. These prescriptions are great at treating symptoms, but do nothing to promote proper healing, normal joint function, or restore proper nervous system balance. After going to the ER, you should go to a chiropractor to be evaluated for more subtle, but clinically significant, injuries that the ER is not trained to check for. Chiropractors are a common stop for people after an accident, because they specialize at treating these injuries. Before treatment, a consultation will be provided to determine if it is likely that you need chiropractic care. If so, following the consultation, a thorough examination will be performed. Depending on the consultation and examination findings, weight bearing x-rays including stress films may be taken to determine the extent of the injuries. Common treatments we offer after an automobile injury include, but are not limited to, instrument driven or manual spinal adjustments, extraspinal (shoulder, elbow, knee, hip, wrist, TMJ, etc.) adjustments, low level laser therapy, muscle stimulation, intersegmental traction, rehabilitation, and spinal curve correction traction. Most people do not get the care they need after an auto injury and they pay for it later (with their bodies and their wallets). Many do not get care because they fear the expense. Most auto insurance policies offer Personal Injury Protection (PIP) or Med Pay, which are designed to pay for medical care following an auto injury. If you are involved in an accident, schedule a free consultation with our office and let us find out what insurance coverage may be available to cover the cost of your care. Attorney referrals available as needed. - Athletic Performance and Sports Injury Care Chiropractic care is used by top athletes around the world to achieve full athletic potential, help prevent future injuries and to treat injuries when they do occur. When you are an athlete, you are constantly putting your body under stress. This stress causes dysfunction throughout your body which limits your athletic potential and makes you more susceptible to injury. For this reason every athlete should seek maintenance care (chiropractic, massage, acupuncture, etc.). - Rehabilitation Despite the best efforts, some injuries are unavoidable. Having the right care to promote healing and resume activity as soon as possible, while avoiding re-injury, is imperative. Combining spinal manipulation, extraspinal manipulation, soft tissue mobilization, various modalities and rehabilitation as needed, allows us to design a specific program to suit the individual needs of each patient. This helps to rehabilitate the injured or dysfunctional area by focusing on the underlying muscle weakness and imbalance, instead of merely alleviating the symptoms. - Spinal Decompression A non-surgical treatment for degenerated, bulging and herniated discs, Spinal Decompression Therapy is effective at stretching the spine to increase the space between discs. This pain-free therapy has a very high rate of success at reducing or even eliminating neck and back pain. As an alternative to surgery, decompression restores nutrient flow to the discs, takes pressure off the nerves, and helps to prevent further disc problems to help minimize the debilitating pain and discomfort associated with disc issues. Spinal discs are the \"spacers\" between vertebrae that help cushion the spine that keep the bones from rubbing together and causing spinal degeneration. With continuous or accumulated damage, these discs can become worn, compressed, bulging, or herniated. Lower back pain, sciatica, neck pain, and a variety of symptoms can be caused by damaged or degenerated spinal discs. Corrective Chiropractic & Wellness uses a state-of-the-art machine which is considered the leading non-surgical alternative to relieve symptoms of cervical and lumbar disc degeneration. Due to the non-invasive and effective nature of this traction treatment, millions of people in Harker Heights and surrounding locations suffering from degenerative disc disease and the painful symptoms associated with it have been given new hope! The treatment lasts less than 20 minutes and is administered while you are fully clothed. The Decompression Unit will take each patient through cycles of stretch and relaxation, which peak after several minutes. Most of our patients report a noticeable difference after only a few treatments. There are several position options for your comfort and for the success of the treatment. Patient Benefits of Spinal Decompression: - Helps reduce/eliminate back and neck pain - Releases pressure on the nerves - Improved circulation of spinal fluids - Pain-free alternative to surgery - Reduction in disc degeneration and thinning - Non-invasive and effective treatment - \"IST\" Inter-Segmental Traction combines the use of gentle rollers and vibration (optional) to induce passive motion in the spine. By stretching the spinal joints, there is an increase in mobility, circulation, healing, and a reduction in the degeneration and/or thinning of discs. Patients simply lie face up on the IST table, relax, and let one of our Chiropractic Assistants activate the motion which consists of rollers that slowly move up and down the spine and the optional constant vibration. The soothing motion and gentle rolling action exercises the spine without effort and is found to be very restful. Discs often have poor blood supply as fixations prevent the natural flow of fluid from the surrounding spinal joints. This can cause disc degeneration and thinning. By stimulating and stretching the spine you increase the circulation of blood, help stop further degeneration, and begin the healing process. Patient Benefits of IST: - Relaxing, comfortable, rejuvenating - Increased spinal mobility - Improved circulation of spinal fluids - Increased mobility and healing - Reduction in disc degeneration and thinning - Low Level Laser Low level laser therapy (LLLT) or cold laser, is a painless, sterile, non-invasive, drug-free modality that is used for a variety of conditions such as, acute and chronic pain, body-contouring, acne and cellulite. Housed within the mitochondria, the cell energy manufacturer, are receptors capable of absorbing distinct parameters of light. Think of these receptors like any drug receptors. When we consume a prescription medication, the compound is absorbed by the body and it locates a particular receptor, and based upon its molecular design, will bind to that receptor. Once the drug binds, a secondary reaction inside the cell takes place. A similar mechanism is observed when exposing the body to a particular color of light. During a laser treatment the light will penetrate the skin and is absorbed by this receptor within the mitochondria. Receptor stimulation with light promotes energy production, biochemical reactions, protein and growth factor synthesis, cell growth and proliferation and enhanced blood and oxygen flow. Patient Benefits of Low Level Laser Therapy: - Stimulate repair of tissue - Reduce inflammation - Relieve pain in musculoskeletal disorders - \"STIM\" Electrical Stimulation This interferential electrical therapy is different than an at-home TENS unit. The STIM uses two different low frequency stimulations that are placed diagonal of the injury area allowing the waves to intersect and promote pain relief and healing. Natural endorphins and other natural painkillers are induced by these tiny electrical impulses that are described as having a faint \"pins and needles\" sensation. It is a therapeutic treatment that relieves pain and decreases swelling and inflammation through alternating electrical wavelength frequencies. It is also a therapeutic treatment to aid in soft tissue healing. igament sprains, muscle strains and spasms often respond very well to this treatment. Patient Benefits of STIM: - Reduces Painful Symptoms - Decreases Local Swelling - Promotes Muscle Tone - Restores Normal Movements - Releases the Body's Natural Pain Killers - Accelerates the Healing Process - Ultrasound Therapy Ultrasound therapy refers to the therapeutic treatment of soft tissue injuries by the administration of high-frequency sound waves to the affected region. These high-speed waves generate a heat response in the injured tissue, leading to a therapeutic healing effect. This is brought about by the breakdown of calcium and other dangerous deposits in the soft tissue by the vibrations and heat in the ultrasound waves. The transmission of these waves to the skin is achieved by the use of a gel which might feel cool when applied to the skin at room temperature. The ultrasound treatment is applied at the site of injury and penetrates deep into the body, causing a rise in temperature which helps to relax muscle spasms, massage damage tissues, increase blood flow to the injured site, and ultimately speed the recovery process. Patient Benefits of Ultrasound Therapy: : - Dissolving calcium deposits - Improving blood flow, and hence speeding metabolism and the healing process - Providing relief from nerve root irritation - Effective in the treatment of shoulder, elbows, and other sports-related injuries - Curve Restoration Traction Traction applied to the spine to restore or decrease the curves of the spine as viewed from the side. Research has determined the amount of curve that is appropriate for the various regions of the spine. Abnormal spinal curves make the spine more prone to degeneration, disc bulges, disc herniations, and other injuries. - Core Muscle Strength Training Beyond all the muscles in the legs and arms, the core is the most essential part of the body to possess strength and stability. Core muscle weakness is a major cause of many musculoskeletal problems and pain syndromes. By developing proper core muscles, many problems can be resolved as well as preventing future injuries. Your \"core\" is the same thing as your torso or trunk which extends from the shoulders down to the buttocks and hips, including everything in between. Many people think working the \"abs\" by doing crunches is all they need to do but the abdominals make up a very small portion of the core. Crunches are beneficial only if done properly, to protect the lower back, and need to be augmented with a variety of core exercises to achieve functional strength. Core strength and stability is considered \"functional training\" in that it enhances the day-to-day routine work you put your body through and makes daily chores easier, faster, and safer by stabilizing the spine during lifting, twisting, contraction, stretching, and other movements. - Muscle Stretching and Joint Flexibility Exercises Because the skeletal system and musclular system work together constantly, the focus on muscle and joint care is paramount when dealing with structural issues. If you are not including enough stretching and flexibility exercises in your routine, your body will start to feel the effects of constantly contracted muscles and limited joint range of motion. This condition can easily lead to increased injuries. We will show you specific exercises that will help to reduce muscle strain, increase flexibility, and even reduce pain. - Posture Correction The constant structural position of your body, known as your posture, and in exercise your 'form,' has a tremendous impact on your health and vitality. Bad posture is a leading cause of spinal pain and other symptoms, as well as loss of function and spinal curvature. There are also a host of soft tissue problems associated with poor posture. Good posture optimizes the function and form of your body, and is crucial to your quality and quantity of life. providing enough room and protection for these vital areas. Proper posture not only offers health and longevity to your spine, it allows your lungs to receive enough oxygen, gives your heart room to pump powerfully, keeps the digestive system moving smoothly, and allows all your organs to do their jobs without restricting the physical space needed to function properly. Considering that all but one of your major organs are in your torso (your brain is in the skull), the positioning of the skeletal and muscular systems are key in We will show you what the best posture is for you and how to maintain it! Posture correction can be achieved through a combination of chiropractic manipulations, tractioning procedures, and posture exercises. The doctors will make recommendations as needed per your initial and progress exams. Voted BEST in Killeen and Harker Heights 9 Years in a Row!
