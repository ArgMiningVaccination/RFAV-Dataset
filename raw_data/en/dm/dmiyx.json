What to know about when, where to get it The first doses of a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 have arrived at New Jersey hospitals and [health care workers at University Hospital in Newark were the first recipients](https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/coronavirus/2020/12/13/nj-covid-vaccine-university-hospital-newark-workers-first/6529769002/) Tuesday morning. Here's what we know so far about when \u2014 and how \u2014 they will become available, as well as who will get it first. Who gets COVID vaccine first in NJ? When will the COVID vaccine be distributed? It depends on what priority group you are in. Gov. Phil Murphy has said that anyone who wants to get a vaccine should be able to get it by late April or May. The details about timing and the criteria for inclusion in each group become less detailed after the first group targeted for vaccination. Based on current projections, these are the groups and when they are expected to have access to the vaccine: Through January: Health care workers, residents of long-term-care facilities and everyone who works in long-term-care facilities (Group 1A). In New Jersey, that includes an estimated 600,000 health care workers and 45,000 residents of long-term-care. Health care workers not only include hospital staffs, but also home health aides, pharmacy workers, emergency medical service workers and those who work in out-patient clinics, according to CDC guidelines. State Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli has said the state will follow CDC guidelines. The initial distribution of up to 76,050 doses falls short of that number, however. Hospitals have said staff who are directly exposed to patients with COVID-19 or to members of the public who are potentially infected (for example, an emergency department clerk) will be first in line. More shipments will follow, and starting on Dec. 28, long-term-care facilities will begin to receive the vaccine. The state will open six mega-sites in mid-January for health care workers who are not associated with hospitals to receive the vaccine. It will communicate information about how to make an appointment in the coming weeks. See below for locations. From mid-January through February: Essential workers, including teachers and others in the educational sector; police, firefighters, corrections officers; food and agriculture workers; and those in the transportation industry. Specific priorities within this group, known as 1B, have not been spelled out yet. They will be determined by the Department of Health's professional advisory committee, based on guidance from the national Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. February and March: Those aged 65 and older, and adults with high-risk medical conditions. End of March, April and May: Anyone not in the above categories. FAQs: [Are there side effects to a COVID-19 vaccine? What are the 'ingredients'? The cost? Answers to your vaccine questions](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/12/02/covid-vaccine-pfizer-moderna-astrazeneca-what-to-know/6476436002/) Where to go: [COVID vaccine is almost here. Six NJ hospitals to get early shipments](https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/coronavirus/2020/12/03/covid-vaccine-nj-hospitals-get-shipments-advance/3801558001/) COVID vaccine and pregnancy Research is not yet available on the safety of the vaccines during pregnancy. Experts believe the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, because of the way they use messenger RNA rather than live virus to stimulate an immune response, are unlikely to pose a risk to people who are pregnant. The CDC reports that being pregnant increases the risk of severe illness from COVID-19. [The CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html) and the [independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/slides-12-12/COVID-03-Mbaeyi.pdf)recommend that pregnant people consult with their doctors about the risks and benefits of vaccination for COVID. . Should I take the COVID vaccine if I have allergies or asthma? Two serious reactions have occurred in Britain during the first day of the vaccine distribution there this week. As a result, officials are advising that people who have had serious life-threatening reactions (called anaphylactic reactions) in the past to medication, bee stings or foods \u2014 such as difficulty breathing, alarming drops in blood pressure or passing out, should wait to get the vaccine. But those with more common allergic reactions, and those with asthma, should get the vaccine, since asthma is a risk factor for severe illness if one is infected with COVID. Side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine So far the research from clinical trials has shown only short term side effects, the types one might expect \u2014 soreness in the arm where the shot was given, some low-grade fever, headache and lethargy over the first 24 hours. But no long-term side effects have been observed compared to the placebo group in clinical trials. Will children need the vaccine for school? The Pfizer vaccine currently is not recommended for children younger than 16. Data from the two vaccines likely to be distributed first do not yet include younger children. Pfizer included people as young as 12 in its clinical trials, but the safety and efficacy data from that group is not yet available. Moderna's clinical trial did not include people younger than 18. Where can I get a COVID vaccine? The initial doses \u2014 from Pfizer \u2014 are being shipped to hospitals that have ultra-cold freezers to store the vaccine at the required temperature. Hospital staff -- paid and unpaid -- will get it at their places of work or at other hospitals, in the early phase. Starting in mid-January, the state plans to open six vaccine mega-sites. They will offer the vaccine to health care workers initially. The six sites will be located at: - The Meadowlands Racetrack, East Rutherford - Rockaway Townsquare Mall, Morris County - New Jersey Convention and Exposition Center, Edison - Moorestown Mall, Burlington County - Rowan College South Jersey, Gloucester County - Atlantic City Convention Center Long-term care residents and workers will get it at their long-term care facilities. CVS and Walgreens have agreements with the federal government to handle distribution in long-term care. CVS has said it will administer the vaccine at 1,100 New Jersey facilities, including nursing homes and assisted living homes, while Walgreens' plans were not available. Vaccinations will start on Dec. 28, beginning at the state-operated veterans' homes. Once the vaccine becomes more broadly available, plans call for it to be administered by county and local health departments, health clinics, some retail pharmacies and primary care practices in New Jersey. Is this a drive-thru vaccination, or do I need an appointment? Health care institutions will have their own protocols for scheduling the vaccine. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, all providers will take measures to avoid lines or crowding. That will include setting up appointments or drive-thru lines. They must provide for a recommended 10- to 15-minute period following vaccination to monitor for allergic reactions. The state plans to open a website to register and make an appointment for a vaccine, when supplies become more widely available. No details are available yet. Can I get a COVID vaccine through my employer? Nationally, some major employers are talking about making the vaccine available in their workplaces. We will learn more as more vaccine supplies become available. How much will the COVID vaccine cost me? The vaccine itself will be free to the American people, through Operation Warp Speed, the federal program. A fee for administration of the vaccine can be charged to Medicaid, Medicare or the patients' private insurance. No additional out-of-pocket fee is to be charged. For uninsured patients, providers can bill that fee to the federal government. What information will they ask for when I get the COVID vaccine? Each person who receives a first dose of the vaccine in New Jersey will be automatically enrolled in the [New Jersey Immunization Information System,](https://www.state.nj.us/health/cd/documents/vpdp/njiis_information_adults.pdf) under an [executive order](https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-207.pdf) issued in November by Murphy. This system already enrolls anyone born after Jan. 1, 1998, to track compliance with mandated school immunizations and avoid unnecessary duplication of vaccines. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, it will also automatically include adults who receive a COVID vaccine. Thirty days after the public health emergency is declared over, adults may \"opt out\" of the registry. Vaccine administrators will need contact information to keep track of which company's vaccine you received and remind you about the need for a second shot. They also are likely to ask for information to determine your priority group and insurance coverage, although the state Department of Health has not answered questions about what specific information will be collected. What about the second shot? Most vaccine administrators plan to book your second appointment and set up a reminder system when you get your first shot. They will probably give you a card indicating which company's vaccine you received. For Pfizer vaccines, the second shot should be three weeks after the first. For Moderna vaccines, it should be four weeks later. It is important not to mix and match the type of vaccine you receive. If you got a Pfizer shot the first time, your second shot must also be from Pfizer. The federal Centers for Disease Control is setting up a central registry to link to the state immunization information systems. If you cannot return to the original site for your second vaccine, this centralized registry is intended to ensure that you receive the appropriate second shot. Who has access to the information collected when I'm vaccinated? Besides the New Jersey Immunization Information System, which will be linked to the Centers for Disease Control, others authorized to access the information include health care providers, local and state health departments and insurance plans. All must have signed confidentiality agreements. Can I be required to get a COVID vaccine? The federal government cannot require anyone to receive a vaccine that has not been fully approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration. The COVID-19 vaccines are to be authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization, which is not the same. Pfizer said it would apply for full approval next April. when more safety data is available. No state law in New Jersey currently requires vaccination against COVID-19. It is not clear whether individual workplaces may make employment conditional on receiving a vaccine. Health care systems in New Jersey that are receiving the first tranche of vaccines have said they recommend, but do not require, their employees to receive it. Who can give the COVID vaccine in New Jersey? The list is long. It includes licensed physicians, physician assistants, nurses (advanced practice nurses, registered nurses and licensed practical nurses), certified nurse midwives, certified medical assistants, certified home health aides, pharmacists, pharmacy externs and pharmacy interns (under supervision of a pharmacist) are currently permitted to give vaccines in New Jersey. The state health commissioner may also take emergency action to allow dentists, perfusionists, respiratory therapists and lab directors to do so. Not allowed under current law: acupuncturists, chiropractors, pharmacy techs, physical therapists and veterinarians, among others. This story will be updated as more information becomes available.
