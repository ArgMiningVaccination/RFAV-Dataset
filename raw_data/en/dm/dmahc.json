The Division is dedicate d to providing exceptional care for the most critically ill patients and is committed to the training of outstanding ph ysicians and scientists. Through the continue d discovery of new knowledge, division faculty and staff strive to help tomorrow's patients as well as improve outcomes for the vulnerable population for whom we care. Directed by Rashmin C. Savani, M.B.Ch.B., t he Division of Neonatal - Perinatal Medicine is comprised of a large group of nationally and internationally recognized faculty membe rs with expertise in virtually all aspects of modern neonatal -perinatal care and state -of- the-art research. In 202 1, the COVID -19 pandemic continued to provide extreme challenges to the Division and to our obstetric colleagues. Through highly collaborative establishment of protocols and procedures, we have attended and managed over 2 000 deliveries of SARS -CoV-2 positive mothers in our four hospitals . We k ept abreast of the latest information from the CDC and the literature and provided education on a local, regional , and statewide basis to help other hospitals cope with the crisis. The effectiveness of these specific protocols is borne out by the fact that not a single member of the team contracted the disease while providing care on our units. The Division's mission is to positively impact the health of neonates in our community, our nation, and worldwide through excellence in patient care, research, and education. That mission is three -fold: Excellence in Neonatal Care Through multidisciplinary and family -centered care, we will strive to improve the standard of practice and ensure the highest quality of care to neonates in our hospitals and around the world. We will care for neonates with the highest respect for their pr ecious lives in a compassionate and caring environment and will utilize evidence -based approaches to clinical care that are regularly evaluated and updated. Leadership in Research We will pursue new knowledge through high -quality research that explores un answered questions, as well as tests and refines previously established ideas in neonatal -perinatal care. As global leaders in research, we will work collaboratively inside and outside our institution in order to generate important discoveries that will le ad to improvements in the care that is provided for neonates worldwide. Education of Future Leaders We will impart knowledge, instill excitement for learning, and translate these into focused areas of research for our neonatal medicine trainees, pediatric residents, medical students and advanced practice providers . We will train future leaders in neonatal medicine who will in turn impart the knowledge and values obtained during their training to those with whom they interact during their careers.

Our goal is to impart knowledge, instill excitement for learning, and translate questions into focused areas of research. Third -Year Medical Students During their pediatrics rotation at UT Southwestern, third -year medical students spend time in the Newborn Nursery at Parkland Hospital. Fourth -Year Medical Students Students in their fourth year at UT Southwestern may elect to spend time in the Newborn Nursery or the Neonatal Intensive Care Units at Parkland Hospital and Children's Medical Center. Residents The design of th e Pediatric Residency Program at UT Southwestern and Children's Medical Center allows for exposure to Neonatal -Perinatal Medicine at Parkland Hospital and elective exposure at Children's throughout the three -year training program. Page | 10 Elective Rotations for Pediatric Residents from External Programs The Division offers the following elective rotations to residents from other programs: Children's Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Parkland Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Texas Health Dallas Presbyterian Hospital NICU Parkland Newborn Nursery Children's Thrive Clinic Research Fellows Vision - We envision that our graduates will positively impact the health of neonates through their leadership, research, and excellence in patient care. Mission - We have three missions: Patient Care: We will strive to improve the standard of practice and ensure the highest quality of care to neonates in our hospitals and around the world. We will care for neonates with the highest respect for their precious lives in a family -centered, compassionate, and caring environment, and utilizing evidence -based approaches to treatments that are regularly evaluated and updated. Research: We will pursue new knowledge through high -quality research that explores unanswered questions and tests and refines previously established ideas in developmental biology and neonatal -perinatal care. We will engage in world class clinical, translational, a nd basic science research, aimed at improving babies' lives throughout their lifespan. We will work collaboratively within and outside our institution in order to generate important discoveries that will enhance medical practice and inform the medical comm unity and the public of evidence -based approaches to neonatal -perinatal medicine. Education: We will impart knowledge, instill excitement for learning, and translate and refine questions into focused areas of research for our trainees. We will train futur e leaders in neonatal medicine, who will work in an academic or private setting and deliver the highest quality care to their patients. We will accomplish this by: o Allowing fellows to pursue their interests in a structured manner in order to produce quali ty research, addressing significant questions in neonatal -perinatal medicine. o Promoting a collegial environment that provides ample opportunity for fellows to grow and learn from their own and others' experiences. Research Activities The following are representative of various research activities occurring in the Division of Neonatal -Perin atal Medicine at UT Southwestern . The division held $1.4 million in direct funding in 2021 as of 8/22/2022 . This amount includes sponsored egrants and non -egrants data. Clinical Research NIH Neonatal Network for Clinical Trials: The Division of Neonatal - Perinatal Medicine is an active participant in the Neonatal N etwork clinical studies and has been since its inception in 1986 . Treatment of chorioamnionitis -exposed neonates: Several alternative diagnostic tests and therapies have been promoted for the neonate whose mother is diagnosed with chorioamnionitis. The faculty and fellows of the Division of Neonatal -Perinatal Medicine published 50 peer - reviewed papers in 202 1 Page | 11 Follow -up care for very low birth weight and high -risk infants, including neurodevelopment, chronic disease, and nutriti on is part of our ongoing study of these babies. Neonatal resuscitation: Randomized trials (e.g., temperature control, oxygen delivery, resuscitation educational interventions), observational studies (ETCO 2 guidance of CPR, effectiveness of epinephrine dosing), as well as other observational studies using the resuscitation database, which includes detailed information about all resuscitation team calls since 2003. Hypoxic -ischemic encephalopathy: Mechanism o f injury; assessment of tools such as the amplitude EEG; translational research utilizing a piglet model of offered by nursery: Late infants, hypoglycemia, transcutaneous bilirubin Observational studies using available databases: Several research studies and quality improvement projects use information fr om available databases, including: the neonatal resuscitation database (Parkland, see above), the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) databases at Parkland or Children's Medical Center (CMC), the NICHD Neonatal Research Network Databases (Generic Database, Follow -up Database, and Moderate Preterm Registry), the Vermont -Oxford Network (Parkland NICU) and the Child Health Neonatal Consortium Database (CMC NICU). Early evidence suggesting potential risk of metabolic syndrome in infancy among very low birth wei ght infants: Evidence for abnormal weight -to-length ratio, increased adiposity, glomerular hyperfiltration and high blood pressure in very low birth weight infants followed at the low-birth -weight clinic. Nutritional and growth studies: Optimizing Individ ual Nutrition in Preterm Very Low Birth Weight Infants: Randomized Clinical Trial comparing individualized versus optimized supplementation of human milk; Quality improvement in nutrient administration and linear growth assessment. Weaning CPAP in preterm infants: randomized study comparing two modes of weaning CPAP: from 5 cm vs. decreasing from 5 to 4 and 3 cm. Optimization of CPAP in the delivery room and decreasing CPAP failure in the NICU Less Invasive Surfactant Administration Laboratory Research Maternal and fetal cardiovascular physiology and development Animal models relating to neonatal resuscitation and gestational hypertension Pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia/chronic lung disease, and novel therapies Molecular basis of vasc ular disease Pulmonary endothelial function, nitric oxide, persistent pulmonary hypertension, and calcium metabolism The roles of h yaluronan ( hyaluronic acid) and its receptors in inflammation , endothelial function, and COVID -19 Gut microbiome and its effects on immune responses in the developing gut and risks for NEC Clinical Activities The Division of Neonatal -Perinatal Medicine has provided care for normal newborns and newborns with complex medical and surgical problems for more than 45 years. Faculty offer clinical services at four distinct institutions with a total of 18,000 -20,000 births and 250 NICU beds . Parkland Health and Hospital System Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: Since 1974, the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Parkland Memorial Hospital has been providing exceptional and comprehensive care to critically ill newborns. This was the first NICU in Dallas County and is the largest Level III unit in the region. The 96-bed unit averages ~1, 800 admissions annually, about 150 admissions a month. Our staff consists of a collaborative team of physicians, advanced practice providers , nurses and support staff who are all highly experienced in caring for a wide array of ne onatal disorders both medical and surgical. Working closely with our highly skilled colleagues in the maternal -fetal medicine department, we are able to provide exceptional care both before and after birth. This teamwork has resulted in some of the lowest mortality and morbidity rates in the country. This unit achieved Level III designation by the State in 2018 and again in 2021 . Page | 12 Newborn Nursery: With more than 12,000 deliveries a year, the newborn nursery at Parkland Hospital is one of the busiest in the country. Under the supervision of pediatric faculty from the Neonatal -Perinatal Division, pediatric residents and pediatric advanced practice providers provide comprehensive care for both term and near - term infants from birth through discharge. Labor and D elivery: We provide a unique and highly trained neonatal resuscitation team that attends more than 300 high -risk deliveries a month and have the capability to deliver cutting -edge delivery room care in even the most complex cases, including EXIT (Ex Utero Intrapartum Treatment) procedures. Under the direction of Myra Wyckoff, M.D., an internationally acclaimed physician in neonatal resuscitation research, the labor and delivery faculty provide a very unique resuscitation rotation for fellows, residents, and medical students, which includes exposure to a computerized patient simulator, participation in resuscitation research, review of the literature, and attendance at high -risk deliveries. Children's Health System of Texas Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: The NICU at Children's combines advanced technology with highly trained healthcare professionals to provide c omprehensive care for critically ill newborns. This state of the art, 47 -bed NICU opened in 200 7 as the premiere referral unit in North Texas. The NICU staff, under the supervision of faculty members from the Division of Neonatal -Perinatal, is experienced in caring for a wide -array of neonatal disorders, both medical and surgical. Through an integrated collaboration between Children's and an extensive network of pediatric subspecialists from UT Southwestern, this NICU is able to provide exceptional care tai lored to the specific needs of each individual patient , serving over 800 infants in 20 21. This NICU achieved Level IV designation by the State in 2016 and re -designation as a Level IV NICU in 2020. Thrive at Children's : The Thrive Clinic provides comprehensive medical and psychosocial treatment through intensive intervention, education, social services, and developmental testing for high -risk infants from birth to age five. The Fetal Evaluation and Treatment Alliance (FETAL) and The Fetal Center: Established in 2008, this program has grown substantially and culminated in the opening of a dedic ated Fetal Center in 2014. FETAL was the first program in North Texas offering a full continuum of specialized care for pregnant women diagnosed with a fetal anomaly. Patient families and their referring providers receive prenatal conferences with a highly specialized multidisciplinary team, all in one location, that brings the expertise of UTSW subspecialists to the affected baby at risk. A personalized approach addresses each in utero diagnosis to determine the best strategy for pregnancy, delivery and co ntinuity of care after birth. Receiving care through the FETAL Center provides access to maternal fetal medicine specialists, a world -renowned neonatal resuscitation team as well as a complete range of pediatric and surgical subspecialists who work togethe r to deliver the highest level of comprehensive care. TeleNICU: In 2013, in collaboration with Children's Health, we launched TeleNICU, the state's first dedicated neonatal telemedicine service and one of the most sophisticated systems of its kind in the US. TeleNICU links specially trained, board -certified UT Southwestern neonatologists at Children's Health to physicians at other hospitals' NICUs to consult and assist in the management of the sickest and most fragile infants. Using specialized equipment a nd secure broadband transmission, our dedicated neonatologists are able to communicate with doctors at other facilities, 24/7. Using two -way, real -time interactive communication, virtual examination of newborns at distant -site NICUs is achieved. Participat ing hospitals connect with UTSW neonatologists using a mobile equipment cart with medical -quality videoconferencing capabilities, secure data transfer, and digital equipment that permits diagnostic testing. Our physicians are able to use specialized camera s to perform high - definition visual examinations and a high -tech stethoscope to listen to the baby's heart , lungs and abdomen . Information Week named TeleNICU as one of the Elite 100 Information Technology Innovations in 2015. We have since established Tel eTransport , where our transport teams have telemedicine capabilities to allow neonatologists direct ability to examine and manage patients with the transport team , TeleFETAL, which allows fetal consultations to be done remotely , as well as TeleCooling for infants tha t have suffered HIE at outside hospitals. US News & World Report ranked the Neonatal Program at Children's Health in the top 50 of all programs in the United States in 202 1 Page | 13 William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital Level III NICU: The William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital features 30 single patient NICU rooms. State of the art neonatal care including mechanical ventilation bo th conventional and high frequency, inhaled nitric oxide therapy and outstanding nursing care are provided to fragile infants. Parents can sleep in the room overnight with their newborns - enabling parents to focus on their infant and build bonds that will help the baby grow stronger. This NICU received Level III designation from the State in 2018 and redesignation in 2021 . The quality improvement work in the unit has received several awards for innovation and excellent outcomes . Newborn Nursery : The Labor , Delivery and Recovery rooms combine modern technology with a warm, home -like environment to provide a safe and comfortable experience for mothers and families. Our highly experienced newborn physicians provide state -of-the-art care for the newborn infant. We also have lactation consultants to provide breastfeeding assistance. UT Southwestern is a member of the Texas Ten Step Program to improve maternity care practices. Policy development, education of staff, and provision of discharge resources for breastfeeding mothers are key initiatives of the program. Southwestern Health Resources - Texas Health Dallas ( Presbyterian ) Hospital (THD) The UT Southwestern Division of Neonatal -Perinatal Medicine assumed care of the newborn infants in the NICU and Spe cial Care Nursery at THD in September 2015, marking the beginning of Southwestern Health Resources, a close affiliation between UT Southwestern and Texas Health Resources. Level III NICU: Located on the third floor of the Margo Perot Center at Texas Health Dallas, a 47 -bed Level III NICU provides 24 -hour comprehensive care to premature, high -risk, and ill infants. The self -contained program offers therapies, equipment and an experienced multidisciplinary specialist team that includes UTSW neonatologists, medical subspecialists, and surgeons as well as excellent neonatal nurses, respiratory therapists, pharmacists and occupational therapists. This NICU received Level III designation from the State in 2018 and again in 2021 . Special Care Nursery: The Special C are Nursery provides specialized services and medical monitoring for infants who have graduated from the NICU but still require additional care. The nursery is staffed by board -certified UT Southwestern neonatologists who provide around -the-clock expert ca re for premature and special -needs infants. This 44 -bed nursery is the only Level II nursery in the Dallas area that offers private rooms. Parents are able to room with their infants in hotel -like surroundings that include a refrigerator, granite counterto ps, a flat -screen TV and a private bath, thereby encouraging parents to spend as much time with their babies as possible. Thrive at THD: As an extension of the T hrive program at Children's, T hrive at THD has skilled developmental specialists and pediatricians to provide comprehensive developmental testing for high -risk infants that have graduated from THD and surrounding NICUs. FETAL at THD: The Fetal Evaluation and Treatment Alliance (FETAL) provides fetal consultations at the Children's Health Specialty Center Park Cities located in the Margot Perot Center for Women & Infants at THD.
