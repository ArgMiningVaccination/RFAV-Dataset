Canadian G.S.T. number: Printed APRIL PharmTech.comGUEST EDITORIAL JORG GREUEL/PHOTODISC/GETTY IMAGESPharmTech.com/forum The pharmaceutical industry contin- ues to move ahead with its trajectory being tweaked by various outside forces. The highly regulated nature of our industry is a major contributor, while the need to do more with less continues to vex our everyday efforts. These factors are acutely realized when we congregate with fellow industry professionals at society and professional meetings. I use these interactions to explore the next big need for my clients as well as to craft a s t r a t e g y t h a t w i l l h e l p a d d r e s s t h e s e needs. INTERPHEX 2013, while being a continuation of the journey described by Bob Stewart last year, is also a realization of this \"group thinking\" fueled by cur-rent needs and pressures of our industry. It takes only a quick glance at the confer-ence agenda and list of exhibitors to fully appreciate this synergy. The customized conference content of INTERPHEX 2013 is the product of group thinking carried out in a struc-tured environment, which we refer to glibly as the advisory board. When you ask 15 industry professionals (the board) from across all sectors of our industry, you are guaranteed of get-ting valued input as well as things that are current and need to be addressed. The five conference tracks\u2014regulatory quality assurance/quality control, prod- uct development, facility and process design, manufacturing and packaging, and supply chain\u2014were pressure tested at INTERPHEX 2012 and have been leveraged effectively here for INTER-PHEX 2013. Several select topics will provide high value input for attendees. Current Development Best Practices for IR and MR Dosage Forms will be discussed by Glenn Van Buskirk and will touch upon aspects of the current effort to address the needed updates for FDA guidance in the area of post-approval changes. The industry has regularly used the Scale-Up and Post-Approval Change (SUPAC) guidances that were issued more than a decade ago. The widespread use of these guidances along with cur-rent industry need has brought about a rethinking in this area and will produce a work product that will be a reliable and time-proven asset. A keynote address, Reorganizing for the Future: Succeeding in the New Pharmaceutical Industry, will be given by Rajesh Nair from his perspective as president of Indegene. With a track re-cord of having worked and consulted for many firms, Indegene has assisted various companies as they navigate through strategies to become more agile as they bring products to market and leverage existing product lines through a successful lifecycle. A team from Duquesne University lead by Jim Drennen and Benoit Inge has assembled a must-see session that will take the attendee through a prac-tical utilization of aspects of quality by design as well as the application of key process control tools such as PAT. This will be followed by a panel discus-sion lead by Carl Anderson, also from Duquesne University. The panel will be case study-driven with experts from regulatory, development, quality, and the consulting sectors. The panelists will share their views as well as address must-have answers from attendees. Combination products along with information-rich case studies will be presented from leading medical de-vice manufacturers. David Armbruster from DePuy Synthes and Roy Fenni-more from Johnson & Johnson will walk the attendees through each of their sessions. David will discuss the aspects of product realization from concept through manufacture while Roy will detail technology transfer for design control of convergent products. A high priority has been placed on the \"meeting place\" that allows profes-sionals to gather and exchange ideas. As highlighted by Bob Stewart, \"there is a need to connect, face-to-face, in order to teach, to learn, to do business and to know each other better. Personal collaboration is critical to the industry INTERPHEX serves, and collaboration can begin with a conversation, with a meeting.\" INTERPHEX has established just such a meeting place and forum. The INTERPHEX team looks for- ward to meeting you at the Javits Center in New York City on April 23 -25, 2103. Let us know your thoughts, at any time. We intend to serve the industry and continue our mission to make INTER-PHEX the venue to learn it, hear it, see it, touch it, and procure it.

See us at INTERPHEX, Booth 345314 Pharmaceutical Technology APRIL 2013 PharmTech.comGUEST EDITORIAL JORG GREUEL/PHOTODISC/GETTY IMAGESPharmTech.com/forum In statehouses around the country, lawmakers are beginning to address the complexities of cutting-edge bio- tech drugs and the regulatory issues related to the interchangeability of biosimilar medicines. These legislative efforts represent a significant step in recognizing the important and complex role biologic medicines play in the fu-ture of healthcare and chronic disease management. They are also a necessary measure to ensure that patients and their physicians remain in control of their medical treatment decision-mak-ing as the market for complex biologics evolves over the next several years. Biosimilars are manufactured with the goal of closely mirroring the com-position and treatment profile of an in-novator biologic product, but are pro-duced without access to the innovator's proprietary manufacturing processes. Two biologics made using different cell lines and manufacturing processes will rarely, if ever, be exactly the same, hence the name \"biosimilar.\" Simply put, biosimilars are not generics, and those suggesting otherwise are incor-rect. Thus, current state laws governing the substitution of generics are not, and should not be, automatically applicable to biosimilars.Patients and physicians managing chronic conditions are generally aware of which treatments work best in their unique circumstances. Therefore, the decision to change to a biosimilar treat-ment is best made by doctor and pa-tient. However, at a minimum, provid-ing notice to the prescribing doctor and patient ensures everyone in the treat-ment continuum is informed of deci-sions to switch to a different biologic drug, either at the pharmacy level or due to insurance coverage guidelines. Until recently, there was no pathway for the development and approval of bi-osimilar products in the United States. The US Food and Drug Administration is currently developing such a pathway. Even after it is enacted, the policy on whether one biologic product may be substituted by dispensers when a differ-ent biologic product was prescribed will continue to be governed by state law. At present, most state laws need to be updated to address the commer-cialization and distribution of new biologic products and their biosimilar competitors, which are set to enter the marketplace over the next few years. Sound policy in each state outlining the parameters for safe substitution of interchangeable biologics is the best option to ensure patients have access to the most effective and appropriate treatments possible. Recognizing the authority US states have over biosimilar and interchangeable biologic medicines, Biotechnology Indus-try Organization (BIO) developed five principles on biologic substitution that we believe should be considered by all states when evaluating biosimilar legislation. Briefly stated, these principals are: t\u0001Substitution should occur only when FDA has designated a bio-logic product as interchangeable t\u0001The prescribing physician should be able to designate a prescription as not substitutable t\u0001The prescribing physician should be notified of the substitution if one occurs after the prescription is ordered t\u0001The patient, or the patient's au- thorized representative, should, at a minimum, be notified of the substitution t\u0001The pharmacist and the physician should keep records of the substi-tution. These principles strike the appro- priate balance of preserving the phy-sician-patient relationship, protecting patients, and promoting a competitive market for biologic therapies. We wel-come the opportunity to further dis-cuss this issue with lawmakers as they seek to address vital drug safety mea-sures that accompany this cutting-edge technology.

Tony Hitchcock, head of manufacturing at Cobra Biologics, spoke with Pharmaceutical Technology about trends and challenges of manu-facturing viral products in cell culture . PharmTech: With the approval of Novartis' mammalian cell-produced influenza vaccine in 2012, production methods for viral vaccines seem to be undergoing a shift from egg-based man-ufacturing to cell-based. What advances in recent years have enabled this transi-tion and what challenges still remain? Hitchcock: The production of viral vaccines has been performed in egg-based systems for many years, and it is clear that while significant develop-ments in the production of viral vec-tors from cell culture-based systems have advanced, many existing vac-cine products will continue to be pro-duced in this manner. For example, GlaxoSmithKline has just introduced a quadravalent flu vaccine from eggs, and Medimmune has invested signifi-cantly in the automation of eggbased processes at their UK facilities. These developments would indicate that for products, such as seasonal flu vaccine, existing production routes will be re-tained for the foreseeable future. For manufacturers of products such as flu vaccines, while significant in-vestment from national governments among others has been put in place to develop a cell-based production pro-cess to enable a response to pandemic flu, it is clear that egg-based processes are still sufficiently productive and cost effective to meet needs for sea-sonal demand. Combined with long-term safety profiles and in-place man-ufacturing capabilities, the drivers for adopting cell-based processes are not sufficient to justify their adoption. It is also clear that becasuse of the spe-cialist nature of eggbased production facilities, the majority of manufactur-ing will remain as an inhouse activity with limited opportunities for contract manufacturers in this field. In January 2013, however, FDA approved Protein Science Corpora-tion's Flublok vaccine, another non-egg-based influenza vaccine, which is potentially the sign of things to come. It will be interesting to see what the up the uptake of this product will be compared with the existing egg-based products, and how the large pharma companies respond to this. The real opportunities for the pro- duction of viral vectors from cell cul-turebased processes arguably lie with novel vaccine products, where there are no historical safety profiles in place. Other opportunities lie with products where eggbased systems are unsuitable, or where technical or product safety is-sues mean alternative approaches need to be sought to meet demands in terms of quantities of material or to achieve required levels of process robustness. PharmTech: What are the risks as- sociated with using cell-based manu-facturing for vaccines, and how are these risks typically addressed? Hitchcock : The potential risks with cell-based processes can be split into intrinsic and process-related. In terms of intrinsic risks, these will lie with the origin, purity, and design of the viral vector and producer cell line. Process-related risks will lie with the potential to introduce adventious agents/viruses into the process stream. Unlike the production of protein products from mammalian sources, it is clearly not possible to introduce validated viral in-activation or removal steps to mitigate these risks. Addressing these requires application of GMP principles and ap-proaches to development programs at a very early stage, focusing on the his-tory, purity, and stability of the viral vector. It is now commonplace for viral vectors to be rescued from syn-thesised plasmids, allowing for abso-lute traceability of the viral vector and full sequencing to be performed of the plasmids and resulting viral product. Stability studies can also be performed to demonstrate genetic stability of vec-tors at an early stage of development. With regards to producer cell lines, it is essential that the origins are known and that they are free from adventious agents and that generation of cell banks for both process development as well as GMP production works. Additionally, there is clearly a need for maintenance of segregation throughout develop-ment programs to prevent contamina-tion of viral stocks and cell banks.

In 2003, EMA set up a team to back activities in process analytical technology (PAT) in the EU. The agency has seen its PAT team as a ke y element in the implementation of QbD by encouraging process understanding. This knowledge becomes a basis for achieving quality by ensuring pre-defined quality criteria are met through design rather than ad-hoc testing. However, EMA has not been a strong driving force behind the adoption of QbD in the EU compared with FDA in the United States. Recently, both EMA and the EC have experienced pressure from the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in the biopharmaceutical sector, to do more to encourage QbD. In addition, EU authorities are becoming more concerned about the increasing number of quality defects in pharmaceutical manufacturing that have been causing a rise in drug scarcities. ICH guidelines The industry has been wanting to see greater use of the Q 8, Q9, and Q10 guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), which contain most of the basic QbD principles. These guidelines cover pharmaceutical development concepts in Q 8, quality risk management (QRM) in Q9, and a pharmaceutical quality system to be implemented in the different stages of a product lifecycle in Q10. The ICH guidelines offer pharmaceutical manufacturers the option of taking the \"minimal\" or traditional approach to qual ity assurance or an \"enhanced\" structured approach, which involves concepts like critical quality attributes (CQA), design space, and control strategies. The industry has been urging EU authorities to put more emphasis in regulations and guidelines on the enhanced attitude to quality, particularly because QbD is seen as a meansfor easing the regulatory burden with less need for inspections and post-approval submissions. EMA has, however, stressed that the adoption of an enhanced QbD approach by drug producers is optional rather than a requirement. In comments published last year on proposed changes yet to be finalized to EU regulations on approval of manufacturingvariations after marketing autho rization, pharmaceutical trade associations called for more accommodation of elements of the ICH guidelines in the legislation. EuropaBio, which represents both biotechnology companies and national associations in Europe, said in its comments, published in July 2012 on a proposed revised guideline on variations, that greater recognition should be given to an enhanced QbD approach. This approach would provide opportunities for \"a more science- and risk-based approach\" in assessing manufacturing changes. In a joint comment, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA),representing original drug producers, European Biopharmaceutical Enterprises (EBE) and European Vaccine Manufacturers (EVM), urged the EC to make clear in legal text that changes within a design space did not constitute variations that need to be approved. Design space is defined as a QbD component that sets the combination of variables and process parameters providing assurance of quality. The pharmaceutical industry in Europe sees QbD concepts as reflecting existing practices in the sector. Introducing them in regulations and guidelines gives more emphasis to the important elements in quality assurance. \"The adoption of ICH Q 8-10 is not introducing new requirements or expectations,\" says Julie Marechal-Jamil, senior manager of quality and regulatory affairs at the European Generic Medicines Association (EGA), Brussels. \"But the regulatory adoption of the guidelines is clarifying what elements are considered essential to support the pharmaceutical development section of a marketing authorization application dossier.\" Nonetheless, she claimed that \"many practical questions regarding implementation of QbD remain open\u2014even for medicines originators.\" The European Commission's latest revision of its GMP guide, effective from Jan. 31, 2012, shows the degree to which it is responding to calls for ICH guidelines to be given greater prominence in EU rules on quality in pharmaceuticals. Chapter 1 of the guide has been changed to align it with the concepts and terminology of the ICH Q10 guideline on pharmaceutical quality systems. It makes clear that this new chapter will also apply to two existing pieces of EU legislation on the principles and guidelines of GMP\u2014one, for medicines for human use, and other, for veterinary applications . References in the legislation to \"an effective quality-assurance system\" that manufacturers must establish and implement will now be taken to mean the ICH pharmaceutical quality system. \"For the purposes of this chapter, these terms can be considered to be interchangeable,\" states the revised guide. Greater recognition should be given to an enhanced QbD approach.Advancing QbD in the EU The European Union authorities are stepping up their efforts to incorporate quality-by-desig n principles into their regulations and guidelines.Sean Milmo is a freelance writer based in Essex, UK, seanmilmo@btconnect.com.Working Together to Perfect Y our Tableting Process There are a number of factors that can affect tablet quality, and failing to address them could cause serious production problems.

The biggest change in the GMP guide is a massive extension of Annex 2 on the manufacture of biological active substances, which has been extended from five to 32 pages and from 43 sub-items to 70. \"The enlargement has been necessitated by the introduction of new manufacturing technologies and the increased breadth of biological medicines into areas like gene and cell therapy,\" says the Commission. It is also because of the incorporation of components of the ICH guideline on QRM. \"These biological principles may display inherent variability,\" the new annex states. \"As a result, QRM principles are particularly important for this class of materials.\" The annex includes a new section on operating principles emphasizing the need for control strategies based on QRM principles to cover various key features of production processes. The GMP guide may have to be further updated to highlight the importance of certain aspects of ICH guidelines because of what EMA describes as \"public health crises\" due to disruption to drug supplies caused by manufacturing problems. In a discussion paper issued in late 2012, the agency pinpointed the need for tighter controls on outsourced manufacturing to ensure that it is GMP compliant. EMA also thought that details of the \"pre-planned inclusion of failsafe manufacturing site capacity\" should possibly be included in marketing authorizations. In the longer term, the agency is considering making some QbD elements mandatory rather than optional by requiring submissions by all marketing authorization holders of risk analyses of their manufacturing processes to identify weaknesses. Reducing drug shortages EMA is also looking to collaborate with other licensing agencies outside Europe on ways to reduce drug scarcities, including the sharing of information about product-supply issues. EMA is already involved in a joint program with FDA on the parallel assessment of marketing authorization and new drug applications, which include QbD approaches. One key objective of the three-year program, due to end in March next year, is to ensure consistency between the EU and the US in the implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, and Q10 guidelines. Assessments of applications are being done in parallel by the two agencies after which the review teams will discuss lessons to be learned and identify knowledge gaps. The pilot scheme should increase the momentum behind the uptake of QbD principles in Europe among both regulators and pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as lead to a more uniform policy between the EU and the US in the use of QbD to tackle issues like drug shortages due to production disruptions.

The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) has always been at the forefront of the harmonization of quality standards. Indeed, almost 50 years ago, the \"founding fathers\" of the Convention on the elaboration of a European pharmacopoeia had already identified the need to harmonize quality requirements for medicinal products on the European market. They also acknowledged the difficulties in retrospective harmonization and so decided to beginestablishing the Ph. Eur. by focusing on substances for which there were no existing standards in member states. The Convention was signed by eight countries in 1964 and, today has 38 signatory parties\u201437 states and the European Union. The success of this pan-European undertaking and its impact on a global scale is demonstrated by the 24 observers to the Convention, comprised of 23 countries from all around the world and the World Health Organization (WHO). The positive experience gained in prospective harmonization and the trust and mutual confidence developed between participants in the early years has, in the meantime, also been translated into retrospective harmonization. Today, topics that are of interestto more than one member state end up on the work program of the European Pharmacopoeia Commission, regardless of whether or not a national standard already exists. A changing industry Since the establishment of the European Pharmacopoeia in the 1960s, the world, and with it the pharmaceutical industry, has changed significantly. Int ernational harmonization among the three pharmacopoeias of Europe, Japan, and the United States (i.e., the three regions that started the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [ICH]) was, therefore, a logical development. Harmonization activities among the European, Japanese, and US pharmacopoeias began in 19 89 with the establishment of the Pharmacopoeial Discussion Group (PDG); an informal harmonization initiative between these pharmacopoeias parallel to ICH. In fact, it was a prerequisite for the ICH Steering Committee to agree on the elaboration of the ICH Guideline Q6A Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Dru g Substances and New Drug Products that the PDG committed to harmonizing the 11 general methods referred to in the document at that time and not to make unilateral changes once harmonization was complete. The ICH Q6A guideline includes a specific reference to the work of the PDG in chapter 2.8 \"Pharmacopoeial Tests and Acceptance Criteria.\" Where harmonization of general chapters is carried out, the aim is to arrive at interchangeable methods or requirements so that demonstration of compliance using a general chapter from one of the three pharmacopeias implies that the same result would be obtained using the general chapter of any of the other two PDG pharmacopeias. However, the activities of the PDG in harmonizing gene ral methods have not been limited to the Q6A methods; a wide range of general methods (35) has since been added to the work program. These include methods, such as chromatography, that are crucial for the quality control of medicines and a prerequisite for further harmonization of specific monographs. Besides the harmonization of general methods, the PDG has also been working on monographs for widely used excipients. Currently, 62 such excipients are included in its work program. Clearly, the purpose of harmonizing a monograph is to arrive at identical requirements for all attributes of the product inquestion. To date, 2 8 of the 35 general methods and 43 of the 62 excipient monographs have been harmonized. Detailed information on the work program of the PDG is published in Pharmeuropa and the respective forums of the other two PDG pharmacopeias. In addition, the Ph. Eur. contains a specific General Chapter 5. 8., Pharmacopoeial harmonization, that provides more information on the outcome of harmonization. This chapter was revised by the Ph.Eur. Commission in November 2012 to provide further support to users by highlighting information on any nonharmonized attributes/provisions and on any local requirements (i.e., attributes that are present only in the Ph. Eur. text). Non-harmonized attributes/provisions are placed between black diamonds \bzz in the corresponding Ph. Eur. texts, and the local requirements are marked by white diamonds ( 99).99 The PDG has often been criticized of slow progress. However, it has to be acknowledged that the three pharmacopeias have differing legal statuses; the Japanese Pharmacopoeia is part of the Japanese government's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare; the European Pharmacopoeia is part of the Council of Europe (an inter-governmental organization); while the US Pharmacopeia Convention (USP) is a private, not-for-profit organization that is independent The Need for Pharmacopeial Harmonization In the context of international trade, the need to develop global quality standards for medicines is increasing. The aim is to arrive at interchangeable methods or requirements. Susanne Keitel, PhD, is director of the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Healthcare. Pharmaceutical Technology APRIL 2013 37 of the US government. In addition, all three are embedded in their specific national/regional regulatory frameworks that, after more than 20 years of activity at the ICH level, are only partially harmonized. Harmonization of APIs In addition to PDG activities, Ph. Eur. and USP have initiated a bilateral pilot project on the prospective harmonization of monographs for APIs. So far, this project covers four substances that were still under patent at the time monograph elaboration was initiated and it has been run in close collaboration with two sponsors. All four monographs have now been adopted by the respective governing bodies of the Ph. Eur. and USP. Together with the sponsors, the two pharmacopeias have decided to extend the pilot phase to cover the revisions of these first four monographs to ensure a robust procedure is in place before a final decision is taken on the future process. In the meantime, the Japanese Pharmacopeia has also voiced its interest in participating in the project. Since the setting up of the PDG and ICH, the industrial environment has changed. It is evident that harmonization between the three ICH regions is no longer sufficient in today's world, where a high percentage of APIs come from outside Europe, Japan, and the US. Up to 80% of the volume of APIs used in the production of medicines for the European market come from India and China, with the cited figures varying depending on the source of data. The European Pharmacopoeia, therefore, is also actively involved in a number of other international harmonization projects; the most promising of which is the recent WHO initiative. Good pharmacopeial practices In early 2012, the WHO convened the pharmacopeias of the world for their first international meeting in Geneva. Representatives of 23 pharmacopeia secretariats from 21 countries, the EDQM/Council of Europe, and the WHO used the opportunity to exchange views on experiences, policies, and challenges. The discussions clearly identified the need to strengthen collaboration among pharmacopeias worldwide. Based on the experience and challenges with existing harmonization initiatives (such as the PDG) that focus on retrospective harmonization, it was acknowledged that new platforms open to all pharmacopeias who wished to participate would need to be identified for a global pharmacopeial harmonization process. However, any platform would need to respect that each pharmacopeia operates within a national or regional legal and regulatory 100% of the Fortune 500* pharmaceutical companies use TrackWise\u00ae for their quality and compliance needs.

Hence, the main emerging proposal has been the development of Good Pharmacopeial Practices ; a guidance document that would describe harmonized policies and approaches to monograph development, collaboration between pharmacopoeias, and interactions with stakeholders. Good pharmacopeial practices are intended to favor and facilitate future collaboration, work-sharing, and prospective harmonization between participating pharmacopeias. The WHO has been asked to facilitate the elaboration of these good pharmacopeial practices under the auspices of its Expert Committee on Specifications. An initial drafting group has been formed, comprising representatives from Argentina, Brazil, the Ph.Eur., India, Japan, Mexico, Russian Federation, Ukraine, and USP, with editorial assistance being provided by the United Kingdom. As a truly global initiative, the entire process will be open to all pharmacopeias. A follow-up meeting, organized jointly by the WHO and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale Pharmaceutique (FIP) in October 2012 in Amsterdam, gave the opportunity to the pharmacopeias to present this proposal to stakeholders and to collect feedback. As a consequence of this discussion, a second closed international meeting of world pharmacopeias is now planned to take place in India in April 2013, hosted by the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission and co-organized with the WHO. Preparation of a first draft of the Good Pharmacopoeial Practices guidance document as a basis for substantial discussions and progress at this meeting is well under way, with pharmacopeias from different continents sharing the work. The Ph. Eur. Commission supports these developments, which will help the pharmacopeias of the world to agree on harmonized, scientifically sound approaches and policies to ensure the quality of medicines for the benefit of patients around the world. PTThe WHO has been asked to facilitate the elaboration of these good pharmacopeial practices under the auspices of its Expert Committee on Specifications.

Preventing moisture from permeating through the packaging is an important function of the container-closure system used for medicines. Today, moisture uptake is a common cause of product package failures in the pharmaceutical industry\u2014and a topic that the US Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) is addressing with an upcoming revision to United States Pharmacopeia -National Formulary (yUSP-N F) General Chapter <671> Containers\u2014 Performance Testing for Plastic Containers. Updating General Chapter <671> Initially developed in the 1970s primarily for use by pharmacists dispensing medications into the familiar amber vial, General Chapter <671> has become heavily relied upon over the years by pharmaceutical manufacturers, packagers, repackagers, and FDA because it is referenced in the agency'sGuidance for Industry: Container Closure Systems for Packaging Human Drugs and Biologics . However, the general chapter has had only minor edits and additions in intervening years. Because it is being used beyond its original scope and utilizes an older permeation test, modi fications to the general chapter have become necessary. This effort is supported by industry, and the newly proposed standard builds on method development work completed over the past decade by the Product Quality Research Institute (PQRI). PQRI is a nonprofit consortium of organizations that conducts research to generate specific scientific information on issues of interest to FDA and to standards-setting organizations such as USP. One of the key ways the general chapter is being updated is through the proposal for a new moisture vapor transmission rate test method for solid oral-dosage forms. The current test method is a gravimetric method that is not very robust, which can lead to variation in test results. The proposed new method is also gravimetric, but is more reproducible and uses more rigorous environmental test conditions. Both the older and newly proposed methods measure weight gain over time. However, the information yielded by the new method will give end-users a more accurate assessment of how much protection their packaging is affording to the final product. ASTM standard The proposed general chapter, including the new method for calculating moisture vapor transition rate, aligns with the recently released ASTM International standard: \"ASTM D7709 -12 Standard Test Methods for Measuring Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR) of Pharmaceutical Bottles and Blisters.\" ASTM sets international voluntary consensus standards. The revised USP general chapter is included in Pharmacopeial Forum 39(2) March -April 2013, and USP invites comment on the proposal at www.usp.org/usp-nf/pharmacopeial-forum. Classification An underlying issue relevant to this activity is the USP classification system for packaging. At present, USP specifies the categories of \"well-closed\" and \"tight\" in its classification,with the latter used much more frequently. Certain medications, however, require packaging beyond \"tight\"\u2014requiring no moisture permeation. While no change to the classification system was included in the new proposal, USP would like to open a dialogue with regulators, manufacturers, contract packagers and repackagers, and other stakeholders about whether, and how, this classification system could be expanded. The classification system\u2014along with applications of the new <671> method, manufacturer case studies, current regulatory thinking from FDA, and other areas affected by the new method (e.g., desiccant choice, which is particularly important with the method change)\u2014will be among the important areas of discussion at a May 20 -21, 2013, workshop cosponsored by USP and PQRI in Rockville, MD. More information about this workshop is available at www.usp.org/meetings-courses/workshops/pharmaceutical-packaging-moisture-permeation. PTMoisture Permeation of Pharmaceutical Packaging USP is proposing a new performance testing standard for moisture permeation of pharmaceutical packaging.

See page 102 in this issue for USP's review of \"Fixed-Oil Excipient Monographs.\"See us at INTERPHEX, Booth 281742 Pharmaceutical Technology APRIL 2013 PharmTech.com It is essential that pharmaceutical manufacturers follow current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs) to ensure product quality and patient safety. FDA regularly inspects the manufacturing facilities of pharmaceutical companies to determine if GMPs are being followed. Pharmaceutical Technology spoke with By rian Hasselbalch, Acting Associate Director for Policy and Communication, Office of Manufacturing & Product Quality, Office of Compliance at FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Researc h, to find out what trends in GMP violations and quality issues the agency has discovered in the past year. Top GMP deficiencies PharmTech: What were some of the top GMP deficiencies in pharmaceutical manufacturing that FDA documented in 2012? Hasselbalch (FDA): FDA inspections of drug manufacturers are designed to always evaluate the facility's quality system. The quality system includes evaluation of manufacturing problems\u2014complaints, recalls, deviations, defects, and failures\u2014so it may not be surprising that we tend to find CGMP deficiencies in this area. Inspection findings from 2012 show CGMP deficiencies in the following major areas: t\u0001The quality unit does not function as the CGMP regulations require: Approving or rejecting procedures, major decisions about quality including batch release (21 CFR 211.22). t\u0001Production and process controls are not proven valid and/or are not in writing sufficient to assure consistent performance (21 CFR 211.100 ). t\u0001 Complaints, defects, and failures are not fully investigated to determine cause and/or full scope of impact (21 CFR211.192).R t\u0001Facility and equipment are not designed or maintained to assure cleanliness (sanitary surfaces and/or free of residual drug contamination) (21 CFR 211.67). Major trends PharmTech: What were the major trends in quality control violations in pharmaceutical manufacturing? Hasselbalch (FDA): There is a problem of oversight: the quality unit is not governing operations as required; management is not providing sufficient resources to quality assurance activities. In some cases, we see evidence that the quality unit is not being allowed to govern operations bearing on quality assurance, and batch release decisions are made contrary to the CGMP regulations. One area of change from past years to the more recent full year is that facility cleaning and equipment maintenance deficiencies have increased. FDA Warning Letters over the same period reveal problems particularly in sterile manufacturing operations, where the consequence of poor maintenance and cleaning often leads to more severe consequences for patient safety, such as production of a non-sterile injectable. Improvements in quality control PharmTech: What areas of quality control could pharmaceutical manufacturers improve upon? Hasselbalch (FDA): First, manufacturers should prevent problems from happening by providing sufficient resources toward the creation of a well-designed, optimized manufacturing and control operation. This may not be a novel concept, but is still worth saying. Second, manufacturers should react more aggressively on information bearing on product quality. All too often, we see potentially negativequality information\u2014such as consumer complaints, aberrant stability results, abnormal yield variations, adverse-eventreports\u2014being evaluated too slowly and incompletely. Weunderstand the need for a response to such in formation to be thoughtful, but we often see manufacturers summarily disregard such data. PharmTech: What areas have pharmaceutical companies improved upon in the past two years? Hasselbalch (FDA): Inspection deficiencies appear to have decreased in quality-unit responsib ilities (while still being higher than other types of deficiencies) and employee training. Domestic versus offshore PharmTech: What domestic manufacturing GMP deficiencies have FDA documented compared with offshore manufacturers? Hasselbalch (FDA): Domestic and offshore manufacturers tend to have similar problems; usually, given the greater number of APIs being made offshore than here in the US, the differences are often explained by the nature of the processing and stan dards expecte d. In fiscal year (FY) 2012, FDA performed approximately 500 preapproval-type inspections (specific to a site and application), which includes all types of application-listed facilities (API, finished product, processing, testing, and packaging). This is about the same number as in FY 2011. In FY 2012, FDA performed about 1900 CGMP-type inspections (i.e., routine coverage) of facilities connected with human drug manufacturing (except medical gas; including all other drug types and APIs as well as finished product) here in the US and offshore. This is about the same amount as in FY 2011, but with one big difference: routine CGMP inspections of offshore facilities increased by about 20% in FY 2012 over FY 2011. We have planned for this increase to continue in FY 2013. Other FY 2013 changes over previous years include increased inspections of positron emission tomography facilities, which are primarily domestic sites. PTTrends in GMP Violations FDA's Brian Hasselbalch provides an overview of trends found in FDA quality inspections over the past 2013 PharmTech.com GIORGIO FOCHESATO/GETTY IMAGES Report from: Thailand Jane Wan The Thai government is ramping up efforts to promote and develop the biotechnology sector in a bid to enhance its global competitiveness. Thailand's biotechnology sector was given a boost when the drafting committee for the National Social and Economic Development Plan No. 11 decided to include it as part of the national plan for 2012 to 2016. The initiative received strong support from researchers, scholars, and related sectors considering the slow development of the biotech sector in Thailand, and also because such technology development will contribute to the country's economic growth. Thailand's forte is in agriculture and food biotech followed by medical technology, says Hannah Nawi, associate director for healthcare of Frost and Sullivan. Seventy percent of R&D expenditure is being channeled to agricultural biotechnology. According to Nawi, the average export of agricultural and food products is valued at $23 billion. Slow growth in biotechnology The development of the biotech sector has, however, been slow in Thailand compared to Singapore and Malaysia. Last November, Malaysia attracted a total of $4.2 billion in biotech investment, exceeding the $2.9-billion target for its Phase ll plan under the National Biotechnology Policy. Phase II focuses on biotechnology sub-sectors including drug discovery, new product development, technology acquisition, and licensing. Malaysia has consequently raised its 2015 investment target to US$ 8.5 billion. Singapore's biomedical sector, on the other hand, is already accounting for 5% of its economy. In 2010 alone, the country generated $7.5 billion compared to Thailand's $167 million. \"Thailand's biotechnology sector is hampered by the lack of scientific professionals, technol ogical skills, and government support, although it appears that there is a strategic framework in place. Moreover, the key downside risk to biotechnology investment is the long incubation period. The risk of failure is high and investors' confidence is typically tied to the probability of success,\" commented Cher Boon Piang, analyst of Business Monitor International (Asia). Nevertheless, the current outlook has not discouraged the Thai government from increasing its support and involvement in the sector. Over the years, agencies such as Thailand Board of Investment (BOI) and National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (BIOTEC) have been playing a proactive role in developing Thailand's biotech sector. When BOI started promoting biotechnology in 2007, it came up with an eight-year corporate tax exemption and tariffs waiver on imported machinery. It also granted incentives to projects. In 200 8, eight new projects worth $9 million received the thumbs-up for such benefits. BIOTEC, on the other hand, channelled approximately $21 million to R&D activities in 2011. It collaborated with Novartis on a project to investigate the potential use of microorganisms and natural compounds as sources of new medicines to treat diseases such as cancer and tropical illnesses. Besides that, it assisted the Thai-based environmental and research company, Hi-Grimm, to launch KEEEN in 2010. KEEEN is an environmentally friendly bioremediation agent that uses microorganisms to eliminate hydrocarbons, fats, grease, and organic substances from contaminated areas. Hi-Grimm is currently producing and commercializing the final product. Investing in biotechnology Thailand is also building up its talent base, which is necessary for the sector's growth. On a yearly basis, it is producing 800 to 900 undergraduates pursuing a biotech degree, 300 to 400 individuals with Master's degrees, and 50 with doctorates across its 24 universities. Key statistics from BIOTEC show that of the 570 workers employed in the biotech sector, 539 are graduates, or postgraduates, and 472 are R&D scientific staffs. From a business perspective, Thailand has approximately 200 biotech companies Birgit Breitmoser Technical drafts woman (Machine Engineering)\"Imperfections? I like them in people.

The Thailand Science Park, a world-class facility, houses more than 1600 full-time researchers. Its attractive features include long-term land leases for construction and ready-made wet laboratories for rent. In February 2012, the Thai minister of public health expressed support for the Government Pharmaceutical Organization who is in the process of building a manufacturing facility for biotech and non-biotech products. Helen Featherstone, general manager of IMS Health Thailand, says: \"In my opinion, Thailand's biotech sector will only start to develop within the next 10 years. Since the supply of these products will remain within the country's perimeters, foreign companies are likely to continue importing biotech products from other countries. On the other hand, local players are facing issues including governmental policy changes, increases in minimum wage, and pressure on pricing.\" All is not lost for Thailand's biotech sector, although it is not likely to compete with Singapore and Malaysia given its current developmental stage. Cher says, \"Thailand should find some niche sub-sectors to invest in. It has seen some success in microbial-based research so far and should look further into it given the high burden of tropical diseases in the country and its neighboring ones including Myanmar, Cambodia, and Vietnam.\" Nawi adds, \"Further development of the medical biotech sector lies in the country's competitive edge as a provider of clinical trials. Thailand offers fast patient enrollment with lower dropout rates, higher patient concentration per trial site, and a less expensive workforce to conduct the trials. It also has a well-developed hospital system to conduct the trials. Looking forward, we are likely to see interesting changes and developments in the coming years. But the government has to ensure that conductive policies and regulations are implemented to support the potential growth of the country.\" PT \u2014Jane Wan is a freelance writer based in Singapore.IMPORTANT FACTS t\u0001Under Thailand's first National Biotechnology Policy Framework (2004 to 2009), 90 new companies were formed, bringing the number of biotech companies to an estimated total of 170. t\u0001Thailand has succeeded in producing the world's first commercial biosensor for avian influenza.

The Russian pharmaceutical market has been extensively developing over the past decade, largely influenced by foreign investments in this area of the country's economy. It is currently one of the top 10 largest pharmaceutical markets in the world. At the same time, the Russian pharma market has witnessed stricter state regulation of pharmaceutical activity, generally defined as a certain restraining measure over uncontrolled pharma market growth. The escalation of state control within the industry has been especially noticeable during the past two years. A major factor influencing the Russian pharma market is the initiative to bring its regulation to compliance with international standards. Many experts link this initiative to Russia joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Aug. 22, 2012. This date has marked yet another stage of Russia's integration into the world economy and as of that day, Russia has become a full member of WTO. Consequently, there has been extensive changes in legal regulation for the pharmaceutical industry in 2012, namely in the areas of technical regulation, customs law, licensing requirements, relations of pharmaceutical companies with medical officials, competition, and advertising law. Customs Customs regulations for pharmaceutical drug import will change now that Russia has become part of WTO. In accordance with WTO's protocol on accession import customs, duty rates for drugs will gradually decrease from the current 10-15% to 5-6.5%; however, the process is long term and will not be completed until 2016. This gradual reduction of import duties for foreign drugs will not likely induce a noticeable price decline for end customers because the final cost will depend on the distributors as well as pharmacy extra charges. However, it is possible that there will be a reduction in price for expensive drugs, and Russian drug manufacturers are afraid that their market position may be weakened as a result of the decrease in price of imported me dicines. Also, by joining WTO, Russian drugs can gain access into the international market due to the uniform rules followed by other WTO members in relation to Russian pharmaceutical products. Eliminating discrepancy Russia's WTO membership is also associated with obligatory implementation of international GMP standards in drugs manufacturing. The legal development in this area has not been extensive in 2012, but because of the necessity to bring drug quality in accordance with int ernational standards, work on amending statutory basis in this field was initiated long before Russia's accession to WTO. Rules on manufacturing and control of drug quality, made on the basis of EU GMP, were enforced on Jan. 1, 2010. International standards for the manufacture of drugs will be gradually impl emented through the transition period of Russia entering WTO. The production of drugs in compliance with international standards has already begun and its completion is planned at the end of 2013. Escalation of state control Governmental control (i.e., stricter governmental industry internal regulations) remains a sig nificant trend that relates to the new licensing requirements, more specified regulation of Vadim Konyushkevich is a senior associate, VKonyushkevich@ lidings.com, and , is an Moscow.\u00a92012 Parker Hannin Corporation FER-1-1 www.parker.com/pharmaTogether, we can lter out fermentation risk.

Firstly, tightening of licensing requirements should be noted. On Jan. 1, 2012, a new Decree on the licensing of pharmaceutical activity came into effect, which introduced a detailed list of licensable activities as well as new requirements for licensing drug transportation (1, 2). New rules on information disclosure in the course of clinical studies of medicines have been established as amendments in the federal law on \"circulation of drugs\" (3). The rule sets forth nondisclosure without prior consent of the results of preclinical and clinical studies provided for medicines registration. It is proclaimed to divulge any of this information within six years since the date of registration. Violation of this regulation incurs administrative and penal liabilities. Regulating relations of medical officials The year 2012 has also signalized a strengthening of regulation in the area of medical and pharmaceutical employees' relations. In particular, from January 2012, new wording of the federal law on \"fundamental healthcare principles in the Russian Federation\" (Law No. 323-FZ) has been enforced (4). Article 74 of this law sets a number of restrictions on the relations of medical officials with representatives of pharmaceutical organizations. The policy amendment is that medical officials cannot receive any gifts or money from pharmaceutical organizations apart from consideration for agreements relating to clinical trials or implementation of educational activity. Healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical representatives cannot receive any gifts from the manufacturing company or pass drug samples to patients. In addition, it is prohibited to give out prescriptions on prescription forms containing any kind of advertising information or typed-in names of medicines. Doctors can only admit representatives of pharmaceutical companies, manufacturers or sellers of medicines in connection with the conduct of clinical trials or qualification trainings of medical officers. Any form of agreements that involve proposing certain categories of drugs or medical products to patients must be proclaimed. Fu rther amendments are currently under review to introduce even stricter administrative liability for violations of abovementioned provisions. New public control procedure One of the latest developments in the Russian pharma legislation is the adoption of new government control procedures over medicines. On Nov. 12, 2012, Decree No. 1152 of the government of the Russian Federation affirmed regulations on quality and security of public control procedures over medical activity. These regulations provide more details on the means of public control over the industry. Public control is to be conducted by means of scheduled routine inspections and random check-ups and/or on-site audit. A list of control measures has been set out for each kind of inspection taking place within the framework of public control relating to the quality and safety of the medical activity. These regulations provide for extreme forms of state control such as rights for official representatives to have full and unimpeded access to the territory or premises of the organizations under inspection, including the equipment and vehicles used. Representatives will also be able to copy any documents deemed to be necessary, conduct trials and examination, as well as apply precautionary and restrictive measures. FAS against deemed violation of competition legislation The Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) in association with the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation developed in October 2012 a new draft of governmental regulations in accordance with provisions of the federal law on \"allocation of orders for supply of goods, execution of works, and rendering of contin. on page 137 As a Director of Quality Control I adhere to a strict set of standards established to identify, measure, control and sustain the highest level of pharmaceutical product quality.

Sackman Latin America's diverse growing market seeks regulatory harmonization. Latin America is one of the top emerging markets in the bio/pharmaceutical industry. This region shows a great deal of diversity in its approach to pharmaceutical products as a result of differences in economics, resources, access to care, and definition of regulatory requirements by country. Common guidelines from groups like the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), part of the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Mercado Com\u00fan del Sur (Mercosur), a lead trade organization, are just beginning to be implemented. There's interest in greater harmonization, like Eastern Europe, across the region, but there still remains great divergence between individual countries. With its population reaching 600 million people in 2011, Latin America is a fast growing region with equally fast growing economies. The top four Latin American economies and pharmaceutical markets account for more than 60% of the total population: Brazil (194 million), Mexico (115 million), Colombia (46 million), and Argentina (41 million). Other major players include Chile, Peru, and Venezuela (1). Latin American pharmaceutical sales in 2011 were at $62.9 billion, registering 8.9% growth in 2012. This is particularly significant when considered within the context of global sales of $995 billion in 2011. The diversity of the region, however, presents some challenges. In addition to the fact that guidelines from PAHO and Mercosur are just beginning to be implemented, it's also worth noting that what exists are just guidelines, subject to regional and country specific variations. Other differences (e.g., economic differences, population differences, political differences) have profound implications for the pharmaceutical marketplace in Latin America. Key regulatory considerations The primary regulatory consideration across the Latin American region for pharmaceutical companies is the increasing trend toward standardized regulations. Each of the seven major markets has adopted regulations that are based on Mercosur or PAHO's recommendations. For example, Brazil revised its GMP standards in 2010 to ensure greater consistency with Mercosur/PAHO recommendations. Updates to Brazil 's GMPs addressed the areas of quality, sanitation, hygiene, qualif ication and validation, contracts, and computer system validation. Since then, Brazil has been moving ahead with implementation, includ ing the release of a guidebook for inspections in May 2012. In other cases, such as Mexico, international agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement protect foreign companies interested in expanding their business into the region. The Mexican federal commission for sanitary risk (COFEPRIS) also holds equivalence agreements with Health Canada and FDA for the regulation of drugs and medical devices. Additionally, in September 2012, COFEPRIS and the Chilean Public Health Institute signed a cooperation agreement that will allow for the harmonization of regulatory requirements within the Americas region, breaking the entry barrier present in many countries. The agreement, which is still at the \"memorandum of understanding\" (MOU) stage, is a bilateral mechanism that is eventually expected to allow the mutual recognition of marketing authorizations, inspection visits, and GMP certification. Mexico has also signed Jill E. Sackman, DVM, PhD, is a senior consultant at Numerof & Associates, Inc. (NAI), St. Louis, MO, www.nai-consulting.com. Pharmaceutical Technology APRIL 2013 53 other equivalence MOUs with El Salvador and Ecuador, and a MOU is in the making with Colombia. MOUs with Brazil and Argentina are expected in the near future. Even with all of these agreements, there is no Latin American equivalent of the European Medicines Agency\u2014no common body with the power to facilitate greater consistency across countries. Mercosur and PAHO can make recommendations, but cannot enforce a common set of rules the way a common governing body can. And to complicate matters, even as countries implement regulations to be more aligned with Mercosur and PAHO recommendations, they may not implement the same regulations at the same time. Despite the many efforts carried out by the major Latin American markets, the road toward total harmonization is steep. The main reasons are the size of the region and the number of countries included in the area, each of them with their own regulatory system, political background, and policy approach to healthcare and pharmaceuticals. One proposal has been that of convergence rather than harmonization similar to what is in use in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Area (APEC). Regulatory convergence is a voluntary process in which the countries in question agree to work toward regulatory requirements that are similar, but not fully harmonized. Harmonization would require changing laws in each country and is, therefore, more difficult to achieve. Convergence of regulations is considered as the most viable solution for the Latin American region.Other considerations for pharmaceutical companies interested in expanding in Latin America inclu de regulatory risk profile. In general, Latin American pharmacovigilance systems have developed considerably since the early 1990s and continue to strengthen. Several countries have set up adverse events reporting systems for products in the market, and 10 countries have regulations reporting adverse events during clinical trials. Countries that currently have low pharmacovigilance requirement levels must still develop a system and appropriate monitoring measures. They are strongly encouraged by the WHO to do so in a timely fashion. The Subregional Pharmacovigilance Programmme and the Pan American Network for Drug Regulatory Harmonization also assist countries in Latin America in developing pharmacovigilance regulations that are harmonized with other Latin American countries. Product reimbursement The way that payment is structured varies tremendously. For example, in Mexico, the government pays for approximately 45% of healthcare\u2014significantly less than other Latin American countries. Other markets in the region, particularly Venezuela and Chile, have implemented Latin American social medicine (LASM) practices. In Venezuela, these practices have manifested as Mission Barrio Adentro, a national social welfare program comprised of neighborhood healthcare clinics built in the past decade intended to provide universal primary care to Venezuelans. Though both WHO wmpg.com 800-282-8823 Filling flexibility APRIL 2013 PharmTech.com and UNICEF have praised the program for its holistic approach to community health, critics have argued that building the planned 8500 local clinics siphons resources away from traditional hospitals. It's crucial that pharmaceutical companies understand how healthcare is delivered in each Latin American market, because there is such a degree of diversity. How payment is structured and care is delivered impact the number of stakeholders to whom companies have to present the case for their products. Key market considerations Beyond understanding the regulatory landscape of each market, there are other market characteristics to consider as well. For example, in some markets like Argentina, the majority of pharmaceutical sales are currently going to domestic companies. Chile, on the other hand, only produces a small amount of medical equipment locally, though some pr otectionist regulation meant to encourage local industry complicates the landscape for companies looking to expand there. Some countries, such as Colombia, produce pharmaceuticals that are imported by other countries in the region, especially Venezuela. Beyond the current makeup of the pharmaceutical industry in each nation, understanding the demographics and political landscape of each market is essential. Chile, for example, while smaller in market size than Brazil or Argentina, has the highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in Latin America. In May 2010, Chile became the first South American country to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Mexican market offers some other demographics that make it attractive for healthcare. The population has continued to grow by nearly 9% between 2005 and 2010, at the same time that life expectancy also increased. In addition, the Mexican government has, in the past decade, launched programs aimed at expanding health insurance. In 2003, the government started Seguro Popular , which offered publicly provided health insurance to some poor families. In the years since, Mexico has launched other initiatives, including Medical Insurance for a New Generation aimed at disadvantaged children under the age of five, and Universal Care Coverage for Pregnant Women in 2009. Health spending is still lower than the OECD average, but coverage has increased. The existing infrastructure must be kept in consideration. Mexico has a considerable manufacturing industry, but its research and development sector is less developed. Mexico spent $6.4 billion, or 0.4% of its GDP, in R&D across all sectors in 2011. As a percentage of GDP, this is less than half as much as Brazil spent the same year, and less than a quarter of the OECD average (2, 3).

Moving Forward in Latin America As a developing market, Latin America is quite complicated and diverse in terms of regulatory, reimbursement, market, demographic, and political characteristics. As regulatory trends converge and the market continues to grow, the region represents a substantial opportunity for pharmaceutical companies, especially those that take the time to understand these characteristics and anticipate the direction each market will take.

PAT and QbD principles both empha- size the need for process and material un-derstanding as a basis for effective control of the process. \"This emphasis has stimu-lated the industry to focus on how to get the information it really needs, which is leading to a productive re-examination of the existing analytical toolkit and an em-bracing of newer technologies that deliver the goods,\" says Tim Freeman, managing director for Freeman Technology. Prog-ress has also been made in integrating PAT into continuous manufacturing of finished-drug products, with the eventual goals of closed-loop control and real-time product release. PAT Online PAT is successfully being used to optimize individual unit operations in solid-dosage manufacturing by mon-itoring on-line critical quality attributes (CQAs). Data from PAT give manufac-turers better understanding and can be used to control the unit operation. Moisture content, for example, is used to determine the endpoint of a drying cycle. In tableting, the most common online measurements are near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, which measures moisture content and blend uniformity, and laser-diffraction particle sizing. Bulk-powder characterization tech- niques, which are performed at-line or in the laboratory, also fulfill the purpose of PAT by providing crucial information in a timely manner. \"Precisely quantifying the flow behavior of powders, either as raw materials or as a blend, and other charac-teristics such as the ease with which a pow-der entrains and releases air, supports the development of more efficient processes,\" explains Freeman. Flow-property mea-surements are increasingly being recog-nized as a desirable online measurement, but this technology is not yet available. Continuous solid-dosage manufacturing PAT can be used in continuous solid-dosage manufacturing, in which indi-vidual batch-processing units are con-nected in one process train. Advantages of continuous manufacturing include a smaller equipment footprint, production volume flexibility, and higher production efficiency, in addition to the potential for improved quality and process stability as a result of employing PAT. Continuous pro-cessing also allows more efficient process development. Because parameter-change effects can be measured in nearly real-time using a continuous setup, dozens of con-ditions can be tested in hours rather than days or weeks, notes Douglas Hausner, as-sociate director for industrial relations and business development at the Engineering Research Center for Structured Organic Particulate Systems (C-SOPS), which is based at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. In most cases, the same equip-ment used in the development stage can be used in production, which eliminates the need for scale-up. Although most solid-dosage processes today operate as a series of independent unit operations, pilot programs for contin-uous processing have made progress, and commercial implementation could occur within the coming year. The design of a continuous direct-compaction line built at C-SOPS, for example, was recently used to construct a commercial line at Janssen, which will be filed for FDA approval. GEA Pharma System's ConsiGma continuous manufacturing platform is an example of a commercially available continuous-manufacturing system. It can incorporate several different continuous technologies for the production of solid-dosage forms, such as wet granulation, dry granulation, and direct compression. The ConsiGma wet-granulation line consists of a blender, twin-screw granulator, fluid-bed dryer, granule conditioning unit, rotary tablet press, and continuous coater. This new generation of continuous manufac-turing technology minimizes start-up and shut-down material losses because steady state can be reached quickly, notes Kris Schoeters, product manager for continu-ous processing at GEA Pharma Systems. PAT plays a crucial role in the GEA sys-tem. In the granulator, online optical sys-tems are used to measure CQAs. Moisture content and blend uniformity are mea-sured using NIR. Particle size is measured using an online laser-diffraction system, Process Analytical Technology and Process Control in Solid-Dosage Manufacturing Jennifer Markarian FOTOSEARCH/ERIKO KOGA/COMSTOCK/GETTY IMAGES; DAN WARD Cover Story: Solid-dosage Manufacturing Industry is moving toward closed-loop control of continuous processing. Pharmaceutical Technology APRIL 2013 57FIGURES ARE COURTESY OF GEA PHARMA SYSTEMSand tablet-content uniformity is mea- sured using Fourier Transform (FT)-NIR transmission spectroscopy. Measurement data feeds into a process-control system to reach the goal of closed-loop control. Sampling challenges Incorporating PAT into a continuous pro-cess for solid-dosage drug production has not been a simple task, however. One chal-lenge has been retrofitting the equipment to enable collection of the correct data from PAT devices. Some measurements (e.g., flow, pressure, and temperature) are readily available from inline sensors. Other measurements, such as online NIR spectrometry, are more complex and have required creativity in the physical interface with processing equipment. Enabling the sensor to collect good data, for example, has often required that probes and win-dows be retrospectively engineered into the processing equipment. \"NIR is a reflectance measurement that measures whatever is sampled by the probe. If a sample is stuck to the probe lens, it will be measured repeatedly,\" notes Hausner. The C-SOPS line incorporates a window for the NIR measurement in the transfer pipe directly above the tablet press to measure blend content as close as possible to the tablet press. C-SOPS researchers investigated several different designs of modifying the pipe leading into the tablet press. The researchers con-cluded that plug-flow without turbulence was crucial to minimizing noise and al-lowing the analysis to run quickly. GEA Pharma's self-cleaning Lighthouse Probe, developed with J&M Analytik, was designed as a solution to the problem of sample adhering to the lens (see Figure 1 ). The viewing windows can be cleaned dur-ing the process, and a self-calibration fea-ture indicates if a window is contaminated. Work at Pfizer included developing solutions for sampling, such as screw transfer devices that enable sampling points to be inserted in flowing powders and developing heated probes to avoid material sticking, notes Steve Hammond, senior director and team leader of Pfizer's Process Analytical Sciences Group. Pfizer also conducted experiments to determine reflective properties of powders, depth of Figure 1: An in-process optical probe enables process analytical technology (Lighthouse Probe, GEA Pharma Systems). mgamerica.com 866-962-3090 Designed for R&D, lab, clinical trials, small batches and special productions Can handle several dosing units simultaneously, enabling multiple product combinations in one capsule Up to 3,000 capsules/hour Continuous or intermittent motion Self-contained 100% Net weight check available The ultra-flexible CAPSULE FILLER designed for R&D and lab-based operation The FlexaLab R&D Capsule Filler See us at Interphex Booth #225 358 Pharmaceutical Technology APRIL 2013 PharmTech.comCover Story: Solid-dosage Manufacturing penetration, and return of radiation in loose and compressed powders. Other as-pects of sampling, such as mass of material contributing to a measurement, integra-tion times for scanning, and the effect of reference scanning had to be extensively studied and understood, adds Hammond. Integrating PAT and process control The next step after integrating PAT into the continuous process as a monitoring tool is to incorporate the data from PAT into process control. In a feed-forward/feed-backward or closed-loop control system, critical process parameters (CPPs) are dy-namically adapted and fed to the controller to keep the process within specification. In today's batch processes, unit operations are operated as \"islands of automation,\" but the goal of continuous processing is to control multiple, single units as one unit by using an overarching process-control system.Closed-loop control has been used suc- cessfully for many years in other process industries. \"The frightening part for the pharmaceutical industry is moving from manual control with people making de-cisions to advanced process control, in which process data and modeling soft-ware automatically control the process,\" comments Jonathon Thompson, senior manager of Compliance Services Con-sulting at Invensys. \"PAT can give you a lot of data, which you need to turn into information about the process and whether it is within the CQA param-eters,\" he explains. \"Process-modeling software compares real-time data to an ideal or 'golden' batch profile, identifies what parameters need to be changed to meet the ideal, and feeds this back into the control system.\" Researchers have been addressing several issues while integrating process control. One issue is that although some process equipment (e.g., newer feeders) is typically already instrumented for control, other equipment may require retrofitting. The tubular blender used at C-SOPS, for example, had a simple motor with a tachometer to control the speed, and C-SOPS engineers added instrumen-tation to allow more sophisticated control of the blender speed. Integration of instrument software with plant equipment is a challenge. Some installations that require simple endpoint or on/off control could use simple, analog 4-20 mA connections, says Hammond, but the most valuable applications gen-erally require more sophisticated control that involves developing either direct communication with the manufacturing equipment's control systems or commu-nication with plant supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. \"Ten years ago these communication links were custom developed for each piece of equipment. In recent years the develop-ment of \"open architecture\" software has simplified this aspect of instrument in-tegration,\" explains Hammond. Open-architecture software (e.g., OPC) uses open standards that enable connectivity. This software meets the need for com-munication protocols to enable analytical instruments to communicate with control Qualicaps\u00ae Equipment Innovation is Captivating Featuring the CWI-90 Capsule Technology APRIL 2013 59systems, says Hammond, who notes that, after working with instrument vendors and control-system companies over the past five years, most of Pfizer's vendors' instruments now communicate via OPC. Another challenge has been ensur- ing that data from PAT flows into the process-control system quickly enough to enable meaningful control of pro-cess fluctuations to keep CQAs within specification. \"If the measurement takes longer than the residence time of the material\u2014for example, 30-45 seconds of residence time in the blender\u2014then the measurement can not be used for process control,\" explains Hausner. He says that available NIR instruments are adequate for some applications, but faster analysis may be needed for other appli-cations, such as smaller doses or lower percentages of API, which would neces-sitate more scans to obtain a measure-ment. C-SOPS continues to investigate solutions for NIR measurement in its production-scale Continuous Pharma-Figure 2: A continuous, high-shear granulation and drying system in operation at the GEA test center (ConsiGma, GEA Pharma Systems). mgamerica.com 866-962-3090The CARTONER that re-defines \"user Patented carton pick-up and positive opening systems Fully GMP-compliant Balcony design for accessibility, easy cleaning and reduced contamination Smooth product handling via servo-motors and electronic cams The Romaco us Booth #225 360 Pharmaceutical Technology APRIL 2013 PharmTech.comceutical Advanced Manufacturing Laboratory (CpAML). Analysis costs are part of the equation, notes Hausner. For example, a current CpAML project is comparing the use of one, fast (i.e., expensive) spectrometer with an array of slower but more economical spectrometers. An alternative method is inferential sensing, in which offline laboratory data is used with known correlations to give the control system the data it needs, adds Thompson. Tracking material flow through the system is a crucial aspect of process control. A SCADA system tracks the lo-cation of a \"product plug\" as it moves through the process and adds this context to the PAT data in the process-control modeling software, explains Ivo Backx, manager of business and project development for the pharmaceutical industry at Siemens Industry Automation Division. \"In tablet produc-tion, for example, multiple variables control the CQAs and you need to know what these attributes are and the correla-tion between them at specific points in the process,\" says Backx. \"For example, you need to know that the material in the tablet press now had a certain content uniformity at the blender.\" Material tracking through the system is linked to requirements for traceability, notes Backx. Traceability is simple in a batch system because it is as- sumed that all the product from one batch is the same. \"For a continuous operation, traceability becomes much more important because not all the product is submitted to the same process at the same time. Using a first-in/first-out (FIFO) principle is, therefore, very important,\" says Schoeters, who notes that GEA has adapted the unit opera-tions of mixing, granulation, drying, compression, and coat-ing in such a way that the product is traceable throughout the production line and back-mixing is limited as much as possible. The ConsiGma system, such as the line shown in Figure 2 , continuously monitors CPPs to keep them in con- trol and maintain product quality. This includes measure-ments using PAT (e.g., particle size, moisture, uniformity), but primarily involves monitoring of and control-feedback loops on machine parameters. Torque of the granulator screws, for example, is continuously monitored, and a de-viation from the set value triggers actions and alarms. Other challenges High equipment costs and restrictions on capital spending are currently barriers to implementing PAT and continu-ous processing technologies. In addition, revised Euro-pean regulatory guidance requires refiling of NIR instru-ments after calibration updates (3). \"This new guidance on NIR is very restrictive. It does not allow for changes in raw materials, instrument maintenance, and all the rou-tine occurrences that require calibration maintenance,\" notes Hammond. Real-time release Although real-time release (RTR) is a goal for industry and for regulators, only a few companies have achieved it Experience makes a world of difference.

In RTR, prod- uct quality assurance is based on online analysis, and the product is released as it is produced rather than a batch being held while waiting for quality-control testing. RTR could be implemented for batch processing, in that a batch could be released if there were no deviations throughout the batch. In continuous processing, product could be released continually given no deviations. The-oretically, online measurement would identify out-of-specification product and allow it to be segregated or even identify a change in CQAs before the product goes out of specification (4). A new program, Accelerating Inno- vative Research (AIR), builds on the C-SOPS infrastructure at Rutgers and is focused on working with existing PAT as well as partnering with companies to move RTR testing technology forward. The program will involve working with large pharmaceutical companies to run specific formulations as case studies in an effort to build up a toolbox of knowledge on how spectroscopic data can be used for RTR testing. Implementing closed-loop control is a step towards RTR. \"Intelligent processes that are proactively controlled to ensure the expected outcome are inherently capable of supporting a RTR strategy. Regulators have always stated that tight control of the unit operations leading up to final product is the best way to en-sure quality of the product and enable a RTR filing,\" says Hammond, who notes that Pfizer's Chantix RTR application is now filed in all major markets and most of the rest of world. \"The value of RTR has been reduction in laboratory testing. The focus in the future will be on en-abling a modern supply chain, with flex-ible response to a pull from the market, and maintaining lower inventory.\" Many in industry and academia say that continuous manufacturing using online PAT with closed-loop process control and real-time release represent the future of solid-dosage manufactur-ing. These concepts are part of a \"seis-mic shift in culture change within the pharmaceutical industry, which contin-ues to put the spotlight on manufactur-ing in a way that has been absent in the past,\" concludes Freeman.

Contamination of parenteral drug products can have serious consequences on the patient. To gain further insight into best practices for sterility assurance, Pharmaceutical Technology spoke to James Agalloco, president of Agalloco & Associates and member of PharmTech's editorial advisory board; Tim Sandle, head of microbiology at Bio Products Laboratory; and Beno\u00eet Verjans, scientific advisor at Aseptic Technologies and member of PharmTech's editorial advisory board. Sources of contamination PharmTech: What are the most common sources of contamination that can arise in sterile manufacturing or aseptic processing? Agalloco (Agalloco & Associates): We've known for years that the most common source of contamination has been the operator. There's been a steady progression of technology advances to reduce the problem that the presence of the worker presents. It started with curtains, and has progressed to closed restricted access barrier systems (RABS) and isolators. The next advancement in this area will be the use of robotics and automation to further reduce the impact of personnel. Sandle (Bio Products Laboratory): Parenteral drug products are required to be free from three things\u2014viable microorganisms, pyrogenic substances, and visible particulates. The different sources of microbiological contamination within clean environments can be divided into water, air, surfaces (both within the room and from equipment), and personnel. The main risk from water sources is to product formulation and the activities up to and including final steriliza-tion. In my experience, the greatest concern comes from wet equipment, allowing water-borne bacteria such as Pseudomonads to grow. Water is a double concern because it is a vector for contamination and a growth source for microorganisms. We cannot avoid water in cleanrooms. Water is a common feature in pharmaceutical processing (e.g., as an ingredient, a cleaning agent, a diluent for disinfectants, and steam supply). Other sources that affect aseptic processing include improperly designed clean air devices and air-flows that can direct microbial-carrying particulate contamination towards the exposed product. Verjans (Aseptic Technologies): There are two distinct categories of contamination of injectable drugs. Some contaminations are a result of bad practices; in this case, multiple containers are usually affected. These contaminations are identified through outbreak episodes that affect several patients. Ensuring Sterility of PARENTERAL PRODUCTS Adeline Siew, PhDThe other group of contamination is more insidious because it affects one vial from time to time. The source of contami-nation is a living organism that managed to penetrate the container at a certain moment and, if not detected, may trigger disease episodes such as septic shock. Because it is a single event, this type of contamination is often classified in the group of nosocomial diseases. Mitigating contamination PharmTech: What are the limitations or challenges to current sterilization methods? Agalloco (Agalloco & Associates): The obstacle we face is the expectation for higher F0 values, increased doses, and tighter filters. There is a belief that if we just make the process a little more lethal or more robust, it will be better. That ignores the whole other side of the process\u2014what it does to the materials we are processing. There is degradation, increased particles, extractables, less mechanical strength, and other impacts that oversterilization can cause. There needs to be more consider-ation of the negative consequences of what sterilization does. We only need to kill or remove the bioburden once. Over- processing is rampant and aside from making things look better on the surface, it's actually not something we should be doing. The half-cycle approach to sterilization should be used rarely, and unfortunately its use is becoming more prevalent rather than less. Sandle (Bio Products Laboratory): The main limitation with any sterilization method relates to the validation, the way it has been executed, and the way the validated sterilization technology is used in practice. One only has to look at the major pharmaceutical contamination scandals of the past 40 years to see this limitation, from the Devonport incident in the early 1970s to the issues surrounding the New England Compounding Center last year, where three lots of methylprednisolone acetate, intended to be injected into the spinal cord as a treatment for arthritis, were contaminated with Exserohilum rostratum (2). This incident led to more than 700 reported infections and some 48 deaths, based on figures from the US Centers for Realizing Quality of Life... Every Single Dose.

In both these cases, the sterilization equipment was involved. Besides validation issues, various factors (e.g., economic, space, time-to-release) drive the use of different sterilization technologies. The factor, however, is the product and whether it is compatible with the technology. The lower-risk technologies are terminal sterilization methods. Terminal steriliza-tion is most commonly carried out using steam (moist heat). Risks are often low provided the cycles have been validated thermometrically and biological indicators have been used to show that sterility-assurance levels are at 10 -6 as a minimum. A number of quality attributes must, however, be carefully checked for each run. Most important is air removal. It is crucial to ensure that all of the trapped air is removed from the autoclave before activation as hot air is a very poor medium for achieving sterility. The biggest challenge is aseptic filling. There are complications around product filtration relating to the validation of the product through the filter (where the filter needs to be challenged with 10 million cells of a diminutive bacterium); product bioburden; and issues relating to filter failure (for which post-use integrity checks are crucial). There are also the complica-tions of bringing together a sterile product and sterile components (vials, stopper, crimpers) and attempting to fill thousands of vials under a clean air zone. Verjans (Aseptic Technologies): There is a difference between terminally sterilized and aseptically filled products. For the first category, products are sterilized shortly after fill-finish, thereby eliminating contamination that could potentially put patients at risk. On the contrary, for aseptically filled products, there is a real concern of contamination because the last safety barrier provided by terminal sterilization is not there. From now, I will exclusively talk about aseptic processing, in particular fill-finish. The following is a list of contamination sources, among others:t\u00015IF\u0001QSPEVDU \u0001NBZ\u0001IBWF\u0001CFFO \u0001DPOUBNJOBUFE \u0001 during formulation so all precautions during fill-finish are useless as the contaminant during introduction of various elements (e.g., tools).t\u00015IF\u0001RVBMJU Z\u0001PG\u0001UIF\u0001FOWJSPONFOU \u0001NBZ\u0001 be at risk due to a tiny leak in high- efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters or in barrier integrity.t\u00015IF\u0001PQFSBUPS \u0001DBO\u0001CSJOH \u0001B\u0001DPOUBNJOBOU \u0001 especially if he is in close contact with the processing area. To have safe aseptic processing, it is mandatory to address all these aspects carefully, which therefore makes aseptic processing perhaps the most complex pharmaceutical manufacturing process. The challenges are to:t\u0001Prevent the contamination from coming in contact with the environment: The best approach is to optimize equipment design, set up clear and sound procedures, and train operators. Training is crucial as, even with the highest quality of equipment and procedures, the process is at risk without good operators.t\u0001Detect the co ntamination: Can we identify the contamination and eliminate it before it reaches and affects the patient?t\u0001Reduce the probability of transforming a contaminant into a contamination: The lower the exposure, the lower the risk. Recent advances PharmTech: What are the recent advances in equipment design, operation, filtration, or processes that are addressing some of these problems? Agalloco (Agalloco & Associates): The opera- tional improvements made by increased use of closed RABS and isolators are well known. Increased use of robotics and automation are making aseptic processing safer. Other technologies such as closed-vial filling, gloveless isolators and single-use systems will further enhance performance of aseptic manufacturing. Understanding the importance of bioburden destruction as opposed to biological indicator destruction would help as well. Sandle (Bio Products Laboratory): Clean- room technology did not advance greatly until the late 1990s. This pace of trans-formation has accelerated more quickly in recent years, notably with barrier technology. Aseptic filling risks have been lowered through the use of isolators and RABS. RABS create a physical and aerodynamic barrier to protect the product, but they are not all enclosing. Isolators are the most effective as they create a complete barrier (isolation) between the products and people. Where isolators can be placed around filling machines, it allows for the entire space to be decontaminated using hydrogen peroxide (either as a vapor or in the ionized state). Isolators are not risk free, however, due to issues such as air leakage. There has been some conceptual changes with cleanroom design, using computer-aided engineering software that can help pinpoint contamination risks. There are also advancements in the use of risk management, supported by initiatives from regulators such as FDA. Risk assessment tools such as HACCP (hazard analysis and critical control points) have become more common. Also with clean-rooms, various items of equipment and surfaces are now manufactured with antimicrobial coatings. With processing, the most important recent advances have come from single-use disposable technologies. Such technologies have reduced risks by allowing pharma organizations to move away from equipment that need to be sterilized or consumables that are recycled or pose a risk with their transfer into cleanrooms. Single-use items are typically sterilized using gamma rays, which kill microorganisms by destroying cellular nucleic acid. Verjans (Aseptic Technologies): In the last decade, multiple improvements have been introduced to mitigate the risk of contamination. The first one is to improve gowning of operators moving from classical laboratory coats to fully gowned operators. The second one is to use filters with extremely good efficacy in retaining living organisms, even the smallest ones and the mobile ones. The third one is to separate the operators from the processing area. Processing equipment can now be protected by advanced barriers such as the RABS and the most advanced Sterility Assurance \"Best Contract Manufacturing Organization\" Vaccine Industry Excellence Awards (2010-2012) Third Year in a Row For more information, visit baxterbiopharmasolutions.com Visit us at: ,17(53+(; \u0010 Booth #\u0016 \u0014\u0016 Baxter Galaxy trademarks of Baxter Internat ional Inc. 920810-00 6/12ones like the closed RABS and isolators. The isolators offer complete separation of the processing area from the environment, combined with an automated sanitization system. A new category of improvements consists of the reduction of exposure to the environment. Reducing the time when a container is open reduces the probability of having a living organism penetrating into the container. The same concept applies to contact of the inside part of the container. Two new technologies that aim to reduce this exposure include: t\u0001Blow-fill-seal technology, based on the concept of forming the container from heated polymer, filling it immediately after cooling and closing it without involving contact with another product part. The process takes a few seconds, thereby minimizing the probability of entry of living organisms. t\u0001Closed-vial technology, based on the concept of using a closed sterile con-tainer. The stopper, instead of being exposed to the environment, is already in place. Filling is done with a needle piercing the stopper and dispensing the liquid. Immediately after these opera-tions, the container closure integrity is restored by laser resealing of the stopper. It has been demonstrated that this tech-nology reduces the risk due to exposure by more than 100 times compared to open vials (3). Microbial control PharmTech: What are the limitations/ challenges to current testing methods for microbial control? Agalloco (Agalloco & Associates): We've exhausted the ability of microbial sam-pling and test methods to help us. The expected quantities of microorgan-isms are at or below the threshold of detection for most sampling methods. The only acceptable result in Class 100 (Grade A) is less than 1 colony-forming unit (CFU). There are problems with this because it suggests that aseptic pro-cessing has to be conducted under es-sentially sterile conditions, which is not possible, especially with the manned filling technologies in use. Aseptic pro-cessing can be successfully performed in less than sterile conditions, and that creates severe tensions between what we can provide in the way of environmen-tal and process control, and the extreme regulatory expectation of those same controls. Rapid microbial methods aren't the answer, because they only provide the results somewhat sooner. Sandle (Bio Products Laboratory): Moni- toring methods are divided into viable monitoring and nonviable particle moni-toring. The objective of viable environ-mental monitoring is to enumerate the numbers of microorganisms present at a location within a cleanroom, to allow incidents to be recorded and, ideally, to permit species level identification. This type of monitoring is undertaken using a range of different air and sur-face counting methods, namely active air-sampling using volumetric air-sam-plers; so-called passive air monitoring Sterility Assurance A better way to a better outcome. *8(66\u0003:+2\u0003-867\u0003+$'\u0003$1\u0003\u0003 AMRI SMARTSOURCINGTM MOMENT?

Concerns with these classic methods was highlighted in the recent update to the United States Pharmacopeia chapter <1116>, which argued that we need to get away from seeing these methods as somehow 'super accurate' such as an analytical instrument in a chemistry laboratory (2). The methods are limited because they can only be used periodically and thus serve as spot checks only. They cannot pick up all the culturable microorganisms present for example, due to weaknesses in collecting all the microorganisms that adhered to surface when using a contact plate. Recovery is also affected by temperature and agar variations. As another example, with active air-samplers, these devices are only designed to pick up 50% of the viable particles that are drawn in. There are risks with the method of drawing the air in, such as by impaction or through centrifugal forces, damaging or stressing the microorganism to the extent that it will not grow. It has been estimated that many of the micororganisms present in cleanrooms will not grow using the conventional methods. These are termed the viable but nonculturable (VBNCs) organisms. These same issues also affect in- process bioburden monitoring, used to measure contamination build-up in process areas, even with end-product sterility tests. There are, however, things that can be done to improve detection. With settle plates, it is important that the plates are tested to show that after exposure, due to the inevitable weight loss from drying out, they can still grow microorganisms. With contact plates used on surfaces, these plates should contain neutralizers to ensure that any residues from cleaning agents do not mask any microorganisms pres-ent. With swabs, the method will always be limited. However, there are new types on the marketplace that give bet-ter recoveries. Finally, with active air-samplers, tests should be conducted to show that the sampler does not disrupt the air-flow, especially at ISO Class 5. Verjans (Aseptic Technologies): Let's compare between large particle detec-tion in containers and environmen-tal monitoring. Particle detection is a systematic monitoring that screens all containers. The efficacy of the particle-monitoring process, even if not 100% perfect, is good enough to eliminate all or almost all containers containing a large particle, which is a potential source of embolism for the patient. This approach is not yet fea-sible with small living organisms and one way to address the contamination risk issue is to have environmental monitoring. This control is essential but presents the disadvantage of being based on samples. For example, contact plates and active air sampling are only targeting one sample of air; hence, the probability of detecting bacteria in the processing environment remains low. It has been estimated that approxi- mately 28 dm\u00b3 of air are in contact with each 2R glass vial (3). Therefore, classical microbial air monitoring systems collecting 1 m\u00b3 of air are only representative of 35 vials. Knowing that a batch may represent few hundreds of thousands of vials, statistical calculation demonstrates that the probability of detecting a CFU during microbial environmental monitoring is much lower than having one or few contaminated vials.

This year's show is noteworthy for productivity enhancements, anti-counterfeiting technology, and quality control options. Improved productivity On a single-rotary tablet press from Fette, the design of the compression sta-tions, drive, turret, and tablet discharge cuts changeover time and improves pro-ductivity. For example, turret removal requires no tools and takes only 15 min-utes. In addition, upper and lower com-pression rollers and pressure and position settings adjust automatically by means of commands from the operator interface; operators do not need to make manual adjustments after a turret change. The turret also features a coded tablet scraper and coded filling-cam detection as well as a central, multifunction connector for oil, air, and electricity. Equipped with up to 51 stations, the system produces up to 367,000 tablets per hour. The rotor design also supports quick changeover, maxi-mizes yields, and minimizes product loss. The machine is clad in easily detached, FDA-certified, high-performance poly- mer panels and offers 360-degree access. Geometrically optimized surfaces and an integral vacuum system expedite clean-ing. User-friendly operator interface pro-vides swift access to the machine's most important functions via 12 pictogram buttons (FE35 Tablet Press, Fette Com-pacting America). A high-performance liquid-filling ma- chine from Cozzoli Machine combines a small footprint with peristaltic pump and single-use technologies. Single-use elements eliminate cleaning, cut costs, hasten setup, and reduce waste. Designed for Class 100 cleanrooms, the fillers rely on existing overhead laminar air flow and may be specified with two, four, six, or eight heads (VR2PP Series liquid fillers, Cozzoli Machine). A single-use filling system from Fila- matic equips a benchtop filler, compat-ible with a piston, peristaltic, gear, or lobe pump, with a peristaltic pump. In this configuration, fluid flows in a flexible tube fitted inside a circular pump casing. Since the pumped fluid contacts only the inside surface of the disposable tubing, cleanup is quick and easy. The peristal-tic pump works best with moderate to large (50 mL to >1100 mL) fill volumes and achieves +/- 1% accuracy (AdaptaFil semiautomatic benchtop filler, Filamatic). Romaco's family of liquid filling ma- chines includes six models that handle vials and bottles ranging from 2-500 mL at speeds of up to 200 containers per minute. Features include multiple dosing system and volumetric pump options, ad-justable positive container transport for fast changeover, multiple closure stations and cap feeding systems, and program-mable setup and recall of product recipes and production parameters. The systems integrate seamlessly with labelers and cartoners (Romaco Macofar LF-200 Se-ries liquid America, subsidiary of MG2).

Compatibility with time-pressure, rotary piston, and peristaltic pumps increases system flexibility and allows it to fill dif-ferent products. A vial-handling system eliminates damage and noise associated with glass-to-glass contact (see Figure 1 ). A three-fold camera checks for glass par-ticles, residues, or deposits inside the vial to prevent contamination of the product and also can inspect filling and closing steps (Kombi Filling Rack on vial filling line, Groninger USA). A high-speed line from Marchesini Group, capable of filling parenteral prod-ucts at 400 vials per minute, consists of a rotary washing machine, depyrogenation tunnel, and filling/stoppering machine. The eight-station rotary washer cleans ampules, vials, and other round contain-ers and features quick size-changeover. A modular design accommodates the addi-tion of an ultrasonic prewasher, silicone applicator, heat exchangers, filters, auto-matic valves, automatic drainers, pressure transmitters, and unloaders to tunnel or tray. The continuous-motion depyroge-nation tunnel relies on modular design as well as hot-air flow. A pressurization sys-tem independently controls conditions in different sections of the tunnel. Proprietary cooling-zone sterilization cuts cycle time in half. The continuous-motion, in-line filler/capper features an ultra-clean balcony de-sign and is compatible with restricted ac-cess barrier systems and isolators, as well as clean- and sterilize-in-place configura-tions. Other features include contact-free vial handling, camera inspection, and checkweighing. Pump options include peristaltic, time-pressure, tamper evidence Smartphones help fight counterfeiting with an app designed to authenticate products in three seconds. As shown in Figure 2, the phone is positioned over packaging or molded parts to detect and verify covert safety features (e.g., taggants or microprinting, which looks like part of the graphics but reveals a message when examined under magnification). The verification action also can deliver information to the user/consumer about product features, user data, and mar-ket (smartphone authentication app for Cryptoglyph and Fingerprint covert safety features, AlpVision). Schreiner MediPharm's peel-off label for vials now includes a security ver-sion with overt and/or covert features to authenticate product and help prevent counterfeiting (see Figure 3 ). The mix of security elements can be customized and often can be added without changing the label design. Options include overt ele-ments, such as holograms, color-shifting security inks, and guilloche patterns, as well as covert tools, such as voiding ef-fects and LaserSecure, which relies on pigments that only can be \"seen\" by a dedicated handheld reader. The label also incorporates detachable segments for patient record updating and other purposes. For extra security, removal of detachable sections from the substrate re-veals the message, \"peel-off part has been removed\" (Pharma-Comb Security anticounterfeiting tool, a pro- prietary, two-dimensional barcode from Complete Inspection Systems, matches and verifies GS1 codes printed during packaging operations. The data-intensive barcode can provide information about the location of covert codes used for prod-uct authentication (HD P.A.S.S. Barcode Solution, Complete Inspection Systems). Rondo-Pak's tamper-evident carton de- sign opens and recloses as easily as a stan-dard folding carton and can be erected and loaded at the same speed as a conventional folding carton (see Figure 4 ). Perforations cause the lid and dust flaps to tear. The design reportedly surpasses first-opening verification security requirements of the Falsified Medicines Directive 2011/62/EU, which take effect in 2016 (tamper-evident folding carton, Rondo-Pak). Quality control technology A quiet (less than 70 decibels), compact tablet-deduster and testing system from Pharma Technology combines multiple functions such as segmented deduster spirals and metal detector on one base (see Figure 5 ). The high precision, in- process tablet tester checks weight, hardness, and thickness by sampling at regular intervals and feeds test data to the tablet press for recording into the batch record. Testers can be positioned on three sides of the base and offer push-fit, cable-free connections for power and data storage. A washable, exchangeable deduster module minimizes changeover time (AIO All In One Pharma Technology). PTFigure 3: Schreiner MediPharm's Pharma-Comb Security Label helps prevent counterfeiting.

NIBRT provides training, educational, and research solutions for the internationalbioprocessing industry in facilities lo-cated in South Dublin, Ireland. The Institute is based on a collaboration between University College Dublin, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin City University, and the Institute of Tech - nology Sligo. Michael Lacey is plant manager at NIBRT and is responsible for facility, equipment maintenance, and support services to the plant's core business of bioprocessing, training, and research. Although this inter-view focused on biopharmaceutical facilities, the advice is applicable to any pharmaceutical facility. Facility planning PharmTech: What do bio/pharmaceutical companies just starting out need to keep in mind in terms of planning a new facil-ity's location and construction? Lacey: There are many factors to con- sider in terms of choosing location, but some are crucial. First, the reality is that finance and commercial aspects are major considerations. The second cat-egory I would look at is the infrastruc- tural side and the existence of supportservices. Finally, for me perhaps, the most important factor to consider is the people who run the factory. People are the mostimportant asset a company has. T o expand on those three categories, let's look briefly at the financial and commercial side of things. Corpora-tions are interested in corporate taxes, local taxes, and charges that they willpay in a particular location. They will be looking at their transfer pricing pol-icy. They may have a treasury strategy. They may set up their financial head-quarters in a particular location along-side their manufacturing base. Companies will surely look at the availability of granted training sup-port, and they will be very interested in their cost base; that is, the cost of labor, salaries, wages, transport, and shipping. Very importantly in the European con-text, companies will be interested in access to markets in certain countries, particularly European Union countries. Looking at the infrastructural and support services side of things, manu-factured product must be brought to the market. Therefore, effective distri-bution, including storage and freight transport by road, rail, air, and sea, are very important. With regard to a spe-cific location, a company may prefer to set up where there is already a clusterof similar clients with similar require-ments. If such a cluster exists, there islikely to be support services available, such as laboratory services, mainte-nance services, project management, and regulatory expertise as well aseducational and research support from nearby institutes and colleges.The third category, people, is based on who will operate and manage the plant. It is crucial to have a strong pool of talented people who are well-educated, experi-enced, and flexible. Those people should also have continuing access to training and education. Energy management PharmTech: In terms of specific facility operations, can you address the common needs for energy management in bio/pharmaceutical manufacturing? Also, what key things should companies look for when planning for these systems? Lacey: Energy management is becom- ing increasingly important across the industry given the strong green agenda worldwide and the need to reduce carbon footprint. There is also a very strong need to reduce cost base, and energy cost is a major portion of the operational cost of most pharmaceutical plants. Companies fall into a number of categories in terms of how they manage energy. For example, there are companies who manage energy very well according to national and in-ternational standards. They dedicate re-sources to energy management, and these resources make a big difference to operat-ing cost. There are other companies who engage in energy projects and do quite well in terms of saving money, but per-haps, don't manage energy in a structured way. And then there are those companieswho do not address energy issues at all. Overall, energy must be factored into plant design and construction. It's particu-larly relevant to those who are looking at inward investment in new plant construc-tion. New plant construction provides an opportunity to get energy managementright. The problem that the industry faces Michael Lacey is plant manager at NIBRT, Fosters Avenue, Mount Merrion, Blac krock, Co. Dublin, Ireland.A Q&A with Michael Lacey of the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and TrainingBio/Pharmaceutical Facility Design and Operation: A Primer Register at: www .dowpharmsci.com or call: 707-285-1590 New Bruns wick, NJ Thursday 8:00 AM - 3:30 PM May 16th, 2013 Reception Wednesday 6-8 PM May 15th, 2013 www .dowpharmsci.com | 707.793.2600 | Petaluma, CaliforniaOur Focus \u2014Your Success Topical DermatologicalProductDevelopmentin the USA74 Pharmaceutical Technology APRIL 2013 PharmTech.comTroubleshooting in designing a plant is that it must com- ply with cGMPs and must be validated. Requirements for energy-usage reduction can sometimes conflict with cGMPs, for example, in relation to air changes, but I am convinced based on my experience that designers, production teams, quality teams, and engineering teams can work together to deliver an energy-efficient plant that is also GMP compliant. PharmTech: What other factors are at play with energy systems and cost? Lacey: There are many opportu- nities to make gains in terms of the building, such as good insulation and draft-proofing, use of solar gains, nat-ural lighting, intelligent lighting, com-pressed air usage, an optimum strategy for HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), and use of alterna-tive energy sources. HVAC systems are major energy users due to the require-ment to make air changes in rooms and to condition the air. Air changes represent scope for cost savings. For example, if you have a Grade B room with a national requirement of 20-30 air changes per hour, the air change rate should be critically reviewed to suit the operation. At the building-design stage, room sizing (i.e., volume) should also be optimized. Thus, the air moved and conditioned can be minimized and so minimize energy usage. Most HV AC systems in pharmaceutical processing applications are \"once-through\". How-ever, the use of recirculation systems should be adopted where possible as these are less expensive to run. Finally, room temperature control is key to optimizing energy usage. Room tem-peratures should be selected to suit the process and/or occupants. Lighting is an appreciable proportion of a plant's energy usage. High-frequency fluorescent systems allow for dimmable lighting, so facilities can use dimmers to control the lighting in a way that it reacts to ambient light level. If a building has natu-ral light, the fluorescent lighting levels can be dimmed accordingly. Lighting in public areas should react to presence and ambient natural light. \"Intelligent lighting systems\" should be considered.Air compressors represent another area of opportunity for cost savings. Compa-nies should analyze their air usage, and maybe use two or more smaller compres-sors rather than a single larger one. They should have variable-speed drives (VSDs) to allow maximum flexibility of response to demand. Most importantly, plant man-agers should ensure air leaks are repaired, as leaks can represent up to 30% of com-pressed air generation, and contribute significantly to energy wastage. In a me-dium size plant of 10,000 m 2, it can cost something like EUR 60,000-70,000 (ap-proximately $78,000-$91,000) per year to run a compressor. Lastly, it's important to train staff about energy management. People use energy, and if they are taught good hab-its (e.g., turning off lights and monitors), then money can be saved. PharmTech: You mentioned using two smaller air compressors instead of one larger unit. What benefit does this provide? Lacey: As I mentioned, an air demand analysis needs to be done before that decision is made. Your air compres-sor supplier can do this for you. This improves response and \"scalability\" between air demand and compres-sor running. One plant I worked with had a single large compressor supply-ing the entire factory and had a fixed-speed drive. The problem with this is that the motor either runs 100% or is off completely. This means that a large motor has to stop and start in response to changes in demand, and this is not energy-efficient. A smaller unit fitted with a variable-speed drive can respond more flexibly. Using two smaller com-pressors also means that you have a backup in case one unit fails. Water systems PharmTech: What considerations does a company need to make with setting up and maintaining bio/pharmaceutical-plant water systems? Lacey: Pharmaceutical water technol- ogy is well-established with a large num-ber of reputable and capable designers and providers available. For purified water (PUW), a good system will invari-ably include reverse osmosis (RO) and electrodeionization (EDI), with ozone as a sanitizer. It is critical that the raw water is carefully considered and factored into design; not enough attention is given to the quality of mains water and the pre-treatment of it. I can highly recommend ultra-filtration (UF) as a pre-treatment technology; we have installed this in NIBRT with excellent results. For water for injection (WFI), distillation is man-datory in Europe and almost the norm everywhere. It's important to get the system sizing correct, especially if con-sidering multiple-effect stills. For main-tenance, it is important to get specialist help from the vendors; however, I can't over-emphasize the importance of com-prehensive in-house monitoring by doing daily and weekly checks. This is a basic form of condition-based monitoring and is very effective. Environmental aspects of water sys- tems can be somewhat overlooked. We have talked about energy wastage; how-ever, we also use and waste quite a bit of water in this industry. Pharmaceutical plants are generally metered by local authorities, and they are charged by the cubic meter for water. This can be wasted in fairly innocuous ways. For example, PUW or WFI distribution loop pumps usually have \"flushed\" mechanical seals and the flushed water goes down to drain. It will look like a small flow, but this can drain a large tank over an extended pe-riod over 24 hours. The same applies to ozone sensors that are also flushed. So we waste a lot of PUW and WFI, which costs money, and depending on the loca-tion and the type of water plant, the cost can be very high\u2014PUW is estimated to HVAC systems are major energy users due to the requirement to make air changes in rooms and to condition the air.PACKAGINGSCALE UP & TECH TRANSFERMULTIPLE PROCESSES Aqueous & Solvent coating, encapsulating, Bi Layer Compression, granulation ANALYTICAL SERVICES Method Development & Validation CLINICAL TRIALS MATERIALCOMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING Large & small molecules, CI-CV, Highly Potent Compounds, Modied Release PRE-FORMULATION & FORMULATION ACTIVITIES API SERVICES Key Intermediates, High Value Active Ingredients PHARMACEUTICAL DEVELOPMENTA VARIETY OF DOSAGE FORMS Solids, Creams and Ointments, Suppositories Cutting-edge Pharmaceutical Development and Commercial Manufacturing services to get you where you need to go.

In terms of process, clean-in-place (CIP) is a common technology used in biophar-maceutical plants. It has the significant side benefit that it uses water efficiently. This technology is repeatable and reliable. Of course we use water for more mun- dane reasons also (e.g., drinking, wash-ing, toilets). There are automated water controls that can be well utilized to save on water and cost. GMP Certification PharmTech: GMP certification is impor- tant for the industry. What key GMP and cleanroom considerations need to be kept in mind if a company is trying to obtain GMP certification for its facility? Lacey: The key points in terms of GMP are that the facility must suit the operations being carried out and must minimize any possibility of errors and contamination. Achieving this is all about adopting best-practice conceptual and detailed design, and so the design process is crucial. As-suming the right teams are in place with the appropriate skills and experience, the current building and process technology is such that, while it is an onerous task, it is relatively straightforward technically to build and validate a facility. Given the na-ture of our business, a somewhat conserva-tive approach is best. The increase in single-use and con- tainment technologies offers opportuni-ties. Where before critical operations may have taken place in a Grade A environ-ment with Grade B background, newer technologies means that we can use rooms with a lower classification which are more cost-effective to build, maintain, and operate due to reduced energy usage, filtration requirements, and so on. Communication PharmTech: Communication is crucial. Could you comment on this based on your experience?Lacey: Good and effective commu- nication is probably one of the single greatest needs in a company and not every company does it too well. Compa-nies have to maximize teamwork within their operations, and good communica-tions are vital. Communication needs to be two-directional (i.e., top-down from management with an opportunity for staff to respond and put forward ideas). I strongly encourage meetings and brief-ings at the operations level, daily, and weekly. Verbal communication is so important, person-to-person and face-to-face. Email is a very useful tool; how-ever, all too often it is a poor substitute for verbal interpersonal communication; that is a skill we should maintain and de-velop. People are our principal assets and companies need to put a strong effort into developing people and developing communications and teamwork. Reference 1. BioPharm Intl. 26 (2) 46-51 (2013).

Call today to nd out PharmTech.com API Synthesis & Manufacturing Continuous-flow technology in- volves the continuous introduction of a stream of chemical reactants into a flow or microreactor to yield a desired reaction product on a con-tinuous basis (1, 2). Continuous-flow technology offers potential advantages compared with traditional batch man-ufacturing of pharmaceuticals, such as greater optimization and control of the process, improved safety and environmental profiles for a given pro-cess, and a reduced manufacturing footprint (1,2). Pharmaceutical com-panies, fine-chemical producers, and academia are pursuing continuous-flow chemistry in the production of APIs and related relevant reactions with several interesting developments in this field. Evaluating the technology In general, microstructured devices with small internal volumes and high surface-to-volume ratios offer transport capa-bilities for rapid mixing, enhanced heat transfer for good temperature control, and intensified mass transfer (1, 3). Micro-structured devices operate in a continu-ous-flow environment, which can provide controlled process conditions, high flow rates, and high mass throughput. Contin-uous operations also may allow for bulk-chemistry processes to have high produc-tion capacities. Fluid dynamics determine the characteristics of continuous-flow equipment, such as pressure loss, heat-transfer characteristics, residence time, and mixing time (1-4). The high surface-area-to-volume ratio comparative to a batch reactor enables better temperature control overall, including for exothermic reactions, which improves processing conditions. Scale-up issues may be mini-mized due to maintaining improved mix-ing and heat transfer. Recent activity These benefits are attracting investment and R&D in continuous-flow chemistry. IIMAGEWERKS/GETTY IMAGESContinuous flow chemistry offers potential for greater control, improved safety and environmental profiles, and efficient chemical transformations.

In February 2013, DSM Pharmaceuti- cal Products signed an agreement with Chemtrix, a supplier of flow-chemistry equipment and services, for providing equipment, development, and manu-facturing services to the pharmaceuti-cal industry. Chemtrix specializes in ready-to-use laboratory and kilo-scale microreactors as well as reactor and process design for industrial reactors. DSM provides drug-synthesis route development, scale-up, and implemen-tation of continuous-flow processes for manufacturing. DSM has FDA approval for using microreactors for making a pharmaceutical product at commercial scale under cGMP at its facility in Linz, Austria, where its dedicated commer-cial-scale installation is located. Initially, the DSM-Chemtrix collaboration will offer an industrial flow process-devel-opment package for customized scalable flow-chemistry solutions. The package covers all phases of process design, scanning chemistries, chemistry devel-opment, route scouting, equipment de-sign, and scale-up for fully continuous or integrated processes. Reflecting growing interest in mi- croreactor technology for fine-chemical manufacturing, Lonza invested in what it terms the \"Factory of T omorrow,\" at its facility in Visp, Switzerland. The in-vestment, made in 2012, enables produc-tion of multitons of intermediates and/or APIs based on continuous-flow pro-cessing. Lonza operates assets that can produce several kilograms to several tons of small-molecule APIs using microreac-tors, and the new unit in Visp adds an integrated solution where all common unit operations in flow can be stream-lined in a flexible fashion using micro-reactors (FlowPlate, Lonza) (1). This new unit integrates a range of flow reactors, such as continuous stirrer-tank reactors or ultrasounds and streamlines flow processes, including work-up unit oper-ations, such as liquid-liquid extraction and distillation (wiped-film, thin film). Higher pressure applications are enabled as well by allowing gas-liquid reactions, such as ozone and HCN chemistries. The technology can be used for chemi-cal reactions under severe and extreme conditions, such as high temperatures or cryogenic conditions (1). 80 Pharmaceutical Technology APRIL 2013 PharmTech.comAPI Synthesis & Manufacturing Technology advances Scientists at Eli Lilly recently reported on reactions in a continuous mode in plug-flow tube reactors (PFRs) to enable chemistry that would be difficult to per-form by means of batch processing. Spe-cifically, they developed two different continuous flow approaches for produc-ing a 1 H-4-substituted imidazole inter- mediate. In a first-generation approach, rapid optimization and scale-up of a cy-clization reaction was shown in a PFR under GMP conditions to produce 29 kg of protected product. This material was further processed in batch equipment to deliver the di-HCl salt. This approach showed the development of chemistry in research-scale PFRs and speed to ma- terial delivery through linear scale-up to a pilot-scale PFR under GMP condi-tions (5). In a second-generation effort, a more efficient synthetic route was de-veloped, and PFRs with automated sam-pling, dilution, and analytical analysis allowed for reaction optimization of a cyclization reaction and thermal re-moval of a Boc protecting group. This work culminated in 1-kg demonstration runs in a 0.22 L-PFR for both continu-ous steps and showed the potential of commercialization from a laboratory hood footprint (1-2 metric tons/year), according to the researchers (5). In another project, researchers at Eli Lilly reported on a fully continu-ous process, which involved an asym-metric hydrogenation reaction op-erating at 70 bar hydrogen, aqueous extraction, and crystallization that was designed, developed and demon-strated at pilot scale. Production of 144 kg of product was made in laboratory fume hoods and a laboratory hydro-genation bunker over two continuous campaigns (6). Maximum continu-ous flow vessel size in the labora-tory hoods was 22-L glassware, and maximum PFR size in the bunker was 73 L (6). The researchers reported that main safety advantages of running the hydrogenation reaction continu-ous rather than batch were that the flow reactor was smaller for the same throughput, and the tubular hydroge-nation reactor ran 95% liquid-filled at steady state. The amount of hydrogen in the reactor at any one time, there-fore, was less than that of batch. Ad-ditionally, a two-stage mixed suspen-sion-mixed product removal cascade was used for continuous crystallization (6). The researchers reported that im-purity rejection by continuous crys-tallization was better than by batch because scalable residence time and steady-state supersaturation allowed for repeatable control of enantiomer rejection in a kinetic environment (6). The researchers reported that a fully continuous wet-end process running in a laboratory infrastructure achieved the same weekly throughput that would be expected from traditional batch processing in a plant module with 400-L vessels (6). Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) recently reported on the application of compact crystallization, filtration, and drying for producing APIs. Specifically, they developed a combined crystallization and hybrid filtration-drying-dissolution apparatus for a compact manufacturing platform. Crystallization experiments using a conventional stirred tank and a newly designed scraped surface crys-talliser showed advantages in terms of crystallization rates, yields, and the ease of automation (7). The scraped surface crystallizer used an anchor impeller to create a closed clearance between the crystal-liser wall and impeller. The research-ers reported that the design prevented crystallization on the wall, generated large crystals to facilitate filtration, and improved draining and washing for automation. The hybrid device inten-sified three unit operations (filtration, drying, and dissolution/suspension) into a single unit. Intensifying these unit operations potentially reduces the time and material lost due to pump-ing and reduces contact between the API, the environment and operators. Postcrystallization operations were op-erated step-wise using the custom hy-brid device that delivered satisfactory results for each operation. Fluoxetine HCl was dried in less than 20 minutes, with 99% yield after dissolution in a liquid excipient (7). Effectively applying continuous-flow technology involves a multidisciplinary approach of chemistry and engineering. As an example, other MIT research-ers reported on the development of a Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reac-tion in a continuous-flow microreactor system. Suzuki coupling is a palladium-catalyzed coupling between organo-boron compounds and organohalides and is an important reaction in organic chemistry in general and for pharma-ceutical compounds specifically. The researchers developed a continuous-flow Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction that started from phenols and produced various biaryls in good yield using a microfluidic-extraction op-eration and a packed-bed reactor. The project used a multidisciplinary ap-proach with the research on microreac-tor technology developed by a team led by Klavs F. Jensen, department head, Warren K. Lewis professor of chemical engineering, and professor of materi-als science and engineering at MIT. The organic synthesis portion of the project was developed by a group led by Ste-phen Buchwald, Camille Dreyfus pro-fessor of chemistry at MIT (1, 4, 8, 9). Other developments Scientists at LyraChem, based in New-castle-upon-T yne, United Kingdom, and Newcastle University reported on intensified azeotropic distillation as an approach for optimizing direct amidation (10).

A systematic approach was developed to quantify the contribu-tion of boil-up rate to conversion rate and decouple the physical rates from the chemistry. Intensive boiling was used to improve the removal of water during azeotropic distillation and en- hance conversion. The researchers re-ported that some acylations previously thought to be difficult or impossible could be achieved in the absence of coupling agents under green conditions. A cascade of continuous stirred-tank flow reactors operating under intensi-fied conditions was assessed for scale-up of direct amidation reactions and compared to a production-scale batch reactor. The researchers reported that the use of the continuous stirred-tank flow reactors operating under intensi-fied conditions could provide the nec-essary high rates of heat transfer and, therefore, offer advantages over a con-ventional batch reactor system (10). Asymmetric synthesis is an impor- tant area of research for producing single enantiomer drugs. Research-ers in the Department of Chemistry, School of Science at the University of Tokyo, recently reported on the use of continuous-flow chemistry with chiral heterogeneous catalysts in asymmetric carbon-carbon bond formation (11). They developed and applied a chi-ral calcium catalyst based on calcium chloride with a chiral ligand to the asymmetric 1,4-addition of 1,3-di-carbonyl compounds to nitroalkenes as a model system (11). The research-ers sought to improve the low catalyst turnover number (TON) of asymmetric carbon-carbon bond-forming issues (12). To address product inhibition, the calcium catalyst was applied to contin-uous flow with a chiral heterogeneous catalyst. The continuous-flow system, using a newly synthesised, polymer-supported Pybox, was successfully used, and the catalyst TON was improved 25-fold compared with those of the previ-ous Ca(OR) 2 catalysts (11). Researchers at the Department of Synthetic and Biological Chemistry in the Graduate School of Engineer-ing, Kyoto University Nishikyo-ku, in Kyoto, Japan applied a flash-chemistry approach using flow microreactors to produce a highly reactive palladium catalyst with a tri- tert-butylphosphine (tBu 3P) ligand for a Suzuki-Miyaura coupling (12, 13). The flash chem-istry enabled the use of highly reac-tive unstable species as a catalysts for chemical synthesis. Fast micromixing of a solution of [Pd(OAc) 2] and that of tBu3P in an 1:1 mole ratio gave a solu- tion of a highly reactive unstable spe-cies, which was transferred to a vessel by using a flow microreactor, in which Suzuki-Miyaura coupling was con-ducted (13). The coupling reactions were completed in 5 minutes at room temperature, thereby preventing debo-ronation of the used aryl and hetero-arylboronic acids (12). In another study, researchers from the Institute of Science and Technol-ogy in Ikoma, Japan, and the School of Pharmacy and Molecular Sciences at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia reported on the diastereoselec-tive [2+2] photocycloaddition of a chiral cyclohexenone with ethylene in a con-tinuous flow microcapillary reactor (14). The researchers reported that the micro-capillary reactors have higher conversions and selectivity than the batch system even after shorter irradiation times due to bet-ter temperature control, light penetration and generation of gas-liquid slug flow with improved mass transfer in the mi-croreactor (14). In another development, research- ers at the Institute of Organic Chemis-try at Aachen University in Germany reported on the asymmetric (FTIR) spectroscopy in-line analysis (15). Reaction monitoring was achieved by using an in-line ReactIR flow cell, which allowed for optimiza-tion of the reaction parameters. The researchers reported that the reduc-tions proceeded well, and the desired products were isolated in high yields and with good enantioselectivities (15). References 1. P. Van Arnum, Pharm.

The approach provides the required International Conference on Harmonization validation elements as well as information on interactions, measurement uncertainty, control strategy, and continuous improvement. Despite being less resource intensive than the traditional validation approach, quality is not compromised. Additionally, through judicious planning, the MVbD approach can encompass early formulation design efforts so that a wide range of formulations is taken into consideration when defining the method- validation design space.Analytical method validation is a crucial part of formulation de v e l opmen t. I t i s needed to ens u r e th a t methods provide accuracy and precision in detecting formulation differences in drug dissolution, stability, active, and impurity levels. Method validation is also key to meeting require-ments of cGMP, compendia, and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) for testing and releasing clinical or commercial dosage forms. During early development, formula-tions are often changed to adapt to new preclinical and clinical data. Revalidating each of these new formulations is resource intensive and affects development timelines. The ICH Q2 (R1) validation guidelines (1) do not provide crucial information such as how formulation changes affect method performance or what method critical validation parameters need to be monitored and controlled. An ICH approach may not provide a good understanding of a method-measurement uncertainty, which is needed to ensure that the overall process capabilities are met and that appropriate in-process controls and specifications are set. This sort of understanding is needed to meet FDA's process validation guidelines (2). Once the product acceptance criteria are established, the influence of assay variation can be determined relative to product acceptance rates. This article describes a method-validation-by-design (MVbD) approach to validate a method over a range of formulations. It uses both design-of-experiment (DOE) and quality-by-design (QbD) principles to define a design space that allows for formulation changes without revalidation. The approach provides the required ICH validation elements as well as information on interactions, measurement uncertainty, control strategy, and continuous improvement. This approach is less resource intensive than the traditional validation approach without compromising quality. Additionally, through judicious pl anning, it can encompass early formulation design efforts so that a wide range of formulations can be used to define the method-validation design space. MVbD enablers MVbD is not specifically addressed in ICH; however, it is supported by the principles presented in ICH Q 8, 9, 10, 11 (3-6) as well as ICH Q2 (R1). There are other industry guidelines (2), publications (7-9) and presentations (10-15) that support a QbD/DOE approach for analytical method development and validation, including FDA's 21st Century Quality Initiative, which was first presented in 2001 and later updated in 2005 (15), and the outcome from FDA's 2013 PharmTech.comMethod Validation by Design DOE application The use of DOE is well established for determining method robustness, such as how much the mobile-phase composition, column temperature, and flow rate can vary. DOE is also well used in formulation screening. This approach broadens DOE to include method validation over a range of formulations. QbD application The MVbD approach applies to these QbD principles: t\u0001 Risk management assessment of the potential critical validation parameters. Systematic analysis (e.g., fishbone diagram) is done based on historical knowledge. The QbD/ DOE output confirms those that are critical. t\u0001 Analytical target profile (ATP). Once the required process capability is known, the required method accuracy and precision acceptance criteria are defined in the ATP. t\u0001 Control strategy. DOE output defines those parameters that have the most impact on the method performance. Monitoring these parameters throughout development will help define acceptable ranges. t\u0001Continuous imp rovement. MVbD provides the acceptance criteria that must be met to move to new technologies. t\u0001 Knowledge management. Knowledge gained is cycled backed to accelerate the next program. Traditional versus DOE approaches Traditionally, each new drug-product formulation requires validation to support clinical testing. In early development, the method is validated for linearity, accuracy, and precision. Method linearity is determined across five concentrations from 50% to 150% of the nominal (100%) concentrations. Accuracy and precision can be combined with the linearity study by doing six replicates at the 100% (nominal) concentration and three replicates at the other concentrations (50%, 75%, 125%, and 150%), which gives a total of 1 8 sample prepara- tions. If there are five new formulations during development that require separate validation, a total of 90 sample prepara-tions would be needed. This approach is resource intensive and affects project timelines. In this given example, only one formulation component is varied. As more components are varied, the workload increases proportionally. The challenge with this approach is: t\u0001 It does not statistically define a design space t\u0001 It does not employ QbD principles. A QbD/DOE approach validates a method over a range of formulations within a defined de sign space. Movement within this design space does not require method revalidation with each new formulation. The DOE approach detects any excipient- API interactions and critical validation control parameters. A DOE approach is not necessarily more labor intensive than the traditional method-validation approach and additional information gained is well worth the exercise. As described, the traditional approach requires at least 90 sample preparations to validate five formulations over the course of the development. Using DOE to validate across a broader range that includes these five formulations would require only three determinations for each of the five formulations, resulting in a total of 15 sample preparations. Steps to perform a MVbD t\u0001Step 1: Define the range of formulations and required process capability. A formulation screening DOE may be used to determine all possible clinical formulations for the study. Manufacturing proces s capabilities need to be considered to define the ATP (i.e., the necessary accuracy and precision to ensure acceptable data). Full factorial, fractional factorial and/or custom (d-optimal) design all may be used in developing the study design. t\u0001Step 2: High-performance li quid chromatography (HPLC) method selection. A method should be developed such that sample preparations of the different formulation can be diluted to the same API concentrations. The diluted sample from each formulation is injected onto the HPLC column under the same chromatography conditions. Standardizing these conditions will facilitate DOE and latter method-robustness studies. t\u0001Step 3: DOE design. The set up of the DOE can be accom- plished with or without using DOE software. Inputs to the DOE include a number of varying factors, such as the different API levels and/or excipient and preservative levels. t\u0001Step 4: ICH statistics and design space. Data are analyzed for linearity, precision, and accuracy, including confidence intervals. Any interactions are reported and a design space Table I: Hypothetical range of formulations.

The design space is defined by fitting a model to the factors used in the evaluation of assay concentrations and other key factors that may interfere or influence assay precision or bias. After fitting the model, the design space may be visualized using contour plot or profilers. Case study To illustrate the MVbD process, a simulated case study is presented where three factors are varied over a range of formula- tions (see Table I ). The API concentrations 0.005%, 0.01%, (w/w) and concentrations of Excipient 3 are either 0.5% or 0. 8% (w/w). The DOE design is shown in Figure 1 . The DOE pattern is presented as 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 --, -+, +- or ++. The numbers 1 through 5 represent the five API concentrations and the \"+\" or \"-\" represent with or without the two possible preservative and excipient concentrations. Three replicates are done for each combination of API, preservative, and excipient concentration. A total of 60 sample preparations is required. The DOE typically suggests a randomized sample preparation to avoid any sample preparation variability; however, because the variability is low, a standard sample-preparation scheme can be followed. Figure 1 also presents the percent recovery data. The required ICH statistics can be obtained from these data. For example, Figure 2 shows linearity data along with typical linearity statistics. One key output is the root mean square error (RMSE); this parameter identifies method variability that is critical for understanding the method contribution to the overall process variability. Figure 2 also shows linearity plots of percent recovery versus the two excipient concentrations. The dif ference in slopes indicates interaction (i.e., a lower API recovery at a higher level of Excipient 3 concentration), possibly due to interaction of the excipient with the API. Such information is important for the formulator and method developer to consider if higher preservative levels are needed.

Design space. A design space is illustrated in Figure 4 . It is obtained by mathematically modeling the primary main effects and secondary two-factor interactions as well as possible polynomials using a DOE software. The operating range is the white space shown in Figure 4 ; it is where the method accuracy and precision meet the acceptance criteria. Adding formulations outside this range would require confirmatory testing. System linearity, quantitation limits (QL), and detection limits (DL). To ensure the sample amount injected is within the linear range of the detector, a separate experiment can be done where the sample concentration is varied from 50% to 150% of the nominal (100%) concentration. If the potency method is also used to quantitate impurities, a wider linearity study can be performed from 100% to 0.03%. The QL and DL for the impurities can be determined by the ratio of RMSE to the slope, as described in ICH Q2 (R1). Other MVbD outcomes Control strategy. Figure 4 shows there is less precision (i.e., higher standard deviation and confidence values) at the higher API levels for lower amounts of Excipient 3. This lower precision is approaching the accept- ance limit. Similarly, accuracy is approaching the acceptance limit as the excipient and API levels increase. These parameters need to be monitored in case the method needs to be optimized prior to transfer to the final manufacturing site(s). Continuous improvement. The contour profiler (top graph) in Figure 5 shows a graph of the balance between precision and bias and its influence on product acceptance/failure rates based on the DOE data. Combinations of method precision and bias must fall within the designated white space to meet the acceptance criteria. The equation for how precision and bias influence product acceptance rates is as follows: [ ][ ][ ] 1-Normal Distribution 1 lower acceptance criteria, USL = upper acceptance criteria, bias = mean percent recovery - 100%, nominal = 100%, and precision = mean standard deviation. The prediction profiler (bottom graphs) in Figure 5 allows the precision and bias to be varied to determine the impact on % acceptance rates. This tool can be used to justify moving to new technologies and new specifications by showing that the acceptance criteria will still be met. Knowledge management. The lower recovery of API observed at high levels of excipient concentrations adds to the formulator's knowledge base. If higher excipient concentrations are needed in fu ture formulations, this aspect needs to be considered. Regulatory strategy and potential hurdles Since the MVbD approach is not specified in ICH regulations, not all regulatory agencies may accept this approach. Some filing strategies are briefly discussed.

The details can be present in a MVbD design protocol along with a rationale for moving within the design space without revalidation. Moving outside the design space could be justified through the use of comparability protocol. t\u0001EMA and the rest of the world: Submission of the MVbD rationale, justification, and prot ocol early in the development process is warranted since a face-to-face conversation may not be possible. Alternatively, this information can be supplied when responding to any agency questions. Conclusions The MVbD approach is statistically rigorous and scientifically defensible. It is in line with current regulatory thinking and allows movement to new formulations within the design space without revalidation. The MVbD approach provides a better understanding of the critical parameters of a method and allows greater flexibility and speed during formulation devel- opment, especially when time and resource are under con- straints. Through judicious planning, MVbD can encompass early formulation design efforts so that a wide range of for- mulations can be used to defi ne the method-validation design space. Once the ATP has been defined, movement to new analytical technologies and formula tions is justified as long as the ATP criteria are met. This approach enables continuous improvement for efficiency and quality gains. Control strategy, knowledge management, and measurement uncertainty are other key MVbD outputs. The DOE identifies critical validation parameters to monitor and control. The DOE also adds to the knowledge base that will help accelerate future programs. Knowing the method contribution to overall process variability enables setting appropriate in-process controls and product specifications. Internal company alignment is needed to support a MVbD approach and define a global filing strategy. Early discussions and a presentation of a MVbD protocol to regulatory agencies can help avoid questions during regulatory submission review. Additional studies can be done to expand the design space but not all changes may require additional studies, for example: t\u0001 Changing a grade or source of excipient (e.g., from one grade of lactose to another) t\u0001 Using a similar excipient t\u0001 Different drug substance process. Some of these and other changes may be justified based on the degree of interactions seen from the DOE data. For example, a source change in lactose may be justified if there are no interactions seen at higher lactose concentrations and historical data on other formulations has shown no impact.

Hill, Todd Nelson, Elizabeth Kwong, Tim Rhodes, Brian Farrer, and Allen Templeton Formulations for preclinical safety assessment studies are often prescreened by formulation scientists in vitro prior to use in animal models. By simulating the precipitation characteristics of a formulation in biorelevant media, the performance of a formulation can be predicted. The predictability depends on the sensitivity of detection and simulation of the mixing of the vehicle and biorelevant media. The authors describe the miniaturization of these types of experiments using a microfluidic chip system, combined with detection by optical microscopy. The results show the potential of microfluidics as a tool to help reduce compound requirements, time, and costs in formulation development. Dispersion experiments are heavily used in the pharma- ceutical industry to screen potential oral formulations in vitro. The studies are run to rank how several formulations will perform prior to dosing new chemical entities in vivo . The experiment intends to mimic what occurs as the formulations are dosed orally and traverse through the gastrointestinal tract (1, 2). This experiment also is used to understand the mecha-nism of variability upon oral dosing. As a result, compound and animal resources can be spared when failed formulations are not pursued in actual animal studies. This experiment is par-ticularly useful in drug discovery and development by saving time and resources while still advancing drug candidates. Microfluidic systems Microfluidic systems are evolving as useful tools for mini- aturizing a variety of standard laboratory experiments (3). Many industries are using such systems, and more recently, the pharmaceutical industry is taking note (4). There are applications for microfluidics across the pharmaceutical industry ranging from scaling down the synthesis of chal- lenging molecules to evaluating the effects of new chemical entities on biological systems (5). Microfluidic systems are of particular interest to the pharmaceutical sciences as tool s for formulation development. Emulsion-based formulations are highly prevalent in the industry. Okushima et al. demonstrated that monodispersed double emulsions could successfully be generated with tunable control over the size and number of internal droplets produced (6). In this example, a specialized chip with hydrophobic and hydrophillic junctions was used to generate the various double emulsions. Liposomes also have been of interest to formulation scientists for several decades (7). Jahn et al. demonstrated the successful generation of liposomes on a microfluidics device ( 8). The liposomes generated were monodispersed, and the size of the particles was controlled by varying the flow rate. The mixing capabilities of the chip allowed liposomes to self-assemble in the channel, which would also allow for drug encapsulation and ultimately liposomal f ormulation preparation. Both of these studies used droplet-based microfluidics. The liposome-generation example us ed the microfluidic technique of hydrodynamic focusing, and the double-emulsion example Nicole L.

With respect to droplet microfluidics, the methods are complementary. In general, droplet-based microfluidic systems have the advantage of creating separated droplets that distinguish small amounts of reagents (10). T-junction droplet-generation systems are particularly flexible as several T-junctions can be placed in tandem, thereby allowing sequential reactions or mixing opportunities to occur. This article describes the use of a T-junction droplet microfluidics system to evaluate oral formulations of select model compounds by executing a simulated gastric fluid (SGF) redispersibility experiment directly on a microfluidics chip. This article describes preliminary proof-of-concept experiments. Morever, the results show the potential to save significant amounts of compound, animal resources, time, and cost in developing formulations for new chemical entities. Experimental The following materials were used in the study: naproxen (Chemical Number 9005-65-6, Tween 80, Fisher Scientific. Formulations were prepared at 50 mg/g concentration representing a 100 mg/kg dose in vivo when PEG 400 is dosed at 2 mL/kg. Model compounds naproxen and naphthol were fully solubilized at this concentration. In addition, naphthol was prepared at 100 mg/g in 1:1 Imwitor 742:Tween 80. The compound also was fully solubilized. SGF was prepared by dissolving 2.0 g of sodium chloride (NaCl) in 1 L of deionized water and adjusting the pH to 1.2 with 1 N HCl (hydrochloride acid). The microfluidics system was fr om Dolomite Microfluidics, and the experiments were run on a standard quartz T-junction chip with a channel size of 190 m. The reagents were fed into the chip using three Dolomite Mitos Pressure Pumps (P-Pumps) with the pressure attenuated based on the viscosity of the liquids. The experiments were run at room temperature. After the experiments were completed, the chips were disassembled and transferred to either a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope or a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope, both equipped with a polarizing light filter to assess crystallinity. Results and discussion The microfluidic system used for this study was the Dolomite pressure-based dr oplet microfluidics system. The experiment required three Mitos-P pumps with one equipped with a three-way outlet head. A standard quartz channel chip was used, which was optically transparent and stable to organic reagents. Figure 1 shows an image of the chip relative in size to a penny and also the sche- matic representation that is used throughout this article. In the T-junction schematic, the phase coming through Channel B would be considered the \"dispersed\" phase that would be dispersed within the \"continuous\" phase flowing though Channels A and C. The lines are supplied by the Dolomite P pumps, with the pressures adapted to the indi- vidual viscosity of each liquid and until suitable droplet size is achieved (droplets of B within the carrier fluid channeled through Channels A and C). The goal of these experiments was to see whether a typical redispersibility experiment could be performed on a droplet-generating microfluidics system. The redispersibility experiment involves preparing a formulation, either Figure 1: Quartz microfluidic channel chip used in experiments as compared to the size relative to a penny and the schematic representation of the chip (top) and the naproxen formulation in polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) dispersed as a plug in the carrier fluid perfluorodecalin (PFD) (bottom). The plug is optically distinguishable from the carrier fluid and also traveled freely through the channel.

Potential outcomes include the compound crashing out as either crystalline or amorphous physical phase or the compound remaining completely solubilized. If the starting formulation is a solution, when the compound of interest precipitates from the formulation vehicle, it is considered a less favorable formulation as this will render the active compound less absorbable in the intestinal barrier. The initial experiment performed was to generate a plug of a solution formulati on of naproxen dissolved in PEG 400 within the carrier fluid, PFD, to verify that the viscous PEG 400 would travel through the channel of the chip, which proved successful (see Figure 1 ). PFD was chosen because as a fluorocarbon, it is immiscible with PEG 400 and the aqueous-based SGF. In this experiment, the carrier fluid was plumbed through Channels A and C as depicted in Figure 1, and the naproxen/PEG 400 formulation was brought in through Channel B. The naproxen/PEG 400 formulation was successfully \"plugged\" in the PFD carrier fluid and was visually distinct and traveled easily through the microfluidic channel. Next, the same naproxen in the PEG 400 formulation was dispersed into SGF on the benchtop, and the resulting suspension was plumbed through the chip. The experimental design was the same in that Channels A and C were the PFD carrier fluid and Channel B was the suspension of the naproxen formulation dispersed (on the benchtop) in SGF. This experiment verified that plugs of a formulation suspension could travel through the channel of the chip. For visualization, the chip was removed from the microfluidics chip-holder system and examined with polarized light microscopy. The characteristic birefringence was observed through the quartz chip, suggesting that the naproxen precipitates from the PEG 400 as crystalline material (see Figure 2 ). Dispersing the naproxen in PEG 400 formulation into SGF directly on the microfluidic chip was attempted next. The design of the experiment is outlined in Figure 3(a ). The naproxen in PEG 400 formulation (see pink channel, Figure 3 [a]) , SGF (see yellow channel, Figure 3 [a]) , and carrier fluid (PFD, see grey channel , Figure 3 [a]) were plumbed into three separate lines with the intention of generating droplets of dispersed formulation in SGF separated by the carrier fluid at the junction of the chip. This experiment was somewhat unsuccessful as the high viscosity of the PEG 400 formulation line caused significant backflow issues. The formulation precipitated; however, there was no controlled droplet generation. Looking at the chip under polarized light indicates the naproxen/PEG 400 formulation crashed out of solution generating a crystalline precipitate, which was a promising result; however, more control was desired. To achieve more control over the redispersibility experiment, the experimental design was changed. In the new experiment, SGF droplets (see yellow channel, Figure 3 [b]) were first generated in the carrier fluid [see grey channels Figure 3 [b] ) and as they exited the chip, the exit line of tubing was replumbed into one of the bottom channels of the microfluidics chip. The second of the lower channels of the chip was plumbed with the naproxen in the PEG 400 formulation (see pink channel, Figure 3[b] ). This experiment proved successful as once the formulation was dispersed into the SGF droplets, the new combined droplets continued to travel through the channel. In addition, the timescale was appropriate to observe the precipitation of the naproxen into crystalline material before the newly formed droplets exited the chip (see Figure 4) . Having demonstrated that it is possible to perform a redispersibility experiment within a microfluidic chip, the final experiment aimed to differentiate between different formulations of a model compound.

The difference in concen trations of these two formulations represents the difference in dosing volumes for the vehicles when administered at the same dose. The design of these experiments follows the schematic detailed in Figure 3(b) . The naphthol formulation in PEG 400 was dispersed first. As the formulation mixed with the SGF droplets and traveled through the channel, there was no precipitation event (data not shown). Imwitor 742:Tween 80 is a known self-emulsifying drug-delivery system (SEDDS) (11). SEDDS vehicles are typically comprised of oils and surfactants and solubilize highly lipophilic compounds. Upon reaching the aqueous environment of the stomach, the vehicle creates emulsions, which often boost in vivo exposure. When this formulation of naphthol was mixed with SGF droplets at the T-junction, the emulsifying nature of the vehicle was observed. This emulsion property is particularly evident when viewed under nonpolarized light (see Figure 5 inset ). When viewed with the polarizing filter on the microscope, it is clear that the naphthol compound was precipitating out as evidenced by the birefringence observed at the interface of the two solutions. The precipitation, however, was somewhat impeded by the emulsification of the Imwitor 742:Tween 80 vehicle, and no distinct crystal habit was formed (see Figure 5) . Having shown it was possible to disperse a formulation in SGF on a chip, a comparison experiment was conducted examining how the same formulations behave when dispersed in SGF on the benchtop. Standard SGF dispersion experiments were set up where the solution formulations of naphthol in PEG 400 and naphthol in Imwitor 742: Tween 80 [1:1] were dispersed into SGF at a ratio of 1:1. These experiments were run in small scintillation vials equipped with stirbars. Figure 6 shows the formulation vials prior to and after SGF dispersion. The results of the traditional benchtop SGF dispersion experiment parallel what was observed in the microfluidic dispersion experiments. Upon dispersion into SGF, the naphthol in PEG 400 formulation remained a solution, and the naphthol in Imwitor 742:Tween 80 [1:1] formulation became cloudy. Conclusion These experiments demonstrate the proof of concept that a dispersion experiment can be performed within a T-junction microfluidics chip system. When individual droplets of SGF were mixed with formulations at the T-junction, the model compounds either stayed in solution or precipitated out. When the compounds did precipitate out, information about the physical form of the precipitated chemical entity was obtained as the microfluidic c hip is visualized under polar- ized light microscopy. As there are significant benefits, scaling down redispersibility experiments also was explored by other groups. Dai and Mansky (12, 13) describe a method using a 96-well plate that uses a small amount of compound to screen the solubilizing effect of several excipients once dispersed into simulated intestinal fluid [SIF]. The method is further validated by comparing the results of the miniaturized experiments to traditional formulation dissolution testing and actual in vivo studies (14). In addition, Gopinathan et al. (15) developed a 96-well plate based high- throughput formulation screening strategy. The company TransForm (16, 17) has developed similar high-throughput formulations screens, even extending to a 3 84-well plate. For these examples, the reagents are mixed by vortexing or sonicating the plate, or in some cases, heating to solubilize the initial compound. These examples illustrate the direction the pharmaceutical industry is headed with respect to formulation screening in the discovery space: using small amounts of compound to evaluate many different formulations. The experiments detailed in this article are complementary as they use microfluidic technology, Figure 5: Dispersion of th e naphthol/Imwitor 742:Tween 80 formulation dispersed in simulated gastric fluid directly within the microfluidic chip channel. The image was taken under polarized light. Inset: nonpolarized light image. Figure 6: Naphthol/polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) formulation before and after dispersion into simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and naphthol/Imwitor 742:Tween 80 [1:1] formulation before and after dispersion into SGF.100 Pharmaceutical Technology APRIL 2013 PharmTech.comMicrofluidics in Formulation Development specifically T-junction droplet generation. Although not as developed as the afor ementioned examples, this method offers the potential benefit of in situ mixing that droplet microfluidics offers (1 8, 19). This feature would be beneficial when highly viscous formulations are evaluated and may be a better representation of how formulations are dynamically mixed in the gastrointestinal tract. Further, microfluidic technology has the potential to consume even less compound than what would be used in a 384-well plate experiment. Future experiments under consideration by the authors include a two-step SGF and fasted state SIF redispersibility study that would more closely mimic the transport of a compound from the acidic environment of the stomach to the more neutral pH (i.e., pH 6.5) of the small intestine. In addition, the system can be temperature-controlled, and the effect of temperature on these types of experiments may be explored. In summary, scaling down redispersibility experiments to the microfluidic scale has the potential to have significant impact on how formulations are screened in the pharmacuetical industry. Performing redispersibility experiments on a much smaller scale allows more formulations to be screened in vitro using less material. When combined with more powerful detection techniques, the experiment also can provide more understanding of the behavior of the physical phase in the gastrointestinal environment. This information can help formulation development scientists iden tify and understand the most effective formulations for future in vivo experiments more efficiently.

Fats and fixed oils are processed from natural sources and have complex chemical compositions. As part of the public standards-setting processes, USP staff and the Excipients Expert Committee have formulated a strategic analytical testing plan for fixed oil excipients. The plan balances modernization with ease of adoption and method si mplicity. Modernization introduces more specific compositional methods that can identify as well as quantify the analyte(s) of interest. A combinatio n of simple orthogonal methods uses existing in strumentation that can be applied to a multitude of fixed-oil monographs and encourages ease of adoption. This plan also has helped make possible the development of USP Reference Standards for such complex excipients because the proposed analytical methods provide a comprehensive understanding and characterization of fixed oils.

The 31 oil excipients include vegetable oils (edible), petrochemical oils, and essential oils. All vegetable oils are termed \"fixed oils\" in USPNF . The term fixed oils distinguishes them from the relatively volatile petrochemical oils and essential oils. Fixed oils are obtained by expression or extraction. Their consistency varies with temperature: some are liquid (oils), others are semisolid (fats), and still others are solid (tallows) at ambient temperature. Most fixed-oil excipients included in USP-NF are refined oils. Twenty-four of the 31 USP-NF oil excipients are fixed oils or fixed oil derivatives. Most fixed oils consist mainly of tri-glycerides (or triacylglycerols). The four USPNF mineral oils in Table I are classified as petrochemical oils: each is defined as a purified mixture of liquid hydrocarbons obtained from petroleum. The three volatile essential oils (see Table I ) are composed primarily of acyclic monoterpenoids, terpenes and their derivatives, or aromatic compounds and their deriva-tives, and contain lesser quantities of alcohols, aldehydes, es-ters, and/or phenols. Three of the 22 USP-NF fixed oils\u2014castor oil, soybean oil, and safflower oil\u2014are designated as USP, and the remaining fixed oils are designated as NF. The USP-NF fixed oils can have different functions. The majority are used as oleaginous vehicles or solvents in drug formulations. However, some are used as emulsifying agents, flavors and perfumes, ointment bases, plasticizers, stiffening agents, tablet or capsule lubri-cants, wetting or solubilizing agents, or coating agents. Need for modernization Monograph test deficiencies before modernization. Incidences of intentional adulteration have increased in recent years, and adulteration has become a major concern as supply chains continue to expand globally. Intentional adulteration can include the dilution of expensive fixed oil products with cheaper substances. Compendial standards in existence for a long period of time may require updates to keep pace with current regulatory and safety requirements and to incorpo-Fixed-Oil Excipient Monographs Development of USP Fixed-Oil Reference Standards Hong Wang, Catherine Sheehan, Lawrence H. Block, Richard C. Moreton, Richard H. Wendt, Shireesh P. Apte, and Eric J. MunsonPharmaceutical Technology APRIL 2013 103rate advances in analytical methodology and metrological science (2). Further, substances derived from natural sources histori- cally were characterized mostly from a safety perspective using generally applicable but nonspecific tests to detect ele-mental impurities, residual process impurities, and pesticides. Because of the deficiencies in these fixed-oil excipient mono-graphs (see Table I ), users were unable to relate the material's chemical composition to its physical and chemical properties or to anticipate any potential degradation or decomposition during storage. A majority of the oil monographs, including petrochemical oil and essential oil monographs in USP 28-NF 23 (2005) did not contain identification tests and thus would conform with difficulty to current GMPs (3). In fixed-oil excipient monographs before modernization, most procedures for testing fixed-oil substitutes were wet chemistry-based methods with undefined or poor sensitiv-ity and specificity (e.g., color reactions caused by the presence of particular nonfat ingredients). Therefore, it was desirable to replace these wet chemistry tests with tests that could de-tect specific adulterants or contaminants. Incorporating such tests in USPNF fixed-oil monographs could help ensure the authenticity of the fixed oils. Most importantly, monograph modernization should introduce tests to determine fixed oil chemical composition specifications. The development of USP general chapters to characterize fixed oils USP General Chapter Fats and Fixed Oils < 401>. USP General Chap- ter Fats and Fixed Oils <401> includes several test procedures to characterize and determine the properties of fats and fixed oils. Before its proposed revision that appeared in 2008, the chapter contained mostly simple wet chemistry-based meth-ods to measure values characteristic of fats and fixed oils such as acid value (free fatty acids), ester value, hydroxyl value, iodine value, and saponification value (4). Essentially, these tests used chemical reactions to quantitatively estimate the selected functional group(s) or to calculate\u2014but not neces-sarily to identify\u2014the constituents of a fat or oil. Thus, ester value, hydroxyl value, iodine value, and saponification value tests traditionally are treated as oil and fat structure index tests. These indices, especially if combined, help to provide a rough idea of the identity of the sample. A triglyceride can be hydrolyzed to fatty acids and glycerin. Thus, the acid value (free fatty acids) test is used as a measure of the degree of an oil's hydrolysis. In addition, peroxide value, anisidine value, and total oxi- dation value (totox) tests also were included in general chapter <401> before the 2008 revision (4). The tests for anisidine value and total oxidation value (totox) were proposed in 2003 to support several monographs that contain polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly some dietary supplement monographs (5). Fats and oils containing unsaturated fatty acids are prone to oxidation. Peroxide value, anisidine value, and total oxi-dation value (totox) tests using wet chemistry principles can reveal the extent of oxidative degradation of fats and fixed oils. Peroxide value measures the amount of primary oxi-dation products such as hydroperoxides, and the anisidine value measures secondary products including aldehydes and ketones. Because the tests can determine the extent of oxida-tive deterioration, they are useful analytical tools to predict the expected shelf life of a fat or oil and to monitor an oil's stability. Before the proposed revision in 2008, <401> also provided tests for unsaponifiable matter, solidification temperature of fatty acids, and fatty acid composition (4). The latter employs a modern gas chromatographic (GC) test procedure to ana-lyze the distribution of fatty acid moieties that are attached to the three hydroxyl groups of the glycerin backbone if the sample is a fat or fixed oil. Fatty acid composition yields more detailed and reliable information when compared with these oil and fat structure index tests and thus has improved the identity determination of fats and fixed oils. Because fatty acid composition can determine the percentages of each fatty acid group, structure indices such as iodine value and saponification value can be calculated or estimated based on the fatty acid composition profile (6-8). However, fatty acid composition is subject to considerable variation and presents challenges, the details of which are discussed in a later section. See us at INTERPHEX NYC, Booth 1680104 Pharmaceutical Technology APRIL 2013 PharmTech.comThrough the 2005 and 2006 revisions, the test for acid value was revised to include another titrant, to provide a calcu-lation formula, and to add an additional test procedure allow-ing use of a different solvent mixture (9,10). The 2008 revision replaced all the descriptive texts used in the calculations under the test sections with the appropriate calculation formula (4). Additionally, three new test sections were proposed: omega-3 fatty acids determination and profile, trace metals, and sterol composition. These methods were introduced using a modern instrumental analysis approach. These additions enhanced the quality of General Chapter <401> by providing compendial users further analytical methods that help to better charac-terize and evaluate fats, fixed oils, and related substances and that ensure purity of fixed oils and absence of adulteration. USP General Chapter Injections <1>. In 2006 stakeholders indicated that the test procedure for unsaponifiable matter described in general chapter <1> in USP 28-NF 23 was un- clear and created uncertainty with regard to reporting of results (11). USP staff and EM2 EC concluded that the test criterion for unsaponifiable matter under Other Vehicles in Ingredients, Vehicles, and Added Substances in <1> was subjective and thus unsuitable for its intended purpose, but the EC acknowl-edged the importance of the test for unsaponifiable matter for injectable products because it measured impurities such as waxes, phospholipids, and proteinateous matter to which patients could be allergic. In addition, the original cottonseed oil NF monograph did not provide quality specifications for use as an injection ve-hicle. As a result, the monograph required revision to reflect its use in an intramuscular injection product. The EC also considered additional specific tests and appropriate accep-tance criteria for this specific grade of oil. EM2 EC collaborated with the Parenteral Products\u2014In- dustrial EC to revise the tests under Other Vehicles in Ingre-dients, Vehicles, and Added Substances in <1> by means of a proposed revision published in 2008 (12). A quantitative test procedure for unsaponifiable matter and a test for acid value replaced the previous test for unsaponifiable matter and the test for free fatty acids. Thus quantitative specifications for acid value and unsaponifiable matter were introduced. Three additional tests and acceptance criteria also were introduced into <1>: Peroxide Value, Water, and Limit of Copper, Iron, Lead, and Nickel. All three tests are crucial quality control measures for fixed oils used in parenteral drug formulations. Usually, specifications for peroxide value and water proposed under the Other Vehicles in <1> are more stringent than those implemented in the oils used for oral and topical products. The atomic absorption spectroscopy tests for limit of copper, iron, lead, and nickel, referred to as trace metals in General Chapter <401>, were preferable to the method of General Chapter Heavy Metals <231>. The quantitative trace met-als test satisfied the accuracy requirements for much lower specification limits for parenteral products. If the oil had not been subjected to hydrogenation or if a nickel catalyst had not been used in processing, a note was included in the test for nickel stating that the test for nickel was not required, thus preventing unnecessary testing. For cottonseed oil and other vegetable oils that have paren- teral applications in drug formulations, the updated quality specifications in the Other Vehicles section in general chapter <1> were introduced and referenced in the fixed oil mono-graphs. Monograph labeling. A monograph's Labeling section may contain a labeling requirement to differentiate a specific grade or chemical composition of the excipient. If a highly purified fixed oil will be used in injectable dosage forms (i.e., qualified as a specific grade), this is indicated in the Labeling section. Additional quality specifications for the specific grade may be necessary and can be included in Other Requirements under the Additional Requirements section of the monograph.Reference Standards Table I: Excipient monographs that have \"oil\" in the titles and that fall under the responsibility of the excipients expert committee.

Fixed-oil excipients are used in a large number of drug products and are es-sential to product safety and performance. Thus, the suc-cessful manufacture of a robust product requires the use of well-defined excipients and processes that together yield consistent product quality. Typically, excipients are manu-factured and supplied to comply with compendial standards. USP-NF excipient monograph specifications are not des- ignated to explicitly test for material functionality, except for co-processed excipients (13). A greater understanding of the chemical composition and the physical and chemi-cal properties of excipients is necessary to set compendial specifications in USP-NF monographs. Based on a literature review, comparative analysis of com- pendial specifications for fixed oil articles in NF 23 , and studies of fixed oils using modern analytical technologies, USP staff and EM2 EC made the following recommenda-tions to modernize fixed-oil monographs: t\u0001Introduce identification tests that are specific for chemi- cal composition. A fingerprint or chemical profile\u2014not all components or constituents must be individually identified\u2014should be considered. Where possible, test for a greater number of nonoverlapping attributes by introducing a greater number of relatively simpler tests. In best cases, these tests can be performed orthogonally. Introduce tests that are generic and can be applied to most (if not all) fixed oils. t\u0001Introduce an oil chemical composition specification specific for relative compositional constituents such as fatty acids. t\u0001Introduce tests that identify and quantify the ingredi- ent itself (e.g., component triglycerides) rather than a surrogate. t\u0001Introduce specifications to identify natural or deliberate transformation and stability. These recommendations are discussed below.Recommendations for test procedures. EXC EC proposes sev- eral test and meth- odology to the greatest extent possible t\u0001Simplicity of procedure\u2014a greater number of individual simpler tests is preferable to a smaller number of tests whose methodology is more complex and challenging t\u0001Specificity\u2014any test or combination of tests must be able to uniquely identify the fixed oil and exclude the presence of other oils t\u0001Sufficient specificity to differentiate between an authen- tic fixed oil and an oil adulterated with the same oil of inferior quality t\u0001Preferably identify as well as assay a fixed oil using one method.Modernization strategy USP staff and EM2 EC have developed an analytical test plan to fulfill the current regulatory requirements and keep abreast of current industry developments. The analytical test plan for fixed oils is summarized in Table II and is presented in greater detail in the extended online version of this article (www.pharmtech.com/ USPfixedoil). The tests recommended in Table II are critical control measures that ensure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of fixed oils. Further explanation and rationale to justify these recommendations are presented below. Identification tests. Spectroscopic identification and labora- tory results. In the USP 2005-2010 revision cycle, USP staff and EM2 EC identified excipient monographs that lacked an identification test and recommended introducing an in-frared (IR) spectroscopy or similar spectroscopic identifica-tion test in preference to wet chemistry or colorimetric tests. Generally, spectroscopic procedures provide a good identi-fication for highly purified single-molecular compounds. The USP Research and Development laboratory performed suitability studies for inclusion of an IR identification test in several fixed-oil monographs such as cottonseed oil, olive oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, and soybean oil. The results indicated that IR could not be used as a suitable identifica-tion test for these fixed oils because their IR spectra were 106 Pharmaceutical Technology APRIL 2013 PharmTech.comindistinguishable from each other, and IR was unable to uniquely identify fixed oils by visual comparison because of the similarities in their functional groups. Furthermore, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was also considered; however, there were concerns related to cost, lack of NMR instruments in most quality-control labora-tories in industry, and a lack of personnel training for the NMR procedure. Fatty acid composition and melting range or temperature. Ideally, a robust specification should be independent of ge-netic modifications or seasonal or geographic variations that tend to change the composition of the substance over time and place. The fatty acid composition of a fixed oil, however, varies with natural, seasonal, and geographical changes. Thus, the specification commonly defines the wid-est possible compositional range that is acceptable from the viewpoints of safety, functionality, and effective extraction. Even so, the specification limits for the fatty acid composi-tion should be narrow enough so that there is reasonable assurance that the substance is pure, not adulterated, not processed improperly or incompletely, and suitable for its intended use.

EXC EC has worked with the General Chapters Chemical Analysis EC and the USP laboratory to propose a new general chapter, Identification of Fixed Oils by Thin-Layer Chromatography <202> (16). USP plans to release 11 USP Fixed Oil Reference Standards in support of <202> (16). USP's Dietary Supplements de-partment is planning to add three new fixed-oil dietary supplements to chapter <202> to support new monograph development. Unique patterns of TLC bands from specific triglycerides can distinguish fixed oils of different botanical origins, so it can be used orthogonally in conjunction with fatty acid composition. The procedure is harmonized with European Pharmacopoeia general chapter 2.3.2. Identification of Fixed Oils by Thin-Layer Chromatography (17). Assay. Content of Triglycerides. In recent decades, advances in chromatography and spectrometric methods (including mass spectrometry) have provided significant advancements in the understanding of complex excipient mixtures. Some fixed oils from different plant sources yield char- acteristic patterns with distinct triglycerides that predomi-nate (18). In many cases, the triglyceride pattern is more representative of the fixed oil identity than the fatty acid composition. This pattern can be determined with the help of HPLC or GC. A test for triglyceride composition based on an HPLC procedure using a refractive index detector was included in Sesame Oil NF in USP 28NF 23 (2005) (11). The test has an additional advantage because it can be performed on an intact sample, and it directly assesses the chemical composition of the oil and is recommended as an assay or composition test. If the test for triglyceride composition is introduced into fixed-oil monographs, it also can be used as a stand-alone identification test. High-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) is a useful analytical tool to identify and quantify triglycerides, diglycerides, Injectable Emulsion USP mono-graph, HPSEC is used to determine soybean oil or other relevant oils used in the emulsion. Reports indicated that all triglycerides from soybean oil or other relevant oils are eluted as one peak under the test conditions, without separa-tion. Although HPSEC cannot be used to differentiate fixed oils of different botanical origin, the amount of triglycerides in a fixed oil can be determined using the HPSEC proce-dure. Specific tests. Sterol composition. The composition of fatty acids traditionally has been used as an indicator of purity, although the wide variation in the composition of edible oils from different geographical origins or different cultivars is a limiting factor in the interpretation of data with regard to adulteration. Sterols, which comprise a major portion of the unsaponifiable matter, are found in almost all fats and fixed oils, and they also are characteristic of the authentic fixed oil. Sterols are highly specific for each oil source, and USP staff and EM2 EC recommended that the tests of fatty acid composition (from the saponifiable portion) and sterol com-position (from unsaponifiable matter) be used orthogonally for certain fixed oils to determine their identity and quality. Because of characteristic sterol profiles and the high eco-nomic values of almond oil and olive oil, comprehensive sterol composition specifications have been implemented in both monographs. The sterol composition specifications in soybean oil USP and corn oil NF serve to exclude any other contaminating oils such as canola oil when these fixed oils are manufactured in the same facilities. Test specifications. Iodine value, saponification value, and some other physical methods. Iodine value and saponifica- tion value tests are used to measure the degree of unsatura-tion and the relative proportions of fatty acids and glycerin in a sample, respectively. Introducing the fatty acid compo-sition test into the monograph makes the iodine value and saponification value tests redundant because both values can be estimated from the fatty acid composition profile. Therefore, when the fatty acid composition test is part of the specifications of a fixed-oil monograph, the iodine value and 108 Pharmaceutical Technology APRIL 2013 PharmTech.comsaponification value tests usually are not included or have been deleted from the monograph. Other physical tests. Other tests such as specific gravity and refractive index that previously were included in several fixed oil monographs have been moved into the Description and Solubility section of USP-NF for the fixed oils. With the proposed modernization for the fixed oils, these physical tests provide added optional assurance of identification and purity of the fixed oils. Conclusion As shown in Table III and in the extended online version, excip- ient monograph modernization is a continuing endeavor that requires a consistent approach within a family of excipients. Such an approach is necessary to streamline analytical testing across multiple monographs as well as to keep the number of specific analytical tests to a minimum. This decreases the analytical burden on industry and allows methods to be ref-erenced in monographs (e.g., from a general chapter). USP continues to update USPNF to provide standards for articles, including revised specifications based on ad-vances in analytical and metrological science. USP ECs also rely on stakeholders' and sponsors' comments to keep monographs current. Emerging methodologies such as car-bon number testing, C 13/C12 ratio testing, and chemometrics can be considered as they become commonly adopted by stakeholders.

IMAGE: STEVE ALLEN, GETTY IMAGESPharmaceutical Technology's an- nual equipment and manufactur-ing survey gained the industry's perspectives on trends in finished drug-product manufacturing and equipment. Respondents in both solid dosage and parenteral drug manufacturing were generally satisfied with the utility of ex-isting equipment and the pace of inno-vation in meeting manufacturing needs. Most employ quality by design (QbD) to some extent, but respondents identified a range of challenges in implementing QbD. Responses also indicated trends in high-potency/high-containment manu-facturing, process analytical technology (PAT), and continuous manufacturing. Solid-dosage equipment The survey showed that existing solid-dosage equipment is generally meeting needs. Areas noted by more than 20% of respondents as needing significant improvement, however, included pro-cess control/automation, powder trans-fer/materials handling, and feeding/dispensing (see Figure 1 ). When asked Evaluating Equipment Utility and Innovation Jennifer Markarianif innovation is keeping pace with cur- rent and future needs, responses were similar, with the same three areas in-dicated as lacking solutions by 20% or more of respondents. Tablet compres-sion stood out as a strongly innovative area, with 96% of respondents indicat-ing that innovation is \"excellent\" or \"good\" for this equipment. Parenteral equipment Users of parenteral equipment, likewise, are generally satisfied with existing equipment, as shown in Figure 2 . Pro- cess control/automation and vials/car-tridges fill-finish equipment, however, were two areas noted by 20% or more of respondents as needing significant im-provement. In all segments, nearly 80-90% of respondents said that the pace of innovation was \"good\" or \"excellent\". High-containment/ high-potency manufacturing Just over half of respondents that are involved in high-containment/high-potency manufacturing had seen an increase in activity in this area in the past year. Approximately one quarter of respondents said system setup/change-over was the most challenging factor in high-containment/high-potency manu-facturing, while another quarter identi-fied getting materials into or out of the contained system during production as the most challenging. Others identified air flow (10%), air-flow changes (10%), environmental most chal-lenging factor in high-containment/high-potency manufacturing. QbD Almost half of respondents indicated that their company applies QbD prin-ciples for both new and legacy products, and another 32% apply QbD to all or select new products (see Figure 3 ). Only 22% of respondents do not apply QbD at all. Approximately 72% identified better process understanding as a ben-efit of QbD. Participants were invited to choose all answers that applied, and they indicated other benefits of QbD Request a Catalog: perfex@perfexonline.com Spend Less. Demand More !

Only 6% of respondents felt that there are no challenges or barriers to implement-ing QbD. More than half noted lack of knowledge and training as a problem. Approximately 42% indicated clarity of regulatory guidance as a barrier. Only about one-third of repondents chose, respectively, lack of management buy in, availability of software, or avail-ability of equipment as barriers to QbD implementation. PAT Over half of respondents indicate that they use PAT, which is an increase from last year's survey that found only 40% of respondents incorporating PAT (1). When asked to indicate the primary drivers for using PAT (multiple answers permitted), nearly half of respondents chose increased efficiency/reduced waste; others chose better process under-standing (44%), reduced costs (33%), and shorter process times (31%). Almost 10% Respondents' profiles Pharmaceutical Technology's Equipment and Manufacturing Survey targeted individuals in production and engineering. The survey was conducted by email in February 2013 and had 193 respondents. Nearly 30% were from innovator phar maceutical companies, 28% from generic-drug companies, 20% from contract manufacturers, and 10% from consumer healthcare companies making over-the-counter products. The remaining respondents included excipient and raw material suppliers (7%) and equipment or machinery vendors (5%). About half of the respondents were involved with solid-dosage manufacturing and the other half in parenteral drug manufacturing. The majority of respondents (79%) were from companies with under $1 billion in revenue. Nearly 7% were from companies with between $1 to $10 billion in revenue, almost 7% were from companies with $10 to $50 billion in revenue, and the remainder (8%) were from companies with over $50 billion in revenue.

Sterile manufacturing/aseptic processing and lyophilization are areas of potentially strong growth for the use of PAT. As shown in Figure 4 , 14% of respondents in these areas use PAT now, but an additional 50% plan to implement PAT in the coming year. Compared to the other categories, a higher percentage in solid-dosage manufacturing (22-26%) already use PAT, but a lower percentage (24-25%) plan to add PAT in the com-ing year.Continuous manufacturing Continuous manufacturing is still a new technology, but is being considered as an alternative to traditional batch processes for solid-dosage manufactur-ing. Respondents indicated (multiple answers permitted) multiple barriers to implementing continuous processes, including: t\u0001 lack of equipment (46%) t\u0001 insufficient expertise (42%) o s t ( 3 6 % ) t\u0001 concern over regulatory acceptance (29%) t\u0001 insufficient PAT (23%) t\u0001 lack of appropriate documentation systems (15%). Nearly all agreed, however, that technology will continue to evolve and use of continuous processing will increase. Reference 1. P. Van Arnum, Pharm. Techol. 36 (4) 50-60 (2012).

In examining de-velopments from 2012 and 2013 to date, companies are proceeding with select investments to expand manufacturing capacity and enhance service capabilities. High-potency manufacturing continues to be an active area of investment among CMOs, and several CMOs also are ex-panding overall manufacturing capacity. Company activity Lonza, the bellwether of the contract API manufacturing sector, proceeded with several expansions in its small-molecule custom-manufacturing business in 2012. Earlier this year, Lonza reported that its custom manufacturing and bioscience sectors will be regrouped into one phar-maceutical market segments group. In 2012, Lonza completed the first two build-out phases of its large-scale multipurpose cGMP API plant in Nan-sha, China, following FDA approval of several customer projects in late 2011. Also, the company successfully brought on line a small-scale manufacturing train and a GMP kilo-laboratory in Nansha. The company's large-scale an-tibody drug conjugates project in Visp, Switzerland was finalized on schedule, and the plant received FDA approval in the third quarter of 2012. A second ex-pansion phase has started and will be finalized toward the end of the first half of 2014. Five additional high-potency API (HPAPI) laboratories in Visp, with capabilities for cytotoxic substances, are operational and utilized, and new investment in additional cytotoxic API manufacturing capacity in Visp was started up in 2012. Lonza also increased peptide-manufacturing capabilities at its site in Braine, Belgium. Other companies are proceeding with investments and alliances to build HPAPI capabilities. In 2012, Carbogen Amcis and ADC Biotechnology formed a partnership to provide customers with development and manufacturing services for antibody drug conjugates. ADC Bio will provide ac-cess to proprietary solid-phase immobiliza-tion technologies for conjugation and long-term storage of antibody drug conjugates. Carbogen Amcis will focus on small- to large-scale GMP supply and on the formu-lation of antibody drug conjugates. In October 2012, Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies formed a strategic al-liance with Piramal for antibody drug conjugate production, whereby the two companies will offer contract devel-opment and manufacture of antibody drug conjugates. Piramal offers anti-body drug conjugate production at its site in Grangemouth, Scotland. In 2012, Fujifilm also expanded its cGMP manu-facturing facilities at its sites in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina and Bill-ingham, United Kingdom. Novasep announced in 2012 a $3.9-million (EUR 3 million) invest- ment to expand its HPAPI manufac-turing capabilities at its facility in Le Mans, France. The plant expansion was scheduled to be fully operational by the beginning of 2013. In addition to its HPAPI capac- ity expansion, Novasep is investing EUR 30 million ( $39 million) to build a chromatography plant for the large-vol-ume production of commercial APIs. The plant is being built on Novasep's existing site in Mourenx, France and is expected to be operational and validated in 2014 . The new plant will contain Varicol con-tinuous chromatography systems with 1200-mm diameter columns operated at up to 70 bars. Other developments Several companies have announced overall manufacturing capacity ad-ditions. For example, Albemarle is ex-panding its manufacturing facility in Tyrone, Pennsylvania. The $30-million expansion builds on an earlier expan-sion that began operations in November 2012, which will result in an eventual 40% increase in reactor capacity for the company's custom-manufacturing busi-ness. The first increment of new capac-ity will be operational late in the first quarter of 2014. In February 2013, Pharma Zell added an additional manufacturing site to its European manufacturing network. The company acquired a manufacturing Fine-Chemical Producers Make Targeted Investments Contract API manufacturers proceed with select investment in capacit y and service additions. High-potency manufacturing remains an active area of investment among CMOs.Patricia Van ArnumPharmaceutical Technology APRIL 2013 115Inside Informex site in Liestal, Switzerland previously operated by AbbVie (formerly Abbott). Abbott's pharmaceutical business was spun off in a separate company, AbbVie, in January 2013. The Liestal site consists of multipurpose manufactur-ing equipment with 150 m 3 of reactor volume with drying and milling ca-pacity, packaging cleanrooms, a pilot plant, quality-control laboratories, and warehouses for manufacturing small-molecule, large-volume APIs. In 2012, Almac expanded its API manufacturing facility at its European headquarters in Craigavon, United Kingdom, with a scheduled completion for the end of 2012. The upgrade in-cluded installation of two 1000-L reac-tors and a pressure-filter dryer, which allows production of GMP APIs up to 150-kg batches. In September 2012, Cambridge Major Laboratories (CML) reported that it is expanding its large-scale API manufac-turing facility in Germantown, Wiscon-sin. The expansion comes three years after commissioning the new site. The expansion includes additional reactor capacity and isolation equipment as well as additional investments in engineer-ing controls. Also, in 2012, Cedarburg Hauser Pharmaceuticals expanded its capacity at its Wisconsin-based API manufacturing plant and made addi-tional upgrades for improving safety and GMP systems. Other companies are making tar- geted investment in select manufactur-ing activities. In 2012, Dr. Reddy's Cus-tom Pharmaceutical Services expanded its activated mPEG manufacturing ca-pabilities at is facility in Mirfield, United Kingdom. SAFC, part of Sigma-Aldrich, is expanding its operations in Scotland by investing in the development of a new powder-manufacturing facility at its Ir-vine site. SAFC's new facility in Irvine is its second powder manufacturing fa-cility, which will support SAFC's risk- management program, which provides an internal back-up supplier for its cus-tomers. The new facility will be used to serve customers across Europe. Almac and DSM Pharmaceutical Products recently reported the suc-cessful transfer of enzymes for en- zyme screening, process development and scale-up as part of the companies' agreement in biocatalysis, which was announced in October 2012. The agree-ment grants both companies access to their enzyme platform technologies and services for the manufacturing of APIs. The collaboration also enables Almac to offer its customers a preferred partner for large-scale production. In February 2013, DSM Pharmaceu- tical Products signed an agreement with Chemtrix, a supplier of flow-chemistry equipment and services, for providing equipment, development and manufacturing services to the pharma-ceutical industry. Chemtrix specializes in ready-to-use laboratory and kilo-scale microreactors as well as reactor and process design for industrial re-actors.

DSM has FDA approval for using microreactors for making a phar-maceutical product at commercial scale under cGMP at its facility in Linz, Austria, where its dedicated commer-cial-scale installation is located. The DSM-Chemtrix col-laboration will initially offer an industrial flow process- development package for customized scalable flow-chemistry solutions. The package covers all phases of process design, scanning chemistries, chemistry develop-ment, route scouting, equipment design, and scale-up for fully continuous or integrated processes. Ajinomoto plans to invest approximately JPY 1.3 billion ($13.9 million) to double production capacity for amino acids for use in pharmaceuticals and foods at its subsid-iary Shanghai Ajinomoto Amino Acid in Shanghai. The expansion is scheduled to come on line in October 2013. Ajinomoto estimates the current global market for amino acids for pharmaceuticals and foods at 30,000 tons, and with growth in emerging markets, expects demand to rise to 45,000 tons by 2020. Several fine-chemical producers and contract API pro- ducers also recently announced activity in support of fin-ished product manufacturing. For example, earlier this year, Ajinomoto agreed to acquire Althea Technologies, a San Diego-based contract provider of fill-finish services. Aesica and the CDMO EmulTech are partnering on the commercial development of ET4ME, an emulsion technology for product formulation. ET4ME is a microencapsulation technology that uses a microfluidic process to create a measurable mi-croparticulate suspension. The technology can be used for small molecules and biologics. Cambrex agreed to contract manufacture Dow Chemi- cal's hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, an excipient provided by Dow as part of a solubilization part-nership that Dow and Bend Research formed in 2012 under which Dow is commercially supplying solubility-enabling excipients. Cambrex has begun construction of the new fa-cility at Cambrex's site in Karlskoga Sweden with commer-cial product availability set for year end 2013. In another development, ScinoPharm and Foresee Pharmaceuticals agreed to form a joint venture to develop a series of peptide injectable drugs, with the first being a leuprolide injectable drug product, by which leuprolide will be formulated in a proprietary controlled-release drug delivery system originally developed by Foresee and transferred to the joint venture. ScinoPharm is investing $3.6 million for a minority ownership in the new company. PTAlbemarle is investing $30 million in its custom-manufacturing facility.

As industry economics change and products lose pat-ent protection, companies have been faced with the problem of reducing or eliminat-ing the costs of underutilized facilities. Further, because of their heightened at-tention to risk and the need to conserve capital for licensing deals and acquisitions, bio/pharmaceutical companies want to avoid making manufacturing investments whenever possible. Typically, companies have pursued two paths for dealing with their capacity utilization problem: closing or divesting unnecessary facilities, or going to into the CMO business as a way of absorbing the capacity. Facility closures are the most direct approach and are relatively straightfor-ward to accomplish in North America, but they are more difficult in Europe because of social regulations and nega-tive publicity. In both Europe and North America, divesting the facility to another bio/pharmaceutical company or to a con-tract manufacturer has been a viable alter-native. This approach has its drawbacks: the sale process can be long and drawn out, and in a few extreme cases, the bio/pharmaceutical company has been forced to take back the facility when the CMO option has proven not to be viable to safe-guard product supply. Where an underutilized facility still has strategic value, the bio/pharmaceuti-cal company may seek to sell the excess capacity in the contract manufacturing market. This typically has marginal ben- efit, however, as the bio/pharmaceutical company seldom allocates the necessary resources to the business and is so selec-tive about the projects it will take that it signs very few deals. Strategic alternative In recent months, two bio/pharmaceuti-cal companies have announced a new and more innovative approach that may be a much better alternative to closure, divestiture, or contract manufacturing. Eisai and Biogen Idec have established a strategic partnership that they believe can serve as a model for manufacturing capac-ity management for the bio/pharmaceuti- cal industry. Under the terms of the agreement, which became operational on Feb. 1, 2013, Biogen Idec is leasing part of an Eisai solid-dose manufacturing facility in Re-search Triangle Park, N.C. (RTP), and is manufacturing oral solid-dose products for itself and for Eisai in the leased facil-ity. In a parallel arrangement, Eisai will fill and finish Biogen Idec biologics products at its injectable manufacturing facility in RTP, as well as package the oral solid-dose products. The 10-year lease agreement gives Bio- gen Idec the option to purchase the Eisai solid-dose facility. Approximately 50 Eisai personnel have moved to Biogen Idec to support the solid-dose manufacturing. The partnership grew out of the con- fluence of challenges that the two com-panies were facing. Eisai had to address the utilization problem at its solid-dose facility as its Alzheimer's treatment Ari-cept approached loss of exclusivity, said Lou Arp, general manager of Eisai's RTP manufacturing site and president of global oncology manufacturing. For its part, Biogen Idec needed to bring small mol-ecule capability in-house and add more capability to its supply chain to reduce risk, according to Machelle Sanders, vice-president of manufacturing and general manager of its RTP manufacturing site. Solid-dose products are new territory for Biogen Idec, which has traditionally fo-cused on biologics. The two companies were familiar with each other's capabilities and culture well before their discussions began. For one, their two facilities are located in close Strategic Partnering for Manufacturing Eisai and Biogen Idec pursue an innovative approach to capacit y management. Eisai and Biogen Idec have established a strategic partnership that they believe can serve as a model for manufacturing capacity management.Jim Miller Jim M iller is president of PharmSource Information Ser vices, Inc., and publisher of Bio/Pharmaceutical Outsourcing Report , tel. 703.383.4903, Twitter@JimPharmSource, info@pharmsource.com, www .pharmsource.com.COUNT ON USSM Work with the leaders at bringing semi-solids and liquids to life. www.dptlabs.com FRO M NON-STERI LE TO STERI TO FRO V IRTUA L TO LARGE PHARMA With a speciali zed focus on semi-solids and liquids since 1938, DPT offers the broadest range of capabilities in the industr y, along with an outstanding regulator y histor y.

In addi- tion, both have been involved in a manu-facturing group within The North Caro-lina Biosciences Organization and have benchmarked each other's best practices as part of that group. Both Sanders and Arp say that their partnership is truly strategic and different from a traditional CMO deal. They de-scribe it as a \"reciprocal and co-dependent relationship,\" in which issues that arise will have to be handled consistently for both parties. So, for instance, the way in which Biogen Idec resolves a problem in the man-ufacture of an oral solid-dose product for Eisai will be reflected in (or reflective of) how Eisai handles a similar problem in the manufacture of injectable products for Biogen Idec. The sometimes-adversarial relationship that can arise in a traditional CMO-client relationship can't be tolerated in their partnership, they contend.As one might expect, governance will be a key to success in the partnership. The two companies have established a joint steering committee consisting of three representatives and director-level leader-ship from each. Manufacturing, engineer-ing, and quality professionals are included on the committee. Both Sanders and Arp maintain that the compatibility of their corporate cul-tures will be the central factor for the partnership's success. \"Finding the right partner with the right values\" was crucial in establishing the relationship, and the fact that they are both mid-size compa-nies able to be flexible and nimble is also important. Mixed sourcing strategy For both Biogen Idec and Eisai, the new manufacturing partnership is part of a sourcing strategy in which both inter-nal capacity and CMO relationships are key components. Biogen Idec has tra-ditionally outsourced its fill-and-finish requirements while maintaining its own large molecule API manufacturing fa-cilities. While it will manufacture its own products at the leased Eisai facility, it has also outsourced the manufacture of a new solid-dose product in its pipeline. Eisai plans to continue to invest in its injectables capabilities to support its own pipeline, and sees the additional volume from Biogen Idec as helping to justify the additional investment. However, Eisai will use CMOs where appropriate: it recently announced a three-year master supply agreement with DSM Pharmaceutical Products for manufacture of eribulin mesylate (Halaven) at DSM's Greenville, N.C., injectables manufacturing facility. Whether the partnership between Bio- gen Idec and Eisai is just a one-off event or becomes a model for the industry re-mains to be seen. It may be that unique factors like geographic proximity, inter-personal dynamics, and complementary needs facilitated an innovative approach that may be hard to duplicate. Or it may be that having seen this example of a new partnership approach, other bio/phar-maceutical companies start looking for innovative alternatives to addressing their manufacturing requirements.

After all, we were all taught at college or university that only two rules are needed. Rule 1: If the digit after the figure to be rounded is less than 5, then don't change the rounded figure (i.e., round down). Rule 2: If the digit after the figure to be rounded is 5 or more, then increase figure to be rounded by 1 (i.e., round up). Simple really, isn't it? After all, the United States Pharmacopeia (USP ) re- quires the use of just this method: When rounding is required, consider only one digit in the decimal place to the right of the last place in the limit expression. If this digit is smaller than 5, it is eliminated and the preceding digit is unchanged. If this digit is equal to or greater than 5, it is eliminated and the preceding digit is increased by 1 (1). Of course, rounding only takes place after the final calculation has been performed. The USP General Notices make this requirement clear: Numbers should not be rounded until the final calculations for the reportable value have been completed. Intermedi-ate calculations (e.g., slope for linear-ity) may be rounded for reporting pur-poses, but the original (not rounded) value should be used for any additional required calculations (1).How to obtain unbiased roundingChris BurgessRounding Results for Comparison with Specification Chris Bur gess, PhD, is an analytical scientist at Burgess Analytical Consultancy Limited, 'Rose Rae, ' The Lendings 1: Decision tree for an unbiased rounding process. Truncate the value to one more than the # ofdecimal places to be rounded to (Designate the figure to be rounded X, the one to be dropped Y and the difference from the full figure and the truncated value to be Z) Apply rule 1 Is Y 4 or less?

From a statistical point of view, applying rule 2 will bias the data over time because one will always round up particularly if 5 is frequently the figure to be rounded. 4 and below and 6 and above are balanced in rounding but what about 5? It has been known for more than 60 years that applying only rules 1 and 2 will cause biased data. What is even more interesting is that the third rule was well known at that time, at least to statisticians. Sadly, this rule is rarely if ever mentioned in modern text books and guidelines. The purpose of this column is to resurrect this \"forgotten\" rul e beca use th e n eed f o r s im p li ci ty d oes n o t tak e precedence over scientific correctness. In any event, rule 3 is not hard to understand and is merely buried in older text-books and standards. Three rules for rounding The best explanation of unbiased rounding is in a 1947 textbook written by the statistical research group of Columbia University (2). The senior editor, Churchill Eisenhart from the (then) National Bureau of Standards, was one of the most influential statisticians of his era. Here are the three rules:Rule 1: If the last digit to be dropped is less than 5, the last digit retained shall be left unchanged. Rule 2: If the last digit to be dropped is greater than 5, or is 5 followed by digits greater than 0, the last digit retained shall be increased by 1.Rule 3: If the last digit to be dropped is 5 alone or a 5 followed by 0 only, the last digit retained shall be rounded to the nearest even number. It is usually easier to see how such a rule works if you draw it in a decision tree as shown in Figure 1 . In this figure, we designate the digit or figure to be rounded by X, the digit Table I: Results from Excel 2010 with four examples.

YOUR NEEDS ARE OUR PRIORITY See us at INTERPHEX, Booth 3956The need for simplicity does not take precedence over scientific correctness.124 Pharmaceutical Technology APRIL 2013 PharmTech.comStatistical Solutions or figure to be dropped by Y, and the difference between the truncated value and the full figure value by Z. Based upon the values of X, Y, and Z, we can arrive at the correct unbiased rounding decision. Examples We can now test our unbiased round-ing process with four examples. 1. Round with 7 significant figures to 2 decimal places. 3.141Truncate 593 Z XY Rule 1 gives the answer 'Yes,' so round down to 3.14. 2. Round energy (E) with 7 significant figures to 2 decimal places. 2.718Truncate 282 Z XY Rule 1 gives the answer 'No' and the rule 2 answer is 'Yes,' so round up to 2.72. 3. Round 0.005051 to 2 decimal places. 0.005Truncate 051 Z XY Rules 1 and 2 both give the answer 'No,' therefore, rule 3 is invoked. As Z > 0, rule 3 answer is 'No,' so round up to 0.01. 4. Round 0.005000 to 2 decimal places. 0.005Truncate 000 Z XY Rules 1 and 2 both give the answer 'No,' therefore, rule 3 is invoked. As Z=0, rule 3 answer is 'Yes' and the digit before X is even, therefore, round down to 0.00. The last example may give rise to surprise because by the simple rules it would be deemed incorrect. However, it would be unlikely to find such an example in analysis unless the method is only capable of giving rise to 5 or 0 for Y. Rounding using Microsoft Excel Many laboratories use Microsoft Excel for calculations, so it is interesting to see how it performs with the four ex-amples. Excel has three rounding func-tions\u2014round, round down, and round up. In each function, it is necessary to specify the number to be rounded and the number of decimal places required. The results from Excel 2010 for the ex-amples to 2 decimal places are shown in Table I . The incorrect rounded val- ues are highlighted in yellow. The round function works well with the exception of example 4. However, Excel can be easily programmed to perform a unbiased rounding decision tree automatically. Suppose the values to be rounded are put starting in cell C9 and the number of decimal places to be rounded to in cell E9. Excel's 'trunc' function can be used to extract the values of X, Y and Z; using the formulae: For X = Z = $C9-TRUNC( $C9,$E9+1). These values of X, Y and Z are stored in the relevant rows (9 to 12) of columns G, H, and I. The rounding calculation formula (a nested \"if\" formula) is now placed in cell J9 for the first example and copied down for rows 10, 11, and 12 for the others: =IF($H9<=4,ROUNDDOWN( $C9, $E9),IF($H9>=5,IF(AND( $H9>=5,$I9 >0),ROUNDUP( $C9,$E9),ROUNDD OWN($C9,$E9)))) The Excel results of the unbiased rounding formula are shown in Table II and agree with the manual evaluation for the four examples. The mysteries of rounding are exposed here and strict unbiased rounding can be applied. References 1. USP 35, General Notices 7.20, \"Rounding Rules\" (US Pharmacopeial MD, 2012). 2. C. Hastay, W.A.

These regulations (6) are designed to combat abuse arising in the course of public procurement of medicines in connection with combining several INN (international nonproprietary na mes) within one lot, especially for cases where the lot contains a certain drug for which exclusive vertical agreement with distributor was made. For example, the distributor may purchase the whole lot of an innovated drug for a maximum price without having any competition at all. Advertising and other means of control Another important issue is the advertising of medicines and medical products. Recently, this subject has been brought up for discussion during parliament hearings of the Committee on protecting the health of State Duma of the Russian Federation. Plans for implementing stringent provisions on advertising medicines have been announced more than once on the level of Russian Government and State Duma. FAS clarified, in one of its letters issued in the summer of 2012, the current ban for advertising of prescription medicines and the respective exceptions for advertising on the Internet. Discussions are currently underway on how the advertising of medicines and medical products should become more regulated. Conclusion In conclusion, there is an escalation of public control and regulation affecting the pharmaceutical industry in Russia. Such escalation highlights the necessity to bring the industry to the highest international standards, regulate uncontrolled market growth, protect competition, and ensure compliance with international practice, so that the Russian market will appear favorable to foreign investors in view of the country's WTO accession last year. However, there is concern that legislators may have missed the fact that stricter governmental control over the industry could also have a negative effect because market access will become more difficult and perhaps impossible for foreign and domestic SMEs or new market players.

Q.How will the new FDASIA user fees a ffect inspections ? A.On Ju ly 9, 2012, Pres ident O bama s igned into law the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA). This legislation passed both the House and Senate with overwhelming bipartisan majorities, signifying an effective, cooperative legislatio n process that included FDA, Congress, patients, doctors, and the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The legislation is intended to provide FDA with added resources and authorities required to bring drugs and devices to market safely and quickly and promote innovation in the biomedical industry. In addition to the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA V) and the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA III), it authorizes user fees for generic drugs and biosimilars. The Act establishes new initiatives, requirements, and authorities in other key areas as well and is certainly worth a careful study by its stakeholders. The legislation includes explicit provisions relating to inspections but, in addition, it is important to understand the commitments made by FDA during the legislation negotiation time that will also drive implementation. When viewed collectively, I believe that the greatest impact of the new legislation to inspections will be in the area of generic drugs. The Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA), Title III of FDASIA, authorizes the agency to collect user fees to supplement the agency's cost for conducting human generic-drug activities. Unlike the legacy user fee acts, GDUFA specifically defines covered FDA activities to include facility inspections. FDA has committed to conducting risk-adjusted biennial CGMP surveillance inspections of generic API and generic finished dosage form (FDF) manufacturers, with the goal of achieving parity of inspection frequency between foreign and domesticfirms in fiscal year (FY) 2017. One of the specific provisions in GDUFA is the requirement for sites to self-identify, which will provide FDA with a more complete and up-to-date inventory of generic-drug establishments. With a better inventory of generic-drug establishments, the ability to allocate user fees to conduct inspections, a mandateto achieve inspection frequency parity among domestic and foreign establishments, a mandate for FDA to annually report year-to-year inspection metrics, and newly defined risk factors that include time since the last inspection, compliance history, and inherent product risk (see FDASIA Section 705), FDA is poised to significantly escalate the number of generic-drug inspections worldwide. This legislation also provides FDA with additional authorities that facilitate and augment its inspection program: t\u0001Under FDASIA Section 706, drug establishments must provide FDA, upon request, any records FDA would be entitled to obtain during an on-site inspection t\u0001Under FDASIA Section 707, drugs will be deemed misbranded if a drug establishment delays, denies, or limits an inspection, or refuses to permit entry or inspection t\u0001Under FDASIA Section 712, FDA may rely upon the inspections of capable foreign government agencies and may protect information received from foreign government agencies from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FDASIA Section 70 8) t\u0001Under FDASIA Section 71 8, there is now extraterritorial jurisdiction over any violation of the law if the drug or other regulated article was intended for import into the United States or if any act in furtherance of the violation was committed in the US. PTThe Effect of FDASIA on Inspections The greatest impact of the new legislation to inspections will be in the area of generic drugs. Your o pinion ma tters.
