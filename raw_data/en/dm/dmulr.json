Introduction KanCare is a managed care Medicaid program which serves the State of Kansas through a coordinated approach. The State determined that contracting with multiple managed car e organizations will result in the provision of efficient and effective health care services to the populations covered by the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in Kansas and will ensure coordination of care and integration of physical and behavioral health services with each other and with home and community - based services. On August 6, 2012, the State of Kansas submitted a Medicaid Section 1115 demonstration proposal, entitled KanCare. That request was approved by the Centers for Me dicare and Medicaid Services on December 27, 2012, effective from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2017. The State submitted a one-year temporary extension request of this demonstration to CMS on July 31, 2017. The temporary extension was approved on October 13, 2017 . On December 20, 2017, the State submitted an extension request for its Medicaid 1115 demonstration. On December 18, 2018 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved a renewal of the Medicaid Section 1115 demonstration proposal entitled KanCare . The demonstration is effective from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2023. KanCare is operating concurrently with the state's section 1915(c) Home and Community -Based Services (HCBS) waivers, which together provide the authority necessary for the state to require enrollment of almost all Medicaid beneficiaries (including the aged, disab led, and some dual eligibles) across the state into a managed care delivery system to receive state plan and waiver services. This represents an expansion of the state's previous managed care program, which provided services to children, pregnant women, an d parents in the state's Medicaid program, as well as carved out managed care entities that separately covered mental health and substance use disorder services. KanCare also includes a safety net care pool to support certain hospitals that incur uncompens ated care costs for Medicaid beneficiaries and the uninsured, and to provide incentives to hospitals for programs that result in delivery system reforms that enhance access to health care and improve the quality of care. This five -year demonstration will: Maintain Medicaid state plan eligibility; Maintain Medicaid state plan benefits; Continue to allow the state to require eligible individuals to enroll in managed care organizations (MCOs) to receive covered benefits th rough such MCOs, including individuals on HCBS waivers, except: o American Indian/Alaska Natives are presumptively enrolled in KanCare but will have the option of affirmatively opting -out of managed care. Provide benefits, including long -term services and supports (LTSS) and HCBS, via managed care; Extend the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment program; and Design and implement an alternative payment model (APM) program to replace the DSRIP program Maintain the Safety Net Care Pool to support hospitals that provide uncompensated care to Medicaid beneficiaries and the uninsured. Increase beneficiary access to substance use disorder (SUD) treatment services. Provide work opportunities and supports for individuals with specific behavioral health conditi ons and other disabilities. The KanCare demonstration will assist the state in its goals to: Continue to provide integration and coordination of care across the whole spectrum of health to include physical health, behavioral health, and LTSS/HCBS; Furth er improve the quality of care Kansas Medicaid beneficiaries receive through integrated care coordination and financial incentives paid for performance (quality and outcomes); KanCare Third Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 09.30.2021 3 Maintain Medicaid cost control by emphasizing health, wellness, prevention, and early detection as well as integration and coordination of care; Continue to establish long -lasting reforms that sustain the improvements in quality of health and wellness for Kansas Medicaid beneficiaries and provide a model for other states for Medicaid payment and delivery system reforms as well; Help Kansas Medicaid beneficiaries achieve healthier, more independent lives by coordinating services to strengthen social determinants of health and independence and person -centered planning; Promote higher levels of member independence through employment programs; Drive performance and improve quality of care for Kansas Medicaid beneficiaries by integrating value - based models, purchasing strategies and quality improvement programs; and Improve effectiveness and efficiency of the state Medicaid program with increased alignment of MCO operations, data analytic capabilities and expanded beneficiary access to SUD services . This quarterly report is submitted pursuant to item #64 of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Special Terms and Conditions (STCs) issued regarding the KanCare 1115(a) Medicaid demonstration program, and in the format outlined in Attachment A of t he STCs.

The program was launched on April 1, 2020, with an expansion implemented on April 1, 2021.

Additionally, there are ongoing, monthly learning opportunities available to the provider network, including bi- monthly learning collaboratives and community of practices.

Information related to ABHKS marketing, outreach , and advocacy activities: Marketing Activities Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, ABHKS has continued to have issues with effectively providing outreach and marketing activities. Because of social distancing and policies against travel to stop the spread of the virus, the ability to communicate directly with KanCare members has been dramatically impacted. ABHKS has been working to communicate with community -based organizations and provider offices virtually since mid -March of 2020 and has seen varying results. ABHKS has been able to work with more organizations and events in person during the third quarter, but most efforts were virtual. In -person visits did increase in July.

KanCare Third Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 09.30.2021 22 e. Quality of care: Please see Section IX \"Quality Assurance/Monitoring Activity\" below. The HCBS Quality Review Report for January -March 2021 is attached to this report. f. Changes in provider qualifications/standards: None. g. Access: As noted in previous reports, members who are not in their open enrollment period are unable to change plans without a good cause reason (GCR) pursuant to 42 CFR 438.56 and the KanCare STCs. Most GCR reques ts were related to provider choice, which is not an acceptable reason to switch plans outside of open enrollment. If a GCR is denied by KDHE, the member is given appeal/fair hearing rights. There were two state fair hearing requests received for denied GC Rs from July - September 2021, and the two denied GCRs were upheld. A summary of third quarter GCR action follows: Status July August September Total GCRs filed 34 19 23 Approved 1 1 2 Denied 25 12 17 Withdrawn (resolved, no need to change) 0 2 0 Dismissed (due to inability to contact the member) 8 4 4 Pending 0 0 0 Providers are constantly added to the MCOs' networks, with much of the effort focused upon HCBS service providers . The counts below represent the unique number of NPIs \u2014or, where the NPI is not available \u2014provider name and service locations (based on the KanCare county designation identified in the KanCare Code Guide). This results in counts for the following: Providers with a service location in a Kansas county are counted once for each county. Providers with a service location in a border area are counted once for each state in which they have a service location that is within 50 miles of the KS border. Provi ders for services provided in the home are counted once for each county in which they are contracted to provide services. KanCare MCO # of Unique Providers as of 12/31/2020 # of Unique Providers as of 3/31/2021 # of Unique Providers as of 6/30/2021 # of Unique Providers as counts reflect revisions subsequent to annual audit and other meetings with MCOs that occurred in Quarter 4, 2020. h. Payment rates: Payment rates were updated to reflect utilization experience from January 1, 2018 - December 31, 2019 and to reflect policy changes ( see Section IV. Operational Developments/Issues, a. Systems and reporti ng issues, approval and contracting with new plans ). i. Health plan financial performance that is relevant to the demonstration: All KanCare MCOs remain solvent. j. Managed Long- Term Services and Supports ( MLTSS ) implementation and operation: Kansas placed 158 people on HCBS IDD waiver services, and 410 people on HCBS PD waiver services. KanCare Third Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 09.30.2021 23 k. DSRIP was replaced with a Bridge Gap Year from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. The State is using \u00a7438.6(c)(1)(iii)(B) to provide a uniform percentage increase to contracted rates between the large public teaching hospitals and border city children's hospitals and the MCOs for inpatient and outpatient hospital services provided in CY2021. As a conditio n of receiving the uniform increase on inpatient and outpatient utilization, the covered hospitals will be required to report the following metrics to KDHE on a quarterly basis, as these measures will inform the State's development of an APM directed payment: (1) Number of flu vaccinations administered by age; (2) Hospital -specific counts for emergency room visits; (3) Lung Cancer Screenings with low dosage CT (Large Public Teaching Hospital); (4) Number of hospitals or clinics contacted regarding diabetes protocols and number of diabetes protocols received and reviewed; the protocols will not be distributed; and (5) Hospital -specific reporting to support the evaluation of the directed payment. The preprint for the Bridge Gap Year was approved on March 31, 2021. No Bridge Gap year payments were made in the third quarter. l. Information on any issues regarding the concurrent 1915(c) waivers and on any upcoming 1915(c) waiver changes (amendments, expirations, renewals): The State continues to work with CMS rega rding amendments to the seven HCBS waivers, including amendments to performance measures, unbundling Assistive Services, and provisional plans of care. The State is participating in technical assistance offered through CMS. The State has begun the review and analysis of the SED and Autism waivers in preparation for their renewal scheduled for April of 2022. m. Legislative activity: The Kansas Legislature adjourned Sine Die on May 26, 2021 and will reconvene on January 10, 2022. In the meantime, KDADS presented to several interim legislative committees including the Kansas Senior Care Task Force, Special Committee on Child Welfare System Oversight, Special Committee on Home and Community Based Services Intellectual and Developmental Disability Waiver, Legislative Budget Committee, and the 2021 Special Committee on Mental Health Modernization and Reform. Topics included Nursing Homes, HCBS Programs, the plan submitted to CMS for the 10% HCBS FMAP enhancement, Mental Health Programs, State Hospitals, and Budget updates. Specific issues covered were types of Adult Care Facilities, HCBS rebalancing, HCBS reimbursement rates, HCBS waiting lists and eligibility requirements, HCBS provider network and workforce issues, Behavioral Health Services for youth, the 988 Hotline, and the timeline for Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics ( CCBHCs ). The Robert G. (Bob) Bethell Joint Committee on Home and Community Based Services and KanCare Oversight met September 22 -23, 2021. The Committee heard presentations from individuals, providers, and organizations related to KanCare, KDHE and KDADS. KDADS presented information on the four state hospitals and Nursing Facilities (NFs) including staffing levels, antipsychotic drugs, and nursing facility receiverships. KDADS also provided updates on the HCBS waiting lists, HCBS Final Rule, the plan submit ted to CMS for the 10% HCBS FMAP enhancement, the PACE Program, and PRTFs. Much of the focus during the 2021 legislative session was on Behavioral Health. CCBHCs are coming to Kansas, in addition to 988 call center services and mobile crisis. The Committ ee also heard updates from the KanCare Ombudsman and the Medicaid Inspector General. Each MCO also provided information about their operations. KDHE leadership presented their respective updates during The Robert G. (Bob) Bethell Joint Committee meeting. Dr. Lee Norman, Secretary of KDHE, covered personnel changes and vacancies, COVID -19 school guidance, and gave a COVID -19 update, which included: hot spot counties, KDHE's support of Local Health Departments , and a snapshot of upcoming scheduled KanCare Third Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 09.30.2021 24 COVID -19 v accination clinics. Sarah Fertig, State Medicaid Director, gave a KanCare program update , which included: recent audits, The American Rescue Plan Act, and the protected income limit. Additionally, she provided updates on HCAIP, OneCare Kansas, The Disability and Behavioral Health Employment Support Pilot (STEPS) Program, KanCare COVID -19 update, KanCare analytics and performance metrics, MCO financial review, and the KanCare executive summary. Christiane Swartz, Director of Medicaid Operations, gave update s on eligibility update, Medicaid eligibility applications, KDHE Clearinghouse staffing, and KDHE's transition plan toward the end of the PHE. Because of the Families First Coronavirus Act, KDHE eligibility workers continue to delay annual reviews in order to provide continuous coverage for current enrollees during the PHE. The only exceptions for eligibility discontinuation are if the member no longer a Kansas resident, dies, or voluntarily withdraws from the Medicaid program. This process will remain in place for Kansas to continue to receive the enhanced federal share of 6.2% for Medicaid and an increase of 4.34% for CHIP through the termination of the PHE. Overview of other changes made to the Medicaid program during the PHE: Applicants and benefic iaries have an additional 120 days to request a fair hearing, if the original 33 -day deadline falls between March 2020 and the end of the PHE Remove all cost sharing for testing/treatment of COVID -19 for KanCare members Allow for greater flexibility of day service locations for HCBS members Services can be rendered in home by a family member, with reimbursement to the family member Allow for out of state, non -KanCare providers to provide services in Kansas Suspend PASRR Level 1 and Level 2 requirements for 30 days Temporarily cease all physical visits from MCOs to providers/members Allow for early refill of maintenance prescriptions; increase level of pharmacy delivery, and mail order availability Temporarily allow for documented verbal consent on person -centered plans of care Providers are regularly updated through the Kansas Medical Assistance Program (KMAP) website of changes made to the program. A special page titled \"COVID -19 KMAP Providers Information Page 2\" was added to assist providers as a 'one -stop location' for bulletins, phone numbers, and links to online resources. n. Other Operational Issues: Eligibility workers returned to an alternative work schedule in early September. Staff work from home and in the office on alternate days and tim es to control the spread of COVID -19. Guidance remains in place for wearing masks, social distancing, following good hygiene , and limiting the gathering of large groups where social distancing cannot be maintained while in the office. This effort has resu lted in keeping staff safe and enable s Medicaid applications to be processed timely. 2 https://www.kmap -state -ks.us/Documents/Content/Provider/COVID%2019%20.pdf KanCare Third Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 09.30.2021 25 V. Policy Developments/Issues General Policy Issues : Kansas addressed policy concerns related to MCOs and state requirements through weekly KanCare Policy Committee, monthly KanCare Steering Committee, and monthly joint and one -on- one meetings between KDHE, KDADS and MCO leadership. Policy changes are also communicated to MCOs through other scheduled and ad hoc meetings as necessary to ensure leadership and program staff are aware of the changes. All policies affecting the operation of the Kansas Medicaid program and MMIS are addressed through a defined and well- developed process that is inclusive (obtaini ng input from and receiving review by user groups, all affected business areas, the state Medicaid policy team, the state's fiscal agent and Medicaid leadership) and results in documentation of the approved change. VI. Financial/Budget Neutrality Development /Issues Budget neutrality: The State has updated the Budget Neutrality template provided by CMS and has submitted this through the PMDA system. The expenditures contained in the document reconcile to Schedule C from the CMS 64 report for quarter ending 9/30/2021. General reporting issues: KDHE continues to work with Gainwell Technologies, the fiscal agent, to modify reports as needed to have all data required in an appropriate format for efficient Section 1115 demonstration reporting.

KanCare Third Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 09.30.2021 28 VIII. Consumer Issues A summary of the consumer issues is below: Issue Resolution Action Taken to Prevent Further Occurrences Consumers on the HCBS Brain Injury (BI) Waiver were having difficulties locating therapy providers. The State worked with all three MCOs to ensure that those who had reached out received assistance in locating the needed providers. The State worked with all three MCOs to ensure that all BI Waiver consumers will receive their needed therapies and will receive assistance in locating those providers. There have been recent concerns with Nursing Facilities either taking an inappropria te Patient Liability amount or not including additional payments received from additional insurances. The State worked closely with the MCO(s) specific to the submitted concerns to ensure any billing/refunds that needed processed would be completed and the correct amount was paid by the consumer. The State ensured that billing was a topic of discussion during the All MCO quarterly training. This training was available to all providers and was presented via WebEx. The following chart contains the quarterly results from HCBS consumer assessments. The questions and answers provide insight into consumer satisfaction with the health plan, satisfaction with the services received, and with general satisfaction with life. These results show an overwhelmingly positive view of the MCOs' services and the HCBS providers in KanCare. The MCOs were asked to provide HCBS consumer satisfaction data on a quarterly basis, starting with quarter three. Some MCOs relied upon the annual CAHPS surveys to prov ide this information to the health plan/KDHE, consequently they are still building their process to provide quarterly updates. Below is the information received for the HCBS satisfaction to date: Assessment Jul-21 Aug-21 Sept-21 Total % Total How satisfied are you with the Health Plan?

Quality Assurance/Monitoring Activity The State Quality Management Strategy (QMS) is designed to provide an overarching framework for the State to allocate resources in an efficient manner with the objective of driving meaningful quality improvemen t for KanCare members. The State's monitoring and oversight activities, across KDHE and KDADS, act as an early alert system to rapidly address MCO compliance issues and reported variances from expected results. Those monitoring and oversight activities rep resent the State's ongoing actions to ensure compliance with Federal and State contract standards and identify any need for system transformation. The framework of the QMS is currently being redesigned to support the KanCare program and the population it s erves in a holistic fashion to address all physical, behavioral, functional, and social determinants of health and independence needs of the enrolled population. A requirement for approval of the 1115 waiver was development of a State QMS to define waiver goals and corresponding statewide strategies, as well as all standards and technical specifications for contract performance measurement, analysis, and reporting. CMS finalized new expectations for managed care service delivery in the 2017 Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Final Rule. A Quality Strategy Toolkit was released in June 2021 and the State has worked to update the QMS to closely follow these recommendations. The intent of this QMS revision is to comply with the Final Rule, to establish regular review and revision of the State quality oversight process and maintain key State values of quality care to Medicaid recipients through continuous program improvement. The regular review and revision features a process to gain stakeholder input, tribal input, public notification, and publication to the Kansas Register. The current QMS defines technical specifications for data collection, maintenance, and reporting to demonstrate recipients are receiving medically necessary services and providers are paid timely for service delivery. The original strategy includes most pre -existing program measures for specific services and financial incentives called pay for performance (P4P) measures to withhold a percentage of the capitation payment the MCOs can earn b y satisfying certain quality benchmarks. Many of the program - specific, pre -existing measures were developed for the 1915(c) disability waivers designed and managed by the operating agency, KDADS, and administered by the single State Medicaid agency, KDHE. Regular and consistent cross -agency review of the QMS will highlight progress toward State goals and measures and related contractor progress. The outcome findings will demonstrate areas of compliance and non - compliance with Federal standards and State con tract requirements. This systematic review will advance trending year over year for the State to engage contractors in continuous monitoring and improvement activities that ultimately impact the quality of services and reinforce positive change. The State participated in the following activities: Ongoing automated report management, review, and feedback occurred between the State and the MCOs. Reports from the MCOs consist of a wide range of data reported on standardized templates. State administration of the reporting site transitioned to the External Quality Review audit team. The team continued to work with the site administrator to make improvements to the reporting database. For example, discontinuing unneeded reports, adding new reports, and updating the tip sheets with more robust informatio n for all levels of users. The State added Provider Satisfaction Survey results to the Report Administration system. This includes MCO submission of survey tools and methodology for State approval prior to survey implementation. These changes have been a pproved by the State and the MCOs, and the contract amendment has now been approved by CMS. The methodologies for the 2021 surveys were submitted on or before August 31, 2021. None of the plans met the new requirements in their 2021 surveys, and the Stat e sent feedback to each MCO with the changes that would be needed to meet the requirements in 2022. The MCOs are currently planning to do a collaborative survey in 2022, where providers answer the same questions regarding their experience with all three MCOs in the same survey. This plan includes the MCOs hiring a shared contractor to implement KanCare Third Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 09.30.2021 31 the survey. MCOs have been reminded that the methodology for the 2022 survey must be submitted to the State for approval at least 60 days prior to implementation. Monitored the External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) work plan. KFMC, the State's EQRO, and the State developed a tool to track EQRO, State, and MCO deliverables due dates. The tool is updated daily by KFMC and distributed to the State and MCOs qua rterly. Performance Improvement Project (PIP) meetings occurred in July (full EQRO meeting), August and September and included the EQRO, MCOs, KDADS, KDHE and a representative from the Department for Children and Family Services (DCF). MCOs began submitt ing PIP data directly into the web -based reporting system monthly. The new system allows for tracking and trending of reports and to monitor the effectiveness of MCO interventions. The following annual PIP reports were received, reviewed by KFMC, and appro ved this quarter: ABH Emergency Department and Food Insecurity, UHC Screening and Monitoring for People with Schizophrenia and Advance Directives, ABH Prenatal Care, and SHP Employment. Adjustments were made to PIP interventions that were considered ineffective, not capturing all the necessary data, or ones that required enhancement. Two new PIPs, MCO Collaborative COVID -19 Vaccination and UHC's Antidepressant Medication Management (AMM), received methodology approval and technical specifications for dat a submission were completed. Data for these PIPs should begin in November 2021. A member -friendly table of all the MCOs' PIPs, with a simplified description of their interventions, was added to the KanCare website. KDHE developed a table that includes more technical information and highlights the change being piloted with each intervention ( attached ). Both documents were updated to reflect UHC changing their Prenatal and Postpartum Care (PPC) PIP, the ending, and the COVID -19 Vaccine PIP replacement. These changes were finalized, and the new member -friendly version is posted. A meeting occurred with the EQRO, MCOs, KDADS, KDHE and DCF in July to discuss EQR O activities and concerns. KDHE continued monthly, informal meetings with KFMC to touch base on activities and to plan agendas for the Quarterly formal EQRO and monthly PIP meetings. Activities for the 2021 Annual Contract Review included a training for State staff involved in this year's review, approval of a three -year schedule for the reviews, and ABH's virtual onsite was held the last week in September. Medicaid Fraud Control Unit monthly meetings were held with the Attorney General's office to address fraud, waste, abuse cases, referrals to MCOs and State, and to collaborate on solutions to identify and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. Continued state staff participation in cross -agency long- term care meetings to report quality assurance and progra mmatic activities to KDHE for oversight and collaboration. Continued participation in weekly calls with each MCO to discuss ongoing provider and member issues and to troubleshoot operational problems. Progress is monitored through these calls and through i ssue logs. Leadership from KDADS, KDHE, and the three MCOs meet monthly to discuss issues and improvements to KanCare. Monitored large, global system issues through a weekly log issued to all MCOs and the State's fiscal agent. The resulting log is posted o n the KanCare website for providers and other interested parties. Continued monthly meetings to discuss trends and progress. Monitored member or provider specific issues through a tracking database that is shared with MCOs and KDADS for weekly review. Attended various provider training and workshops presented by the MCOs. Monitored for accuracy and to answer questions as needed. First and second quarter 2021 GeoAccess maps were uploaded to the KanCare website. KanCare Third Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 09.30.2021 32 The State completed a draft of updating the Q MS to comply with the Quality Strategy Toolkit that was released in June 2021. The State is transitioning toward a data driven QMS that follows the CFR as closely as possible. Completed gathering data to appropriately track LTSS metrics as well as all othe r strategies and objectives being proposed. Draft of the revised QMS was posted to the KanCare website, shared for feedback with the Medical Care Advisory Committee and sent for tribal consideration. State will allow at least 30 days for these groups to examine the proposed QMS and provide comments . Once this time period has elapsed (early November 2021), the State will review all reactions and adjust the QMS accordingly before submitting to CMS and posting the draft QMS to the KanCare website. The State asked the EQRO, KFMC, to complete an evalu ation of the effectiveness of the prior QMS. This review is now posted on the KanCare website. The State's response to KFMC's recommendations from this review have been incorporated into the draft, revised QMS. For the programs administered by KDADS: The Quality Assurance (QA) process is designed to give continuous feedback to KDADS, KDHE, and stakeholders regarding the quality of services being provided to KanCare members. KDADS quality assurance staff are integrated in the Long Term Services and Support s Commission and reported through the Financial and Information Services Commission at KDADS. This oversight is enhanced through collaboration with the Department of Children and Families and the Department of Health and Environment. A quality assurance protocol and interpretative guidelines are utilized to document this process and have been established with the goal of ensuring consistency in the reviews. QA staff review random samples of individual case files to monitor and report compliance with perform ance measures designated in each of the approved HCBS waivers. The MCOs contracted with Averifi to serve as a single vendor to conduct HCBS Provider Qualification audits. Below is the updated timeline that the KDADS Quality Review Team follows regarding the quality review process.

Managed Care Reporting Requirements a. A description of network adequacy reporting including GeoAccess mapping: Each MCO submits a quarterly network adequacy report. The State uses this report to monitor the quality of network data and changes to the networks, drill down into provider types and specialties, and extract data to respond to requests received f rom various stakeholders. The State's network data and analysis tools were moved from Excel into a dedicated database on a secure server during the second quarter of 2019. This database allows the State to give more robust and timely feedback to the MCOs. This method is less prone to breakdowns and improves business continuity. KanCare Third Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 09.30.2021 33 KDHE continued to give MCOs feedback on the accuracy and completeness of their quarterly report. As MCOs improve their reporting, feedback has become less about basic errors (duplica tes) and more detailed (at provider level). The Provider Network team implemented an updated feedback report and will continue to review revisions with the MCOs during the annual onsite reviews next quarter. The team began preparing for these presentations this quarter. Improvements included making the report flow better, adding information about Home Health provider findings, and including capacity error data. The State provided individualized feedback to MCOs to improve accuracy of mapped providers and HCBS provider reporting. The State team made improvements to the Access and Availability Report, the NEMT report, the feedback report, mapping formats, the Non -Participating Provider Reliance Report, and the HCBS Service Delivery Report. The team continues to match the MCOs' reports against additional data sources to give a clearer picture of the reports' accuracy and completeness. MCOs were sent feedback on the acute care hospitals reported in their first quarter PNtwk report and Geo map. MCOs reported back on discrepancies found between their reports and the State's list. These will also be discussed at the annual contract reviews during the next quarter. A s requested by KDHE leadership , and after seven rural hospitals closed between April 1, 2011 to March 12, 2020, a project began to review hospital coverage. Analysis will review travel distances for members in counties where hospital closures have occurred and for those counties where a hospital is not located in the county. M apping activities continued with the automated procedure using ArcGIS Pro to map providers based on the MCOs provider network report submissions. The State utilized the maps to compare the GeoAccess map that the MCO submits to find errors, omissions, or v erify gaps in coverage. This process ran smoothly with the network data submitted in quarter three. The State completed the development of an automated process to map HCBS providers and the number of members per waiver in each county. Most HCBS service pro viders travel to the member. Because there is a potential for privacy violations, these maps are not shared publicly, but are used for internal analysis of network adequacy. The maps were shared with KDADS via a secured web transfer process. Th e State developed a tool to analyze the MCO's online provider directory compliance with contract requirements. The tool will give the MCO a percentage of compliance score and feedback on which metrics need the most improvement. The State also began work to stand ardize the MCO's submission of their online directory via a format that can be uploaded by KDHE. The State met with the MCOs to develop a process and a template. This work should be completed and implemented by next quarter. M ost exception request wor k this quarter centered on UHC's Lab and X -ray provider maps. UHC has shown a significantly smaller network of providers in the maps. UHC needed assistance to calibrate the data to pull all Lab and X -ray providers that are available to members. See map image s below. This MCO will now be required to report quarterly on progress to fill this coverage gap in the Access and Availability report. E xamples of maps mentioned in this report are below.

Additional requirements have been impleme nted to confirm review and resolutions regarding instances of seclusion, restraint, restrictive intervention, and deathfollowed appropriate policies and procedures. KDADS implemented enhancements to the AIR system on 9/17/18. These enhancements allow KDAD S, KDHE, and MCOs to manage specific critical incidents in accordance with KDADS' AIR Policy. All t he MCOs have access to the system. MCOs and KDADS staff may now both read and write information directly into the AIR system. Creating an Adverse Incident Report is forward facing, so anyone from a concerned citizen to an MCO Care Coordinator can report into the AIR systemby visiting the KDADS website 4 and selecting Adverse Incident Reporting (AIR) under the quick links. All reports are input into the system electronically. KDADS requires duplicate reporting forinstances of Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation to both DCF and the AIR system. Determinationsreceived from DCF are received by KDADS staff who review the AIR system and attach to an existing report, or manually enter reports that are not already in the AIR system. After reports are received and reviewed and waiver information is verified by KDADS staff in MMIS, MCOs receivenotification of assigned reports. MCOs have the ability to provide follow -up information within the AIR system and address corrective action plans issued by KDADS as appropriate. To protectmember protected health information, M CO access is limited to only their enrolled members. 4 www.kdads.ks.gov KanCare Third Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 09.30.2021 40 KDADS Program Integrity continues providing AIR training to Community Service Providers and any interested parties statewide upon request. Access to training materials and contact information to reques t a training is located on the KDADS website. Along with provider and individual training, KDADS provides updated trainings to the MCOs as requested for new staff and as a refresher to ensure efficient and consistent processes. AIR is not intended to repl ace the State reporting system for abuse, neglect, and exploitation (ANE) of individuals who are served on the behavioral health and HCBS programs. ANE substantiations are reported separately to KDADS from the Department of Children and Families (DCF) and monitored by the KDADS program integrity team. The program integrity team ensures individuals with reported ANE are receiving adequate supports and protections available through KDADS programs, KanCare, and other community resources.

KanCare Ombudsman Purpose The KanCare Ombudsman Office helps Kansas Medicaid members and applicants, with a priority on individuals participating in long-term supports and services through KanCare. The KanCare Ombudsman Office assists KanCare members and applicants with access, service, and benefit problems. The KanCare Ombudsman office helps with: Answers to questions Resolving issues Understanding letters from KanCare Respo nding when you disagree with a decision or change Completing an application or renewal Filing a complaint (grievance) Filing an appeal or fair hearing Learning about in -home services, also called Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Special Terms and Conditions (2019 -2023), Section 36 for KanCare, provides the KanCare Ombudsman program description and objectives. IV. Accessibility to the Ombudsman's Office A. Initial Contacts The KanCare Ombudsman Office was available to members and applicants of KanCare (Medicaid) by phone, email, writt en communication, social media and the Integrated R eferral and Intake S ystem (IRIS) during third quarter of 202 1. The KanCare Ombudsman Office has helped KanCare members and applicants since the inception of KanCare in January 2013. Starting in November 2 015, the KanCare Ombudsman office began a volunteer program to assist with answering calls and helping with applications. There are two satellite offices: Wichita and Kansas City Metro . The last several quarters of contacts are down ; we believe it is due to the COVID -19 pandemic.

According to this information it appears that the Clearinghouse contacts have a similar decrease to first quarter last year (2020) as the KanCare Ombudsman office. Q4 2019 Q1 2020 Q2 2020 % - Ombudsman Volunteer Program The KanCare Ombudsman Office has two satellite office s for the volunteer program: one in Kansas City Metro and on e in Wichita. The volunteers in both satellite offices answer KanCare questions, help with issues and assist with filling out KanCare applications (by phone only during the COVID -19 pandemic ). During third quarter, the re have been volunteers assisting in the offices : two in each office and two volunteer s in training (one in each office ). The new volunteers will continue their training into fourth quarter. Both satellite offices follow COVID -19 protocol for people in the buildings and the number of people in the buildings have been very limited. Calls are covered by volunteers in the satellite offices, and when there is a gap in coverage, the Topeka staff cover the phones. Office Volunteer Hours # of Volunteers # of hours covered/wk .

Outreach by KanCare Ombudsman Office The KanCare Ombudsman Office is responsible for helping members , applicants and providers understand the KanCare application process, benefits, and services, and provide training and outreach to community organizations. The office does this through : resources provided on the KanCare Ombudsman web pages resources provided with contacts to memb ers, applicants, and providers outreach through presentations, conferences, conference calls, video calls, social media, and in -person contacts . The large increase in contacts for third quarter continues to be directly related to our AmeriCorps VISTA volun teers. They are in the process of updating our KanCare Application Assistance Guide that lists organizations that help with filling out KanCare applications. They are checking current organizations on the list and contacting all Local Public Health Departments and other community organizations that have the potential to provide that type of assistance. They are explaining what our organization does , what resources we have available and asking if they would like a packet of our brochures to share with staff and consumers. We are very excited about this outreach and hope that it will create new opportunities for collaboration across the state. The below chart shows the outreach efforts by the KanCare Ombudsman Off ice.

This is being done to better serve those whose primary language is Spanish. It provides four options for people calling the toll-free number and being routed to the Kansas City Metro Satellite office: Spanish - routes to a line that tells how to leave a message in Spanish Providers - transfers provider calls to KDHE Health Care Finance front desk to be routed to a Provider Manager for assistance. Clearinghouse - if callers are trying to reach the KanCare Clearinghouse, they can choose this option and will be routed directly to the number. The caller can stay on the line or press zero to get the KanCare Ombudsman office. The next step is setting up the same call handler options for the Wichita office. B. Assistance for People without Insurance The document, Assistance for Peopl e without Insurance was updated in third quarter to include lists of clinics that provide dental, vision and pharmacy assistance . The KanCare Ombudsman office a lso received feedback that this document is frequently used by state office agency front desk s to assist people who call in and do not have health insurance and are not eligible for Medicaid . To view a copy of the updated document , go to the KanCare Ombudsman website . C. Future: KanCare O mbudsman Survey and Listening Sessions The KanCare Ombudsman office has a survey and a series of listening session s scheduled for October/November .
