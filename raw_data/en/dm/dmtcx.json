It also brings out the difference in performance of various constituent states. Design/methodology/approach This study relied on both primary and secondary data for the analyses. For the primary data, the study gathered experts' opinions to validate the authors' inferences. For the secondary data, it relies on government data provided in websites. Findings Based on the quartile analysis and cluster analysis of the secondary data, the authors find that the constituent states responded differently during the first and second waves. This was due to the differences in SC characteristics attributed to varied demographics and administrative efficiency. Research limitations/implications This paper's analyses is primarily limited to secondary information and inferences are based on them. The study has important implications for implementing the large-scale vaccination drives by government and constituent states for better coordination and last-mile delivery. Originality/value The contribution is unique in studying the performance of constituent states using statistical techniques, with secondary data from authentic sources. It is also unique in combining this observation with validation from experts.
