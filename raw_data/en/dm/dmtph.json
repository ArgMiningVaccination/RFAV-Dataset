The resulting synthesis communicates how climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution can be tackled jointly within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals. Making Peace With Nature: A scientific blueprint to tackle the climate, biodiversity and pollution emergencies serves to translate the current state of scientific knowledge into crisp, clear and digestible facts-based messages that the world can relate to and follow up on. It first provides an Earth diagnosis of current and projected human-induced environmental change, by putting facts and interlinkages in perspective, including by using smart infographics. In building on this diagnosis, the report identifies the shifts needed to close gaps between current actions and those needed to achieve sustainable development. The analysis is anchored in current economic, social and ecological reality and framed by economics and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. By synthesizing the latest scientific findings from the global environmental assessments, the report communicates the current status of the world's urgent issues and opportunities to solve them. Ahead of the fifth [United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-5)](https://environmentassembly.unenvironment.org/unea5), UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Inger Andersen launched the report [during an online press briefing](https://www.unep.org/events/unep-event/launch-unep-making-peace-nature-report). Making Peace with Nature is the defining task of the 21st century. UNEP's new report offers a blueprint for the sustainable world we need, with practical recommendations on how to tackle the three planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution \"Humanity is waging war on nature\", [warned UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres in 2020](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/speeches/2020-12-02/address-columbia-university-the-state-of-the-planet), referring to how our consumption and production systems are destroying the environment. The world can transform its relationship with nature and tackle the climate, biodiversity and pollution crises together to secure a sustainable future and prevent future pandemics, according to a new report by the UN "}
