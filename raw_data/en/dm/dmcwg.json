Whether you want to participate in this program or not, we are here to help you with herbal medicines and naturopathic choices. We are making herbal formulas to support you and to help you through the vaccination process.

We are pro choice for everyone and believe that its our responsibility as health care practitioners to offer support no matter what you do! So talk with us and let's get your health optimal. If you decide to get vaccinated then please connect with us and we will make you a supporting herbal formula to take during the week of each vaccination. we can even help you with herbs before you get vaccinated to support your immunity and boost your body. We use a combination of immunity boosting herbs, anti inflammation herbs and blood balancing herbals to help you stay strong and to help reduce the opportunity for your body responding negatively to the vaccine.
