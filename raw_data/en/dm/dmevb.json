(As of 4/24/2023) After three years of caring for patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Penn State Health has made masking optional in most areas. Wearing a level-1 (surgical grade) mask is still necessary in non-private areas in the Emergency Department as well as in the Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and Adult Hematology-Oncology Unit. Additionally, anyone experiencing runny nose, sore throat or cough is asked to wear a mask while in any Penn State Health hospital or outpatient location. Visitation Guidelines Penn State Health has revised its patient visitation guidelines. (As of 4/18/2022) These visitation guidelines apply to all Penn State Health care settings with the exception of COVID-19 units. Contact your patient's care team before visiting if you have questions about how the policy applies to you. Penn State Health staff will continue to monitor COVID-19 and adjust its visitation policy appropriately. Changes include: - With some exceptions, the health system will permit all visitors for all adult and pediatric inpatient and outpatient patients from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Units may restrict the number of people at the patient's bedside to ensure safety and privacy. - No more than two people at a time may visit critical care patients. The hospital unit will coordinate visits for people under age 18. - Only two family or support persons over age 18 are permitted to visit Labor and Delivery patients. The restriction doesn't apply to postpartum patients. - No more than two visitors are permitted in adult and pediatric outpatient surgery and procedure departments, emergency departments and outpatient clinics at any given time.
