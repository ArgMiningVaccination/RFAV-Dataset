Vertigo can interfere with your everyday activities and make you long for relief, whether neurological conditions or inner ear abnormalities bring it on. A variety of natural therapies can help you restore your balance in the comfort of your home, even if serious instances often require medical attention. We'll look at seven potent all-natural treatments in this article that may bring harmony back to your life, help you get over your vertigo and enable you to embrace steadiness once again. Different types of vertigo Different varieties of vertigo can appear, each with its own traits and underlying reasons. Knowing the various forms of vertigo can aid in determining the precise problem and recommending the best course of action. There are two primary forms of vertigo: Peripheral Vertigo This particular form of vertigo results from dysfunction with the inner ear, more specifically the vestibular system [ [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3096243/)]. The majority of vertigo instances are peripheral vertigo, which is frequently related to problems like: - Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) The displacement of calcium crystals in the inner ear results in this type of peripheral vertigo, which is the most prevalent type. Specific head motions can cause [quick, short bouts of vertigo](https://longevity.technology/lifestyle/vertigo-causes-symptoms-diagnosis-prevention/) to occur. - Meniere's disease Recurrent episodes of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus and a sense of fullness or pressure in the ear are all symptoms of Meniere's disease, an inner ear disorder that affects the chronic stage [ [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK536955/)]. Although the exact etiology of Meniere's disease is unknown, fluid accumulation in the inner ear is likely to be a contributing factor. - Vestibular neuritis Typically brought on by a viral infection, vestibular neuritis, causes the vestibular nerve to become inflamed and causes severe vertigo that can continue for days or weeks. It frequently comes with dizziness, unbalance and attention problems. - Labyrinthitis An infection or inflammation of the inner ear known as labyrinthitis is typically brought on by a viral or bacterial infection. It results in vertigo, hearing loss and may also be accompanied by ear discomfort and ringing (tinnitus). Central vertigo A malfunction or disruption of the central nervous system, particularly the brainstem or cerebellum, is associated with central vertigo [ [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441861/)]. Peripheral vertigo is more uncommon, but it can also be more severe and persistent. Conditions like the following can lead to central vertigo: - Migraine-associated vertigo Some people who suffer from migraines also feel vertigo. Recurrent episodes of vertigo accompanied by migraines or symptoms that [indicate a migraine](https://longevity.technology/lifestyle/new-study-shows-your-eating-habits-might-lead-to-migraines/) are the hallmarks of this form of vertigo, also known as vestibular migraine. - Brainstem strokes Vertigo can result from strokes that affect the brain stem because they interrupt blood flow and harm the vestibular circuits in the brain. - Multiple Sclerosis In addition to other [neurological symptoms](https://longevity.technology/lifestyle/7-neurological-disorder-signs-in-adults-you-should-not-ignore/), this inflammatory illness can harm the nerves in the central nervous system, resulting in vertigo. Importance of natural remedies for vertigo When it comes to treating vertigo, natural therapies provide a tempting alternative to traditional drugs and treatments. Natural remedies provide a comprehensive strategy that focuses on resolving the underlying causes of vertigo rather than only suppressing the symptoms, even though medical interventions can be essential and successful in some circumstances. The tenderness with which natural treatments affect the body is one of their main benefits. Natural remedies often harness the power of nature's therapeutic capabilities without producing more harm or imbalances, in contrast to pharmaceutical medications, which occasionally may have side effects and significant hazards. 10 Natural remedies to resolve vertigo at home Vertigo may be something that's hard to manage, but there are a few natural remedies you can try at home to lessen the symptoms and [find relief](https://longevity.technology/lifestyle/5-quick-ways-to-find-relief-from-vertigo/). Here are 7 all-natural home remedies for vertigo: 1. Epley Maneuver For the treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a particular head movement method known as the Epley maneuver is performed. Small calcium crystals in the inner ear can break loose and cause BPPV, which causes vertigo attacks by interfering with the brain's regular balancing signals [ [4](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/17930-canalith-repositioning-procedure-crp)]. To do Epley maneuver: - Start in an upright position: Stretch your legs out in front of you while you sit on a bed or other hard surfaces. - Turn your head: Make a 45-degree turn with your head toward the direction that causes vertigo. For instance, if moving your head to the right normally causes you to experience vertigo, start by doing so. - Lie down quickly: Turn your head to the side as you recline on your back. Your head should be at a 45-degree angle or just slightly off the edge of the bed. - Wait for symptoms to subside: Remain in this position for about 30 seconds or until your vertigo symptoms subside. - Turn your head in the opposite direction: Keep your head at a 45-degree angle and gently turn it to the opposite side (from where it was first positioned) without raising it. - Roll onto your side: Keeping your head turned to the side, roll onto your side facing downwards in the direction your head is facing. You should be lying on your side with your nose pointed towards the floor. - Slowly sit up: Finally, slowly sit up while maintaining the head position. Be cautious and take your time. 2. Eat or drink ginger An effective natural treatment for vertigo symptoms is ginger, a potent herb. It is well-known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-nausea qualities and has been used for millennia for therapeutic purposes. Here is how ginger might alleviate vertigo: - Anti-inflammatory properties Inflammation of the vestibular system or inner ear can result in vertigo. There are substances in ginger known as gingerols and paradols that are highly effective anti-inflammatory agents. Ginger consumption helps lessen inflammation and ease vertigo symptoms brought on by inflammation [ [5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3537898/)]. - Nausea relief For centuries, ginger has been used to treat nausea and vomiting. Many people who have vertigo also have nausea and dizziness. Ginger helps ease nausea and soothe the stomach, easing pain brought on by vertigo. - Improves blood circulation Every part of the body, including the inner ear, benefits from ginger's improved blood circulation. For balance and equilibrium to be maintained, there must be enough blood flow to the inner ear. Ginger may enhance inner ear function and lessen vertigo symptoms by increasing blood circulation. 3. Stay hydrated Drinking plenty of water is important for general health and can help with controlling vertigo symptoms. Dehydration can aggravate vertigo and cause a number of other medical problems. Here are some reasons why maintaining hydration is crucial and how it helps relieve vertigo: - Maintains fluid balance The fluid balance of the body, including the fluid levels in the inner ear, is maintained by drinking enough water. Balance and spatial direction are crucially maintained by the inner ear [ [6](https://www.westsidehn.com/dizziness-lightheadedness-vertigo/vertigo-and-dehydration/)]. The sensitive inner ear systems might be impacted by dehydration, which could result in vertigo symptoms. - Supports circulation Maintaining appropriate blood flow throughout the body, particularly to the inner ear, requires hydration. The inner ear obtains the nutrition and oxygen it needs to operate correctly when blood circulation is at its best. You can promote healthy blood flow and enhance inner ear function by maintaining hydration. - Reduces dizziness The symptoms of vertigo can be made worse by dehydration, which can make you feel lightheaded and dizzy. You can lessen your chance of developing further vertigo and ease its severity by maintaining appropriate hydration. 4. Sunlight exposure or vitamin D A vital ingredient called vitamin D is important for sustaining general health, which includes the balance and health of the inner ear. We refer to it as the [\"sunshine vitamin\"](https://longevity.technology/lifestyle/vitamin-d-sources-benefits-and-dosage/) since sunlight can trigger our bodies to manufacture it. Calcium, a mineral required for strong bones, may be absorbed more easily with the help of vitamin D. Maintaining stability and lowering the risk of falls, which can start or exacerbate vertigo episodes, require strong and healthy bones. 5. Avoid triggers A key component of controlling vertigo and lowering the frequency and severity of vertigo episodes is [avoiding triggers](https://longevity.technology/lifestyle/10-foods-to-avoid-if-you-suffer-from-vertigo/). Finding your triggers and reducing your exposure to them might help you avoid or treat vertigo symptoms. The following are some typical triggers to be aware of and ways to prevent them: - Head movements For those who suffer from certain forms of vertigo, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), sudden or quick head movements can cause dizziness. Try to move your head gently and deliberately to reduce the possibility of inducing vertigo. - Visual stimuli For certain people, excessive visual stimulation or moving objects might cause vertigo symptoms. Try to stay away from situations that have a lot of visual stimulation, including crowded spaces with flashing lights or a lot of movement. Stop doing anything that needs extended visual attention, including reading or viewing screens and take pauses. - Motion and travel For those who are vulnerable, motion sickness can result in vertigo. Avoid or limit your exposure to motion-intensive activities, such as rides at theme parks or boat tours, if you are prone to motion sickness. To lessen vertigo brought on by motion, think about driving in the front seat or facing the road. 6. Deep breathing and relaxation techniques By encouraging relaxation, [lowering stress levels](https://longevity.technology/lifestyle/strategies-for-a-restful-life-stress-reduction-and-finding-balance/) and regaining a sense of peace, deep breathing and relaxation exercises are effective aids for controlling vertigo symptoms. These methods can lessen anxiety, which exacerbates episodes of vertigo. Find a place that is peaceful and cozy. Lay down or take a seat comfortably. Lie on your stomach with one hand and your chest with the other. By inhaling slowly and deeply through your nose, you may cause your belly to rise as your lungs fill with air. Feel your tummy slouch as you gently exhale through your lips. For many minutes, keep doing this deep breathing exercise while concentrating on the feeling of your breath. 7. Acupressure In order to encourage relaxation, reduce pain, and regain equilibrium, acupressure involves applying pressure to certain places on the body. Acupressure can help relieve vertigo symptoms and improve general well-being by stimulating these areas [ [7](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320492)]. Here are some acupressure areas to concentrate on to relieve vertigo: - Pericardium 6 (P6) Positioned between the two tendons on the inside forearm, about three finger widths below the wrist crease. This spot can be gently pressed or massaged in circular patterns to aid with vertigo-related nausea and dizziness. - Gallbladder 20 (GB20) Situated between the two enormous vertical muscles at the base of the skull, in the hollows on the sides of the neck. These spots can be massaged in a circular motion or with strong pressure to aid with vertigo-related headaches, neck tightness and dizziness. - Stomach 36 (ST36) Located on the lower leg, a little to the outside of the shinbone, about four finger widths below the kneecap. This spot can be gently pressed or massaged to improve equilibrium and reduce vertigo-related symptoms. 8. Balance exercises The vestibular system may be strengthened, stability can be increased, and vertigo episodes can be less frequent and more severe by performing balancing exercises. Through balance exercises, you may improve your coordination, proprioception (knowledge of your body's position) and the strength of the muscles that help you stay balanced. As your balance improves, remember to start carefully and increase the intensity and length of the exercises gradually. Safety comes first. Therefore it's critical to pay attention to your body and avoid pushing yourself over your limitations. 9. Lifestyle modifications Changing your way of living can help you manage vertigo and lessen how much of an influence it has on your everyday life. These changes are meant to reduce triggers, boost general well-being and encourage balance. Change your surroundings as needed to lessen the chance of falls and injury during vertigo attacks. Remove trip hazards, make sure there is enough lighting, use non-slip mats in the restroom and, if necessary, think about adding grab bars or handrails. 10. Stress management Use [meditation or mindfulness techniques](https://longevity.technology/lifestyle/the-art-of-rest-how-to-recharge-your-mind-and-body-for-optimal-health/) to build present-moment awareness and lessen stress. Find a calm area, get into a comfortable chair and concentrate on your breathing, physical sensations, or a particular item. Accept thoughts as they are and don't judge them. Regular mindfulness or meditation practice can help boost overall well-being and increase stress resilience. Conclusion People may take control of their vertigo management and general well-being by putting these natural remedies and lifestyle changes into practice. Keep in mind that every individual with vertigo may have a different experience, so it's vital to identify what works for you and get expert help when necessary. FAQs How long can vertigo last? Vertigo bouts can last anywhere from a few seconds or minutes to hours or even days in some circumstances. How do you sleep with vertigo?
