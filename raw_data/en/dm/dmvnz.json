It addresses physical, emotional, mental, social, and environmental influences on health and makes use of all appropriate therapies and disciplines to achieve optimal health. Defining principles of integrative medicine: - The patient and clinician are partners in the healing process. - All factors that influence health, wellness, and disease are taken into consideration. - Appropriate use of both conventional and alternative methods facilitates the body's innate healing response. - Effective interventions that are natural and/or less invasive should be used when possible. Integrative medicine neither rejects conventional medicine nor accepts alternative therapies uncritically. - Good medicine is based on good science. It is inquiry-driven and open to new paradigms. - Alongside the concept of treatment, the broader concepts of health promotion and the prevention of illness are paramount.

Acupuncture Acupuncture is an important component of traditional Chinese Medicine that continues to be a topic of modern clinical research and practice. It involves the insertion of extremely thin, sterile needles at specific points along the body. In the U.S., acupuncture has most commonly been used in the treatment of various kinds of musculoskeletal pain. Both the National Institute of Health and the World Health Organization recommends the use of acupuncture for many conditions. At Student Health, acupuncture services are available to help you manage stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, pain, digestive disorders, headaches, gynecological concerns, and many other health issues. Our acupuncture services are integrated into our primary care department so that each patient receives the best of both allopathic/Western Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Mindfulness and Meditation We all know how to take our bodies on a vacation, but do we know how to give our minds a break? In mindfulness workshops, we will practice how to unwind and let our minds settle into a relaxed but focused state. Each session will focus on simple and easy techniques to calm the mind and relax the body. The pressures of school and work can seem overwhelming, but learning how to relax in a mindful way can help us let go of the stress and work more effectively in our daily lives. We offer a variety of ways for students and postdoctoral scholars to learn and practice mindfulness. These include: - Mindfulness workshops or other wellness presentations by request, such as for classes or student groups. Email our [Wellness and Outreach Program Manager](mailto:caije@ohsu.edu)to discuss options or schedule. - Individual mindfulness coaching sessions with Student Health's Wellness and Outreach Program Manager.
