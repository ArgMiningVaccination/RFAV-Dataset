Dr. Minhaj Sirajuddin is an Associate Investigator at the Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine (DBT-inStem). | | Protein UFMylation, the covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-like modifier UFM1 to susbtrates, is emerging as a posttranslational endoplasmic and when ribosomes stall during protein translocation and serves as a signal to degrade stalled nascent chains. However, we have a poor understanding of how UFM1 is attached to RPL26. I will present our latest findings where we use a rebuilding approach to define the molecular players and principles of protein UFMylation. I will present our work which reveals regulatory principles driving the attachment and removal of UFM1 from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-bound ribosomes to regulate protein homeostasis at the ER. | | Abstract: While deep neural networks have achieved large gains in performance on benchmark datasets, their performance often degrades drastically with changes in data distribution encountered during real-world deployment. In this work, through systematic experiments and theoretical analysis, we attempt to understand the key reasons behind such brittleness of neural networks in real-world settings and why fixing these issues is exciting but challenging. We first hypothesize, and through empirical+theoretical studies demonstrate, that (i) neural network training exhibits \"simplicity bias\" (SB), where the models learn only the simplest discriminative features and (ii) SB is one of the key reasons behind the non-robustness of neural networks. A natural way to fix SB in trained models is by identifying the discriminative features used by the model and learning new features \"orthogonal\" to the learned feature. Post-hoc gradient-based attribution methods are regularly used to identify the key discriminative features of a model. But, due to a lack of ground truth, a thorough evaluation of even the most basic input gradient attribution method is still missing in the literature. Our second contribution is to overcome this challenge through experiments and theory on real and designed datasets. Our results demonstrate that (i) input gradient attribution does NOT highlight correct features on standard models (i.e., trained on original data) but surprisingly, it does highlight correct features on adversarially trained models (i.e., trained using adversarial training) and (ii) \"feature leakage\", which refers to the phenomenon wherein, given an instance, its input gradients highlight the location of discriminative features in the given instance as well as in other instances that are present in the dataset, is the reason behind why input gradient attribution fails for standard models. Our work raises more questions than it answers, so we will end with interesting directions for future work. Based on joint works with Harshay research scientist at Google Research India, Bengaluru.

A cellular process is recreated from its building blocks in an optimized and controlled environment to pinpoint the exact molecular interactions and basic mechanisms. Microtubule based transport is one such cellular process that is responsible for the polarity establishment in fission yeast cells. A number of cellular functions including cell division is controlled by polarity establishment in the fission yeast cells. Stabilized, multi-protein assemblies called polarity markers are transported by the plus end directed motors to mark the cellular ends for a polar growth. What stabilizes these multi-protein assemblies at the microtubule ends and how the microtubule based protein transport can generate the pattern of a kinase protein (specific to fission yeasts) is what I am going to talk about. | | Natural protein sequences exist in a space that must be locally dense (with many degenerate solutions in the neighborhood of any particular solution) and connected (so that evolution can 'walk' in the space). But protein function, especially for oligomeric protein machine complexes, depends on finely tuned cooperative interactions (epistasis) between the constituent parts. Epistasis can break the connectivity in sequence space, since intermediates along an evolutionary path cannot be guaranteed to be functional. My goal is to study and understand constraints on the sequence space that has allowed evolution to come up with the vast diversity proteins seen in nature. In the seminar, I will discuss a study of the DNA polymerase clamp loader complex, an essential protein machine required for chromosomal replication, in the context of the above mentioned goal. We carried out a deep mutational scan to map the mutational sensitivity and reveal allosteric communication in the protein assembly. I will also discuss ongoing work on using the bacteriophage assay platform to study the evolvability of clamp loader sequences. | | Animals employ acoustic signals in a number of communicative behavioral contexts, consisting of notes organised into distinct vocal sequences. This temporal pattern or syntactic structure may also encode information about individual or group identity. Here, I will discuss the evolution and function of vocal sequences in diverse animals, using a combination of field and laboratory recordings. I will discuss recent findings on the communicative function of vocal sequences in anurans and birds. In short, we find that two anuran species modify the content of their vocal sequences in order to communicate behavioral context. On the other hand, budgerigars in the laboratory do not modify their vocal sequences according to context, but instead appear to use these sequences as a higher-order signature of group identity. Finally, I will discuss how vocal sequences in birds diversify across geographical barriers, specifically Asian mountain ranges. The evolution of bird song exhibits interesting parallels with the diversification of human language, and I will discuss how the tools we employ may be used to obtain broader insight. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| The evolution of morphological traits is often strongly influenced by functional and biomechanical demands. Perhaps the best example of this is the avian bill, a multifunctional appendage consisting of an inner bony core and an outer keratinous rhamphotheca, which presents a unique opportunity to study form-function relationships. Among the varied functions of the bill, certain groups of birds use their bills to excavate tree hollows for nesting, roosting and feeding. The physical stresses experienced during this mechanically demanding task may be linked to bill shape and material properties, and also to broader factors like environmental conditions which influence the availability and mechanical properties of the substrate. Here, we examine these relationships in the frugivorous Asian and African barbets, which occupy diverse climatic regimes and excavate nest hollows in trees. Using micro-CT scans of museum specimens coupled with landmark-based geometric morphometrics, we find that bill shape diversity has accumulated gradually over time in both clades under allometric constraints, and exhibits a significant relationship with climatic variables. Secondly, using finite element analysis and beam theoretic approaches, we find that maxillary geometry trades off with excavation performance under different loading regimes. Our study thus aims for an integrative, interdisciplinary understanding of the evolution of morphological traits in birds. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Several examples within mammalian organ-systems indicate that a \"differentiated mature-cell status\" may not be permanent, and that continual maintenance through cell-type-specific gene-regulation may be required to maintain a specific cellular state. Cells of the brain- neurons and glia- are no exception, and depend on dynamic gene regulation for maintaining normal functioning. These regulations must include induced and adaptive responses aimed at restoring homeostasis under conditions of physiological perturbations, such as injury, stress and disease. However, once formed during development, how the adult neuronal and glial cells maintain their form and function through a lifespan, and how they may adapt to perturbations, remain poorly understood. Research in my laboratory focuses on understanding genetic programs that allow mature brain cells to respond to homeostatic needs as well as situations of physiological perturbation. Taking an in vivo cell-specific approach, studies from my laboratory in the past few years have made significant revelations about fate-restriction of adult neural stem cells and maintenance of neuron and microglia in the adult brain. Collectively, our studies indicate that proactive suppression of alternative potentials may serve as a strategy for maintaining homeostatic cellular functions, while keeping the possibility of divergent adaptive functions open. In this seminar I will discuss our recent findings and ongoing studies, that collectively shed light on cell-specific genetic programs enabling homeostatic maintenance of the mammalian adult brain. | | The advent of mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 has laid the foundation stone for mRNA based therapeutic platform. In this platform, mRNA encoding the therapeutic protein, is complexed with lipids to form lipid nanoparticles, and is injected parenterally into the patient\u00e2s body. The internalized mRNA expresses the therapeutic protein in the hepatic, muscle, or blood cells of the patient and mediates symptomatic treatment. This mRNA therapy bypasses the protein expression and purification steps required for the current recombinant protein based biotherapeutics, thereby, reducing the cost of treatment substantially. The modular nature of mRNA therapeutics allows rapid as well as parallel product development for the treatment of many diseases. The focus of the talk will be the development of mRNA based biotherapeutic technology platform for combating the huge burden of genetic disorders and cancer, in India. The speaker shall also talk about his research experience in the indigenous development of a potential mRNA vaccine candidate, which has elicited strong immune response in mice and protected hamsters from live SARS-CoV-2 challenge. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Regulation of neuronal gene expression through activity-driven transcription of immediate-early genes has been well documented1. Neuronal Ca2+ signals, with slower altered dynamics, occur upon stimulation of metabotropic receptors followed by IP3-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release and store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). An understanding of how such IP3/Ca2+ signals regulate gene expression is lacking in part because a Ca2+ responsive NFAT ortholog is absent in Drosophila. A series of transcriptomic screens in Drosophila neurons2,3 helped identify gene families whose expression is regulated by the IP3R and key components of SOCE. IP3/Ca2+ signals and SOCE-driven neuronal gene expression functions in different contexts ranging from the larval to pupal transition2, flight circuit maturation3, and others4. I have investigated putative transcriptional mechanisms by which IP3/Ca2+ signaling and SOCE regulate the expression of genes in pupal and adult neurons. In a recent study, we have shown that Set2, the Histone 3 lysine 36 methyltransferase forms part of a transcriptional feedback loop in a larval glutamatergic neuron subset to regulate the larval to pupal transition upon nutrient stress5. Another context in which we investigate the role of Set2 downstream of SOCE is in a subset of pupal and adult dopaminergic neurons required for maturation and function of the Drosophila flight circuit. To bridge the gap between Ca2+ signals and the expression of specific genes, including Set2, I have analyzed the upstream regions of genes targeted by SOCE and identified potential binding sites for the homeotic transcription factor GAF. This work identifies a critical developmental window wherein a novel signaling axis mediated by GAF and Set2 acts downstream of SOCE in a set of dopaminergic neurons. This pathway targets the expression of specific voltage-gated ion-channel genes to regulate neuronal excitability and affect flight bout durations. In summary, these findings identify a Ca2+ responsive transcription factor in Drosophila neurons that amplifies changes in gene expression profiles through an activating histone modifier.

POC diagnostics empowered the primary care providers and enabled them with better clinical decisions. POC diagnosis by common Lateral flow (LF) assays typically utilizes the visually read reporters, such as gold particles, which read qualitative (i.e. yes/no) result cartridges with low sensitivity. To improve sensitivity and develop quantitative LF assays, we replaced the visual reporters with fluorescent reporters to detect different biomarkers by using an instrument. Fluorescent reporters-based lateral flow assays have obtained great value since they significantly improve the sensitivity of the biomarker with the quantitative analysis, and still maintain the advantages of being affordable, rapid, simple, and portable when compared with the common lateral flow assay. Multiple fluorescent reporters such as fluorescent dyes, and lanthanide labels have promoted the development of Fluorescent lateral flow assay. In this presentation, I will discuss the development and evaluation of different fluorescent reporters used in the LF and their specific properties as well as signal enhancement techniques using the carbohydrate-binding module, Fragmented antibodies, cellulose-based test membrane, cellulose nanofiber, Graphene oxide and Multiwall carbon nanotubes helping to enhance detection performance. Along with that we have used these sensitive and accurate fluorescent labels for the development of fluorescent lateral flow assay to detect biomarkers for a cardiovascular disorders, chronic kidney diseases, mild-Trauma Brain Injury, and cancer. This presentation will also cover the multiplex assay development and the cell-free protein production system using the leishmaniasis lysate. | | Microbial recognition by the pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system results in transcriptional induction of pro-inflammatory gene program that is critical for host protection. The PRR induced inflammatory cytokines play an important role in mobilization of innate immune responses as well as activation of adaptive immunity However, many of the same innate inflammatory cytokines are also drivers of pathology in T cell mediated auto-immune diseases and during T cell targeted cancer immunotherapies. Although blocking individual cytokines can mitigate some pathology, the upstream mechanisms governing overabundant innate inflammatory cytokine production in T cell drive pathology have been less clear. Recent work from my laboratory has led to the discovery that cognate interactions between effector memory CD4 T cells and myeloid cells leads to induction of an inflammatory transcriptional profile in the innate immune system that is reminiscent of, yet entirely independent of, classical pattern recognition receptor activation. We have identified critical signaling nodes that are engaged by effector memory CD4 T cells to mobilize a broad proinflammatory program in myeloid cells. Cytokine storms and toxicity as well as autoimmune pathology can be completely rescued by interfering with these signaling nodes in multiple models of T cell driven inflammation suggesting that T cell instruction of the innate immune system is a primary driver of sterile inflammation and immunopathology. While these pathways might have evolved as a mechanism of host protection during reinfection by virulent pathogens, they contribute to destructive inflammation and pathology during T cell driven diseases. Specific signaling nodes and implications for therapeutic interventions will be discussed. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Precise neuronal function is the key to a proper functional brain. But as simple as it seems, it is regulated by a variety of signals impinging on various parts of a single neuron. These signals represent particular stimuli and modulate neuronal function. Hence, neuronal output is the function of multiple inputs computed together through various logics for eliciting an appropriate response. Calcium (Ca2+) signalling is one of the ways with which external inputs operate inside the neuron. These signals operate through various Ca2+ puffs or waves of different amplitudes and frequencies to convey required messages. Ca2+ hence emerges as a universal signalling molecule to regulate various cellular functions like fertilisation, proliferation, gene transcription, neurotransmission. Its cellular presence is regulated by various channels and pumps to accurately maintain spatiotemporal Ca2+ concentration. Inositol trisphosphate Receptor (IP3R) is one of the proteins that regulate intracellular Ca2+ signalling in response to extracellular stimuli. Extracellular stimuli activate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to generate second messengers like Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) that binds to the IP3R on endoplasmic reticular (ER) membranes and mediate release of Ca2+ from the ER. Reported autosomal dominant mutations in IP3R1 cause Spinocerebellar ataxia 29, characterized by cerebellar atrophy, ataxia and cognitive impairment. Studies have shown that these mutations decrease Ca2+ release from the ER. However, downstream cellular mechanism(s) by which IP3Rs modulate neuronal function for specific behaviours remain speculative, in vertebrates and invertebrates. Previous genetic studies in Drosophila have revealed a role of IP3R mediated Ca2+ signalling in the formation and regulation of flight circuit. I used Drosophila neurons as a model system to understand the neuronal functions of IP3R mediated Ca2+ release. I generated an inducible dominant negative form of the IP3R (IP3RDN). Flies with neuronal expression of IP3RDN exhibit flight deficits. I used IP3RDN to identify key flight-modulating dopaminergic neurons with axonal projections in the mushroom body. Flies with attenuated IP3RDN in these dopaminergic neurons exhibit shortened flight bouts and a disinterest in seeking food. Further experiments showed reduced excitability as well as reduced dopamine release upon cholinergic stimulation as underlying cellular mechanisms. Findings in the thesis suggest that various neuromodulatory signals received by these neurons stimulate IP3/Ca2+ signals to regulate pre-synaptic cellular physiology with significant impact on flight and feeding behavior. I further investigated another IP3R dependent flight regulatory mechanism independent of dopaminergic neurons. It showed role of IP3R in neuropeptidergic neurons to release Insulin-like peptide (dILP3) to regulate flight bout durations. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Activity dependent synaptic structural changes is a key mechanism underlying learning and memory. With advances in high throughput sequencing technologies and functional profiling methods, multiple long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been linked with neurobiological processes related with learning and memory, as well as with disorders that lead to memory impairments. However, their specific roles in synapse function and plasticity are poorly understood. I will discuss the physiological regulation of sub-cellular expression, mechanism, and functions of lncRNAs in synaptic structural plasticity. | | Organ transplantation remains the only life-saving procedure for many end-stage organ failures, but is associated with two rate-limiting factors. Firstly, to find a suitable donor (other than in cases of identical twins) is very difficult and severely restricted in availability. Secondly, all patients undergoing transplantation are subjected to immunosuppression using a cocktail of drugs that often results in a high degree of susceptibility to opportunistic infections and malignancies. Similarly, patients suffering from autoimmune disorders are currently being treated with non-selective immunosuppressive therapies thereby greatly increasing the risk for infections and cancer. Using a mouse model of coronin 1 deficiency, we have been analyzing the role of T cells and coronin 1 signaling in generation of immune responses against allo-antigenic, auto-antigenic and pathogenic stimuli. In my presentation, I will provide some exciting data that shows coronin 1 deficiency could be used to promote allograft tolerance, suppress autoimmune diseases and at the same time preserve anti-pathogen responses. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Microbial cells need to make decisions crucial for their survival. Microbes also often exist in collectives such as populations and communities. The interactions between individual decision-making microbes in such collectives result in emergent properties and vital microbial functions. The population-level phenomena in turn influence the evolution of individual decision-making ability. Connecting these two scales is a vital challenge in the study of microbial life. My thesis focuses on mathematical modeling approaches to connect these regimes in two different biological systems: (i) Temperate phage-bacteria systems like lambda phage and its host, E.coli, and (ii) the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae. The first part of my thesis tries to explain the surprisingly narrow range of a complex decision-making phenotype across a variety of temperate phages. Temperate phages have two modes of propagation upon infection - (i) lysis, where the host cell dies releasing hundreds of phage particles, and (ii) lysogeny, where the phage\u00e2s genome integrates with the host\u00e2s. The choice between the two outcomes depends on how the host physiology interacts with complex genetic circuits encoded on the phage genome. A simplified view of the decision defines lysogenic propensity as the chance that an infected cell will become lysogenic. The range of observed lysogenic propensities is just 5-15%, despite the diversity of phages. To explain this narrow range, we suggest that the population dynamics of phage-bacteria infections might exert an optimising pressure on the lysogenic propensity. We combined Lotka-Volterra equations and game theory to model competitive infections to search for optimal lysogeny phenotypes. We identified the optima and found that our predicted range coincided with experimentally reported values. Bolstered by this result, we derived a mathematical expression for lysogeny by analyzing the infection dynamics [1]. For the next part of my thesis, I collaborated with Dr. Sunil Laxman\u00e2s group to investigate the unexpected emergence and spatial self-organization of metabolically distinct subpopulations in isogenic S.cerevisiae colonies. Preliminary observations in Sunil\u00e2s lab showed that glycolytic cells emerged in mature colonies grown under low glucose conditions, a novel finding. To piece together the biochemical and fluorescence-based experimental evidence, I designed a discrete spatial model of the colony. The model, albeit phenomenological, suggested simple local rules of metabolic resource sharing, resource diffusion, and metabolic switching that were sufficient to explain the patterns of colony development. The model also made predictions about the dynamics of switching and metabolic resource budgeting that the experimentalists verified [2, 3].
