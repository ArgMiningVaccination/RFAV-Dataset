Women who received flu vaccine while pregnant? Okay. There seems to be a huge lack in research and credible studies (CDC studies do not count as credible) that say if it's actually safe to receive a flu vaccine during pregnancy. So, I decided to do my own little study here. How many women received a flu vaccine during pregnancy and went on to have a healthy child that is now past 3 years of age? And how many received the vaccine during pregnancy, who now have a child that is not healthy? [5 Similar Discussions Found](//www.whattoexpect.com/search?tab=community&q=Women+who+received+flu+vaccine+while+pregnant%3F) Drs have stats that are going to be much more credible than a post in this forum. Talk to your doctor. The flu has proven to cause serious defects in babies still in the womb. Get the shot. I'm not asking for people's advice or opinions on the flu vaccine during pregnancy. Let me repeat: DID YOU RECEIVE THE FLU SHOT DURING PREGNANCY? If so, is your child now 3 years or older and okay? Or no? Simple yes or no here. No flu shot debates please. We all know there are enough of those on these forums. Then maybe you shouldn't have posted on a *** debate board. Yes I got a flu shot. My child is 3.5 and perfectly healthy. Yes, I received the flu vaccine four years ago when I was pregnant. I got the flu and it was really bad. My daughter is okay. Why don't CDC studies count as credible? \"Vaccine companies\"? You mean medical research schools and organizations that make literally a drop in the bucket from vaccines when it makes more profit to let people very sick? I had the flu vaccine when I was pregnant with my son, he is over 3 and perfectly healthy. I think that this is a garbage thread, and you are paranoid and a crazy anti vaxer more than likely. Don't sore garbage on the internet, get your information from reliable sources such as the CDC and medical studies from actual medical journals. I didn't get it until birth Oh this thread is good You're still pregnant! Yay!!! :) :) :) Aw I'm so glad!!!! Keep cooking little one :) I'm still pregnant with number 3!! Thank you :) I have been pregnant 3 times and received the flu shot all three pregnancies. All positive experiences. Is it ok to post on a debate board, and then rudely inform responders that you don't them to respond with debate or opinion? You could have posted on the Toddler Years, Preschool Years, School Age Years, or Kids' Health boards. You came to a debate board, put up a post about a hotly debated topic, got responses that aligned with debate/opinion, and then posted in a condescending fashion to the posters who had responded according to the board style. So, no, it's not ok. I'll apologize for cursing, and for the abrupt nature of my post. That's really not my usual style. I should have simply redirected you to the more appropriate forums for this type of enquiry. But I stand by my thesis, which is that if you don't want to get a majority of responses to a topic to be in the style of debate, don't post on a board for opinion and debate. You'll just waste your time redirecting and being condescending. If your non-scientific poll on here actually shows that most people have healthy kids after getting the flu shot while pregnant will you do it? If so, then yes, I received the flu shot both times I was pregnant and my children are both over 3 years old and healthy. If not, then why did you ask to begin with? I'm asking for people's input. Not here to argue what people's thoughts are about the vaccine. Is that okay?? CDC Is highly tied with the vaccine companies. But again, I don't want to get into all the side issues here. Simply asking... people's outcome from receiving the vaccine during pregnancy. That's it. If you don't want to partake.. bye. No I refused the flu vaccine with both my kids. I'm a nurse and would never not vaccinate however with my first pregnancy I miscarried shortly after I received the flu vaccine. So I did not get it when I was pregnant again the second and third time. I still refuse it every year despite not being pregnant. I read that is a common thing. I'm so sorry for your loss :( It is not \"common\" to experience loss after getting the flu shot. In fact in 2010 there were 78/1 million people reporting loss after the flu shot. I wouldn't call that common. Oh please, for the autistic comment. It's been disproven so many times. Also here's my source. Not from CDC Yes got it with all three of my children. My daughters are 11 and 13 and my son is 18 months. I believe CDC over strangers though. You posted on a debate board trust me your not going to get what your looking for. Here's why anti-vax sites are full of propaganda... Simply that there are autism spectrum disorders and people want something to blame. Charlatans who hock \"natural\" remedies exploit the fears of parents. And anti-vax sites are their advertising tool. The fact that they try to discredit the CDC is telling. Mostly because their feelings and emotions don't hold up to hard science. Since truth destroys their credibility (and profits!!), they set out to destroy the truth itself. No one bothers to ask why autism spectrum disorders have become so prominent since 1983. And the truth is that autism as a diagnosis virtually didn't exist until then. Before that, they were mischaracterized as \"bad\" children, or as forms of mental retardation, or psychosis. But history yields autistic people everywhere if the symptoms are examined. Isaac Newton, inventor of differential calculus, discoverer of gravity, and the person who first recognized light as a spectrum has been theorized to be on the high end of the autism spectrum. Albert Einstein, who discovered relativity and gravitational waves has been theorized based on his personality quirks and habits to have had Aspbergers. But anti-vaxxers propaganda and profits are made off of keeping people afraid of autism. Vaxxed came out just coincidentally after people started smelling the bullshit surrounding the anti-vaxxer movement when hundreds were sickened with measles from exposure at Disneyland in 2014. They needed a big scary propaganda reel to terrify parents and revive interest. So people with vested monetary interests (speaking engagements, homeopathic/herbal/other \"natural\" remedies to sell) made the movie to expand their anti-vax cult and corral the faithful. In my humble opinion, even if autism and vaccines were linked (which they are NOT), I'd rather have an autistic child than a baby who died of whooping cough or who was maimed by measles. Well watching Vaxxed was your first mistake... Honestly.. anti vax sites. I also watched the documentary vaxxed. I was 100% certain I wasn't going to vaccinate. Now I don't know. Where are you reading this propaganda?! Great thanks for your input! Oh and all three are perfectly healthy. I have received the flu vax with all of my pregnancies. No problems here; the paediatric surgeon says that unicorn-horns are all the rage these days, but we can go ahead and have them removed if we really feel it's necessary. You're on a debate board girl. Telling people not to debate on a board specifically for debating seems like a waste of time to me. \" It's alarming after seeing a site where every woman explains their children who they were pregnant with while receiving the flu vaccine, are now autistic.\" must be the same site that sponsors VAXXED. I miscarried my first two pregnancies, during which I did NOT receive the flu vaccine (wasn't the right time of year for it). I'm currently in my third pregnancy, during which I DID receive the flu vaccine, and I didn't miscarry. Boom, proof flu shots prevent miscarriage. If that statement sounds ridiculous to you, then so should the women who say the fact that they or their child got a vaccine and now is autistic or impaired in any capacity. One person's experience does not mean make something a fact. Even if multiple people report the same experience. You're totally right and I feel a little silly now for posting this thread. I can't honestly say tho I feel at ease after everyone's comments so I am greatly appreciative. I received the flu shot for both pregnancies and have two healthy children, a 3 year old and 6 month old. I also make sure my children get the flu shot when they are old enough. You can't use a poll like this to determine whether or not the flu shot is safe or not. You cannot make any correlation between the flu shot during pregnancy and the outcome of the child based on everyone's experiences. A scientific, peer reviewed study would be the best research along with recommendations from health care professionals are what you should base your decision. Done! Haha I def need one asap I promise I haven't made up my mind yet. I just legit started worrying reading these stories from women who received the flu shot while pregnant. I really do appreciate you sharing your experience and putting my mind at ease. I know you're right! It's just anxiety. And reading those sites just adds a tremendous unnecessary amount of more unneeded anxiety. I will look more closely into the tdap shot. I know I wouldn't be able to live with myself if something like that did happen and my baby didn't survive. I just don't get why the anti vaccine sites have SO many scary stories. It literally scares me so much to the point it makes me cry. But problem solved. I'm staying off those. You already got the flu shot? Oh honey, don't do this to yourself! This is totally your anxiety trying to find reasons to justify feeling anxious about the fact that you got the shot. You did a good thing for your baby getting that shot. My son is too young for your purposes (he's 6 weeks) but he's healthy and huge and I feel good that I've done what I can to try to keep him healthy since he's so young during cold and flu season. And please, please, please get the TDAP! There are always whooping cough outbreaks in my area and babies die from it. Think of what a modern miracle it is that we have this simple shot that can prevent your baby from suffering a painful death. Don't let the internet conspiracy theories get to you. It's not common to miscarry or have a child with autism after receiving the flu vaccine. My God what an ignorant thing to say. I have a 6, 3, and 5 month old. I had the shot with them. My kids have been sick maybe twice their whole lives. They also received all of their vaccines on schedule, including the flu shot. I would urge you to vaccinate, but I can see that won't happen. Get a home Doppler, I got mine for $20 and it gave me such peace of mined when it came to baby. :) [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S3oZrMGDMMw](//m.youtube.com/watch?v=S3oZrMGDMMw) There's what whooping cough Looks like in an infant. But trust me. I know I'm probably the crazy one. It's just the unknown and stress is enough to put me over the edge at this point. I did not get the flu shot. I did get the tdap. True. Haha no hard feelings I wasn't being nasty. You can't dictate how anyone responds, anyway. Of course if you go to antivax websites you're going to find only women who got the flu shot while pregnant whose children died or are autistic. This does NOT represent the majority in any way. Seek out unbiased, reputable sources for vaccine information. I'm gathering that you are already antivax though, so I doubt that anything anyone says on here will Change your mind. My son is nine months old, and I did receive the flu vaccine while pregnant. He has received his flu shot this year, as have my husband and I. I have many many many friends who have children over the age of three, all who received the flu vaccine while pregnant and none of their children are autistic, for whatever that is worth. I don't get why people have to get SO NASTY when I'm simply asking for people's experiences especially whenever it's regarding vaccines. Get lost. Thanks I know you're probably right. I shouldn't be reading too far into now that I already have received it and what's done is done. It just worries me is all. But I appreciate everyone helping and contributing with their experiences giving me peace of mind. Yep. This \"study\" is skewed. OP is setting herself up for flawed data. FWIW, I wouldn't go off of anecdotal posts on the internet. Women that have no issue with the flu vaccine are less likely to make posts about it, so whatever you're reading is inherently skewed. I'm very pro-vaccination, but the flu vaccine they recommend during pregnancy is really for the benefit of your baby, not society in general, so if you're worried about it, just don't get it. They recommend it because the flu can be deadly for newborns. Vaccines don't cause autism but I know that that lie is pretty much engraved in people's brains now. Ya I see that now... just thought I'd try to get women who could have a mature, calm discussion and give me their input. It's alarming after seeing a site where every woman explains their children who they were pregnant with while receiving the flu vaccine, are now autistic. And the ones they didn't receive it with, are fine. There's no study such as this performed so I thought I'd try and do my own little research. Guess not :/ I had the flu vaccine with my second and he died, but not as a result of the vaccine. You shouldn't post your questions or opinions on a debate board if you don't want to be argued with. Debate boards always have people with ODD. You can say something as obvious as \"the sky is blue\" and someone will argue. You should talk to your doctor about whether or not to get the flu shot. There are risks and benefits to any medical procedure, it's up to you to decide if the benefits outweigh the risks for you. 3 pregnancies, all within the last 11 years. I had the flu vaccine while pregnant with all 3. All perfectly healthy.
