In two notable ways, some of these letters differ from letters we've sent to other marketers pitching products advertised to prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19. First, letters sent after the effective date of the [COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/covid-19-consumer-protection-act-2021-consolidated-appropriations-act) warn marketers that anyone who makes deceptive claims about the treatment, cure, prevention, or mitigation of COVID-19 is subject to civil penalties of up to $43,792 per violation. But even advertisers that didn't get a letter should heed that loud-and-clear warning. The FTC has already filed its [first action under the new law](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2021/04/first-ftc-case-filed-under-new-covid-19-consumer-protection), asking the Court to impose civil penalties. The FTC is monitoring the marketplace closely and - to quote [recent FTC testimony before Congress](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1589396/p180500senatecovidconstestimony04272021.pdf) - will use the new law \"to intensify our efforts to protect consumers from unscrupulous actors that seek to exploit the pandemic and its economic fallout.\" In response to the warning letters, it looks like all 30 companies have removed their questionable claims. But the resounding message to others is to take down your COVID misrepresentations now. Second, if you scroll down to the bottom of letters sent since April 1st, you'll see something interesting in the cc: field.
