When you think or hear meditation, you may envision sitting with crossed legs, eyes closed, and a feeling of calmness. But what about scent? We've developed a list of the best essential oils for meditation to help you stay mindful and in the zone. Meditation can be different for everyone, but generally, it refers to the practice of contemplation or reflection. Aromatherapy is a great way to complement your meditation practice, particularly by using oils that help to center the mind. This post looks at some of the best meditation essential oils. In this post, we will look at the benefits of using essential oils for meditation and discuss what we believe the best essential oils for meditation are and how to use them. Good luck with your practice! What is The Purpose of Meditation? We have three main speeds of brain waves. In alpha, we are concentrating and engaged. In beta, we are not necessarily focusing and are relaxed; our brain enters a theta state in sleep. In a theta state, our conscious mind is quieter, so our unconscious can speak. We are more relaxed, creative, and intuitive in this meditative state. We feel more connected to the universe and the divine in this state. A study published in the journal Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology examined the effects of two different kinds of meditation on the body. Zazen is a seated meditation believed to calm the body and mind. Tai Chi is a moving meditation. The participants were assessed for the effects of the meditation via a psychological questionnaire to evaluate the effects of both techniques on personality structure, emotional intelligence, mood, and coping with stress. Both meditations significantly enhanced openness to experience, which is associated with improved strategies for dealing with stress. Meditators exhibited less tendency to try to avoid stress when they perceived it. Their mood was seen to be better when compared to the control group, who had not been meditating. ( [Pokorski, 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28647925/)) Early science suggests that meditation may be able to prolong life-based on its effects on tiny portions of DNA found at the end of chromosomes. Telomeres protect the ends of chromosomes from becoming frayed or tangled. Telomeres become slightly smaller every time a cell divides. Eventually, they shorten so much that it would be impossible for the cell to divide anymore, and then the cell dies. Telemeres are seen as reliable biomarkers for worsening health and early death. Research by the University of Australia shows that meditation may protect against telemere death and shortening. ( [Schutte, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31903785/)) How to Meditate Spiritually? Religion is a standardized dogma of spirituality. It is a cannon of beliefs around a prophet or way of being. It encompasses the buildings that worship is conducted in, the sacred texts, and songs. Religion is a set text of how to teach yourself spiritually in a specific set of beliefs. Spirituality is more about finding your way of connecting with what you perceive as divine. For some, that might connect with nature; for others, that might be about learning more about themselves or how they can be a better version of themselves. All that is required to meditate is to slow the mind down. Usually, this is done by focussing on breathing, although music and essential oils can help. Thinking about essential oils' spiritual meanings can also help you focus your mind in the right direction. An essential part of meditation is clarity about what you are trying to achieve. Often it is easier to visualize where you want to go with it than asking your brain to be quiet. Great essential oils for intention setting are neroli and sweet basil. They are great for helping you connect truthfully with what you want to achieve. Neroli combines manifestation - understanding that your thoughts can become things, and sweet basil forces you to stop procrastinating and to get on and do it.

Using oils topically means that in addition to reaping the benefits of aromatherapy, you also receive any potential benefits to the skin. For example, lavender and frankincense oil are both reputed to help reduce signs of aging, including sun damage and fine lines. Other oils may help ease [sore muscles](https://www.vinevida.com/blogs/our-blog/10-best-essential-oils-for-sore-muscles) and joints. Inhalation If you don't wish to apply oils to topically, you can also use inhalation. The most common way to inhale the aroma of oils is through diffusion. There are both passive and active methods of diffusion, and both work to spread the scent of oils around a room. This works great for meditation as it helps to create a calming atmosphere. If you want to try using the best essential oils for meditation via diffusion, here are a few methods to consider: TISSUE INHALATION All you have to do for this method is place a few drops of your favorite essential oil on a piece of tissue paper, and voila! Add 2-3 drops to the tissue paper and wave it near to your nose. This is a great method to use if you share your space with others, as some people have sensitivities to certain fragrances. You can also sniff oils directly from the bottle, for a quick burst of aroma. STEAM DIFFUSION A steam diffuser blends oil and water together to create either a cold or warm mist that is diffused into the air. It is one of the most popular methods of diffusion and is suitable if you're meditating in a room where just a small amount of air can enter or exit. If you don't want to go to the extent of purchasing a diffuser, you can also use a pot of boiled water, adding in a few drops of oil. Cover with a lid, letting the steam build up, and then (safely) release it in the area you wish to meditate. The Best Essential Oils for Meditation: Precautions to Consider Though essential oils can be a great addition to your meditation practice, it is important to make sure you are using them safely and sustainably. A few important precautions to take are: - Never ingest essential oils, as they are extremely potent - Always dilute oils first before applying topically. For adults, this means 6-10 drops for every ounce of carrier oil - If you notice any discomfort while using (such as headaches) it's best to discontinue use, as some people have allergies and sensitivities to essential oils Conclusion There is a deep connection between essential oil and mindfulness. With our list of the best essential oils for meditation, we hope that you will find the perfect oil for your practice. Whether you choose to use topical application, or diffusion, ensure that you always follow proper guidelines for use.
