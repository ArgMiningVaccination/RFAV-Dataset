GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 3 II. Executive Summary Qingyuan County with rich forest and species resources, located in the southwest mountain area of Zhejiang Province, is the county -level administrative area with the best ecological environment in China and one of China's 17 key regions of global significance for biodiversity. Located in the northern mountain area of Qingyuan County, Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System (QFMCS), formed from the mushroom cultivation through rational use of forest resource s by Gumin (referring to the farmers who mainly cultivate mushrooms) for thousands of years, is an agroforestry system in high mountainous region, focusing on the sustainable forest management, development of mushroom industry and resource cyclic utilization, includ ing the unique forest and mushroom co -culture technique, rich forest ecological culture and mushroom culture, and the ecological landscape with reasonable structure. QFMCS is the guarantee of food and livelihood security for local residents living in the h igh mountain areas , the birthplace of Xianggu (a kind of mushroom, also called shii-take; the scientific name is Lentinus edodes ) cultivation technique, the base of the inheritance and spread of forest and mushroom co -culture technique and culture. Because of high mountains and dense forests, less cultivated land and inconvenient transportation, there are few ways for local residents to make a living. Through forest conservation, mushroom cultivation and agricultural production, local residents have achieve d the food and livelihood security, and created the forest and mushroom co - culture technique system of harmonious co -existence between human and nature , and keeps a complete cultivation technique evolution chain from Duohua (chopping a small slit in a fall en tree) method to wood log method and then to substitute material method, formed rich forest ecological culture and mushroom culture, as well as a rational structure of land use types and ecological landscape. Meanwhile, the site is a key area for the ori gin and evolution of flora in East China, the only distribution area of relict plant Abies beshanzuensis in the world, and an important distribution area of wild macro fungus resources in China. Just relying on the QFMCS, the livelihood security of local residents has been guaranteed, the farming culture has been continued and inherited, and the harmonious development between man and nature has been realized. The unique mountain utilization mode and creative ecological cycle of QFMCS mode are of great signi ficance to deal with the serious destruction of forest resources, decrease of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystem services , increasingly contradiction between ecological conservation and economic development, poverty and food security, etc. The forest c onservation thoughts and ecological cycle mode of forest and GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 4 mushroom co -culture, formed by Gumin based on the ecological principle of mutual benefit and symbiosis between forest and fungi, not only effectively protects the biodiversity and ecological envi ronment, but also is in line with the current concept of sustainable development. Meanwhile, a series of agricultural and forestry products with mushrooms as the core guarantee the needs of food and nutrition of local residents, and diversified industries have contributed to the development of local economies and the alleviation of poverty among farmers in mountain areas. What's more, the mushroom cultivation technique promoted the development of mushroom industry worldwide. QFMCS is also facing some threa ts and challenges due to rapid urbanization and industrialization, introduction of modern production technologies, relative shortage of labor force and low efficiency of agricultural production. Since it has been listed as a China Nationally Important Agri cultural Heritage System (China -NIAHS) in 2014, local government and Gumin have attached great importance to it, which brings this heritage system a new turning point. It is believed that the recognition of GIAHS will promote the protection, inheritance an d development of QFMCS, and also provide demonstration for the world on forest conservation, mushroom cultivation and multi - functional agricultural and forestry development in mountain areas. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 5 III. Significance of the Proposed Site 1 Specific Features of the Proposed Site as Global Importance 1.1 Description of the Proposed System The site is located in the mountainous area of southwest Zhejiang, with various landforms such as valley, basin, hill and mountain. Both sides of the river are mostly high mountains and deep valleys, with a relative height of about 1000 m above sea level. Meanwhile, the subtropical monsoon climate with four distinct seasons enables the site to have abundant rainfall, no severe cold in winter and no severe heat in summer, and large temperature difference between day and night. Such topography and climatic conditions are very conducive to the formatio n of mushroom fruiting bodies. For thousands of years, local residents made rational use of forest resources to cultivate mushroom s, invented and developed an agroforestry system with mushroom and forest co -culture technique as the core, forest conservation, mushroom cultivation and agricultural production integrated organically, formed a rational land use type and ecological landscape with forest, terrace, village and river cooperating with each other (Figure 1). As a habitat of wild animals and plants, the forests not only offer local residents traditional mushroom production sites, mushroom cultivation materials, forest products and herbal medicine, but also provide important ecosystem services such as soil and water conservation, biodiversity and climate regulation. Terraces accept and consume the waste of mushroom production, guarantee the food supply of local residents such as grains and vegetables. Villages provide living places for residents and processing places for agricultural and forest ry products. The rivers meet the demand for production and living water, providing aquatic products for local residents and serving as a transportation channel in history. All the components coordinate with each other to maintain the stability and sustaina ble development of the ecosystem. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 6 Figure 1 Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System, formed from the mushroom cultivation through rational use of forest resource s by local residents for thousands of years, is an agroforestry system in high mountainous region. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 7 QFMCS has unique mountain utilization mode and creative ecological cycle mode, and its most unique ecological value is to realize \"zero\" pollution to the ecological environment. Throughout the herita ge system, the forests provide a growing environment and nutrients for edible fungi, which accelerate the decomposition of organic matter in the forests, and the decomposition of dead woods and litters increases the nutrients in the forests. Trees and logg ing residues use as raw materials for mushroom cultivation. Forest litters are burned and spread on farmland to prevent the plant diseases and insect pests and enhance the soil fertility. Farmland produces all kinds of agricultural products, and its crop s traw can be mulched to increase soil fertility, or mixed into culture materials for mushroom cultivation. After recycl ing, the remaining culture material can be used for mushroom cultivation again, or used as organic fertilizer for farmland, or burned to b ake mushroom, or used as livestock feed to feed livestock. The excrements of livestock and poultry are collected and applied to farmland to increase soil nutrients. Nutrients and production wastes in the system are recycled in the system over and over agai n without causing pollution to the ecological environment outside the system, which plays an important role in protecting the ecological environment and promoting sustainable economic development. 1.2 Features According to the GIAHS Selection Criteria Firstly, it guarantees the food and livelihood security of local residents. Through various production methods such as forest resource cultivation and utilization, collection of wild resources under the forests, planting and breeding in the farmlands and u nder the forests, intercropping and interplanting of forests and crops , a variety of agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery products , such as mushrooms, forest trees, nuts, fruits, oil plants, traditional Chinese herbal medicines, cereals, potatoes, vegetables and aquatic products, are produced to meet the food, nutrition and daily life needs of local residents . On this basis, agricultural experience, cultural education, eco -tourism and other new forms of business are extended. Traditional industries and new forms of business continue to merge, which greatly increased the output of agriculture and the income of farmers , and contributed to meeting the requirements of the continuous improvement of local people's living standards. According to the statistical data, the Farmers' income from the QFMCS accounts for 46.9%, which is an important livelihood source for local people. Secondly, it preserves rich biodiversity, especially the diversity of fungi resources. There have a large number of native o r semi -native forest vegetation in the site, which preserves many primitive and ancient biological populations. Because of the rich forest resources, animal and plant resources are abundant and many of them are rare and GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 8 endangered creatures. The site is an important fungal resource bank in China , rich in wild fungus resources and genetic diversity, and 398 species of macro fungi have been identified. Superior geographical location and climatic conditions of the site provides excellent conditions for the gro wth of many crops. At present, there are about 60 kinds of main cultivated crops in the site . Many of them are local traditional varieties. Thirdly, it contains a relatively perfect and harmonious technical system of forest and mushroom co -culture. The traditional knowledge and techniques formed by Gumin , such as natural forest conservation, mushroom forest management , forest utilization, utilization of resources under the forest and resource cyclic utilization, which help to realize the organic int egration of forest conservation, mushroom cultivation and agricultural production. In the production process, the waste such as forest logging residues, crop straw, mushroom dregs, excrement of livestock and poultry, etc., have been recycled , which is a ty pical model of ecological circular agriculture. D uring t he whole production process and postpartum processing and utilization , wastes have not been discharged to the environment, thus achieving the objective of comprehensive, cyclic and green utilization. The site is also the birthplace of Xianggu cultivation technique and keeps a complete cultivation technique evolution chain from Duohua to wood log and then to substitute material methods, which can be called \"The Living Museum of Mushroom Cultivation Tech nologies\". Fourthly, it has bred rich and diverse farming cultures. Gumin have worked in mountain forests for generations, created a unique language and customs and wrote lots of folk ballads, proverbs, and legendary stories to reflect the bitterness and j oy of Gumin experienced in the process of cultivating mushroom. All such things have derived a distinctive forest ecological culture and mushroom culture with local characteristics. The most typical culture is centered on the natural worship of mountain fo rests such as worshiping Shanshen (the god of mountain), acknowledging Shuniang (taking a tree as a mother), sacrificing Fengshui forest, etc.; the ancestor worship of Gushen (the god of mushroom, namely Wu Sangong) such as Gushen Temple Fair, Xiyang Templ e, Wu Sangong Ancestral Temple, etc.; the folk customs focusing on confidentiality and inheritance of cultivation techniques and personal safety protection such as Gushan (forests used for the Duohua method mushroom cultivation ) Dialect, Xianggu Kungku , etc., architectural art focusing on harmonious interpersonal relationship and convenient market transaction such as Langqiao (Corridor Bridge); social organizations focusing on cooperation and mutual assistance such as Sanhe hall, mushroom guild, etc. Fifthly, it embodies the rational structure of land use types and ecological landscape perfectly. There have rich landscape types, and forest is the dominant landscape type. \"Forest -Terrace -Village -River\" was successively distributed from high mountains to GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 9 river valleys. Villages are generally built along the river valleys near water sources , terraces are often distributed in the areas between the villages and mountainside with relatively gentle slope, and forests are distributed in the areas with steep slo pes. The unique geographical environment of \" 90% of the area is covered with mountains , 5% with water and 5% with field\" and the corresponding production methods together in the site formed the spatial pattern of forests dominated, dense streams, rare crop lands, as well as village, artificial mushroom forests and mushroom cultivation scattered distribution. There also have many cultural landscapes such as ancient village, ancient bridge, ancient road and ancient architecture. Especially, Langqiao constructi on is unique in the world. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 10 2 Contemporary Relevance 2.1 Contribution to the Sustainable Agricultural Development in Mountainous Areas The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the United Nations in 2030 include to eliminate hunger, realize food security, improve nutrition condition and promote sustainable agriculture, etc. QFMCS can provide an important reference for the realization of SDG (Table 1). Compared with plain areas, the livelihood of farmers in mountain areas faces more ri sks and uncertainties, and it is more difficult to achieve sustainable development. The site is a typical alpine area in China, in which rich forest resources play an important role in water conservation and continuously provide sufficient clean water resources for downstream areas. T he forest and mushroom co - culture technique realized the coordinated development of forest resources conservation and mushroom industry in the site. Relying on QFMCS, a variety of industries including agricultural production, processing and sales, as well as forest and rural cultural tourism has been formed, and the absolute poverty of \"less than 4,600 RMB Yuan \" was eliminated in 2015 in the site. Meanwhile, the cultivation of mushroom is not difficult, which is the main way of making a living for stay -at-home women in the site. The cultivation technique of mushroom has also promoted the development of mushroom industry worldwide. What's more, the mushroom is a good source of protein and amino acid because of their high protein content and a full range of amino acids. 2.2 Contribution to the Conservation of Biocultural Diversity In the Convention on Biological Diversity , the protection of biological diversity is recognized as a common concern of all mankind, and it is also one of the sustainable development goals of the United Nations in 2030 to restrain the loss of biological diversity. The site is a key area for the origin and evolution of flora in East China, and an important natural ecological barrier in Zhejiang and even East China. Ten thousand mu (1 mu equals to 666.67 m2) of typical zonal natural forests have been preserved up to now and a lot of primitive and ancient biological populations have been preserved, providing a stable habitat for more than 100 kinds of rare and endangered wild plants. At th e same time, there have very rich fungus resources, because the special geological and geomorphic differences of the site not only create conditions for biodiversity, but also provide a good space and environment for the diversity of fungus species and the ir reproduction and evolution. Therefore, the site is of great significance to China and the world in terms of biodiversity and gene resource protection. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 11 Table 1 Comparison between QFMCS and the Sustainable Development Goals of the Unit ed Nations in 2030 Sustainable Development Goals The Proposed Site Goal 1: No Poverty The absolute poverty of \"less than 4,600 RMB Yuan \" was eliminated in 2015 in the site. Goal 2: Zero Hunger QFMCS guarantees the food and livelihood security of local residents through different production methods . Goal 3: Good Health and Well -Being Mushroom are good sources of protein and amino acids. Goal 4: Quality Education Goal 5: Gender Equality The cultivation of mushroom is not difficult, which is the main w ay of making a living for stay -at-home women in the site. Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation Rich forest resources play an important role in water conservation and continuously provide sufficient clean water resources for downstream areas Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth Relying on QFMCS, the site has formed a variety of industries including agricultural production, processing and sales, as well as forest and rural cultural tourism. Goal 9: Industry, I nnovation, and Infrastructure Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities The mushroom cultivation technique promoted the development of mushroom industry worldwide. Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production The resource cyclic utilization patterns formed by the Gumin help to realize the perfect harmony of forest resource conservation and mushroom industry development. Goal 13: Climate Action The recognition of GIAHS will help to protect the ecological enviro nment. Goal 14: Life Below Water Goal 15: Life on Land The forest and mushroom co -culture technique system has realized the harmony between man and nature. Goal 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions Goal 17: Partnerships GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 12 Cultural diversity is the common heritage of human beings. Thousands of years of forest conservation and mushroom cultivation in the site have bred rich forest ecological culture and mushroom culture . These cultures are v ivid and plain, and form the rich connotation of QFMCS . They have greatly enriched the cultural diversity of human beings and should be cherished and maintained for the benefit of all mankind. 2.3 Contribution to Enriching Ecosystem Management Practice When cut ting the mushroom trees, Gumin in the site followed the strict selection principle of the mountain forests and mushroom trees, and only chose to cut the big trees. In addition , the appropriate management and protection measures are taken to promote the for est renewal. Owing to the reasonable natural forest protection technique, the cutting volume is always kept to be less than the growth volume. For thousands of years, no forests were destroyed due to the production of mushroom. Generally, logging is carried out regardless of time period, season, and ecological choice. But cut ting mushroom tree s must be carried out in winter. First ly, the trees cut down in the period of dormancy have sufficient nutrients stored in the tree body . The bark is close to th e trunk, and it is not easy to peel off. Second ly, the trees cut down in the period of dormancy are easy to sprout and renew. Because the mushroom cultivation is highly harmonious to the forest ecosystem, the forest land after cultivating mushroom is growi ng better and better. Many Gumin cultivated mushrooms in mountain forests by generations, forming the best mountain forests with alternation of generations. D ue to special cutting operation and behavior in the mountain forests , QFMCS maintains a high degre e of harmony between human and nature . Therefore, it has a strong vitality and is a model of sustainable management of forest ecosystem . 2.4 Contribution to Promoting the Spread of F orest and Mushroom Co-culture Techniques Throughout the ages, the developm ent and transmission of science and technology have driven the progress of human society. At present, traditional and modern cultivation techniques coexist in QFMCS, which formed the most complete technique system of forest resource conservation and mushro om cultivation and made it the best inheritance and transmission carrier for forest and mushroom co -culture technique. For thousands of years, the forest and mushroom co -culture technique has been inherited and developed in the site and has become the main means for local people to maintain their livelihood. Gumin engaged in the production of mushrooms across the country, which covers more than 200 cities and counties in 13 provinces. Meanwhile, the ecological wisdom of forest and mushroom co -culture has al so profoundly affected the development of the mushroom industry in other countries and regions. Various GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 13 communication activities have effectively promoted the transmission of mushroom cultivation techniques from the site. Documents showed that the Tuomu method in Japan are technically similar with the Duohua method in the site. As mushroom industry is receiving more and more attention in poverty -stricken areas around the world, a comprehensive understanding of QFMCS' value has an important theoretical and practical significance for the inheritance of global farming cultures, sustainable agricultural development, and expansion of agricultural functions. 2.5 Contribution to Realizing Diet Structure of \"One Meat, One Vegetable and One Mushroom\" Diversified foo d demand has become the primary symbol of improvement of people's life quality. Fungus food is the third generation of healthy food after plant and animal food. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Health Organiza tion (WHO) have proposed that the best structure of human diet is \"one meat, one vegetable and one mushroom\". The residents in the site cultivate mushrooms with fungal spores to provide human beings with multi -purpose edible, medicinal and health care products , thus playing an important role in maintaining human food safety and improving human health. 2.6 Contribution to Rural Devel opment in the Site With the development of industrialization and urbanization, the rural labor force in the site has transf erred from agriculture to non -agricultural industry , which weakens the necessary human , material and financial resources required by the development of agriculture and rural areas . It mainly reflected in the excessive reduction of rural resident population and a large number of \"hollow villages\" in the site . At the same time, it is accompanied by aging of resident population and agricultural employees, slow development of rural industry, disappearance of traditional rural culture s, and deterioration of rura l ecological environment , as well as outflow of rural talents. QFMCS contain s rich biological, technical and cultural genes, and is of great practical significance for the rural devel opment of the site. Being an important part of the QFMCS, forest ecologi cal culture and mushroom culture is an essential part of Chinese excellent traditional cultures, and also of great significance for inheritance of farming cultures and harmony of rural society. Heritage protection in the site can boost the development of rural economy, the inheritance of local culture, the harmony of rural society, and the health of rural ecological environment , which will contribute to the implementation of rural development strategy. In addition , by exploring a path t o protect agricultural heritage system integrating economic development, ecological conservation and cultural inheritance, this heritage system can contribute to the GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 14 sustainable development of world agriculture and rural areas. 3 Historical Relevance Human beings have managed and utilized forest s consciously and unconsciously, and have experienced the evolution process from natural harvesting to artificial cultivation of mushroom in the forests, thus promot ing the formation of QFMCS with forest conservation and mushroom industry development in a coordinated way. The proposed system, located in subtropical monsoon climate zone and southern Zhejiang mountainous area , is the best representative of the system evolution and a good embodiment of the sustainable fo rest management technique and ecological cycle thought of harmonious co -existence of \"mushroom and forest\" and \"human and nature\". According to the coevolution relationship of human -forest -mushroom in the site, the development of QFMCS can be divided into four stages (Figure 2). The first stage: natural forest conservation - natural collection and utilization of fungi Human reproduction was found in the site as early as 5000 years ago, and the economic status was closed or semi -closed at that time due to high mountains and poor transportation. Because of the natural conditions of \" 90% of the area is covered with mountains, 5% with water and 5% with field \" and the long -term self -sufficiency economy, the natural forests occupy the absolute advantage, and loc al people depended on the forests for survival primarily. The mushroom widely distributed in the forests were their very important source of food. The second stage: protective utilization of natural forest - natural inoculation of mushroom With the increa se of population, the need of people for mushroom cannot be satisfied by merely natural harvesting, and then the forest management and utilization of fungus resources under the forest entered the second stage. Over 800 years ago, Wu Sangong (1130 -1208), a villager from Longyan Village , invented the Duohua method (Figure 3), a kind of Xianggu cultivation technique . It was a natural inoculation technique of Xianggu cultivation and created a precedent in the artificial cultivation and utilization of forest fun gi. After that , Xianggu began its history of benefiting human beings and Wu Sangong was honored as \" Gushen \" by descendants as well. There are about 200 to 300 tree species of suitable Xianggu cultivation selected by Gumin , which are collectively called miscellaneous trees, namely broad -leaved forests, such sustainable manag ement of mushroom forests, local farmers have strict measures to GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 15 conserve the forests. When cultivating mushroom, only older mushroom trees can be cut down, and the seedlings under the forests will be conserved carefully, thus promot ing the natural regener ation of the forests. Figure 2 Historic process of Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System. According to the coevolution relationship of human -forest -mushroom in the site, the development can be divided into four stages. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 16 Figure 3 Wu Sangong invented Duohua method, a kind of Xianggu (Lentinus edodes . Duohua in \"Chapter Fungi\" of Wang Zhen Nongs hu (one famous agricultural book published in 1313 by Wang Zhen, a great agronomist in Yuan Dynasty). The contents are as follows (Figure 4): \"This method is also used for cultivating Xianggu in the mountains, but they are oriented to shady land, and choose suitable trees such as maple, castanopsis to cut down and chop slits with axes, and cover them with earth. The trees decay with years, evenly distribute Xianggu in the cut marks, and cover them with tallow leaves and soil, water them from time to time. After days, hitting the trees with the malle t to catalyze the growth of Xianggu , which is called Jingxun . After rain, when the weather is warm, Xianggu will pop up. One may gain profits over the years, and the benefits will be hefty. Leave the seeds in the marks, and the sprout will burgeon forth ne xt year. One should spot a suitable plot of land, cultivate Xianggu with the elapse of years. The freshly picked Xianggu is delicious when cooked raw. Dry Xianggu can be got when exposed to air. The people residing in deep mountains and impoverished valley s can cultivate Xianggu , replacing farming. The natural environment makes it thrive, which generates profits.\" Because of the inve ntion of Duohua method, generations of Gumin in the site have been engaged in mushroom cultivation, and accumulated rich prac tical experience in cultivation, management and processing. The production area has been expanding and the number of employees has been increasing. During the reign of Song Jiaxi (1237 GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Province 17 A.D. -1240 A.D.), the Duohua method spread from Qingyuan to the surround ing areas of Jingning and Longquan counties. By the Ming Dynasty ( 1368 A.D. -1644 A.D.), Qingyuan mushroom was well -known and was decreed as a tribute. The Gumin 's inhabiting areas also extend to Fujian, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Anhui, Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Hu nan and Guizhou provinces. Figure 4 Record of Xianggu cultivation in ancient agricultural literature The third stage: protective utilization of natural forest and cultivation of artificial mushroom forest - equal emphasis on natural and artificial inoculation Around the 1960s, owing to the introduction of artificial strain production technique, the mushroom began to be cultivated with wood log, pressed sawdust, sawdust rod and so on, which greatly promoted the industrial development of mushroom. With the development of cultivation technique s and the increase of market demand for mushrooms, the demand for mushroom forest resources has also increas ed. To satisfy the needs of production and development, people began to cultivate mushroom forest resource s consciously, and the stage of protective utilization of natural forest and cultivation of artificial mushroom forest started . The fourth stage: substitute materials with assistance of forest trees - artificial inoculation with assistance of natural inoculation After the 1990s, benefiting from the development of cultivation techniques, the mushroom industry in the site has entered a rapid development period . Owing to t he GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 18 innovation of cultivation techniques , the utilization rate of wood has been greatly improved. The crop and waste of forest production are used as the raw material of cultivation, greatly reduc ing the dependence on mushroom forest resources. At present, the mushroom cultivation materials which come directly from natural forest and mushroom forest only account for 30% in the site . After hundred s of years of development, the utilization of forests and edible fungus resources by Gumin in the site has changed from simply obtaining woods and edible fungi to conscious forest conservat ion and mushroom cultivation, and then to making full use of all kinds of forest resources to cultivate mushroom s by means of substitute material cultivation. It has formed the pattern of co -existence of traditional technique and modern technique, and co -existence of natural forest conservation, mushroom forest cultivation, and substitute material utilization. Although the resource utilization techniques and production efficiency of QFMCS have changed in different development stages, the core thought of for est resource conservation, fungus resource conservation, resource recycling, as well as the formed culture have not changed. 4 Comparative Analysis The site has an original and complete ecosystem, a long -standing ecological culture, and rich and unique natural and cultural landscapes, as well as a rare broad -leaved forest of ten thousand mu in East China. It is also the birthplace of Oujiang River, Minjiang River and Fu'an River, the only distribution area of relict plant Abies beshanzuen sis in the world , an important distribution area of wild macro fungus germplasm resources in China. Forest and mushroom co -cuture technique has been passed down for thousands of years, and the cultivation technique of Xianggu originated from here. (1) Unique forest and mushroom co -culture technique. The continuous evolution of QFMCS is mainly due to its unique forest and mushroom co -culture technique. This technique is a kind of sustainable management technology wi th forest and mushroom compound and ecological cycle. Different measures have been taken to realize the recycling of forest resources, including the use of l arge fungi in the forest to promote the cycle of forest materials and nutrients, the reuse of residues of substitute m aterial cultivation, etc . At present, the mushroom cultivation has achieved a technological leap from Duohua to wood log and then to substitute materials methods. However, the core concept of \" forest and mushroom co -culture\" has been inherited all the time. Up to now, the forest coverage rate of the site is as high as 90%. This heritage system provides people wi th delicious food but does not destroy the natural environment, which vividly reflects the harmonious development between man and nature. (2) The birthplace of Xianggu cultivation technique in the world . There are many GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 19 descriptions of ecology or cultivatio n about macro fungi, such cocos , and Collybia velutipes in human history, especially in many historical documents of China, but only the description of Xianggu cultivation technique is the most complete and practical . It is diff erent from the cultivation of grain, cotton and hemp recorded in general historical materials, and also different from the domestication and breeding of poultry and livestock. As it fills the gap of the cultivation of fungal spores in the history of the de velopment of human agricultural civilization, it seems particularly valuable . Spores are both elusive and recognizable. It is necessary to understand the Duohua on felled trees to accept spores to colonize, germinate and grow. In order to meet the requirem ents of light, heat, water and air, the whole process is very strict and complicated, which takes two years. People cultivate Xianggu with only an axe but they can control it freely, the difficulty of which can be imagined. (3) China's important fungal re source bank . The site is of a large area of forest s, with an altitude of 240 -1856.7 m. Diverse vegetation types provide extremely favorable natural conditions for the growth of fungi, create rich wild fungus resources and genetic diversity, and make the site the most suitable area for fungus germplasm resources to be protected on -site and off -site in China. In addition, owing to the large cultivation base of mushroom and the large genetic variation of varieties in the cultivation process, rich strain resources with natural variation have been formed and give the site a natural advantage in the selection of new and fine varieties of mushroom. Abundant fungus resources also play an important role in accelerating the circulation of matter and energy, maintaining biodiversity, integrity and stability of forest ecosystem. (4) \"Living Museum\" with the most complete evolution chain of mushroom cultivation techniques . At present, 62 GIAHS sites are identified in the world and only the GIAHS site of Kunisaki Peninsula Usa Integrated Foretry, Agriculture and Fisheries System in Japan related to mushroom cultivation, in which local resi dents use wood log to cultivate mushroom s. In contrast, QFMCS keeps a complete cultivation technique evolution chain from Duohua method to wood log method and then to substitute material method, as well as retains a forest management technique system consi stent with the development of mushroom industry, which has better integrity. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 20 IV. Characteristics of the Site 1 Food and Livelihood Safety 1.1 Food Supply under Multiple Agricultural Production (1) Diversified agricultural production modes The agricultural production of the site mainly includes cultivation of mushrooms, timber and economic forests, planting and breeding in farmlands and under forests. Figure 5 Main artificial cultivation mushrooms and wild mushrooms in the -culture System in Zhejiang Province 21 The artificially cultivated mushrooms the yield of Xianggu reached up to 250.5 tons in 3.631 million bags in the site; the output of Grifola frondosa was 3.7 tons in 45,000 bags; and that of Auricularia auricula was 4.2 tons in 53,000 bags. There are also abundant wild fungi in the site, with Dictyophora indusiate, Ganoderma lucidum, Morchella esculenta and Russula vinosa utilized the most by local residents (Figure 5). The cultivation of timber and econo mic forests is common (Figure 6). Timber forests mainly include bamboo forest and mushroom forests. Almost all villages therein plant bamboo. The total area of bamboo forest is 12,526 mu. The products are bamboo timber and bamboo shoots. Mushroom forests m ainly include an area of 39,355 mu. The economic forests are diversified. Among them, Castanea henryi has been cultivated in the site for more than 200 years. Called \"iron crop\" by farmers, it is an ecotype economic forest tree species, with a total area of 496 mu. The planting of Torreya grandis , mainly wild and transplanted Torreya grandis , also has a long history with an area of 23 mu. Camellia oleifera is mo stly planted in patches with an area of 165 mu. The main varieties are small fruit camellia, pink columnar camellia and Zhejiang safflower camellia. The sweet orange pomelo cultivation herein was awarded the Agro -product Geographical Designation by the Min istry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China in 2018, and its planted area in the site is 113 mu. And kiwifruit, commonly known as \" Chenli \" has been cultivated artificially since the 1990s, reaching an area of 46 mu in 201 9. Planting and breeding under forests mainly include the planting of traditional Chinese herbal medicines and breeding of Apis cerana. Poria cocos planted under forests is a traditionally famous Chinese herbal medicine, and has reached an area of 11 mu in th e site in 201 9. Breeding of Apis cerana under forests can produce honey products of extremely high nutritional value, and meanwhile support the growth of forest plants with healthy pollination. In all, it has higher economic and ecological value. The breed ing scale in the site has reached 214 boxes. Planting and breeding in farmlands is mainly grain and vegetable planting, and aquaculture in paddy field (Figure 7). Rice is the main food crop, with a planting area of 296 mu. Eleusine coracana is tolerant of drought, floods, and barren soil, with a planting area of 31 mu. Aquatic products such as carps and field snails will simultaneously be raised in some paddy fields, with a total breeding area of 37 mu. Snails and carps are nutritious, delicious and thrive in muddy waters, with prices higher than those of similar aquatic products cultured in ponds. In addition to planting food GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 22 crops such as rice, Chenopodium quinoa, Eleusine coracana and Zizan ia latifolia , are also planted on terraces usually in spring or autumn and harvested in summer or winter. At present, a total of 517 mu of vegetables is planted, of which 380 mu are mountain vegetables (over 800 m above sea level). Figure 6 Timber forests such as bamboo forest and mushroom forest.

Bamboo forest Mushroom forest Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 23 Figure 7 Crops such as carps and field snails. (2) Food supply and nutrition security Multiple agricultural production modes within the site have brought a variety of agricultural products including mushrooms, forest trees, nuts, fruits, oil plants, traditional Chinese herbal medicines, cereals, potatoes, vegetables and aquatic products (Figure 8). In addition to forest trees and herbal medicines, all the other agricultural products can be used as food sources for local residents. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 24 Figure 8 Multiple agricultural production modes within the site bring people all kinds of products sucha as mushrooms, forest trees, nuts, fruits, oil plants, traditional Chinese herbal medicines, cereals, potatoes, vegetables and aquatic products. According to th e statistics, QFMCS can provide about 52.21 kg of mushrooms, 7.15 kg of nuts, 35.13 kg of fruit, 2.09 kg of oil plants, and 19.04 kg of cereals, 172.50 kg of potatoes, 64.16 kg of vegetables and 0.48 kg of aquatic products for each resident in the site (Ta ble 2), having served as the well -stocked \"barn\" for them. In actual consumption, local people have a strong dependence on indigenous agricultural products. According to a survey, up to 77.5% of their food is produced by this system. Mushrooms are rich in protein and amino acids and a kind of must -have food for most residents in the site. The average per capita annual consumption is 28.67 kg, much higher than that in non -mushroom production areas. Table 2 Major food products from agriculture in the site in 2019 Food type Agricultural products Production scale Output /ton Per capita share /kg Output value /ten Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 25 Food type Agricultural products Production scale Output /ton Per capita share /kg Output value /ten thousand indusiata 0.5 ha 0.08 7.5 ha 157.6 31.38 1304.7 Kiwifruit 3.1 ha 18.8 3.74 36.7 Oil plants Camellia oleifera 11.0 ha 10.5 2.09 25.9 Cereals Rice ha 116.3 23.16 118.7 Potato 8.9 ha 338.0 Aquatic products Field carp 2.0 ha 1.1 0.22 16.9 Field snail 1.4 ha 1.3 0.26 19.8 Present Knowledge in Nutrition emphasizes a \"balanced diet\" that meets the body's nutritional needs through a reasonable dietary structure. In the 1990s, WHO and FAO recommended that countries formulate \"dietary guidelines\" to guide the population to keep a well -balanced diet to obtain nutrients needed, resulting in various forms of \"food pyramids\" thereafter. In general, the \"food pyramids\" are composed of 4 to 5 categories of food, encouraging residents to consume cereals and potatoes the most, meat, egg, milk in moderation, more fruits and vegetables, and less oil and salt. This heritage system contains a variety of agricultural products, just complying with the dietary guidelines of food pyramids (Figure 9), so it can serve as a relatively comprehensive source of nutrients for residents in the site. Among others, mushrooms (such as Xianggu ) provide important nutrients for people, and has certain medicinal and health benefits; nuts (such as Castanea henryi ) have a preventive effect on cardiovascular diseas es, and can also serve to improve eyesight and boost brain power; fruits (such as sweet orange pomelo) and vegetables (such as Zizania latifolia ) are the main sources of carbohydrates and vitamins in the diet, and also contain various organic acids, aromat ic substances and pigment components, conducive to mediating people's taste; oil plants (such as camellia oil), rich in unsaturated fatty acids, can prevent arteriosclerosis, and promote the body's absorption of fat -soluble fibers and such trace elements a s calcium, iron, and zinc; cereals (such as Chenopodium quinoa ) are rich in dietary fiber, facilitating intestinal peristalsis, and GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 26 improving cardiovascular function; aquatic products (such as field carp) provide rich and complete protein for residents, an d are a good source of some vitamins and minerals. Therefore, this heritage system provides a strong guarantee for the food security of local residents in terms of both food quantity and nutritional structure. Figure 9 Relationship between the supply of agricultural products and the well -balanced dietary pyramid. Mushrooms, nuts, fruits, oil plants, cereals, potatoes, vegetables and aquatic products, etc. in the site can provide a full and balanced diet for local people . 1.2 Livelihood Maintenance with Different Industry Types (1) Rich and diverse industry types Relying on rich forest resources, the site has formed a variety of industries including agricultural production, processing and sales, as well as forest and rural cultural tourism. Among others, the agricultural industry is mainly composed of the forestry and fruit growing industry (including forest tree, fruit tree cultivation, etc.), mushroom cultivation industry, grain and vegetable planting industry; the aquaculture, animal husbandry and other commercial crop cultivation industries are relatively small in production scale. Starting from the agricultural production, other industries such as agricultural product processing, marketing, and rural tourism have gradually developed. Qingyuan County has established relatively complete industry chains of forestry and fruit growing and mushroom cultivation (Figure 10), which is of great leading effect to the industry development of the site. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 27 Figure 10 Industry chain of forestry and fruit growing, mushroom cultivation, and their interrelations in Qingyuan County. According to the statistics, the total output value of the site was 82.83 million RMB Yuan in 201 9 (Table 3), accounting for 45.4%, 24.0%, and 30.6% of the primary, secondary and tertiary industries, respectively (Figure 11), which was a balanced distribution in industrial structure. Among others, the output values of forestry and fruit growing, mushroom cultivation, and grain and vegetable planting account for 15.1%, 24.2% and 4.0% respectively, with a total proportion of 43.3%.

Forestry and fruit growing industries. In 201 9, the cultivated area of timber and economic forests in the site reached 12,300 mu, accounting for 7.5% of Qingyuan County, with a gross output value of 9.178 million RMB Yuan . Most timber woods have been roughly or finely processed into wood products like bamboo chopsticks, pencils, wooden doors, and furniture (Figure 12), and some broad -leaved timber have been processed into raw materials for mushroom cultivation. Besides, agricultural products such as Castanea henryi , bamboo shoots, and sweet orange pome los, are exquisite gifts for people to give to relatives and friends after processing. The output value of processing of forestry and fruit growing industry therein reached 6.328 million RMB Yuan in 201 9. What's more, the beautiful forest landscape and eco logical environment have also attracted many tourists to come for sightseeing. In 201 9, the natural forest scenic spot in the site received 35,600 tourists, generating 8.942 million RMB Yuan in revenue, accounting for 35.2% of the output value of the terti ary industries. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 29 Figure 12 Major processed products of forestry and fruit growing industry Mushroom cultivation industries. In 201 9, the yield of mushroom in the site reached 11.032 million bags, accounting for 9.6% of Qingyuan County, with a total output value of 20.05 million RMB Yuan . A variety of intensively processed products, dominated by dried products of Xianggu and Grifola frondosa , snack food, seasonings and herbal medicines, have been developed in the site (Figure 13), in order to give full play to the edible and medicinal value of various mushrooms. In 201 9, there were 3 enterprises processing mushroom in the site, with an output value of 7.844 million RMB Bamboo chopsticks Pencils Wooden doors Furniture Sticks for mushroom cultivation Dried bamboo shoots Castanea henryi Sweet orange pomelos GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 30 Yuan . Since being listed in China Nationally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems in China (China -NIAHS) in 2014, the site has witnessed a great leap in rural cultural tourism. I n 201 9, cultural attractions related to mushroom cultivation received 84,600 visitors, achieving a tourism revenue of 11.065 million RMB Yuan , accounting for about 43.7% of the output value of the tertiary industries therein. Figure 13 Main processed products of mushroom cultivation industry Lentinula edodes System in Zhejiang Province 31 In 2002,\"Qingyuan Mushroom\" was awarded as a geographical indication product by the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of the PRC. In 2003, it was approved to be registered as a certification trademark . In 2013, it was aw arded as a well -known trademark in China. In 2020, it has passed the certification of agricultural products geographical indication by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the PRC, and has been selected into the first batch of protection list o f geographical indications in China and Europe. As the most distinctive mushroom products in the heritage site, i n addition to using the \"Qingyuan Mushroom\" public brand (Figure 14), the mushrooms produced by Duohua cultivation will also be marked with the words \"Produced by Duohua Cultivation\" in a prominent position. Figure 14 The agricultural product geographical indications registration certificate of Qingyuan mushroom Grain and vegetable planting industries. The grain and vegetable planting in the site is dominated by the production of grains, potatoes, beans, vegetables, etc. Most of these products are consumed, marketed, or used in agritainment business without processing, and few of them are put to reproce ss. Compared with the forestry and fruit growing industry and the mushroom cultivation industry, the output value of the grain and vegetable planting -based secondary and tertiary industries is relatively low. In 201 9, the output value focused on food suppl y of grains and vegetables and packaging and processing of herbal medicines was up to 1.356 million RMB Yuan . GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 32 In all, various industries supported by this heritage system have formed a closely linked industrial system, dominating the economic development o f the site. According to the statistics, the total output value of the forestry and fruit growing, mushroom cultivation, and grain and vegetable planting industries reached 27.932 million RMB Yuan , 39.807 million RMB Yuan , and 5.036 million RMB Yuan respec tively, totaling 72.775 million RMB Yuan , accounting for 87.9% of the site' GDP. (2) Employment and economic income of local farmers In 201 9, the population of the site was 5,022 with a total of 2,173 households, and the number of employees was 2,973 (Tabl e 4), accounting for 59.2% of the total population. With the acceleration of urbanization and the expansion in employment channel for migrant workers, the industrial system of this heritage system still functions to guarantee the most basic employment for local residents, and the residents involved in the system account for nearly 41.4% of the labor force under employment, with the middle -aged and old laborers at an even higher proportion. Table 4 Employment of the labor force in the site in 201 9 Note: The township statistics in the table is only about the administrative villages located within the site. The permanent laborers in the site take quite a variety of occupations, and the forestry and fruit growing, mushroom cultivation, grain and vegetable planting industries, together with directly related processing and service businesses such as marketing an d tourism, are the major channels for local employment. The survey shows that there are 877 laborers engaged in the production activity associated with the above major industries; there are 355 laborers involved in the processing, sales of agricultural products and raw materials, and rural tourism associated with the above major industries. The total number of two parts is 1,232, accounting for 88.1% of the total permanent labor force in the site (Figure 15).

Among others, the total number of permanent laborers engaged in the the forestry and fruit growing, mushroom cultivation, grain and vegetable planting industries, together with directly related processing and service businesses, account for 88.1% of the total permanent labor force in the s ite. There are three mushroom cultivation methods: Duohua cultivation, wood log cultivation and substitute material cultivation. Meanwhile, there are 63, 70 and 494 labors engag ing in the three mushroom cultivation methods , with economic output value of 318,000 RMB Yuan, 261,000 RMB Yuan and 9,942,000 RMB Yuan respectively. Because of labor shortage and forest conservation, substitute material cultivation technique is widely adopted by most farmers. However, the mushroom produced by traditional Duohua method has much higher price due to its unique flavor, making some farmers still adopt traditional Duohua method to cultivate mushrooms (Table 5). Correspondingly, the forestry and fruit growing, mushroom cultivation, grain and vegetable planting industries, and directly related processing and service businesses are important income sources for local residents. In 2019, the rural per capita net income was 17,399.8 RMB Yuan in the site. Among others, the income from the forestry and fruit growing, mushroom cultivation, grain and vegetable planting industries as well as corresponding processing and service businesses were 3,091.4 RMB Yuan, 4,340.5 RMB Yuan and 1 ,680.4 RMB Yuan respectively (Table 6), accounting for about 17.8%, 24.9% and 9.7% of the rural per capita net income respectively (Figure 16). The total proportion of 52.4% was a litter more than that as migrant workers of 41.6%. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 34 Table 5 Production of thr ee cultivation methods of mushroom in 201 9 Note: The output of mushroom s in the table is dry mushroom s; some farmers use two or three cultivation methods to produce mushroom s in the site. Table 6 Rural per capita net income and main sources in 201 9 Note: The township statistics in the table is only about the administrative villages located within the site. Based on above statistics, it can be seen that the proportion of the labor force (41.4%) engaged in the production, processing and related services of the forestry and fruit growing, mushroom cultivation and grain and vegetable planting industries is lower than that of the labor force (52.9%) engaged in out -migrating for work, but the proportion of its per capita income (52.4%) is higher than that of the per capita income (41.6%) of out -migrati ng for work. The results showed that the average labor productivity of above industries was higher than that of out -migrating for work. It can be expected that with the protection and development of QFMCS, the above related industries can attract more migr ant workers to return home for employment, thus promoting the sustainable development of agriculture and rural areas in the site.

Animals under first class state protection (10 species) -culture System in Zhejiang Province 49 List of animals under special state -culture System in Zhejiang Province 50 Figure 25 Animals under first class state protection in the site Tragopan System in Zhejiang Province 51 2.5 Biodiversity Values QFMCS is a typical mountainous agroforestry production system. The various elements cooperate with each other to play the functions of raw material supply, species conservation, water and soil maintenance, climate regulation, nutrient cycling, landscape aesthetics and other services . (1) Supplying raw materi als. Forests provide abundant wood resources for the mushroom industry. On the one hand, people fell mushroom trees to cultivate Xianggu by Duohua method in the forests or wood log method on a gentle slope. On the other hand, people turn woods into culture materials to cultivate mushrooms by substitute material method. Terraces ensure the food supply for local residents and maintain the biodiversity of the farmland; at the same time, the crop straw is also the culture materials for the mushroom cultivation. (2) Conserving species. The site has rich forest resources and it is a natural gene bank for species (Figure 26). There are 326 species of bryophytes and 2241 species of vascular plants; animal resources include 2203 species of insects and 254 species of vertebrates. The site is also a natural refuge for rare and endangered species. There have 94 species (27 specie s of plants and 67 species of animals) under national key protection, which have important values for scientific research and popular science. The 3 Abies beshanzuensis preserved through quaternary glaciers, known as the \"plant giant panda\" and listed as o ne of the 12 most endangered plants in the world by the International Species Protection Committee in 1987 , is an ancient relic species unique to Baishanzu Mountain, which is a \"living fossil\" for the study of the occurrence and changes of paleogeography a nd climate . The site is also a locality of biological model specimens. So far, 286 species of new biological specimens were collected from Baishanzu area, including 36 species of plant and 250 species of insect. (3) Conserving water and soil. The function of water and soil conservation offered by forests, especially in the source of rivers and areas where geological hazards are prone, has made important contributions to disaster prevention and mitigation in the site. The climate of this place is warm and humid, and annual precipitation is high. Rich forest resources have played a positive role in water and soil conservation. Closed canopy can intercept a considerable amount of precipitation, reduce the intensity of rainstorm and prolong the rai nfall time. Preservation of weeds and branches under the forest also cushions the impact of rainwater. In addition, forest plays a good role in water storage and purifying water quality by intercepting, absorbing and accumulating precipitation through its huge canopy, undergrowth shrub layer, thick litter, forest soil layer and developed root system. These measures have weakened the intensity of soil erosion and played the role of water and soil conservation. It is estimated that every GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 52 square kilometer of f orests can reduce soil loss by 7500 t/a, conserve water by 4.2\u00d7 104 m3/a, and reduce soil fertility by 600 t/a compared with non -forest land. Figure 26 There have rich forest resources in the site. It is a natural gene bank for species and also a locality of biological model specimens. (4) Adjusting climate and purifying environment. Because of the high ecosystem services of Q FMCS , the site has pleasant climates, with no severe cold in winter, no heat in s ummer. The shading effect of forest crown and the transpiration effect of forest growth can regulate the temperature, humidity, evaporation, transpiration and rainfall of the region. Forest absorbs carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, fixes carbon in the atmosphere, produces organic matter and releases oxygen at the same time, which is also an important mechanism of atmospheric balance of the earth system. Forests also plays an important role in improving negative oxygen ions in the air. The annual average of negative oxygen ions in Baishanzu scenic spot is 7623/cm3, which is much higher than the average number of 2100/cm3 in other counties. Forests also have the function of environment purification, such as noise reduction , bacteria el imination, pollutant and dust absorption. Preliminary estimates show that each square kilometer of forests can fix about 3050 t/a of CO 2, equivalent to 830 t/a of pure carbon, and release about 2250 t/a of oxygen; each square kilometer of forests can absor b about 9 t/a of SO 2, purify 600 kg/a of nitrogen oxides and retain 1000 t/a of dust. (5) Promoting nutrient cycling. Nutrient cycling is the basis for the survival and development of organisms in forest ecosystem. In the QFMCS, forests provide habitat GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 53 and nutrients for fungi, and fungi promote the nutrient cycling of the forests. Studies have shown that mycorrhizal fungi can form mycorrhizal symbiosis with more than 80% of tree species in the forests, which can improve the host's ability to absorb soil nu trients and affect the growth of forest plants. That is to say, mycorrhizal fungi plays an important role in the cycle process of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) of forest ecosystem. In addition, the mushroom dreg of substitute material cultivatio n can be made into feed for raising livestock or made into mushroom dreg fertilizer. The excrements of poultry and livestock as well as the mushroom dreg fertilizer can return to the farmlands to provide nutrients for the crops. (6) Providing landscape and aesthetics value. The site has beautiful mountains and rivers, and rich natural landscapes, including Baishanzu natural reserve, Jinzifeng forest park, alpine wetlands, alpine meadows and others. The average annual temperature of Baishanzu natural reserve is 12. 8 and suitable for tourist . Because the mountains are high and fog, the sea of clouds has become a major landscape of Baishanzu natural reserve . In Jinzifeng forest park, there have a large number of pond, shallow, spring and waterfalls with differ ent appearance. Meanwhile, there also have a lot of ancient villages, ancient bridges, ancient roads, ancient buildings, etc. in the site. 3 Local and Traditional Knowledge Systems 3.1 Natural Forest Conservation Techniques The technical measures of natural forest conservation in the site mainly include closing hillsides to facilitate aff orestation , intermediate cutting and stand improvement . Based on the principle of forest conservation , people carry out forest management activities and harvest vario us forest products at the same time. Closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation technique : For fengshui forests around the villages or inaccessible areas in the site, the mountain area will be completely closed and all production activities are prohibited. Other forest land with a certain amount of well-grown trees species and high forest cover age rate will apply t he semi -closed method . The mountains are closed and access is not allowed usually except in the particular season. At that time, people are able to go to the mountains for certain production activities in the premise of no damage to the forest, e.g . firewood cutting, grass cutting, mushroom and wild fruits picking. Intermediate cutting technique: In order to foster suitable trees for mushroom cultivation, the thinning is exercised according to the stand density in forest management, and the tending of related tree species is carried out to meet the cultivation requirements of mushroom forest. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 54 Stand improvement technique : For forests with few trees and serious pests and disease, the original trees are cut and the target species are planted under the c rown canopy to form high -value broad -leaved forest s or coniferous and broad -leaved mixed forests based on the canopy density of the stand, the area of the open space in the forest s and the quantity and distribution status of the target tree species. 3.2 Mushroom Forest Management Techniques Mushroom forest management techniques formed in the process of mushroom cultivation are coordinated development techniques of forest resource conservation and mushroom cultivation, including mushroom forest selection, mushroom tree selective cutting, mushroom forest management, mushroom tree planting and so on . Mushroom forest selection technique : Firstly, Gumin select forests with fertile soil and appropriate temperature and humidity for the growth of broad -leaved trees, which can guarantee the harvest of mushrooms and the rapid renewal of tree species suitable for mushroom cultivation . Second ly, they select forests with proper tree species. In high altitude area, tree species such as Castanopsis carlessi , Castanopsis hystrix , Santalum album and Liquidambar formosana are selected. In low altitude area, tree species such as Elaeocarpus selected . Because of the multiple choices for mushroom trees, Gumin are able to avoid the excessive cutting of single tree species. Mushroom tree s elect ive cutting technique : Gumin manage the mushroom forest s by means of select ive cutting. Considering the shade of crown closure of mushroom trees and the rotation of the mountain forests , the trees with the diameter at breast height of less than 12 cm are not allowed to cut by principle. The actual amount of timber cutting is controlled to below 15% of the total wood volume per unit area of the forest s. Under such circumstance, the forest vegetation will not be destroyed and the upgrading of the forest s is promoted objectively, which comply with the current code of forest harvesting (Figure 27). Mushroom forest management technique: Gumin often climb on the tree s and cut the large branches and then fell the tree s to reduce the damage to the plants under the forest s. When mushroom trees were felled, it would not be moved to avoid the damage to other plants and the shade trees would be reserved to control the forest canopy density . Because of above methods, a suitable forest environment for the growth of renewal tree species and mushrooms was create d. Meanwhil e, the washing effect of rainwater to the forest ecosystem is reduced and the rainfall interception of stand is enhanced. Furthermore, the trunks, branches and leaves of mushroom trees are left in the forests, which can increase the soil humus and promote the soil and water conservation. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 55 Mushroom tree planting technique Gumin always plant mushroom trees on barren mountains, open forest land or cutover land to develop the mushroom forest resources. The seedlings of mushroom trees us ed to plant are usually dug directly from mushroom forests with soil , and then transplanted to the growth site by Gumin in spring. Before transplanting, 1/3 of branches are cut off properly. Figure 27 Trees with the diameter at breast height of less than 12 cm are not allowed to cut by principle. The actual amount of timber cutting is controlled to below 15% of the total wood volume per unit area of the forests. 3.3 Forest Utilization Techniques In add ition to cutting mushroom trees to cultivate mushrooms, Gumin also use other trees widely. The woods of Pines , Cinnamomum camphora and Phoebe zhennan are used to build houses or process into pots, buckets and other living utensils; miscellaneous trees are used to make charcoal for life heating; the barks of Cinnamomum subavenium are peeled to make cooking spices; the leaves or fruits of plants such as Dendropanax dentigerus , Eurya japonica and Choerospondias axillaris are picked to make all kinds of foods; bamboo woods are used to make daily necessities such as bamboo strips and weave, etc. (Figure 28). GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 56 Pine sink Cinnamon Dendropanax dentigerus Huangguo Fruit of Choerospondias axillaris Jujube cake Bamboo baskets Bamboo fire cages Figure 28 In addition to cutting mushroom trees to cultivate mushrooms, Gumin also use other trees widely to make daily necessities or all kinds of foods. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 57 Pine s spp. utilization: Besides building Gumin' s shack s, pine wood is often used to bake mushrooms . Because pine wood contains natural oil and has a unique rosin flavor, mushrooms baked with it has a strong unique fragrance. In addition, Gumin use pine as a water tank to store water in mountain forests. Because pine responds quickly to the temperature, it is easy to swell, but it is extremely difficult to air -dry naturally, the water tank made of pine wood is durable and not easy to crack. Cinn amomum subavenium utilization: Gumin often peel the barks of Cinnamomum subavenium with the age more than 10 years and its phloem forming oil layer to make spices. When baking mushroom , Gumin usually put the bark on the wooden shelf to make it been dried a nd then store it. The bark is called cinnamon after drying. Dendropanax dentigerus utilization: In April and May, Gumin always eat the tender leaves of Dendropanax dentigerus . Tender leaves can be pick ed throughout the growth period and pickled before storage and used for cooking, soup, stuffing, dipping sauce and cold vegetable dish in sauce or served with noodles with enjoyable flavor. Eurya japonica utilization: Gumin usually take the juice of Eurya japonica leaves mixed with japonica rice and then steam them in a can. After that, the rice is poured into the mortar, hit with a hammer, until it is all fused like a cotton ball. Gumin cut it into small pieces, knead and press it into a round strip while hot, and then store for several mon ths. As well as, some Gumin burn branches or leaves of Eurya japonica to ash, drain the plant alkali, and soak japonica rice with them to make Huangguo . Choerospondias axillaris utilization: The fruits of Choerospondias axillaris are usually eaten directly by Gumin or washed to make wine . Sometimes, the fruits are peeled skin and removed kernel, added some sucrose to be condense by boiling with soft fire, and then made into wild jujube cake after natural withering . Bamboo utilization: Gumin often use bamboo slices to make various agricultural tools. The most common ones are bamboo baskets for mushroom picking and drying, bamboo fire cages for daily heating. Since the bamboo slices is easily made and woven , they are seen in the site commonly . There are also complex processes to utilize bamboo to make furniture. Bamboo chair is the common furniture here, which is made after bamboo cutting, drying, hole-digging, scraping and joint fixation. 3.4 Utilization Techniques of Resources under the Forest s The utilization of resources under the forests includes picking and eating wild fungi, as well as using the herbs , thus forming a special wild fung us identification methods and traditional medic al knowledge in the site. (1) Wild fung us identification methods There are rich wild fung us resources i n the forests . For non -toxic wild fungi, it is GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 58 needed to be boiled with fresh water and then cooked to avoid the intoxication when fresh -eating , or it can be dried and stored for use later . The medicinal wild fungi are usually dried and then used for wine or soup (Table 15). Table 1 5 Common Wild Fung us Identification Methods (2) Traditional medical knowledge When Gumin get injured or sick in mountains , they are often treated with herbs from nearby forests, except for some valuable medicinal materials which are prepared by themselves and brought to shacks for reserve, thus a unique set of \" Gush an Medical First-aid Method\" has gradually been formed. The medicinal materials mainly come from the common herbaceous plant in forests. In addition, Gumin are easy to be bitten by poisonous snakes or insects when they go out, so they gradually form herbal remedies to treat pains caused by bites in mountains (Figure 29). Identification elements Toxic wild fung us Non-toxic wild fung us Growing zone The fungus u sually grow s in wet, dark and dirty zone. The fungus u sually grow s on the clean pasture , or on the pine trees, oak trees and other withered tree stumps. Color Bright in color s, including golden, pink, white, green, inkiness, cyanosis, purple (highly toxic), etc. Color will change after picking. Natural color, mostly brown, pale purple or red without other mixed colors. Shape Weird shape, surface thick and stiff, ring on the fung us stem, fungus rod slender or thick and easy to break . Surface flat and smooth without rings and no collarium on the lower part. Secretion Dense and brown, color of broken fungus surface easy to fade in the air. Clear (white for some), no color fading for the broken part of the fungi surface. Odor Weird odor, smelling like potato or radish, often spicy, sour and stench. Special fragrance, smelling like amaretto or fruits. Other The fungus does not attract birds, insects, mice and other animals, which means it is not edible. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 59 Figure 29 When Gumin get injured or sick in mountains, or were bitten by poisonous snakes or insects , the medicinal materials mainly come from the common herbaceous plant in forests. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 60 Figure 30 Evolution of mushroom cultivation techniques. Though wood log and substitute m aterial method s based on artific ial inoculation have improved the production efficiency greatly , they share the similar cultivation principle with Duohua method . GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 61 3.5 Mushroom Cultivation T echnique s The mushroom cultivation techniques in the site has successively experienced three development stages , there are Duohua , wood log, and substitute m aterial method s. Though wood log and substitute m aterial method s based on artificial inoculation have improved the production efficiency greatly , they share the similar cultivation principle with Duohua method . Ever to this day, Duohua method still play an important reference value for modern mushroom cultivation (Figure 30). (1) Duohua cultivation technique Duohua cultivation technique is a comprehensive technical measure, which can be divided into eight successive processes, including site selection, cutting down tree, Duohua , shielding, Changhua , shielding -removal, Jingxun (hitting mushroom tree), picking and bak ing (Figure 31). Site selection : Site selection is to find a suitable forest for mushroom cultivation (Same as the mushroom forest selection technique). Duohua method relies on natural spore inoculation, and the cultivation process is completed in the forest, so the site selection is particularly important. Cutting down tree: Gumin call mushroom tree as \"Qiang \". From solstice (late December) to early spring (early February), at the latest before Tomb Sweeping Day (early April), Gumin cut down mushroom trees with predetermined orientation according to the topography, eliminate excess branches, leave a small numb er of branches and tail branches, and then use them to cultivate Xianggu . Duohua : Duohua is to cut different depth and sloping slits by axe based on the specie, size, age of mushroom tree, and then natural spores fall in the scares and form mycelium to yie ld Xianggu , which is a key of cultivating Xianggu . Shielding : After Duohua , mushroom trees should be covered with a certain number of branches, leaves and other things to prevent the sun from exposure. This link is called \"Shielding\". Shielding can avoid excessive drying of mushroom trees , thus maintaining relatively stable humidity. Shielding should be evenly covered with moderate thickness, to shield sunlight, keep ventilation, maintain moisture, and let it germinate. Changhua : After a year, if the micro environment is suitable, the mycelium will grow and develop faster, and a small amount of Xianggu grows on the mushroom trees , which is called \" Changhua \". But this kind of Xianggu is small and thin, Gumin intend to keep it, so th at its spores and mycelia can extend to other mushroom trees nearby. Shielding -removal : Two years later, at the beginning of winter or slight snow, mushroom trees began to produce Xianggu . The covering branches and leaves would be removed, so that the mush room trees can increase oxygen content and stimulation of natural temperature difference to the mycelium, and then grow more fruiting bodies. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 62 This link is called \"shielding -removal\". The harvest amount in this year accounted for 1/3 to 1/4 of the total yie ld in the whole cycle according to different tree species. Site selection Cutting down tree Duohua Shielding Changhua Shielding -removal Jingxun (hitting mushroom tree) Picking and baking Figure 31 Duohua cultivation technique can be divided into eight successive processes, including site selection, cutting down tree, Duohua , shielding, Changhua , shielding -removal, Jingxun (hitting mushroom tree), picking and baking. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 63 Jingxun : When some mushroom trees have better mycelium yet fai l to produce Xianggu or the nutrition of them decrease in later period, farmers often use mallet to hit them , so that the mycelium in the mushroom trees is broken, and the oxygen demand of the mycelium is adjusted and improved , which can promote the formation of fruiting bodies and achieve the purpose of Xianggu production. This link is called \" Jingxun \". After hitting, it usually becomes effective in 7 to 8 days. If it still doesn't work, the next hitting will be ineffective. Picking and baking : The key point of picking Xianggu is to be adept in watching the weather and pick at the right time. The key point of baking Xianggu is to control the time of duration and the temperature of heating, and checking carefully. This is also an important skill related to the quality of dry Xianggu . Because Duohua method must be finished in forests, Gumin generally spend four to five months in mountains during the production period, namely from the beginning of December to the end of April of the next year (Figure 32). Figure 32 Production rhythm of Duohua method (2) Wood log cultivation technique The invention of strain inoculation techn ique has promoted the mushroom cultivation technique to covert from relying on natural spore inoculation (that is Duohua method ) to artificial strain inoculation. The initial artificial inoculation mushroom cultivation in the site was carried out on the wood log. Wood log cultivation refers to cut ting the trunk into logs with the length of 1 m or 1.2 m, and then intensive mushroom cultivation are carried out on the l ogs. By changing the humidity, light, air, etc. of the mushroom cultivation site, the production efficiency of wood logs will be improved. The wood log cultivation technique consists of six processes (Figure 33). GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 64 Figure 33 Wood log cultivation refers to cut ting the trunk into logs with the length of 1 m or 1.2 m to cultivate mushroom s by artificial strain inoculation. Site selection : The site should be flat dryland or hillside fields with an altitude of 400-800 m, part-gravel soil , natural shadow, and close to the water source. Wood log preparation : The trees suitable for Duohua cultivation are also applicable for wood log cultivation . Gumin cut down t he selected trees , removed the branches , cut the trunk into logs , and then deliver to the site for drying slowly . Inoculation management : Before inoculation, wood logs should be sterilized to avoid the microbial contamination. The inoculation by punch is applied for the strains. After the strains are put into the hole, they should be sealed with paraffin or bark. Mycelial growth management : Wood logs should be cover ed proper ly after being stacke d in order to avoid the direct sunshine. The thick wood logs should be placed outside and the thin ones inside. The place and stacking way should be beneficial to ventilation, but wood logs cannot be placed in the draught. The stacking methods should Site selection Wood log preparation Inoculation management Mycelial growth management Growth stimulation Mushroom output management GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 65 vary in accordance with seasons, terrain and temperature. Special attention should be paid to the temperature and ventilation, to avoid the moisture . Growth stimulation: The stimulating methods of accelerating the fruiting body formation of mushrooms include soaking by water or sprinkling water, tapping log and stimulation by temperature difference. Mushroom output management : According to the growth season of fruiting body , mushrooms can be divided into autumn mushrooms , winter mushroom s and spring mushrooms, and the management focus for different mushrooms is different. Generally, Gumin pick mushrooms on a sunny day, and harvest them in time when the fruiting body grows to six or seven mature . In case of a large number of mushroom s need to be picked, the mature and high -quality mushrooms are picked firstly . After picking, wood logs should be piled in the cross form with the height of 1.5 m and the spacing of above 10 cm, which is conducive to the next mushroom output. (3) Substitute material cultivat ion technique Substitute material cultivation is to use waste such as sawdust, bagasse, cotton seed hull and crop straws as main raw materials, combin ing with proper amount of wheat bran and rice bran , to make culture materials for mushroom cultivation, wh ich can replace the traditional cultivation with woods as the main materials . It generally includes five main steps (Figure 34). Mushroom shed construction : Mushroom shed should be built on dry wasteland, open land or rice fields with convenient transportation and abundant water resources. Local people often use China fir tail or small fir as the main skeleton, bamboo and bamboo tail as the upper -frame and fern s as the cover on the top. Mushroom stick production and sterilization : Culture materials of substitute material cultivation are mainly composed of sawdust , bran, brown sugar and plaster according to a certain proportion. T he sawdust is made of high -qualit y broad -leaved trees and the bran is byproduct of flour processing. When mixing and packaging to make mushroom stick, t he plastic bag should be sealed tightly and the culture materials on the bag mouth should be cleaned . It is needed to be treated gently and check whether the bag is intact. After that, the bacteria in the mushroom sticks should be killed by high temperature . Inoculation by punch : The inoculation will begin when the temperature of the mushroom stick drops to the point of not feeling hot. The time for inoculation should be as soon as possible in order to reduce the exposure time of culture materials, thus the invasion opportunity of other bacteria will reduce greatly . Cultivation management : During this process, special attention shou ld be paid to temperature and humidity control of shed , as well as ventilation of sticks . GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 66 Mushroom output management : After a long term of cultivation, fruiting bod ies will come up after remov ing the plastic bags. Mushroom output management is to grasp the moisture content of the mushroom stick s, temperature, humidity and light of the shed, and coordinate the relationship between them . Figure 34 Substitute material cultivation is to use sawdust and crop straws , etc. as main raw materials to cultivate mushroom s by artificial strain inoculation. In Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province, the three methods of Duohua cultivation, wood log cultivation and substitute material cultivation complement each other. Their technical principles are derived from the same origin and develop iteratively, implementing the development concept of human -land harmony and forest -mushroom co -culture, and realizing the systematic circulation and sustainable development of forest conservation and mushroom cultivation. Also, the three methods have certain competition relationship through the comparison of market Mushroom shed construction Mushroom stick production Sterilization Inoculation by punch Cultivation management Mushroom output management GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 67 benefits, but they have different positioning to meet the market demand of different levels. Because the earliest invented method of Duohua cultivation is a near -natural method, the mushroom s produced by this method have better quality and taste. This method has been inherited and used among local Gumin , but the yield of mushrooms produced by this method is relatively low. At present it is used only by Gumin or as a high-end product in the ma rket circulation. Wood log cultivation is a semi -natural method, and the mushrooms produced by this method have higher yield and belong to the middle -end products. Substitute material cultivation is a production method of artificial nature, and the mushroo ms produced by this method are characterized by high yield and common taste, which belong to the popular products. Substitute material cultivation, like Duohua cultivation, realizes the circulation and balance of the agroforestry system. Firstly, it has l ower raw material standard with more available tree species to be chosen and without limit on their size, which can be branches, dead wood and straw. Secondly, it has higher yield. Compared with Duohua cultivation which relies on natural spore inoculation, substitute material cultivation is changed into artificial inoculation, greatly improving the production efficiency, so that more mushrooms can be obtained from the same amount of wood. Thirdly, it can be used for a wide range of purposes. Unlike Duohua cultivation in which the mushroom woods rot on the spot and are returned to the forest, as for substitute material cultivation, after the mushrooms grow on the mushroom sticks, the residues can not only be processed into organic fertilizer for returning to the field and forest, but also can be used as feed and firewood, which can be recycled in multiple ways. 3.6 Forest -Mushroom Co -culture Techniques (1) Forest -mushroom co -culture techniques of Duohua method Forest -mushroom -forest pattern : There have abundant vegetation types in the site. Different vegetation types are suitable for the growth of different mushrooms . Gumin often pick Poria cocos and , and pick Ressula spp. under the broad -leaved forest s. In this process , the forest s provide growth environment and nutrients for mushrooms, and the n mushrooms can accelerate the decomposition of organic matters, dead wood s and litter to increase the nutri ents of the forest s. Meanwhile, Gumin use Duohua method to cultivate mushro oms, but the trunks , branches, leaves and roots of the mushroom trees were left in forest s for decomposition and rot. This method not only increases the soil humus and provides nutrients for the regrowth of trees, but also is beneficial to maintain the water and soil conservation functions of the forests (Figure 35). GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 68 Figure 35 In the forest -mushroom -forest pattern, forests provide a growing environment and nutrients for edible fungi; edible fungi accelerate the decomposition of organic matter i n the forests, which increases the nutrients in the forests. (2) Forest -mushroom co -culture techniques I of modern cultivation method Forest -mushroom -farmland pattern : In addition to cultivating mushrooms by forests, the litter of forests is also a good fertilizer for agriculture. Gumin do not have the custom of storing plant ash . In case of in need of fertilizer, they will carry the litter down the mountain s, burn it into ash and then scatter it on the farmland, which can prevent the plant diseases and insect pests and enhance the soil fertili ty. When planting rice, the ash is directly scattered in the paddy field. When planting dry crops, the seed is sown and covered with ash before covering the soil. As for the straws of the rice, corn and vegetables on the farmland s, they will remain on farm lands by mulching treatment and then be chopped and buried in the soil to increase the soil organic matters when plough ing. After the introduction of artificial strain production technique, some of the crop straws can be chopped and mixed with sawdust, bagasse, wild grass and other matters to form culture materials for mushroom cultivat ion. After cultivation, some of the mushroom s ticks can be recycled, and those that cannot be recycled can be returned to the farmlands as fertilizers (Figure 36). (3) Forest -mushroom co -culture techniques II of modern cultivation method Mushroom forest -mushroom -livestock breeding -farmland (economic forests) pattern : When farmers fell mushroom trees and use wood log or substitute m aterial method to cultivate mushrooms, the residues of wood log cultivation are often returned to the farmland or used as firewood to bake mushroom . As for the residues of substitute material cultivation , some of them is recycled for mushroom cultivation, some of them for livestock breeding or organic fertilizers , and the rest for firewood. Meanwhile, Gumin will store the excrements of men, pigs, chicken, ducks and sheep, and then apply them as fertilizers of farmland or orchard to increase the soil nutrients . Crop straws will be used as the culture materials for mushroom cultivat ion (Figure 37). GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 69 Figure 36 In the f orest -mushroom -farmland pattern, f orest litters are burned and spread on farmland. Crop straw can be mulched to increase soil fertility, or mixed into culture materials for mushroom cultivation. Figure 37 In the mushroom forest -mushroom -livestock breeding -farmland pattern, woods and crop straws use as raw materials for mushroom cultivation. The remaining culture material can be used for mushroom cultivation again, or used as organic fertilizer, or burned to bake mushroom, or used as livestock feed to feed livestock. The excrements of livestock and poultry are collected and applied to farmland to increase soil nutrients. The rich and diverse resource recycling modes formed by wood log cultivation and substitute material cultivation have realized the agroforestry use and sustainable forest management. Firstly, Gumin recycle the residues of mushroom cultivation. Residues of wood log cultivation are usually returned to fields and forests as organic fertilizers or used as firewood instead of wood. Part of the residues of the substitute material cultivation are recyclable and again used for the cultivation of mushroom, and the rest are used as livestock and poultry feed or organic fertilizer. The packaging bags of mushroom stick are also recycled to be made into plastic par ticles for secondary processing and utilization, so that the recycling of the bags are realized. Secondly, the diversity of mushroom tree species in the heritage site has been preserved. There are dozens of tree species in the mushroom forest, which are ve ry rich. Gumin will fully GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 70 consider the type and scale of mushroom tree species when cutting, so as to avoid excessive cutting of single tree species. 4 Culture, Value System and Social Organization 4.1 Forest Ecological Culture (1) Ecological view of forest and mushroom co -culture The ecological view of forest and mushroom co -culture guarantees the stability and sustainable development of the heritage system. Firstly, local people develop mushroom industry to make a living with forest resources and retain the original ecological environment of the forest to ensure its sustainable utilization and the sustainability of its function. Local people choose to cultivate mushrooms in the forests and formed a traditional forest conservation and mushroom cultivation skill, is not only the ability to make a living which considers the adaption to the forest environment, but also a core technique of understanding, adapting to and utilizing nature. What's more, it ensures the harmonious unity of forest ecology, agricultural ecology and human settlement environment. Secondly, Gumin' s workplace embodies the simple nature view of Chinese traditional culture, which is \"taking from nature and returning to nature\". Gumin's shack s for housing themselves and baking Xianggu and mushroom sheds for mushroom cultivation were built based on local materials, minimizing the use of modern materials such as steel rods and cement. After discarding, these materials will decay and degrade on their own, then return to nature, thus becom ing a nutrient for the growth of trees. Thirdly, during the process of cutting trees, Gumin strictly adhere to the principles of \"cutting old trees while keeping new trees, cutting dense forests while leaving thinning forests, cutting at certain intervals, and rotating the mushroom forests\", which reflects the superb ecological wisdom of harmony between human beings and nature. (2) Worshipping Shanshen - a custom to protect forests Shanshen means the god of mountain. The custom of worshipping Shanshen is a unique folk activity in the site, which shows the Gumin 's reverence and gratitude for mountains. Villagers live in the mountains for generations, on which all their basic necessities depend. Shanshen governs everything there, so local residents place great reverence as well as much hope and desire on him. This taboo, characterized by primitive belief, is beneficial to protect the forest resources (Figure 38). (3) Acknowledging Shuniang - a custom of revering and getting close to trees Acknowledging Shuniang means to take a tree as a mother. This custom has been prevailing up to now in the site, which is why many villages have a lot of century -old GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 71 trees. Gumin take mushroom cultivation as their principal works and treat trees with deep affection. They hope for trees' protection on children. In the thought of the villagers, old trees are antiquated and merciful and can keep children away from sickness and disasters, which help them to grow up healthily (Figure 39). Figure 38 Worshipping Shanshen in the site. Shanshen , the god of mountain, governs everything there. Figure 39 Acknowledging Shuniang means to take a tree as a mother. Villagers thought old trees can help children to grow up healthily. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 72 (4) Sacrificing Fengshui forest - a custom for overall forest protection Fengshui is a traditional ecological thought in China . Fengshui forest is the location where the villagers make home. Moreover, the forest is specially reserved by villagers of the proposed site to maintain a good ecological environment. For ecological safety, local people tend to build their villages near the dense forests, which can become the green barrier behind the village to conserve water, prevent soil erosion, purify air and beautify environment. Ther e are many Fengshui forests in the site (Figure 40). Figure 40 Distribution of Fengshui forests in the proposed site Fengshui forest is reserved for the sake of maintaining a good living environment. Local people believe that it has the meaning of \"auspiciousness\" and \"prayer\". It can also guarantee the clean and steady flow of the water (Figure 41). Both logging and grazing are prohibited in Fengshui forests. Fengshui forests are not only an ancient forest community and a gene bank of tree species resources, but also an important embodiment of the forest conservation consciousness of Gumin . Due to its meaning, everyone conscious ly protects Fengshui forests. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 73 There are many local rules and regulations for the protection of Fengshui forests established by local people through long social practice. Firstly, the residents are not allowed to burn charcoal, cut firewood or saw wood in t he Fengshui forests. Secondly, it is not allowed to raise livestock, especially cattle, sheep and other herbivores in the Fengshui forest, so as to prevent damage to undergrowth. Thirdly, it is not allowed to excavate building stones and dig soil in the Fengshui forest, so as to avoid to damage the original aboveground vegetation and landscape. The local residents have been consciously followed the above -mentioned rules and regulations, so that the forest resources in the site has been effectively protected . Figure 41 Fengshui forests often locate on the water source where the trees grow densely. Local people believe it can become the green barrier of the village and guarantee the clean and steady flow of the water. (5) Obtaining Yinshu - a custom for a good harvest of mushroom Yinshu is a kind of tree for mushroom cultivation and means wealth in Gumin 's minds. Every year after breakfast on the first day of the first lunar month, Gumin go to mountains to obtain Yinshu . The size of Yinshu is unlimited. In order to protect the leaves well, Gumin digged and carried the tree on his back, go back and put it in front of the Gumin' s shack . The Yinshu is pasted with red paper around the trunk for a circle, placed until Lantern Festival, and then burned down. The ceremony implies a bumper mushroom harvest in the coming year and a rolling source of money. At the same time, the ceremony adds a festive and lively atmosphere. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 74 4.2 Mushroom Culture with a Long History (1) Belief of Gumin related to mushr oom cultivation A. Gushen Temple Fair. Gushen means the god of mushroom, namely Wu Sangong. Gushen Temple Fair held every year from July 16 to 19 of the lunar calendar is a major sacrificial festival for Gumin who go out to cultivate mushrooms. Because Gumin cultivate mushrooms in deep mountains from December to April and come back home in other times, migratory bird life leads them to have few festivals such as Spring Festival and Lantern Festival. Gumin must go to Gushen temple to thank god and offer sacrifices when they go out to cultivate mushrooms. The annual Gushen Temple Fair becomes the carnival after a year's hard work for Gumin . During the temple fair, thousands of Gumin jointly worship Wu Sangong (Figure 42). At the same time, they take the tem ple fair as an exchange opportunity to discuss major plans, carry out technical exchanges and theatrical entertainment, celebrate harvest, practice boxing and martial arts, meet relatives and friends and so on. In 2007, Gushen Temple Fair was included in t he second batch of Zhejiang Intangible Cultural Heritage List. Figure 42 Gushen Temple Fair is a major sacrificial festival for Gumin who go out to cultivate mushrooms. During the temple fair, thousands of Gumin jointly worship their ancestor Wu Sangong, who is also regarded as the god of mushroom ( Gushen ). B. Greeting God Temple Fair . Greeting God is an important traditional folk activity in the site. It has been handed down for more than 600 years, and its importance is no less than the Spring Festival. Greeting God Temple Fair is held at a specific time of the GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 75 year, usually in early July each year around the Slight Heat, but the specific time of each village is different. The duration usually varies from two to four days, and there are as many as ten da ys and a half month. During this time, local residents carry all the gods in the Buddhist temple to the lobby of Greeting God Hall for worship, and then hold a grand sacrificial worship activity. After the ceremony of sacrifice and prayer, the gods are inv ited back to the Buddhist temple (Figure 43). This custom is a kind of sacrificial prayer for a year's good weather and prosperous grain. It also takes into account the functions of celebration, entertainment and cultural promotion. Figure 43 Greeting G od Temple Fair - carrying the gods. After the ceremony of sacrifice and prayer, the gods are invited back to the Buddhist temple. C. Gushan Altar . Gushan Altar is a place where gods are worshiped in the Gumin' s shack when Gumin go up the mountains. Most of these gods are brought out from their homes by the principal of the shack, and the gods are placed in the center of the shack , facing the eastern door. In the middle is \"the throne of the Great Emperor of the Five Immortal Off icers\", on the left is \"the Xiyang Temple Wu Sangong\", and on the right is \"the National Master Liu Bowen \"; there are also left and right writings such as \"Land God for the Hill, Qiwu King of the Southern Upper Palace\" or \"Fortune boy, the God of Recruitin g Money Every Day\". There are also couplets and batches at the entrance of this kind of shack s. The arrangement of the god's position in shack s reflects the belief mentality of the Gumin in a specific historical period. Gumin have lived far away from home for generations in remote and deep mountains, in the face of difficulties, they GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 76 wish for God's blessings to protect them. Therefore, special attention is paid to the worship of gods on the altar. Among them, the Five Immortal Officers are the most widely w orshiped gods in villages. Folk legend goes that this God commands all kinds of gods, disseminates production technique to Gumin , and blesses Gumin with auspicious seasons and plentiful clothes and food. Wu Sangong is the first one on the left and Liu Bowe n is the first one on the right. Both of them are the gods revered by Gumin . The Qiwu king is the god who can subdue the world's poisonous insects and beasts. Gumin use its divine power to protect themselves from the poisonous insects and beasts. Then ther e is the Shanshen . The Gumin pray that he will bless the mushroom harvest and safety (Figure 44). D. Gumin Incense List. Gumin have been following the custom of believing in Gushen . Almost every mushroom family has a shrine dedicated to Wu Sangong, the god of mushroom. On the top of the desk there is a list of incense. The ranking of the gods is similar to that of the Gushan Altar. Sacrifice activities are held on the 14th and 29th days of the lunar month (Figure 45). E. Redeem a vow to a god and pray for blessings . There is a custom of redeeming a vow to a god and pray for blessings, which is a prayer activity for Gumin to go out to the mountain forests in other places. The event is held every other year, and the specific Figure 44 Worship of gods in the shack. Gumin pray that gods will bless mushroom harvest and safety. Figure 45 Incense list in Gumin family. On the top of the desk there is a list of incense showing the ranking of the gods. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 77 date is chosen by folk diviner (Mr. Yin and Yang ). When the auspicious day is coming, the folk diviner is invited to choose the time. As soon as the lu cky hour arrives, the Gushen or incense burner in the temple is carried to the ancestral house of the village to let the Gushen \"watch\" Gumin Opera performance and pray for a good harvest for Gumin in the coming year. On this day, Gumin volunteered to pay money and food for the play and to make a large number of rice steamed bread distributed to the public, in order to show happiness and auspiciousness. The scenes are very lively, with the beating of gongs and drums resounding to the skies (Figure 46). Figure 46 Redeeming a vow to a god and praying for blessings. The Gushen or incense burner in the temple is carried to the ancestral house of the village to let the Gushen \"watch\" Gumin Opera performance and pray for a good harvest for Gumin in the coming year. F. Enshrining master in the Gumin's shack . Wu Sangong is respected by Gumin for generations as the god of mushroom and master. Every lucky day of the 14th and 29th days of the lunar month, Gumin will devoutly worship Wu Sangong and hold sacrificial activities such as greeting god. This kind of ceremony is called enshrining master, or \" Fenggoudeng \". At the beginning of the ceremony, Wu Sangong is sacrificed in the shacks. Firstly, Gumin write \"the most favorable auspices\" on red paper and stick it on the incense table. On the table, they put an axe on the left and a chopper on the right, sprinkle a handful of rice, and burn pork with hot water. Then they put the pork on the incense table to invite the master to pray for a good harvest in that year. Se condly, GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 78 it is to place some sacrifices at the entrance of the shack gate to worship the gods, in order to seek the blessings of the gods. Thirdly, Gumin set up a flat shelf not far from the entrance to the shack corner, then put a bowl of rice and several pieces of meat on the wooden board to worship the souls of the mountain and pray for a good harvest. Fourthly, in the lower terrain under the trees or near the rocks outside the shack, three stones are used to build a platform for offering sacrifices to th e mountain elf. The mountain elf is a \"ghost\" tabooed by all Gumin . They dare not neglect it, and dare not kill it. At the end of the ceremony, the head of the shack will sort clothes, wash hands, burn incense paper, then grab two handfuls of rice from the rice box with incense inserted with both hands. While scattering the rice around, he murmurs \"go up the hills to cut trees, cultivate mushroom s, burn charcoal, travel, clean the table for dinner\". Then all the Gumin in the shack say in chorus \"we come\". So far, the ceremony is over and Gumin can talk, do things, burn fire, or cut meat to improve the usual bland meals. (2) Living customs formed by forest and mushroom co -culture A. Guodan . When Gumin cultivate mushroom s in mountain forests, they not only worship the Wu Sangong in the shed, but also worship the gods in the Mountain Elf Temple, which commonly known as \" Guodan \" (Figure 47). At the mouth of the mountain about one or two miles away from the Gumin 's shack, th ree huge stones are superimposed, which is called Mountain Elf Temple. Figure 47 Three huge stones are superimposed at the mouth of the mountain near the Gumin 's shack, which is called Mountain Elf Temple. When Gumin cultivate mushrooms in mountain forests, they also worship the gods in the Mountain Elf Temple. B. Taking a Guyu bath. Every autumn when maple leaves drift away, Gumin have GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 79 a tradition of having a Guyu bath. On this day, every household of Gumin has to make fried glutinous pudding and kill pigs. Women should eat vegetarian and bathe. After bathing, people worship the gods in Wu Sangong Temple at the entrances of villages with fried glutinous pudding and meat, pray for Gushen to bless relatives. C. Having farewell meal. Farewell meal is a diet with folk rituals. Gumin go to mountain forests on auspicious days with the numbers of three, six and nine. On the night before leaving home, the whole family have to eat a farewell meal. The farewell meal is presided over by the elder in the family. The elder burns incense, lights candles before the meal, and then pours wine and raises glasses to pray to the \"Heaven\" and \"Nether World\" and wish a good luck and safe return to home for Gumin . D. Making Qiyueba n steamed bread. Qiyueban steamed bread is a specific folk eating customs, instead of usual traditional food, it includes specific sacrifice function and worship time. On the fifteenth day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, every family in the sit e has to make Qiyueban steamed bread, burn incense to worship their ancestors. The best glutinous rice is chosen and soaked in water, ground into paste and pressed to dry, then kneaded into the skin of the filling. There are many kinds of stuffing for stea med bread. One is steamed red beans mashed and mixed with brown sugar to form a ball; the other is sticky rice mixed with brown sugar; another is to mix brown sugar with dried bitter vegetables. Qiyueban steamed bread is white, crystal -clear, soft and refr eshing, it is very popular among people, especially the elderly and children. E. Taking fried glutinous pudding to mountains. The eating of fried glutinous pudding contains specific folk rituals and eating scenes, so it's not a normal traditional food. In the past, folk proverbs spread in villages include the lyrics of \"making fried glutinous pudding to leave Zhejiang\" and \"making more fried glutinous pudding to go to mountains\". This is a warning for Gumin to save money and prepare enough dishes before going up the mountains to cultivate mushrooms, when they leave their homes, they should bring more fried glutinous pudding to eat on the road. The quantity depends on the number of people going out and the di stance. Usually, each person prepares 2 -3 blocks a day, and the Gumin will have the pudding for three meals. Eating method is also very simple, in the morning and evening, Gumin put salt and add cabbage to cook it in water in the inn; at noon, they can gat her firewood on the road and cook it. F. Having Wufan . Wufan is a kind of rice mixed with black juice of a shrub called Wufanlu . Having Wufan on the eighth day of April in the lunar calendar is a folk custom in the site , which has a long history and is han ded down from generation to generation. To make Wufan , people boil the leaves of Wufanlu in a pot, put its black juice into glutinous rice, add some lean meat and mushrooms and stir. After that, all of them can be cooked through gentle heat to form a uniqu e black rice. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 80 G. Keeping a Gushan dog. Gushan dog is a domestic breed and very loyal to its owner. It is often brought to mountain forests to guard the shack. Gumin live in forests and often encounter various dangers. When venomous snakes or beasts invade the living area at night, the alert and loyal Gushan dog will bark loudly to remind the owner and at the same time help the owner to drive and fight the beast (Figu re 48). Figure 48 Gushan dog, a domestic breed and very loyal to its owner, is often brought to mountain forests to guard the shack. (3) Folklore art related to mushroom production and trade A. Gumin Opera. Gumin Opera originated in the eastern of Qingyuan, which was called Erdu in ancient times, so it is also called Erdu Opera (Figure 49). Gumin Opera originated in the mid -Ming Dynasty (1436 A.D. -1566 A.D.). At that time, Erdu farmers depend on going out to cultivate mushrooms to make a living. The Gumin who went to Jiangxi, Fujian and other provinces learned arias from Jiangxi Opera and Luantan Opera from the local people. After adding some dialects of Qingyuan and through several generations of oral communication , an embryo of Gumin Opera was formed. After a long period of development, Gumin Opera was formed as a multi -aria plate cavity opera combining song, dance and drama, based on Qingyuan dialect as a basic language, with beautiful arias and distinctive local features. In 2007, Gumin Opera was included in the second batch of Zhejiang Intangible Cultural Heritage List. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 81 Figure 49 Gumin Oper, also called Erdu Opera , a is a multi -aria plate cavity opera combining song, dance and drama, based on Qingyuan dialect as a basic language, with beautiful arias and distinctive local features. B. Xianggu Kungku . Gumin use simple poles, sticks, axes and other equipment, combi ne traditional martial arts movements such as kicking, beating, wrestling, holding, falling, hitting, splitting, stabbing to form a martial art suitable for the mountainous environment attack and defense fighting, which called Xianggu Kungku (Figure 50). Xianggu Kungku is also known as self -defense skills of Gumin , which is an important part of the mushroom cultures. In the past, Gumin need to live and work in the mountain forests for nearly half a year. There were many tigers and leopards in the dense forests of southern China, which attacked people and animals. I n addition, the mushroom has been regarded as a precious mountain treasure since ancient times. It is inevitably plundered by bandits and gangsters. Therefore, Gumin need to practice a set of self - defense skills in order to strengthen their health and self -protection, and Xianggu Kungku came into being as the times require. Xianggu Kungku 's tactics and forms are all the needs of Gumin for self -defense and self -protection. The peak period of Xianggu Kungku belonged to the late Ming and early Qing Dynasty (1 600 A.D. -1644 A.D.). At that time, there were competitions during the temple fair held every year in the Xiyang Temple, and Gumin came from far and near to participate in the competitions. In 2012, Xianggu Kungku was listed in the Intangible Cultural Herit age List of Zhejiang Province. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 82 Figure 50 Xianggu Kungku is a self-defense skill of Gumin . Gumin combine simple equipment and traditional martial arts movements to form a martial art suitable for the mountainous environment attack and defense fighting. C. Xianggu Folk Song. Xianggu Folk Song is chanted by Gumin in work or daily life, which is different from the Gumin Opera performed on stage. The lyrics of Xianggu Folk Songs usually have three aspects. Firstly, it is to express the mushroom production scene and bitterness or joy in labor. Secondly, it is to reflect the spiritual belief and life pursuit of Gumin. Thirdly, it is to sing the secret of mushroom techniq ues. Therefore, Xianggu Folk Songs are formed with the mushroom cultivation and spread with the expansion of mushroom trade. Xianggu Folk songs eulogize the history of mushroom cultivation, inherit the unique mushroom cultivation techniques, and show the Gumin 's inner pursuit and labor scene. They are rich in content, easy to understand and catchy and have been handed down by generations (Figure 51). GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 83 Figure 51 Xianggu Folk Song is chanted by Gumin in work or daily life. They are formed with the mushroom c ultivation and spread with the expansion of mushroom trade. D. Gushan proverb. Gushan proverb is a popular and easy -to-understand, concise phrase and rhyme widely spread among the people of the site. It mostly reflects the daily life of Gumin and the practical experience of mushroom cultivation. It is usually passed down orally. The hard life of mountain forests has sharpened generations of Gumin who take mushrooms as their industry. Gumin have continuously explored and summarized various expe riences and lessons of mushroom cultivation in countless times of work from year to year, leaving behind many Gushan proverbs. For example, \"one -year-snow, three -year-rest\", it means that if there is heavy snow in winter, the production of mushrooms will b e reduced in future three years, because overwintering mushrooms will be frozen. \"Removing shielding in the first year, the second year will be Dangwang , there are two peak periods in the third year, and there will be empty production in the fourth year\" , it means that there is only a little harvest in the first year, good harvest in the second and third years, and little harvest in the fourth year. This is a proverb about the production cycle of Duohua . \"When the maple leaves fall, the husband and wife are separated; when the maple tree is budding, the husband returns home\", this is a proverb reflecting the season of mushroom production. The husband goes out to cultivate mushroom s when the maple leaves fall in autumn and returns home from the mountain when the maple tree is budding in spring. E. Gushan Dialect. It is a special language used in the daily communication between GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 84 Gumin in the site and other places, also known as \" Guliaobai \",\"Xunshanhua \" or \"Shanliaobai \". In ancient times, there was no \"patent\" law for intellectual property protection, and all technical inventions needed to be protected by their own defense. Gumin have regarded the method of Duohua as a divine teaching, only allowing the father and son t o pass it on orally, strictly abiding by the outside world, violators will be scolded by god. Mushroom cultivation is the main means of livelihood for Gumin . In order not to make the Duohua technique be mastered by outsiders, a unique secret language \" Gush an Dialect\" has been created, which can only be understood by oneself. Gushan Dialect was produced on the basis of Qingyuan local dialect. Its language, vocabulary and grammar are basically the same as that of Qingyuan local dialect. Its main difference is the change of word meaning, which makes it very different from the local dialect of Qingyuan and makes it difficult for the non -local people to understand it. In the past, Gumin use Gushan Dialect for information exchange after going out. All Gumin could not only understand but also speak Gushan Dialect. Those who do not speak will be regarded as laymen who do not understand the rules of Gushan (namely mountain forests). Therefore, whether or not to speak the \" Gushan Dialect\" has become a \"standard\" to tes t whether the farmers are real Gumin . F. Folklore about two huge Cryptomeria fortune trees. In front of Wu Sangong Temple in Longyan Village, there have two huge Cryptomeria fortune trees. The trees are said to be sticks and poles inserted by Wu Sangong. L ater, two Cryptomeria fortune trees grew, one like a stick and one like a pole. As legend has it, Gumin in Longyan Village held sacrificial activities on August thirteenth of the lunar calendar every year, Wu Sangong would ride the black tiger to the ances tral temple to participate in sacrificial activities with Gumin and often leave tiger footprints in the fields. G. Patent given by emperor. It's said that in the early Ming Dynasty (A.D. 1368) , the mushroom was tribute to the founding emperor Zhu Yuanzhang (1328 -1398 ) and received his great appreciation. The founding hero of the Ming Dynasty, Liu Bowen from Zhejiang , told the emperor Zhu Yuanzhang about the difficulties of Gumin 's livelihood and expected more support from imperial court. The emperor issued an edict of granting Qingyuan mushroom as a court tribute, granted Qingyuan the patent for mushroom production, and conferred Wu Sangong the title of \"The Prince of Food and Soup\". In the three years of Wanli in Ming Dynasty (A.D. 1575), the emperor again awarded Wu Sangong with the title of \"The Judgment of the Government\". (4) Catering culture formed from agricultural and forestry products A. Hundred Mushroom Feast . Hundred Mushroom Feast is a traditional banquet in the site. Local people always pay attention to the forest and mushroom co -culture and protect forest ecosystems well. Therefore, a large number of wild edible fungi grow in GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 85 the forest and people call the m \"Delicacies\", which is the most precious local cuisine. Using a variety of wild edible fungi to make Hundred Mushroom Feast to entertain guests has been a long -term history for several hundred years in the site. The ancients had the custom of \"no ingredients without bamboo shoots, no banquet without mushrooms\". The Hundred Mushroom Feast with main ingredients of wild edible fungi adopts a variety of cooking tech niques such as stewed, smoked, quick -fry stewed and steamed, with more than 200 flavors. The products are various and elaborate, excellen t in taste, color, fragrance and shape. It has a light and pleasant south taste and a fresh fragrant and salty north taste (Figure 52). Figure 52 Local people use a variety of wild edible fungi to make Hundred Mushroom Feast to entertain guests. B. Sheguo . At every spring temple in the site, there has the custom of making a kind of local pasta, which is Sheguo . Every spring, in the fields and wet slopes, there is a kind of yellow -flowering herb growing everywhere, commonly known as Shequ (the scienti fic name is Gnaphalium affine ). At the season of spring temple, the tender buds of Shequ first grow, women go to the field to pick, and then put in the mortar to be pounded into a viscous sauce, mixed with glutinous rice pulp and caked into pancakes, known as Sheguo . The color is emerald green, sweet and palatable. It can relieve cough and regulate Qi (Figure 53). GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 86 Figure 53 Sheguo is a kind of local pasta made from a yellow -flowering herb at the season of spring temple. Figure 54 Qingmingguo, the egg-shaped rice balls with mixed ingredients, is made by local people every year in Tomb Sweeping Day (about early April). GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 87 C. Qingmingguo . Every year in Tomb Sweeping Day (about early April), local people all made Qingmingguo in the site. Qingmingguo has s trong characteristics of forest cultures, composed of green coriander, tender bamboo shoots, mushroom diced, and shredded meat with related spice. After all raw m aterials mix and cook thoroughly, japonica rice is poured into and mixed evenly, then it is kn ead into egg -shaped rice balls, which is called Qingmingguo (Figure 54). D. Huangguo . Every year in November and December of the lunar calendar, almost every household in the site has to make a necessary food - Huangguo . Huangguo is made of Japonica rice as the main raw material and alkaloids from the baking of Eucalyptus branches and leaves as the auxiliary material. It is made by washing, soaking, cooking, stamping and shaping in more than 10 processes. After making Huangguo , they are green and transparent in appearance, easy to store for a long time and easy to cook. It tastes chewy, fragrant and delicious (Figure 55). Figure 55 Huangguo is made of Japonica rice and alkaloids by every household every year in November and Dece mber of the lunar calendar. E. Lixia soup. Beginning of summer is one of the traditional 24 solar terms in early May. At that moment, Gumin have returned home from the Gushan . On this day, people will cook Lixia soup and greet their neighbors to share it (Figure 56). The cooking method of Lixia soup is simple. The glutinous rice is ground into water powder, then mixed with ground meat, bamboo shoots, dried cuttlefish and mushrooms, and cooked GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 88 in a large pot. Loca l proverb says: \"taking the Lixia soup of 7 families, people will have most brilliant looks in later ages\". Figure 56 Lixia soup is a glutinous rice soup people drink at the beginning of summer in early May. Locao people belive that having Lixia soup can bring good lucky. F. Sunzong . Sunzong is a flavored food and can best embody the characteristics of mountain forests in the site. Because there has a large bamboo forest, so fresh bamboo shoots can be collected every year. This is the raw materia l for making Sunzong . It is called Sunzong because of the use of bamboo shoot oil in its production. Bamboo shoot soup will be condensed into gelatinous form by boiling, which is bamboo shoot oil. When making, the glutinous rice is washed and mixed with a proper amount of bamboo shoot oil to make the rice soak as much as possible. Then it is wrapped with bamboo shoot shell and boiled in a pottery stove for one day and one night. After being cooked, it is delicious and loved by people (Figure 57). G. Xiaomei . Xiaomei is an indispensable snack at the banquet in the site, which is made of sweet potato flour mixed with lard and sugar. The cooking method is to fry sweet potato flour in a pan, sprinkle with sugar, add pure lard and stir evenly, and then knead it h ard into small round balls, put it in the plates to be steamed. Xiaomei is shaped like plum, and that is the source of its name. After steaming, a transparent film is formed on the surface of Xiaomei , which is smooth, while inside it is crisp and soft, swe et and delicious. It is a unique local famous snack in the site (Figure 58). GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 89 Figure 57 Sunzong is a flavored food and can best embody the characteristics of mountain forests in the site.

GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 90 (5) Traditional farm tools suitable for agricultural production Farming tools serve as the historical witness of the farming cultures in the site. Most of the farm tools listed below have been replaced with modern production tools. Some of them can be seen occasionally as collections of Gumin . A. Mushroom p roduction tools. They are used for mushroom cultivation, including Duohua axes for chopping slits in bark to facilitate the growth of spores, hand saws for sawing thin wood, wood choppers for removing excess branches of trees, mushroom baskets for picking mushrooms, large bamboo baskets for transporting and storing mushrooms, sieve baskets for sunning fresh mushrooms picked and for drying them in a Gumin' s shack , and other common tools (Figure 59). Figure 59 Tools used for mushroom production commonly Duohua axe Hand saw Wood chopper Mushroom basket Bamboo basket Sieve basket GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 91 B. Agricultural production tools. The first category is land preparation tools used for plowing, breaking soil, leveling ground, weeding and so on, such as plows used for breaking soil clods and plowing out furrows, harrows for leveling paddy fields after plowing, and hoes for farming, wee ding and loosening soil. The second category is planting tools used for transportation, transplanting and fertilization, such as seedling clamps used for transporting vegetables or other seedlings from dry fields, rice seedling transplanters for transplant ing operation, and fertilizing pots for carrying farmyard manure. The third category is crop harvesting tools, such as sickles for weeding or reaping, threshing buckets or threshing machines for separating paddy from stalks, grain sieves for removing stems , leaves, weeds, etc. from paddy, rice hullers for removing chaff of grains of rice, and grain blowers for grain cleaning (Figure 60, Figure 61).

Gushen temple . It is a place to worship Gushen and gathering site for Gumin . Xiyang Temple in the site, the largest Gushen temple in China, is located on the bank of Songyuan River in Xiyang village, adjacent to Lanxi Bridge. It is a memorial building built by ancient Gumin to commemorate Wu Sangong (Figure 62). Founded in the first year of Xianchun in the Song Dynasty (A.D. 1265), after several changes, in the first year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (A.D. 1875), it was rebuilt by Gumin from Qingyuan, Longquan and Jingning counties. Most Gumin go to the Xiyang Temple to worship Wu Sangong when they leave home, praying for a good harvest, peace and prosperity, and a safe return to home. Today, the Xiyang Temple is the symbol of the \"Source of Xianggu \". Every year, from the July 16th to 19th of the lunar month is the Sickle Threshing bucket Threshing machine Grain sieve Rice huller Grain blower GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 93 period for farmers to pay tribute in the Xiyang Temple. The Gumin from surrounding townships gather here to worship. In 2013, Xiyang Temple was included in the Seventh Group of National Key Cultural Relics Protection Units. Figure 62 Xiyang Temple is the largest Gushen temple in China. It is a memorial building built by ancient Gumin to commemorate Wu Sangong. Today, the Xiyang Temple is the symbol of the \"Source of Xianggu \". Figure 63 Wu Sangong Ancestral Temple, located in Longyan Vallige, was built by Gumin to GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 94 commemorate their ancestor Wu Sangong. B. Ancestral temple . Ancestral temple is a sacred place for ancestor worship. Clans usually make the most of their financial and material resources to build magnificent ancestral temples with high -quality wood and stone. The ancestral temples in the site includes two categor ies: clan ancestral temples and memorial temples of historical celebrities. There are a large number of ancestral temples, which are widely distributed in the site. The famous ancestral temples include Ancestral Temple of Wu Family in Huangpi village and W u Sangong Ancestral Temple in Longyan Village . Wu Sangong Ancestral Temple was built by Gumin to commemorate Wu Sangong (Figure 63). Gumin regularly offer sacrifices and carry out activities in Wu Sangong Ancestral Temple, celebrating the harvest through t emple fairs, and praying for a bumper harvest in the coming year, and then forming a unique temple fair culture. C. Langqiao . The site is surrounded by mountains and winding streams. Gumin built a large number of Langqiao , not only helps to facilitate the crossing of the river, but also provides shelters for passers -by. Langqiao , also known as Roof Bridge and wind - rain Bridge, is a special bridge formed by building gallery houses on the bridge deck, which is divided into three categories, including wooden a rch, flat beam and stone arch. Among them, wooden arch Langqiao has scientific structure, beautiful shape, which is a wonder in the classical architectural art, and a unique category in the history of bridges in the world. Langqiao is not only exquisite in bridge construction technique, but also has a wide range of practical functions and profound cultural connotations. Most of the funds for building and repairing bridges are mainly derived from Gumin . The precipitation in the site is extremely abundant, th e closed bridges body not only shelters the rain from Gumin who go up hills or return home, but also provide the places for mushrooms trading. In addition, there are shrines to enshrine Gushen and other gods in the middle of the bridge for Gumin to worship . When Gumin go out to cultivate mushrooms or return home, they often go to this place to offer sacrifices. In 2009, \"Traditional construction technique of Chinese wooden arch Langqiao \" was included in the UN's first batch of List of Intangible Cultural He ritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding , and Qingyuan County is one of the specific areas declared. In 2013, Lanxi Bridge and Huangshui Long Bridge (Figure 64) in the site were announced as the seventh group of the National Key Cultural Relic Protection Units in China. D. Gumin's shack . At the stage of waiting for the growth of mushrooms and baking mushrooms, Gumin need to live in the remote mountains for at least half a year. For this reason, they usually build simple shacks with stoves, beds, drying roo ms and shrines with bamboo, wood and thatch as raw materials. Such a temporary residence is called a Gumin' s shack (Figure 65), also known as the second home of Gumin . With the GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 95 passage of time, Gumin's shack s have gradually evolved into a cultural landscap e, witnessing the development of the mushroom cultures. Figure 64 Langqiao (Corridor Bridge) formed by building gallery houses on the bridge deck. Gumin built a large number of Langqiao to facilitate the crossing of the river and to provide shelters for passers -by in the site. Figure 65 Gumin's shack is Gumin' s temporary residence at the stage of waiting for the growth GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 96 of mushrooms and baking mushrooms. 4.3 Cultural Characteristics of QFMCS (1) Nature worship of animism Nature worship is a behavior that consider natural things and natural forces as objects with life, will and great abilities and regard them with awe and belief. In ancient times, when facing incomprehensible natural phenomena, people felt alarmed at first and then worshiped them piou sly. Further, they prayed for god's blessings. Gradually, people formed their endogenous consciousness of observing the world and revering the nature, and Gumin were no exception in the site . Gumin believe that everything has spirit, so they have the cust om of worship ping Shanshen , acknowledging Shuniang , sacrificing Fengshui forest, etc. They explain natural phenomena by these cultures and customs, and construct the interactive relationship between human and the environment . In addition, they strengthen t he collective consciousness of respecting and protecting forests through customs and ceremonies of mountain forest protection. Besides, the way of treating mountain forests by Gumin is regulated by local rules. Finally, they pray for god's blessings throug h sacrificial ceremonies in order to ensure the source of livelihood, safety and health. (2) Gushen worship derived from people 's gratitude to ancestors Gushen worship is a major part of mushroom culture s in the site . The manifestation of Gushen worship is mainly composed of customs including god thrones, god temples, sacrific ing Gushen and Gushen Temple Fair. The worship is entwined with the production and living environment of Gumin and has a variety of functions such as prayer for blessings, m oral pursuit, behavior restraint and order maintenance. Gumin live in a harsh environment and need to seek psychological dependence, so they hope Gushen to bless them. Once this belief is formed, it is passed down as a custom. In the past, Gumin cultivated mushroom s in remote mountains for a long time and exchanged them for food and daily supplies. They thought that cutting down the trees to cultivate mushroom s was a gift from the gods. And it was their ancestor Wu Sangong that sent them blessings on behalf of the gods. Therefore, Wu Sangong was regarded as the \"God of Mushroom\" by Gumin (Figure 66), and the Gushen temple was built as a special place of worship. Their vague understanding of mushroom cultivation technique explain ed why they are so devo ted to Wu Sangong. With time going by, this piety forms the worship of Wu Sangong and lasts till now. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 97 Figure 66 Wu Sangong, a native of Langgyan Village, was ranked third, and so his nickname was Third Wu. Also because he invented the Duohua technique, Wu was honored as the god of mushroom. (3) Technique improvement sticking to forest and mushroom co -culture The identification and ingestion of wild edible fung i have promoted the development of human civilization. The mushroom cultivation tec hnique in the site is constantly innovated, reflecting the historical process of advancing with the times and developing in a coordinated way . The techn ical inheritance and innovation of QFMCS from the utilization of wild edible fung i to the artificial mushroom cultivation through Duohua method , and then w ood log and substitute material method s, has always adhered to the thought of \"harmony between man and nature and reverence of nature\". The Duohua method showed the beginning of the artificial mushroom cultivation . After the invention of strain inoculation technique, the cultivation experiments of wood log and substitute material method s were carried out in the site to resolve the problems of scattered sites and low production efficie ncy of Duohua cultivation technique . In particular, the substitute material method, which comprehensively uses the forest logging residue s, waste wood, thinning wood and so on, represents another techn ical leap of mushroom production. It leads to the green , pollution -free and recyclable production of mushroom, thus promoting the co -evolution of economy, society and ecology of traditional agricultural production system. (4) Village rules and regulations handed down by generation s GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 98 The village rules and regulations passed down by generations in the site maintain the social order, social public morality and village customs , and regulate the villagers' behaviors. In the organization and management of villages, ancestors emphasized the protection of ecology, and almost every village has its own rules and regulations . For example, you have to kill your own pig for all the villages to eat if you cut woods in mountains or you must dig bamboo shoots within the time allowed, besides, you should set small fish free when fishing and do not catch birds when they brood eggs, etc . Gumin live in harmony with various animals and plants, forming a simple thought of ecological protection and awareness of sustainable use of environment resources. When Gumin move to other places to cultivate mushroom s, there is a rule of \"three no\", indicating no poison, no bird gun, and no killing, which is the code of conduct and the criterion of value that Gumin of all dynasties abide by jointly. These rules and regulatio ns handed down by generation s have left the living space for animals and plants, and also effectively protected the ecological environment, profoundly reflected the simple ecological protection thought of the ancestors. For thousands of years, the way of l ife of cultivating mushroom s under the forest s and farming beside the forest s has avoided large -scale deforestation, reduced or even put an end to soil erosion in mountain areas, and created a sustainable development mode of forest and mushroom co -culture. 4.4 Social Organizations Adapting to System Development (1) Jinshan association and protection regulations to protect forest resources Jinshan means \"closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation\". In order to ensure the growth and breeding of forest trees, regulations such as prohibiting logging and grazing in the mountains have been formulated. In the past, there has a Jinshan association for the purpose of protecting forests in the site. In the early 20th century, the association was renamed \" Local Forest Protection Association\". Some villages set up their own association respectively, and some jointly set up one. In generally, senior villagers who are of virtue, pres tige and justice are elected to make up the association s, and a lot of activities are h eld every year, such as Jinshan shows, publicity of Jinshan agreements, posting of forest protection notices and punishing violators, aiming to promote the villagers to abide by the rules together and consciously protect the forests. The Jinshan association is responsible for the maintenance of trees around ancestral temples, temples, schools, roads, bridges, and other places in the village, as well as the prohibition aga inst logging and grazing in the forests. The Jinshan association has formulated a Prohibition Agreement and a Notice to restrict villagers' behavior. The management is very strict and violators will be punished according to the regulations. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 99 Sometimes, publicity methods such as beat ing the gongs, kill ing pigs and having special meals are used for conservation. Many of the existing Fengshui forests, official road shelter belts, scenic forests, and ancient and famous trees in the site are the fruits of closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation by the predecessors. Today, the forest protection has evolved from the spontaneous nongovernmental Jinshan association to the laws and regulations of forest protection formulated by the state. In 2019, the Forest Law of the People' s Republic of China revised and published, which stipulates that the strictest legal system should be implemented to protect forests, trees and woodlands according to the principle of ecol ogical priority. (2) Gumin 's self-governing organization to safeguard their interests The earliest mushroom industry organization in Chinese history is \" Sanhe hall\". This Gumin 's self -governing organization, elected by Gumin in the community, is usually composed of the local respected township leaders, elites, skilled craftsmen, and other representative figures. They are responsible for safeguarding the interests of the Gumin and the production order of the mushroom industry, supervising and regulating the irregular deeds and norms, and performing the governance power of the mushroom industry organization . Every July of the lunar calendar, representatives of Gumin gather in Maoke ngkou of Jingning County to discuss and confirm matters related to the sales of mushrooms in the year. The existing Mushroom Public Office in Maokengkou covers an area of 3 mu, revealing the prosperity of the mushroom industry at that time. \" Sanhe hall Mon ument\" (Figure 67) and words of \"Mushroom Public Office\" on the outer wall of the house witnessed the supreme power of the mushroom industry organization . Afterwards, most of the mushroom industry organization's activities were held during the period of temple fair held in Xiyang Temple , because this temple fair became a must -go pilgrimage place for Gumin gradually. In 1896, Zhejiang Mushroom Industry Guild Hall, the earliest mushroom industry Figure 67 Sanhe hall is the earliest Gumin's self- governing organization. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 100 organization in the form of modern civil society, was establishe d in Jian'ou County, Fujian Province. In the early 20th century, with the increasing market awareness of Gumin and the expansion of mushroom trade, organizations such as \" Gumin 's Townsmen Association\" and \"Mushroom Industry Guild Hall\" were successively se t up as liaison centers of Gumin from Qingyuan scattered all over the country. If their production, life and property are damaged, they can appeal to the \"Mushroom Industry Guild Hall\" and obtain legal aid. (3) Trading places responsible for mushroom sales Mushroom guild is a trading places responsible for mushroom sales, which has played a special role in the long history of mushroom development in Qingyuan County. The mushroom guild is a mutually beneficial organization between Gumin and businesses. With a wide range of sales channels in selling products, it can solve difficulties and problems for Gumin and has a certain reputation among Gumin . Mushroom guilds have an interest relationship with Gumin , both of them can obtain corresponding interests by each other (Figure 68). Figure 68 Mushroom guild is a trading places responsible for mushroom sales, and also a mutually beneficial organization between Gumin and businesses. In the first half of the 20th century, the mushroom guilds founded in other provinces by Qingyuan County played an important role in organizing mushroom production and communicating sales channels. According to documentary records, Qingyuan County set up m ore than 100 mushroom guilds all over the country from 1941 to 1949, with more than 310 reception rooms. These guilds provided convenient accommodation and GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 101 trade for mushroom framers when they travelled between mountain forests and trading places. Usually, during the mushroom harvest season in November, local mushroom guilds can advance some funds and travel expenses for the economically disadvantaged Gumin , as well as prepare meals and beds for them internally, so as to enhance the relationships with the f armers, stabilize the supply of mushrooms, and ensure the benefit of both the production and marketing of mushroom. Qingyuan mushroom market built in 1991 is a historical continuation and sublimation of the mushroom guild. The market is mainly engaged in m ushroom trade, with more than 30 mushroom series products is the largest specialized wholesale mushroom market in China and the largest refrigeration center for agricult ural and sideline products in southwest Zhejiang Province. In 2015, new market was officially put into operation and mushroom industry of Qingyuan was at a new starting point. At present, there are two main types of social organizations in the heritage sit e. One is the self -governing organization of farmers, such as mushroom planting and managing cooperatives and villagers' committees , mainly responsible for regularly collecting of farmer's information and demands for the government, and transmitting govern ment's policy support messages to solve the problems of the farmers. The other is some professional social organizations, such as edible fungi association, mushroom research association, export agricultural products enterprise association ), mainly responsible for safeguarding the interests of mushroom people, managing the industry order and supervising the production specifications and other responsibilities (Figure 69) . Figure 69 Congress of Qingyuan edible fungi association GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 102 5 Landscape Features 5.1 Landscape Created by the Unique Geographical Environment and Production Methods High mountains and dense forests are widely distributed in the site, and mushroom cultivation is the main means of livelihood for local people. The unique geographical environment and the corresponding production methods together formed a unique landscape of forests around the villages, rare croplands, dense streams, mushroom cultivation under forest or surrounding villages. The site is located in Donggong Mountain Rang e of Fujian -Zhejiang hilly area along the southeastern coast of China, with lots of precipitous mountains, deep valleys and steep slopes. Its average altitude is approximately 1000 m and slopes of most mountains are above 30 \u00b0 (Figure 70). The site belong s to the middle subtropical zone and has a warm and humid monsoon climate, with abundant rainfall, no severe cold in winter, no extreme heat in summer, many streams in mountains, rich water and fertilizer in soil. And it is also located in one of the regio ns with the most abundant fungus resources in the world. Benefiting from the superior climate, soil and other geographical environment, the site is rich in subtropical evergreen broad -leaved forests and fungus resources. Moreover, due to the closed environ ment and unfavorable reclamation caused by high mountains, the local forests are still well preserved even under the continuous enhancement of human activities, which provides unique natural conditions for this heritage system. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 103 Figure 70 Topographic maps of the site (a) DEM; (b) Slope GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 104 The steep mountains lead to the lack of arable land, which restricts the development of traditional agriculture, but promote the local villagers to go to the forests for mushroom cultivation objectively. Local people bui ld villages near the forests and rivers, cultivated mushrooms in the forests or beside the villages. Thus, the landscape patterns of fields in forests and villages in fields was gradually formed, which has the macro characteristics of \" 90% of the area is c overed with mountains, 5% with water and 5% with field \" (Figure 71). Meanwhile, local people pay attention to the protection of forest resources while cultivating mushrooms, which makes the landscape pattern of the site basically unchanged for thousands of years. Figure 71 Typical landscape of the site - Longyan Village (Upper left: high -resolution satellite image; upper right: of the village; lower left: forest vision; lower right: forest ecological landscape). This village is the hometown of Wu Sangong. Therefore, it is called the first village of Chinese mushroom culture, which has a history of more than 1000 years. More than 95% of the households in the village are surnamed Wu, and they have been producing mushrooms for generations. 5.2 Landscape Type and Distribution The total land area of the site is 14 ,117.43 ha. Forest is the dominant landscape type of the site , including mushroom forest such as Liquidambar formosana , Quercus and Castanea henryi , other broadleaf forest, coniferous forest, coniferous and broadleaf mixed forest and bamboo forest . There are other vegetation landscape types, such as shrubland, pasture , paddy field, dryland, orchard, vegetable garden and tea garden. Non-vegetat ed landscape types of the proposed site include residential land, barren land, GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 105 road, infrastructure and water body (Figure 72). Figure 72 Land use map of the site in 2018. Forest is the dominant landscape type. The area of forest is 13049.67 ha accounting for 92.44% of the total area of the proposed site . It include s natural broad -leaved forest suitable for Duohua method GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 106 cultivation such as Quercus , Castanea henryi and 0.21% (27.35 ha) and 0.12% (15.33 respectively; planted Castanea (158.27 ha) and 0.70% (91.42 ha) of the forests area, respectively; other broad -leaved forest, coniferous forest, conif erous and broad -leaved mixed forest and bamboo forest for 13.08% (1707.00 27.34% (3567.49 ha), 9.28% (1210.68 ha) and ha), respectively. The area of paddy field, dryland, shrubland and pasture ha (0.90%), respectively, which mainly distribute in the eastern and western parts of the site. The total area of orchard, vegetable and tea garden is 73.68 ha (0.52%). The area of residential land, water body and road, barren land and infrastructure are 47.26 ha (0.33%), 64.73 ha (0.46%) and 18.43 ha (0.13%), respectively, mostly scattering in the valleys of the site (Figure 73, Table 16, Table 17).

GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 109 (1) F orest The zonal vegetation of the site is evergreen broad -leaved forest, and there are also evergreen coniferous forest, mixed coniferous broad -leaved forest and bamboo forest, etc. (Figure 74). Most of the forests are evergreen all the year round, with rich spe cies and complex flora in the community. They are mainly composed of tree species such as Fagaceae , Theaceae , Cyclobalanopsis multinervis . Figure 74 Evergreen broad -leaved forest is the zonal vegetation, evergreen coniferous forest, mixed coniferous broad -leaved forest and bamboo forest are also widely distributed here. There have been preserved 4210.15 ha natural forests in the site, accounting for 32.26% of the total forest area, which are mainly ecological forests. A large number of natural secondary forests have been preserved in Baishanzu Nature Reserve and other places, including rare and well -preserved mid -subtropical natural vegetation in subtropical areas of China. Artificial forests actively planted by local residents account for 67.74% of the total forest area of the site, including mush room forests, fruit forests, timber forests, and so on. The forests in the site present significant vertical distribution differences along altitudes, especially in the Baishanzu Nature Reserve in the northwest of the site. Its complete vegetation vertical zonality represents the essence of the forest landscape in the site. The relative height difference between the southern and northern slope of the Baishanzu Mountain is more than 1300 m. Due to the obvious vertical Evergreen broad -leaved forest Evergreen coniferous forest Coniferous and broad -leaved mixed fores t Bamboo forest GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 110 gradient with the combination of water a nd heat factors at different altitudes of the mountain, there have six vegetation zones with different community appearance characteristics successively distributed from mountain foot to mountain top, including evergreen broad -leaved forest zone, evergreen and deciduous broad -leaved mixed forest zone, coniferous and broad -leaved mixed forest zone, coniferous forest zone, mountain coppice zone and mountain shrub -grass zone (Figure 75). Among them, mushroom cultivation is mainly concentrated in the area where the evergreen broad - leaved forest and mixed forest are located, mostly below 1500 m. Figure 75 Forests in the site present significant vertical distribution differences along altitudes, especially in the Baishanzu Nature Reserve. Evergreen broad -leaved forests are mainly distributed in the middle mountain area of the site, with an altitude between 800 m and 1500 m, including three formations of Castanopsis eyrei forest, Cyclobalanopsis glauca forest and secondary evergreen forest, with sparse shrubs and herbs in understory layer. Evergreen and deciduous broad -leaved mixed forests, with an altitude between 1200 m and 1650 m, include three formations of Fagus lucida - evergreen broad -leaved mixed forest, Cyclobalanopsis oad-leaved mixed forest, Lithocarpus brevicaudatus - deciduous broad -leaved mixed forest. With the increase of altitude, forests gradually transited to the deciduous forests. Coniferous and broad -leaved mixed forests, with an altitude of about 1500 m, incl ude six formations of Pinus taiwanensis - broad -leaved mixed forest, Abies beshanzuensis - broad -leaved mixed forest, Cryptomeria fortune - broad -leaved mixed forest, Fokienia hodginsii - broad -leaved mixed forest, Cunninghamia - broad -leaved mixed forest, Pinus massoniana - broad -leaved mixed forest. Both of coniferous trees and GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 111 broadleaf trees account for more than 30% of its composition. Coniferous forests, with an altitude between 1100 m and 1700 m, include four formations o f Pinus massoniana forest, Pinus taiwanensis forest, Cryptomeria fortunei forest and artificial coniferous forest. The appearance of the forest community remains dense green throughout the year. Mountain coppices, with an altitude between 1500 m and 1750 m , include four formations coppice. Mountain shrub -grass, with an altitude of above 1700 m, mainly composed of shrubs and herbs, including four formations of Stranvaesia davidiana shrub, Lespedeza bicolor shrub, Yushania baishanzuensis shrub and Sasa qingyuanensis shrub. The mushroom forests used for mushroom cultivation are mostly evergreen broad - leaved trees, mainly (2) Gushan Gumin usually take log of tree species such as Quercus , Castanea henryi and Liquidambar formosana in natural forests to cultivate mushrooms with traditional Duohua method. These tree species suitable for Duohua method are widely distributed in the broad -leaved forests, coniferous and broad -leaved mixed forests in the proposed site. According to the forest resources survey in Qingyuan County, the area of forests domi nated by , Castanea is 2,026.97 ha, accounting for 15.53% of total forest area in the proposed site. All of these forests could be used to cultivate mushrooms with Duohua method theoretically. At present, th ere are 135 Gushan in the proposed site which are clearly recorded to produce mushroom with the Duohua method cultivation (Table 1 8). They are mainly concentrated in Bandaihou Village in the south of the site and Longyan Village in the north of the site. According to the forest resources survey data of Qingyuan County, the total area of these Gushan is 813.56 ha, accounting for 40.14% and 6.23% of the natural mushroom forest s and total forests, respectively (Figure 76). There have broad -leaved forests and coniferous and broad -leaved in the heritage site. Not only it is the place where Gumin once produced mushroom by Duohua cultivation in history, but also the core area for protecting and inheriting Duohua cultivation in the GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 112 future. Gumin take 5 -7 years as a production cycle in one place and then move to another place so that the forest at th e production site can resume growth. In the course of several years of production, Gumin will build temporary residence, thus leaving some abandoned Gumin 's shack in the heritage site. Figure 76 Distribution of traditional Duohua method cultivation sites in the site. Duohua method m ushroom cultivation mostly uses natural evergreen broadleaf trees, mainly including Quercus, Castanea henryi and Liquidambar formosana .

Villages are hidden in high mountains and dense forests. They are not only the living places for local residents, but al so the sites for the mushroom cultivation. These villages have a long history, among which Longyan, Huangpi and Zhailang villages are the most representative. Longyan Village is known as \"the First Village of Chinese Mushroom Culture\". It is the hometown o f Wu Sangong, which has a history of more than 1000 years. More than 90% of the farmers in the village live on mushroom cultivation for generations. Lots of relics related to Wu Sangong are preserved in the village, such as Wu Sangong Ancestral Temple, Wu Sangong's Former Residence and Wu Sangong Cemetery. Huangpi Village is a typical historical and cultural ancient village in the site. The village has preserved rich cultural relics, such as Ancestral Temple of Wu Family , Xinfenlin inscriptions on precipices, etc. In Ancestral Temple of Wu Family , ancient building constructions such as shrines, windows and brackets carved by exquisite carving skills are well preserved, which have important architectural research value. Zhailang Village was built in the Jiayou period of Song Dynasty (1056 A.D. -1063 A.D.). There have more than a dozen well -preserved ancient dwellings of southern Zhejiang style, two temples, one ancient Langqiao , and more than 20 ancient Cryptomeria fortunei trees that over 300 years old in this village (Figure 77). (4) Terrace More than 95% of the site are mountainous areas. In order to maximize the use of land and food production to meet the basic living needs of villagers, local residents GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 114 build terraces on gentle slopes along the hillside contours between forests and villages, which are used to grow crops such as grain and vegetables, forming a unique terrace landscape (Figure 78, Figure 79). Terraces surround the villages and are adjacent to dense forests, which not only improves the arable land area in mountainous areas, but also has the function of soil and water conservation. Huangpi Village Zhailang Village Longyan Village Figure 77 Villages mainly located at the flat area near the river valley in the proposed site, among which Huangpi Village, Zhailang Village and Longyan Village are traditional and representative. Mushroom sheds for modern mushroom cultivation are usually distributed around villages. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 115 Figure 78 Most croplands are terraces in the proposed site. Terraces are mainly distributed in the eastern and western mountainous areas. They not only increase the arable area, but also conducive to the conservation of soil and water. Paddy rice planted in terraces Vegetable planted in terraces Figure 79 Terrace landscape in the site. The main crops are paddy rice and vegetables. (5) River Hundreds of streams are densely distributed in the site with a radial pattern, which belongs to Oujiang River System, Minjiang River System and Fu'an River System. The southwestern slope of Baishanzu Mountain is the birthplace of Songyuan River, a GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 116 tributary of Minjiang River. The northeastern slope is the birthplace of the mainstream of the Oujiang River, and the southeastern slope is the source of Fu'an River, which is known as the \"Source of Three Rivers\" (Figure 80). Figure 80 Distribution of water system in the site. The site is known as the \"Source of Three Rivers\". Oujiang River , Minjiang R and Fu'an River tributary are originated from Baishanzu Mountain. Streams flow in the high mountains and dense forests. Some of them surround the villages, and provide rich water resources for mushroom cultivation and villagers' production and life. Some of them converge into alpine wetlands, such as Huangpi Wetland with vast area, stone dragon wonder and strangely -shaped pines, adding beautiful scenery to the site. Some of them form unique waterscapes. For example, there are a large number of green pools, shoals, springs and waterfalls distributed in Jinzifeng forest par k.

Villages are generally built along the river valleys near water sources, with an average altitude of 959.01 m and a slope of 8.93\u00b0 (Table 19). Terraces located in the areas between the villages and mountainside with relatively gentle slope, with an average altitude of 1086.12 m and a slope of 13.75\u00b0 . Forests are distributed in the areas with steep slopes. The average altitude is 1150.04 m, with the highest being up to 1854.0 m, and the a verage slope is 23.19\u00b0 .

Forests provide raw material for mushroom cultivation and play an important ecosystem services. Terra ces guarantee the food supply of local residents such as grains and vegetables. Villages provide living places for residents and processing places for agricultural and forestry products. The rivers meet the demand for production and living water, providing aquatic products for local residents and serving as a transportation channel in history.

The traditional Duohua method is inseparable from the forests, so the cultivation sites are scattered in the forests. The invention of wood log and substitute material methods expanded the mushroom cultivations from deep mountains to the flat areas around the villages, thus for ming an intensive mushroom cultivation landscape. Wood log cultivation is mostly located in the forests at the edge of the villages, which is convenient for artificial management and shading. It is more common in the north and central part of the site, esp ecially in Longyan and Qiaomo villages. Substitute material cultivation often produces mushroom intensively in the mushroom sheds around the villages, which is distributed in all village of the site (Figure 83). Figure 83 Landscape of mushroom cultivatio n in the site. Duohua cultivation sites scatter in mountain forests, wood log cultivation sites are located in the edges of forests near villages, and substitute material cultivation sites are located in mushroom sheds in villages. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 120 5.4 Change of Forest Landscape Landsat images show that the forest area of the site has increased steadily in recent decades, and the landscape structure is generally stable. From 1976 to 2018, the forest coverage rate increased from 88.33% to 92.44% (Figure 84, Figure 85). Figure 84 Forest landscape change in the site . Satellite imag es of Landsat indicate that the forests area of the site increased gradually from 1976 to 2018 . GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 121 Figure 85 Forest cover rate change in the site (1976 -2018). From 1976 to 2018, forest coverage rate of the site increased from 87.08% to 89.69%. Because of the rapid development of mushroom industry around 1980s, the forest cover rate has a slight decline in 1980. Since the 1970s, the mushroom industry in Qingyuan County has developed rapidly with t he popularization of strain inoculation technique, and the corresponding consumption of forest resources has also increased. After 2010, the expansion of cities and towns led to a slight reduction of forest area in the eastern and northern of the site. How ever, the total forest area in Qingyuan County has not decreased but shows a general stable trend. This is mainly due to the long -term adherence of local residents to the thought of forest and mushroom co -culture, the continuous progress of mushroom cultiv ation techniques, and the continuous improvement of use pattern of forest resources. It is also related to the local special alpine environment and low population density, which makes less human interference. In addition, vigorous implementation of forest protection policies also makes great contribution. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 122 V. Action Plans for the Proposed GIAHS Site 1 Threats, Challenges, Potentials and Opportunities 1.1 Threats and Challenges (1) Rapid development of society brings great impact on traditional culture With the rapid development of urbanization and industrialization in recent years, l ots of farmers leave villages for cities, which cause massive reduction of the number of farmers, especially young and middle -aged farmers. The traditional culture accordingly has lost its intergeneration inheritance carrier, and is gradually declining and falling. Traditional cultures of QFMCS , such as forest ecological cultures, folk beliefs and customs, folklore art, catering culture, traditional farm tools, cultural relics, local rules and regulations and social organizations, has been impacted by the t ide of the times, undergoing unprecedented changes. Young people are fonder of fashion culture, instead of Gumin Opera , Xianggu Kungku , Xianggu folk song worshipping Shanshen Yinshu , etc. is gradually weaken ed. Due to the continuous development of mushroom cultivation techniques, traditional customs such as Guodan , taking a Guyu bath, having farewell dinner , keeping a Gushan dog, etc. are endangere d. (2) Labor loss restricts the effective inheritance of traditional techniques QFMCS achieve s the coordinated development of forest resource conservation and mushroom cultivation through a variety of traditional techniques, but the traditional agricultural production requires a long time, high work intensity, and lots of labors . According to the survey and statistics, 1,059 people were engaged in the agricultural production of forestry and mushroom in the site in 201 9, accounting for only 21.1% of the total registered population; among them, the number of employees aged 16 -40, 41 - 50, 51 -60 and over 60 were 166, 225, 363 and 305 respectively, accounting for 15.7%, 21.2%, 34.3% and 28.8% respectively (Table 20). It can be seen that, at present, a small number of people are still engaged in agricultural production, and it is mainly the middle -aged and elderly people over 50 years old (accounting for 63.1%). The mushroom industry will be trapped in a severe condition for its sustainable development as those farmers are growing older. Taking Duohua cultivation technique as an example, in the past 20 years, only a few farmers still used the traditional method. With the continuous outflow of young and middle -aged labor force and the continuous progress of modern agricultural production techniques, it is hard for most of young people to learn and inherit such method due to few opportunities of learning and GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 123 practice s. Without protection and inheritance , the traditional techniques contained in QFMCS will be lost and gradually become a historical memory. Table 20 Age distribution of the labor force in the site in 201 9 Town ship Number of people /person Number of people engaged in forest and mushroom industry /person Age distribution of the labor force 16~40 years old /person 41~50 years old /person 74 101 150 Wudabao 1587 493 84 109 157 143 Songyuan 394 45 8 15 10 12 Total 5022 1059 166 225 363 305 Note: The township statistics in the table is only about the administrative villages located within the site. (3) Insufficient investment affects the protection of historical and cultural landscape Traditional villages are an essential part of the cultural landscape in the site . Ancient villages with a history of nearly one thousand years, such as Longyan, Huangpi and Zhailang villages, are located in the site , and a large number of cultura l relics and historic sites, ancient houses and ancient buildings are preserved in the villages ( Figure 86). With the acceleration of urbanization, many villages are demolished, or newly built or rebuilt disorderly, or emptied out, desolated and withered . Traditional villages gradually lose their original style and features. At present, incense offerings can still be seen in the well -preserved Gushen temple. The Wu Sangong Memorial Hall has been repair ed and reconstruct ed with funds from the government. So me ancient dwellings have also been actively repaired in the site, but there are still many dwellings that have not been well protected and maintained. Qingyuan County has implemented the landscape reconstruction plan to save the old houses and ancient villages. However, due to insufficient protection funds, the focus of reconstruction is only put on the national traditional ancient villages with more rich history and cultures at present. Most of the ancient villages in the site has not drawn extensive attention , and m any landscapes bearing mushroom cultures have been out of repair for a long time. The traditional ancient villages and architectural landscapes are scattered in the countryside and unmanaged. The local buildings are mostly of wooden struct ures, which are more prone to decay and burn. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 124 Figure 86 There have many ancient dwelling in the site. Some ancient dwellings have been actively repaired, but there are still many dwellings that have not been well protected. (4) Brand effect of heritage protection has not showed up The southwest, northwest and other regions of China have taken the advantage of their rich forest resources and low -cost labor force, and implemented the \"short, flat, and fast\" project, to accelerate the development of mushroom industry , thus resulting in much more fierce market competition against Qingyuan mushroom industry. At the same time, as the residents' consumption demand keeps increasing and various trade barriers are set up, the mushroom industry and market of Qingyuan County are facing unprecedented challenges for sustainable development. Currently, some brands of Qingyuan mushroom have been awarded, such as the \"Township of China's Mushroom \", \"Products under National Origin Area Protection \", \"China's Importan t Agricultural Heritage System \" and \"Famous Trademark of China \". Such various brands have improved influence and popularity of Qingyuan mushroom on the one hand; but on the other hand, it is difficult to effectively promote each brand due to limited market ing costs, leading to a waste of resource. Furthermore , in the site , many agricultural products and processed products with local characteristics are still produced and sold by farmers themselves, and have not yet been industrialized . Viewed from many heri tage sites, certification on important agricultural heritage system has merely created a gold name plate. Lack of systematic recognition of agriculture heritage system results in insufficient promotion and utilization of its brand. This is also the case for the site herein. Overall, brand promotion is not enough, and work hasn't been carried GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 125 out to manage heritage logo and to certify ecological products in the site. 1.2 Potentials and Opportunities (1) Improvement of agricultural quality and efficiency needs to learn from traditional agricultural wisdom The site located in the relatively backward mountainous area of southwest Zhejiang Province, and the comparative benefit of agriculture is low. Development of characteristic and high -quality agriculture can help farmers to improve income. The site has obvious advantages in characteristic agricultural and forestry products, ecological and environmental resources, natural and human landscapes, traditional cultures, local cuisine and other resources and it is very suitable to develop characteristic and high- quality agricultural production. In addition, it is of enormous potential to develop emerging industries such as eco-tourism, creative agriculture, agricultural culture industry, agricultural education indu stry based on the QFMCS. Exploring the scientific connotation of QFMCS and advocating the development mode of ecological circular agriculture will help to reduce environmental pollution in the site and ensure the quality safety of agricultural products. At the same time, the protection of traditional cultivation techniques and local varieties is conducive to adhering to the objectives of superior quality, characteristic and localization of fine seed selecting and breeding, overcoming the tendency of single breeding in excessive pursuit of yield orientation, forming agricultural production and quality advantage of agricultural products with significant local characteristics, and promoting the realization of the green development goals of green agriculture, gr een products and green villages in the site. Though the site is endowed with rich resources, many of them have not been developed and utilized at present . Therefore, the protectors of the heritage do not get the due benefits and the enthusiasm of protectio n is not high. The heritage conservation and utilization measures, such as strengthening the construction of product brands, implementing the talent training project, and improving the infrastructure of the site and others, will help to make full use of th ese resources, vigorously promote the quality and efficiency of agriculture and the integrated development of primary, secondary and tertiary industries, and realize the value increment of heritage resources in the site. (2) Value realization of ecological product promotes development of related industries As the birthplace of \"Two -Mountain Theory\", Lishui City of Zhejiang Province has been committed to practice and exploration in realizing the value of ecological products, and actively promoting the transf ormation of \"green hills and clear waters\" into \"prosperity and wealth\". Benefiting from the superior ecological environment of the GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 126 site, agricultural and forestry products such as mushroom, fruits and vegetables, and grains have unique ecological advantag es, providing a good foundation for the exploration of the value realization mechanism of ecological products. Qingyuan County of Lishui City has successively won the titles of \"The Mushroom City of China\", \"Summer Resort in China\" and \"China's Most Beauti ful Eco -tourism Demonstration Count y\", which are completely consistent with the value realization mechanism of ecological products in development concept . In the future, through the pilot work of the national ecological product value realization mechanism to further explore the effective path of the transformation of the ecological value of the special agricultural products in the site, the development of related industries can be promoted and the sustainable development ability of QFMCS can also be enhance d. (3) Awareness of farming culture protection in the site has been continuously enhanced Owing to the recognition and respect for traditional culture, traditional ideological and value system in China, the protection and development of QFMCS has drawn wide attention and support from all sectors of society . To protect the traditional culture, under the unified deployment of Qingyuan County Government, the departments of agriculture, forestry, culture, radio, film, television and other departments carried out a comprehensive investigation of traditional techniq ues, and established China Qingyuan Xianggu Museu m, an only museum combining professional and comprehensive natures to exhibit mushroom culture ( Figure 87). To protect the traditional techniques , the county issued relevant policies to encourage farmers to appropriately carry out cultivation with Duohua method, and also built a cultivation demonstration base of Duohua method in Huilongwan with a total area of 1216 mu to carry out protection and inheritance . To protect the endangered and rare plants such as Abies beshanzuensis and maintain the regional biodiversity, Baishanzu National Nature Reserve was established . In the meanwhile, the eco -tourism industry was actively developed and one-day or two - day tours of mushroom culture scenic spots were opened . There fore, mushroom culture , Jingning ethnic minority custom, Longquan sword porcelain culture complement each other, forming a unique folk culture circle in southwest Zhejiang. GIAHS Proposal Qingyuan Forest -Mushroom Co -culture System in Zhejiang Province 127 Figure 87 China Qingyuan Xianggu museum , an only museum combining professional and comprehensive natures to exhibit mushroom culture . 2 Proposed Actions To deal with these threats, challenges, potentials and opportunities, 36 actions have been planned, including 5 comprehensive actions, 5 ecological conservation actions , 5 cultural inheritance actions, 6 eco -agricultural product development actions, 6 sustainable tourism development actions and 7 capability building actions.
