To achieve such diverse genetic engineering, two main repair pathways of DNA DSBs have been commonly used ( Fig. 1). Gene knockouts and chromosomal rearrangements often use non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is an error-prone repair pathway that does not require a repair template2-4. NHEJ can join the DNA ends generated by programmable nucleases with or without small insertions and deletions, which can cause a frameshift in an open reading frame. In addition, widely separated DNA ends can be joined by NHEJ, resulting in large deletions, inversions, duplica - tions or translocations. NHEJ can occur throughout the cell cycle, whereas the activity of other repair pathways is limited to specific phases5. For gene knock-ins, HR has mainly been used. HR is a precise repair pathway, which is active during the late S/G2 phases, and it requires a repair template that harbors a long homologous sequence corresponding to the genomic DNA around the DSB site. The sister chromatid usually serves as the repair template for HR, but an exogenous targeting vector can also be used for the template, enabling gene knock-in. Although HR-mediated gene knock-in has been reported in several cells and organisms, such as human pluripotent stem cells6,7 and mice8, there remains room for advancements in gene knock-in strategies, especially in terms of promoting their efficiency and widening their applicability to various cells and organisms, including animal embryos with a low HR frequency. The rapid and widespread development of genome editing methods has uncovered the substantial contribution of an alter - native DSB repair pathway, MMEJ, to gene knockout by program - mable nucleases ( Fig. 1). When short microhomologies exist, both upstream and downstream of the DSB site, the two microhomologies can be annealed by MMEJ, often resulting in short deletions of the intervening sequence. MMEJ is known to be active during M-early S phases, which is when HR is inactive5. Efficiencies of NHEJ, HR and MMEJ in repairing DSBs are different between cell types and organisms, but many previous studies have reported frequent traces of MMEJ repair in the base-deleted alleles induced by simple expression of programmable nucleases9-13, suggesting the superiority of this pathway in repairing DSBs generated by programmable nucleases. Particularly, Bae et al.14 found that the frequencies of microhomology-associated deletions 44.3% and 52.7% for transcription short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9, respectively. Li et al.15 also showed that more than 30% of the deletion alleles were joined by 3- to 5-bp microhomolo - gies. Despite this, however, there had been no reports of the use of MMEJ for gene knock-in until we developed such systems. Development of the PITCh systems To use the MMEJ pathway for gene knock-in, we developed a novel knock-in system, which we named the PITCh system16. To date, HR- or NHEJ-mediated methods tend to have been adopted for the generation of gene knock-in ( Fig. 2a Ken-Ichi T Suzuki & Takashi Y amamoto Department of Mathematical and Life Sciences, Graduate School of Science, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan. Correspondence should be addressed to T.S. ( tetsushi-sakuma@hiroshima-u.ac.jp ). Published online 17 December 2015; 0 programmable nucleases enable engineering of the genome by utilizing endogenous D na double-strand break (D sB) repair pathways. although homologous recombination (H r)-mediated gene knock-in is well established, it cannot necessarily be applied in every cell type and organism because of variable H r frequencies. We recently reported an alternative method of gene knock-in, named the pItch (precise Integration into target chromosome) system, assisted by microhomology-mediated end-joining (MM eJ). MMeJ harnesses independent machinery from H r, and it requires an extremely short homologous sequence (5-25 bp) for D sB repair, resulting in precise gene knock-in with a more easily constructed donor vector. Here we describe a streamlined protocol for pItch knock-in, including the design and construction of the pItch vectors, and their delivery to either human cell lines by transfection or to frog embryos by microinjection. the construction of the pItch vectors requires only a few days, and the entire process takes ~1.5 months to establish knocked-in cells or ~1 week from injection to early genotyping in frog embryos.

In contrast, the PITCh sys - tem generates DSBs in the donor vector (PITCh vector) and the genomic DNA using programmable nucleases; the donor sequence (either the whole plasmid or a specific gene cassette, depending on the experimental design) is then inserted into the genome by MMEJ, and it is stimulated by microhomologous DNA ends on the PITCh vector generated by the programmable nucleases ( Fig. 2 c). PITCh systems harness very short (5-25 bp) microhomolo - gous sequences as homology arms, which are easily added to the PITCh vector by PCR or by the insertion of annealed oligonucleotides. The addition of microhomologies is more con - venient than construction of a targeting vector for HR-mediated genome engineering, which contains long (500-1,000 bp) homology arms. In addition, sticky ends produced by dimeric FokI-fused nucleases such as zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs for MMEJ-mediated gene unlike the NHEJ-mediated methods17,1 8. Development of TAL-PITCh. TALEN-mediated PITCh (TAL- PITCh) uses a spacer sequence between the left and right TALEN target sites as the microhomologies ( Fig. 3). The left half of the spacer sequence should be a microhomology for the 5 junction of the genomic target site, and the right half should be a micro - homology for the 3 junction. To generate corresponding micro - homologies at the DNA ends of the exogenous DNA donor, the microhomologies comprising the spacer sequence of the TALEN target site on the TAL-PITCh vector is switched compared with the genomic target; i.e., the 5 junction microhomology is on the right and the 3 junction microhomology is on the left. As the optimal length of the spacer sequence is generally ~15 bp (refs. 19,20), the lengths of the 5 and 3 microhomologies are typically set to ~8 bp. After precise integration into the genome, two TALEN target sites remain in the 5 and 3 junctions, but they are no longer cut by TALENs because of the shortened spacer sequence.Development of CRIS-PITCh. In our original report of CRISPR- Cas9-mediated PITCh (CRIS-PITCh)16, two or three different gene-specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) were required to generate microhomologies in the close vicinity of the Cas9 cleavage sites, depending on the experimental design: one targeting the genomic site and two targeting the 5 and 3 ends of the donor sequence in the PITCh vector ( Fig. 4 a). We have since updated the CRIS- PITCh system (CRIS-PITCh (v2)) to replace the gene-specific gRNAs targeting the PITCh vector with generic gRNAs (PITCh- gRNA)21. This was achieved by introducing generic PITCh-gRNA target sites upstream and downstream of the 5 and 3 micro - homologies, respectively, and the lengths of the microhomolo - gies were set to 20 bp ( Fig. 4 b). CRIS-PITCh (v2) is the focus of this protocol. To date, we have only published CRIS-PITCh (v2) data for whole plasmid integration in mammalian cultured cells, and PITCh-gRNA was designed to maximally eliminate off-target cleavages in various mammalian genomes, on the basis of the scores calculated by the CRISPR design tool ( http://crispr.mi t. edu/; Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Owing to design differ - ences, requires distal original CRIS-PITCh requires proximal MMEJ, with the MMEJ machinery trimming the extra bases outside the two microhomologies during the repair process. According to a recent report, the frequency of occurrence of distal MMEJ is higher than that of proximal MMEJ22, which suggests that the modified system has increased efficiency . Interestingly, proximal and distal MMEJ systems have several mechanistic differences. For example, the ability to perform end resection does not affect the frequency of proximal MMEJ, whereas distal MMEJ is abol - ished in cells that lack resection-promoting proteins23. A further understanding of these two MMEJ systems might contribute to future improvements of the PITCh systems. Overview of the procedure In this protocol, we describe a procedure for CRIS-PITCh (v2)- mediated knock-in of the EGFP-2A-Puro cDNA cassette into any desirable gene locus in HEK293T cells. The entire workflow for PITCh-mediated gene knock-in in cultured cells is presented in Figure 5. In addition, a procedure for applying the TAL-PITCh system in Xenopus laevis embryos is described ( Box 1 and Fig. 6). The CRIS-PITCh (v2) procedure is divided into three main stages: vector construction, cell culture and analysis.

These vectors are then co-transfected into cultured cells (Steps 26-29) and appropriate drug selection is performed (Steps 30 and 31). Successful gene knock-in can be confirmed at this stage by population analyses of PCR geno - typing (Steps 32-42) and/or fluorescence observation (Steps 43-45). Subsequently, single-cell cloning followed by genotyping performed Alternative targeted knock-in methods HR-dependent insertion of exogenous donor DNA is a major strategy for gene knock-in. When programmable nucleases induce a DSB, the frequency of donor incorporation increases compared with the occurrence of spontaneous HR-mediated con - ventional gene targeting24. This strategy has been well established and applied in various cells and organisms1, but the efficiency of gene knock-in is not always sufficient, because of the limited availability of the HR pathway17,2 5. In addition, construction of a targeting vector containing the left and right homology arms is time-consuming and laborious. Cloning-free single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) has also been used as the repair template instead of a double-stranded DNA donor26-2 8. This is quite useful for small gene modifications, such as incorporating a single-nucleotide polymorphism or integrating a small tag (<100 bp), but it cannot be applied for inserting long gene cassettes. Alternatively, exogenous DNA can be incoporated using the NHEJ pathway17,29,3 0. However, this strategy has a tendency to induce mutagenic junctions caused by erroneous NHEJ. Obligate ligation-gated recombination (ObLiGaRe), which was developed by Maresca et al.18, can incorporate the donor plasmid with high accuracy; however, this requires sticky-end ligation, and it cannot be adapted to the conventional CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease approach. Furthermore, the ObLiGaRe method has only been reported for whole plasmid integration in cultured cells, and the wider applicability is still unknown. Advantages, limitations and applications of the PITCh systems Compared with alternative targeted knock-in methods, the PITCh- ing strategy enables easy and versatile gene knock-in in various cells and animals with high efficiency ( T able 1), with reliable junc - tions, and without any amplification of the genomic sequence for donor construction. The PITCh system has been proven to work well in both cultured cells and animals, including invertebrates and vertebrates16,21. On the basis of direct comparisons at a single genomic locus, the knock-in efficiency of TAL-PITCh is ~2.5-fold higher the efficiency of HR-assisted gene knock-in in HeLa cells16. The protocols for TAL-PITCh and CRIS-PITCh provide a convenient and effective method of gene knock-in using programmable nucleases.Genome DN A MMEJGene-specifi A MME JGene-specifi c gRNA # 1 Last coding ex on PITCh vectorStopGene-specifi c gRNA # 3Microhomology ( 8 bp) Gene-specifi c gRNA # 2 Stop MME J Stop 3 gene-specific gRNAs ar e required Low accur acy of junctions because of short mic rohomologies ( ~ 1 gene-specific gRNA is required High accuracy of junctions because of relatively long microhomologies (~20 bp) Distal MMEJ with end trimmingFigure 4 | The original and modified CRIS-PITCh systems (v1 and v2) for cassette knock-in.

(continued)\u00a9 201 5Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.protocol 122 | VOL.11 NO.1 | 2016 | nature protocolsThe PITCh systems currently have some limitations, although future improvements may resolve these. In TAL-PITCh, the length of microhomology is restricted by the optimal range of the spacer sequence of the TALEN target site. In addition, TALEN sites remain at the 5 and 3 junctions after integration. These shortcomings could be overcome by using de novo -designed TALEN sites for the TAL-PITCh vector, similarly to the PITCh- gRNA sites in the CRIS-PITCh (v2) system. In both the original and the modified CRIS-PITCh, the requirement for a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)\u20145 the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9\u2014close to the genomic DSB site is potentially limiting. However, this problem can be mitigated by using either TALENs or a Cas9 from another species (with a different PAM) to induce genomic cleavage. The TAL-PITCh system has currently been applied in cultured cells, silkworms and frogs16. The original and modified CRIS- PITCh system has been applied in cultured cells and zebrafish16,21. Although further work is needed to clarify the exact applicability of PITCh systems in other organisms, it is expected that they will be applicable to a wide range of species, because of the advantageous properties of the MMEJ pathway. First, the MMEJ pathway is active during most periods of the cell cycle, whereas the activity of the HR pathway is restricted to the late S/G2 phases5. Second, traces of MMEJ repair are often observed in various animal species including rats9, mice11,1 2, Drosophila10 and Trypanosoma13, using programmable nucleases. Thus, the PITCh systems are expected to be versatile methods for easy and efficient gene knock-in. There are many potential applications of the PITCh systems, including the creation of reporter cell or animal lines, modeling of human diseases and the production of recombinant pharmaceutical proteins. Experimental design TALEN constructs for TAL-PITCh. For TAL-PITCh, a TALEN vector should be constructed only for the genomic target site. TALEN construction kits can be obtained from Addgene ( https:// www.addgene .org/TALEN /). We recommend using Platinum Box 1 | (Continued) 8. De-jelly the fertilized eggs .

For the original CRIS-PITCh, two or three gRNAs are required for whole plasmid integration and backbone-free cassette integration, respectively.

Activity validation of CRISPR-Cas9 vectors. Nuclease activity of TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9 vectors should be validated before use for gene knock-in. There are two main types of activity validation assays currently available: episomal reporter luciferase or been widely used20,35,3 6. A traffic-light reporter assay can also be performed38,3 9. In addition, there are many options to estimate the mutation rate, such as restriction frag - ment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis40,4 and high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA)43. Controls. As a positive control of transfection, first check the trans - fection efficiency using a simple fluorescent protein expression vector, such as GFP . As a negative control of PITCh knock-in, the TAL-PITCh or CRIS-PITCh vector should be transfected without TALEN or CRISPR-Cas9 vectors. If many puro - mycin-resistant colonies are observed in the absence of program - mable nuclease vectors, it is an indication that random integration occurs very frequently. If random integration cannot be avoided by dose control of PITCh vectors, consider negative selection using the herpes virus thymidine kinase or diphthteria toxin genes. cultured cell application. Transfection and single-cell cloning methods can be adapted from any other standard protocol using program - mable nucleases published elsewhere33,44,4 5. In our protocol, the lipofection method using Lipofectamine LTX (Life Technologies) is used for transfection, and the limiting dilution method after puromycin selection is used for single-cell cloning. However, there will be circumstances when other transfection methods, such as electroporation or lipofection with other reagents, will be suit - able. FACS could be used for single-cell cloning instead of limiting dilution. The PITCh system does not require long-range PCR for genotyping, because the microhomology sequence is extremely short. Thus, PCR genotyping is much easier than for HR-medi - ated gene knock-in. mRNA synthesis, microinjection and genotyping for animal application. To produce knock-in animals using PITCh systems, microinjection into eggs is the most appropriate method. The quality of the TALEN or Cas9 mRNA and gRNA is crucial for successful and efficient knock-in. High-purity plasmids are also required to decrease the toxicity of DNA injection into eggs.

There are several factors that may affect the signal intensity of the fluorescent protein using the strategy illustrated in Figure 9 a. First, the amount of fluorescent gene expression is determined by the expression level of the corresponding endogenous promoter. Second, post-transcriptional regulation mediated by an endogenous 3 UTR can affect the expression level of the fluorescent protein, because the coding sequence alone is inserted just before the endogenous stop codon. We must also note that the openly available CRIS-PITCh (v2) vector, pCRIS-PITChv2-FBL, contains a conventional EGFP gene instead of the one encoding the ultra-bright mNeon - Green46 used in Figure 9, although we have also confirmed the functionality of this pCRIS-PITChv2-FBL vector. Screening against random integrants is also important. If the targeted gene is expressed at low levels, the background frequency of random integrants will increase. It has been reported that by using programmable nucleases with high activity combined with efficient delivery methods, selection-free gene knock-in can be performed. For example, HR-mediated gene knock-in without drug selection has been achieved using the iCRISPR strategy in human embryonic stem cells47. However, we have only achieved gene knock-in with the use of puromycin selection, and it therefore remains to be confirmed whether the PITCh system can be applied without selection markers.
