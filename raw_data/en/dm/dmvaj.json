Dr. Kyle McKamey with Down To Earth Chiropractic in Dowagiac wrote on the business's ABC57 has yet to hear back from the Van Buren-Cass District Health Department on if this is something they would accept, but in the Berrien County Health Department's release announcing the mandate for masks in K-12 schools Wednesday, they said medical exemptions can only come from someone with a DO or MD. Cass County does not have a mask mandate right now and they are not required in Dowagiac, Marcellus or Cassopolis school districts.
