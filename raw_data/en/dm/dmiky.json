At the same time, the intentions and gestures of the ceremony activate beneficial responses in the seen and unseen worlds\u2014the ceremony itself becomes sacred activism. This loving act of ceremony creates the opening to experience our unique human identity as caretakers of life on Mother Earth. Ceremonies with nature are the sacred seeds of healing and nourishment for Mother Earth and can help to bring balance where it is needed. Nature Gratitude Twice yearly, we organize and offer instruction for Nature Gratitude Ceremonies. Each time O.N.E. offers a ceremony to be shared by our global community we wait, listen, feel, and look at what is moving in commonality and what wants to be expressed in co-creation with nature. The weavings are exquisite, perfect and sometimes (often) unexpected. We invite you to join us by holding Gratitude Ceremony of your own, either in connection with larger O.N.E. community or anytime within your community of nature. Below are more detailed instructions and invitations for ceremony honoring Mother Earth and her many expressions.

Join from wherever you are and expand the power of this call to ceremony for Trees by sharing this with your family, friends and community Guidance For Your Own Ceremony Though a ceremony needs a form, and forms that are repeated over time gain power, you will find that a spirit of spontaneity and playfulness is also welcome. Maybe you will be moved to dance or drum or sing. The spirits of nature are fed by happiness and beauty! To see the illustrations more fully, click the images below. A place is dedicated for the \"ritual\" altar setting. This altar can be outdoors or inside, large or small. It may hold symbolic items that embody qualities or beings that we want to invoke in the ceremony -such as stones, plants, or feathers. Usually each of the seven directions are present as well as the elements of earth, air, fire and water. Since this ceremony is especially for water, a large bowl of water is placed on the altar. Flowers and a lit candle are traditional, evoking beauty, life and light. The participants become ready. This is a form of purification in which we become clear channels of blessing. Smudging is a traditional method. Some might use ablutions with water. A basic preparation is simply taking some long deep breaths to settle oneself and clear one's energy, setting a vibration of peace. Traditionally the seven directions and the spiritual forces associated with these are asked to be present and empower the action of the ceremony. Sometimes it is appropriate to ask forgiveness from the element we are honoring, expressing our remorse: along with our gratitude. From this place we can clearly state and internally feel our intention for right relationship or original wholeness with this element. For example, we may have acknowledged water pollution and now we send our love and intention for the health and purity of the waters to be restored. We perform a ritual action of giving back, in the case of a water ceremony we may pour water that has absorbed our love and the blessings of the ceremony into a brook, with the intention of its carrying a pattern of wholeness to the waters of the world (for practical reasons this may be done after the Closing) Or we may simply dedicate ourselves to an action on behalf of Earth healing. Sometimes this is done with a song or chant. It reinforces the communal nature of the ceremony (even if it seems you are working alone, in fact we are all part of a great community). Also, if we have called in spiritual helpers, at this time we acknowledging to them that we are closing the ceremony, with our thanks. "}
