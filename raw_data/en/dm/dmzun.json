As acknowledged by the Buddha, there is a certain amount of pain in life that is inevitable, but the suffering is typically much greater than the real pain, and this suffering is, therefore, largely unnecessary. We suffer as a reaction to life events, however this unskillful reaction could be controlled to minimize unnecessary suffering. You may be wondering how this can be controlled, and your answer is; mindfulness and meditation Meditation is a mind and body practice, which focuses on the interactions among the brain, mind, body and behavior. It has a long history of use for increasing calmness and relaxation, improve psychological balance, coping with illness and enhancing overall health and wellbeing. Although there are many different types of meditations, there are four common elements between each type. The first element is a quiet location with as few distractions as possible. Next, is a specific, comfortable posture, such as sitting, standing, or lying down. Third, is a focus of attention which can be assisted by repeating a mantra, holding or gazing at a physical object or focusing on breath. And lastly, an open attitude with the ability to let distractions come and go naturally without stopping to judge them. In 2017, a report based on data from the National Health Interview Survey found that \"U.S. adults' use of meditation in the past 12 months tripled between 2012 and 2017 (from 4.1 percent to 14.2 percent). The use of meditation by U.S. children (aged 4 to 17 years) also increased significantly (from 0.6 percent in 2012 to 5.4 percent in 2017).\" (NCCIH, 2019). The bottom line is that meditation can be performed by anyone, anywhere at anytime Although an exact date is unknown, scholars and archaeologists seem to agree that meditation has been around for about 5000 years. Some of the earliest documentations of meditation come from the teachings of the Vedas in ancient India. The Vedas are the most ancient Hindu scriptures and contain hymns, philosophy, and guidance of ritual for the priests of Vedic religion. Between 400-100 BCE, the yoga sutras of Patanjali were compiled, and this outlined the eight limbs of yoga, which is the sister science of Ayurveda. From 400 BCE to 200 CE, the bhagavad gita was written. It is an epic poem as well as scripture that discusses the philosophy of yoga, meditation and how to live a spiritual life. In 653 BCE the first meditation hall opened in Japan. Japanese Buddhism began to evolve in the 8th century. Many years later, in the 18th century, translations of the ancient teachings began to make their way to scholars in the West. Fast forward to present time, many people have incorporated wellness activities such as meditation and yoga into their everyday life. Aforementioned, the translations of ancient teachings of meditation began to make their way to the west in the 18th century. Until the late 1900's, mindfulness and meditation remained a fairly taboo topic, and still has many skeptics. However, in recent years, meditation has been a hot topic of conversation, gaining public interest and scientific attention. This has lead to more clinical studies and research into the benefits of meditation. One specific study conducted by Harvard researchers found that \"there are a handful of key areas, like depression, chronic pain, and anxiety where well-designed, well-run studies have exhibited benefits for patients that engage in a mindfulness meditation program, with effects similar to other existing treatments. (Harvard Medical School, 2016). Meditation is essentially training the brain, just as you would any other part of the body. However, there are many different types of meditations, and some that are more helpful for particular health benefits. At the very least, meditation will bring you to a state of relaxation. This response was coined the \"relaxation response\" by Herbert Benson, a researcher at the Harvard University Medical School in the 70s. In Benson's words, the relaxation response is \"an opposite, involuntary response that causes a reduction in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system.\" (Benson, 1975). Since Benson's discovery, the following are short term benefits of meditation to the nervous system; lower blood pressure, improved blood circulation, lower heart rate, less perspiration, slower respiratory rate, less anxiety, lower blood cortisol levels, more feelings of well-being, less stress, and deeper relaxation. Contemporary researchers are now exploring whether consistent meditation practice yields long-term benefits, and noting positive effects on brain and immune function among meditators. However, as an Eastern philosopher may suggest, there should be no goal of meditation or its benefits, but instead it is simply to be present in the current moment. Additionally, meditation and herbs soothe the nervous system and promote overall well being. I am going to explain 5 different herbs, their properties, and which type of meditation it could be best paired with. The first herb is Gotu Kola, which grows in some areas of the himalayas where yogis use it to improve meditation. It is believed to develop the crown chakra, and balance the right and left hemispheres of the brain. This herb has mild stimulating properties which can nourish and bring balance to the nervous system. Gotu Kola promotes normal levels of mental alertness and a sound memory. Because it helps activate mental alertness, Gotu Kola can be paired with a focused meditation, like mantra repetition. Next on the list is Hawthorn, which has a long history of bringing comfort to a grieving heart because it can help you connect to the energy of your heart. The leaves and berries have been traditionally used by many cultures as a heart tonic, and modern research also demonstrates that hawthorn strengthens the heart muscle. Used in conjunction with meditation, this herb can help ease you into the moment and accept whatever emotion or thought that comes up, with compassion. Because of all of its heart friendly benefits, a loving kindness meditation can be done in just a few minutes and can help create and nurture self-love and compassion in your life. The third herb to improve meditation is Nettles. You may have had a prior experience with this one from a walk through a trail or meadow, and ending up with a small rash from stinging nettles. Despite its sting, Nettle has a very high nutritional content and has a long history of supporting upper respiratory health, healthy prostate function, and a healthy immune response to allergens. Nettle helps bring our awareness to the things in life that are uncomfortable. When combined with meditation this herb can bring awareness to the difficult moments and help to be present with whatever is causing discomfort in your life. Sometimes the most uncomfortable experiences can lead to the greatest growth. This herb is very effective when taken in a small amount of warm water prior to a meditation of any type. Next up is a very gentle, yet effective flower; which is chamomile. It provides a sense of calm and can help to soothe the nervous system. Chamomile is perfect for when you are feeling restless or irritable but still want to incorporate meditation into your routine. Drinking this herb as a tea can help you ease into a calm, meditative state. Because of its relaxing properties, yoga nidra, which is a systematic method of relaxation, would be perfect alongside chamomile. Last, but not least, is Holy Basil, or Tulsi. This herb has been used medicinally for more than 3000 years and helps maintain the balance of the body's energy systems and provide a sense of ease. Tulsi helps support a sense of calm and tranquility and can help you feel centered through chaotic life moments. Because of its calming properties, a third eye meditation would be paired well with tulsi to support the chakra and bring clarity. As recognized through Ayurveda, there are three energies that circulate the body and govern physiological activity, these are the doshas. Vatas have air like qualities, which means they tend to have a more flighty attention span. They are highly creative and imaginative, but often find themselves flooded with thoughts which can become overwhelming. Because there is so much energy running through a vata type person, it can be difficult to find internal stillness. To keep a vata mind focused, it is recommended they try chanting an affirmation or mantra. Pittas have fire like qualities, and they are very hyperproductive, organized and goal oriented. Pausing day-to-day life for meditation can be hard for a pitta type person because they live very fast paced. Pittas may find themselves trying to plan the week ahead of them during a meditation instead of letting their thoughts come and go. It is recommended that pittas try alternate nostril breathing. Lastly are kaphas which have earth like qualities. They are calm, grounded and nurturing. However, like the earth, they can be slow and dense. Kaphas may have a hard time not turning their meditation into a nap. A more interactive meditation is necessary for a kapha type person to stay focused. Kaphas should invoke mudras, which are hand gestures that evoke different qualities to connect the mind and body, while sitting upright so energy can flow up and down their spine. In conclusion, meditation is a wellness activity that can be enjoyed by all. This ancient practice is a must for the stress and anxiety of current times. Whether you need help sleeping, focusing, or just relaxing; there is a meditation for your situation. Therefore, now is the perfect time to start focusing on mindfulness, and building meditation into a daily routine becuase it can be performed by anybody, at any time, in any place. "}
