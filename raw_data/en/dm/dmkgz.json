Hill, D.C., Founding Executive, Chief Medical Officer and Chairman, Scientific Advisory Committee Exercise Burning a few extra calories through increasing physical activity had to be a component of my new lifestyle. As regular date nights at the movies became hikes and neighborhood bike rides, Deep Blue\u00ae Blend and Deep Blue\u00ae Rub became my daily companion. With my increased activity levels, I found that it was most con\u00ad venient to keep a bottle of both the oil and the rub in a desk drawer close to my front door.When I decided it was time to begin taking my own health more seriously, I didn't have to look very far for a road map. Health isn't about an extreme diet or exercise program, but a lifestyle focused on sustainable habits\u2014the six principles that make up the do-TERRA Wellness Lifestyle Pyramid. INFORMED SELF CAREPROACTIVE MEDICAL CARE REDUCE SYNTHETIC EXPOSURE REST & HARMONY EXERCISE EAT RIGHTLIFESTYLE HEALTHCARE Eat Right Cleaning up my diet, which included drastic changes to both what and how much I was eating, wasn't that complex, but there were some factors that you don't always consider. Even those who have the cleanest of diets often fall short when it comes to meeting their body's nutritional needs, which makes supplementing your diet critical for anybody seeking optimal health. Starting everyday with Microplex VMZ (NPN80075879) along with my breakfast and including it with my dinner is the foundation of my daily health habits. It provides the vitamins and minerals I may not get in my diet that day. I also regularly take Alpha CRS+\u00ae (NPN80071425) to protect against free radical damage and xEO Mega\u00ae (NPN80074456) for cardiovascular and brain health. All three are packaged together for convenience. This is known as the do\u00adTERRA Lifelong Vitality Convenience Pack (LLV). With a digestive system accustomed to highly processed food, the whole food diet I was embarking on would be an uncomfortable change. TerraZyme\u00ae (NPN80077027) provided those enzymes and cofactors necessary for gastrointestinal comfort and tolerance of fermentable carbohydrates. Health and longevity begin with how you fuel your body; the nutritional building blocks provided by a diet composted of whole foods and supplemented by LLV and TerraZyme is the foundation of any health\u00adpromoting plan. 2 1 4 DAILY HEALTH HABITSRest and Harmony You never really appreciate how important rest is until a lack of it is already having a powerful negative impact on your overall health. Setting up a consistent bedtime routine and actionable steps to reach harmony are paramount for overall health and well\u00adbeing. This is where Lavender and Balance\u00ae come in. I start each day by putting Balance on the bottoms of my feet to promote calmness, and I end the day by diffusing Lavender. The powerful combination of those two oils helps me maximize the times of the day that are meant for recovery. Reduce Synthetic Exposure Reducing synthetic exposure is becoming more important to me as we begin seeing longitudinal data that supports the logical notion that our environment and caustic substances we expose ourselves to can have real long\u00adterm health effects. This recent evidence has only strengthened my views about using naturally sourced products, minimizing exposure to synthetic materials, and supporting the body's natural pathways of detoxification. Along with using On Guard\u00ae cleaner and hand soap, I consume plenty of water to support the natural detoxification process of the body. It helps to add 1\u00ad3 drops of Grapefruit, Tangerine, or Lemon to the water for flavor. Informed Self-Care / Proactive Medical Care Self\u00adcare is probably the most subjective and individual of all the steps of the do\u00adTERRA Wellness Lifestyle Pyramid. How I feel day\u00adto\u00adday, how my body responds to supportive measures, and the type of health issues I feel comfortable addressing myself is highly distinct to me. I have found that the use of two specific products has a wide spectrum of benefits to promote well\u00adbeing on a daily basis. In my experience, and validated by a growing body of scientific research, Frankincense is the go\u00adto oil. It can be used aromatically for a peaceful mindset and topically to rejuvenate the skin. On Guard can cleanse and purify the air and can be rubbed on the bottom of feet for a soothing effect. While we have so much influence over our well-being through our lifestyle habits, some things are out of our control. You have to be proactive instead of reactive with medical care, and this is exactly what do-TERRA's healthcare initiative is all about. No matter how healthy my daily habits are, there are those times when I need the attention and expertise of my trusted family physician. Stick to the road map outlined by the do-TERRA Wellness Lifestyle Pyramid and create your own habits for lifelong health and vitality. 654 3 doterra.com / 5References: Svanes O, et al.

But the results are worth it.\" Source to You Insight doterra.com / 78 / 2018 LIVING MAGAZINEhe name arborvitae comes from the francophone version of the First Nation name meaning the \"tree of life.\" For 10,000 years, this tree has been instrumental in their everyday lives. They used the tree to build canoes, long houses, and totem poles. The Nootka tree is named after the Nootka tribe who resided in an area called the Nootka Sound. It is considered a \"twin\" to the arborvitae tree, and it has been used in many sculptures that are a significant part of the First Nation culture in that region. Both trees also play an important part in the Pacific Northwest's forestry industry, which is one of the largest and yet most environmentally sustainable in the world. This industry also produces tons of sawdust every year that is normally burned for energy. But, there are other uses for it too. do-TERRA partners with a Canadian distiller that has perfected the productive use of the sawdust from these two unique trees to produce pure quality oils with powerful properties. They are the only distillery in the world producing Arborvitae and Nootka essential oils.FOREST SUSTAINABLTIY British Columbia is well-known for its sustainable foresting practices. Their rate of deforestation has been virtually zero for more than 20 years. Their entire annual harvest comes from less than 1 percent of the working forest. By law, all harvested Co--Impact Sourcing\u00ae Arborvitae & Nootka British Columbia, Canada The Pacific Northwest is home to the largest temperate rainforest on the planet where more than 40 indigenous tree species grow, including the Giant Arborvitae and the Nootka coniferous trees. Both trees are an important part of the aboriginal First Nation history in British Columbia, Canada. In 2015, do-TERRA introduced Arborviate (Thuja plicata) as a single oil and in the recently reformulated do-TERRA TerraShield Essential Oil Blend, both Arborvitae and Nootka essential oils are featured as key oil ingredients. TArborvitae trees can live for up to 1,000 years, partially because they are naturally resistant to insects. Nootka and Arborvitae have both recently been added to the do-TERRA TerraShield essential oil blend. areas must be reforested. The seedlings must be native species, and none of them can be genetically modified. Arborvitae and Nootka essential oils came about because of an effort to make sustainable use of all the elements of the trees, including capturing the important chemical components found in the sawdust residue. Because of the sustainable forestry program in place for harvesting these trees, not one additional tree is being cut down to produce the essential oils. Once the oil is extracted from the sawdust through a proprietary steam distillation process, the sawdust is then returned and used by paper mills for pulp production. \"All the resources, including these amazing and unique essential oils, are sustainably and responsibly harvested from these majestic trees\u2014which of course is a key priority for our distillation partner and for do-TERRA ,\" says Tim Valentiner, do-TERRA Director of Strategic Sourcing. WHAT MAKES THESE OILS UNIQUE? Arborvitae Arborvitae essential oil has molecules called tropolo- nes, which have a unique chemical structure. Most mole- cules in nature are six-sided; tropolones are seven-sided. Nootka One chemical found in Nootka oil is nootkatone, which is strangely also found in grapefruits. This adds a sharp, citrusy note to Nootka oil and gives it similar properties to grapefruit oil. Brazil occupies roughly half of South America, covering a total area of 3,287,357 square miles. Within that area is 60 percent of the Amazon rainforest. Representing over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, the Amazon is comprised of the largest and most biodiverse area of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees. Therein lie the trees from which we source Copaiba oleoresin, which is distilled to produce Copaiba essential oil. Copaiba essential oil is so unique and effective because of its high level of beta-caryophyllene. Copaiba has the highest levels of beta-caryophyllene that we are aware of. Beta- caryophyllene, also known as BCP, is a terpene. For this reason Copaiba essential oil has become an invaluable part of the dTERRA collection. Copaiba essential oil can be found in items such as soaps, creams, lotions, and perfumes. Place 1-2 drops in a warm bath for a calming aroma, or try adding to a moisturizer to enhance the appearance of healthy looking skin. Copaiba essential oil is derived from the oleoresin of the copaiba tree, which can grow from 60 to 100 feet tall. The process of harvesting the copaiba oleoresin is similar to how one would tap a maple tree. A harvester will look for healthy trees that have large diameter trunks. They then drill a small hole approximately three feet from the ground. Once the hole has been drilled, the sawdust is cleaned off and the oleoresin collector is put in place. The harvester will generally be able to collect some oleoresin immediately. Once the oleoresin has been collected from the initial tap, a plug is inserted into the hole and the harvester will return to the tree every few weeks to collect additional oleoresin. The Amazon rainforest is very dense and nearly impossible to travel through with conventional vehicles. As such most travel for both personal and commercial purposes is done by boat. The complex network of smaller tributaries and larger rivers become the roads and highways by which goods are delivered. COPAIBA Essential oil of the Amazon 10 / 2018 LIVING MAGAZINEdTERRA utilizes a large network of harvesters that transport their copaiba oleoresin by boat from their different villages to Manaus. Once the oleoresin has been inspected, paid for, and collected in Manaus, we work with our distillation partner to steam distill the oleoresin and prepare it for final shipment to the US. During a recent sourcing trip, Ben Platt, dTERRA Strategic Sourcing Manager for the Americas, met a family of copaiba harvesters that were not a part of our current network. As they talked about copaiba, the harvester expressed frustration that he was getting pressured about the price for his copaiba oleoresin and that payment would frequently come much later than agreed upon. \"As I was talking with this family I quickly recognized that they were the type of people that dTERRA prefers to work with. It was clear that they knew their copaiba harvesting area very well. It was also clear that they were hardworking, honest people that would harvest the copaiba in the sustainable manner that dTERRA requires. We encouraged them to join our harvesting group and assured them that we would pay them on-time and at fair prices for their oleoresin. They were excited by this proposition and agreed to join our harvesting group. We are definitely glad that this family has joined the network of families that are now a key part of the dTERRA Global Botanical Network. This experience goes to highlight the importance of our mission to source the world's most beautiful oils from some of the world's best people. We source great people as much as we source essential oils.\" doterra.com / 11Hele, a veteran harvester from Egypt, starts her harvest with a headlamp, basket, and her fingers at 2:30 am. 12 / 2018 LIVING MAGAZINE Changing Lives one flower at a time NEROLI ESSENTIAL OIL Neroli, the flower from the bitter orange tree, was introduced into Egypt by the Arabs in 642 AD. Egyptian Neroli remains virtually untouched, unlike most orange trees across the world that have been altered by mix breeding. At the end of the 17th century, Anne Marie Orsini, Duchess of Bracciano and princess of Nerola, Italy, was said to be so fascinated with orange flower essence that she would bathe in it. She spread the practice to those around her, thus giving her name to the orange flower essence: Neroli. The Bitter Orange Tree is able to produce three different oils. Neroli comes from the flower of the tree. Petitgrain comes from the leaf and twig of the tree. Lastly, orange comes from the rind of the orange fruit. However, dTERRA Wild Orange is sourced from the sweet orange fruit. Producers can only choose one oil to cultivate because harvesting one will make it impossible for the other parts of the tree to mature. The Neroli flower only has a small window for harvest\u2014from mid-March to the end of April. JASMINE ABSOLUTE Jasmine is a species of more than 200 flowering vines and shrubs of the Oleaceae family. Known throughout history for its floral scent, Jasmine has been revered in countries such as China, Japan, and all throughout Southeast Asia. Pakistan has even designated Jasmine as its national flower. Jasmine differs from other oils because it is an absolute, which means the oil is extracted using a unique method. An absolute goes through a sophisticated process of separating the paraffins and waxes from the volatiles. This process allows for more of the aromatic compounds to be present in the absolute, resulting in an exquisite, yet potent final product. Due to the fragile nature of the Jasmine flower, steam distillation is too strenuous and will not produce the right compounds that we look for. HARVESTING FLOWERS What do Jasmine and Neroli have in common? They are both cultivated in Egypt. It takes 1 ton of Jasmine flowers to produce 3 pounds of jasmine absolute\u2014that's approximately 6,000,000 flowers. Jasmine and Neroli flowers are not picked by machines, but rather by hand, one by one. This goes to show how much time and effort goes into producing such beautiful oils. Each individual flower is not only changing the lives of those using them, but changing the lives of those harvesting them. Hele, a veteran harvester from Egypt, started out like many other harvesters, trying to earn money for her family. Beginning her day at 2:30 am, Hele starts her harvest with a headlamp, basket, and her fingers. Each day the harvesters are only allotted a certain amount of bushes to pick in order to prolong the life of the plant. Hele has been doing this for 10 years, getting faster and faster with time. Her speed has made it possible for her to get to other jobs and back to her family much quicker. When asked about her job, Hele says it is a great time to socialize with her friends. Many of the other harvesters are women in similar circumstances. This makes it more enjoyable and the time goes by much faster. Payments are fair and on time. In fact, the harvesters get to watch their loads get weighed to make sure the amount is correct. Hele may be just one harvester in Egypt, but her hard work in picking the flowers one by one makes it possible for us to enjoy the numerous benefits of Jasmine and Neroli. doterra.com / 13PETITGRAIN PARAGUAY Petitgrain comes from the leaf and twig of the bitter orange tree. do-TERRA is very specific about what we source, when we source it, how we source it, and which part of the plant we source. There are other types of Petitgrain: sweet orange, mandarin, lemon, and even grapefruit Petitgrain. So why did we choose bitter orange? It comes down to the therapeutic benefit we see. There are distinguishable differences between them. For example, mandarin is a great flavoring agent but has hardly any therapeutic benefit. Petitgrain is very similar to Lavender\u2014 you might even call it the \"manly Lavender\" because Petitgrain's smell is deeper and herb aceous. Comparing the chemistry of Lavender and Petitgrain, we see that Petitgrain has nearly four times less chemistry than Lavender.

No longer are farmers being underpaid. Farmers have the assurance of reliable payment, as well as a premium for the oil that is sourced. do-TERRA's Co-Impact Sourcing\u00ae initiative has not only changed the oil industry, but also individuals'' lives in communities.dTERRA recently teamed up with several Petitgrain farmers in Paraguay to ensure we receive the highest quality, purest oil sourced from the bitter orange tree. Petitgrain belongs to the Rutaceae family and is believed to have originated in Southeast Asia. During the establishment of the New World in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Spanish Jesuits brought the bitter orange plant with them. Orange trees quickly spread throughout the forests and jungles of Paraguay. Various hybrids were cultivated. Finding farmers that grew healthy crops of the bitter orange tree proved difficult at first. Once dTERRA secured enough farmers for the needed amount, we began educating. At dTERRA, we are uncompromising when it comes to purity and potency. Due to this strict standard, we have ongoing trainings for these farmers to ensure purity and potency for generations to come. When dTERRA went to Paraguay to identify farmers with whom we wanted to partner and source Petitgrain oil, run-down distillation facilities and collapsed wells were found. Since dTERRA has started working in Paraguay with these farming families, new interest has sparked in Petitgrain production and dTERRA has been able to be the catalyst for revitalizing several Petitgrain production areas that are particularly in need of economic opportunity. \"Through supplying technical assistance and training on methods for improving distillation practices and oil quality, as well as providing guaranteed long-term contracts to these partner farming families, dTERRA Co-Impact Sourcing is truly able to provide sustainable opportunities in these impoverished areas,\" stated Tim Valentiner, dTERRA Director of Strategic Sourcing. \"This is always at the core of what we hope to accomplish through Co-Impact Sourcing.\" Jared Moon, dTERRA Strategic Sourcing Manager, has been managing sourcing efforts in Paraguay since 2016. \"Having lived in Paraguay, it has been amazing to go back and work with rural farmers. This project has been near and dear to my heart because of the love I share with the people of Paraguay. I know a farmer with three kids in college. This farmer has a tiny house out in a rural area of Paraguay, but he is able to send his three kids to college due to the premium that we pay. By working with rural farmers and rural areas that are very impoverished, we'll be able to provide jobs for the famers themselves as well as an incentive for their children to stay there and work the land these families have harvested for decades.\" doterra.com / 15The purposes behind the dTERRA\u00ae Co-Impact Sourcing\u00ae initiative are varied. From ensuring the highest quality essential oil to facilitating humanitarian efforts with commu- nities where our oils are sourced, each \"co-impact sourced\" oil presents a unique opportunity to have an impact on the world. In the case of Douglas Fir, one of the most unique benefits is the positive impact the sourcing of this oil has on New Zealand's environment. \"With this Douglas Fir essential oil,\" says Tim Valentiner, Director of Strategic Sourcing, \"we have been able to create with our partners a truly unique essential oil that provides tremendously positive environmental impacts for New Zealand's biodiverse landscape, highlighting the environ\u00ad mental responsibility objectives of Co\u00adImpact Sourcing.\"Wilding Pines Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is an evergreen conifer species native to western North America that has been used primarily in the lumber industry. However, in New Zealand, Douglas Fir has been categorized by the government as an invasive species. It was planted originally for the lumber industry, and from there it bred very rapidly and uncontrollably into areas where it wasn't intended to grow. The trees grow 25 times faster in New Zealand than in North America, and the dense root systems push out all or many of the native species of plants, making it nearly impossible for anything else to grow. Douglas Fir trees, which are known as \"wilding conifers\" in New Zealand, are also self \u00adseeding. This means that they produce seeds that fall to the ground and replant themselves in that location. These seeds germinate then begin to sprout and grow at the start of the growing season. By the end of the season, new seeds are produced and begin the cycle over again. This, coupled with the rate of growth in New Zealand, is the cause behind the \"wilding conifer\" problem with Douglas Fir. dTERRA Solution T o help alleviate the environmental impacts of this wilding problem, dTERRA established an exclusive sourcing partnership with a small\u00adscale company. This company works through government and other programs for the harvesting of these invasive Douglas Fir trees for raw materials, and then distills them into an invigorating and truly unique essential oil. Choosing to source Douglas Fir oil from New Zealand provides dTERRA with an opportunity to participate in a project that is very socially innovative and New Zealand Douglas Fir Commitment to Environmental Responsibility Commitment to Environmental Responsibility 16 / 2018 LIVING MAGAZINENew Zealand Douglas Fir\"We are reducing the problem, we are having a great ecological impact, and, in return, we get this beautiful essential oil.\" -Dr. David K. Hill THE FACTS BEHIND DOUGLAS FIR ESSENTIAL OIL Douglas Fir has both alpha-Pinene and beta-Pinene, two powerful monoterpenes. This chemical com- pound is what gives Douglas Fir both an invigorating and calming aroma.The trees are harvested at a young age as part of a biodiversity conserva- tion program, which actually changes the chemical composition of the oil.The lower temperature of distillation through utilizing a vacuum process creates an oil that has more volatile aromatic compounds. environmentally responsible\u2014literally turning a problem or pest into a beautiful, sustainable product. Harvesting, Distilling, and Sustainability The trees which are targeted for harvesting to help counteract the wilding problem are typically young, pre\u00adconing pines before they are able to reproduce and spread seed. Once the raw material has been collected, the distillation method used is a specialized distillation process that captures the very aromatic, light notes that are found in the Douglas Fir. Through utilizing a proprietary vacuum steam distillation process, it is able to run at a much lower temperature preventing the lightest, most volatile notes from flashing off. In essential oil form, dTERRA Douglas Fir boasts a lemon\u00adscented note that is both sweet and refreshing. Due to a unique chemical composition that is rich in beta\u00adpinene, which contributes to its ability to purify the skin and promote a positive mood, Douglas Fir also promotes an uplifting environment while freshening the air.Due to the quick maturation of Douglas Fir trees in New Zealand, there is an overabundance, which makes this source very sustainable. Though we have made a small dent in the amount of trees that need to be removed, there are still many years of New Zealand Douglas Fir yet to come, creating a long\u00adlasting opportunity to work alongside New Zealanders in combating this problem while supplying a unique essential oil unlike any other conifer essential oil. doterra.com / 17Tune 7 8 10 12 13 14 15 16 17 19 21 24 266 22 2318 20 259431 2 11 5.

Use a Reusable Shopping Bag Plastic grocery bags take anywhere from 15-1,000 years to decompose, and only about 1-2 percent of plastic bags are recycled in the USA. Paper bags are not much better. According to USA Today, it takes four times as much energy to produce paper bags compared to plastic bags, and 85 times as much energy is needed to recycle them. One of the best things you can do is invest in high-quality reusable bags to avoid the need for use of disposable plastic or paper bags. 2. Reduce Food Waste According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), about 95 percent of the food we throw away ends up in landlls or combustion facilities. Here are a few simple things you can do to reduce food waste in your home: Carefully plan your shopping and grocery lists. When you go grocery shopping, make sure you don't buy too much food. Store fruits and vegetables in the right places for maximum freshness. Freeze, dehydrate, and can excess fruits and vegetables. If you have leftovers, save them so you can enjoy them later. You can also donate excess food to food banks and local charities for people in need. 3. Repurpose and Reuse Find creative ways to repurpose empty containers or other old items. Reuse empty essential oil bottles to create your own blends. Make crafts using recycled material. It's a great way to engage your family in creative projects while teaching them about the environment. 4. Try Organic Gardening Aside from knowing exactly where your food comes from and other amazing health benets, growing your own organic garden also helps the planet in many ways, including saving time, fuel, and reducing waste. You can compost certain foods and turn it into nutrient-rich fertilizer for your garden. New to gardening? Check out this blog post (bit.ly/2jXRrZa) to help you get started. 5. Buy a Water Bottle Instead of buying plastic water bottles, purchase a quality water bottle that you can reuse every day. Double-wall, vacuum-installed, stainless steel water bottles keep your water cool up to 12 hours. You could also purchase a simple glass water bottle\u2014both options are safe for essential oil use.6. Use Fewer Chemicals Replacing harmful chemicals with more eco-friendly agents will remove some hazards from your home and help the earth. Use essential oils, dTERRA On Guard\u00ae Cleaner Concentrate, and other natural cleaning agents such as baking soda, vinegar, and salt. 7.

The previous record had been set in January of 2017 at 1,002 kits. Jimmy Coggins, an adjudicator from GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS, oversaw the attempt, verified that all components made it into the kits, and counted the kits at the end. To actually assemble the kits, 10 separate items had to be collected and placed into bags. With over 300 volunteers helping assemble kits, the participants ran out of kit components at 36 minutes and 41 seconds. Together they were able to assemble 5,110 kits. The assembled kits will be distributed during the dTERRA Co-Impact Sourcing\u00ae Expeditions in Kenya, Nepal, Guatemala, and Haiti. What makes the kits even more special is the fact that every item in the kit is based on the feedback from the girls that use them\u2014 including fabric shields, liners, panties, wash cloths, soap, instructions, and a beautiful drawstring bag that can also be used for schoolwork. Each kit lasts three years and provides dignity and freedom to girls around the world.

The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.8Mw or 8.1Ms and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of IX (Violent). \"Spikenard was an oil that we had on our radar for quite some time,\" said Jared Moon, do-TERRA Strategic Sourcing Manager. \"So we added it to our post- earthquake economic impact efforts.\" Spikenard is a primitive oil that has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic practices for its clarifying and grounding aroma, as well as helping the appearance of skin and hair. Spikenard is a great addition to our collection. The exciting thing about Spikenard is that it is being produced and harvested in areas completely separate from Wintergreen. 30 / 2018 LIVING MAGAZINEFACT: It took the Spikenard film crew eight days of trekking on foot to get to the areas where they could capture the needed footage.\"When in doubt get your Spikenard out.\" \u2014Dr. Hill The C-Impact Sourcing\u00ae initiative in Nepal has brought many benefits to the Nepalese people. One of the biggest has been creating added jobs involved in Spikenard harvesting, drying, and distillation. The Himalayan regions of western Nepal, where the vast majority of the Spikenard is harvested, is one of the country's poorest areas, so any economic activity that we can bring to the region is a great benefit. A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A NEPALESE HARVESTER Harvesting Spikenard is a very time-consuming and challenging activity. It only grows in the higher altitudes\u20143,000 m to 5,000 m (about 9,850 ft. to 16,400 ft.)\u2014and generally on the cooler, western side of steep hills (40\u00b0-70\u00b0 inclined slopes). Accessing these locations takes multiple days and requires the harvesters, who also tend to be goat herders, to set up a basecamp from which they work. Because they are harvesting the roots, harvesters have to dig them out of the ground, clean off the dirt, and keep going all day. The Spikenard harvest is restricted to a few months of the year so they have to work quickly and carefully to ensure that the plants will regrow for the next harvest. It is physically demanding working at those altitudes and requires long stints away from their homes and families. Finding new oils to source is not our only objective. We want to help build the individuals, regions, and countries that we come in contact with. We also want to make sure those sourcing the oils have the resources to increase their income. One of our objectives in Nepal is to help them cultivate Spikenard. Our hope is that through cultivation we will increase the amount of root material that the plants produce and make accessing the plants less time consuming. The second objective is a project to install solar dryers so the harvesters can dry the roots rather than selling the fresh roots to a drying facility.\"The majority of Spikenard's chemistry is comprised of four or five compounds, and it makes up from 60-70 percent of its chemistry. It is a fairly dominant type profile that we always expect in Spikenard. In our Spikenard essential oil, we have identified 170 different compounds. Not only do we have vast amounts of chemistry, but we have non-focused chemistry. The complete opposite of what we see with essential oils that are more dominant,\" explains Dr. David K. Hill, D.C.. The Nepalese people are strong, hardworking, and hopeful\u2014 hopeful for a better, more independent life. Through doTERRA's Co-Impact Sourcing they have found that hope. With doTERRA's help, they are creating and sustaining their families and communities, all while growing in their knowledge of the land. The harvesting and distillation of Spikenard will not only benefit those sourcing it but those who partake of it. With Spikenard's many benefits and uses, it's no wonder Dr. Hill says, \"When in doubt get your Spikenard out.\" doterra.com / 31 DIY: Hand-knitted WOOL BLANKET 32 / 2018 LIVING MAGAZINEHand-knitted doterra.com / 33 Form a simple slipknot, keep it loose, and leave about a 6 inch tail.

With a quick trip to the corner grocery store, we have every variety of fruit and vegetable available to us, regardless of what time of year it is. Fresh blueberries in your morning oatmeal in December? Sure. Fresh grape tomatoes in dinner's salad in the dead of winter? No problem. But, unless you are buying in-season produce, fresh is a bit of misnomer. Buying fruits and vegetables while they are in season ensures that you are getting the best-tasting and most nutrient-dense foods available. For optimum health and food enjoyment, spend some time learning about the harvesting seasons. True Meaning of Fresh Produce not in season makes quite the trek to your local supermarket, taking anywhere from three days to several weeks, traveling on average nearly 2,000 miles. T o ensure that they don't spoil along the way, fruits and vegetables are picked before they have reached full maturity, meaning they have not only yet to reach their peak aroma and taste, but nutritional content as well. Theoretically, they should ripen during transportation, but this isn't always the case. After harvesting, exposure to air, temperature changes, and artificial light all result in vitamin and mineral degradation and the necessity for more preservatives. Numerous studies have shown that produce picked at maturity and either consumed immediately or flash frozen on-site have higher levels of vital nutrients than what ends up in your grocery store display.* In particular, levels of vitamin C and antioxidants are especially sensitive to early harvesting. Studies have shown that fresh vegetables can lose up to 51 percent of their vitamin C content within 48 hours of being picked.* Even when stored in refrigerated environments, vegetables can lose nearly half of their water-soluble doterra.com / 34 antioxidant activity within a matter of days.* We buy \"fresh\" fruits and vegetables because of superior taste and perceived nutritional benefits, but unless it is October, that crisp Fuji apple you just took a bite out of wasn't fresh at all. June through August, instead of baking your famous apple pie for dessert, take advantage of seasonal freshness and try peach instead. Roasted acorn squash may sound delicious, but replace it with zucchini, which is at its nutritional peak in the summer. Benefits of In-Season Produce Along with a more pleasant aroma and taste and better nutrient profiles, in a display of Mother Nature's brilliance, in-season produce often contains higher levels of specific constituents that are in greater need that time of year. For instance, summer fruits tend to have a higher water content so that you can meet hydration needs while enjoying the warm season weather. Watermelon and strawberries have the highest fluid content of any fruits, at approximately 92 percent water per volume, narrowly outpacing other summer fruits, such as grapefruit and cantaloupe. Similarly, summer cucumber and zucchini are nearly 96 percent water. Research has shown that refueling with summer fruits and vegetables actually rehydrates you better after a workout than drinking water or even most sports drinks thanks to the precise combination of water, amino acids, electrolytes, and vitamins that are lost through perspiration.* Due to extended darkness and cold weather, we tend to need more dietary vitamin D throughout the fall and winter; not surprisingly, some of the best sources of vitamin D, such as portabella mushrooms, are at their peak in the fall. A recently published review and meta-analysis has also provided some evidence that foods high in vitamin D may support the proper function of the immune system, reducing risk for all those winter season health threats.* Mother Nature knows what she's doing. T ake advantage of the abundant summer growing season by picking up some truly fresh raspberries and sugar snap peas for the family to snack on. Y our health and your taste buds will thank you. * Seaso n SEASONAL EATING TI PS 1. Check your regions growing guide to help you determine what produce is in season. 2. Visit a local farmer's market or go straight to the source: a farm. 3. Pay attention to in-store prices. T ransportation isn't free; in-season produce tends to be cheaper. 4. Support your local small-scale farmers by joining a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). 5. Plant your own garden for a great family activity. *For research references email: scienceblog@doterra.com doterra.com / 3536 / 2018 LIVING MAGAZINE Aroma & TouchTHE SCIENCE OF The AromaTouch Technique\u00ae is a combination of two of the most powerful senses, used in conjunction to establish one simple way to give those you care for an individual essential oil experience. But just because it's simple doesn't mean it isn't profound. Whether it's offering a hand technique to a new acquaintance or a full AromaTouch Technique to a close friend, the olfactory and sensory stimulation induced by volatile aromatic compounds and human touch is a scientifically validated means to developing a strong connection with someone and positively influencing their well-being. doterra.com / 37 doterra.com / 37Aroma is an important component of the AromaTouch Technique because it instantaneously prompts powerful emotional, physiological, and biochem- ical responses. As research has exhibited, activating your olfactory system can direct your mind to specific memories, relax you, positively influence the function of different body systems, and help create a close connection with whomever you are sharing the experience with. Have you ever wondered how walking through an orange grove can immediately induce powerful memories of your childhood? Or how the faint aroma of cinnamon can remind you of mom's Sunday-morning cinnamon rolls, even 30 years later? It is basic human biology. There is a direct connection between your nose and your brain's emotional control center: the limbic system. This is because the olfactory bulb is the only neural structure in the forebrain that takes input to the amygdala yet does not receive reciprocal projections. In other words, information from your nose goes directly to the limbic system, which controls mood, memory, and emotions. Your body also contains far more receptors associated with smell (over 1,000) than it does for any other sense. Due to this, you are capable of discerning countless aromas\u2014many of which you may not even be able to describe\u2014with amazing sensitivity and accuracy. Human biology has made the olfactory system the most subtle yet effective means to induce specific and distinct responses. This is one of the primary reasons why essential oils can be so powerful in influencing well-being. The AromaTouch Technique is all about creating an emotional connection, and the science behind that connection is as validated as it is compelling. Tactile communication is our first form of communication. We begin receiving tactile signals in the womb, and then touch plays a critical role in parent-child relationships before verbal communi- cation is possible. It is, in essence, the first sense we acquire and it is astonish - ingly effective. In recent studies, research- ers have shown that emotional commun- ication is very effective through touch, nearly as effective as words and facial cues. Not only is touch able to communicate the tone of emotion (whether it is positive or negative, intense or subtle), but it may allow for precise differentiation between types of emotion. With voice and facial cues, we can identify just one or two positive signals that are not confused with each other. Research has exhibited that touch can communicate multiple emotions\u2014 love, gratitude, sympathy, fear, anger\u2014 and with astounding exactness. This effect isn't just limited to loved ones; another study found that touch communicates emotion nearly as effectively when it occurs between strangers. While our understanding of the mechanisms involved with touch and emotional messaging is still limited, we do know that it can be more effective than even verbal communication in strengthening existing bonds and developing new ones. Along with the emotional component, gentle touch can also influence physiological responses in ways other communication simply cannot.Unlike massage, which involves powerful hand movements that are focused on specific outcomes (breakdown of muscular adhesions, stimulating the central nervous system, aiding recovery, etc.), the gentleness of an AromaTouch Technique has a much different spectrum of benefits. Tender touch almost instantaneously activates the release of oxytocin (often referred to as the \"love\" or \"hug\" hormone), decreases heart rate and blood pressure, and has a beneficial influence on multiple other stress-sensitive systems. Furthermore, the person initiating the contact generally experiences the same response as the person on the receiving end. Unlike a massage, the benefits of giving an Aromatouch Technique to someone can be just as powerful as receiving one. The AromaTouch Technique is a scientific approach to combining smell, tactile communication, and the power of CPTG\u00ae essential oils to improve well-being.

Affirmations are words that you say to yourself to improve your life. They can be about anything you want to happen in your life, anything you want to feel more of, anything you want to become, anything you want to attract, and more. You can say things about yourself that aren't even necessarily true yet. The key word is \"yet\" be- cause once you begin saying these things to yourself on a daily basis, your wor ds will soon become your actions and your reality. You can become the person you want to be by simply telling yourself you are that person and truly believing it. How to start using affirmations: Write down your affirmations and put them everywhere you are going to see them like a sticky note on your mirror, by your bed, in your car, in your journal, or your phone background. Every time you see it, read it out loud. You can also say affirmations right when you wake up and right before you go to sleep. Here are some oils that help with creating a healthy self-image and an affirmation to say with each one. AFFIRMATI ONS with Oils Balance\u00ae: Balance creates a sense of calm and well-be- ing. It provides for a grounding, balancing effect on your emotions.

I love caring for my body and I am healthy and strong. 5 Ways to Improve Your SOCIAL MEDIA Improve your social media and improve your business. It may sound simple and that's because it is. Just follow these five steps: 1. CREATE YOUR ACCOUNTS: It can be a little overwhelming at first to start marketing yourself on social media when you don't know where to begin. If you try to create Facebook, Instagram, Amplify, Blog, and Pinterest accounts all at the same time, you're going to find yourself on your bed, curled up in a ball, and way too overwhelmed. The trick is to start off with just one or two platforms that you are comfortable with and, as time goes on, add more. FACEBOOK: Facebook is great to post your content on and also plan your dTERRA sharing parties. If you are holding a party to share dTERRA oils with others, creating a Facebook Event is a great way to get your friends aware of the party and track your guest list. Facebook Live is also a great tool to use to engage with followers and hold an open questionnaire. AMPLIFY: Amplify is a great tool to use for caption ideas or to get quality photos to share. dTERRA has an Amplify account where we post the photos we've created from our photoshoots with captions including DIY ideas, links to videos about the company, ways to use the oils, and more. It is easy for you to share these photos onto your own Amplify or other social media accounts and you can keep the captions or edit them to create your own. BLOG: If you love writing, blogging can be a great platform for you. If you want to engage your followers with longer stories of how to use the oils, in-depth DIYS, or success stories, start your blog today. You can check out the dTERRA blog for ideas. INSTAGRAM: Instagram can be used like Facebook but all your posts include a picture. You can also go live on Instagram to connect with followers, do a questionnaire, demonstrate how to use an oil, and more. If you love to create and love the aesthetics of photos, Instagram will work for you. And remember, you can use our photos from Amplify or create your own. YOUTUBE: If you are a bubbly person who loves to talk and interact with your followers, create your own YouTube channel! You can talk personally with your audience and explain the oils and products while demonstrating how to use them. It's a fun way for your followers to get to know you and will appeal to those who are visual learners. PINTEREST: Pinterest is a great platform to get ideas from. You can search DIYs, how to use the oils, and more. You can post your own ideas on there too! 2. BE A CONSISTENT USER: You should try and post every day. Your followers are following you for a reason, they want to see what you have to share. If you need ideas of what to post every day, go to dTERRA's social media sites, visit Pinterest or other Wellness Advocate's accounts to find inspiration. Pay attention to the feedback your followers are giving you. Make sure to answer all their questions and reply to all their comments. Make sure they know they are being heard and cared for. 3. CREATE YOUR OWN PERSONAL BRAND: Think about why you are an amazing Wellness Advocate. What makes you stand out? Are you funny, creative, exciting, or passionate? Why should people want to buy from you? Why should people believe you? Why should they support you? Figure out why you are awesome and target your posts to that. Your posts should have a conversational and professional tone but you should also be yourself. Don't be afraid to share personal stories and be real with your audience. They will love you for being you and you will gain their trust. 4. CROSS-MARKET: A successful social media marketer shares their content on multiple platforms. You can post a picture of Lavender on your Instagram that will direct followers to check out the blog you wrote on \"5 ways to use Lavender,\" and include the link to your blog. Or, you can post on Instagram and say, \"Make sure you tune in to my live stream today on Facebook at 3 PM!\" Remember, as with anything in life, practice makes perfect. If you are still getting used to your social media accounts, keep posting and you will get the hang of it eventually. If having too many accounts is stressful for you, delegate tasks! Ask someone to run one of the social media platforms you are less comfortable with. That way you can focus on your other accounts and the business side with no stress. 5. MEASURE YOUR RESULTS: Keep track of your followers. Notice when you lose or gain followers after certain posts. How much do you love a friend who never asks about your life? Probably not very much. Same goes for followers, make sure you engage with your audience. Encourage feedback and ask them what they want to hear or see more of. Address all questions that are directed to you in a timely manner. Participate in Giveaways - hold contests and reward your followers for being loyal to you. Love the Skin You're In DR. AMY WOLTHOFF, MD, BOARD CERTIFIED DERMATOLOGIST dTERRA has hit a home run with the new skin care line! Not only do the products improve the overall appearance of skin, but they now have added cutting-edge ingredients that attend to the most common concerns patients ask me about regarding their skin. General Skin Healthcare CLEANSE: A good cleanser is important to rid the skin of excess oils, makeup and pollution. The Creamy Facial Cleanser utilizes natural saponins of Yucca Root and Soapbark extract. It has Macadamia seed oil, vitamin E and an amino acid derived humectant from Proline to help with conditioning the skin and protecting the barrier. EXFOLIATE: An exfoliator is important to remove dead skin and other pore clogging impurities. I love dTERRA Invigorating Scrub with the gentle jojoba esters that not only exfoliate, but also have moisturizing properties. The included Burdock extract can help purify and tone the skin. Ideally, the cleanser and exfoliator you use should not irritate the skin. Some of my patients feel the rougher the scrub the better results they will get. In reality, any repeated irritation can lead to long-term damage to the skin's appearance. MOISTURIZE: After gentle cleansing it is important to use a moisturizer whether your skin is oily or dry. It should be something that you do every day, just like drinking water. You should drink water whether you are thirsty or not. By the time you feel thirsty, you are likely already dehydrated. It's the same with dry or cracked skin. Moisturizers play a role in not only conditioning the skin, but also reinforcing the skin's natural barrier against environmental pollutants. The Anti- Aging Moisturizer does this along with the added benefit of including peptides and summer snowflake bulb exact that help with skin tone, texture and reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. CONDITION: If your skin is a little more on the dry side, the Hydrating Cream does an amazing job at conditioning while soothing the skin. One of the main ingredients is cocoa seed butter, known to be a nutrient rich emollient. The included probiotics provide more intense hydration and aid in the skin barrier renewal process. Most people do not realize that even just dry skin can cause unsightly redness. Moisturizing is one of the most important steps in nourishing your largest organ! PROTECT: During and after enhancing the appearance of your skin, you will need to protect your investment. Make sure that before stepping outside (even if just driving in your car) you put on a broad-spectrum sunscreen. Many of my patients are surprised to find out that UVA rays penetrate window glass. You may not realize this because it is not the sunburn ray (UVB), but UVA is responsible for sunspots and premature aging. 42 / 2018 LIVING MAGAZINESpecific Concerns DARK SPOTS: dTERRA Brightening Gel addresses dark spots from years of sun causing uneven pigmentation. The gel utilizes natural properties of Juniper Berry, Melissa, and furanocoumarin-free Bergamot (important because it does not increase risk for sun sensitization) in a special vitamin C base. Many cosmetics have vitamin C (a natural brightener) but if it's not in a specific formulation, it can break down prior to the active molecule reaching its target. In the Brightening Gel, the vitamin C is protected from oxygen exposure breakdown by microencapsulation technology. I love the included Ginger root extract known for anti- redness and calming properties. FINE LINES AND WRINKLES: There are many anti- aging products on the market. To simplify, I tell my patients the most important ingredient to help promote renewed skin is retinol, a vitamin A derivative. The limiting factor to consistent use of retinol is often dryness and irritation. The new Eye Cream uses Bakuchiol (a natural retinoid-like compound), Frankincense, Ylang Ylang, and Blue Tansy (combined with the amazing cool rollerball applicator) to help with the common issues around the eyes including the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, dark circles, and puffiness. These are complemented with the meadowfoam seed oil and two other natural polysaccharides known to soothe and hydrate, while tightening the skin. The Tightening Serum made with Frankincense, Sandalwood, and Myrrh supports skin elasticity and suppleness. Rhizobian and acacia gum provide the lifting benefits. As we age our collagen and elastin (what makes our skin tight and supple) is broken down faster than it can be produced, often leaving behind the appearance of sagging, wrinkled skin. Perfluorodecalin in the serum promotes skin renewal and elasticity to help tighten and tone.. DULL SKIN/PORES: Astringents can be helpful for balancing and toning the skin. The Pore Reducing Toner uses Lavender, Ylang Ylang, and German Chamomile to remove traces of remaining oil and dirt, which can build up and dull the appearance of the skin, without drying the skin. The oligosaccharide rich lentil extracts increase skin hydration while helping reduce oily looking skin. This combined with the Invigorating Scrub will increase luminosity and brightness of the skin. doterra.com / 43GUY'S GUIDE TOOLS OF THE TRADE ACCESS YOUR INNER HANDYMAN WITH THESE TRICKS FOR USING dTERRA LEMON ESSENTIAL OIL.

The logical response is to ramp up the workout intensity or volume and cut out those last few calories, but the most effective measure may be to do nothing at all. Sleep is one of the most important factors in maintaining optimal metabolism, supporting normal endocrine function, and regulating appetite. If you are serious about your body, optimum health doesn't always begin in the gym or the kitchen, but often between the sheets. SLEEP EFFECTS Exercise and Weight Management 48 / 2018 LIVING MAGAZINE Sleep requirements change over the course of an individual's life; therefore, guidelines are primarily based on one's age. The National Sleep Foundation recommends up to 17 hours per day for newborns, and down to 6-8 for older adults. Advocates increased sleep time for those with particularly active lifestyles. There are also a series of sleep hygiene recommendations that can help you get the most out of your bedtime. The latest guidelines suggest not napping during the day to maintain normal patterns, avoiding stimulants later in the day, and establishing a consistent bedtime routine. One of the most important factors to keep in mind is that experts almost universally agree that attempting to \"catch up\" on sleep is a losing proposition. Even if you may initially feel more rested, following sleep deprivation with longer bouts of sleeping ultimately affects your circadian rhythms and may make it more difficult to set a consistent regimen. Like healthy eating and exercise, the effectiveness of sleep is highly dependent on consistency. Lack of sleep can have significant metabolic and endocrine effects that may reduce or even completely undo the success of your weight management efforts. Cortisol, the \"stress hormone\" secreted during times when the \"fight or flight\" response mechanism is initiated, is proving to be one of the most important factors in both fat loss and lean muscle tissue gain. In fact, one recent study found that participants on a professionally designed diet and exercise program found it impossible to lose weight when not reaching sleep recommendations1. Cortisol levels influence body composition by inhibiting the processing of amino acids, obstructing growth hormone release, altering the proper regulation of blood sugar levels, and even making it more difficult to stick to diets.2 A 2010 study found that those functioning on less than optimal levels of sleep had higher levels of cortisol throughout the day, and subsequently had less success in their weight management efforts.3 If you are experiencing an otherwise unexplainable uptick on the scale, it may be time to reevaluate your sleeping patterns. Recent research suggests that sleep deprivation may also sabotage your dieting efforts. Sleeping less than six hours has been shown to increase hunger, increase cravings for sweets, and ultimately may lead to weight gain.4,5 Sleep- deprived individuals often exhibit several endocrine irregularities directly associated with appetite and weight regulation. Lack of sleep can increase the secretion of ghrelin, \"the hunger hormone,\" which regulates satiety and reward perception accompanying specific foods. Sleep deprivation appears to increase caloric consumption through two separate mechanisms, by increasing the sensitivity of the brain's reward system for ingesting energy-dense foods and encouraging one to eat more in response to the extra energy expended while staying up as opposed to sleeping. If you are having difficulty sticking to your healthy diet goals, the culprit may be your sleeping patterns. The amount and quality of sleep also may impact your workout performance. One recent study found that short-term sleep deprivation resulted in significantly decreased strength, power, and cardiovascular performance.6 After only a single night of less than adequate sleep, study participants exhibited characteristics similar to those suffering from overtraining, and the effects seemed to increase over time. Another study found that disturbed sleep patterns adversely affect cognitive function and reaction time, which can increase exercise accident risk.7 Furthermore, lack of sleep has been shown to be detrimental to exercise recovery, meaning you may need to exercise less and expend more effort on proactive recovery techniques to continue progressing and remain injury free.8 If you don't feel like working out today or notice your intensity and performance waning, the first step should not be toward a stimulant, but your bed. Progressing towards your fitness goals requires a lot of dedication, hard work, and even more rest. Practice good sleep hygiene\u2014 follow a consistent sleep and wake schedule; avoid stimulating food and drink before bedtime; turn down lights and turn off screens an hour before you plan to sleep; and make your bedroom and bed as comfortable as possible. Many find it helpful to establish relaxing nighttime rituals, such as sipping teas, taking a bath, or reading a book. References 1.

Sleep DeprivationGuidelines doterra.com / 4950 / 2018 LIVING MAGAZINE One of the easiest and most effective ways to enjoy essential oils is through diffusion. Placing a few drops of oil in an essential oil diffuser can immediately alter the atmosphere of your home, office, hotel room, or any indoor area, as the potent aroma of essential oils travel through the air. The beauty of using an essential oil diffuser is that it gives you the ability to combine and blend several oils\u2014thus creating a new aroma that offers the benefits of more than one essential oil, while producing a custom, unique aroma. Diffuser Blend Master How to Become a doterra.com / 51 STEP 1 - CHOOSE YOUR BLEND TYPE Decide what effect you want from your diffuser blend. Do you want to promote feelings of relaxation? Do you want something invigorating or motivating? Are you trying to create a specific environment? Once you determine the goal of your diffuser blend, it will be much easier to choose your oils. Whether you need to create an environment of focus and motivation while you study for a test, or want to fill your room with a calming aroma before bedtime, choosing the right oils for your diffuser blend can help you create a specific atmosphere. STEP 2 - SELECT AN OIL GROUP Next, select a group of oils that fit the description you want to achieve. If you want a relaxing diffuser blend, choose oils that are known for their calming properties. If you want something that creates an uplifting environment, choose essential oils with a bright, refreshing aroma.STEP 3 - PAIRING Once you've selected a group of oils that you think will help you achieve the desired effect, you can begin pairing them together. T ake the lids off of 2-4 essential oil bottles and hold them directly under your nose. This will give you a good idea of what the oils smell like together. Switch out different oils to see which combination you like best. While oils of the same kind (citrus, floral, mint, etc.) typically pair well together, you don't have to stay within a specific oil category when creating your diffuser blend\u2014it can be fun to mix things up! STEP 4 - BLENDING When you've landed on a few oils that you want to blend together, it is time to place them in the diffuser. Y ou may choose to do several drops of a certain oil and only one drop of another. The amount of each oil you choose to add will change the aroma (and even the effect) of the diffuser blend. STEP 5 - ENJOY! Once you've placed the oils in your diffuser, it is time to enjoy your creation. After experiencing what your diffuser blend smells like and the environment it creates, you can make adjustments to your diffuser blend by removing certain oils, adding in other oils, or adjusting the amount of drops the next time you make it. Whether you need to create an environment of focus and motivation while you study for a test, or want to fill your room with a calming aroma before bedtime, choosing the right oils for your diffuser blend can help you create a specific atmosphere.
