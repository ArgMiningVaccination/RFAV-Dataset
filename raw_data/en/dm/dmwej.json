Personalised for you Building a timeline of your health and illness progression and in-depth functional testing helps us to identify root causes of illness or dysfunction and create a health plan that is tailored to your own specific needs. Scientific approach Advanced laboratory testing may be used alongside a detailed case history to reveal the underlying issues causing chronic symptoms and dysfunction.

Click on the Link to Download the Functional Medicine Test: [Self Care Questionnaire](https://chelmsfordchiropractor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Self-CareQuestionnaire.pdf) A Bottom Up Approach to Health Instead of suppressing symptoms, Functional Medicine asks WHY has the symptom occurred in the first place? With careful investigation, we can gain an understanding of how each individual functions and what makes them unwell. This knowledge is the key to creating a treatment plan which aims to alleviate the underlying problem. This plan often involves key nutrients, herbs and some lifestyle and dietary changes but it is always in a collaborative approach with YOU the patient making sure the changes are manageable. Functional Medicine is an approach that is rapidly gaining popularity around the world and only began in 1990 by Dr Jeffrey Bland. This approach integrates cutting edge science and laboratory testing with the latest research on diet and nutrition, with herbal medicine and the ages old holistic approach of looking at the whole person. This means seeing an individual as a complex being a sum of many interacting parts and not as separate systems as modern healthcare practices do. The results from our clinic and those of functional doctors around the world continue to demonstrate this as a safe and effective method for the treatment of many health problems.
