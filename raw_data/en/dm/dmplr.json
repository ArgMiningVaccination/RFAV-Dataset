Generally the references were incidental, but a few were either directly to questions, or in the context of medical lectures. Further, many of his anthroposophical remedies had preventative uses. This book includes every reference to vaccines in the Collected Works, and also contextual material to help the reader understand how Steiner approached the topic. All of these indications are present in this book in fresh translations. This volume is an helpful background material for people looking to understand the medical, ethical, and moral implications of vaccination in light of anthroposophy. Collected in this book are all of Rudolf Steiner's statements on vaccination. Spanning over twenty five years, these extended excerpts are drawn from 15 separate volumes of the Collected Works. Several of these statements have never before been published in English. Newly translated from the latest German editions, they serve as an invaluable resource for anyone interested in exploring Steiner's views on the topic of vaccination.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe's scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner's multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland. "}
