Visualize a warm summer day, the sun is shining, the skies are blue, and you are out in nature, hiking a beautiful forest trail. You see tall tree canopies above you, lush green epiphytes growing on the tall tree barks, the damp smell of the earth, with dark green moss growing on it, funguses and mushrooms growing at the base of the old thick exposed barks of the trees, critters and squirrels foraging the earth, the crisp, cool air under the canopies, and the sun rays shining through the tall trees. You hear a gentle stream running across the trail, you see wild orchids and trilliums, you smell the fresh sweet scent of blooming wildflowers. Ahhh. as you let that breath out, all the stressors of life, relationships, work, living in urban dwellings melt away. This is essence is what I would call North American Forest Bathing. What is Eco - Therapy? Nature therapy or eco-therapy encompasses a group of natural techniques and treatments involving nature in order to better one's overall health. A lot of the unique lodges of the National Geographic seem to capture this essence of Eco-Therapy such as [Mashpi Lodge](https://www.mashpilodge.com/) in Ecuador. An individual's mental or physical health can be improved with their presence outdoors. The design for ecotherapy is based in the connection to the earth and the earth's self-righting and complex systems of balance. An individual's ability to harmonize with these systems aids in improving mental health. Our current and popular custom of taking vacations where we often travel to tropical places, national parks, cottage country, or camping sites, speaks to some evidence that we rejoice in such environments in order to feel relaxed. Traditionally, time spent outdoors was a common part of everyday life. Since the industrial revolution and the creation of the modern civilization we have lost touch with nature. As a consequence of industrial growth there now exists an addition of pollution, crowded cities and a lack of wide-open green spaces, a connection to the earth, and physical activity, leading to a less healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, we have become wired to our screens and addicted to fast foods, often feeling tired and nerve shaken. An Australian professor coined the term psychoterratica, to define the state of mental well-being and the trauma caused by distance from nature. Nature therapy is much more than a recently revived health trend. Forest bathing is a practice that is decades old, first coined by the Japanese as shinrin-yoku which means \"taking in the forest\". In the 1980s, the Japanese government began noticing the negative effects of the tech boom on city dwellers such as depression, fatigue and distraction. Citizens were prescribed to spend more time in rural environments to improve their well-being. Forest bathing is an integral part of Japanese medicine used for healing and preventative health care. The concept, however, has been circulated in many cultures for ages. A considerable amount of scientific research regarding the relationship between health and nature has proven many benefits for the mind, body and spirit. The effects of forest bathing and nature therapy has been analyzed for a long time. The Japanese government has funded 4 million dollars since 2004 for forest bathing research. Spending time in nature lowers cortisol levels (a stress hormone) and prompts parasympathetic nervous system activity responsible for rest and slowing down heart rate. Stress plays a role in many maladies such as headaches, high blood pressure, heart problems, diabetes, and skin conditions. In one study conducted by psychologist Terry Hartig, participants who walked through nature for a period of time reported more positive emotions over those who performed other activities within an urban setting. Another case is a 2007 study where 50% of an increase in levels of natural killer cells (immune system cells) was exhibited in participants who spent two hours walking through a forest over a two-day period. These positive effects lasted well after the trip. Trees and plants release antimicrobial compounds called phytoncides that are meant to protect from germs. The effect of the essential oils secreted by trees on human immune function significantly increases natural killer cells activity. Natural killer cells are important for fighting diseases as they attack infected cells. Phytoncide exposure not only improves immune system function but also uplifts mood and reduces anxiety and blood pressure. Experiencing the organic essential oils directly from the source positively impacts people due to their wide range of benefits. Depending on the type of vegetation provided by your chosen location for forest bathing you can encounter these clean scents naturally. The sweet floral scents from plants like lavender promotes relaxation as it reduces stress and anxiety and improves sleep. Another example includes the musky scents of pine, cedarwood, sandalwood, balsam fir, tea tree etc. Some of these have wonderful preventative antiseptic properties, provide relief from inflammation or improve concentration. Forest therapy or forest bathing is not just a regular hike on a trail. Walking through the terrain is only a part of the practice and it provides a great source of physical activity important to health. Connecting to the earth and its complex systems assists in creating a natural balance for the body and mind. The idea of forest bathing is to have a mindful experience with nature similar to meditation. You can go to any forest, park, conservation area or provincial park and without any destination in mind walk under the canopy of trees or sit and reflect. Take your time to find peace with the land, become fully immersed in the environment. Breath in the fresh scents, feel the earth and relax. Try it with a guide or explore on your own. Forest bathing is the most accessible treatment. Currently there is a Global Institute for Forest Therapy. Japan now has 62 designated therapeutic woods. Finland's tourism is advertised as the forest bathing destination. There are forest therapy guides and certification programs throughout the United Kingdom and North America such as the Association of Nature and Forest Therapy Guides and Programs. Here in Canada we are privileged with a wide expanse of natural reserves and parks to explore. When you begin your gentle path to wellness remember to respect the natural balance of the "}
