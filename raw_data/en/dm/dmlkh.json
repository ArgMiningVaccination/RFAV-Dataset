Including the Tianjie Dental 'Falcon'. Problem Action Testing by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) has revealed that the Tianjie Dental Falcon device lacks sufficient shielding in the X-ray tube, which could give rise to high patient doses and under typical high radiographic workloads result in operator doses in excess of the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999 annual dose limits. This could give rise to adverse health effects caused by radiation. The Tianjie Dental Falcon is not CE-marked as a medical device. Action by Dentists, Medical Physics Departments Identify and stop using this and similar non CE-marked devices. Replace the device with a suitable CE- marked alternative. Be aware of the NRPB (HPA) Guidance Notes for Dental Practitioners on the Safe Use of X-Ray Equipment or the Medical & Dental Guidance Notes published by IPEM. Be aware of the general requirement to consult a suitable radiation protection adviser with regard to the use of X-ray equipment. Be aware of MHRA advice on the use of non-CE marked devices .
