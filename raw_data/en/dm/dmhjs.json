However, the evidence presented in this report does not meet the criteria of the National Register of Historic Places for determin ing them eligible for the Register as a Traditional Cultural Property (TCP). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page i ABSTRACT During 2005, Summit Envirosolutions, In c. and Two Pines Resource Group, LLC, completed an ethnographic resources study of the former U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center (TCRC) property in Hennepin County, Minnesota. This work was performed under contract with the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). The NPS, through its Mississippi National River a nd Recreation Area (MNRRA) office, is overseeing the National Envir onmental Policy Act (NEPA) pl anning process on behalf of the U.S. Department of the Interior. The goa l of this public pla nning process is to identify and evaluate alternative disposition options for the TCRC property. This process includes the completion of an environmental impact statement (EIS) that will consider disposition alternatives and th e potential impacts of alternative future uses of the TCRC property on the natural, histor ic, and cultural resources with in the property's boundaries. The primary objectives of the ethnographi c resources study were to identify the relationships of American Indians with the land, natural resources, and cultural resources located within the boundaries of the 27.32- acre TCRC property, an d to explore and document such affiliations, if present, be they precontact, historical, or contemporary. Particular emphasis was placed on the identific ation and documentation of any natural or cultural ethnographic resources present on the property that are cons idered traditionally meaningful by Dakota or Ojibwe people as conveyed to us by our interviewees. Identified ethnographic resources were evalua ted for their eligibil ity for listing in the National Register of Hist oric Places (National Register) as traditional cultural properties (TCPs) within the context of American Indian history within the State of Minnesota and contemporary cultural use and to determine their status as Sacred Site s. Results will be incorporated into the EIS for the TCRC property. This study consisted of consultation, archival research, and interviews. Official responses to consultation were received from all four of the federally-recognized Dakota communities in Minnesota (Lower Sioux In dian Community, Prairie Island Indian Community, Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Community, Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, and the Upper Sioux Indian Community), and one Minnesota Ojibwe (White Earth Band of Chippewa) community. Twenty thre e individuals were interviewed for this study including 11 official fede rally recognized tribal repr esentatives including at least one individual representing each of the above-mentioned communities, 7 key cultural experts (6 Dakota and 1 Ojibwe ), and 5 other informants wi th knowledge of the history and past use of the TCRC property. Coldwater Spring has been identified during the course of this study as a natural spring that is culturally significant for its association with: \u0083 the Mdote area at the confluence of the Minneso ta and Mississippi rivers, which is regarded as the center of all things and historically significant by the Mdewakanton Dakota; \u0083 the activity of collecting spri ng water for ceremonial use. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page ii This study concludes that Coldwater Spring is an ethnographically significant natural resource associated with Dakota and Ojibwe tr aditions that use natural spring water, such as the Inipi . Natural springs, like Coldwater, are regarded as vital to the continued practice of these traditions, which have been practiced by these traditional groups for at least two generations, a nd that are regarded as integral to their continued existence as ethnically distinct peoples. Based on the findings of this study, Coldwate r Spring is recommended as eligible for the National Register under Criterion A for its association with th e Dakota cultural landscape of Mdote , which for the Mdewakanton Dakota is the center of the earth, or Makoce Cokaya Kin , and, in one belief, is also the point of their creation. The cultural importance of the Mdote area is reflected in the number of known and named Dakota cultural properties within the vicinity of the conflu ence. Coldwater Spring is also recommended as eligible for the National Re gister under Criterion C as repr esentative of a resource type of natural springs, many of which have been destroyed or which are no longer accessible, that are an integral component in the pr actice of Dakota tradi tional ceremonies and lifeways that require pure spring water. In addition, it has been comm unicated to the authors of this study by an official representative of a federally recognized Dakota tribe that Coldwater Spring is a Sacred Site. In light of these conclusions, Summit Envi rosolutions, Inc. and Two Pines Resource Group, LLC recommend continued consultation with Dakota and Ojibwe communities regarding the future of the TCRC property. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page iii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We extend our appreciation and respect to the Dakota and Ojibwe and non-native people who took the time to share their traditional knowledge, stories, thoughts, ideas, and feelings with us about the pl ace where the former U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center (TCRC) is now located. Some had to drive many miles and many had to take time away from important priorities in order to speak with us . We were honored by the opportunity to listen and learn - and we were moved by what we heard. We are grateful that so many came forward with th eir voices which will shape the future of the property. For this, we are thankful to the following people (listed in alphabetical order): Scott Anfinson; Jim Anderson; Schommer; Michael Swan; Leonard Wabasha; Bruce White, and Joe Williams. The traditional knowledge that was shared by the interviewees is the foundation of this report. The synthesis, analys is, and recommendations made in this report are based on this traditional knowledge along with relevant hi storical research. It is our intent and hope that this report presents traditional knowledge in a respectfu l and meaningful way and that the analysis and recommendations that are made based on traditional knowledge honor the thoughts, ideas, feelings, and expe riences of the Dakota and Ojibwe people with whom we worked. We extend our gratitude to John Anfinson, Kim Berns, Mike Evans, and JoAnn Kyral for the opportunity to complete this study and a ssist the National Park Service by providing information for the ethnographic co mponent of their EIS process. We acknowledge the complication of evalua ting American Indian experiences and perspectives using non-native standards, langua ge, and procedures. We anticipate that this project and report will be one more st epping stone towards working collaboratively and creating common tools for talking abou t the future of places of importance to American Indian people.

(Summit) and Two Pines Resource Group, LLC (Two Pines), completed an ethnographic re sources study of the former U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center (T CRC) property in Hennepi n County, Minnesota. This work was performed under contract with the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). The NPS, through its Mississippi National River and Recreation Area (MNRRA) office, is overseeing the National Envir onmental Policy Act (NEPA) pl anning process on behalf of the U.S. Department of the Interior. The goa l of this public pla nning process is to identify and evaluate alternative disposition options for the TCRC property. This process includes the completion of an environmental impact statement (EIS) that will consider disposition alternatives and th e potential impacts of alternative future uses of the TCRC property on the natural, histor ic, and cultural resources w ithin property's boundaries. While historical and archaeol ogical studies of the TCRC prop erty have been conducted in the past, studies contributing American Indi an perspectives on this property and its resources have not yet been completed. Therefore, the primary purpose of the ethnographic resources study was to identify Am erican Indian connections to the land and the natural and cultural resources located within the boundaries of the TCRC property, and to document those relationships, if present, be they precontact, historical, or contemporary, through tribal consultation, archiv al research, and interviews. Particular emphasis was placed on the identification and documentation of natural or cultural ethnographic resources present on the proper ty that are consid ered traditionally meaningful by American Indians as conveyed to us by our interviewees. Identified resources were then evaluated for their eligib ility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (National Register) as tr aditional cultural properties (TCPs). Furthermore, identified resources were evalua ted within the context of each traditional group's history, as well as cont emporary cultural use in order to determine their status as Sacred Sites. More specifically, the objectives of the study were to: 1. Document the presence/absence of ethnohi storic and ethnographic resources: Are there features or natural resources on the property that are traditionally meaningful within American Indian cultural systems? 2. Document the presence/absence of TCPs: Is the ethnographic resource(s) eligible for inclusion in the National Register because of its association with cultural practices or beliefs of contemporary Dakota and/or Ojibwe people that are (a) rooted in that community's history, and (b) important in maintaining the continuing cultural identity of the community? 3. Document presence/absence of Sacred S ite(s): Is the ethnographic resource a specific, discrete, narrowly delineated lo cation on Federal land that is identified U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 2 by a federally recognized Indian tribe or Indian individual determined to be an appropriately authoritative representative of an Indian re ligion, as sacred by virtue of its established religious significan ce to, or ceremonial use by, an Indian religion (provided that the tribe or appropr iately authoritative representative of and Indian religion has informed the agency of the existence of such a site)? 4. If present, document the boundaries of ethnohistoric/ethnographic resources, TCPs, and/or Sacred Sites. The results of this study will be incorporat ed into the EIS for the TCRC property and will provide the NPS with a planning tool for dete rmining the appropriate future land use and management of the TCRC property. PROJECT TEAM Michelle Terrell, Ph.D. , of Two Pines, has over fifteen years of professional experience conducting cultural resource stud ies in Minnesota and the U pper Midwest. Dr. Terrell has conducted two previous evaluations of traditional Dakota cultural resources in Minnesota ( Oheywahe /Pilot Knob and Wakan Tipi /Carver's Cave), and has participated in tribal consultation with the Minnesota Indian Affairs Council (MIAC) and the four federally-recognized Dakota tribes in Minnesota. Dr. Terrell served as the Principal Investigator for this study and her responsib ilities included participating in all of the interviews, conducting archival research, anal yzing and synthesizing data, and authoring portions of this research report. Mollie O'Brien, M.A., of Summit, has over fourteen years of experience in cultural resources consultation in Minnesota and the Upper Midwest. Ms. O'Brien has worked collaboratively with American Indian repr esentatives on numerous cultural resource projects including interv iews and consultation, archival research (relating to TCPs and cultural landscapes), archaeological research, survey and excavation, collections research and analysis, and burial m ound preservation work (i ncluding research, mapping, geophysical investigation, authen tication and recovery). Ms. O'Brien served as Project Manager for this study and her responsibilitie s included tribal coor dination, organizing the interviews, participating in ten of the tw elve interviews, analyz ing data, and authoring portions of this research report. Penny Rucks, M.A. , of Summit, is an anthropologi st who has been engaged in ethnography and consultation with American Indians since 1994 when she was appointed the Tribal Relations Coordinator while Mana ger of the Heritage Resource Program for the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit of the USDA Forest Service (1989-1997). Ms. Rucks has designed and conducted applied research to document a variety of ethnohistoric properties, ethnogr aphic places, and TCPs in co llaboration with Washoe, Northern Paiute, and Western Shoshone people. She has written about her approach to ethnographic research in the applied field of federal cultural resource management (Rucks 1999). Ms. Rucks served as Ethnographic Cons ultant for this study and she was available for consultation throughout the proj ect, participated in five of the twelve U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 3 interviews, authored portions of this resear ch report, and reviewed and commented on the drafts of this report. Andrea Vermeer, M.A. , of Summit, has over eleven years of experience in cultural resources consultation in the Upper Midwest and Southwest. Ms. Vermeer's extensive experience includes serving as historian on numerous projects involving archival research, the development of historical cont exts, and determinations of eligibility for cultural resources. Ms. Vermeer conducted archiv al research, participated in one of the interviews, authored portions of this resear ch report, and provided quality control on the drafts of this report. The curricula vitae of these team members can be found in Appendix A of this report. REPORT STRUCTURE Camp Coldwater, the location of a military encampment during the construction of Fort Snelling (1820-c.1822) and the s ite of a subsequent EuroAmer ican settlement, has long been recognized as a place of historical sign ificance for its role in the nascence of the state of Minnesota. Within recent years, Coldwater Spring, which was associated with Camp Coldwater and is located within the TCRC property, has also been described as culturally important to Dakota and Ojibwe comm unities. The purpose of this study is to apply federal standards for judging cultural and historical significance to Coldwater Spring and additional ethnograp hic resources within the TCRC property. The U.S. Department of the Interior has developed crit eria for judging the eligibility of cultural resources for listing in the National Regi ster (NPS 2002). Furthermore, the U.S. Department of the Interior has created a bulletin that provides guidelines for the application of these criteria to TCPs (Par ker and King 1998). These processes include the following steps: (1) identification of the historic contexts associated with the property; (2) classification of the property as a district, si te, building, structure, object, TCP and/or cultural/historic landscape; (3) evaluation of the property's significance under National Register Criteria A, B, C, and D; (4) determination of whether the property represents a type of property excl uded from the National Register because of Criteria Considerations; and (5) assessment of the property's hi storical integrity. The following report describes the research de sign, findings, analysis and evaluation, and recommendations of this study. PROJECT LOCATION The TCRC project area is a 27.32- acre (11.06-hectare) area locat ed in the NW \u00bc of the SE \u00bc; the W \u00bd of the NE \u00bc; and the E \u00bd of the NW \u00bc of Section 20 of Township 28N, Range 23W (Figure 1). The UTM (NAD 27, Zone 15) coordinates of the project area are as follows: northeast corner - 484583E 4971848N; southeast corner - 484713E 4971292N; southwest 4971844N; north-central point - 4971921N. These coordinates were determined electronically using TopoZone (www.topozone.com). Project Location United States Bureau of Mines - TCRC Project Location Ethnographic Resources Study Figure 1Hennepin County, Minnesota N Saint Paul West Quadrangle, Minnesota (1993) (USGS 7.5 Minute Series) 0 miles 0.5 U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 5 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The TCRC ethnographic resources study included the development of a site-specific cultural context and the identification of present ethnographic resources through tribal and agency consultation, the collection of oral histories and oral tr aditions, a nd extensive documentary research. The methods fo r this study are described below. Work was conducted in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation (NPS 2002). Consultation procedures followed Ethnographic Resource Protection and Consultation with Traditionally Associated Peopl es: A Desk Reference Manual (Watson and Evans 2003), and evaluation procedures followed the NPS Guidelines for Evaluating and Documenting Traditional Cultural Properties (National Register Bulletin 38) (Parker and King 1998). Ethnographic methods for conducting fieldwork and presentation of findings follow an approach articulated by Erik Lassite r (2004; 2005a; 2005b) as Collaborative Ethnography. (Lassiter (2004) was expanded in to a fuller treatment that was recently published as a text (2005a). It is cited here as the most recent publication on this methodology.) COLLABORATIVE ETHNOGRAPHIC METHODOLOGY Collaboration is an explicit approach and methodology applie d systematically throughout the process of gathering and presenting cu ltural knowledge. Lassite r (2005b:84) defines this approach as \"the collaboration of researchers and subject s in the production of ethnographic texts, both fieldwork and writing.\" Lassiter identifies six strategies for practic ing collaborative ethnogr aphy. He promotes working with (1) principle consultants as readers and editors; (2) focus groups; (3) editorial boards; (4) collaborative (5) (L assiter 2005b:84). Alt hough co-writing texts is not always feasible, \"when taken seriously and applied systematically rather than bureaucratically, any one or a combination of these strategies leads from...a clich\u00e9d collaborative ethnography to a more deliber ate and explicit coll aborative ethnography that more immediately engages the public s with which we work\" (Lassiter 2005b:96). These methods are appropriate whenever fi ndings, or \"ethnographic texts,\" lead to actions that will affect the community. Bu t Lassiter suggests this approach may have broader application and in fact, produce mo re accurate texts and representations of cultural \"facts\" that represent a community. Clearly, they have application anytime consensus is important for community action, or in the event the cultural heritage or traditional culture of a community is represente d by or to outsiders as in museum exhibits or the identification of TCPS. The identification of TCPs is predicated on collaboration and m eaningful consultation since TCPs can only be identified, and integrity determined, by the communities that U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 6 value them (Parker and King 1998). However, as the authors of National Register Bulletin 38 consistently acknowledge, in the case of American Indians, enclosing cultural places within boundaries and applying non- native categories of significance are frequently incompatible with traditional wa ys of ascribing signifi cance (e.g., King 2003). As a result, collaboration ofte n ends with identification, and the community is left out of the analyses and evaluation pha se. Without further input fr om the affected communities, cultural knowledge can be inadvertently distorted as it is \"fit\" into standardized categories. It is essential to note that using collaborative methods of identifying and evaluating TCPs does not mean that all ethnographic places valued by communities will meet standards (National Register criteria) imposed by the process, rather that: (1) the findings (the \"texts\") accurately reflect th e cultural meanings imbedded in the cultural knowledge (the \"data\") shared; and (2) the evaluation proces s is clear to the community. From the community's point of view: Were they heard? Was the process fair? What did they learn about the process? What were the benefits of participation? Would they do it again? From the researcher-agency point of view: Were short-term management objectives met? Was/were the communities represented? What did they learn about the community and the process? How would they do it again? The TCRC research team worked within this framework of collabo rative ethnography in a continuously interactive mode with members of Dakota and Ojibwe communities. Fieldwork was modeled on principles and techniques developed for community-based participatory assessments conducted by ethnogr aphers in other fields of applied anthropology (e.g, Bernard, 2006:352). The study employed semi-structured interviews, which allow for face-to-face, two-way convers ations focused on specific topics (e.g., the role of springs) (Handwerker 2001:80, 121,124). This interview method is best described in guidelines established by the Food and Ag riculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and is further explored in the inte rview methods section of this report (Cole 1990), Interviews encouraged two-way conversation and questions about the process and objectives, as well as cultural content. Initial interviews in particular were focused on 1) refining the objectives and the scope of the enquiry; 2) work ing out information gathering and sharing logistics and procedures; 3) refining interview topics; and 4) identifying additional interviewees. Prior to the interview process a set of themes and associated potential interview questions were developed by the research team (see page 13). These were sent to all the community representativ es and perspective interviewees as talking points for the group meeting and to provide a baseline for the team and the participants as well as a flexible framework for the interviews. The goal was to encourage individuals to sh are in their own terms what is known about the TCRC property and how it figures (or not) in their history, pa st traditions, and contemporary community life. As the study progressed, consistencies began to emerge from these contributions that led to new t opics. From these, culturally meaningful U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 7 themes were developed for the evaluation pha se of the study. This inductive process is referred to by social scientists as gr ounded-theory (e.g, Bernard 2006:492). Findings, theories, or in this case, cultural meanings emerge from the data, from the ground-up, as opposed to theories that are tested from the top-down in the deductive method. Furthermore, conclusions are refined in an iterative process with follow-up, review and comment by the interviewees. This report is written with a collaborative approach to the presentation of the findings by including \"the ethnographic text\" that provide s the basis for the evaluation of Coldwater Spring by: 1) relying on and hi ghlighting direct quotes so or iginal voices are heard and potential misrepresentation by researchers is avoided, 2) affording interviewees opportunities to review and comment on their original contributi ons as well as the researchers' subsequent analysis and recommendations, and 3) acknowledging the traditional knowledge that was shared and the subsequent comments and contributions to researchers' evaluations and recommendations. A tenet of the collaborative a pproach is that an interact ive exchange produces more accurate representations. In addition, both the researcher and the communities benefit from the process and are more likely to enga ge in similar projects in the future. The exchange of knowledge itself benefits both partners, which is a goal of successful collaborative projects (e.g. Rucks 1999:248). Th is report is written not only to achieve identification and evaluation of ethnographic places, TCPs, or Sacred Sites, but to contribute to the communities, in exchange, some information regarding the status of academic understanding of their historie s, specifically rela ting to the region encompassing the TCRC property. This study wa s designed also to contribute to long- term productive relationships among the stakeh olders responsible in their various ways for the care of cultural places: the communities for whom they hold traditional meaning, the academic community who document these values, and the agencies and land managers with jurisdiction. OFFICIAL TRIBAL INTERACTIONS In keeping with standard government-to-govern ment consultation prot ocols, all contacts with tribal representatives were made thr ough official tribal government channels. The NPS initiated official interactions with tribal governments through a formal letter explaining the purpose of the ethnographic study, requesting information regarding the project area, and asking for assistance in id entifying individuals who may be willing to share information regarding their knowledge of the area (Appendix B). Letters were sent to all of the federally recognized Dakota and Ojibwe communities in Minnesota; communities that had previously commented on Coldwater Spring; or communities that were recommended by the MIAC and/or the NPS. Letters were sent by the NPS to the following communities: U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 8 Bois Forte Reservation, Minnesota Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, South Dakota Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe, South Dakota Fond du Lac Reservation, Minnesota Grand Portage Reservation, Minnesota Ho-Chunk Nation, Wisconsin Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma, Oklahoma Lac Courte Oreilles, Wisconsin Leech Lake Reservation, Minnesota Lower Sioux Community, Minnesota Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, Minnesota Minnesota Indian Affairs Council, Minnesota Prairie Island Indian Community, Minnesota Red Lake Band of Ojibwe, Minnesota Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska, Nebraska Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Community, Minnesota Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate, South Dakota Spirit Lake Sioux Nation, North Dakota Upper Sioux Community, Minnesota White Earth Reservation, Minnesota Winnebago of Nebraska, Nebraska In following up to the introductory letters to tribal governments, NPS staff conducted phone calls to confirm that a letter was r eceived and to inquire about whether a key representative was designated by the community (Appendix B). As a result of this consultation, the following federally rec ognized tribal governments requested to participate in the ethnographic study: Dakota Lower Sioux Indian Community, Minnesota Prairie Island Indian Community, Minnesota Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Community, Minnesota Upper Sioux Indian Community, Minnesota Ojibwe White Earth Band of Chippewa, Minnesota Ms. O'Brien of Summit followed up with phone calls to these communities to introduce the project team and the ethnographic project , answer questions about the study, and determine their level of intere st and the preferred approach to information gathering. During these phone calls, Ms. O'Brien also id entified potentia l interviewees and planned field visits, meetings, and interviews. Thes e preliminary contacts, along with information sent by e-mail (Appendix B), served as a catalyst for community members to begin thinking about the project, the place, and the traditional knowledge ava ilable. The intent of these initial conversations was to esta blish rapport between the research team and U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 9 members of the Dakota and Ojibwe communitie s and potential interviewees who would participate in the project. Key communica tions were documented in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Appendix C). INTERVIEWEES Official Representatives of Federa lly Recognized Tribal Governments Initial interviews were conducted with individuals from the federally recognized tribal communities that responded to the consultation initiated by the NPS. All of the federally recognized Dakota communities in Minnesota , as well as one Minnesota Ojibwe community, requested to participate in this study. These communities identified the following elected officers or cultural appointees to serve as official representatives for initial interviews: Dakota Lower Sioux Indian Community, Minnesota Bob Larsen, Vice President, Commu nity Council (at time of interview) Prairie Island Indian Community, Minnesota Craig Wills, Director, Department of Natural Resources Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Community, Minnesota Leonard Wabasha, Cultural Resources Director Upper Sioux Indian Community, Minnesota Elitta (Lorraine) Gouge, Secretary, Board of Trustees Dallas Ross, Director of Environm ental Programs, Office of Environment Tom Ross, Member at Large, Board of Trustees Ojibwe White Earth Band of Chippewa, Minnesota Andy Favorite, Tribal Historian Tom McCauley, Tribal Hi storic Preservation Officer Michael Swan, Director of Natural Resources Two of the Dakota communities (Prairie Island Indian Community and Upper Sioux Indian Community) also designated tribal members to serve as official tribal representatives and informants for this study: Dakota Prairie Island Indian Community, Minnesota Curtis Campbell, elder, tribal historian, and former tribal chairman Upper Sioux Indian Community, Minnesota Carrie Schommer, elder and reti red Dakota language instructor U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 10 Key Cultural Experts Beginning with the official representatives, the interv iew pool took on aspects of a network sample as tribal members suggested key cultural expe rts and other interviewees and contacts thought to be especially knowledgeable about the study area and associated traditions. Those persons recognized as key cultu ral experts were li mited to persons identified by members of their own tribes as having traditional knowledge about their tribal traditions (i.e ., Dakota elders recommended by Dakot a tribal members). Particular attention was given to identifying native language-speaking elders with traditional knowledge. Some of the Dakota in terviewees, for example, were ask\u00e9, or first-born sons, who were raised by their grandparents in order to learn directly from their elders' traditional Dakota beliefs and practices that they in turn are to impart to their grandchildren. Interviewees that belonged to the category of key cultural experts included: Dakota Gary Cavender, elder and Dakota speaker residing at Shakopee community Chris Leith, Prairie Island Indian Community, Minnesota Edward Red Owl, Sisseton-Wahpe ton Sioux Tribe, South Dakota Michael Selvage, Sr., Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, South Dakota Joe Williams, Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, South Dakota Everett Black Thunder, Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin (formerly Sisseton- Wahpeton Sioux Tribe) Ojibwe Eddie Benton-Banai, Lac Courte Or eilles Ojibwe Community, Wisconsin Other Interviewees and Contacts The consultants also contacted and/or in terviewed members of Dakota and Ojibwe communities, non federally recognized tribal me mbers; previous researchers; and other individuals with information a bout the project area. Interv iewees that belonged to the category of Other Interview ees and Contact included: Carolyn Anderson, Associate Professor of Anthropology, St Olaf College Jim Anderson, Tribal Historian, Me ndota Mdewakanton Dakota Community Scott Anfinson, National Regi Dalsin, Preserve Coalition Day, Bois Forte Band of Chippewa, Minnesota Alan Downer, Department Manager, Nava jo Nation Historic Preservation Dept. Pat Emerson, Head, Department of Archaeology, MHS Jim Jones, Minnesota Indian Affairs Council Tom King, co-author of Nati onal Register Bulletin 38 Bruce Koenen, Office of the State Archaeologist Jim Olson, Former U.S. Bureau of Mines employee Tom Sanders, Site Manager, Jeffers Petroglyphs, MHS U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 11 Michael Scott, Mendota Md ewakanton Dakota Community Bruce White, EthnoHistorian, Turnstone Historical Research A complete list of interviewees, their associations, and brief biographies is included in Appendix D. INTERVIEW METHODS Oral interviews began in June of 2005 and c ontinued intermittently through November of that year. A total of twelve interviews were conducted for this study. Dr. Terrell and Ms. O'Brien conducted six of the interviews; Dr. Terrell, Ms. O' Brien and Ms. Rucks conducted three of the interviews; Dr. Terre ll and Ms. Rucks conducted two of the interviews; and Dr. Terrell, Ms. O'Brie n and Ms. Vermeer conducted one of the interviews. Lengthy semi-structured interviews were the primary research tool with the focus of the interviews being to engage partic ipants in meaningful dialogue regarding the former TCRC property and the la nd, and natural and cultural resources important to them and to their community. Semi-s tructured interviews are well -suited to this undertaking, because they allow for focused, conversational, two-way communication around a variety of topics. Ms. O'Brien coordinated and facilitated the interview process. The study team conducted interviews from one to seven hours in lengt h. Five interviews were conducted with individuals and seven were group interviews co nducted with as few as two people and as many as seven participants. Some individuals were present at more than one interview. We conducted semi-structured interviews w ith a total of 23 pe ople: 7 official representatives of federally recognized Dakot a communities; 3 official representatives of federally recognized Ojibwe communities; 6 Da kota key cultural expe rts; 1 Ojibwe key cultural expert; 6 other interviewees. Interview dates, locations, and participants are listed in Appendix E. Open-ended conversations lasting from about 30 minutes to an hour about the ethnographic study were also held with two more American Indian individuals including a representative from the Minnesota Indian Affairs Council (MIAC). A brief telephone interview was also conducted with Jim Olson, a former U.S. Bureau of Mines employee. The locations of the interviews were at the discretion of the interv iewees, and either took place at their home, on site, at the tribal community, at Summit's office in St. Paul, or another location of their choosi ng. To orient interviewees to the project area, copies of the general site map and general locat ion map available on the MNRRA website (www.nps.gov/miss/bom/property.html) were brought to each of the interviews. It was anticipated that the interview pr ocess would be dynamic and variable to accommodate interviewees from a wide range of backgrounds and perspectives in variable settings that would invite their contributions. The interv iews were open-ended and semi-structured around the interview them es and sample questions provided to them as a guide. In addition to note taking, some of the interv iews were documented through audio tape. The audio files (a nd transcriptions, when made) were sent for verification to U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 12 the interviewees, as were the summaries and write-ups presented in this report. Permission to record interviews was granted with the provision that the tapes and transcriptions were the property of the interviewee, and the discretion to disclose content was up to them. Lodging and mileage was paid for interviewees w ho had to travel, and we typically provided meals whil e we were meeting together. Interview Themes Semi-structured interviews were designed to collect information not only on ethnographic resources within the TCRC property, but also on associations with the confluence area, the use and importance of spri ngs, and traditional practices involving spring wa ter. Prior to the interview process a set of themes and associated potential interview questions were developed by the consultants to address th ese anticipated interview topics. These research questions provide an open framework for facilitating and encouraging interviewees to discuss and share traditio nal knowledge. These themes and sample questions were sent to all the community repr esentatives and perspective interviewees as talking points for the interviews. The or der, specific wording, and level to which questions were asked depended on the flow of the interview and the comfort and willingness for the interviewees to share info rmation. Similarly, not all questions that were asked during the interview process were designed or phrased ahead of time, but rather additional questions were formulat ed during the interview in response to information offered. This aspect of the semi-structured interview process allows the interviewer and interviewee the flexibility to go into further detail in particular areas warranting more in depth discussion (Cole 1990). The themes and guideline questions that were identified prior to the interview process are presented below: History, Stories, and Personal Associations \u0083 What do you know about this place in the history of your family/community/people? Did they use this place? \u0083 Tell me about the first time you heard about this place (Who told you, how old were you, what season, and on what occasi on. What did you hear about it?) \u0083 Are there certain historic figures associated with this place? \u0083 Are there (historical) events associated w ith this place? With Coldwater Spring? Who was involved, what happened and where? \u0083 Are there stories about Dakota/Ojibwe-white relations at this place? At Camp Coldwater? At Fort Snelling? Did Da kota/Ojibwe people ever camp near \"Camp Coldwater?\" \u0083 Have you taught/told anyone about this place? If so, what important things have you taught them?

If so, in what way? \u0083 What are the between Maka Yusota (Boiling Springs) and Coldwater Spring? \u0083 What do springs mean to your community - to you? \u0083 Are springs important places? In what way are springs important places? \u0083 Is Coldwater Spring an important pl ace? If so, why this spring? \u0083 How do springs differ from other 'water' pl aces? What is the role of water? \u0083 What is the origin of Coldwater Spring? Springs in general? \u0083 Is there a beginning or end of a spring (boundaries)? Of Coldwater Spring? Contemporary Meaning/Use/Integrity \u0083 What does this place mean to your community/you? \u0083 Have you visited this do/did you visit? \u0083 did visit? When did you first visit?

In what way? \u0083 Would you/your lifeway s be impacted by how this place is eventually managed and used? \u0083 Would this property be an importa nt place regardless of the spring? Informed Consent and Confidentiality Establishing a foundation of tr ust and ethical intera ction served as a ba sis for meaningful dialogue between the research te am and the interviewees. The team discussed the intent of the ethnographic resources study with the interviewe es, and how the study and interviews would be conducted in a collabor ative manner with opportunity to review and amend interviewee input. The research t eam discussed with interviewees how their contributions would be incorporated into th e overall research, and how the interviewees' contributions would be temporarily stored at Summit and then returned back to the interviewee upon completi on of the report. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 14 In order to address possible concerns re garding the confidentiality of traditional knowledge and appropriate documentation of the property and related stories and traditions, a procedure for confidentiality wa s prepared at the beginning of the study. This procedure consisted of: (1) returning audio files back to the interviewees at the completion of the study; and (2) requesting author ization to use relevant quotes in the text of the report (this was done by sending the transcribed audi o excerpt to the associated interviewee along with a consent form authoriz ing the use of the quot e in the report). Collaborative Review Process Periodically during the interview, the ethnographic team repeat ed back what was heard to confirm that the information was heard and r ecorded correctly, provi ding the interviewee a chance to make clarifications when appropr iate. Following the interview, relevant passages were included and discussed in the re port by the authors. Project interviewees were sent a transcript or compact disc contai ning their entire interv iew and a copy of the initial draft report in order to obtain their au thorization to use the passages and to obtain comments, feedback and further input. Acco mpanying this submission was a request that the interviewee review the re port and provide comments a nd feedback on deletions or additions that they would like to have made, as well as a signature form for permission to use their name and quotations (Appendix F). This protocol was established prior to the interviews in order to provide confidentiality to the interviewees, was communicated to the interviewees at the beginning of the interv iew, and was reiterated at the conclusion of the interview session. At the ti me that the draft sections we nt to the inte rviewees, an initial draft report was submitted to the NPS. This initial draft did not contain the names of interviewees. Each interviewee, who had been sent a draft repor t, received a follow-up phone call in order to ensure that the information pres ented accurately conveye d their contributions and the cultural knowledge represented in a respect ful and honorable way. ARCHIVAL RESEARCH This project included archival research that focused on the site-specific history of the TCRC property, broader research on the history of the confluence area in general, and the examination of ethnohistorical and ethnograp hic information on the Dakota and Ojibwe occupants of the region. Additional research was done to develop an historic context of American Indians within Minnesota within whic h to evaluate the significance of cultural resources identified on the property. This re search entailed the examination of available primary and secondary sources at the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), Office of the State Archaeologist (OSA), Minnesota Historical Society (MHS), the University of Minnesota's Borchert Map Library, and th e electronic catalogs of the Library of Congress and the National Archives. Previous Oral and Written Testimon ies and Tribal Consultation In 1998, during the Trunk Highway (TH) 55 Reroute project, public testimony and written affidavits were submitted by Dakota and Ojibwe community members in U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 15 response to that project. Offi cial tribal statements were also submitted. While comments from this period may have been influenced by the debate surrounding the TH 55 reroute, many of the statements refer to features asso ciated with the current study area. Therefore these testimonies and affidavits were reviewe d, and information from these sources, all of which are public, was incorporated into the results section of this report. When cited, these documents are identified as originatin g during the TH 55 rero ute project. Tribal comments from this process are included in an appendix to this document (Appendix G). In conjunction with former plans for the TC RC property, the tribal consultation process was previously initiated in 1999. Tribal comments from this process were reviewed and are included as an appendix to this document (Appendix G). Previous Archaeological and Historical Studies Documentation relating to previously conducted archaeological and historical investigations of the TCRC property were pr ovided by the NPS. The NPS also provided access to the research files on Camp Coldwate r compiled by local historian Dave Fudally. Additional information on existing historical designations; prev iously recorded archaeological sites; and previous archaeological and cultural surveys within the surrounding area were examined at the SHPO, OSA, and MHS Archaeology Department. The previous cultural resource studies examined include: \u0083 Historical Study Former U. S. Bureau of Mines Property, Twin Cities Research Center (Henning 2002) \u0083 Before the Fort: Native American Presen ce at the Confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers (Harrison 2002) \u0083 Archaeological Monitoring for the Minnesota Trunk Highway 55 Project (Schoen 2002) \u0083 Archaeological Research at the former Twin Cities Bureau of Mines Testing Facility, Minnesota (Clouse 2001) \u0083 Fort Snelling in 1838: An Ethnographic Study (White and White 1998) \u0083 A Cultural Resource Assessment of the Pr oposed Reroute for Trunk Highway 55, 54 th Street to County Road 62, Hennepin County, Minnesota (Hotopp et al. 1999) \u0083 Phase II Site Evaluation Report for the Closure of the Twin Cities Research Center (Ollendorf 1996) \u0083 Archaeology Phase I Report and History Site Evaluation for the Twin Cities Research Center (Ollendorf and Godfrey 1996) Early Explorer Accounts The journals and travel narratives of early EuroAmerican explorers to the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers confluence area were examined for references to its occupation and use. The earliest account examined was from Father Hennepin's travels in 1680. Mentions of Coldwater Spring were limited to accounts of the establishment of Camp Coldwater in May of 1820. No historical references to the use of the spring by American Indians were encountered in these records, although, the significance and use of the confluence area by American Indians was documented. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 16 Maps Historical maps available at the MHS and th e University of Minnesota's Borchert Map Library were reviewed. These maps provide d information on the location of the spring and the American Indian occupation of th e confluence area. A map depicting Dakota place names for the Coldwater Springs ar ea and the surrounding region was also reviewed (see Figure 10)(Shakopee Mdewakan ton Dakota Community 2003). A list of maps consulted for this study is included in the bibliography. Historical Photographs Historical photographs were reviewed for information on the development of the Coldwater Spring area. Thes e photographs included historic al images on file at the MHS, as well as aerial photographs from 1937, 1940, 1945, 1953, 1957, 1960, 1969, 1991, and 2003, on file at the University of Minnesota's Borchert Map Library. Additional Primary Research Additional primary documents examined included treaty records, newspaper articles, and collections of personal papers. A list of prim ary documents consulted is included in the bibliography. Secondary Sources A variety of secondary sources were consul ted during the study. Of primary importance were histories of Fort Snelling and the su rrounding area; ethnographies of the Dakota and Ojibwe; and previously completed studies, su ch as the archaeological and historical studies of the TCRC property, which provide syntheses of th e history of the study area (Clouse 2001; Henning 2002). A complete list of secondary sources is included in the bibliography. Agency Reviews During the TH 55 Reroute study, the SHPO commented on the relationship of that undertaking to Camp Coldwater. Documentation of these comments was reviewed. COMPARATIVE RESEARCH Additional documentation on springs and TCPs within Minnesota was reviewed. These materials included the National Re gister Registration Forms for Maka Yusota /Boiling Springs (Anfinson 2002) and Oheyawahi /Pilot Knob (White and Woolworth 2003), as well as compliance reports evaluating Taku Wakan Tipi /Morgan's Mound Wakan Tipi /Carver's Cave (Terrell 2003b). In 2001, an ethnographic overview of the St . Croix National Scenic Riverway was completed for the Midwest Region of the Nati onal Park Service (Zede\u00f1o et al. 2001a). This study, which documented Dakota and Ojib we resources within the park, provided comparative data on Dakota and Ojibwe lifeways and natural resource use. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 17 FIELD VISIT The report authors made visits to the TCRC property during th e course of this undertaking to become familiar with the project area and the natural and cultural resources within and around it. EVALUATION GUIDELINES Following the completion of the research and interviews, the National Register eligibility of any identified ethnographic resource(s) was evaluated using the Nati onal Register criteria to help assess the significance of each identified property. Guidelines for applying National Register criter ia to properties are defined in National Register Bulletin 15, How to Apply the National Register Criteria for Evaluation (NPS 2002). Guidelines for evaluating TCPs are particularly addres sed in the National Register Bulletin 38, Guidelines for Evaluating and Documenting Traditional Cultural Properties (Parker and King 1998). In order for a property to be eligible for lis ting in the National Register, it must meet one of the following criteria: \u0083 Criterion A - association with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; \u0083 Criterion B - association with the lives of persons significant in our past; \u0083 Criterion C - embodiment of the distinctiv e characteristics of a type, period or method of construction; repres entation of the work of a master; possession of high artistic values; or representation of a si gnificant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or \u0083 Criterion D - potential to yi eld information important in prehistory or history. Furthermore, a property must not only show evidence for historical significance by meeting one of the above criteria, but it al so must demonstrate that it has sufficient integrity to convey its significance. The NPS has identified seven aspects to be considered when evaluating a property's in tegrity: location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association. The integrity of each id entified property was assessed in regards to these seven aspects. Each property was also assessed to determine if it represented a type of property excluded from the Na tional Register because of Criteria Considerations. Finally, if a property met the criteria for eligibility, the area, period of significance, and boundaries, for that property was recommended (NPS 2002). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 18 RESOURCES OF THE TCRC PROPERTY This chapter provides a brief overview of th e natural and cultural resources known to be contained within the TCRC property. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING AND NATURAL RESOURCES The 27.32-acre TCRC property is located at op the bluff on the west bank of the Mississippi River just above, or north of, the confluence of that river with the Minnesota River (see Figure 1). The property consists of the buildings and grounds of the former U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center that was established in 1949 and closed by Congress in 1995. Fifteen buildings and their associated parking lots, and a circulation system of roadways cover most of the property (Figure 2). Open spaces within the west half of the property consist mostly of open lawns interspersed with trees, while the eastern edge of th e property where the bluff dr op begins is wooded, and the southeastern corner consists of open grassland. At present, the buildings of the TCRC are not occupied and the daily management and oversight of the property is the responsibility of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Wh ile the natural setting of the TCRC has been impacted by 185 years of EuroAmerican o ccupation, beginning with a military encampment in 1820, the following text provides an overview of the pre-EuroAmerican settlement resources that were present within the project area, as well as the natural resources currently present that may have associ ated cultural a nd historical significance. Geology The TCRC property is perched on the edge of the Mississippi River gorge, which was cut through the underlying bedrock laye rs by glacial waters as the last glacial period ended. The bluff is comprised of soft St. Peter sands tone that is capped by a thin layer of soft, gray Glenwood shale topped with a layer of ha rder, light-colored Pl atteville limestone. These rock formations, which date to the Ordovician Period between 425 and 500 million years ago, provided ready buildin g materials for the construction of Fort Snelling and other EuroAmerican structures (Clouse 2001:13 ). Furthermore, Clouse notes that the Glenwood shale formation was also a source of clay for brick-making at the fort (Clouse 2001:13-14). Hydrology and Water Resources While the TCRC property is located on an up land above the river, water resources are present within the project area in the form of natural springs and seeps. Due to the impermeable nature of the of the uppermost Platteville Limestone, groundwater seeks an outlet either by flowing (A) over the top of the limestone laye r; (B) through fractures and spaces between the planes in th e rock; or (C) at the intersec tion of the softer St. Peter sandstone with the harder limestone. Springs , therefore, are presen t at points where the limestone intersects the surface such as at bluff or terrace edges. In 1805, explorer Lt. Zebulon Pike stated that within the area betw een the Falls of St. Anthony and the mouth of the St. Peters (Minnesota) River \"the s hores have many large and beautiful springs United States Bureau of Mines - TCRC TCRC Property Ethnographic Resources Study Figure 2Hennepin County, Minnesota N Dependent Resurvey and Survey, U.S. Bureau of Mines, Twin Cities Research Center, within the Fort Snelling Military Reservation (Springfield Land Office, 1997) Coldwater Spring (labeled \"water retainment ponds\") U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 20 issuing forth, which form small cascades as they tumble over the cliffs into the Mississippi\" (Clouse 2001:12). Coldwater Spring While more than one seep, and potentially ot her springs, are present within the grounds of the TCRC property, Coldwater Spring, which is located in the cen tral portion of the TCRC property, is the stronge st flowing spring (see Figure 2). Beginning in May of 1820 this spring was used as a source of wate r for the military post of Fort Snelling and the associated community of Camp Coldwa ter (Figure 3) (Smith 1837; Clouse 2001:50; Henning 2002:20-21). In the 1880s, Coldwater Sp ring was subsumed into a pressurized water system for Fort Snelling. The creation of this system entailed the construction of a spring house and associated reservoir pond, as well as a pump house and water tank (Figure 4 - MHS Negative No. 25794 and 31105) (Henning 2002:21). These water works, though, became obsolete around 1904 and the pump house was razed in 1920 (Henning 2002:22). The open sp ace around the spring was s ubsequently adapted into a park that was labeled Coldwater Park on early twentieth-cen tury maps (Henning 2002:22). By 1949, though, the spring house and reservoir had fallen into disrepair (Figure 5 - MHS Negative No. 48008). Today the partially restored spring hous e and the stone reservoir from the 1880s waterworks remain (see Figure 5). The spring itself emits from a limestone rock face and spills into the reservoir pool. Other seeps are present around the reservoir pool. The water leaves the reservoir pool via a spillway and flows into a small, clear creek with a bedrock bed. This creek follows a ravine for about one-quarter mile before reaching a precipice from which it falls into the Mi ssissippi River (Clouse 2001:14). Historical maps indicate that prior to the construction of the reservoir the water from the spring apparently did not pool, but fl owed directly to the river vi a the ravine (see Figures 3 and 6) (Fuller 1853 [the Hotel is the former Baker trading house]). The primary spring currently associated with the reservoir has been traditionally identified as Coldwater Spring. Plant Communities The TCRC property is located within the Hot Continental Division, Eastern Broadleaf Forest Province, which is characterized as a transition zone between tallgrass prairie to the west and true forest areas to the east (B ailey 1995). Prior to EuroAmerican settlement the project area would have likely supporte d an oak savanna consisting of bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa ) set within grass species including With EuroAmerican settlement, and, in particular, the occupation of Camp Coldwate r and the construction of neighboring Fort Snelling, timber within the project area was likely harvested early on for firewood and lumber (Clouse 2001:13). An 1849 illustration of the Camp Coldwater and Fort Snelling area indicates that wooded areas are limited to the steep bluff slopes and the islands and lowlands within the river (MHS Negative No. 1895).

While each of these communitie s is summarized briefly below, a more complete list of plants within the center th at are known Dakota and Ojibwe traditional use plants is included in Appendix H. Landscaped Vegetation The landscaped open areas within the TCRC pr operty consist largely of introduced plant species, although some individual native trees (bur and northe rn red oak trees) that may represent remnants of the or iginal pre-settlement woodlan d/savanna are present. The landscaped vegetation, though, pr imarily characterized by ma intained lawns of fescue Introduced tree species within the landscaped portion of the center include plantings of pine ( Pinus sp.), babylonica ). Bluff-top Woodland and Forest Stands Along the eastern edge of the property is a bluff-top community of mixed deciduous woodland and forest stands. Mature trees w ithin this area include northern red oak, boxelder ( Acer these woodlands is comprised of sapling boxelder, sugar maple, and green ash trees as well as buckthorn (Rhamnus sp.) and red elderberry ( Sambucus racemosa) Alliaria petiolata ), a non-native forb. Wetland Plant Communities Three types of wetland plant communities (aqu atic, emergent, and forested) are present within the TCRC property boundary where th ey occupy drainages, ditches, ponds, swales, seeps, and springs and comprise seven distinct wetland systems. Aquatic wetlands are present at the Coldwater Spri ng and reservoir and within an unnamed wetland located in the southeastern portion of the site that is fed by the Coldwater Spring seepage. Floating vascular plants, and algae species are present within these aquatic settings as are marginal plants like wetlands are present within the T CRC property at locations associated with headwater wetlands that seasonally discharge via runoff and/or seepage. These wetland areas support mixed stands of br oad- and narrow-leaved Apocynum U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 26 androsaemifolium ), and goldenrod, ( Solidago sp.). Also present in these areas are marginal plants including black willow, box- elder, and green ash saplings and red elderberry and staghorn sumac ( Rhus typhina ) shrubs. Forested wetlands are located in drainage s and seeps on the prope rty. Common trees within these portions of the property incl ude eastern cottonwood, box-elder, green ash, American elm, hawthorn ( Crataegus sp.), and sycamore. As with the blufftop-woodland, the understory in the forested wetlands is comprised of sapling boxelder and green ash trees as well as buckthorn ( Rhamnus sp.) and red elderberry (Sambucus the ), and Jack-in-the-pulpit. Animal Resources Due to the urban location of the TCRC property, present day animal resources are largely limited to those that have adapted to life with in a metropolitan area. The proximity of the property, though, to the ri ver gorge and the lands of Fort Snelling Stat e Park allows deer and smaller mammals, such as fox, woodchuc k, squirrel, rabbit, and chipmunk access to the property. Prior to EuroAmerican settlement, this region was home to not only white- tailed deer, but other large mammals including small herds of bison and elk, bear, and some moose. Wetlands indicated on historic maps within the vicinity of the TCRC property would have supported frogs and othe r amphibians and reptiles, while fish and waterfowl would also have b een plentiful within the rive r and the upland lakes (Clouse 2001:14). Beavers and muskrat would have also been attracted to these resources. Wild rice beds were present in backwaters and fl oodplain within the Minneso ta River valley. CULTURAL RESOURCES PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE TCRC Since the closure of the U.S. Bureau of Mines, TCRC, the property has undergone a series of cultural resource st udies including archaeological, architectural, and historical investigations (Ollendorf and Godfrey archaeological excavations conduc ted in 1996, 2000 and 2001 within the TCRC property, no American Indian cultural materials were recovered. Lack of evidence for an American Indian presence, though, may be th e result of the test unit placement or the significant amount of disturbance that has occu rred on the site since initial EuroAmerican occupation. Excavations led by Robert Clouse of the MHS did identify areas within the property where intact (natural) soils survive and he suggests that \"there is a probability that some evidence of these earlier occupati ons [American Indian] may be present\" on the property although not discov ered to date (Clouse 2001: 59). Finds reported or collected by amateur historian Dave Fudally in the vicinity of the TCRC property support this hypothesis. These items include a stone ax found in 1987/88 \"50 yards south of the Bureau of Mines property ju st below Highway 55;\" a stone ax found in 1997 by two boys in the \"Camp Coldwater steam boat landing ar ea;\" and a \"spear point tip\" found at the Louis Massey site (Fudally 1998a and 1998b). While these materials were not recovered U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 27 by archaeologists and cannot be assigned to a particular time frame, they do indicate an American Indian presence in the vicinity of the project area. Through the excavation of 30 test units within the site, Clouse identified portions of the TCRC property that contain material culture relating to the occupati on of historic Camp Coldwater (Clouse 2001:65, 91). This area of intact deposits is located within the west half of the TCRC property a nd includes the Coldwater Spring and reservoir. A bone comb and an English style gunflint were among the early 19th century materials recovered (both of these objects were discovered within a unit located along th e west edge of the property) (Clouse 2001:79-80). Clouse recomme nded that further testing be conducted in areas of intact natural soils, and that the ar ea that yielded intact archaeological deposits from the period of significance for Fort Snelli ng be included within the boundaries of the Fort Snelling National Historic Landmark (NHL) and National Register District (Clouse 2001:iv-v). An architectural history evalua tion of the TCRC buildings found them to be eligible for listing on the National Register as \"a significant national a nd regional element in the history of science and tec hnology of mineral production an d mining in the time period 1949 to 1996\" (Ollendorf and Godfrey 1996:IB-3). The build ings form an historic district consisting of 13 c ontributing properties and two non-contributing properties and bounded by the current limits of the TCRC property (Henning 2002:3). Based on the results of Clouse's archaeol ogical study, and a historical study of the property by Barbara J. Henni ng of Rivercrest Associates (2002), it was recommended that the boundaries of the Fo rt Snelling National Historic Landmark (NHL) and National Register District that presently encomp ass only a portion of the TCRC property be adjusted to the west in order to encompa ss the Coldwater Spring and reservoir that are associated with important events and uses within the period of si gnificance for the Fort Snelling NHL and National Regist er District (Henning 2002:37). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 28 ETHNOHISTORY AND AMERIC AN INDIAN OCCUPATION At the outset of this chapte r it is acknowledged that ther e are many different ways of knowing the past. One way of knowing comes from what ar chaeologists and historians see in the archaeological a nd written record. Another way of knowing comes from American Indian oral history, experience, a nd perspectives. The au thors of this report believe that successful collaboration includes the exchange of information, and in the spirit of this collaboration, the authors offer the following summary of what is known about the TCRC property and the surrounding area based on the archaeological and historical record. It is our hope that this information mi ght be an additional tool for the Dakota and Ojibwe people with whom we have worked to know and e xplore their past. In a later chapter, Dakota and Ojibwe oral history, experience and perspectives shared by interviewees will be presented and discussed. Because the boundaries of the TCRC property are modern, artificial constructs of EuroAmerican origin, the following narrative of the American Indian occupation and use of the area is not limited to the property itself, but also includes the surrounding region, with a particular emphasis on the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers, which is a recognizable geogra phic feature in both oral a nd documentary accounts. The area associated with the confluence is no t limited to the point where the two rivers literally intersect , but encompasses the bluff area around the valley as well. As extensive documentation of the EuroAmerican settlement of this area is available in other studies, most notably White and White (1998); Clouse (2001); and Henning (2002), data from the period post-dating initial EuroAmerican cont act is limited to evidence for American Indian association with the project area. Situated near the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rive rs, the TCRC property is at the hub of a transpor tation network of waterways that once facilitated American Indian travel into the prairies of southw est Minnesota via the Minnesota River; the woodlands of the northwest por tion of the state via the u pper Mississippi River; the rolling countryside of southe rn Minnesota and beyond via th e lower Mississippi River; and the pine forests of eastern Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin via the St. Croix River. Due to its central location within this network of wate rways, many American Indian communities have connections to the vi cinity of the conflu ence. While the TCRC is located within the acknowle dged territory of the Eastern Dakota, the Ojibwe also traveled to the confluence, and the Ioway, Fox, Otoe, and Sauk are mentioned as having some contact with the area. Because, how ever, responses to th is undertaking were received from Dakota and Ojibwe representative s, and they have the clearest associations with the project area, the following cultura l history focuses on the presence of these communities within the confluence area. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 29 ANCESTORS AT THE CONFLUENCE While no archaeological evidence to document an American Indian presence within the boundaries of the TCRC property has been di scovered to date, arch aeological research conducted in the vicinity of the project ar ea and the region surrounding the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota ri vers has produced evidence for human occupation dating from at least 8000 B.C. As of today, the earlie st archaeological evidence that has been discovere d along the Twin Cities portion of the Mississippi River dates to the Paleoindian stage - the earliest period of human habitation in Minnesota known to archaeologists. The discovery of Paleoindian artifacts along the river indicates that this wa terway, which flows past the TCRC property, was being used during this pe riod. Among these finds is a Paleoindian- stage spear point dating to between approximately 10,000 and 8000 B.C. reportedly found on a bank of the Mississipp i approximately four-and-a-half miles northwest of the confluence. Because, however, this point was picked up by a collector, it cannot be confidently linked to th is location (Roberts and Roberts 1981) . The base of another early spear point, however, dati ng to between 8000 and 6000 B.C., was recovered by archaeologists from the area of the Sibley H ouse/Mendota Fur Post on the south side of the Minnesota River where it flows along Wita Tanka/Pike's Island (Minnesota Archaeological Site Form, 21DK312, on file at the SHPO). The Mississippi and Minnesota rivers meet at both the east ern and western ends of this island. With only two spear points, it is difficult to reconstruct what life near the confluence was like during the period between 10,000 and 6000 B.C. The lack of campsites or other occupations dating to this period may suggest that bands in search of food and other resources made only temporary stops within the area. It may, however, also be a reflection of archaeological excavations not o ccurring where such sites are, or of the destruction of such sites by the immense amount of development that has occurred in the metro area. Evidence for the occupation of the area surrounding the conflu ence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers during the Archaic stage co nsists of materials found at the Sibley House/Mendota Fur Post located on the opposite side of the confluence from the TCRC property and at bluff top sites located near Fort Snelling. The area of the Sibley House/Mendota Fur Post was us ed by American Indians from at least the Paleoindian period until well after Henry Sibley constructed his home. Evidence of Archaic-stage peoples uncovered during excavations within th e vicinity of the house consist of a side- notched projectile point (Brewerton) that date s to the later part of the Archaic stage. 1 1 It should be noted that although several archaeological excavations have occurred in the past at the Sibley House and Fort Snelling, not all of the artifacts have been cataloged, and reports detailing and synthesizing the results of these excavations have not been complete d. The MHS is currently working to complete these tasks. Fieldwork conducted at Fort Snelling in 1974 revealed \"chipped stone, waste flakes and broken tools such as scrapers and projectile points,\" while a review of the artifact catalog for work completed at Fort Snelling in 1988 and 1989, also reveals flakes and a point recovered during limited testing in the vicinity of the fort (Fiske 1974). A review, however, of the fi eld notes and artifact catalog from the 1996 excavations U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 30 Other archaeological sites indicate intens ive use of the confluence area during the Archaic stage. At excavations at the locati on of the former Fort Snelling hospital, on a bluff that overlooks the confluence, \"nearly 800 items were collected from soils removed to a depth of about two feet within an approximately 18 feet by 60 feet large area,...[including] seven complete or fractured projectile points, th ree end scrapers, and some 740 pieces of debitage (chipping debris). There are also fire-cracked granite and basalt cobbles, some shell fragments and a charred seed\" (Harri son 2002:14). To the south of this site, nearly 1,500 lithic items including debitage, points, and other tools dating to the later part of the Archaic stage were found along the same bluff. These items may be part of the same occupation indi cated by the evidence at the hospital site (Harrison 2002:17). Just a little over five miles to th e southwest of the fort, burials placed in pits and dating to the Archaic st age were found during a construction project just southeast of the Minnesota River and Bl ack Dog Lake, as were Archaic-stage spear points, bone tools, and ornaments of bone and shell (Minnesota Archaeological Site Form, 21DK41, on file at the SHPO). As with the Paleoindian stage, no full-scale archaeological excavations have been conducted at intact Archaic-stage sites n ear the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers (SHPO database query, September 1, 2005); therefore, only minor speculations regarding Archaic-stage use of the area may be made. American Indian peoples living near the confluence at this time continued to rely on hunting, as evidenced by the presence of projectile points at the si tes described above, but the shell fragments and charred seed indicate at least some use of riverine and plant resources as well. These types of resources were likely obtained during seasonal rounds that included the confluence area. At this point in the rounds, American Indi an peoples relied on locally available Prairie du Chien chert to make most of their tools, but occasionally used other, non-local lithic materials from further south along the Mississippi, which they may have obtained themselves during a different part of the seasonal cycle or through trade with others who were moving from area to area (Harrison 2002), if not a combination of both. Similarly, no known full-scale excavations of intact Ceramic/Mound- stage archaeological sites have occurred in proxim ity to the confluence, though several sites dating to this stage have been identified (SHPO database query, September 1, 2005). These sites are largely located immediately to the east and south of Fort Snelling on floodplains or terraces lying in between the Minnesota River and the severa l lakes that exist along it, and typically contain ceramic sherds and shell fragments, but some have also contained blade tools, triangular arrow points, scrapers, fire-cracked ro 21DK65, 21DK68, 21HE316, 21HE317, 21HE337, and catalog for 1996 excava tions, 21DK31, on file at the MHS). In addition, over 25 mound groups have been recorded within a five-mile radius of the at the Sibley House, indicates that the field documentation is, unfortunately, missing significant amounts of information; therefore, it is difficult to ascertain the level to which precontact components were investigated and what types of occupations and activ ities are represented by the precontact archaeological resources that were observed. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 31 confluence, several on landforms that direct ly overlook the confluence. Unfortunately, many of these mound groups have been destroyed or disturbed by previous development. Despite the lack of in-depth archaeological excavations dating to this period in the vicinity of the confluence, we can gain some sense of the lifeways of American Indians in the area during this time from the resources th at have been encounter ed at sites near the confluence. Arrow points rev eal that hunting was of contin ued importance for obtaining necessary resources, but the presence of potte ry indicates that food resources were being cooked and stored in new ways. The presence of a \"fair amount of she ll\" at several sites in the area indicates, not surprisingly, \"int ensive procurement of floodplain resources\" (Harrison 2002:11). At le ast two sites, 21HE316 and 21HE317, located within the current boundaries of the Fort Snelling Cemetery, contained enough lithic evidence to show that stone tools were being both ma nufactured and maintained there, while evidence from 21HE316 also indicated a separa te area for food processing and storage at that site (Minnesota Archaeological Site Forms, 21HE316 and 21HE317, on file at the SHPO). The combination of intensive use of riverine resources and food storage, along with the presence of numerous burials, has resulted in more substantial evidence for the use of the confluence area during the Ceramic/ Mound stage than during previous periods. During these longer-term occ upations, a more equal balance between hunting and other methods for obtaining necessary items was ach ieved, and, as would be expected for a place of residence, a multitude of activities took place. While the details of the activities that occurred during the Ceramic/Mound stage are still obscure, even less information is availa ble from the archaeol ogical record about American Indian activity around the confluence between 900 years ago and the time of the first contact between American Indians and Europeans near th e confluence during the late 1600s than about earlier periods. Only a few pottery fragments that might date to this time have been identified in the area (M innesota Archaeological Site Form, 21DK65, on file at the SHPO). Presumably, however , the move to seasonal, but even more permanent villages as observed during the contact period occurred gradually during this time, as did a shift to non-mound burials. The lack of archaeological evidence should not be taken to suggest that American Indians were not using the confluence area between A. D. 900 and the late seventeenth century. Although Father Louis Hennepin took no written note of American Indians at the confluence when he traveled through what would become the Twin Cities during the spring of 1680, French fur trader Nicolas Perr ot described the country of the Dakota as early as 1689 as being \"on the bor der of the River Saint Croix and at the mouth of the River Saint Peter [Minnesota River], on the bank of which were the Mantantans, and farther up into the interior to the north east of the Mississippi as far as the Menchokatonx [Mdewakanton], with whom dwell the majority of the other [Dakota] who are at the north east of the Mississippi\" (Pe rrot 1689, cited in Upham 1908; emphasis added). Given U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 32 Perrot's placing of the Mantanton2 Dakota on the Minnesota Ri ver as early as 1689, well before the biggest push by the Ojibwe in the mid to late 1700s, and given the presence of archaeological evidence of American Indians dating from 8000 B.C. through approximately A.D. 900 in the same area, it is clear that despite Hennepin's written observations, or lack thereof, American Indian s have always used or lived in the general area of the confluence. The confluence, at which the tw o major rivers, or transportation corridors, of the region intersected, though, may have been afforded some aspect of neutrality. In support of this neutrality is Le Sueur's acc ount of his travels along the Mi nnesota River in October of 1700. Le Sueur, who had established a post on the Blue Earth River near its junction with the Minnesota River (near present da y Mankato), was met by a party of nine Mdewakanton Dakota that told him that his current location was not desirable because it would cause those that wished to come to th e post to cross into the territories of the Western Dakota 3 and to \"be exposed to be cut off by their enemies coming up or going down these rivers [the Minneso ta and Blue Earth], which ar e narrow, and that if he intended to take pity on them, he must set tle on the Mississippi, in the neighborhood of the mouth of the St. Peter's river, where the Ayavois [Iowas], the Otoctatas [Otoes], and (Thwaites 1902:186; Wedel 1974:166). Le Sueur's account is not the only one to place th e Ioway in the vicinity of the confluence during this period. When wr iting his ethnography of the Dakota, probably during 1870 and 1871 (Anderson 1986:viii, xi), Samuel Pond (1986 [1908]:174) noted that the Dakota \"[boasted] of having expelled the Iowas from the country bordering on the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers [and] often spoke of having driven the Iowas from southern Minnesota. They did not speak of this as some ancient tradition, but as a well known event of comparatively recent occurrence, thoug h it must have taken place more than two hundred years ago.\" Pond (1986[1908]:175) also wrote, \"The small mounds, which may be seen on the left bank of the Minnesota at Eden Prairie and Bloomington, and perhaps at other places, are, the Dakotas say, the ru ins of dwelling houses built by the Iowas.\" Further: Dakota tradition states that the last great battle between the Mdewakanton Dakota and the Ioway was fought on Pilot Knob [southeast of and overlooking the confluence]. The Iowa y, it is said had resided in the Minnesota River valley area, but as the Mdewakanton Dakota came down from Mille Lacs area, they pushed the Ioway from the north side of the river to the south side. After th e introduction of fire arms, the Mdewakanton battled the Ioway on P ilot Knob 'back of Mendota' and the 2 The Mantantons also resided at Lake Mille Lacs and are thought to have merged with the Mdewkanton (Wedel 1974:170; Interviewee K:5). 3 Le Seuer referred to all Dakota that lived west of the Mississippi River as the \"Western Dakota\" and those that lived east of the river as the \"Eastern Dakota\" (Wedel 1974:163). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 33 defeated Ioway fled the area an d moved further southward (Neill 1881:191; G. Pond 1872:114) [Terrell 2003:38]. Some Late Precontact archaeological sites in southeastern Minneso ta, also have been connected to the Ioway, while some in the Bl ue Earth River valley have been tentatively connected to the Otoe, and some near M ille Lacs have been connected to the Mdewakanton Dakota. It appears that all of these groups were present in Minnesota when the first non-American Indian peoples came to the state during the seventeenth century, as were the Teton and Yankton Dakot a and the Assiniboine. It is unclear precisely where the Assiniboine resided at the time of cont act, though \"during most of the Contact period, the Assiniboine appear to have occupied portions of northern Minnesota\" (Dobbs 1990:54). The greater portion of northern Minnesota, however, and central Minnesota were occupied by the Eastern Dakota. It is known that Eastern Dakota villages existed at Mille Lacs Lake at th e time of contact, and Eastern Dakota villages were likely present at Sandy, Red, Cass, Leech, and Winnibigoshish Lakes at that time as well, given that Eastern Dakot a villages were in these lo cations during the 1700s. The account of explorer Perrot indicat es that the Dakota were also living in and using the area near the mouth of the Minnesota River as early as 1689 (Lettermann 1969:13-14). To the west and south of the Eastern Dakota villages at Mille Lacs were the occupations of the Teton and Yankton Dakota, while the Otoe were located well to the south of Mille Lacs in the area of the Blue Earth River valley. In the far southeast corner of the state during the 1600s, near the Mississippi, Root, and Upper Iowa rivers, and possibly near Red Wing as well, lived the Ioway, who Otoe oral tradition says were once part of a single group that included the Ioway, Otoe, and Missouri (Dobbs 1990). Over the 200 years following initial contact, numerous shifts occurred in the geographic placement of these groups, due largely to th e gradual movement of the Ojibwe into Minnesota and the resultant displacement of other tribes. Exceptions are the Ioway and Otoe, who moved from Minnesota to Iowa during the 1680s to avoid conflict with the western Mascoutens of Wisconsin (Wedel 1986). Having lived, in the years surrounding contact with the French, at La Pointe Island, a location gained after fighting with the Dakota and the Fox in an attempt to move westward along the southern shore of Lake Superior (Warren 1984[1885]:96), the Ojibwe s ought to move further west once they met the French in order to continue the fur trad e after the beaver population diminished in the vicinity of La Pointe (Warren 1984[1885]:1 26). They \"radiated in bands inland, westward and southward towards the beautiful lakes and streams which form the tributaries of the Wisconsin, Chippeway, and St. Croix rivers, and along the south coast of the Great Lake to its utmost extrem ity, and from thence even inland unto the headwaters of the Mississippi\" (Warren 1984[ 1885]:126]. The Ojibwe, armed with guns they had procured from the French through the fur trade, had a distinct advantage as they battled the Eastern Dakota and other groups for lands in Minnesota. Though such battles were not constant throughout the 200 years fo llowing contact, and the tribes did see times of peaceful interaction, the armed Ojibwe were highly successful in their efforts, permanently displacing the Dakota from Mille Lacs in the 1740s. By the 1780s, \"the U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 34 Mississippi Headwaters and most of the lake -forest region of Minnesota was occupied and controlled by [Ojibwe] people\" (Dobbs 1990:47). As a result of the southward and westward movement of the Ojibwe, by the early nineteenth century, Teton and Yankton Da kota groups were gone from Minnesota and had moved into the Great Plains. It is possi ble, however, that the Ojibwe were not the only reason for this relocati on. Some members of the Teton and Yankton groups may have already been occupying the Plains, wh ere bison were plentiful, long before the Ojibwe came to Minnesota (Michlovic 1985). With group members, and a steady supply of bison, already present, th e Plains area could have dr awn Teton and Yankton peoples further west than the area of present- day western Minnesota (Dobbs 1990:33). The Assiniboine moved to the north and west of Minnesota as the Ojibwe and European fur traders encroached upon the northeastern portion of the state, and ended up in Montana, North Dakota, and Canada after 1750. The onl y group that remained in Minnesota with the Ojibwe by circa 1820 was th e one that had for so long been the dominant presence in the state, the Eastern Dakota. By the early 1800s, after a long series of battles with, and displacement by the Ojibwe, \"the Eastern Dakota were established at a series of villages along the Minnesota and Mississipp i rivers\" (Dobbs 1990:34). DAKOTA PEOPLE AT THE CONFLUENCE The first thing that should be ackn owledged is that it was Dakota land. - Dallas Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, June 21, 2005 As described in the previous section, various historical events and pressures caused the Dakota to migrate southward in to the Minnesota and lower Mississippi river valleys over the course of two centuries. The following narrative describes their association with the area surrounding the confluence of the Mi nnesota and Mississippi rivers. The Old Village Dakota communities are identified by the name s and locations of the more permanent summer villages that were primarily situated within the Minnesot a and Mississippi river valleys. Here the community inhabitants woul d reside from late spring through fall while tending crops, fishing, and living off the resour ces of the river valley. They would then depart from this home base in the winter and spring months to purse an annual subsistence cycle that included the pursuit of game, such as deer, in the fall and winter, and the hunting of muskrats and the gather ing of maple syrup in the spring (Pond 1986:4- 5; 26-31, 44, 53). Early EuroAmerican explor ers navigating the rive rs of the region frequently noted the names and locations of these villages as they encountered them along their routes. While a Da kota village was not recorded at the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers from the early nineteenth century on, oral histories and the documentary record make reference to an \"old village\" that formerly occupied the confluence. This village is referred to as Ti Tanka Tanina; Tetankantane ; or Titankatatinna \u2014 the \"large old village,\" and is said to have been the initial village of the Mdewakanton Dakota in the confluence area upon coming down from the region of Mille U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 35 Lacs (Durand 1994:92; Ollendorf and Anderson 2004: 10). This village is said to have consisted of 400 or more lodges and is desc ribed as being made up of the bands of Wabasha, Red Wing, and Little Crow, prior to those groups splitting off to form separate villages further down the Mississippi River (Anderson 1984:74, 79; Durand 1994:92-93). EuroAmerican documentation of the original location of Ti Tanka Tanina is limited. As previously mentioned, Nicollet Perrot placed the Dakota at the mouth of the Minnesota River in 1689, although it is uncertain if he is referring to a village site or simply the occupation of the region around the rive r's mouth. A 1697 map by Jean-Baptiste Franquelin records the discoveries of Le Su eur including \"facts l earned from Le Sueur... which probably relate to the years before 1696\" (Wedel 1974:167). This map depicts a Dakota village, Touchouacsinton associated with the Nation de la perche on the north or west side of the Minnesota River below th e confluence with the Mississippi (Wedel 1974:166, 167). 4 While the village is not indicated at the exact juncture of the rivers, Delisle notes in 1702 that the village of Touchouacsinton \"was no longer at the river mouth,\" indicating that at so me point in time it was at the confluence and had since removed (Wedel 1974:166). No additional eight eenth-century documentation of the Dakota occupation of the confluence area is available until Jonathan Carver's explorations. The journals of Carver do no t indicate a village at the confluence in November of 1766, but Carver did not enc ounter any villages along the river until he arrived at a large seasonal encampment of Dakota near present day Belle Plaine. The following spring, Carver was met at \"the j uncture of the Mississi ppi and [Minnesota] rivers by 'part of two or thr ee bands of the Naudowessee [Dakot a] and a number of chiefs both of the plains and river bands' that he had invited to meet him there\" (Parker 1976:116). Pike's Treaty of 1805 The next available account of the Dakota pres ence at the confluence is the records of the expedition of explorer Zebulon Pike. As part of the duties of his expedition, Pike was charged with obtaining \"permission from the Indians who claim the ground, for the erection of military posts and trading houses , at the mouth of the river St. Pierre [Minnesota], the falls of St. Anthony, and ev ery other critical poi nt which may fall under your observation\" (Pike 1810a: III App. 66). As Pike came up the Mississippi River in 1805, he encountered the villages of Wabash a, Red Wing, and Little Crow, indicating that if the \"large old village\" of Ti Tanka Tanina was indeed a composite of these bands, it had broken up by that time into several smaller villages. Pike arrived on September 21, 1805, at the island in the confluence known to the Dakota as Wita Tanka (Big Island), but that would come to bear his name (Pike Isla nd). Here Pike campe d with his soldiers on the northeast point of the is land (Pike 1810a:24). On September 22, after 6 P.M., Pike took a canoe to visit an unnamed Dakota village on the Minnesota River where he ate and made arrangements for the council before returning to his encampment on Pike Island 4 The notes of Le Sueur and Delisle indicate that in 1697 and 1702 the Mendouacanton (Mdewakanton) or the Nation du lac (Lake Nation) of the Village du lac d'esprit (Village of the Spirit Lake) were still living near Lake Mille Lacs. The Touchouacsinton village was with the unidentified Nation de la perche . According to Nicollet, one of the Yankton bands was known as the \" gens des perches \" (Nicollet 1976:258). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 36 about 11 P.M. (Pike 1810a:24-25). The timing of this event indicates that the village was likely not far from the confluence. An 1810 map of Zebulon Pike's 1805 visit places a \"Sioux Village\" at the confluen ce and within the area of the land grant to the United States for the proposed military reservation (Figure 7) (Pike 1810b).5 Examination of Pike's more detailed original field maps from 1805, indicates that this village was the \"Fils de Pinichon Sioux Town\" located on the west side of the Minnesota River and within approximately two miles of the conflu ence (Figure 8) (Jackson 1966). Pike refers to this village as \"the Sioux' s [village] on the head of the St. Peters\" (Jackson 1966:37). When Pike met on April 11, 1806, with \"a great many chiefs of the Assussetong's [Sisseton], de Feulle [Wahpeton], and the Gens de Lac [Mdewakanton]\", he was transported from Pike Island to the village of the Fils de Pinichon at sundown, held a council, and then returned that same evening to Pike Island to di ne (Jackson 1966:118). The next closest village to the confluence in 1805 was the \"Petit Corbeau Village\" indicated on the east side of the river near the bend in the river at present day St. Paul (see Figure 8). FIGURE 7. DETAIL FROM AN 1810 MAP OF PIKE'S EXPLORATIONS SHOWING DAKOTA VILLAGE LOCATIONS AND LAND GRANT BOUNDARIES (THE \"SIOUX VILLAGE \" AT THE CONFLUENCE IS CIRCLED ) 5 It is likely this map that led to Charles A. Dana's statement in 1855 that as recen t as \"about 50 years ago, an Indian camp stood on the bluff, now occupied by Fort Snelling\" (Hansen 1958:xii).

While Pike met with seven chiefs or principal men of the Mdewakanton Dakota on the beach of Wita Tanka , only three verbally replied to his request for a gran t of land at the confluence, the falls of St. Anthony, and the mouth of the St. Croix River: Le Fils de Pinichon (Son of Pinichon),6 Le Petit Corbeau (Little Crow), and \" L'Orignal Leve \" (Standing Moose) (Table 1).7 Of these men, only Le Fils de Pinichon , who is identified on the treaty by his Dakota name Way Aga Enogee (He Sees Standing Up), and Le Petit Corbeau signed Pike's treaty of September 23, 1805 (Kappler 1904:1031; Durand 1994:93). It has been suggested that these two leaders were the only signers of the treaty because it was recognized by the other Dakota present that the lands within the grant were claimed by their villages (Foster 1854; Jackson 1966:n246). Certainl y in 1805 these two villages were the closest to the confluence, and the village of Le Fils de Pinichon was actually encompassed within the proposed land grant (see Figures 7 and 8). In addition, both of these leaders had ties to the \"great old village\" of Ti Tanka Tanina at the confluence . The father of Le Petit Corbeau , who met with Pike, is said to have been Mendokaycheenah (The Coming Summer), who was the leader of Ti Tanka Tanina (Red Owl 2005:5); therefore, while Le Petit Corbeau would have been the heredi tary chief of the former village and the area it encompassed, the band of Way Aga Enogee appears to have inherited the name associated with the physi cal location of the villa ge, because explorer Stephen Long in 1823 referred to Pinichon's village as Tetankatane or \"old village,\" and Joseph Nicollet in 1837 r its name as Tanina Ottonwe (also the \"old village\"), even though by the time of both Long and Nicolle t's visits the village had moved up river to Oak Grove where Nine Mile Creek join s the Minnesota Rive r (Babcock 1945:130; Foster 1854; Nicollet 1976:App. 3, 255; Pond 1986:5). In any case, at the time of Pike's treaty, the village of Way Aga Enogee , which was the descendant village of Ti Tanka Tanina , was still located near the confluence area, and the leader of that community, together with the descendant leader of Ti Tanka Tanina, Le Petit Corbeau , signed a treaty that released the la nd associated with the \"great old village\" to the U.S. Government. The lands granted by the tr eaty included nine miles square at the mouth of the St. Croix River a nd nine miles on each side of the Mississippi River from the falls of St. Anthony to be low the confluence of the Minnesota and 6 The ancestry of Le Fils de Pinichon /Way Aga Enogee is unclear. Some sources suggest that he was the son of a trader by the name of either Antoine Penichon or Pennesha George, depending on the source, who married a Dakota woman of Wabasha's band (Durand 1994:93). Another source states that the Le Fils de Pinichon /Way Aga Enogee was the son of a chief known as Tahkookeepayshne (What is He Afraid Of), which was shortened by the French and English to Pinichon (Foster 1854). Le Fils de Pinichon /Way Aga Enogee is the father or grandfather of Tahchunkwashta (Good Road), who was the leader of this band during the first half of the nineteenth century as EuroAmerican settlement increased (Foster 1854; Durand 1994:93; Interviewee K:5). Therefore, it is Tahchunkwashta (Good Road), who is most often associated in EuroAmerican histories with this village. 7 L'Orignal Leve is described by Pike as a \"war chief\" and he is thought to have been associated with the Red Wing band (Pike 1902:379fn; J ackson 1966:n38). He is said to have accompanied William Clark up the Missouri River during the War of 1812 (Jackson 1966:n38), U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 39 Mississippi rivers (Kappler 1904:1031). The boundaries of these land grants are illustrated on Pike's map (see Figure 7)(Pike 1810b).8 As mentioned above, the vill age of Pinichon removed from the confluence area to the mouth of Nine Mile Creek subsequent to th e signing of Pike's treaty. This may have been in response to the treaty or the increa sing encroachment of EuroAmerican explorers and fur traders on the confluence area. This removal resulted in the absence of any villages being recorded in the immediate area of the confluence by explorers Long in 1817 (Long 1890, 1978) Forsyth in 1819 (Forsyth 1880) or Keating in 1823 (Keating 1825), or in either Samuel Pond' s 1834 list or Edward Neill's description of early Dakota villages (Pond 1986:5; Neill 1889b:263-264). It is perhaps the continued association of the name Ti Tanka Tanina , though, with the Pinichon band that caused Pond to identify the mouth of Nine Mile Creek as a point fo rmerly used by the Mdewakanton as a meeting ground for large rendezvous (Pond 1986:175). By 1834, 15 years after the establishment of Fort Snelling, Pond describe s the closest Dakota villages to the confluence as being the village of the Black Dog band (\"two or three miles a bove\" the mouth of the Minnesota River), Cloud Man's village at Lake Calhoun, and Little Crow's band on the Mississippi River (Pond 1986:5). The leader of th e Pinichon village at this time was Tahchunkwashta or Good Road, who became the leader of this band in 1833 (Durand 1994:93). The Fort Snelling Period The movement of Dakota villages away from the immediate confluence area occurs in almost direct correlation to the increasing EuroAmerican presence in the region. After the establishment of a milita ry presence at the confluen ce in 1819, no Dakota villages are documented in the immediate vicinity of the fo rt. Rather the fort, Indian Agency, and the surrounding trading houses at Camp Cold water and at Mendota attracted temporary encampments of both Dakota and Ojibwe band s. Joseph Nicollet's sketch map of 1837 indicates clusters of teepee symbols at Benjamin Baker's trading house at Camp Coldwater; directly across the river from that location in the area known as \"Rum Town;\" on Pike Island below the fort; at Henry Sibley 's fur post at Mendota; and on both sides of the Minnesota River below the fort (White and White 1998:128) (Figure 9). Paintings of views around Fort Snelling during this period also illustrate teepees at many of these same locations. Despite the presence of Fort Snelling, the c onfluence continued to be a central location for Dakota ceremonial gatherings during the first half of the nine teenth century. It is well 8 Pike's treaty, while submitted by the President to the United States Senate on March 29, 1808 and ratified by that body on April 16, 1808, was never proclaimed by the President (Kappler 1904:1031). The actions of the United States government, though, including the construction of Fort Snelling, indicated that the treaty was assumed to be in effect and that the cession of the lands was an accomplished fact. At the time of the 1837 Treaty with the Sioux, the lack of ratification became a point of concern for the non-military settlers that resided in the Camp Coldwater portion of the Fort Snelling military reservation \"who believed the land belonged to the United States\" (Williams 1983:59). It was not until 1838 that the government submitted payment to the Dakota for the land (Jackson 1966:n 247). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 40 FIGURE 9. DETAIL OF THE CONFLUENCE AREA FROM JOSEPH NICOLLET 'S MAP OF 1837 WITH AREA OF BAKER 'S TRADING HOUSE AT COLDWATER SPRING CIRCLED documented, for example, that the Dakota continued to use Pilot Knob, or Oheyawahe , as a burial ground during the mid 1800s (e.g., Indian Graves on Pilo t Knob Opposite Fort Snelling , painting by S. Seymour 1850:113; Taliaferro 1835. EuroAmerican observers also documented an initiation ceremony in February of 1837 on \"a plateau halfway up the high hill of Pilot Knob\" (located to the sout heast of the confluence) (B ray 1970:211), a dance on Pike Island in 1838 (White and White 1998:127), a circa-1847 medicine dance \"on the St. Peters River near Fort Snelling\" record ed by Seth Eastman (Eastman 1995:193), and a medicine dance held in the summer of 1848 just back of Mendota (Hollinshead 1966). After the 1848 event, Ellen Rice Hollinshead re ported that \"the Sioux from the plains returned to their homes\" indicating that Dakota people came from a distance to the confluence area to observe cultural ceremonies. The confluence also continued to serve as a strategic point for EuroAmericans to meet with members of multiple groups of Dakota. As previously described, Zebulon Pike negotiated his 1805 treaty with the Mdewakanton Dakota at the confluence. Also, in April of 1806, Pike met with the \"a great ma ny chiefs of the A ssussetong's [Sisseton], Gens de Feulle [Wahpeton], and the Gens de Lac [Mdewakanton]\" within a council house at the village of the Fils de Pinichon near the confluence (Jackson 1966:118). On August 11, 1841, James Doty, governor of the Wi sconsin Territory, crafted a treaty at U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 41 Mendota with five of the seven Mdewakanton bands. According to this treaty, the bands ceded all of their lands and agreed to move to the left bank of the Minnesota River (Meyer 1993:74). The Doty Treaty, though, was never ratified by the United States Senate, and the exact location of the treaty si gning is not known. It was also at Mendota in 1851 that the treaty was negotiated with the Wahpekute and Mdewakanton bands of the Dakota which led to their eventual rem oval to a tract along th e Minnesota River in western Minnesota. The Exile and the Return The treaties described above, and others, ultimate ly resulted in the nearly complete exile of the Dakota people from the confluence area . Fourteen major land cession treaties, and some smaller agreements, would eventually be signed by the Ojibwe and Dakota in Minnesota. Under the Treaty of 1837, th e Mdewakanton Dakota ceded their land between the Mississippi and St. Croix rivers, ostensibly in exchange for annuities to be received for 20 years. Acco rding to Lettermann (1969:141): ...the only band which had to move its village from the eastern side of the Mississippi seems to have been the small band headed by Medicine Bottle [at Pine Bend, well south of the confluence]. It is quite well established that when the treaty of 1837 was signed Little Crow's band [Kaposia] had already moved to the west side of the Mississippi at South St. Paul, probably in the spring of 1833. Thus Kaposia lost only some additional hunting area on the east side and was not materially affected by the land provisions of the treaty. While the Dakota may not have described this loss of land as lightly as did Lettermann, the land ceded under the Treaty of 1837 was only a fraction of that ceded under the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux and the Treaty of Mendota during the summer of 1851. Under the latter treaty, the Mdewakanton Dakota ceded their lands west of the Mississippi River with the exception of a 45-mile-long strip measuring 10 miles from each bank of the Minnesota River from the Yell ow Medicine River southeast. Within a few years of this cession, which included the confluence area, \"Little Crow V of Kaposia, Grey Iron of Black Dog's vill age, Good Road of Penasha' s village, Cloudman of Oak Grove (Bloomington), and their bands left fore ver their beloved village sites and took up a ten year residence on the reservation es tablished for them on the Minnesota River\" (Lettermann 1969:202). The difficu lty of giving up their land and traveling the long road to the reservation was likely compounded by the fact that the Mdewakanton Dakota were leaving several locations both spiritually and emotionally significant to them. Eleven years after being removed to lands al ong the western Minneso ta River valley, the failure of the U.S. Government to keep its promises of annuities; poor business dealings by fur traders; and crop failure created tens ions that led to the eruption of the U.S.- Dakota Conflict on August 17, 1862. These hostil ities lasted for approximately six weeks and resulted in the loss of many lives on both sides and caused a large scale evacuation of settlers across southwestern Minnesota. In response to the conflict, the U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 42 U.S. Government hung 38 Dakota at Mankato, Minnesota on December 26, 1862; rescinded all treaties signed with the Dakota of Minnesota; and forcibly exiled them from the state. Small groups of Dakota, though, continued to live in Minnesota, often on lands that were owned by private benefactors. One such co mmunity remained in the Mendota area and lived just northeast of Oheyawahe /Pilot Knob on approximately 10 acres of land owned by Henry Sibley. The encampment platted as \"H. H. (Pinkney 1896) was present at Mendota through the mi d 1890s, and the Dakota who lived there in teepees, two log houses, and a single fram e house (Diedrich 1995:109) \"cultivated land, collected wild rice, made moccasins, and worked the harvest on local farms (Meyer 1993:270)\" (Terrell 2003a:48). Th ough the encampment \"had been virtually (Meyer 1993:292) near the turn of the twen tieth century, a few Da kota stayed at Mendota and their descendents form the current Mendota Mdewakanton Dakota Community, which is seeking federal recognition. Other Dakota made return visits to the area after 1851. In 1890, John Stevens (1890:162- 163) wrote: ...as a matter of history it is well know n that after their removal to the reservation [the Dakota] would, on a ny occasion possible, visit their old haunts on the bank of the Mi ssissippi on the east, and to the Iowa line on the south. This was not confined to the Medewakantonwans, but to the Wahpekutas, Wahpetonwans, and other bands. It is known that at least on some of these oc casions, well into the late 1800s, gatherings and dances were still held by the Dakota at Mendota. Meye r (1993:277) notes a dance at Mendota in 1885, while mention was made in 1886 that \"Pilot Knob is an ancient burial place of the Dakota's, and is yearly visi ted by many Indians of that nation\" (Hastings Gazette , February 20, 1886). In 1887, the government allotted small parcels of land at Bi rch Coulee, Shakopee, Prior Lake, and Prairie Island to Dakota people, who had risked their lives to leave the assigned reservations and return to their homelands in Minnesota. These lands were expanded upon and are now the locations of the Lower Sioux Indian Community, Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Community, and Prairie Island Indian Community. The Upper Sioux Indian Community near Granite Falls was established in 1938. The Dakota community that is most proximate to th e project area is the Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Community. OJIBWE PEOPLE AT THE CONFLUENCE While the TCRC property is located within Dakot a territory, the es tablishment of a United States military presence at the confluence in 1819 caused the Ojibwe to cross into Dakota lands to visit Fort Snelling and the Indian Agency. While the U.S. government sought to mediate between the Dakota and Ojib we at Fort Snelling, as White and White U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 43 (1998:117) observe, the presence of the fort also increased tensions between the Dakota and the Ojibwe within the confluence area. Scheduled visits to th e fort often occurred during the summer months, which was a time of year during which battles were frequently fought (White and White 1998:117). These tensions have resulted in records of the Ojibwe presence within the confluen ce area often being related to outbreaks of violence or moments of recogni zed historical importance, su ch as treaty signings. The following list provides an overview of the types of accounts that document an Ojibwe presence in the confluence area. This lis t by no means encompasses all records of Ojibwe activities in the confluence area, and by virtue of it being limited to the historical documentary record, is limited to occurrences after 1819. \u0083 1820 - In August of this year, Governor Cass, Co lonel Leavenworth, and Lawrence Taliaferro oversee a treaty betw een the Ojibwe and the Dakota at the confluence (Williams 1953:199; Hansen 1958:28). \u0083 1837 - The Treaty with the Chippewa is signed at the confluence by representatives identified as being from Leech Lake; Gull Lake and Swan River; St. Croix Courteoville [Lac C ourte Superior); Mille Lac; Sandy Lake; Snake River; Fond du Lac Red Lake; and Leech La ke (Kappler 1904:492) . The location of the Ojibwe treaty arbor is not known, but it was proximate enough to Camp Coldwater to hear the shouts coming from \"the direction of Baker's trading post at Cold Spring\" (Neill 1889a:132). \u0083 1838 - An Ojibwe party consisting of Hole-in-the-Day (Pa-goo-na-kee-zhig) and White Fisher (Wa-boo-jig), together with two Ottawa and an unidentified woman came to Fort Snelling in August of 1838 (Folwell 1956:151). According to the 1837 Treaty with the Chippewa, Hole-in-the-Day was a chief from the Gull Lake and Swan River sub-bands of the Mississippi Chippewa (Ojibwe), while White Fisher was one of the warriors from these sub-bands. \u0083 1839 - In June of this year approximately 900 Ojibwe came to the agency at Fort Snelling believing that their annuities from the 1837 treaty would be paid to them there (Folwell 1956:154). The tribes repr esented included 5 00 from Day's band; over from Crow Wing; a pproximately 150 from Leech Lake; as well as groups from the St. Croix and Mi lle Lacs (Folwell 1956:154). Over 1,200 Dakota also came to the fort at this tim e to receive their annuities. While the Ojibwe were instructed that their annuities would be distributed at La Pointe, they lingered at the Fort and the Dakota and Ojibwe held feast, dances, games, and councils over a period of days. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 44 ETHNOHISTORY OF COLDWATER SPRING This chapter provides an overview of the ethnohistory of Coldwater Spring, which is a natural spring centrally located within the TCRC property (see Figure 2). Historical accounts that link Dakota and Ojibwe people dir ectly to the limited area of the TCRC can only be recognized in the documentary record when reference is made to the historic locale of Camp Coldwater, which is known to overlap with the current boundaries of the TCRC property. By virtue of the association of these acc ounts with Camp Coldwater, they post-date the EuroAmerican occupation of the Coldwater Spring area, and should not be considered as indicative of either the relationship of either Dakota or Ojibwe people to the project area and the associated spring prior to 1820. ESTABLISHMENT OF CAMP COLDWATER The presence of the spring known as Coldwate r can be documented in the historical record as far back as 1820. At that time, the area surrounding the spring was occupied by the United States military as a summer camp during the construction of neighboring Fort St. Anthony/Snelling. The historical accounts of the movement of Colonel Leavenworth's camp from the east bank of the Minnesota River to th e site in May of 1820 are the earliest documents en countered during this study th at identify the spring by name, but they do not indicate if the name wa s derived from an existing American Indian name or was simply a descriptive term. An 1820 account describing the encampment around the spring states \"the wate r gushing out of a lime stone rock is excellent. It is called 'Camp Coldwater'\" (Doty 1953:433). Although there were no Dakota villages with in the immediate vici nity of Coldwater Spring during the period of the fort's occ upation, Chris Leith, Da kota elder and key cultural informant, who resides at the Prai rie Island Indian Community, has said of Coldwater Spring that \"people in the old village [ Ti Tanka Tanina ] used the spring water for medicine, ceremonies, washing, and purifica tion\" and the \"water nurtured the Indians who lived in the village, it was sacred. Th ey used the water in their sweat lodges\" (Hotopp et al. 1999:38). As desc ribed in the previous chapte r, this village was removed from the confluence by the early nineteen th century. Subsequent to 1820 and the establishment of Fort Sn elling, the area surrounding Coldwater Spring was no longer readily accessible to the Dakota. The United St ates military and the historical occupants of Camp Coldwater claimed the spring as their water source and occupied the area immediately surrounding it. This location wa s used as military quarters during the first two years of the fort's construc tion. As early as July of 1820, the Indian Agent Lawrence Taliaferro noted that American Indians were frequently visiting the military encampment and trading with the soldiers, which he felt undermined his authority (Neill 1889a:103- 104). As a result, restrictions were placed on soldiers trading with American Indians at the camp (Neill 1889a:104). After the fort wa s constructed, members of the failed Red River Selkirk Colony at Pembina were permitted to settle in the vicinity of Coldwater Spring until 1838 when all non-military personnel were removed from the fort's U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 45 reservation (Henning 2002:9). A community of structures, though, persisted at the spring. OJIBWE OCCUPANCY OF THE TCRC PROPERTY Among the structures established around Coldwa ter Spring after the military removed to the newly constructed fort, was Baker's trading post. It was at the location of this post, according to historical accounts, that the O jibwe traded and camped when they came to Fort Snelling (Neill 1882:103; Neill 1889a:132). While the Ojibwe's preference for the Coldwater area may have been due in part to the proximity of this location to the fort, it also was likely associated with Baker's speci alization in trade with the Upper Mississippi Ojibwe and the fact that his wife was of Ojibwe heritage (White and White 1998:147, 155). Peter Quinn, whose wife was also pa rt Ojibwe, resided in a cabin at Camp Coldwater from 1823 through 1844. These asso ciations, and others among the families of the Selkirk Settlement and former fur trad ers that resided at Coldwater, would have afforded the Ojibwe that encamped near the spring a level of comfort and tolerance within an otherwise potentially hostile territory. Accounts of Ojibwe people visiting Camp Coldwater during Baker and Quinn's re sidence include the Ojibwe camping at the site during the negotiation of the 1837 treaty and records of the attack on Hole-in-the- Day's party was attacked in August of 1838 wh ile on their way to \"M r. Baker's Trading House near the Fort\" (Papers of ce Taliaferro, Microfilm M35, August 3, 1838; Neill 1882:103). DAKOTA OCCUPANCY OF THE TCRC PROPERTY For the Dakota, though, the area around Coldwate r Spring was more difficult to access. After the establishment of Camp Coldwater, the area around the spri ng was frequented by the Ojibwe, and the EuroAmer ican presence at the spring was continuous through the 19th and 20th centuries. One account of a Dakota presence at Camp Coldwater occurred during the winter of 1842 to 1843, when the Dako ta from the Lac qui Parle area spent the winter at the camp (Hansen 1958:110). The EuroAmerican presence at the spring continued through the removal of the Dakota fr om the confluence area by the treaties of 1851. Subsequent to those treatie s, the outbreak of the U.S. -Dakota conflict resulted in the complete removal of the Dakota from the state. By the time of the return and the creation of the modern reservations in 1887, the spring had become the site of a water works for Fort Snelling. Furthermore, the nearest Dakota community to the spring was located at Shakopee, which was some distan ce removed from the confluence area and is an area that has other cl oser spring sources. BUREAU OF MINES PERIOD The water works at Coldwater Spring had become obsolete by 1904 and the pump house was razed in 1920 (Henning 2002:22). The open space around the spring was subsequently adapted into a park that was labeled Coldwater Park on early twentieth-century maps (Henning 2002:22). In 1949, th e U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center was established on the site and from that year until 1995, Coldwater Spring was largely lost to public view with in the grounds of the facility. During the U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 46 period that the Bureau of Mines was in operation, the TCRC property was fenced and access was provided through a gate on the Bur eau of Mines access road. A July 21, 1959 oblique aerial photograph of the Bureau of Mine s facility clearly shows the main gate at its present location on the property (MHS Negative No. 51956). A circa 1985 plan of the property, though, indicates that th e fence did not encircle the entire property, but rather discouraged access from the west and north e dges of the property with the highway and bluff providing a boundary to the south and east (Clouse 2001:58) . The following discussion of the possibility of putting a historical marker at Camp Coldwater describes how a portion of the property was mon itored in 1970 (Donn Coddington, Supervisor, Historic Sites, Minnesota Hi storical Society, to Joseph Ju sted, Executive Secretary, Hennepin County Historical Society, letter, October 28, 1970, on file at the SHPO, St. Paul): The Bureau of Mines people have been very cooperative wi th us and I am sure they would not object to the placem ent of the marker. The problem is accessibility. They have correctly fenced the area to keep motorcyclists from eroding the hillside. This fence is locked and it can be opened for visitors only by stopping at the main building of the Bureau for a key, permission, etc. When the problem of security and accessibility can be solved, we will install a marker describing Camp Coldwater. According to a former employee of the Bureau of Mines, the gate s were open during the day for public access from 7 A.M. to 6 P.M, and there were no requests from American Indian people to open the gates after hours. Former Bureau of Mines employees do not recall seeing American Indian visitors or evidence (such as prayer ties) of American Indian visits to Coldwater Spring duri ng the Bureau of Mines period, though one employee stated, \"It's been a question we 've asked ourselves\" (Jim Olson, personal communication with Mollie O'Brien, November 2005). TH 55 REROUTE PROJECT In 1998, during the Trunk Highway 55 Reroute project, extraordinar y public and media attention was focused on Coldwater Spring and the Camp Coldwater area.9 Personal affidavits from October of 1998 and public testimony from March of 1999 by American Indians during the TH 55 proj ect avowed that Coldwater Spring was a location of traditional cultural importance. These testimonies about the spring surprised the TH 55 cultural resource consultants, who were anticipating cultural statements about four oak trees that were within the pr oposed right of way (Hotopp et al. 1999:50). As a result of this testimony, the cultural resources management firm hired for the project, Louis Berger & Associates, Inc., conducted a preliminary evaluation of the spring and concluded, 9 In July of 1998, Bob Greenberg of Earth First! contacted tribal representatives about oak trees within the proposed right of way as well as Coldwater Spring. Chris Leith of the Prairie Island Indian Community referred Greenberg to Bob and Linda Brown of th e non-Federally recogni zed Mendota Mdewakanton Dakota Community. As a result of this contact the Mendota Dakota become involved in the TH 55 Reroute protest (Losure 2002:90-93). The entire history of the TH 55 project and protest is outside the scope of this document and the reader is refe rred to Mary Losure's book Our Way or the Highway (2002). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 47 \"Based on the available information, it appear s that the spring at Camp Coldwater may also be potentially eligible as a Traditional Cultural Property [but] at this time, there is insufficient information to make a determination regarding the traditional cultural value of Coldwater Spring. Additional research, in cluding a more thorough review of available historic and ethnographic sources for specific references to the spring, and perhaps additional interviews with tribal spiritual le aders, will be necessary to fully establish whether the spring may qualify as a Trad itional Cultural Property\" (Hotopp et al. 1999:56). In addition to the above-mentioned testimonies , official tribal statements were submitted in response to the TH 55 project (Appendix G). Among these statements were the following: \u0083 Letter to Minnesota Senator Carol Flynn 10 from the elected leaders of the four federally recognized Dakota Indian tribes in Minnesota, March 29, 1999 . Signed by Audrey Kohnen, President, Prairie Is land Indian Community; Roger Prescott, Chairman, Lower Sioux Indian Community; Dallas Ross, Chairman, Upper Sioux Indian Community; and Stanley R. Crooks, Chairman, Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux (Dakota) Community. This le tter contains the statement: \"As you are aware, the Coldwater Spring and the area at the meeting of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers have held significant cultural and practical importance to Indian people for thousands of years. We once again state our support of our spiritual leaders that the Coldwater Spr ing is a spiritual and cultural sacred site.\" This letter also states \"it is more factually accura te to state that the area maintains cultural significance to all 'Dakota people of Minnesota.' This broader description is appropriate because we believe no one group of Dakota can make any exclusive historical, cultural, or legal claim to the Coldwater Spring area.\" \u0083 Resolution I-99-87 of the Iowa Tr ibe of Oklahoma, October 26, 1999 . Approved by vote at a Regular Business Committee meeting held on October 26, 1999. Signed by Phoebe O'Dell, Secretary, Io wa Tribe of Oklahoma and Lawrence Murray, Chairman, Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma. This resolution contains the statement: \"Camp Coldwater is a sacred site for the Iowa Tribe and other Native American groups.\" Staff of the National Park Service's MNRRA office have attempted to follow up on this resolution vi a letters and phone calls to the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma, but received no response to requests for additional information on the sacredness of the si te, or how the NPS should consider managing the site. 10 Senator Flynn was the chair of the Minnesota Senate 's transportation committee. This letter was written in support of the Senate version (S.F. 1658) of a b ill introduced by Representative Karen Clark to recognize Coldwater Spring as a \"traditional cultural property which is entitled to protection and preservation\" (Losure 2002:100). The bill was passed unanimously in the Minnesota House of Representatives, but it was killed in committee in the Senate when Flynn refused to hear the bill in her transportation committee (Losure 2002:104; 126). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 48 BUREAU OF MINES CLOSURE PROCESS The United States Congress closed the TCRC Ma in Campus in 1995. After the closure of the facility and in preparat ion for the potential transfer of the TCRC property out of federal ownership, the Washingt on, D.C. office of the NPS initiated tribal consultation in 1999. This consultation included a meeting on September 11, 2000, held at the offices of the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community be tween staff of the NPS MNRRA office and the chairs of the four federally rec ognized Dakota communities. This consultation process resulted in the following tribal stat ements about Coldwater Spring and the ndent, from the elected leaders of the four federally recognized Dakota Indian tribes in Minnesota, September 13, 2000 . Signed by Audrey Kohnen, President, Prai rie Island Indian Community; Roger Prescott, Chairman, Lower Sioux Indian Community; Dallas Ross, Chairman, Upper Sioux Indian Community; and St anley R. Crooks, Chairman, Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux (Dakota) Communit y. This letter states that \" It is well established that for centuries, the entire area around Coldwater Spring and the meeting place of the Minnesota and Miss issippi River has he ld very significant cultural and practical importance to the Dako ta. Since this area has been the site of many significant events for the Dakot a, the protection of the area is of great importance to the Dakota tribes.\" The letter also submits points to be included in the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) including: \"The MOA shall include provisions that the signatories shall work to ensure that the flow of the Coldwater Spring must not be altered by any projec ts connected with this land conveyance or in future development projects in the surrounding area, and that the Dakota tribes are given a chance to review proj ect plans that may affect the Coldwater Spring area.\" Subsequent to the receipt of this letter, NPS staff explicitly asked the four federally recognized Dakota trib es in Minnesota if they considered Coldwater Spring to be a sacred site and they declined to acknowledge it as such at that time. \u0083 Letter to JoAnn Kyral, MNRRA Superinte ndent, from the elected leaders of the Prairie Island Indian Co mmunity, September 12, 2000 . Signed by Audrey Kohnen, President; Noah White, Jr., Vice-Pr esident; Lu Taylor, Tribal Council Secretary; Darrell Campbell, Tribal Counc il Treasurer; and Doreen Hagen, Tribal Council Secretary/Treasurer. This letter was also wr itten in response to the meeting held on September 11, 2000, with re presentatives from the four federally recognized Dakota communities in Minneso ta, the NPS, and the SHPO. This letter from the Prairie Island Indian Community includes the statement that: \"It is well established that the Coldwater Spri ngs and the area where the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers converge hold si gnificant cultural importance to the Dakota people. Our own history tells us that the spring was used in Dakota Healing Lodge because of its purity. River or lake water would never have been used in the healing lodge; only the pure water from the spring could be used. Because of this important use and cultural connection, we feel that the protection U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 49 of the site from any development is critica l. We are relying on the Department of the Interior to assure us that the site will forever be protected and Dakota people will have access to the site.\" \u0083 Resolution I-01-27 of the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma, March 19, 2001 . Approved by vote at a Special Business Comm ittee meeting held on March 19, 2001. Signed by Phoebe O'Dell, Secretary, Io wa Tribe of Oklahoma and Lawrence Murray, Chairman, Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma. This resolution contains the statement: \"Camp Coldwater is a sacred site for the Iowa Tribe and other Native American groups.\" Staff of the National Park Service's MNRRA office have attempted to follow up on this resolution via letters and phone calls to the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma, but received no response to requests for additional information on the sacredness of the si te, or how the NPS should consider managing the site. In the year 2000, a MOA was also drafted between the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation; the Bureau of Mines/Office of the Secretary of the Interior; and the SHPO to address historic resource preservation and planning issues associated with the closure of the property in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. In 2001, the previous pl anning process was te rminated; the draft MOA was never finalized or signed; and no further tribal consultation has taken place prior to the current study. At present, the buildings of the TCRC property are not occu pied. The daily management and oversight of the pr operty is the responsibility of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This federal land, though, is also located with in the boundary of the NPS' MNRRA. In October 2004, the NPS and the U.S. Fish a nd Wildlife Service signed a MOA to work together on the Bureau of Mines project. The MNRRA has been designated by Congress to lead the public planning process pursuant to the NEPA to identify and evaluate alternative disposition options for the TCRC property. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 50 DAKOTA AND OJIBWE RESO URCE USE OVERVIEW As touched on in an earlier chapter, the Dakota and Ojibwe followed an annual subsistence cycle that was coordinated with seasonal changes and the availability and location of resources. The seasonal rotation a llowed for the collection and use of plants, animals, and minerals within their areas of occupation. Recent studies completed for the NPS explore the complexity of this cycle a nd the variety of resources used by both the Dakota and Ojibwe communities of Minnesota and Wisconsin (Zede\u00f1o et al. 2001a; 2001b). Due to the limited acreage encomp assed by the TCRC property, the following discussion of traditional resource use by the Dakota and Ojibwe is restricted to those resources known to be availabl e within the TCRC property. DAKOTA RESOURCE USE Water Resources The primary water resource within the TCRC pr operty is the Coldwater Spring. Water is one of the natural elements, or forces that the Dakota regard as having spiritual powers (Eastman 1911:14). While water is used by the Dakota for everyday tasks such as drinking, cooking, bathing, and washing, it is also used for making medicine, purification, and in th e performance of ceremonies (Leith 1998). All seven of the Dakota sacred ceremonies use water in some fashion (Red Owl 2005:3). Water from springs is considered to be particularly pure because it co mes from inside the eart h. For that reason springs are sought out as a water source fo r medicinal and ceremonial uses including sweat lodges and healing rituals (Zede\u00f1o et al . 2001a:107, 110, 117). Oral and documentary accounts point to Dakota communities using specific springs in the vicinity of villages to gather water for ce remonies, for example, the Dakota who resided in the area of Prairie Island ga thered water for ceremonies from Mini BoMdota or Rattling Springs near the Vermillion River (Durand 1994:60). Dakota elder Curtis Campbell recalled Prairie Is land residents going to Mini BoMdota to gather water for ceremonies when he was a boy (Curtis Cam pbell, Prairie Island Indian Community, September 20, 2005). This spring, though, has not been used for some time because it is now on private land (Curtis Campbell, Prai rie Island Indian Community, September 20, 2005; Chris Leith, key cultural expert, Se ptember 22, 2005). Another spring was identified in association with the Dakota inhab itants of the village formerly located on the shores of Lake Calhoun in present day Minneapolis. During the 1850s, it was said of this spring: \"Both Man-of-the-C louds and Good Road were born on the banks of Lake Calhoun. They had great faith in the heali ng virtues of the water of a spring at Owen Keegan's claim, which they would come all the way from Redwood and Yellow Medicine to bathe in, and drink of\" (Stevens 1890:163). 11 Not only does this citation 11 Owen Keegan's (Kegan) claim was filed on April 2, 1857 and included the SE \u00bc of the NE \u00bc, and the NE \u00bc of the SE \u00bc of Section 19 of Township 29N, Range 24W (United States Bureau of Land Management 1995). These 80 acres are currently bi sected by the east-west route of Olson Memorial U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 51 corroborate the historical root s of the Dakota belief in th e healing powers of natural springs, but this account also testifies to th e fact that Dakota people returned to their traditional lands to use the resources within t hose areas even after the treaties of 1851. It should be noted that while the EuroAmerican observer certainly felt that the water was regarded by the Dakota as having \"healing virtues,\" the use, or activity, that he described solely consisted of using the water for bathi ng and drinking. If water was gathered from the spring for ceremonies, or for making medici ne, perhaps even back on the reservation, this activity would have been indistinguishable to a EuroAmerican observer from the action of collecting water for drinking purposes. Inipi: Sweat Lodge While all seven of the Dakota s acred ceremonies use water in some fashion, the particular ceremony frequently associated with spring water is the Inipi , which is commonly known as the sweat lodge or healing l odge (Leith 1998; Campbell 2000:25). Charles Eastman, who was the of the above-mentioned Cloud Man ( Mahpiya Wichashta ), the leader of the Mdewakanton village at Lake Calhoun, stated that the Inipi is \"deemed essential to the Indian's effort to purify and recreate his sp irit. It is used both by the doctor and his patient. Every man must enter the clean sing bath and take the cold plunge which follows, when preparing for an y spiritual crisis, fo r possible death, or imminent danger\" (Eastman 1911:80-81). East man (1911:78) stated th at it was one of two ceremonies that he thought were universal among Native Americans, and, therefore, \"fundamental.\" The other ceremony was that of the pipe. He noted that within Dakota legends and traditions, these two ceremonies were \"handed down from the most ancient time and [were] persisting to the last\" (Eastman 1911:78). In Samuel Pond's ethnography The Dakota or Sioux in Minn esota as they were in 1834 , he describes the sweat lodge , or \"the vapor bath\" as he calls it, as follows: In preparing for this bath, a small hemispherical framework was constructed by sticking the ends of slender poles in the ground and bending them over. The frame was cove red with skins or blankets, being only three or four feet high, just large enough to accommodate those who were to undergo or enjoy the stea ming. Water was poured on heated stones placed in this little tent, fillin g the interior instantly with hot vapor [Pond 1986:419-420]. Eastman states that, \"Not onl y the 'ene\u00e9pee' itself, but ev erything used in connection with the mysterious event, the aromatic cedar and sage, the water, and especially the water-worn boulders, are regarded as sacred, or at the least adapted to a spiritual use\" Highway (Highway 55) and are located to the immediat e west of the City of Minneapolis' Theodore Wirth Park and Wirth Lake, which was originally known as Keegan's Lake (Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board 2004). Descendents of Cloud Man reside today at the Upper Sioux Indian Community and five interviewees trace their lin eage to this leader. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 52 (Eastman 1911:81). In some cases, medicine pl ants were boiled in the water used in the Inipi prior to it being poured on the rocks (Campbell 2000:25). The missionary J. P. Williamson told Samuel Pond that the sweat lodge was a practice that the Dakota seemed \"more reluctant to abandon...than any other\" (Pond 1986:104). Pond suspects that the importance of the sweat lodge to the Dakota is linked to the healing aspect of the bath and he relates how the Dakota prepared a sweat lodge for Father Louis Hennepin when he was ill. Of this event, in 1680 Hennepin (1872:310) said: He set before me a bark dish full of fish, and seeing that I could not rise from the ground he had a small sweating cabin made, in which he made me enter naked with four Indians. This cabin he covered with buffalo skins, and inside put stones red to th e middle. He made me a sign to do as the others before beginning to sweat, but I merely concealed my nakedness with a handkerchief. As soon as these Indians had several times breathed out quite violently he be gan to sing vociferously, the others putting their hands on me and rubbing me while they wept bitterly. I began to faint, but I came out and coul d scarcely take my habit to put on. When he made me sweat thus three times a week, I felt as strong as ever. Eastman also describes the Inipi as being tied to the creation story of the first man (Eastman 1911:79-80): In our Creation myth or story of the First Man, the vapor-bath was the magic used by The-one-who-was-First-Cr eated, to give life to the dead bones of his younger brother, who had b een slain by the monsters of the deep. Upon the shore of the Great Water he dug two round holes, over one of which he built a low inclosure [sic] of fragrant cedar boughs, and here he gathered together the bones of his brother. In the other pit he made a fire and heated four round stone s, which he rolled one by one into the lodge of boughs. Having closed every aperture save one, he sang a mystic chant while he thrust in his arm and sprinkled water upon the stones with a bunch of sage. Immediat ely steam arose, and as the legend says \"there was an appearance of life.\" A second time he sprinkled water, and the dry bones rattled together. The third time he seemed to hear soft singing from within the lodge; and the fourth tim e a voice exclaimed: \"Brother, let me out!\" (It should be noted that the num ber four is the magic or sacred number of the Indian.) One Dakota elder that we interviewed suggested that in going into the Inipi , one is getting as close to the original creation as possibl e (Gary Cavender, key cultural expert, August 23, 2005), and others said that it is the mother's womb and re presents a renewal or rebirth (Elitta Gouge, Upper Sioux Indian Community, October 25, 2005; Edward Red Owl, key cultural expert, October 25, 2005). The above-referenced historical a ccounts indicate that the sweat lodge was being used by the Dakota at the time of the earliest EuroAmerican U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 53 contact, and it is currently described as being an \"ancient\" and \"fundamental\" ceremony. The sweat lodge is still practiced by Dakota people toda y and the practice of the current ceremony is consistent with the accounts provided by Hennepin and Pond. In the absence of access to a spring source, well water (Chris Leith, key cultural expert, September 22, 2005) has been used by inte rviewees for sweat lodges and other ceremonies. Indeed, as some traditional comm unity springs, like \"Rattling Springs\" near Prairie Island, are now on private property, alternative water sources must be sought (Chris Leith, key cultural expert, September 22, 2005). Plant Resources Prior to EuroAmerican settlement, the ar ea currently occupied by the TCRC property supported an oak savanna consisting of bur oaks (Quercus macrocarpa) set within tall grass species that likely included big bluestem ( Andropogon gerardii ) and Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans ). Bur oaks have been traditionally used by the Dakota as a source of wood and acorns, which were leached and ground to flour. Traditional Dakota uses are not known for the grasses that were lik ely present within the property prior to EuroAmerican contact. In addition to bur oak, whic h are still present on the prop erty, there are other plant resources within the TCRC parcel that have identified traditional Dakota uses - even though the plants themselves may have been introduced to the project area. These include plants that Dakota people use as: \u0083 Edible resources (Sugar Ceremonial resources (Green Ash; Boxelder). For a complete list of these plants, their scientific names, and associated uses see Appendix H. Mineral Resources In his archaeological study of the TCRC prope rty, Clouse notes that the Glenwood shale formation was used as a source of clay fo r brick-making at the Fort Snelling (Clouse 2001:13-14). Clouse does not indi cate, though, if a clay sour ce was accessible within the TCRC property. Clays were used by both the Dakota and Ojibwe not only making pottery, but also for body painting and dyeing (Zede\u00f1o et al. 2001a:77). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 54 OJIBWE RESOURCE USE Water Resources The Coldwater Spring is the primary water re source within the TCRC property. Like the Dakota, the Ojibwe regard water as a sacred element and a form of medicine in its own right (Zede\u00f1o et al. 2001a:89-90) . Water is used by the Ojibwe for a variety of purposes including common uses such as drinking, cookin g, and bathing, but also in the making of medicine and the performance of ceremonies. Spring water is regarded by the Ojibwe as especially pure, and for this reason spring s are considered importa nt water sources for medicinal and ceremonial uses including th e sweat lodge (Zede\u00f1o et al. 2001a:85-86, 89- 90, 94). Plant Resources Numerous plants that current ly exist within the TCRC prop erty, although they may have been introduced to the project area, have doc umented Ojibwe uses. These include plants that Ojibwe people use \u0083 Edible resources resources (Dogbane). For a complete list of these plants, their scientific names, and associated uses see Appendix H. Mineral Resources See note in section on Dakota Resource Use. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 55 SUMMARY OF INTERVIEWS: CU LTURAL CONNECTIONS TO THE TCRC This chapter summarizes the results of the interviews with Dakota and Ojibwe tribal representatives and key cultur al experts. During the cour se of the interviews the following themes were identified by the interviewees as having association with the TCRC property: \u0083 the Mdote area at the confluence of the Minneso ta and Mississippi rivers, which is regarded as the center of all things and historically significant by the Mdewakanton Dakota; \u0083 creation beliefs; Coldwater Spring; \u0083 the Dakota tradition of the Unktehi ; and \u0083 the presence of plant resources. DAKOTA INTERVIEWS Interviews were conducted with seven official representatives of federally recognized Dakota communities, as well as with six Dakota key cultural experts. All four of the federally recognized Dakota communities in Mi nnesota were officially represented. None of the key cultural expert s were representing their tribe in an official capacity. Some representatives and key cu ltural experts were present at more than one interview. Geographic Connections: Mdote It is well established that for centuries, the entire area around Coldwater Spring and the meeti ng place of the Minnesota and Mississippi River has held very significant cultural and practical importance to the Dakota. - Letter from the elected leaders of the four federally recognized Dakota tribes in Minnesota, 9-13-2000 Interviewees repeat edly stated that the TCRC property is part of an area identified by the Dakota as Mdote and that it cannot be divorced from this larger context. Among those that made this statement were an offici al member of a federally recognized Dakota community (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, June 21, 2005); a key cultural expert (Gary Cavender, ke y cultural expert, August 9 and August 23, 2005); and a member of the non federally recognized Mendota Mdewakanton Dakota Community (Jim Anderson, personal communication, June 24, 2005). A map of the Dakota presence within the Minnesota and Mississippi river valleys create d by the Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Community (2003) in cons ultation with their elders, also places Mni Sni (Coldwater Spring), and thereby at leas t a portion of the TCRC property, within the shaded area that demarcates Mdote on the map (Figure 10). United States Bureau of Mines - TCRC Dakota Presence in the River Valley Ethnographic Resources Study Figure 10 Hennepin County, Minnesota Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Community 2003 U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 57 While American Indian people do not genera lly put boundaries around places of cultural significance the way that non-natives do, within the Dakota territory, which encompasses all of southern Minnesota, the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers is regarded as a place of particular cultural significance. This confluence, which the TCRC property is located just above, or north of, is known to the Dakota as Mdote , which means \"the joining of one stream [creek, river] to another\" in the Dakota language (Cavender 1988:12-13) (see Figure 1). This particular mdote is also more specifically known as Mdote Minisota - the mouth of the Minnesota Rive r. The Mdewakanton Dakota told explorer Joseph Nicollet that they considered the confluence to be th e middle of all things and the exact center of the earth or Makoce Cokaya Kin (Cavender 1988:13; Durand 1994:56; Neill 1882:1; Wilson 2000). 12 A similar tradition was recounted by Pond (1851), who noted that the Dakota assert th at the \"mouth of the Minnesota River ( Watpa Minisota ) lies immediately over th e center of the earth a nd under the center of the heavens.\" In one Mdewakanton Dakota belief, Mdote Minisota is also where the Dakota first appeared (Cavender 1988:13). The area of cultural sign ificance associated with Mdote Minisota , though, is not limited to the point at which the waters of the two rive rs join, but it is transmitted to the islands within the confluence area, th e surrounding shores, and the bl uff tops. One Dakota elder noted specifically that Mdote encompasses Pike Island, Fort Snelling, and the bluffs across the river (Gary Cavender, key cultura l expert, August 9, 2005). The lands around the juncture of the rivers have b een described as \"sacred grounds\" and ry Cavender, key cultural expert, August 9, 2005). They have also been described as a \"neutral area\" or \"common ground,\" by interviewees Tom Ross of the Upper Sioux Indian Community (June 21, 2005) and Dakota key cultural expert Gary Cavender (August 23, 2005). Associated with Mdote are numerous locations of cult ural importance to the Dakota, including sacred landmarks, ceremonial gath ering spots, habitati on sites, and burials (Terrell 2003a:81-82). The occu rrence of these significant ev ents within a radius around the confluence is a testimony fo r the Dakota of the centrality and power of this location (Cavender 1999). Important events in Dakota history also took place within Mdote . Some examples of these locations used 1837 initia tion ceremony and 1848 medicine dance \u0083 Dakota burials on Oheyawahe \u0083 1805 Treaty with the Sioux (Pike Treaty) \u0083 1838 dance on Pike Island \u0083 1841 Doty Treaty 12 For the Yankton Dakota the center of the earth is the Continental Divide, while the Teton or Dakota people believe it is the Black Hills (Cavender 1988:13). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 58 \u0083 1851 Mendota Treaty with the with the Wahpekute and Mdewakanton bands \u0083 1862 Dakota interment camp below Fort Snelling Several of these sites are identified on a map created by the Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Community (2003) (Figure 10). The cultural significance of Mdote to the Dakota: \u0083 was emphasized by interviewees (e .g. Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, June 21 and October 25, 2005; Gary Cavender, key cultural expert, August 9 and 23, 2005; Jim Anderson, pe rsonal communication, June 24, 2005; Red Owl 2005:4); \u0083 historically documented (D urand 1994:56; Neill 1882:1); and \u0083 has been testified to in written documenta tion from the elected leaders of the four federally recognized Dakota communities in Minnesota (Tribal chairs of the four federally recognized Dakota communities in Minnesota to JoAnn Kyral, MNRRA Superintendent, letter, September 13, 2000; Elected leaders of the Prairie Island Indian Community to JoAnn Kyral, MN RRA Superintendent, letter, September 12, 2000) (Appendix G). Connections to Creation Beliefs In one Mdewakanton Dakota belief, as record ed by Chris Cavender in his article on the Dakota of Minnesota, it is at the confluence of Mdote Minisota , that the Dakota first appeared as spirit beings from the stars (Cavender 1988:13). On e interviewee, Gary Cavender, a Dakota elder and key cultural expe rt, has related this tradition in the past (Cavender 1999) and provided the following a ccount during the course of this study (Gary Cavender, key cultural expert, August 9, 2005): There are seven groups of Yankton, Yanktonai, and Teton] seven stars in the constellation of Orion. 13 We are the spirit beings from the constellation of Orion and those seven stars. This whole area [ Mdote ] is important to us because this is where we first came as spirit beings - to the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers. We spread out from there becoming human beings as we spread out from there. Tom Ross (Upper Sioux Indian Community, June 21, 2005) also st ated that he had heard this tradition from Gary Cavender. Mr. Cavender also stated that: The water from Coldwater Springs comes out from underneath the land and so some of the spirit beings that arrived went into the water and they appeared on earth here and so became Dakotahs. That is the connection there (Gary Cavender, key cultu ral expert, August 9, 2005). 13 The stars of Orion and the seven stars of the Pleiades are alternately cited in accounts of this belief. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 59 Mr. Cavender's oral histor y associates Coldwater Sp ring, and thereby the TCRC property, with the Mdote creation. Water Resources Water is very, very sacred to us. - Joe Williams, key cultural expert, October 25, 2005 In our belief the earth is our mother. We call her Mother Earth. And it is my belief that the aquifers ar e the heart of Mother Earth, and her life-blood - her veins - are the springs, which in turn feed the rivers. Therefore, these places are sacred to us. - Joe Williams, key cultural expert, November 5, 2005 Water is one of the natural elements, or forces that the Dakota regard as having spiritual powers (Eastman 1911:14). Water is equa ted with life and considered to be wakan (mysterious/powerful/spiritual) by virtue of it s inherent bond with \"m other earth\" and its connection to all living things (Tom Ro ss, Upper Sioux Community, June 21, 2005; Joe Williams, key cultural expert, October 25, 2005; Campbell 2000:24). 14 During interviews conducted for this study, official Dakota repr esentatives and key cultural experts described water as \" wakan \" (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Community, June 21, 2005); \"as one of the most sacred items\" (Joe Williams, key cultural expert, October 25, 2005); and as the \"most powerful medicine in the world\" (Chris Leith, key cultural expert, September 22, 2005). Because \"water is the giver of life and it makes things grow\" (Leith 1998), it is associated with, and is used for, medicine and healing (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Community, June 21, 20 05; Chris Leith, key cultural expert, September 22, 2005). This use is not limited solely to water in li quid form, but it is recognized that certain medicine plants are present only in the vici nity of water sources, such as the unique environment around natural springs, and that th ese things are interconnected (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Communit y, October 25, 2005; Joe Will iams, key cultural expert, October 25, 2005) (see Appendix H for a discussi on of plants within the TCRC property that are documented in the ethnographic literatu re as having Dakota and Ojibwe cultural uses). Joe Williams, a key cultural expert, stat ed that the \"creator has created [sources of water] for people to live by\" (October 25, 2005). Coldwater Spring Coldwater Spring, which is located within the TCRC property, was identified during interviews as a cultural resource associated with the Mdote area (e.g. Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, June 21, 2005; Gary Cavender, key cu ltural expert, August 9 and August 23, 2005; Jim Anderson, personal co mmunication, June 24, 2005). It is also identified as such on a map prepared by the Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Community 14 Gideon and Samuel Pond, who lived among the Dakota, said of the word wakan that it \"signifies anything that is incomprehensible. The more incomprehensible, the more wakan \" (Pond 1889:217). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 60 (2003) in consultati on with their elders (Figure 10). Oral traditions described below, document the historical use of the Cold water Spring by Dakota people for ceremonial purposes. Springs are considered by the Dakota to be particularly significant water sources and much more than places where water can be found. Locations where springs have been created are considered places of sacredness and healing. While, according to one Dakota elder, any water can be pur ified through prayer (Gary Ca vender, key cultural expert, August 23, 2005), water from springs is consid ered inherently pure because it comes directly out of the ground and continually rene ws itself (Curtis Campbell, Prairie Island Indian Community, September 20, 2005; Gary Cavender, key cultural expert, August 23, 2005; Edward Red Owl, key cultural expert , October 25, 2005; Leith 1998). Because spring water renews itself, it is considered to have the ability to renew the user and hence it has healing properties. For this reason, and its purity, spri ngs are the traditional source of water for medicine and ceremonies. During the course of this study no Dakota names for Coldwater Spring were encountered within historical documents. Dakota names that are in current use are Mni Sni (Cold Water); Pa Suta Mni (Medicine Water); and Mni Wakan (Spirit Water) (Michael Scott, personal communication, June 23, 2005). In ou r interview with Gary Cavender, a key cultural expert and elder, he said that the name of the spring was not \"cold water,\" but he could not recall its Dakota name (Gary Cave nder, key cultural expert, August 9, 2005). During the course of this study, no historic al documentary evidence for the American Indian use of the specific spring known as Co ldwater was encountered, but is inherently understood by the official Dakota representatives interviewed that a natural spring like Coldwater Spring would have been used for ceremonial purposes particularly because of its relationship to Mdote. As one Dakota elder suggest ed, \"inhabitants of the Mendota area likely used Coldwater Spring\" as a community spring (Curtis Campbell, Prairie Island Indian Community, Se ptember 20, 2005). Though during the period of the fort's occupation there were no Dakota villages within the immediate vicinity of Coldwater Spring, historical evidence and or al histories indicate that prior to the fort, there was once a large village at the confluence known as Ti Tanka Tanina or \"great old village.\" Chris Leith, a Dakota elder and key cultural informan t, who resides at the Prairie Island Indian Community, said of Coldwater Spring in hi s testimony during the TH 55 Reroute project that \"people in the old village used the sp ring water for medicine, ceremonies, washing, and purification\" and the \"water nurtured th e Indians who lived in the village, it was sacred. They used the water in their sweat lodges\" (Hotopp et al. 1999:38). The elected officials of the Prairie Island Indian Comm unity also wrote in 2000: \"It is well established that the Coldwater Springs and the area where the Minne sota and Mississippi rivers converge hold significant cultural im portance to the Dakota people. Our own history tells us that the spring was used in Dakota Healing Lodge because of its purity. River or lake water would never have been us ed in the healing lodge ; only the pure water from the spring could be used\" (Kohnen, Audr ey et al. of the Prairie Island Indian Community to JoAnn Kyral, MNRRA Superintendent, letter, September 12, 2000). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 61 These statements express an oral tradition that documents the hi storical use of the Coldwater Spring by Dakota people for ceremonial purposes. Connections to Deities Springs are also associat ed with the Dakota deity Unktehi , who is described as wakan and the god associated with wa ter (Campbell 2000:26, 37; Dura nd 1994:96; Gary Cavender, key cultural expert, August 23, 2005). One or al history (described below) from key cultural expert Gary Cavender links Unktehi to Coldwater Spring. The Unktehi of the Dakota is not associated with one particular place, but he is everywhere that you find water that is active such as in springs or running water (Gary Cavender, key cultural expert, August 23, 2005).15 It is at these places, particularly the source of springs, that he manifests himself (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, June 21, 2005; Everett Black Thunder, pe rsonal communication, June 21, 2005). While Coldwater Spring is associated with the Unktehi by virtue of being a spring, Gary Cavender, Dakota elder and key cultura l expert, has specifically linked Unktehi to Coldwater Spring both during previous testim ony for the TH 55 Reroute project when he stated that \"our underwater God \"Unktehi\" lives in the Spring [Coldwater]\" (Cavender 1998), as well as during an interview fo r this study when he informed us that Unktehi \"lived in that tepee\" [ Taku Wakan Tipi ] and \"he would go into the river down that spring [referring specifically to Cold water Spring]\" (Gary Cavender, key cultural expert, August 23, 2005). In another forum, Gary Cavender said of Coldwater Spring: \"that sacred spring is the dwelling place of Unktahi - th e God of the Waters, and that is his passageway to get out into the world\" (C avender 1999). Leonard Wabasha (Cultural Resources Director, Shakopee Mdewakant on Dakota Community, July 21, 2005) and Jim Jones of the Minnesota Indian Affairs Counc il (April 7, 2005) had also heard of this tradition connecting Unktehi with Taku Wakan Tipi and Coldwater Spring. Unktehi is a revered and powerful bei ng that is hard to describe, but is said to resemble a transparent, amphibious ox-like animal that can take both male and female form (Campbell 2000:37; Pond 1889:219). According to Samuel Pond, the \"dwelling place of the male is in the water, and the spirit of the female animates the earth\" (Pond 1889:219). Unktehi is more to the Dakota, though, th an a dweller of water places; the Unktehi has \"existed since the beginning of time\" and is \"the connection between the human, the plants, and the animal world, and the philosoph y was that he always lies underneath the earth, and all things grow from him, such as trees, the roots, the plants, the waters, everything\" (Campbell 2000:38-39). The way of life of the early Mdewakanton and other Dakota included the medicine lodge , which was given to the Dakota by the Unktehi (Campbell 2000:38). The associa tion of the medicine lodge a nd medicine dance with the Unktehi again illustrates the connection between water/ Unktehi and healing (Pond 1889:220). 15 The Unktehi is described in Dakota as being both male and female, but in oral histories with current elders it is often referred to with the male pronoun \"he, \" particularly when referring to an association with water. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 62 Springs are said to be the breathing places of this deity (Pond 1889:219). Springs associated with Unktehi do not freeze over and it is always possible to see activity in the water (Cavender 1998). Due to th is association, springs are approached with caution and respect (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, October 25, 2005; Michael Selvage, Sr., key cultural expert, Oct ober 25, 2005). Tom Ross recalled being told as a boy to \"always be careful around springs...because th at's where the spirits are\" (October 25, 2005). For this reason, interviewees indicated, pl aces that are particular ly associated with Unktehi may be avoided, and if they are visited, an offering is left there (Dallas Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, June 21, 2005); Gary Cavender, a Dakota elder, stated that he offers tobacco to Maka Yusota (Boiling Springs) when he visits that location in Eden Prairie, Minnesota (August 23, 2005). Historical documentation and oral histories occasionally associate the Unktehi with specific geographic locations in addition to water sources in general. Two geographic locations within the vicinity of Coldwater Spring have been traditionally associated with the Unktehi : Oheyawahe and Taku Wakan Tipi. Oheyawahe (A Hill that is Much Visited), or Pilot Knob, is a prominent bluff lo cated to the southeast of the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers. Oheyawahe is said to have been pushed up, or created, by the Unktehi (Durand 1994:63-64) . Wakan), or Morgan's Mound, is a hill located to the immediate west of Coldwater Spring in the area of the Veteran Administration Hospital (Olle ndorf and Anderson 2004). This hill is regarded as the dwelling place of the Unktehi (Pond 1889:220; Durand 1994:86), and its cultural importance is \"strongly related to its proximity to Mdote \" (Ollendorf and Anderson 2004:12). The Unktehi is said to use a tunnel to access the Minnesota River from the hill (Eastman 1995:156; Durand 1994:86) . In oral testimonies, Coldwater Spring and its flow have been identified as the passageway, or one of the passageways, that the Unktehi uses to reach the river. As previ ously cited, Gary Cavender related [ Taku Wakan Tipi ] and \"he would go into the river down that spring [referring specifically to Coldwa ter Spring]\" (Gary Cavender, key cultural expert, August 23, 2005). Unktehi is also believed to inhabit the spring-fed lake within the cave that the Dakota call Wakan Tipi (Wakan House), or Carver's Cave, located along the Mississippi River at the foot of Dayton's Bluff in St. Paul (Terrell 2003b:72). Plant Resources During the course of the interviews, the Dakota interviewees did not identify any particular plant species that they know to exist within the TCRC property. Rather, the Dakota interviewees acknowledged that certain m edicinal plants are present only in the unique environment provided by natural spri ngs and their surroundings. They believe that the healing quality of the water and these plants are interconnected (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Communit y, October 25, 2005; Joe Will iams, key cultural expert, October 25, 2005). Interviewees also expressed an interest in th e potential to restore native plantings within the project area. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 63 Dakota Use of Project Area Dakota interviewees were asked about their use of Coldwater Spring and their knowledge of other users of the spring. During the course of this study, Dakota interviewees acknowledged using water from Coldwater Spring for Inipis and blessings. Leonard Wabasha, member of the Lower Sioux Indian Community, \"goes out into that area every December\" and has used the water from the spring for an Inipi (Leonard Wabasha, Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Community, June 21, 2005). Dakota key cultural expert Gary Cavender used the water fr om the spring for a blessing during the TH 55 Reroute project (Gary Cavender, key cultural expert, February 9, 2006). Mr. Cavender also recalls visiting the spring \"20 years ago and earlier\" (Gary Cavender, personal communication, August 9, 2005). Chris Leith, Dakota key cultural expert an d member of the Pr airie Island Indian Community, has used water from the spring for Inipis when people have brought the water down from the spring to his sweat lodge at the Prairie Isla nd Indian Community (Chris Leith, key cultural expert, September 22, 2005). While not afforded federal recognition, members of the Mendota Mdewakanton Dakota Community have held pipe ceremonies an d observed World Peace and Prayer Day (June 21) at the spring (Losure 2002:214; 225; Mich ael Scott, personal communication, June 23, 2005). Also, the mother of Jim Ande rson, tribal historian of the Mendota Mdewakanton Dakota Communit y, visited Coldwater Spring when she was a teenager (Jim Anderson, personal communication, Februa ry 9, 2006). Mr. Anderson's mother is now 72. Other Dakota tribal members, while unable to verify the use of this particular spring, acknowledge spring use in the area. Everet t Black Thunder, son of Sisseton-Wahpeton tribal historian Elijah Black Thunder learned from his father that people used springs \"especially in that area,\" but because the name of the spring is lost to him, he does not know if it was Coldwater Spring (Everett Blac k Thunder, key cultural expert, February 21, 2006). Others, like Curtis Campbell, elde r, historian, and Prairie Island Indian Community member, inherently believe that th e Dakota people that lived in the Mendota area would have used the spring (Curtis Campbell, Prairie Island Indian Community, September 20, 2005 and February 14, 2006). Pike's 1805 treaty was cited du ring interviews with offici al representatives of Dakota communities (June 21, 2005; October 25, 2005) and with non federally recognized Mendota Mdewakanton Dakota Community me mbers (June 24, 2005) as providing for continued access of American Indians to the TCRC property fo r these events, because the grounds of the TCRC are within the lands granted to Pike, and becau se Pike's treaty contained a clause that allowe d the Dakota to \"pass, repass, hunt or make other uses of the said district, as they have former ly done\" (Kappler 1904:1031) (Appendix I). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 64 OJIBWE INTERVIEWS Interviews with Ojibwe tribal members we re limited to one group interview with three official representatives from the federally recognized White Earth Band of Chippewa and one group interview with two members of offi cially recognized O jibwe communities - one of whom is a key cultural expert. Neither of the latter tribal members was representing their tribe in an official capacity. White Earth Band of Chippewa tribal historian Andy Favorit e provided an overview of Ojibwe visits to Fort Snelling including the 1837 treaty and meetings between the Ojibwe and the Dakota that were arranged by Indian Agent Lawrence Taliaferro (Andy Favorite, White Earth Band of Chippewa, July 26, 2005). Geographic Connections: Neutral Area During testimony for the TH 55 Reroute proj ect, key cultural expert Mr. Benton-Banai described a neutral area that encompassed both Minnehaha Falls (to the north of the TCRC) and the confluence of th e Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers (to the southeast of the TCRC) (Benton-Banai 1999). This description encompasses the area that was to be impacted by the disputed TH 55 project as well as the TCRC property: We know that the falls which came to be known as Minnehaha Falls, was a sacred place, was a neutral place, a place for many nations to come. And that [to] further geographically define [it], the confluence of the three rivers, which is actually the two rivers . That point was a neutral place. And that somewhere between that point and the falls there were sacred grounds that were mutually held to be a sacred place...The people that are concerned, the people that are identif ied are the Dakota, the Sauk, the Fox, the Potowatamie, the Wahpeton Dakotas, the Mdewakanton Dakotas, the Mesquakie people as all having us ed and recognizing and mutually agreeing that that is forever a neutral place and forever a sacred place. That is confirmed by our oral history. During our interview with Mr. Benton-Banai, he reiterated the inter-tribal neutrality of this area, \"The confluence here that was ve ry important to the pe ople\" and \"This whole area - I have no idea of bounda ries or lines, because ther e were none - was considered neutral territory and for the unrestricted us e of all native gather ings\" (August 30, 2005). This testimony also echoes the Dakota belief in the neutrality of Mdote as discussed in the section on Geographic Connections: Mdote . Water Resources It was noted that the Ojibwe equate wate r and springs with lif e (Andy Favorite, White Earth Band of Chippewa, July 26, 2005). Springs are consid ered by the Ojibwe to be particularly significant water sources. Wate r from springs is considered inherently pure because it comes directly out of the ground. For that reas on it can be used for sweat lodges and other ceremonies. On e Ojibwe interviewee said of springs, \"Knowing that it U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 65 came up through Mother Earth and that it wa s filtered in this loving caring way...and having an understanding of that... is why th ese things are treasured, because we know that is the purest water\" (Dorene Day, pe rsonal communication, A ugust 30, 2005). In the absence of access to a spring source, bottled spring water has been used by Ojibwe for sweat lodges and other ceremonies (Dor ene Day, personal communication, August 30, 2005). Coldwater Spring During the TH 55 Reroute project Ojibwe el der and key cultural expert Eddie Benton- Banai provided the following testimony regard ing the location of Coldwater Spring (Benton-Banai 1999:316-317): And that somewhere between that poi nt [the confluence] and the falls [Minnehaha Falls], there were sacred grounds that were again mutually held to be a sacred place. And that the spring from which the sacred water should be drawn was not very far, an d I've never heard any direction from which I could pinpoint, but that there's a spring near the lodge that all nations use to draw the sacred water for the ceremonies. Now that's in the words of our people of the [Mdewiwin] lodge. Of Ojibwe cultural observances at the sp ring he stated (Ben ton-Banai 1999:317-318): It is difficult even to estimate when the last sacred ceremony was held intertribally there, but my grandfat her who lived to be 108, died in 1942, and I will tell you this, that many times he re-told how we traveled, how he and his family, he as a small boy traveled by foot, by horse, by canoe to this great place to where there would be these great religious spiritual events, and that they always camped between the falls [Minnehaha] and the sacred water place. Those are his words. Mr. Benton-Banai stated that the water from th is particular spring is important, and that importance is related to th e location of the spring with in the neutral ground (Eddie Benton-Banai, key cultural expert, August 30, 2005). Ojibwe Use of Project Area Mr. Favorite resided in Minneapolis as a young man during the 1950s and would take the bus line to Fort Snelling State Park. He recalled that there was a spring that flowed across the path below the fenced Bureau of Mines property. He drank water from the spring, but at the time he did not know that this was Coldwater Spring (Andy Favorite, White Earth Band of Chippewa, July 26, 2005). Both Mr. Benton-Banai and Ms. Day have us ed the water from Coldwater Spring. Ms. Day credits her rediscovery of the spring to the TH 55 Reroute, and acknowledges that her own use of the spring for traditional cultural purposes dates back only to 1998 (Dorene Day, personal communi cation, August 30, 2005). Since this time Ms. Day, who U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 66 is a water woman of the Mdewiwin Lodge16, has been getting water from Coldwater Spring. She has performed water ceremonies at Coldwater Spring, prayed at the spring, and used water from the spring in other ce remonies including the sweat lodge (Dorene Day, personal communication, August 30, 2005). Mr. Benton-Banai's association with Coldwa ter Spring is much longer. Mr. Benton- Banai recalls going to the spring with his parents and a group of 50 or 60 people to perform a ceremony at the spring around 1949. He also visited the spring with a friend in 1973 when he was in the Twin Cities for an American Indian Move ment (AIM) gathering (Eddie Benton-Banai, key cultural expert , August 30, 2005). When Mr. Benton-Banai was director of the Red School House survival school in th e Twin Cities he visited the spring once or twice a month to gather wa ter for sweat lodges and ceremonies (Eddie Benton-Banai, key cultural expert, Febr uary 21, 2006). In 1998, Mr. Benton-Banai alerted members of the Ojibwe community to the TH 55 Rer oute project and its relationship to Coldwater Spring (Losure 2002:99). 16 The Mdewiwin Lodge (the heart way) has undergon e a revival within the Ojibwe community since the 1970s. Members of this group are characterized by a commitment to a daily consciousness associated with the traditional way of life. Within the Mdewiwin Lodge, women of the lodge are the keepers of water and perform water ceremonies. Women are associated with water because women are givers of life and water give life (Dorene Day, personal communication, August 30, 2005). Men within the lodge are associated with fire, which is necessary for life and family (Eddie Benton-Banai, key cultural expert, August 30, 2005). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 67 DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: COLDWATER SPRING Coldwater Spring and its envir ons have already been evalua ted for and nominated to the National Register of Historic Places for the role the site played in the EuroAmerican settlement of Minnesota. The primary objective of this study is to identify and document natural or cultural ethnographic resources present on the TCRC property that are considered to be traditionally meaningful by Am erican Indians. During the course of this study, Coldwater Spring was identified by the Dakota and Ojibwe community members interviewed as a cultural resource located within the boundaries of the TCRC property. This chapter discusses Coldwater Spring, dete rmines whether it is identified as an Ethnographic Resource; evaluate s its potential for listing in the National Register; assesses if the basis exists for determining this resource to be a TCP; and determines whether it is a Sacred Site. COLDWATER SPRING : ETHNOGRAPHIC RESOURCE IDENTIFICATION This place is so intrinsic to a way of life that not only does it deserve preservation and restoration, but it is much deeper than that...it is necessary to the surv ival of the people. Spiritual survival rests on the restoration of these places. - Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, October 25, 2005 One of the stated objectives of this study wa s to document the presence, or absence, of natural or cultural ethnographi c resources within the TCRC project area. The concept and definition of an \"ethnographic resource\" as described in this section of the report, was devised by the NPS as an internal manage ment tool for natural and cultural resources that are assigned cultural significance by trad itional users (NPS 1998). Therefore, while the definition of an ethnographic re source is borrowed from the NPS Cultural Resource Management Guideline (NPS 1998) for the purpose of assessing the presence, or absence, of these types of resources within the T CRC property, the formal designation of an ethnographic resource and associated manage ment policies are only applicable to NPS- owned properties. Ethnographic resources are cultural and natura l features that trad itionally associated peoples recognize as being \"clos ely linked with their own sense of purpose, existence as a community, and development as ethnically distinctive peoples\" (NPS 2001:57). These peoples, for purposes of the NPS, \"are the contemporary park neighbors and ethnic or occupational communities that have been associated with a park for two or more generations (40 years), and w hose interests in the park's resources began prior to the park's establishment\" (NPS 2001:57). Ethnogra phic resources may be sites, landscapes, structures, objects, or natural resources such as plants, animals, minerals, and bodies of water that are assigned traditional legendary, religious, subsistence, or other significance in the cultural system of a group traditionally associated with them. Examples include U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 68 places that \"support ceremonial activities or represent birthplaces of significant individuals, group origin sites, migration routes, or harves ting or collecting places\" (NPS 2001:57). These resources can be categori zed as ethnographic resources when the associated peoples perceive them to be trad itionally meaningful to their identity as a group and the survival of their lifeways (NPS 1998). During the course of this study, the TCRC pr operty was identified by both federally recognized and non federally recognized Md ewakanton Dakota interviewees as being part of the historically and cultural significant landscape of Mdote at the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers. The Coldwater Spring within the TCRC was identified by both Dakota and Ojibwe people interviewed as a natu ral resource important in their traditional culture. For the Dakota, the spring is pe rceived as cont ributing to the survival of their lifeway as a source of pure natural spring water use in ceremonies, such as the Inipi, and as a habitat for associated cere monial and medicinal plants, essential components of traditionally meaningful cerem onies. Likewise, the Ojibwe people who we interviewed perceived that the spring contribut ed to the survival of their traditions and ceremonies, particularly the activities of the Mdewiwin lodge, that requ ire natural spring water. Coldwater Spring has additional significance for the Dakota because of its association with the deity Unktehi. These testimonies have le d to the identification of Coldwater Spring as an ethnogr aphic natural resource. There are four major categories of ethnographi cally significant natu ral resources: plants, animals, minerals, and bodies of water. Co ldwater Spring is defined as a body of water, which can include springs and seeps, and a ha bitat for significant cultural plants. The traditional groups associated with this res ource are the Dakota and Ojibwe peoples. A traditionally associated group is defined as a social/cultural entity such as a tribe, community, or kinship unit that is traditionally associated with an area when (1) the entity regards the resource(s) as essential to its development and c ontinued identity as a culturally distinct people; (2) the association has endured for at least two generations (40 years); and (3) the association began prior to establishment of the park (for purposes of the NPS) (NPS 2001:130). While Dakota and Ojibwe people interviewed regard Coldwater Spring as a resource of cultural importance, their history and their phys ical isolation from the spring has resulted in a lack of evidence of association with the resource for the pa st two generations. However, ethnographically significant natural resources are defined by their importance to the groups traditionally associated with them, and not by thei r association with a specific landscape, place, or object. Therefor e, because the traditions held by the Dakota and Ojibwe that use natural spring water, such as the Inipi , are seminal to their development and continued existence as an ethnically distinct people, and because they have been practicing these traditions for at least two or more generations, Coldwater Spring is defined as an ethnographically sign ificant natural resource by virtue of its association with these traditions and the gr oups that practice them using the water from the spring. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 69 COLDWATER SPRING : TRADITIONAL CULTURAL PROPERTY The U.S. Department of the Interior pr ovides specific guidelin es and criteria for evaluating if a property is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The purpose of the National Regist er is to recognize historic properties that reflect the diversity of the nation's history and culture. Properties eligible for listing in the National Register may reflect many kinds of historical significance including traditional cultural significance. \"Traditional\" in this use refers to \"those beliefs, customs, and practices of a living community of people that have been passed down through the generations, usually orally or through practice\" (P arker and King 1998:1). A TCP is a building, structure, site, object, or district that is significant because of the role it plays in the living community's \"historically rooted beliefs, customs, a nd practices\" (Parker a nd King 1998:1). These practices or beliefs area \"(a) are rooted in that community's history, and (b) are important in maintaining the continuing cultural iden tity of the community\" (Parker and King 1998:1). National Register Bulletin 38 provi des specific guidelines for the evaluation and documentation of TCPs for the National Register (Parker and King 1998). The steps outlined in Bulletin 38 are: \u0083 Step One: Ensure that the entity under consideration is a property \u0083 Step Two: Consider the property's in tegrity of relationship and condition \u0083 Step Three: Evaluate the pr operty with reference to the National Register criteria \u0083 Step Four: Determine whether any of the Na tional Register criteria considerations make the property ineligible The following sections describe the applic ation of these steps to Coldwater Spring. Step One: Ensure that the entity under consideration is a property The National Register guidelines require th at a cultural resource undergoing evaluation be identifiable as a tangible property. Prope rty types accepted to the National Register include buildings, structures, sites, objects , or districts. As Dakota testimony has identified the source of the spring, its flow, and the water associated with it as the salient features of Coldwater Spring and not the exis ting spring house and re servoir walls, which were constructed in the nineteenth century, Coldwater Spring is neither a building nor a structure, which are defined as necessarily being constructed by human beings. Sites, objects, and districts, though, do not have to be produced by human beings. A \"site\" is defined as the location of a significant even t, occupation, or activity, \"where the location itself possesses historic, cultural, or archeologi cal value\" regardless of whether or not the event or activity left any evidence of its occu rrence (NPS 2002; Parker and King 1998:9). Among the examples of sites listed in National Register Bulletin 15 is a \"natural feature (such as a rock formation) having cultura l significance\" (NPS 2002). Coldwater Spring has been identified during the course of this study as a natural spring that is culturally significant for its association with: U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 70 \u0083 the Mdote area at the confluence of the Minneso ta and Mississippi rivers, which is regarded as the center of all things and historically significant by the Mdewakanton Dakota; \u0083 the Dakota tradition of the Unktehi ; and \u0083 the activity of collecting spri ng water for ceremonial use. While Bulletin 38 suggests that a natural feature, such as a tree or rock outcrop that is associated with a significant tradition, may be classified as an object, the description of an \"object\" in the more recently revised Bu lletin 15 is limited to \"constructions that are primarily artistic in nature or are relatively small in scale and simply constructed\" (NPS 2002). As Coldwater Spring is not a \"construction,\" and its si gnificance is linked to the underground source of the water as well as th e flow of the water away from the spring mouth, it seems more appropriate to identify the spring as a site rather than as an object. A district is a \"concentration, linkage, or continuity of such sites or objects, or of structures comprising a cultu rally significant entity\" (Parke r and King 1998:9). During this study it was repeatedly suggested by Dakota interviewees that the entire Mdote area, of which Coldwater Spring is a part, consists of numerous places of cultural significance to the Dakota and that one object or site cannot necessarily be divorced from the others. As the concept of this district, and the cultu rally significant entity, or linkage, it embodies is beyond the ability of this curre nt study to define, the notion of a Mdote cultural district is further explored in the recomm endations section of this report. With regard, therefore, to step one of the evaluation a nd documentation of Coldwater Spring as a TCP, the entity is a property, and in particular, it is identified as a site (a natural spring) that is associated with the traditions of Mdote , the Unktehi , and the use of natural springs by Dakota people as a source of water for ceremonies. Step Two: Consider the property's in tegrity of relationship and condition The National Register requires that listed properties retain integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association. For TCPs , these concepts of integrity are summarized in the following two questions about th e property's integrity (Parker and King 1998:10): \u0083 Does the property have an integral relationship to traditional cultural practices or beliefs? \u0083 Is the condition of the pr operty such that the releva nt relationships survive? Integrity of Relationship According to Bulletin 38, \"if the property is known or likely to be regarded by a traditional cultural group as important in the re tention or transmittal of a belief, or to the performance of a practice, the property can be taken to have an integral relationship with the belief or practice, and vi ce-versa.\" The property of Coldwater Spring has been identified as a site (a natural spring) that is associated with the landscape of Mdote ; the U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 71 Dakota belief that the Unktehi is manifested at springs; and with the use of natural spring water in both Dakota ceremonies. While the association of the Unktehi with springs such as Coldwater Spring was mentioned during several interv iews, the relationship of Unktehi to Coldwater Spring was not emphasized as one of primary importance in terms of the prop erty's significance. Rather, natural springs were repeatedly iden tified during interviews as significant water sources, because spring water is inherently pur e and has healing capabilities. For this reason, natural spring water is integral to th e creation of medicine, and the performance of ceremonies that require pure water such as the Inipi, or sweat lodge. Coldwater Spring is inherently recognized by the Dakota elders interviewed as the type of spring that would have been used by their forebears in the pe rformance of traditional practices requiring pure water, even though they are no longer able to identify th e particular users or period of use. It is known, though, that the spri ng was located within Dakota territory and is associated with the historically and culturally significant Mdote area. It has also been associated with the first village, Ti Tanka Tanina, at the confluence. By virtue, therefore, of being a natural spring that was part of the cultur ally significant Dakota landscape, Coldwater Spring is regarded by the Dakota interviewed as a significant water source that is important to the performance of thei r historically rooted practices. Coldwater Spring is currently being used by both federally recognized and non federally recognized Dakota tribal members as a s ource of natural spring water for use in traditional practices including sweat lodges. Furthermore, the spring is regarded as important to the retention and continued perf ormance of traditional practices requiring natural spring water, particularly for Dakot a who reside in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. \"This place is so intrinsic to a way of life that not onl y does it deserve preservation and restoration, but it is much deeper than th at...it is necessary to the survival of the people. Spiritual survival rests on the restoration of these places\" (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, October 25, 2005). As such, Coldwater Spring has an integral relationship to the performance of historically rooted cultural practices that have been identified as important in maintaining the c ontinuing cultural ident ity of Dakota people. Integrity of Condition During the nineteenth century, a spring house and reservoir were c onstructed around the natural spring source. Subsequently, during the twentieth century, the Bureau of Mines campus was constructed around the location of the spring. During th ese transformations of the property, the spring con tinued to flow. Today, the spring house has fallen into disrepair, and the spring once again emanates from the ground. During the interviews for this study, the interviewees were questioned about the transformations that have taken place on the property and whether they impact the integrity of the spring. The general consensus is that since the water of the spring still flows from the ground, the integrity of location and association, and hence the integr ity of the spring as a traditional property, has not been impacted despite changes to the spring's setting. The spring, the water it U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 72 emits, and the habitat for medicinal and cerem onial plants it could support, retain the qualities that make Coldwater Spring a signi ficant cultural place. In keeping with Bulletin 38, if the integrity has not been lost in the eyes of the associated community, it likely retains sufficient integr ity to justify further evalua tion (Parker and King 1998:10). Step Three: Evaluate the property with re ference to the National Register criteria Having established that Coldwater Spring is a property that retains integrity of relationship and condition, the thir d step is to evaluate the pr operty against the four basic National Register criteria. In order for a pr operty to be potentially eligible for the National Register it must meet one of or more of the criteria. Criterion A - association with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; Criterion B - association with the lives of persons significant in our past; Criterion C - embodiment of the distinctiv e characteristics of a type, period or method of construction; repres entation of the work of a master; possession of high artistic values; or representation of a si gnificant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or Criterion D - potential to yi eld information important in prehistory or history. Criterion A: Association with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history. Under Criterion A, a TCP may be eligible for the National Register if it is associated with events, which are defined as specific moments in history or a series of events that reflect a broad pattern or theme. The \"our\" in Crite rion A is understood to refer to the group for which the property may have traditional cultural significance (Parker and King 1998:11). Bulletin 38 further notes that the event, or se ries of events, should be closely associated with the property and can be documented through accepted means of research (Parker and King 1998:11). In the case of traditional properties, th ough, and in particular those associated with traditional events, accepted m eans of research are often unable to verify the event (e.g., a crea tion story) (Parker and King 1998:11). During the course of this study, interv iewees identified the TCRC property and Coldwater Spring as part of the landscape of Mdote - a historically and culturally significant location surrounding the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers. Mdote is considered by the Mdewakanton Dakota to be the middle of all things and the exact center of the earth or Makoce Cokaya Kin (Cavender 1988:13; Durand 1994:56; one Mdewakanton Dakota belief, Mdote Minisota is associated with th e event of the Dakota creation (Cavender 1988:13). While the boundaries of Mdote have not been formally defined, th e interviewees indicated that it includes the bluff tops surrounding the conflu ence, including the TCRC property (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, June 21, 2005; Gary Cavender, key cultural expert, August 9 and August 23, 2005; Jim Anderson, personal communication, June 24, 2005). A map created by the Shakopee Mdew akanton Dakota Community (2003) in U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 73 consultation with their elders, also includes Mni Sni (Coldwater Spring ), and thereby at least a portion of the TCRC property, within Mdote (see Figure 10). Associated with Mdote are numerous locations of cultural impo rtance to the Dakota, including sacred landmarks, ceremonial gathering spots, habita tion sites, and important events in Dakota history (Terrell 2003a:81-82). Exampl es of used 1837 initia tion ceremony and 1848 medicine dance \u0083 Dakota burials on Oheyawahe \u0083 1805 Treaty with the Sioux (Pike Treaty) \u0083 Pike Island \u0083 1841 Doty Mendota Wahpekute and Mdewakanton bands \u0083 1862 Dakota interment camp below Fort Snelling The occurrence of these significant events w ithin a radius around the physical confluence is a testimony for the Dakota of the central ity and power of this location (Cavender 1999). While the TCRC property and Cold water Spring is associated with Mdote by the accounts of federally recognized and non federally recognized Dakot a interviewees, the oral history related by Dakota elder and key cultural ex pert Gary Cavender associates Coldwater Spring directly with the event of the Mdote creation: \"The water from Coldwater Springs comes out from underneath th e land and so some of the spirit beings that arrived went into the water and they appeared on earth here and so became Dakotahs\"(Gary Cavender, key cultural expert, August 9, 2005) . Therefore, Coldwater Spring is recommended as eligible for the National Register unde r Criterion A when evaluated as a TCP for its association with Mdote . Criterion B: Association with the lives of persons significant in our past. For the purpose of trad itional cultural properties, the word \"persons\" in Criterion B is not limited to tangible human beings, but can refe r to \"gods and demigods who feature in the traditions of a group\" (Parker and King 1998:11). By virtue of being a natural spring, Coldwater Spring is associated with the Dakota deity Unktehi . Springs are said to be the breathing places of this deity (Pond 1889:219), and the Unktehi may manifest itself at the spring. Unlike the other sites de scribed previously in this te xt as being associated with as Coldwater cannot be associated with the Unktehi through the property's name or historical documentation. While one oral trad ition was shared that relates the deity to Coldwater Spring, properties listed on th e National Register under Criterion B are generally restricted to those that can be directly li nked to the person and the person's significant achievements (Cavender 1999; Gary Cavender, key cult ural expert, August 23, 2005). Because the Unktehi 's association with this spring is no more significant than his association with any other spring (Gary Cavender, key cu ltural expert, February 9, 2006; Curtis Campbell, Prairie Island Indi an Community, February 14, 2006), Coldwater U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 74 Spring is not recommended as e ligible for listing in the Na tional Register under Criterion B. Criterion C: (1) Embodiment of the distinctive characteri stics of a type, period or methods of construction; (2) representative of the work of a master;(3) possession of high artistic values; or (4) repres entative of a significant and di stinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction. Criterion C is comprised of four statements, only one of which needs to be met in order for a property to be considered potentiall y eligible for the National Register under Criterion C. For the purposes of convenience, Bulletin 38 sepa rates Criterion C into four subcriterions in order to describe the app lication of each statemen t to potential TCPs (Parker and King 1998:11 fn12). Subcriterion 1 (embodiment of the distinctive charac teristics of a type, period or methods of construction) applies to c onstructed properties. As alre ady discussed under step one, the traditional cultural significance of Coldwa ter Spring is not associated with the built environment of the spring house and reservoi r walls. As Coldwater Spring is not a building, structure, or built object, it ca nnot embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of c onstruction. Coldwater Spring is therefore not recommended as eligible for the National Register under Cr iterion C-1. Subcriterion 2 of Criteria C (re presentative of the work of a master) is reserved for properties that are identified as having been the work of a tr aditional master builder or artisan. Again, as Coldwater Spring is not a constructed property it cannot be representative of the work of a master. Coldwater Spri ng is therefore not recommended as eligible for the National Register under Criterion C-2. Subcriterion 3 of Criterion C (possession of high artist ic values) may apply to a traditional property containing art work, includ ing petroglyphs or pictographs, which are valued by the community for traditional cultu ral reasons. As Coldwater Spring is not associated with any art work, it is not recommended as eligible for the National Register under Criterion C-3. Subcriterion 4 of Criterion C (representative of a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinc tion) is interpreted in Bulletin 38 as not limited to constructed properties. Rather it states that \"a property may be regarded as representative of a significan t and distinguishable entity, even though it lacks individual distinction, if it represents or is an integral part of a larger entity of traditional cultural importance\" (Parker and King 1998:12). One of the examples given to illustrate this subcriteria are natural features , such as outcrops and groves of trees in Micronesia that are \"indistinguishable visually (at least to the outside observer) from other rocks and trees, but they figure importan tly in chants embodying tradi tional sailing di rections and lessons about traditional histor y. As individual objects th ey lack distinction, but the larger entity of which they are a part - Micr onesian navigational and historical tradition - is of prime importance in the area's hist ory\" (Parker and King 1998:12). Using this U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 75 example as a model, Coldwater Spring is a natu ral spring that is indistinguishable to the casual observer from any other natural spri ng. For the Dakota, Coldwater Spring is imbued with cultural impor tance, because of its association with the cultural landscape of Mdote and because springs figure significantly in the practice of their traditional ceremonies, in particular the Inipi, that require pure water for their performance. While Coldwater Spring may lack distinction as an individual spring, it is representative of the type of natural springs (ma ny of which have been dest royed or which are no longer accessible) that are significant for their role in Dakota traditional lifeways. Hence, Coldwater Spring and springs like it are inte gral to the continued observance of these rituals. Coldwater Spring is therefore recommended as eligible for the National Register under Criterion C-4. Criterion D: History of yi elding, or potential to yield, information important in prehistory or history. Typically Criterion D is applie d to archaeological sites that have yielded, or may yield, significant cultural information. While a TCP may include an archaeological component, typically Criterion D is not applicable to TCPs or only describes a secondary association. In the case of Coldwater Spring, the property, as a natural feature, does not have the potential to yield important information in prehistory or history. Coldwater Spring is therefore not recommended as eligible for the National Register under Criterion D. Step Four: Determine whether any of the National Register Criteria Considerations make the property ineligible The National Register typically excludes properties that can be described by one or more of the six criteria considerations. Th e considerations are discussed below. Consideration A: Ownership by a religious institution or use for religious purposes According to National Register Bulletin 15, a re ligious property \"requires justification on architectural, artistic, or historic grounds to avoid any appearance of judgment by government about the validity of any religion or belief\" (NPS 2002). As stated in Bulletin 38, the application of th is consideration to TCPs is \"fraught with the potential for ethnocentrism and discrimination,\" because Eu roAmericans may perceive an activity to be \"religious,\" although it may not be ascribed that status by the practitioner (Parker and King 1998:13). This is often the case with Am erican Indian properties, because culture, history, and religion are so intertwined that they cannot necessarily be parsed out. In applying Consideration A to TCPs , Bulletin 38 notes that \"the f act that a property is used for religious purposes by a traditional group, such as seeking supernatural visions, collecting or preparing native medicines, or carrying out ceremonies, or is described by the group in terms that are classified by the outside observer as 're ligious' should not by itself be taken to make the property ineligible, since these activities may be expressions of traditional cultural beliefs and may be intrinsic to the continuation of traditional cultural beliefs\" (Parker and King 1998:13). While the TCRC property is not owned by a religious institution, the Coldwater Spring is used as a source of pure water for carrying out ceremonies. These activitie s are expressions of traditional cultural beliefs that are U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 76 historically rooted and which cannot be divorced from the continued pursuit of the traditional lifeways of Dakota people. Hence, while these activities may be considered \"religious,\" such consideration does not make the practice of collecting water from the spring any less historically root ed, or culturally significant, and, therefore, does not make the property ineligible under Consideration A for listing in the National Register. Consideration G: Significance achieved within the past 50 years In order for a property to be considered eligible for listing in the National Register, it cannot have achieved its associated signi ficance within the 50 years preceding the evaluation. Furthermore, as noted in Bulletin 38, a property that has achieved significance within the last 50 years certainly cannot be considered \"traditional\" (Parker and King 1998:15). While many of the Da kota and Ojibwe tribal members and individuals that we spoke with during this study credited their redisc overy of the spring to the TH 55 reroute, and acknowledged that th eir own use of the spring for traditional cultural purposes dates back only to 1998 or more recently, the presence of the spring can be documented in the historical record as far back as 1 820. At that time, the area surrounding the spring was occupied by the United States military during the construction of Fort Snelling. Prior to th at event, Coldwater Spring wa s located within acknowledged historical Dakota territory and within a portion of that territory that was granted to the United States Government in Pike's treaty of 1805. This treaty, which was signed by the chiefs of the two Mdewakanton Dakota communities that resided closest to the confluence, created a military reservati on at the junction of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers. The Dakota tribal memb ers interviewed during our study inherently recognize that Coldwater Spring would have been important to, and used by, the Dakota people who occupied the confluence area, including the inhabitants of Ti Tanka Tanina , the first Dakota village at the confluence, prior to the land becoming government property. The history of the Dakota pe ople in Minnesota, including th eir exile, the boarding school education system, and the outlawing of their religious practices until 1978, has made it, as one interviewee said, \"practically impossibl e\" for them to have retained a continuous relationship with places of cultural significance . Furthermore, as one interviewee noted, this history of oppression is ve ry recent, and it is still very present in the consciousness of Dakota communities. In the 1880's, formal prohibitions were carried out on Indian spiritual practices, the Sun Dance, and other ceremonies. Sharon O'Brien, (1996) explains that in 1932, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, John Collier (appointed by Franklin Roosevelt), oversaw the formal end to these prohibitions, however, in addition to profound and widespread prej udice, their remained many ob stacles to American Indian spiritual practice. For example, O'Brien explains some American Indians were arrested for possession of sacred eagle feathers, pol ice arrested American Indians who used peyote in religious ceremony, cu stoms officials expos ed and destroyed medicine bundles and didn't allow American Indians to transpor t sacred plants and animals across borders, archaeologists and museums denied proper burial rights and access to sacred sites on public and private land was prevented. In addition, Christians continued to induce American Indians to convert their spirituality to Christian religious faith. After proposals U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 77 and significant lobbying by American Indians to change legislation, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (Public Law 95-341) wa s enacted in 1978 in an effort to respond to various widespread actions by both privat e and public entities th at posed significant impediments to American Indian spiritual practices. However, until 1978, the enormity of these impediments effectively made Ameri can Indian spiritual practices very difficult (and in many cases impossible) to practice (Howard Vogel, pers onal communication, February 27, 2006). Due to the exile, Ameri can Indians that once traditionally occupied the Minnesota and Mississippi ri ver valleys now reside throu ghout Minnesota, as well as in North and South Dakota, Nebraska, and in Canada. Due to this history, the continuity of all land-based cultural pract ices was broken for a period of time and now only a few Dakota elders retain traditional knowledge that they learned from their grandparents and other elders in their communities (Ollendorf and Anderson 2004:16). It is these elders that currently assert that Coldwater Spring is the type of spring that would have been used as a source of water for ceremonies by the Dakota occupants of the Mdote area. In recent years, since the \"rediscovery\" of the spring, members of federally recognized Dakota and Ojibwe communities, and other Da kota and Ojibwe individuals, have once again begun to use the spring as a source of water for ceremonies. It has been suggested that if Coldwater Spring was a loca tion of cultural importance to the Dakota prior to the TH 55 Reroute project, the events that took place there would have been observed and recorded by contempo rary authors, such as the Pond brothers, who lived within the area of the fort and wrote about the Dakota. As noted earlier, though, the activity of gathering water from a spring for ceremonies may not have been considered a noteworthy activ ity, as might the ceremony, which could have occurred elsewhere in the Mdote area, or at some further distan ce. The only activities described during the course of this study are the coll ection of spring water and offerings for the water itself or the Unktehi . 17 Furthermore, while physical access to the spring was only limited during the Bureau of Mines period, interv iewees noted that the relationship of the spring to Fort Snelling and its use by the military would have made it an uncomfortable place. Also, when the Ojibwe came to the fort , they camped in the vicinity of Coldwater Spring. The presence of the Ojibwe at the spring would have deterred Dakota encroachment into this area in order to avoid conflict in the vicinity of Fort Snelling. In her ethnographic research on the hill known as Taku Wakan Tipi or Morgan's Mound, Carolyn Anderson concluded that \"a lack of descriptive information by non-Natives for Taku Wakan Tipi is likely not an accurate reflection of its great importance to the Dakota. Instead, the lack of such descriptions is more likely the result of a large part of Taku Wakan Tipi being part of the military reservation and other parts of the landform being encompassed by some of the earliest non-Na tive settlements. Both factors, in her opinion, greatly limited Dakota access to Taku Wakan Tipi \" (Ollendorf and Anderson 2004:16). The same could certainly be said of Coldwater Spring, which is located to the 17 Elders interviewed described leaving tobacco as an offering. Skinner documents the Wahpeton Dakota ceremony of dog offerings to the Unktehi : \"Four times a year a dog must be slain and thrown into the water for the great spirits, the Unktehi. These dogs sacrificed must also be covered with red and white down\" (Skinner 1920:278). It is not known if this ceremony was observed by the Mdewakanton Dakota. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 78 east of Taku Wakan Tipi and is therefore closer to the fort and more centrally located within the early EuroAmerican settlement of Camp Coldwater. National Register Bulletin 38 specifically addresses properties with histories of use like that of Coldwater Spring. The bulletin states (Parker and King 1998:16): The fact that a property may have gone unused for a lengthy period of time, with use beginning again only recently, does not make the property ineligible for the Register. To illustrate this point, an example is given in the bulletin of a hypothetical Indian tribe that used a mountain peak in prehistory for communication with the supernatural, but the tribe had to abandon that use due to its removal and confinemen t to a distant reservation. Due to a revitalization of traditional religion within the last decade, the Indian tribe once again begins to use the peak to perform vi sion quests similar to those carried out in prehistory. According to the bulletin (Parker and King 1998:16): The fact that the contemporary use of the peak has little continuous time depth does not make the peak ineligib le; the peak's association with the traditional activity reflected in its contemporary use is what must be considered in determining eligibility. Similarly, Dr. Alan Downer, Department Mana ger, Navajo Nation Historic Preservation Department, maintains that in determining TCP status, \"the fifty year guideline\" can appropriately be applied to the practice or tradition a place facilitate s; that a TCP may be eligible if it sustains or is used in an ancient tradition w hether or not it can be demonstrated conclusively t hat people have used the specific place in question for the 50 years (emphasis added) (Alan Downer to Penny Rucks, electronic communication, December 15, 2005). In other words, according to the National Regi ster guidelines and their application to TCPs, it is not the \"use\" of the property that mu st be 50 years or older, but the associated \"significance\" or tradition. In the case of Coldwater Sprin g, the associated significance has been identified as that of a natural spring water source for the practice of Dakota traditional ceremonies that require pure water for their performance. The historically rooted observance of these practices, including the use of springs a nd the performance of the Inipi, can be documented through accepted m eans of research and have been demonstrated in this report to be 50 years or older. In 2000, the elected officials of the Prairie Island Indian Community wrote (Let ter to JoAnn Kyral, MNRRA Superintendent, September 12, 2000): Our own history tells us that the sp ring was used in Dakota Healing Lodge because of its purity. River or lake water would never have been used in the healing lodge; only the pure water from the spring could be used. Because of this important use and cu ltural connection, we feel that the U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 79 protection of the site [Coldwater Spri ng] from any development is critical. We are relying on the Department of the Interior to assure us that the site will forever be protected and Dakota people will have access to the site. While, therefore, no oral traditions or hist orical accounts were sh ared or discovered during this study that document on-site cultural practices at Coldwater Spring that are 50 years or older, the practice or tradition asso ciated with the spring's current use can be documented to be older than 50 years. It is also asserted by Dakota elders that Coldwater Spring is the type of spring that would have b een used in prehistory as a source of water for ceremonies by the Dakota occupants of the Mdote area, including th e occupants of Ti Tanka Tanina, the \"old village,\" and it is currently being used by members of federally recognized Dakota and Ojibwe communities, an d other Dakota and Ojibwe individuals, as a source of water for histor ically rooted ceremonies. Coldwater Spring is, therefore, considered exempt from Consideration G. Coldwater Spring is exempt from all of the following considerations and they require no further discussion: Consideration B: Relocated properties Consideration C: Birthplaces and graves Consideration D: Cemeteries Consideration E: Reconstruction Consideration F: Commemoration Synthesis As a result of this evaluation, Coldwater Spri ng is recommended as being significant at the statewide level as a TCP associated w ith the Dakota communities in Minnesota. The spring is recommended as elig ible for the National Regist er under Criterion A for its association with Mdote . The spring is also recommended as eligible under National Register Criterion C as represen tative of the type of natura l springs (many of which have been destroyed or which are no longer accessible) that figure significantly in Dakota traditional practices and are important for th e continued maintenance of their cultural identity. Visible and Non-Visible Characteristics Identified visible characteri stics of Coldwater Spring are the point at which the water emits from the ground; the flow of that wa ter; the associated pool/reservoir; and the eventual flow of the water to the Mississipp i River. Non-visible characteristics of Coldwater Spring are its associ ation with the Dakota deity Unktehi and the Dakota cultural landscape of Mdote . Period of Significance Assigning a period of significance to a TCP is \"usually fruitless, and of little or no relevance to the eligibility of the prope rty involved for inclusion on the National U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 80 Register\" (Parker and King 1998:17). Dakota oral traditions associate the spring with the Dakota creation at Mdote as well as with the \"old village\" of Ti Tanka Tanina. The significance and use of the spring continues to th e present day. Boundaries Based on conversations with Dakota and Ojib we communities during this study, there is a consensus that the boundaries of Coldwater Spring would include not only where the water flows from the rock wall, but also where the spring originates (watershed) as well as the path the spring water takes to the Mississippi River and the habitat created for medicinal and ceremonial plants. Additional consultation is needed to define the boundaries of Mdote that encompass Coldwater Spring. COLDWATER SPRING : SACRED SITE DETERMINATION According to the Executive Order (E.O.) 13007, a \"sacred site\" is defined as \"any specific, discrete, narrowly delineated locati on on Federal land\" that is identified by a federally recognized Indian tribe, or member of such an Indian tribe determined to be an appropriated authoritative representative, as \"s acred by virtue of its established religious significance to, or ceremonial use by, an Indian religion; provided that the tribe or appropriately authoritative representative of an Indian religion has informed the agency of the existence of such a si te.\" According to Section 1 of E.O. 13007, the executive branch with administrative ju risdiction over the site , should, to the ex tent practicable, \"(1) accommodate access to and ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites by Indian religious practitioners and (2) avoid advers ely affecting the physical integrit y of such sacred sites.\" During the course of this study, it was communicated to the authors by Tom Ross, an official tribal representative from the federally-recognized Upper Sioux Indian Community, that \"the site itself is a sacred place\" (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, June 21, 2005), while Chris Leith, a key Dakota cultural expert, who is an enrolled member of the federally-recogni zed Prairie Island I ndian Community, has previously testified during the TH 55 reroute project that the spring at Camp Coldwater is \"sacred to the Indians\" (Leith 1998). Gary Cavender, a key Dakota cultural expert, who is not enrolled in a federally-recognized community, has also identified Coldwater Spring during testimony for the TH 55 re route project as \"a sacred spring\" a nd during the current study as \"a sacred place\" (Cavender 1998; Gary Cavender, key cultural expert, August 9, 2005). Eddie Benton-Banai, a key Ojibwe cultura l expert and an enro lled member of the federally-recognized Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Ojibwe, stated that Coldwater Spring was \"considered sacred by all who drew water\" (Eddie Benton-Banai, key cultural expert, August 30, 2005). While it has been communicated to the author s of this study by members of federally recognized tribes that Coldwater Spring is a sacred site, the declaration of a \"sacred site,\" requires an official request from a federally re cognized tribe or an official declaration by the recognized religious leader of a federally recognized tribe with specific evidence about its sacred character and history. The authors of this report, therefore, can only U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 81 convey that Coldwater Spring has been identifie d during interviews as a \"sacred site.\" Official designation of the spring as such must originate within federally recognized tribal communities. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 82 HISTORICAL AND CULT URAL DESIGNATIONS Several existing historical and cultural designations encompass portions of the TCRC property or immediately adjace nt lands (Figure 11). This section describes the current designations, their identi fied areas of historical and cu ltural significance, and associated boundaries. It also provides a summary of previously completed archaeological and historical studies within th e property and the recommendati ons that those studies made for adjustments to the existing resource bounda ries. Lastly, the re sults of the current study are integrated with the previous studi es in order to make a recommendation for appropriate designations and associated boundaries. CURRENT HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL DESIGNATIONS Fort Snelling National Historic Landmark Fort Snelling was designated a National Hist oric Landmark (NHL) in 1960 pursuant to the Historic Sites Act of 1935. National Hist oric Landmarks are na tionally significant historic places that possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States. Fort Snelling is recognized for its role as the first American fort in modern Minnesota, which was an important post on the edge of EuroAmerican settlement. Additionally, the fort played a si gnificant role in the transformation of the U.S. Army from a small frontier force to that of a major modern army (NPS 2005). Boundaries of the Fort Snelling NHL were not established at the time of its designation, although the area would have been limited to federal lands (Scott Anfinson, SHPO National Register Archaeol ogist, to Dennis Gimmestad, SHPO Government Programs and Compliance Officer, memorandum, Februa ry 2, 1998). In 1999, the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places stated that the official boundary for the NHL was established in 1978 and that it consists of two discontiguous areas encompassing approximately 300 acres and the locations of Old Fort Snelli ng (including Camp Coldwater and the steamboat landing), and the Department of Dakota buildings (Figure 11) (Carol D. Schull, Keeper of the Nationa l Register of Historic Places, to Britta Bloomberg, Deputy State Historic Preservation Officer, letter, May 7, 1999). Within the TCRC property, the boundary of the NHL is defined by the 800-foot contour line as recorded on the 1967 version of the Saint Paul West Quadrant of the U.S.G.S. 7.5-minute map series. This boundary only includes a port ion of the reservoir associated with the Coldwater Spring (Figure 12). The spring itself is outside of the NHL boundary. Fort Snelling National Register Historic District When the National Register was created in 1966 all recognized NHL properties were automatically listed. Therefore, Fort Snel ling was listed on the National Register on October 14, 1966 with the enac tment of the National Histor ic Preservation Act. The initial boundaries of the distri ct were the same as those of the landmark. In 1969, though, a formal National Register nomination form was prepared for the property and entered into the register on February 16, 1970 (Scott Anfinson, SHPO National Register KEY Project Location Fort Snellin g National Historic Landmark (NHL) Fort Snellin g Historic District (NRHP-listed ) Old Fort Snelling Historic District (State Snellin g Archaeolo gical District (21HE0099 ) River and Recreation (MNRRA ) Fort Snelling State Historical Park Taku Wakan Ti (Ollendorf and Anderson 2004 ) Project Location Coldwater Sprin g Saint Paul West Quadrangle, Minnesota (1993) (USGS 7.5 Minute Series)United States Bureau of Mines - T CRC Boundaries of Previousl y Identified Historical and Cultural Resources in the Vicinit y of the TCRC Propert y Ethnographic Resources Stud y Fi gure 11 Hennepin County, Minnesota N 0 miles 0.5Coldwater Sprin g and Reservoir 55 Corridor Current TH 55 Corridor Former TH 55 Corridor Site 21HE 030919th-c.

The ar eas of significance for the property are identified as historic: commerce, communications, military, political, and transportation. The nomination National Register nomination form calls out Coldwater Spring: \"Because of its proximity to a spring, which served as a water source for many years, it was named Camp Cold Water . This was the headquarters for th e troops during the construction of the fort\" (Grossman 1969). In 1999, the Keep er of the National Re gister of Historic Places submitted to the Minnesota SHPO a ma p of the Fort Snelling National Register Historic District boundaries as they believed the property to be listed (see Figure 11) (Carol D. Schull, Keeper of the National Regi ster of Historic Places, to Britta Bloomberg, Deputy State Historic Preser vation Officer, letter, May 7, 1999). The Fort Snelling Historic District, as recognized by the Nati onal Register, is an irregularly bounded area encompassing approximately 640 acres. The boundaries of the district are more expansive than those of the NHL and include not only the historic fo rt buildings, but the site of Cantonment New Hope, and other la nds and structures associated with the 150- year influence of the fort in the region. The boundary of the district within the TCRC property is not clearly defined in the verbal description of the district, but is indicated on the map accompanying the letter from the Keeper of the National Register as an arch that follows a former railroad spur through the project area. This boundary excludes the Coldwater Spring and reservoir (see Figure 12). In their TH 55 cultu ral resources study, Hotopp et al. (1999:54) state th at the spring is considered a contributing element to the Fort Snelling Historic District under Nati onal Register Criterion A and, potentially, Criterion D. In its review of the completed TH 55 cultural resource assessment, the Minnesota SHPO also identified Coldwater Sp ring as \"a contributing feature to the Fort Snelling Historic District\" (Bloomberg 1999:1). Fort Snelling Archaeological District The Fort Snelling Archaeological District (21HE099) is identi fied within the SHPO files as being listed on the National Register. As the site is not separately listed, it must, therefore, be associated with either the Fort Snelling National Register Historic District, or the Fort Snelling NHL. Examination of the SHPO site maps indicates that the site has been defined as having the same boundaries as the NHL. A site form from April of 1996, though, defined the boundaries of the site as be ing those of the state's Old Fort Snelling Historic District with th e exception of that portion lo cated within Dakota County (Minnesota Archaeological Site Form, 21HE099, on f ile at the SHPO). While the above boundaries only include portions of the T CRC property, site forms completed for archaeological work performed by Braun Intert ec within the TCRC property in August of 1996 were filed as updates to 21HE099. In light of these forms, the boundary for site 21HE099 was adjusted on the SHPO site ma p to encompass the TCRC property, as well as the location of 21HE309. Due to this lack of consensus on the boundaries of 21HE099, for the purposes of this report, the Fort Snelling Archaeological District is defined as being the boundary of the state's Old Fort Snelling Histor ic District (which encompasses the boundary of the NHL) with the addition of the updated boundary that encompasses the 1996 findings and the location of site 21HE309 (see Figure 11). All of the TCRC property is contai ned within this site. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 86 State of Minnesota Historic Designations Fort Snelling State Historical Park/Fort Snelling State Park The earliest state-level histor ic designation for Fort Snelling was the establishment in 1961 of the Fort Snelling State Historical Park (Minnesota Session Laws 1961, Chapter 570). This property included all of the Ft. Snelling Military Reservation that had not been previously granted to other agencies or sold (Scott Anfinson, SHPO National Register Archaeologist, to Dennis Gimmestad, SHPO Government Programs and Compliance Officer, memorandum , February 2, 1998). The bounda ries of this property are not known, but subse quent legislation identifies the pr operty as being limited to state lands (Minnesota Session Laws 1965, Chapter 779, Section 4). Acco rding to the current Minnesota Statutes, Fort Snelli ng State Historical Park and Fort Snelling State Park are one and the same and encompass portions of Hennepin, Ramsey, and Dakota Counties (Minnesota Statutes 2005, Chap ter 85.012, Subd. 18). The boundari es of this park adjoin the south and east boundaries of the TCRC (see Figures 11 and 12). State Historic Sites Regist ry/Minnesota State Regist er of Historic Places In 1963, under Article II, Section 4, Subdivisi on 4, of the Omnibus Natural Resources and Recreation Act, the Minnesota Ou tdoor Recreation Resources Commission (MORRC) was charged to cooperate with the MHS in the \"establishment and maintenance of historic sites.\" In th e following year, the MORRC produced a report titled An Historic Sites Program for Minnesota , which identified 79 historical sites in Minnesota of \"state-wide or national significance\" (MORRC 1964). \"Old Fort Snelling\" was identified by this report as being \"significant as the cradle of settlement in the Northwest and the first military post in Minnesota\" (MORRC 1964:16-17). Cantonment New Hope and Camp Coldwater were associat ed with this listi ng, but no boundaries for \"Old Fort Snelling\" were identified (MORRC 1964:94). This list of sites formed the basis for the State Historic Sites Registry that was codified in 1965 under the Minnesota Historic Sites Act (Minnesota Session Laws 1965, Chapter 779). Both \"Fort Snelling\" and \"Camp Coldwater\" were li sted on the initial State Hist oric Sites Registry in 1965 (Minnesota Session Laws 1965, Chapter 779, Section 7). No boundaries for these properties were provided, but both were described as be ing \"within the authorized boundaries of Fort Snelling State Park\" (M innesota Session Laws 1965, Chapter 779, Section 7). This description places both of these state historic sites outsid e the boundary of the TCRC property. In 1973, the Bureau of Mines tr ansferred 21 acres identified as Camp Coldwater to the State of Minnesota to be administered by the MHS as part of the Fort Snelling Historic site (Minnesota Session Laws 1973, Chapter 225 , Section 1). An exact legal description of this parcel is included in the session laws. This parcel is located to the immediate east of the current TCRC property and does not overlap with the current proj ect area. Also, in 1973, the abandoned railroad right of way that forms the western boundary of the Camp Coldwater parcel and the eas t boundary of the TCRC proper ty was also added to the historic site and was permitted for developm ent as a trail (Minnesota Session Laws 1973, Chapter 225, Section 2. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 87 In 1993, the Minnesota Historic Sites Act was recodified and those sites administered by the MHS were listed on the Historic Sites Network, while non-MHS sites were listed on the Minnesota State Register of Historic Places (Laws of Minnesota for 1993, Chapter 181). At this time \"Camp Coldwater\" was placed on the State Historic Sites Network and it is currently listed there (Minnesota St atutes 2005, 138.662, Subd. 6). Properties on the State Historic Sites Network ar e \"significant state resources that the Minnesota Historical Society is preserving, developi ng, interpreting, and maintaining for public use, benefit, and access during open hours\" (Minnesota Statutes 2005, Chapter 138.661, Subd. 1). Therefore, Camp Coldwater, as listed on the St ate Register of Historic Places is located beyond the boundaries of the TCRC property. Old Fort Snelling Historic District \"Old Fort Snelling\" is not only listed on the St ate Register of Historic Places, but in 1971, the \"Old Fort Snelling Historic District\" was added to the State Hist oric Sites Registry pursuant to the Minnesota Histor ic District Act of that ye ar (Minnesota Session Laws 1971, Chapter 709, Section 3; Minnesota Statutes 2005, Chapter 138.664, Subd. 73 and Chapter 138.73, Subd. 13). The Old Fort Snelling Historic District in cludes the locations of Old Fort Snelling; Taylor Avenue; Cantonment New Hope; and Camp Coldwater and is recognized as being associated with the themes of Military Affairs; Exploration; Architecture; Political Affairs; Transportation 1975:31). The boundari es of the Old Fort Snelling Historic District are provided in Minnesota Stat utes 2005, Chapter 138.73, Subd. 13 (see Figure 11). In the vicinity of the TCRC property, the boundary of this district is defined by the now-abandoned right-of-way of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad spur (this is a different railroad spur than that which defines the boundary of the National Register historic distri ct). This former railroad grade marks the eastern boundary of the TCRC property, and, therefore, the Old Fo rt Snelling Historic District does not encompass any portion of the TCRC property. Mississippi National River an d Recreation Area (MNRRA) In 1988, the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area (MN RRA) was established by Congress as a unit of the na tional park system. The park encompasses approximately 54,000 acres of public and private land along 72 miles of the Mississippi River and four miles of the Minnesota River. Of the acr eage contained within the park's boundaries, only 35 are owned by the National Park Se rvice. Among the basic concepts for managing this portion of the river corridor is the statement that \"n atural areas will be preserved, appropriate treatment of cultural resources will be ensured, economic resources will be protected, and public use will be enhanced\" (National Park Service 1995). The TCRC property is located entire ly within the MNRRA corridor (see Figures 11 and 12). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 88 PREVIOUS CULTURAL RESOURCE STUDIES WITHIN THE TCRC PROPERTY Braun Intertec Corporation: Archaeologi cal and Architectural History Studies The U.S. Bureau of Mines, TCRC was closed by the federal government in 1995. As part of the closure process, an archaeological and historic al study of the property was undertaken by Braun Intertec Co rporation and US West Rese arch (Ollendorf and Godfrey 1996). This study consisted of a Phase I arch aeological study and the evaluation of the structures on the property. As a result of this study the TCRC buildings were found to be eligible for listing in the National Register as \"a significant national and regional element in the history of science and technology of mineral produc tion and mining in the time period 1949 to 1996\" (Ollendorf a nd Godfrey 1996:IB-3). The bu ildings form an historic district consisting of 13 contributing properties and two non-contributing properties (Henning 2002:3). The boundary of this proposed district encompasses the current TCRC property. Braun Intertec also conducted Phase I archaeolo gical investigations consisting of shovel tests and auger holes at 10 lo cations within the TCRC proper ty, including tests within the vicinity of the Coldwater Spring reservoi r (Area H) (Ollendorf and Godfrey 1996). One area along the eastern edge of the property (Area J) was also selected for Phase II evaluation including the excavation of a singl e test unit (Ollendorf 1996). While modern artifacts were encountered across much of the si te, no early historic or pre-contact artifact deposits were documented. Based on these re sults, the areas tested were recommended as not contributing to the Fort Snelling Hist oric District and no further archaeological work was recommended. National Park Service Sponsored Studies In the year 2000, a Memorandum of Agre ement (MOA) was drafted between the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation; the Bureau of Mines/Office of the Secretary of the Interior; and the SHPO to address historic resource pr eservation and planning issues associated with the closure of the property in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. The draft MOA called for the evaluation of the area of the spring and rese rvoir to determine if the boundaries of the Fort Snelling National Register District and the Fort Snelling NHL should be adjusted to include the spring, and whether it meets the Na tional Register criteria as an individually significant historic property. This evaluation, as described, was to address three aspects of the property, including if the spring and reservoir were significant as: \"(1) an archaeological property linked to the developm ent of Fort Snelling after 1820; (2) as an historic site significant for its association with Fort Snelling betw een the years 1880 and 1946; and (3) as a Native American Traditiona l Cultural Property\" (A dvisory Council on Historic Preservation n.d.:3). While the MOA was never finalized or signed, the NPS oversaw the completion of the first two studies: an arch aeological study by Robert A. Clouse of the Minnesota Historic al Society (2001) and a histor ical study of the property by Barbara J. Henning of Riverc rest Associates (2002). (The current study addresses the third aspect of the evaluation). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 89 Minnesota Historical Society: Archaeological Research In 2000 and 2001, the MHS, in conjunction with the NPS, completed an archaeological study of the TCRC property (C louse 2001). While Braun In tertec had previously conducted archaeological investigations on the property, the methods employed were not sufficient to adequately evaluate the potential for intact cultural deposits to survive beneath more recent fill events and landscapi ng. Through the excava tion of 30 test units within the site, Clouse identified portions of the site containing intact soils as well as material culture relating to the period of significance for the Fort Snelling NHL and National Register District (Cl ouse 2001:65, 91). This area of intact material culture was located within the west half of the TCRC pr operty and includes the Coldwater Spring and reservoir. A bone comb and an Englis h style gunflint were among the early 19 th century materials recovered (both of these objects we re discovered within a unit located along the west edge of the property) (Clouse 2001:79-80). During th ese archaeological investigations, no American Indian artifacts were encountered, although Clouse noted that the area would have lik ely been used by American Indians. Clouse recommended that further testing be conducte d in areas of intact natural soils, a nd that the area that yielded intact archaeological deposits from th e period of significance for Fort Snelling be included within the boundaries of the Fort Snelling NHL and Nationa l Register District (Clouse 2001:iv-v ) (Figure 13). Rivercrest Associates: Historical Study In 2002, Barbara Henning of Rivercrest Associ ates completed a historical study of the TCRC property. The primary objectives of this study were to: (1) id entify any resources that may be individually eligible for listing on the National Register or that contribute to the significance of the existing historic dist rict and NHL; and (2) to provide information that could be used to interpret the TCRC property in the future (Henning 2002:1). Because much had already been written on th e early history of the project area, and the Ollendorf and Godfrey (1996) study had cove red the period from 1946 through 1993, the Rivercrest Associates report focused on th e history of the property from 1838 through 1946 (Henning 2002:1). In particular, research focused on the key phases of government and non-government use of the property, as we ll as historical evidence for American Indian associations with the study area (He nning 2002:1-2).

Baker; the St. Louis Hotel; the George W. Lincoln farmstead; the Fort Snelling waterworks system; and Coldwater Park. In their examination of archival evidence fo r American Indian associations, Rivercrest Associates concluded that \"Camp Coldwate r was the place where some Indians camped temporarily when they visited the Baker Tr ading house, Fort Snel ling, and the Indian Agency\" primarily during the 1820s-1840s, but that they found \"no evidence that the area and the spring have had specific Native American names nor have they been tied to specific spirits or spiritual practices historically\" (He nning 2002:26). Based on the results of their study, Rivercrest Associates recommended that the boundaries of the Fort Snelling NHL and National Register District be adjusted to the west in order to encompass the Coldwater Spring and reservoir th at have been associated with important events and uses within the period of significance for the NHL and National Register District (Henning 2002:37) (see Figure 13). PREVIOUS CULTURAL RESOURCE STUDIES NEAR THE TCRC PROPERTY TH 55 Archaeological Research In addition to archaeological fieldwork with in the TCRC property, archaeological studies have also taken place within the immediate vi cinity of the project area. Many of these previous investigations have been associated with the TH 55 corridor that is located to the south and west of the propert y (see Figure 12). During th e late 1960s a nd early 1980s, the Minnesota Trunk Highway Archaeological program examined portions of this corridor, but no archaeologica l sites were reported (Fra nke 1970; Peterson and Yourd 1983). In 1998, BRW, Inc. completed a Phase I archaeological survey in preparation for the upgrading and rerouting of TH 55 between South 46th Street and County Road 62 (Halverson et al. 1999). Archaeological test ing of seven discrete segments along the proposed project corridor resu lted in the identification of one previously undocumented historic period site (21HE291) associated with the Longfellow Gardens (1907-1936). No pre-contact or contact period resources were identified during this survey. In 1999, Louis Berger & Associates, Inc. completed an additional cultural resource assessment of the TH 55 segment from 54 th Street to County Road 62 (Hotopp et al. 1999). This study included an assessment of the potential for the project area to contain archaeological resources, human burials, and TCPs. The study concluded that no human remains existed within the proposed right-of-way, but recommended arch aeological monitoring during the early stages of road construction (Hotopp et al. 1999:61). With regard to TCPs, the investigation concluded that the four bur oa k trees located within the proposed TH 55 corridor lacked \"historic significance and should not be considered eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places as a Traditional Cultural Property\" (Hotopp et al. 1999:59). A preliminary evaluation of Coldwater Spring, though, resulted in the recommendation that \"the potential for traditio nal cultural value is sufficient to warrant further investigation of the spring's eligibility as a Traditional Cultural Property\" (Hotopp et al. 1999:60). U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 92 During archaeological monitori ng for TH 55, Louis Berger & Associates, Inc. conducted a Phase I and Phase II archaeological investiga tion of a wooded upland to the east of the proposed T.H. 55 alignment and to the imme diate west of the TCRC property (Schoen 2002:ii). Testing at this location, which wa s 125 meters south of the TCRC entrance road, resulted in the identification of an artifact scatter from the period of the Camp Coldwater settlement (1821-1840)(Schoen 2002:ii)(Site 21HE0309 on Figure 12). While site 21HE309 was evaluated as lacking integrity due to more recent disturbances, the site produced numerous artifacts from the Camp Coldwater period including pearlware (1775-1840) and creamware (1762-1820) sherds; a brass crucifix probably to the eighteenth century and of Fren ch origin; a pre-1820 brass se rpentine sideplate from a pistol or fowling piece; and tobacco pipe fragments with decoration dating from 1825-1875 (Schoen 2002:92-93, 97). The presence of household and personal items, as well as architectural materials (nails, a door lock, and window glass) le d to the association of this artifact scatter with the lo cation of a former Camp Cold water dwelling. Based on the distance and direction of the structure from Coldwater Spring, the site was tentatively identified as being associated with either th e Pepin or Le Rage st ructures identified on Smith's 1837 map (Schoen 2002:99)(see Figure 3) . During the monitoring, a nineteenth century (1830-1860) artif act scatter of undetermined origin was also identified to the north of the TCRC property (Schoe n 2002:100-101) (see Figure 12). Ollendorf and Anderson: Taku Wakan Tipi Study In November of 2004, Peterson Environmenta l Consulting, Inc. complete a TCP and National Register of Historic Places eligibility assessment for Taku Wakan Tipi (Dwelling Place of the Wakan), or Morgan 's Mound (Ollendorf and Anderson 2004). Taku Wakan Tipi is a hill located to the immediate we st of the TCRC property in the area of the Veteran Administration Hospital (Oll endorf and Anderson 2004) (see Figure 11). This hill is regarded as the dwelling place of the Unktehi (Pond 1889:220; Durand 1994:86), and its cultu ral importance is \"strongly related to its proximity to Mdote \" (Ollendorf and Anderson 2004:12). The Unktehi is said to use a tunnel to access the Minnesota River from the hill (Eastm an 1995:156; Durand 1994: 86). Ollendorf and Anderson's study combined information from archival research an d interviews with Dakota elders. The report concluded that Taku Wakan Tipi met National Register Criterion A for its association with Mdote and the Dakota Creation, and Criterion B for its association with the Unktehi - particularly as it is the only place name that directly references this \"most significant sacred be ing\" (Ollendorf and Anderson 2004:25). But, while \"Taku Wakan Tipi 's position within the Dakota belief system is indisputable,\" the physical integrity of the site was regard ed as poor and having lost its collective association, feeling, and sett ing (Ollendorf and Anderson 200 4:27). The study concludes, though, that Taku Wakan Tipi should be considered one element within a discontiguous TCP historic district centered on Mdote (Ollendorf and Anderson 2004:28). RECOMMENDED BOUNDARY CHANGES During the TH 55 cultural resour ce investigations, it was stated that the Coldwater Spring is considered a contributing element to the Fort Snelling Historic District under National U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 93 Register Criterion A and, poten tially, Criterion D (Hotopp et al . 1999:54). In its review of the completed TH 55 cultural resource assessment, the Minnesota SHPO also identified Coldwater Spring as \"a contributin g feature to the Fort Snelling Historic District\" (Bloomberg 1999:1). Furthermore, le tters to interested me mbers of the public from the desk of Scott Anfinson, SHPO arch aeologist, included the statement that the SHPO had \"determined this reservoir [near the Camp Coldwater marker] and the land immediately adjacent to it to be eligible for the National Register as a cultural landscape\" (S. Anfinson to R. Mosedale, letter, Ma y 5, 1998, Personal Files of David Fudally provided by the NPS). The Coldwater Spring, though, is outside of the current boundaries of the Fort Snelling NHL and Nationa l Register District (see Figures 11 and 12). Only a portion of the Coldwater Spring reservoir is within the Fort Snelling NHL boundary (see Figure 12). In light of these boundaries, the NPS has aske d its consultants to assess if the boundaries of these resources should be adjusted to include the spring. Both the Clouse (2001) and Henning (2002) studies made r ecommendations for the altera tion of the boundaries of the Fort Snelling NHL and National Register Distri ct (see Figure 13). Ba sed on the results of this study, the research team concurs that the boundaries of these designations should be adjusted to encompass the Coldwater Spring and its environs. Based on conversations with Dakota and Ojibwe community members, there is a consensus that the boundaries of Coldwater Spring include not only where the water flows from the rock wall, but also the source of the spring and the location where the spring water finally deposits into the Mississippi River. Adjusti ng the boundaries, as recomm ended by Clouse (2001:91) and Henning (2002:37), would encompass the point where the spring emits from the rock, as well as the route of the spring to the river. Both of these authors recommended extending the boundary to the western edge of the curren t TCRC property. As intact archaeological resources associated with Camp Coldwater, though, have been found immediately adjacent to the western boundary of the property, as well as to the west of the property's fence (21HE309), the research team recomm ends extending the boundary of the property to the current ditching of the west bound TH 55 to Hiawatha roadway (see Figure 13). The final boundary determination for the s ource of Coldwater spri ng, though, should be made in consultation with the Dakota communities. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 94 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS INTRODUCTION During 2005, Summit Envirosolutions, In c. and Two Pines Resource Group, LLC, completed an ethnographic res ources study of the former U. S. Bureau of Mines, Twin Cities Research Center (TCRC) property in Hennepin County, Minnesota, for the National Park Service (NPS). The primary objective of this study was to identify relationships of Dakota and Ojibwe people with the natural and cultural resources located within the boundaries of the 27.32-acre TCRC property, and to explore and document such affiliations be they precontact, historic al, or contemporary. Particular emphasis was placed on the identification and documentati on of any natural or cultural ethnographic resources present on the property that are c onsidered traditionally meaningful by Dakota or Ojibwe people. Identified ethnographic resources were eval uated within the context of Dakota and Ojibwe history and contemporary cultural use for their eligibility for listing in the National Register as TCPs and to determine their status as Sacred Sites. Results will be incorporated into an EIS that will consider disposition alternatives and the potential impacts of alternative future uses of the TCRC property on th e natural, historic, and cultural resources within the property's boundaries. The significance of historic Camp Coldwate r has already been r ecognized through its inclusion on the National Register within the Fort Snelling Historic District and its association with the Fort Snelling National Historic Landmark, although the spring itself is only partially within the boundaries of th ese resources. Prior to the current study, historical and archaeological evaluations of the TCRC property were completed. Missing from these previous historic designations and the previous studies were the Dakota and Ojibwe perspectives on Coldwater Spring and any other natural and cultural resources located within the TCRC property. The curr ent ethnographic study therefore focused on identifying Dakota and Ojibwe connections to this place through tribal consultation, archival research, and interviews. Official responses to consultation were received from all four of the federally-recognized Dakot a communities in Minnesota (Lower Sioux Indian Community, Prairie Island Indian Community, Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Community, Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, and the Upper Sioux Indian Community), and one Minnesota Ojibwe (White Earth Band of Chippewa) community. Twenty three individuals were interviewed for this st udy including 11 official federally recognized tribal representatives (incl uding at least one individual re presenting each of the above- mentioned communities), 7 key cultural experts (6 Dakota and 1 Ojibwe), and 5 other informants with knowledge of the history and past use of the TCRC property. Coldwater Spring was evaluated in terms of its status as an Ethnographic Resource, a TCP, and a Sacred Site. The results of th is evaluation are discu ssed at length in the previous text of the report a nd are summarized briefly below. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 95 COLDWATER SPRING : ETHNOGRAPHIC RESOURCE IDENTIFICATION Coldwater Spring is defined as an ethnogr aphically significant natural resource by virtue of its association with important tr aditions and the groups that practice them . During the course of this study, Coldwate r Spring was identified by Dakota and Ojibwe people as a natural resource that has traditional meaning for them. For the Dakota, this resource is meaningful to their identity b ecause of its association with the culturally significant Mdote area at the confluence of the Minneso ta and Mississippi rivers, and its association with the deity Unktehi . The spring is perceived by them as contributing to the survival of their lifeways b ecause natural springs like Cold water are necessary to the observance of traditionally m eaningful ceremonies that require natural spring water for their performance. Likewise, the Ojibwe people that we interviewed perceived that the spring contributed to th e survival of their traditions and ceremonies, particularly the activities of the Mdewiwin lodge, that require natural spring water. These testimonies have led to the identific ation of Coldwater Sp ring as an ethnographic natural resource. The traditi onal groups associated with th is resource are the Dakota and Ojibwe communities. Because the traditions held by the Dakota and Ojibwe that use natural spring water, such as the Inipi, are integral to their development and continued existence as an ethnically distinct people, and because they have been practicing these traditions for at least two or more generations, Coldwater Spring is defined as an ethnographically significant natural resource by virtue of its association with these traditions and the groups that practice them using the water from the spring. COLDWATER SPRING : TRADITIONAL CULTURAL PROPERTY EVALUATION Results of this study ensure that Coldwater Spring is a property, and in particular, it is identified as a site (a natural spring) that is culturally significant for its association with : \u0083 the Mdote area at the confluence of the Minneso ta and Mississippi rivers, which is regarded as the center of all things and historically significant by the Mdewakanton Dakota; \u0083 the Dakota tradition of the Unktehi ; and \u0083 the activity of collecting spri ng water for ceremonial use. Results of this study show that Coldwater Spring retains integrity of relationship and condition. By virtue of being a natural spring th at was part of the historical Dakota landscape, Coldwater Spring is regarded by the Dakota interviewed as a significant water source that is important to the performance of their hist orically rooted practices. Coldwater Spring is currently being used by Dakota tribal members as a source of natural spring water for use in traditional practices, such as the Inipi. Furthermore, the spring is regarded as important to the retention and c ontinued performance of traditional practices requiring natural spring water, particularly for Dakota people who reside in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. One interviewee stated , \"This place is so intrinsic to a way of U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 96 life that not only does it deserv e preservation and restoration, but it is much deeper than that...it is necessary to the survival of th e people. Spiritual su rvival rests on the restoration of these places\" (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Co mmunity, October 25, 2005). As such, Coldwater Spring is integral to the performance of historically rooted cultural practices that have been identified as important in maintaining the continuing cultural identity of both Dakota people. During the interviews for this study, the interviewees were questioned about the conditional transformations that have ta ken place on the property and whether they impact the integrity of the spring. The genera l consensus is that si nce the water of the spring still flows from the ground, the integrity of location and association, and hence the integrity of the spring as a traditional property, ha s not been impacted despite changes to the spring's setting. In keeping with Bulletin 3 8, if the integrity has not been lost in the eyes of the associated community, it likely retains sufficient integrity to justify further evaluation (Parker and King 1998:10). Results of this study show that Coldwater Spring is eligible for the National Register under Criteria A and C-4, but not criteria B, or D. Criterion A: During the course of this study, interviewees identifie d the TCRC property and Coldwater Spring as pa rt of the landscape of Mdote - a historically and culturally significant location surrounding the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers. Mdote is considered by the Mdewakanton Dakota to be the middle of all things and the exact center of the earth or Makoce Cokaya Kin , and, in one belief, is associated with the event of the Dakota creatio n (Cavender 1988:13). While the TCRC property, and, therefore, Coldwater Spring is associated with Mdote , Coldwater Spring is also directly linked with the event of the Mdote creation by an oral history. Therefore, Coldwater Spring is recommended as eligible for the National Register unde r Criterion A when evaluated as a TCP for its association with Mdote . Criterion B: As properties list ed on the National Register und er Criterion B are generally restricted to those that can be directly li nked to the person and the person's significant achievements, Coldwater Spring is not recommended as eligible for listing in the National Register under Cr iterion B, because the Unktehi 's association with this spring is no more significant than his associ ation with any other spring. Criterion C: Coldwater Spring is not recommen ded as eligible for the National Register under subcriterion C-1, C-2, or C-3. Subcriterion 4 of Criter ion C (representative of a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may l ack individual distinction), however, is applicable to Coldwater Spring. Coldwater Spring is a natural spring that is indistinguishable to the casual observer from any other natu ral spring. Coldwater Spring, though, is imbued with cultural importance, because of its association with the Mdote area. Furthermore, springs figure significan tly in the practice of Dakota traditional ceremonies, in particular the Inip i, that require pure water for their performance. While Coldwater Spring may lack distinction as an individual spring, it is representative of the U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 97 type of natural springs (ma ny of which have been dest royed or which are no longer accessible) that are significant for their role in Dakota traditional lifeways. Hence, Coldwater Spring and springs like it are inte gral to the continued observance of these rituals. Coldwater Spring is therefore recommended as eligible for the National Register under Criterion C-4. Criterion D: In the case of Coldwater Spring, the property, as a natu ral feature, does not have the potential to yield important inform ation in prehistory or history. Coldwater Spring is therefore not recommended as eligib le for the National Register under Criterion D. Results of this study show that there are no National Register criterion considerations that make the property ineligible. Coldwater Spring is exempt from all of the following considerations and they require no fu rther discussion: Consideration B: Relocated properties Consideration C: Birthplaces and graves Consideration D: Cemeteries Consideration E: Reconstruction Consideration F: Commemoration Consideration A: While the TCRC property is not owned by a religious institution, the Coldwater Spring is used as a source of pure water for carrying out ceremonies. These activities, though, are expressions of traditional cu ltural beliefs that are historically rooted and cannot be divorced from the continued pu rsuit of the traditi onal lifeways of Dakota and Ojibwe people. Hence, while these activ ities may be considered \"religious,\" this does not make the practice of collecting wa ter from the spring any less historically rooted, or culturally significant, and, theref ore, does not make the property ineligible under Consideration A for listing in the National Register. Consideration G: In the case of Coldwate r Spring, the associated significance has been identified as that of a natural spring water source for the practice of Dakota and Ojibwe traditional ceremonies that require pure water for their performance. The historically rooted observance of these practices, including the use of springs a nd the performance of the Inipi, can be documented through accepted m eans of research and have been demonstrated in this report to be 50 years or older; therefore, while no oral traditions or historical accounts were shared or discove red during this study th at document onsite cultural practices at Coldwater Spring that ar e 50 years or older, the practice or tradition associated with the spring's current use can be documented to be older than 50 years. It is also asserted by Dakota elders that Coldwa ter Spring is the type of spring that would have been used in prehistory as a source of water for ceremonies by the Dakota occupants of the Mdote area, including the occupants of Ti Tanka Tanina , the \"old village,\" and it is currently being used by members of fe derally recognized Dakota and Ojibwe communities, and other Dakota and Ojibwe individuals, as a source of water for U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 98 historically rooted ce remonies. Coldwater Spring is, ther efore, considered exempt from Consideration G. COLDWATER SPRING : SACRED SITE DETERMINATION It has been communicated to the authors of this study by members of federally recognized tribes that Coldwater Spring is a Sacred Site. The declaration of a \"sacred site,\" requires an official request from a federally recognized tribe or an official declaration by the recognized religious leader of a federally recognized tribe with specific evidence about its sacred character and histor y. The authors of this report can therefore only convey that Coldwater Spring has been identified during interviews as a \"sacred site.\" Official designation of the spring as such must originate within federally recognized tribal communities. MDOTE CULTURAL DISTRICT Results of this study support the rec ognition of a Mdote Cultural District. During the course of this study, Dakota interviewees repeatedly emphasized the importance of considering the relationshi p of the TCRC property to the larger Mdote (Minnesota and Mississippi river confluence) area and st ressed that Coldwater Spring could not be divorced from this larger contex t. For the Mdewakanton Dakota, the center of the earth, or Makoce Cokaya Kin , is located at Mdote , and in one belief it is also the point of their creation. Th e cultural importance of the Mdote area is reflected in the number of known and named Dakota cultural properties that are located within the vicinity of the confluence ( Oheyawahe; Taku Wakan Concentrated around Mdote are Dakota sacred landmarks, ceremonial gathering spots, habitation sites, and burials (Terre ll 2003a:81-82). Important events in Dakota history also took place within the area surrounding the confluence, including treaty signings and the establishment of a Dakota in ternment camp below Fort Snelling after the U.S.-Dakota Conflict. Several of these loca tions are identified on a map created by the Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Community (2003). In a 2003 study of Oheyawahe or Pilot Knob, Terrell recommended that this ar ea be considered pote ntially eligible for listing in the National Register as the Mdote Traditional Cultural District and cited other examples of TCP districts that are similar in scope and contain both natural features and activity areas (Terrell 2003a:82). Likewise, in their 2004 study of Taku Wakan Tipi , which is located to the west of the c onfluence, Ollendorf and Anderson (2004:27-28) acknowledge that \" Taku Wakan Tipi is linked to other Dakota spiritual places by geographic proximity and the traditional Dakot a belief system\" and suggest that \"this linkage may indicate that Taku Wakan Tipi should be viewed as just one element in a discontiguous TCP historic di strict.\" Based on the result s of the current study, and in keeping with the recommendations of the afor ementioned previous studies, the authors recommend that Coldwater Spring, together with other traditional sites in the area be considered contributing properties to a larger Mdot e Cultural District. The evaluation of this potential district is outside the scope of this work, and should be done in consultation with Dakota communities. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 99 NOMINATIONS It is recommended that the current National Register Nomination for the Fort Snelling National Register Historic District and the Fort Snelling National Historic Landmark be expanded to include the Coldwater Spring TC P, which, as a result of this study, was identified as eligible to the National Register under Criteria A and C. In addition, it is recommended that these documents be updated to include Dakota and Ojibwe themes and oral history associated with the prehisto ry and history of the Fort Snelling area. BOUNDARIES Concurrent with expanding the National Regi ster nominations as noted above, it is recommended that the National Register nom ination be re-written to include the boundaries of the Coldwater Springs TCP. As discussed in the text, it is recommended that the boundaries of the Fort Snelling NH L and the National Register District be adjusted to encompass Coldwater Spring and its vicinity. Based on conversations with Dakota and Ojibwe communities during this study, there is a consensus that the boundaries of Coldwater Spring include not only where the water flows from the rock wall, but also the source of the spring a nd the location where the spring water finally deposits into the Mississippi Ri ver. It is therefore recomm ended that the actual boundary determination be made in consultation w ith the Dakota and Ojibwe communities. MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS It is surrounded by capitalism, by democra cy, and 'freedom and justice for all.' Right? But where really is 'freedom and justice for all'? But we can all go to the spring and we can all sip from the sacred water, and that's a deeper meaning. - Eddie Benton-Banai, key cultural expert, August 30, 2005 Recommendations from the D akota and Ojibwe Communities Places such as Coldwater Spring have become scarce and, therefore, increasingly important as places to conduct trad itional ceremonies and practices. It is recommended that the future management of the property is such that the water quality and water flow of the spring remains undisturbed. \"The flow of the spring should not be stopped or disturbed. The underground stream from the spring to the Mississippi River must remain open to allow the gods to enter the river through the passageway\" (Cavender 1998). As regional surface and groundwater conditions may have an impact on the traditional integrity of the spring, it is recommended that bo th water quality and water flow be monitored on a continuous basis. Interviewees recommended that the property be cleaned up and given to/set aside for the Dakota and Ojibwe communities to use it for ceremonial purposes. Interviewees also emphasized the increasing importance of this site as other natural springs are lost to development and as other sacred sites are destroyed. Intervie wees stressed that Coldwater Spring is important to maintaining the cultural identity of Dakota, Ojibwe, and U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 100 other American Indians residing in the metropo litan area as they are removed from their own traditional sites. Interviewees explaine d that Coldwater Spring is a unique resource within the metropolitan area, and since the me tropolitan area does not have a public space for tribal gatherings, setting aside Coldwater Springs for tribal use would ensure the continuing cultural identity of urban Indians as well as others around the state. Furthermore, interviewees pointed out that returning the propert y to the Dakota and Ojibwe people would create an opportunity fo r repatriation of the land that the Dakota initially granted to the U.S. Government in 1805. \"3 of 4 Dakota groups came to a meeting and said 'give land back'\" (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, June 22, 2005) the federal government should clean up the contaminants \"Actually what I think the federal governme nt should just turn it back over to the tribes, because of that history. I also think they s hould be responsible for the cleanup, because we didn't leave it like that . We didn't sell it like that. We never got paid for it. So, you know, I think that's a big piece.\" (Dallas Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, June 21, 2005) \"Because that's actually at the center of all these peopl e that are liv ing around this area, or a piece of what they believed. A nd then turn it back into sacred ground. Allow the ceremonies to happen there ag ain.\" (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, June 21, 2005) \"How would I see it in the future? I'd see all those buildings down. I'd see the federal government taking some responsibil ity for the mess it created and clean it up.\" (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, June 21, 2005) \"Your question is what would you like to see? This is it. You know, give it back to the tribes. Take responsibility for th e mess they made and allow the tribes to re-establish it or -- not re-establish, that 's the wrong word. But bring it back to what it was used for in the first place, which would have been surrounding the ceremonies that would have surrounded t hose springs.\" (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, June 21, 2005) \"Return it to the tribes so th at it can be used as it was used before.\" (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, October 25, 2005) return to \"common ground\" where al l tribes can go, spiritual center \"And it should be a place -- it could be a place for ce remonies. We have a huge population of native people that have now here to go on the bus lines or anything else for their ceremonies. This could be a place that could be easily converted to that.\" (Jim Anderson, Mendota Mdewak anton Dakota Community, June 24, 2005) U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Page 101 a place where the Native American p opulation of the Twin Cities can go This above recommendation would necessita te consultation with Dakota and Ojibwe communities regarding access issues for non- native people. Some interviewees expressed concern regarding some of the non- native ceremonial activ ities happening at the spring and their continued presence. It is recommended that the property be restored and that the restoration be determined in consultation with Dakota and Ojibwe communities. It was said that the \"spiritual survival rests on the restoration of these places.\" (Tom Ross, Upper Sioux Indian Community, October 25, 2005). In addition to other concerns of the Dakota and Ojibwe communities, it is recommended that restora tion discussions include the future of the buildings, and the possibility of incorporating native prairie plantings. The presence of cultural plants is important to the Dakot a and Ojibwe people for maintaining their traditional culture (Joe Williams, key cultur al expert, November 5, 2005). This study shows that many culturally significant plants a ssociated with springs, including min\u00ed yuh\u00e1, are herbaceous, and may, in fact, grow on the property. Others would return in time with the care and attention of people w ho know about the plants and their care. CONCLUSION Summit Envirosolutions, Inc. and Tw o Pines Resource Group, LLC recommend continued consultation with Dakota and Ojibwe communities regarding the future of the TCRC property.

Terrell SELECTED PROJECT EXPERIENCE Determination of Eligibility of Carver's Cave (21RA27) and Dayton's Bluff Cave (21RA28), Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary Pr oject, St. Paul, Ramsey County, Minnesota . Michelle Terrell served as the Principal Inves tigator and historian for a study of the cultural resources present within the proposed Bruce Vent o Nature Sanctuary in St. Paul, Minnesota. This study commenced with the completion of a literature search using primary and secondary documents to identify historic resources and potential archaeological sites within the park. One of the previously identified cultural resources located within the park's boundary was a cave known to the Dakota as Wakan Tepee and to EuroAmericans as Carver's Cave. Michelle conducted a Na tional Register of Historic Places eligibility study of this cave and the neighboring Dayton's Bluff Cave with a particular emphasis on the potential for these caves to be traditional cultural properties. Research for this evaluation included oral interviews with Dakota elders and the examination of extensive primary and secondary resources including explorer's records, historical maps, general land office records, photographs, newspapers, records of early archaeological surveys, and comparative literature on caves and petroglyph sites. The synthesis of the data gathered from these varied resources resulted in the recommenda tion of Wakan Tipi/Carver's Cave as eligible to the National Register. Subsequent to this recommendation, Michelle participated in tribal consultation to gather tribal input on the future treatment of Wakan Tipi/Carver's Cave. This project was performed from 2001-2004 for the C ity of St. Paul, Division of Parks and Recreation, 300 City Hall Annex, 25 West Fourth Street, Saint Paul, MN 55102; Contact: Don Ganje, 651-266-6400. This project was conducted under a previous association with The 106 Group, Ltd. A Historical, Cultural and Archaeological Evaluation and Determination of Eligibility of Pilot Knob, Dakota County, Minnesota. Michelle Terrell was the Principal Investigator for this National-Register eligibility study of a geographic feature located in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. This evaluation involved extensive background research on the history of the landform, including archival research, oral interviews with Dakota elders, and a field assessment. This study resulted in the recommendation of Oheyawahe/Pilo t Knob as eligible for listing on the National Register as a traditional cultural property and as a geographic feature of historical and cultural significance. This project was completed in 2003 for Siegel, Brill, Greupner, Duffy & Foster, P.A., 1300 Washington Square, South, Minneapolis, MN 55401; Contact: Gerald Duffy, 612-339-7131. This project was conducted under a previous association with The 106 Group, Ltd. Michelle M. Terrell Phase II Archaeological Resources Investigation of Sites 21NL130 and 21NL131 Located at the St. Peter Regional Treatment Center, Oshawa Township, Nicollet County, Minnesota . In October of 2004, Two Pines Resource Group, LLC completed a Phase II archaeological resources evaluation of two sites, 21NL130 (St. Peter Terrace Site) and 21NL131 (Oshawa Site), located on the property of the St. Peter Regional Treatment Center. Dr. Michelle Terrell was the Principal Investigator for this project. S ite 21NL130, a Terminal Woodland occupation with Lake Benton style ceramics lacked the quantity and quality of artifacts that could further our understanding of the Woodland occupation of this ar ea or answer important research questions and, therefore, no additional archaeological work was recommended at this site. Site 21NL131 produced diagnostic materials consistent with an In itial Woodland period occupation associated with the Fox Lake phase (200 B.C. - A.D. 900). Ba sed on this identification, and the rarity of such sites, 21NL131 was recommended as significant as eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. Project completed in 2004 for the Minnesota Department of Administrati on, 309 Administration Building, 50 Sherburne Avenue, St. Pa ul, MN 55155; Contact: of 21D K72 (Freitag Ridge Site) for the Proposed Hastings Wastewater Treatment Plant, Hastings, Dakota County, Minnesota . Under a previous association, Dr. Michelle Terrell served as the Principal Investigator for a Phase II archaeological evaluation of a precontact site with Archaic and Woodland period components located in Dakota County, Minnesota. Fieldwork cons isted of the excavation of formal test units within the boundaries of this 2.5-acre site. Based on its significance and integrity, site 21DK72 was recommended as eligible for listing on the National Register. Project completed in 2002 for the Metropolitan Council, 230 East 5 th Street, St. Paul, MN 55101; Contact: Bryce Pickart, 651- 602-1000. This project was conducted under a pr evious association with The 106 Group, Ltd. Phase I and II Archaeological Investigations fo r the CSAH 26 Reconstruction Project from CSAH 12 to Madison Lake, Blue Earth County, Minnesota . Under a previous association, Dr. Michelle Terrell served as the Principal Inve stigator for a Phase I survey and subsequent Phase II evaluation of sites located in Blue Earth County, Minnesota. Two precontact sites (21BE273 and 21BE274) identified during the Phase I survey were evaluated through the excavation of formal test units. Neither of thes e sites produced features, diagnostic artifacts, or other elements that might serve to answer important research questions and, therefore, they were recommended as not eligible for listing on the Nati onal Register. This project was completed in 2003 for the Blue Earth County Highway Depart ment, 35 Map Drive, P.O. This project was conducted under a previous association with The 106 Group, Ltd.

The BOM propert y contains Coldwater Springs and is associated with Historic Camp Coldwater. The overall purpose of this study is to identify ethnographic resources that may be present on the property and to determine whether the property (or part of the property) is a Traditional Cultural Property (TCP) or Sacred Site. A key component of this study involves meeting with interested Federally-recognized American Indian co mmunities and other interested individuals and groups to discuss the BOM property and to obtain information and input about whether there are cultural or natural resources there that are consid ered to be traditionally meaningful. Interview Meetings The purpose of the interview meetings is to discuss the BOM property with representatives from Federally-recognized American Indian communities a nd other interested individuals or groups. Specifically, we would like to know if there are cu ltural or natural resources on the property that are traditionally meaningful to you or your cultural group. Information and input shared about such resources is very important to the outcome of this study, as well as the future land use and management of the property. Interview Questions The interview meeting will not involve a formal list of questions. Instead, the interview meeting will be a collaborative discussion about the property between the Ethnographic Team (Penny Rucks, Michelle Terrell and Mollie O'Brien) and the interested partic ipants. The Ethnographic Team has developed some informal questions to guide the meeting and to ensure consistent coverage of key topics during interviews and/or follow-up conversations. Th e questions will simply be on hand to refer to as appropriate. The order, specific wording, and level to which questions are asked will depend on the flow of the interview and the comfort and willingness for the intervie w consultants to share information. The following questions have been listed as they ma y be useful to you in your preparation for the meeting. This list is by no means comprehensive, but shows a few examples of topics that can be discussed during the interview meeting. History, Stories, and Personal Associations What do you know about this place in the history of y our family/community/people? Did they use this place? Are there (historical) events associat ed with this place? With Coldwate r Spring? Who was involved, what happened and where? Names/Place What name did they (story-teller, historian, parents/ grandparents) use when referring to this place? With Coldwater Spring? 2How big is this place we are talking about (boundaries)? What does the area of Mdote mean to you? Significance of Springs/Coldwater What do springs mean to your community - to you? Is Coldwater Spring an important place? If so, why this spring? Is there a beginning or end of a spring (boundaries)? Of Coldwater Spring? Contemporary Meaning/Use/Integrity Can you talk about what activiti es were/are done at springs? In what way does the spring infl uence your sense of who you are? Do you know other people who might know about springs/Coldwater Spring? In what way do you think Coldwater Spring has changed over time? Would you/your lifeways be impacted by how this place is eventually managed and used? Would this property be an important place regardless of the Spring? Documentation Appropriate recording methods will be determined on a tribal/individual basis depending on the comfort and confidentiality concerns of in terview participants. Recording methods may include Detailed Note Taking, Video & Audio, or Audio. Consent and Confidentiality Researchers will discuss the intent of the ethnographic resources study with the interviewees, and how the study and interviews will be conduc ted in a collaborative manner with opportunity to re view and amend interviewee input. Researchers will discuss with interviewees how their contributions will be incorporated into the overall resear ch, the potential benefits and risks of disclosing cultural significance, and how their own contributions will be stored and protected. Provisions for confidentiality of sensitive information shared by interviewees and the anonym ity of the interviewee will also be discussed. Interviews will be documented through the use of con sent forms that will include a statement regarding limitations on confidentiality. These forms will be submitted to the NPS with the final report. Review Process Periodically during the interview, the ethnographic team will repeat back what wa s heard to confirm that information was heard and recorded correctly. This will provide the interview consultants a chance to make clarifications when appropriate. Following the interview, the information that was shared by the individual will be summarized or transcribed (if a tape was made), and provided to the interviewee for their review. A follow-up phone call, and possibly an inte rview, will take place in order to ensure that the informant agrees that the informati on that was captured is accurate. At this time the ethnographic team will also confirm the level of confiden tiality that the interviewee desires.

However, Interview Consent/Permission Forms were only received back from a few interview particip ants as included in Appendix F. APPENDIX G PREVIOUS TRIBAL STATEMENTS APPENDIX H PLANTS WITHIN THE TCRC PROPERTY HAVING DAKOTA AND OJIB WE CULTURAL USES THE CULTURAL SIGNIF ICANCE OF PLANTS During the course of our interviews, we were repeatedly asked about the plants in the vicinity of the spring and on the TCRC pr operty. The Dakota value certain medicinal plants present only in the unique environmen t around natural springs, and state that the healing quality of the water and these plan ts are interconnected (Interviewee C; Interviewee G). On the basis of these inqu iries, we present the following discussion summarizing what has been documented in the ethnographic literatu re about Dakota and Ojibwe cultural uses ascribed to pl ants present on the TCRC property. Ancestral knowledge of native plants is an important factor in the history, cultural heritage, and the tradi tional practices of American Indian s, and the presence of cultural plants is an issue in the significance of the TCRC propert y to Dakota and Ojibwe people for maintaining their traditional culture. The ethnographic literatur e was reviewed for uses by the Dakota and Ojibwe (AKA Sioux an d Chippewa) of plants identified within the TCRC property to assess the potential for signi ficant cultural plants on this property. For the purpose of this analysis, a \"significa nt\" cultural plant is one that sustains contemporary cultural practices. With the exception of min\u00ed yuh\u00e1, \"holds water,\" (Silphium perfoliatum ) information on plant use is drawn from pub lished sources, compiled and s ynthesized by Moerman (1999) in Native American Ethnobotany (a list of the primary sources cited by Moerman is included at the end of this summary). Note that the plant list is based on a recent inventory completed during the EIS process, which focused on characterizing the plant communities within the TCRC property, but w ith less attention on individual herbaceous species. Of the seventeen (17) trees iden tified in the survey, all but five (5), including introduced species of pine, spruce and weeping willow, have cultural uses documented in Moerman for the Ojibwe or Chippewa, and the Dakot a or Sioux. Eight (8) are growing on the TCRC property. Of the thirteen (13) shrubs identified, nine (9) have documented uses. Three (3) are growing on the TCRC property. In the herbaceous (Forbs) category thirty- one (31) plants are listed (some to the genus level). Thirteen (13) forbs have documented uses, and seven (7) grow on the TCRC property. CONTEMPORARY USES Medicinal plants remain culturally signifi cant, and those associated with springs are considered particularly potent. People cont inue to collect plants for individual and ceremonial uses, but just as important is si mply seeing the plants growing \"where they belong.\" It is difficult to th ink about individual plants as \"resources,\" since the process of finding and tending growing plan ts is an integral part of traditional \"use.\" Certain plants that are collected may be revisited se veral times (some are left for years) before they are harvested. Many cultural plants are simply left on the land. U.S. Bureau of Mines Twin Cities Research Center Property Ethnographic Resources Study Many culturally significant plants associ ated with springs, including min\u00ed yuh\u00e1, are herbaceous, and may, in fact, grow on the property. Others would return in time with the care and attention of people who know about the plants and their care. SIGNIFICANCE An inventory to identify culturally significant plants was not completed during the course of this study, but statements by Dakota comm unity members indicate that the potential for culturally significant plants is sufficien t to raise this issue as a compelling site attribute, just as wildlife managers frequently rely on habitat rather than an actual count, to assess the significance of a place to animal populations. Participants are confident that culturally significant plants are present, or have the potential to be present, and that these plants could be nurtured and used by people knowledgeable of traditional practices. PLANT LIST Information is presented below on cultural uses documented for species identified on the TCRC property. The plants are presented in the order listed in the botanical survey and the numbers in brackets refer to a key of primary sources cited in Moerman (1999) and included at the end of this text.
