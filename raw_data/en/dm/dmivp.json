This guide provides a background on the comp rehensive breastfeeding support model, the basic flow of the model, as well as complete, scripted lesson plans for 5 prenatal grou p sessions. The Need for a New Model for Providing Breastfeeding Support The Oregon WIC Program has historically enjoyed hig h rates of breastfeeding amongst its participants. Over 90% of Oregon WIC mo thers initiate breastfeeding, a rate almost 30 percentage points h igher than the national average for WIC participants. In addition Oregon enjoys one of the smallest gaps in breastfeeding rates between WIC participants and th e general population. These high rates hold steady across racial/ethnic groups with 83.3% of Black Oregon WIC mothers initiating breastfeeding. In addition, the Maternity Practices in Infant Care (mPINC) survey ranked Oregon 7th highest out of 52 states and territories with the State excelling in the number of birthing facilities that allow mothers and infants to stay together (room-in) duri ng their stay. Yet by six months, less than half of Oregon WIC mot hers who initiated breastfeeding still do so. Data from Oregon's peer counseling study showed that 30% of infants were introduced to formula within th e first week of life. Introduction i W ACCESS OREGON'S MATERNITY CARE SURVEY SCORES AT WWW.CDC.GOV/BREASTFEEDING/ DATA/MPINC 2Telephone interviews with a statewide sample of Ore gon WIC mothers in 2010 confirmed these findings and re-emphasized the need to help mothers to find alternatives to infant formula for dealing with the issues common to new mothers and getting started with breastfeeding. A quick review of the Healthy People 2020 breastfee ding goals finds that Oregon WIC will need to increase the number of participant s who are partially breastfeeding at six-months by almost 20 percentage points and to reduce the number of infants receiving formula in the first tw o days by 5 percentage points. A closer look at the mPINC scores shows that Oregon 's #7 ranking is based on a \"C\" score of 74 out of 100, that 61% of Oregon birt hing facilities offered breastfeeding infants supplements of formula, gluco se water or water, and that only 31% of facilities offered discharge care for c ontinued breastfeeding support. Clearly while the breastfeeding situation in Oregon seems sunny at first glance, a deeper look finds a less glowing reality. To tackle these substantial challenges, Oregon WIC needs a bold new approach to providing b reastfeeding promotion and support. Breastfeeding Support for Duration and Exclusivity A quick review of the literature on provision of br eastfeeding support finds the bulk of studies focus on initiation or short term d uration. While every mother has the right to be fully informed about the benefi ts of breastfeeding and the risks of infant formula, education on benefits alone will not increase long-term exclusive breastfeeding. Rather, a mother's own ind ividual motivations combined with the dynamics within her family will more great ly influence the course of breastfeeding. Key findings from studies centered o n duration and exclusivity are summarized in the tables below. WHAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN DURATION : PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS Mother's Priorities and Mothering Self-Efficacy: Mixture of a woman's confidence in her mother ability and the placement of the baby in her life priorities. Faith in Natural Superiority of Breast milk: Trust in the natural processes of one's body or an inherent distrust of infant formul a. There is no significant relationship between very early discontinuation and breastfeeding problems The Fact is, you can't 'fact' someone into long term exclusive breastfeeding Knowledge about the benefits of breastfeeding helped initiation but not duration 3 Adaptability and Flexibility : Transition to motherhood is a period of rapid change. Greater flexibility and adaptability of the mother leads to longer breastfeeding Stress Recognition and Management: Breastfeeding mothers seem to recognize stress as a threat and develop ways to combat it. F ormula feeding moms see breastfeeding as another stressor. O'Brien et al. Exploring the Influence of Psycholog ical Factors on Breastfeeding Duration: Phase 1, Pe Mothers and Clinicians. J Hum Lact 25(1) 55-83. WHAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN DURATION : FAMILY CHARACTERISTICS Importance of Maintaining Good Relationship with Pa rtner: Women who had stopped breastfeeding reported significantly gr eater relationship stress than those who continued breastfeeding. Finding Help for Household Duties: Those who stopped breastfeeding had more responsibility for a greater number of househo ld tasks than those who continued. More Time with Baby Increases Breastfeeding: Women who cited greater responsibility for infant care tasks had lower odds of quitting breastfeeding. Role of the Father: Men's support for breastfeeding (especially exclusi ve) during pregnancy predicted the mother breastfeeding for a longer time. Sullivan, et al. Family characteristics associated with duration of breastfeeding duration early infan cy among primiparas. J Hum Lact 20(2); 195-205 . We believe that the concept of confidence in breast feeding should be addressed in any program aimed at promoting breastfeeding and the mo ther should be allowed open discussion of this doubt or confidence. This method of intervention may help a woman to find the reason behind the discrepancy between h er idealized desire to continue breastfeeding and her lack of confidence that she c an actually continue. Understanding this may help increase her confidence in her intend ed behavior. -Ertem, et al. The timing and predictors of the earl y termination of breastfeeding. Pediatrics, 2001; 1 07: 543-546. Attitudinal barriers are more important than structural barriers with breastfeeding duration Extrinsically motivated women were least likely to continue breastfeeding even with support and instruction The key difference between extrinsically and intrinsically motivated women was their strong emotional attachment to breastfeeding 4A final study that helped inform our revised model of comprehensive support looked at the different menta l pathways that lead to doing or not doing a particul ar behavior (avoiding meat, doing vigorous exercise, breastfeeding). Rather than confirming the commonly held belief that not doing something is the result of a weak intention to do the desired behavior, the study found that doing and no t doing a behavior have separate and not necessarily opposite mental proces ses. Commonly cited reasons for wanting to breastfeed include infant health, na turalness, and bonding, while reasons for formula feeding include wanting to invo lve the father, concerns about the baby getting enough milk, and balancing life, w ork and breastfeeding. What determines the direction an individual will go in i s how well the behavior connects to other important goals. Therefore, a suc cessful approach to increasing long term breastfeeding will allow for mothers to i ndividually explore both sides of the intended behavior as well as how breastfeedi ng supports other goals of importance to her. A Public Health Approach to Lactation Support The literature on increasing breastfeeding duration and exclusivity shows a complex and interconnected front for intervention. To adequately address the numerous issues that impact long-term exclusive bre astfeeding, a multifaceted approach is required. Thankfully WIC's unique role as a public health nutrition program provides a fertile ground for initiating a public health lactation program. To consider what a public health lactation program would look like, it's helpful to clearly define public health. The side bar (left ) offers two well accepted definitions of the term. While the definitions diff er somewhat, both focus on working at the community level and on the larger is sues that impact health. This differs from a clinical approach which centers on t he more immediate medical issues of individuals. The distinctive characteris tics that define public health are listed below. DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS Focus on p revention Grounded in science Basis in social justice Recognizes political nature of health Dynamic and ever expanding agenda Mixed culture of public health workers Turnock, B. Public Health: What it is and how it wo rks. Aspen Publishers, Maryland, 1997. Richetin, et al. Not doing is not the opposite of doing: Implications for attitudinal models of behavioral prediction. Personality & Social Psychology Bulletin; 37(1): 40-54. Two Definitions of Public Health \"Fulfilling society's interest in assuring conditions in which people can be healthy.\" (IOM, 1988) \"The science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health and efficiency through organized community effort.\" (Winslow, 1920) 5How do the unique characteristics of a public healt h program help build the framework for a comprehensive breastfeeding support program? First, the emphasis is very much on prevention. This is eviden t in the amount of contacts the model calls for while participants are still pr egnant. After the baby is born, the goal is to contact mothers early and often, hea ding off problems before they start. In other words, a public health lactation pr ogram is not meant to primarily address clinical breastfeeding issues or to put mos t of its time and resources in clean-up and recovery from breastfeeding disasters that have already occurred. Although the model certainly provides for extensive postpartum breastfeeding support for individuals, a greater proportion of ti me is allotted for prevention efforts aimed at groups of mothers-to-be. While public health differs from the medical model in its focus on prevention at the population level, it still shares a similar gro unding in science. In fact every aspect of the comprehensive breastfeeding support m odel strives to be evidence- based to the extent of the knowledge currently avai lable. However, as suggested in the second definition of public health, the prac tice is a balance of science and art, meaning that public health uses multiple metho ds and channels for delivering its work. As it also recognizes that politics impact health a nd that health is interconnected to social justice, a public health program reaches beyond the clinic walls to bring about changes in health. From a practical standpoi nt that means moving from simply educating on the technical aspects of breast feeding to helping to facilitate ah-ha moments so mothers can make their own breastf eeding discoveries. It also means working to form community-wide collaborations to make conditions more favorable for breastfeeding mothers, and stren gthening alliances with other organizations that serve the same population. Final ly, it can mean advocating for changes in the political realm to strengthen legal supports for lower-income families. The last aspect of a public health program is that it draws people from multiple personal and professional backgrounds into its prac tice. This lends itself well to our approach to lactation support because the needs are varied and the solutions are complex. Pulling together a team of people with different perspectives and experiences with breastfeeding strengthens our abil ity to provide effective support. 6Meeting Women's Prenatal Care Desires Pregnancy can be a time of mixed emotions for many mothers-to-be, with almost all feeling a combination of excitement, uncertaint y, and occasionally fear. The quality of the interactions women have with their prenatal care team can be a critical fac tor in building a mother's confidence in her ability to de liver, as well as breastfeeding her baby in the way she envisioned . In her review of 36 articles on women's experiences with p renatal care, Novick identified the following aspects to be positively identified w ith desirable prenatal care. Reasonable wait times and unhurried visits A series of comprehensive and coordinated visits Information that is tailored to their needs A welcoming environment for their significant other s A strong relationship with their care providers The chance to be a more active participant in their own care Opportunities to meet with other pregnant women Unfortunately these same studies showed that many w omen's prenatal care experiences were less than ideal. One study found o ne-third of women reported wait times of 60 minutes or more for prenatal appoi ntments. Five other studies discovered that many women found prenatal care to b e impersonal, describing their experience as mechanistic and that every visi t seemed repetitive. Women became frustrated with their care when they felt th at providers had not listened to them, treated their questions as unimportant, or gave inadequate explanations or answers. Not surprisingly, women pr eferred seeing the same provider or team at each visit. Three large studies found that satisfaction with prenatal care was related to the amount, range, and adequacy of information received. Women wanted specific information about 1 ) what to expect in pregnancy, 2) self-care, 3) labor and birth, 4) inf ant care, 5) family planning, 6) dealing with stress and conflict, and 7) partner's role. Overall, women want less formal, more intimate relationships with care provi ders, a welcoming environment where they can get answers to questions that meet their needs, and an opportunity to be active participants in the ir own care. Novick, G. (2009) Women's Experience of Prenatal Care: An integrative review. J Midwifery & Women's Health; 54:226-237. 7 A Comprehensive Team Approach to Prenatal Breastfeeding Support Delivering on these desires is quite a challenge gi ven the typical prenatal environment, whether it is in a busy doctor's offic e or WIC clinic. Our current model of an all purpose new pregnant certification appointment followed by an hour long breastfeeding class doesn't allow us to a ddress the underlying issues that influence breastfeeding, take a public health appro ach to our work, or deliver the kind of prenatal services women want. Even with th e addition of telephone calls from a peer counselor, it is hard to deliver a trul y comprehensive experience, which leads us to explore other possible methods. Looking to the literature once again, we find Centering Pregnancy as a promising approach fo r reshaping our prenatal support. Centering Pregnancy is a model for prenatal care p rovision that substitutes one-on-one care visits for ten, 2- hour group sessions. The groups begin at 3 to 4 months of preg nancy, with women with similar due dates grouped together. In this model, the participant is seen as an equal partner in her care and she works actively with her care providers to d evelop goals and appropriate means to reach these goals. Groups center on women doing their own self-care and assessment (blood pressure, weight) and consist of facilitated discussions around pregnancy, birth and parenting. More invasive physi cal exams are conducted in a screened off area to provide a measure of privacy. Initial trials of this model with high risk urban mothers showed significant improvem ents in birth outcomes. More recent trials with a greater diversity of popu lations have showed mixed results. With the more recent studies, it has been suggested that complete substitution of individual prenatal care with group s may leave gaps, but adapting this approach in allied settings (such as WIC) has promise. Our group model has half as many sessions, and runs for only an hour, but the focus is the same. While our staff work as facilita tors, it is the women themselves that act as primary teachers. As we learned during our participant centered education training, the most important change talk is what you hear yourself say, not what you hear from others. Allowing sufficient time for reflection and self- discovery keeps participants as equal partners in t he learning process. The other participants serve as teachers as well. Studies sho w that women enjoy hearing from other pregnant women in that it assures them they a ren't the only ones who are experiencing something and it helps them know they aren't crazy! Ample opportunities for group and partner sharing allow f or women to teach each other. In addition, the groups include a Mother's Journal to allow the opportunity for extensive reflection. Schindler Rising, S, et al.. (2004) Redesigning Prenatal Care through CenteringPregnancy. J Midwifery & Womens Health; 49:398-404. 8 General Flow of Enrollment in Prenatal Groups Women attending a new pregnant appointment should b e offered the comprehensive breastfeeding support program, unless the caseload maximum for your agency has been exceeded. To track the charact eristics of women who accept, refuse or are not offered the breastfeeding support program, a mandatory question has been added to the prenatal health history quest ionnaire, where the certifier will select the corresponding option from the drop down menu. A corresponding report can be run by the peer counselor coordinator from TWIST, giving a convenient list of who would like to enroll. The pe er counselor coordinator will use the assign peer counselor button on the enrollm ent screen to officially place the participant in the peer counseling program and assi gn her a peer counselor. The coordinator will then schedule the woman into an ap propriate class series based on her due date. Attendance at group sessions will be recorded by marking show or no show on the group NE screen. Individual contacts wi ll be tracked with the BF tracking tabs. 9 THE BREASTFEEDING SUPPORT PROGRAM ENROLLMENT FLOW As the aim of the comprehensive breastfeeding suppo rt model is to work intensively with mothers during their pregnancy to build their breastfeeding self-efficacy and prevent problems before they happ en, women should not be enrolled in the group series beyond the end of thei r 5 th month of pregnancy. Important! Enrollment deadline for program participation Participants attending a new pregnant appointment are offered the breastfeeding support program. Certifier notes in TWIST whether it is accepted, refused or not offered. Participant completes enrollment. PC Coordinator runs report from TWIST. Is the participant in the 5 th month or less of her pregnancy and interested in the group prenatal series? Yes , the breastfeeding peer counselor coordinator enrolls participant in the group prenatal series based on her expected due date. No , client is beyon d her 5 th month of pregnancy or is clearly unable to regularly attend the group prenatal series. Alternative contact methods may be offered as available. 10 An Overview of the Group Series The five sessions in the prenatal group series begi n at the 4 th month of pregnancy and end in the 8 th month. The classes can be primarily led by the pee r counselor coordinator with the peer counselors always present and playing a significant role in greeting the participants, facilitating activiti es, carrying out role plays, and doing one-on-one counseling with mothers. In addition, be tween each of the five monthly group sessions the peer counselor will make a follo w up contact with the group participants. These contacts can check in on topics discussed in the previous group, dive deeper into issues a participant doesn't feel comfortable discussing with the group, provide more detailed information or referra ls, and serve as an invitation to the next group. A group telephone call is another o ption, if appropriate, and may be a good way of reconnecting women back to the gro up if they have missed a class. If desired and approved by the local agency, Facebook or another social media site may be used to interact with the group. Group 1: Congratulations, You're Pregnant! Now What ? Group 2: Your Amazing Body and Fascinating Baby! Group 3: And Baby Makes Three but What about Me? Group 4: Mommy: A Baby's Natural Habitat Group 5: The Pre-Party before the Big Event! The primary goal of the group sessions is to increa se the breastfeeding self-efficacy of participants. Self-e fficacy is a cognitive process of individuals' confidence in the ir perceived ability to regulate their motivation, thought proce sses, emotional states, and social environment in perform ing a specific behavior. Self-efficacy has been shown thr ough decades of research to be predictive of health beha viors. When selecting, doing, and maintaining a particular behavior, people consider four types of information; 1) performance accomplishments, 2) vicarious experienc es, 3) verbal persuasion, and 4) their interpretation of situations that cause emoti onal arousal. Each session is structured to subtly touch on each of the four areas that influence behavior choice. Taking performance accomplishments as an example, session two aims to address this by showing how much each parti cipant's body has succeeded in preparing itself for breastfeeding and adds valu e to this achievement by discussing the complexity of what has occurred. The concept of vicarious experiences is met by our multi-disciplinary team a nd the group format. Mothers can observe how others deal with the same issues co mmon to pregnancy and new Participants can miss Session 1 if they enroll in the 5th month of their pregnancy Dennis, CL. (1999) Theoretical underpinnings of breastfeeding confidence: A self-efficacy framework. J Hum Lact; 15 (3):195-201. 40% of Oregon WIC participants enroll in the 1 st trimester. 70% are enrolled by the end of the 2 nd trimester. The majority of women are enrolled prior to our end of 5 th month deadline. 11 motherhood. The model also allows for regular verba l persuasion in that lactation consultants, peer counselors, and fellow group part icipants can provide praise for new skills or goals made. The final concept, interp retation of situations that cause emotional arousal, is covered in each class by invi ting participants to reflect upon and plan for the inevitable tough spots that come a long with pregnancy and breastfeeding. By planning ahead and seeing how oth ers deal with a situation, hopefully a mother can have a more positive reactio n when the situation arises. To further assist the process of individual reflection and planning, a Mother's Journal is a core part of the groups. In addition to serving a s a place to write down appointments and important memories, the Journal ha s reflective questions corresponding to each of the group sessions. Documenting Group Attendance and Individual Contacts or Attempted Contacts The group prenatal series will be entered into TWIS T in the same way that other group nutrition education classes are currently sch eduled. If you would like, you can make a separate topic area for breastfeeding pe er counseling and then make add the names of each of the 5 group sessions. Keep in mind that you'll need a way to distinguish which group is which, as you'll have mu ltiple groups of women at different places in the series at the same time. To help keep these different groups straight you might want to add specific names such as \"rosebud group\" or \"May moms\" to the class name. As with current nutrition education classes, you will use the group scheduler function to show or no-show a p articipant based on her attendance. Individual contacts or attempts will be tracked using the Breastfeeding Tracking tab. Navigating the Group Series Guide The following five sections contain detailed, scrip ted outlines for each of the group sessions. To help make the scripts easier to read a nd move through, different sections are marked with the icons in the table bel ow. It is important to note that the dialogue in the scripts is not meant to be followed word for word. They are simply there to give you ideas about what language you MIGHT use to introduce, transition and close topics. Feel free to take the script and make it match with your natural style of speaking. While the class content is carefully structured to meet the objectives of each session, there is no one right w ay to do it. Bottom line; have fun with it and make it your own! 12 Icon Key /quotedbllftbld Facilitator Dialogue /conference Group Discussion Group Activity E Mother's Journal Exercise /movies/movies/movies/movies Video Clip Homework Gift 13 Group Session One CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE PREGNANT! NOW WHAT? GROUP DESCRIPTION : From the moment you first realized you were pregnan t you've been making choices about everything from pr enatal care to baby items. With so many opinions about what is \"best,\" how do you sort it all out? In this session we strip away the hype from the marketing c ampaigns of the baby-product industry; giving you the straight-up facts on the d ecisions you're facing right now. AUDIENCE : Women in the 4th month of pregnancy OBJECTIVES : 1) Normalize the act of breastfeeding and introduce im portance of skin to skin 2) Explore the differences between breast milk and for mula in terms of health and developmental impacts for mother and inf ant 3) Help facilitate the exploration of each mother's in dividual motivations for breastfeeding, her breastfeeding go als, strengths, and challenges 4) Analyze the differences between exclusive and parti al breastfeeding 5) Build relationships among group members 6) Create excitement for attending the remaining sessi on Se ssion 1 14 WELCOME AND INTRODUCTION OF THE WIC SUPPORT TEAM Good morning/afternoon and welcome to your first gr oup for mothers-to- be. My name is________ and I'll be leading our disc ussions on getting ready for the birth of your baby and breastfeeding. I'd a lso like to introduce (peer counselor(s)) who will be working with me to facili tate the groups and will be checking in with you during your pregnancy and a fter the baby is born to see how things are going. (You can mention train ing or credentials, personal experience of staff if desired). (If appro priate, mention other WIC or external staff who will contribute to the group series). EXPLAINING THE PURPOSE AND LOGISTICS OF THE GROUPS If you'll notice we're sitting in a circle today, a nd that's because the goal of our group is to work together to help everyone have a good pregnancy and make a strong connection with their baby. Everyone here is due about the same time, so as you go forward in your pregnancies you'll be having a lot of the same experiences. This is handy because so m any times moms feel like they're the only one having that pain or crazy dreams, and I think through each other, you'll find what you think is o nly you, is actually almost everybody. Our goal for these groups is to cover the things th at aren't in books, on websites, or in typical childbirth education classe s. Over the years we've seen the most common things that trip people up dur ing their pregnancies and in the first six months after their baby is bor n. The truth is there's so much more to becoming a par ent than just understanding the labor process or how to change a diaper. Since we knew that we couldn't fit everything you need to know in just a single one hour class, we put together a series of 5 groups to give enough time to really explore the things most people never really think o f. Once a month, the same group of us will get togethe r (at this place, time) and share what's happening now in our pregnancies, learn amazing things about our body and baby that hardly anyone knows, e xplore ways to keep our relationships together after the baby, learn ab out practices in the hospital that can help or hurt early bonding with y our baby, and of course we'll talk about breastfeeding. Another plus of com ing together once a month is that it gives you the chance to break away from all your other responsibilities and have dedicated time just to th ink about how you want /quotedbllftbld /quotedbllftbld 15 things to be with your baby. So with that long intr oduction, I'll pause a minute for any questions you have. SETTING THE GROUND RULES One last thing I wanted to mention is that I know t here is a wide range of experiences among our group. Some of you are first time mothers and some of you are quite experienced. Everyone has differen t opinions about what to do during pregnancy and how to feed and raise yo ur baby when it's born. We're going to talk about a lot of different things during our time together, so I would ask that if someone has an opi nion that's different than yours, that you respect their feelings on the topic. I want to be sure that everyone feels safe to share their true though ts and concerns with the group. How does that sound to everyone? Well I think I've talked enough. If it's all right with you, I'd like to get started with our discussion for today? I can't wait to get to know each one of you and hear about the plans you have for your b aby! GROUP INTRODUCTIONS /GETTING ACQUAINTED To get us going, I'd ask each of you to turn to the person to your right and share your first name, when you're due, and somethi ng interesting or surprising that has happened in your pregnancy so f ar. Now I'd like you to turn to the person on your left , tell her your name and due date, but this time since we're in WIC and we'r e a nutrition program, share one good thing you've heard about breastfeedi ng. EXPLORING THE BENEFITS OF BREASTFEEDING Who would like to share some of the good things the y've heard about breastfeeding? (Jot down answers on board or flip c hart) It seems as though a lot of you know about the heal th benefits of breastfeeding and some of you thought about the mon ey it saves you too. What are some other reasons a mother might want to breastfeed beyond the health benefits and savings (jot down other ide as)? /quotedbllftbld 16 REFLECTING ON PERSONAL BREASTFEEDING HOPES AND MOTIV ATIONS Now we've generated this great list, I wanted to gi ve each one of you a Journal that's yours to keep. Not only does it have a lot of neat information and resources, it helps you keep track of your appointments and it has little exercises that we'll do together when we meet. They give you a chance to quietly think to yourself about dif ferent things and then write down your answer. If you turn to Session 1, p age 3, you'll see a spot for you to write down how long you're hoping to bre astfeed and what your main reasons are for wanting to breastfeed. Re member this is just for you, and if you don't know right now that's okay to o. I'll give you a couple minutes to do this and then we'll come back and explore together how much formula and breast milk are the same or di fferent. I think there's a lot of things we'll find are surprising a bout the two. DISCOVERING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BREAST MILK AND FORMULA Use grab bag full of Legos, index cards, sticky not es that will adhere to a flip chart or any other method you'd like to explor e the contents of formula vs. breast milk. Have participants draw out a Lego or index card and then guess whether both formula and breast milk have that element or only breast milk has it. You can draw a matrix with formula on one side, breast milk on the other and visually mark whether an element is in one or both. Also use the opportunity to explore the diffe rent forms of elements that are in both breast milk and formula, marking w ith an asterisk when there are important differences between the sources of an element. For example: Carbohydrates: yes, both formula and breast milk ha ve them, but are they the same kind of carbohydrates and does it matter? Proteins: yes, both have proteins but again are the y the same kind? Who has heard of a formula that claims to have \"com fort proteins?\" What do you think they really mean by that? Fats: yes, both have fats, but (and I bet you're ca tching on by now), are they the same? Who has heard about the fats DHA and EPA? If the DHA in breast milk comes from your body, where do you think the DHA in formula comes from? Vitamins and minerals: present in both, but differ in how well your baby can absorb them. Example: iron absorbed 5 time s as well from human milk than cow's milk. Anti-infective properties: things called immunoglob ulins protect your baby against infection; only breast milk Growth factors: help mature the lining of the gut E 17 Different flavors: yes the foods you eat flavor you r milk Changes in composition from feed to feed and within a feed: in fact the breast milk of a preterm infant's mother has hi gher amounts of protein and fat, matching it exactly to the needs o f her baby. White blood cells: protect your baby from getting s ick by destroying the cell walls of viruses Lactobacillus (Like the stuff in yogurt): promotes growth of good bacteria in your baby's gut Enzymes: help your baby with digestion (Add your favorites as desired) So after our activity, what are your thoughts about the differences between breast milk and formula? (allow time for short disc ussion) The list we went through was just a quick look at h ow different breast milk and formula really are. The poster I'm hanging up r ight now really shows you the difference. (Then can unfurl the big breast milk vs. formula poster and invite people to look at it at the end of the g roup.) What are your first thoughts on seeing this? (open for comments) Seems like breast milk is pretty powerful stuff. Wh at have you heard about how long to breastfeed? (Gather responses then shar e AAP, WHO recommendations). REFLECT ON NEW INFORMATION ABOUT BREAST MILK VS . FORMULA With all we've just talked about, I'd like to give you a minute to go back to your Journal and write down anything new about what your hopes are for breastfeeding or your reasons for wanting to do so. Then we'll have a chance to move around the room a bit. EXPLORING BREASTFEEDING INTENTION AND CONFIDENCE To give us a chance to get up and stretch a bit, I have a short activity that follows what we just wrote about in our Journal. Yo u'll see that we've just put down different spots on the floor and they're n umbered 1 through 10. Number one represents not wanting to breastfeed at all and only wanting to give formula, number five is that you're somewhe re in the middle maybe giving equal amounts of formula and breast milk. Nu mber 10 means that you are never, ever giving your baby formula. And t he numbers in between represent those ideas to a stronger or lesser degre e. Remembering that there is no right or wrong place to be, I'd love it if we could line up where we think we are right now in our decision about how to feed our baby. /conference E 18 (Remind again about 1 to 10 scale as they move to p osition). Who's willing to share why they chose the number they did? Now, to make it a little bit more interesting, I'd like you to take a walk in someone else's shoes for a minute. Not that you hav e to exchange shoes but I'm going to ask you to move to another place on th e line and then think about what someone at that point in the line might be thinking about their decision about how to feed their baby. Now you've h ad a chance to get settled in your new spot, would anyone like to shar e what they think would be going through the mind of someone in your new spot? Who would like to share what they're thinking now they' re in a different spot on the line? Thank all of you for being so honest about where yo u are in your feeding decisions. What you feel today might not be what yo u feel tomorrow or next month, and that's okay. Again the goal of our group is to uncover little known facts about pregnancy, women's bodies, birthing practices, and infant feeding but it's also to give us a little ti me to think about how we feel about all these things. CLASS WRAP UP/I NCENTIVE ITEM /P LUG NEXT CLASS In our last few minutes together I wanted to give y ou a sneak preview of what we'll be talking about next month. Of course w e'll all share what's been happening in our pregnancies since we last met and taking a look at what your baby's doing in the fifth month. Then we' re going to look at some little known but amazing abilities of your bod y. And you won't believe what your baby is up to while still in the womb that makes them so much more capable when they're born than you might have imagined. Let me just leave you by saying that after our next gro up, you'll never look at this part of your body (draw line in air from below breasts to head) the same again. There are two things that I invite you to do before we see each other again next month. The first of course is to share the inf ormation we explored with the important people in your life and then ask your mother or someone else close to you about their experiences w ith breastfeeding. The second is to visit the website for La Leche league. /quotedbllftbld /quotedbllftbld Smith, Linda. Coach's Notebook: games and strategies for lactation education. Page 41-42, Feeding Line Game You can buy numbered floor dots at www.spotdots.net 19 We've listed the link in the back of your Journal. They have a lot of great information about breastfeeding, cool videos and I think you'll really enjoy it. (Peer counselor) will be calling before our next m eeting to check on how things are going and answer any questions that migh t have come up. To close our group, I'd like to celebrate your pregnan cy with a few beautiful images of where you are now and what's to come. (mo m-baby slide show) As we're looking at these, I have a little gift to give everyone here. This is a magnetic picture frame you can use to hold your ult rasound picture, which most of you should be having pretty soon. I can't wait to see each one of you next month, to hear what has happened in the time between groups, and to have more fun wi th you talking about your amazing body and amazing baby. I think you're going to love it and I know (peer counselor) and I will love seeing all of you again. /quotedbllftbld 20 Group Session Two YOUR AMAZING BODY AND FASCINATING BABY! GROUP DESCRIPTION : As your pregnancy has progressed you've likely noticed big changes in your body and with your baby too! In this session we reveal little known secrets about the extraordinary abilities of a woman's body and the fascinating behaviors of babies in the womb . You'll come away amazed by how mother and baby automatically make physical and emotional changes that help them adapt and thrive in pregnancy, birth and beyond. AUDIENCE : Women in the 5th month of pregnancy OBJECTIVES : 1) Familiarize mothers with the changes taking place i n their bodies and how that helps them care for their baby 2) Introduce concept of skin-to-skin contact 3) Explore the presence and roles of colostrum 4) Discover baby behaviors that facilitate breastfeedi ng 5) Reflect on each mother's own strengths and perceive d challenges for fulfilling her breastfeeding plans Se ssion 2 21 WELCOME AND INTRODUCTION OF NEW GROUP MEMBERS Good morning/afternoon and welcome back or welcome for the first time for those of you who are new. Everyone should be ab out in their month 5 now, so if we could just go around and introduce ou rselves again and share one interesting thing that we're noticing at this p oint in our pregnancy, that will give our new moms a chance to get to know us all. (Peer counselor) and I can start, but we don't have any e xciting pregnancy updates to share. HOMEWORK CHECK -IN At the end of our last group we talked about sharin g the information you learned about the differences between breast milk a nd formula with your friends and family, and maybe talking with your mom about how she fed you. Who would like to share whether they did this and how it went? We also gave you the link for the La Leche League w ebsite. How many took time to check it out? Who's willing to share s omething they liked? LINKING LAST SESSION TO THIS SESSION The last time we were together we took some time fo r you to think about what your hopes are for breastfeeding and your reas ons for wanting to breastfeed. First we explored together the real dif ferences between formula and breast milk. Then we lined up to show where we were in thinking about breastfeeding. We also wrote down our hopes and reasons for wantin g to breastfeed in our Journal. I wanted to give you a minute to let y ou revisit what you wrote and give those who are new a chance to write something too. If you go to the next page in your Journal, you'll see that there are two more questions there. The first one asks you to lis t reasons why you think you and your baby will do well with breastfeeding. Take a minute and jot down a few of your ideas. /quotedbllftbld /conference /quotedbllftbld E 22 EXPLORING THE GAP BETWEEN DESIRED AMOUNT OF BREASTFE EDING AND ACTUAL LENGTH OF BREASTFEEDING Seems like everyone was able to think of at least o ne reason why they'll do well at breastfeeding. When we met last time, we ta lked about the recommendation to exclusively breastfeed (giving no formula) for six month, and continuing to breastfeed beyond that for a year or more along with introducing foods. Using your best guess, how many mothers actually do just give breast milk to their babies for the first six months? (answer 3 5% of Oregon WIC moms do). What do you think happens with the other 65%? We kn ow that since over 90% of Oregon WIC moms start out breastfeeding that it's something that they want to do, so what could be happening along t he way that changes that? (open for short discussion, acknowledging eac h possibility). Now that we've had a chance to talk about what migh t get in the way of other moms breastfeeding for as long as they want, I'd like us to go to our Journal once again and answer the second question o n that page, about what might be some challenges for you. I see that everyone has finished writing, and rathe r than having everyone share right now, I'd like to throw out a statement and have you tell me what your first thoughts are about it. \"Almost every mother can give her baby only breast milk (no formula) for the first year of her baby's life.\" (open floor for discussion knowing that someone wil l point out not everyone can because of biological issues, back to work, separation from baby and so forth). So I'm hearing that some of you mainly agree with t his statement and others have experienced problems or know someone wh o felt like they couldn't exclusively breastfeed. Since we have a bi t of controversy about this, I thought we could spend a little time talkin g about it. If it's alright with the group, I thought we might look at the biol ogical part; how your body and your baby automatically get ready to breas tfeed. /quotedbllftbld /conference E /conference 23 EXPLORING CHANGES IN MOTHER 'S BODY TO HELP WITH BREASTFEEDING Let's start with an activity that explores what's h appening right now with your body to help you with breastfeeding. What I ha ve here are a series of pictures, and I'd love for us to guess as a group, what kind of change they represent. (Hold up picture of a woman's head or a brain) And this is a picture of... Yes! Your brain, but this is your brain on baby. What do you think is already happening in your brain to help you get ready for b reastfeeding?\" (Collect responses and add few key facts if not men tioned. But don't overdo here as it's not the main point of the class ). One important thing your brain is doing right now i s producing lots of a hormone called prolactin. This hormone is not only responsible for making your breasts get bigger but it also helps change th e structure inside your breasts so you can make milk. And since we've already broug ht up the bigger breast issue, let's think about what is happening with you r breasts themselves. To get us up and moving, I've posted in different s pots around the room nine different breast changes and given each one of you a set of stickers. I'd like each one of you to place a sticker on the changes that y ou've seen happening with your breasts so far. Again, what happens from perso n to person and when it happens varies, so don't feel worried if you haven' t seen all nine. Larger breasts and more visible veins: yes breast t ypically double in weight, its absolutely normal for one to be slightl y bigger than the other Bigger aerola: acts a visual target for baby Darker aerola Bigger bumps around the nipple: Montgomery glands t hat secrete a fluid that helps moisturize the breast; fluid has s ame smell as amniotic fluid which helps baby find the breast Bigger nipples Tender breasts Tender nipples Breasts leaking colostrum Let's use (these grapes, balloon where you draw on internal breast structure, breast model) to take a peak at what your breasts l ook like on the inside. Just like this bunch of grapes, your breast have li ttle cluster of cells that are 24 connected to one another and make milk. When other cells push down on them the milk goes into a series of ducts (or conne cting pipes) in your breasts. So here's my question for you. How does the milk ac tually get out of your breast and inside your baby? One idea many people have is that the nipple has on ly one opening, just like a straw and that the baby sucks milk out, again in a similar way that you do with a straw? Who has heard that it works that way? I'd like to surprise you with the fact that you act ually have around 10 openings in your nipple, and far from being sucked out like milkshake through a straw, your breast milk actually sprays out. We'll talk mo re a bit later about how the baby helps make this happen too. For my last one I have something less obvious. Let' s focus on this picture, specifically the skin on her upper chest. Does anyo ne want to guess what's magic about this part of you?\" Believe it or not, the skin on your upper chest is more accurate than an incubator in maintaining your baby's temperature. I f your baby is placed on your chest, skin-to-skin, that part of your body ca n actually raise or lower by a couple degrees to heat or cool off your baby. Men h ave some ability to do this to, but their skin can only rise in temperature, no t lower. We're going to talk more about the importance of sk in-to skin contact at another time but I wanted you to start thinking abo ut how that might influence where you want your baby to be once its b orn. COLOSTRUM : YOU 'VE ALREADY GOT IT I have a question for the group. If push comes to s hove, how ready is your body to breastfeed right now, today? (open for disc ussion) Believe it or not, after about the 16 th week of pregnancy your body starts making milk. Some people leak some of this milk and others don't. Either way is totally normal. Who has heard what this very first milk is called? (Colostrum) How is it different than the milk you make later on ? (thicker, yellowish, full of antibodies, comes out in little drops not b ig gushes). What makes colostrum really important for you baby? (1 st immunization) /conference 25 EXPLORING BABY 'S PREPARATION FOR BREASTFEEDING Alright, we've talked about all the changes that yo ur body undertakes all on its own. Let's talk about your baby. What behaviors are they doing while still in the womb that helps them to breastfeed? (Discuss t humb sucking, swallowing, etc) Now thinking about your baby just after it's born, how well do you think they can breastfeed completely on their own? With no one directing them how or even placing them by the breast? (Collect comments quickly) I have a brief video clip I'd like to show you, and then I'd like to get your opinion on that again. (Show breast crawl or biolo gical nurturing video) What are your thoughts after seeing this video? (op en for discussion) Let's take a minute and talk about a few other beha viors we saw the baby in the video do that helps a lot with breastfeeding (head bobbing, arm circling, mouth opens with touch of palette, etc). What have you noticed about baby noses? How does th at help with breastfeeding (they are flat so can have tight conn ection and breathe). CLASS WRAP UP/I NCENTIVE ITEM /P LUG NEXT CLASS So we've seen from taking a closer look at what hap pens with your body and your baby that a good foundation for successful breastfeeding is already there. I want to acknowledge that there are mothers and babies who have certain surgeries or medical conditions that will m ake breastfeeding more challenging. But most moms start using formula for reasons that aren't really medical. I know we've talked about a lot of things today, an d I wanted to give you the chance to go back to your Journal one more time and look again at what you first wrote about why you think you'll be good at breastfeeding and what challenges you might have, and add to or m ake a note by what you had written before. In our group today and the one before, we've gone o ver a lot of technical information about breast milk, your body, your baby and breastfeeding. Next month we're going totally switch gears and tal k about how to better communicate with the important people in your life, how to help building a system of support for yourself so you're taken ca re of too, and how to /conference /quotedbllftbld E 26 keep your relationship going with your partner once the baby arrives. The skills that we'll learn together next month could b e the key in helping things go smoothly. (Peer counselor) will call you in between to see how things are going and answer any questions you have. If you'd like to do some follow up from this class you can think more about the changes you see your body going through. You might also spend some time considering what your strengths will be f or breastfeeding and what might get in the way. We've also given you a l ist of resources that are available in the community to help with some of the basic things you might need when you're expecting. There's a list of great websites as well if you'd like to learn more. (Optional: may provide in formation on getting fitted for maternity and nursing bras). /checkbld www.breastfeeding.com/reading_room/nursing_bras/fit ting.html /checkbld www.medelabreastfeedingus.com/intimate-apparel-fit- video /checkbld www.herroom.com/maternity-nursing-bras,943,30.html We do have a little gift for you this month, a wond erful full-color pamphlet detailing what happens with you and the baby each m onth of the pregnancy. Plus now that you know that you're a wom an who already has colostrum, we're giving everyone their own set of b reast pads in case you start leaking. Thank you again for coming. I hope you learned some thing new! I can't wait to see you again next month as you near your l ast trimester. I'm sure we'll have lots to tell each other about what chang es have taken place. 27 Group Session Three AND BABY MAKES THREE, BUT WHAT ABOUT ME? GROUP DESCRIPTION : You're only a few months away from meeting your baby! There are so many things to get ready; who c an help? In this session we help you explore how to build a network of support to ge t you through the rest of your pregnancy and the first months after birth. We also get real about how the arrival of a baby can change your relationships, and how to avoid the 4 most common mistakes that put couples at risk after becoming ne w parents. You'll leave with better ideas to tell each other what you need; maki ng a more peaceful environment for welcoming your baby. AUDIENCE : Women in the 6th month of pregnancy. OBJECTIVES : 1) Explore how other people can impact their breastfee ding success. 2) Make decisions about what they want to tell their c are providers and hospital staff about their birthing and breastfeedi ng wishes. 3) Consider what type of help they'll need once the ba by arrives and who might give that help. 4) List who may be more or less helpful with supportin g breastfeeding. 5) Identify the most common issues couples face after the birth of the baby and adopt strategies to overcome them. Se ssion 3 28 WELCOME AND INTRODUCTION OF PARTNERS AND GUESTS Good morning/afternoon and welcome back. I'd like t o give a very special welcome to our guests who've come along just for ou r special group today, and give everyone a chance to introduce themselves once again. You're all starting your last trimester now, and I thought it might be nice to look at a quick video clip that shows how far you've come in your pregnancy and where you're going in these last 3 months. Show 3-D animation clip from Babycenter.com, /checkbld http://www.babycenter.com/2_inside-pregnancy-weeks- 28-to- 37_3658874.bc Who would like to share what was most interesting o r surprising from what we just watched? HOMEWORK CHECK -IN At the end of our last group we invited you to shar e what you learned about what's happening with your body and your baby . Who would like to share what they passed on to others and what their reaction was? LINKING LAST SESSION TO THIS SESSION At our last group we talked about the way your body is getting ready during pregnancy to breastfeed and what your baby i s doing in the womb to get ready too. We also wrote about why we think we'll do well at breastfeeding and what challenges we might come acr oss. EXPLORING IMPACT OF BREASTFEEDING ON THE COMMUNITY To start our thinking about how those around us can help or hurt in our efforts to breastfeed, and how breastfeeding impacts the large r community, we have a fun little activity. I'd like to ask you to break into a few small groups, and then do your best to answer the \"why\" when you read about who is glad you're breastfeeding. I'll give you a few minutes in your groups to come up with some answers, and then we'll get back together and share. Handout \"Who's Glad You're Breastfeeding?\" See Appendix. /quotedbllftbld /movies /conference /quotedbllftbld 29 Who is g lad Why they are glad Garbage man Less waste, diapers not as stin ky Mother nature It's natural, protects environment The Government Saves money over time with health Your OB/GYN or midwife Faster recovery from birth Your baby's pediatrician Reduced risk for many diseases Your favorite clothing store Get back to skinny jeans faster Your dentist Strong jaw muscles and bett er teeth WIC We love breastfeeding! Your bank account Saves a lot of money Your child's future teachers Breastfeeding may boost IQ Your boss or workplace Healthier baby means fewer sick days Your neighbors Diapers not as stinky, may cry less Your family Your friends Your partner You! Let's open the floor for sharing, and see what ever yone came up with. COMMUNICATING PLANS TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS One thing we touched on in our 'who's glad your bre astfeeding game' are reasons why a doctor/midwife might be excited that you're breastfeeding. Opening up our Journal once again, you'll see on Se ssion 3, page 4 there's a place for you to jot down what you think your docto r's/midwife's feelings are about breastfeeding and another spot for you to write down what you want to be sure to tell them about your plans. Let' s take a minute so you can fill these out. Starting the conversation with your doctor can be t ough in the short time you normally have in an appointment. Sometimes it's hard to know just what to ask to find out where they really stand. Th ankfully, the American Academy of Pediatrics has put out a series of quest ions you can ask to see how breastfeeding friendly your doctor really is. I 'll pass that out and we'll talk together about what you might want to be liste ning for in their answers. Tell me about the training you or your staff have h ad in supporting mothers to breastfeed? (look for formal training, c ontinuing education) /quotedbllftbld E Smith, Linda. Coach's Notebook: games and strategies for lactation education. Page to make/pages/ Finding-a-Breastfeeding- Friendly-Doctor.aspx 30 What percentage of babies in your practice are brea stfed? How about exclusively breastfed? How long do you encourage a mother and baby to brea stfeed? When do you recommend introducing other foods? When do you recommend weaning? (should be as desire d) Do you have a lactation consultant in the office if I need it? If not, do you have someone to refer me to? If I go back to work, what are some ways you can he lp me to continue breastfeeding? (breast pumps, letter to em ployer) What are some things I can do during labor to help me get a successful start to breastfeeding? If I have to take medications after birth, what sou rces would you use to determine whether or not the medicine was okay t o use while breastfeeding? (Hale-Medications and Mother's Milk) After looking through these questions I'll give you another second to write down anything you really want to ask next time you see your doctor or if you are deciding on a pediatrician. One other nice resource we have for you is from Jac k Newman, a doctor who has worked for a long time promoting breastfeed ing. He offers some great tips on what to listen for to see if your doc tor's really breastfeeding friendly or not. See Appendix. BUILDING YOUR SUPPORT TEAM Shifting gears a bit, so far we've spent our time l ooking at how those outside our day-to-day life can impact us. Now I'd like to move to those who are closer to you, your friends and family. On page 5 of Session 3, you'll see some questions about who can support you in your decision to breastfeed and what you want them to know. Who would like to share one of the messages that yo u want to be sure to tell either your biggest supporter or your least su pporter? (If no one wants to share that's ok too). Now we've thought a bit about starting to talk wit h friends and family about our wishes, it's good to think about the role they can play once your baby arrives. One of the great things about being p regnant or new parents is that people really want to help you out. Often t imes we just brush off people's offers, but honestly, as new parents we ca n use all the help we can get. Being a new parent is very exciting and reward ing. At the same time it E E 31 can be tiring and stressful. Although you want to s pend most of your time getting to know your baby, the other parts of your life don't stop. That's where friends and family come in. What I'm handing out now is a list of tasks that most people need help with after the arr ival of their baby. I'll let you take a look and think more about what you'll ne ed help with, and who that might be. (Based on the time available you ca n have them complete all this in the group or just do one or two and have th em finish the rest at home). See Appendix. DRIVE ME TO HOSPITAL TO DELIVER TAKE CARE OF MY OTHER KIDS WHILE I GIVE BIRTH AND AM AT HOSPITAL SPEAK OUT FOR WHAT I WANT DURING THE BIRTH NOTIFY FRIENDS AND FAMILY AFTER THE BABY 'S BORN DO CROWD CONTROL AT THE HOSPIAL AND WHEN WE FIRST G ET HOME SO I 'LL HAVE QUIET TIME WITH MY BABY DRIVE US HOME FROM HOSPITAL DO SOME LOADS OF LAUNDRY DO AN EMERGENCY DIAPER RUN SHOP FOR GROCERIES FIX MEALS HELP CLEAN THE HOUSE LET ME TAKE A SHOWER LET ME GET A QUICK NAP HELP WITH MY PETS PLAY WITH MY OLDER CHILDREN GET MY OLDER CHILDREN TO SCHOOL DRIVE ME TO DOCTOR 'S APPOINTMENTS TAKE CARE OF MY OLDER KIDS WHILE I GO TO THE DOCTOR HELP ME GET TIME TO EXERCISE Who would like to share any of their plans from thi s? Were there any tasks on here that you hadn't thought about as something to ask for help? TASK WHO 32 KEEPING YOUR PARTNERSHIP STRONG Keeping with our inward movement from the community , to health care providers, to your friends and family, let's move i n one more level. It's time to talk about keeping your most intimate relat ionships together after the baby. I have a pop quiz for you. In the first three years after their babies were born, 2/3rds of parents said the quality of their r elationship: increased, decreased, or stayed the same? (Open for guesses) As some of you guessed, their relationship satisfac tion decreased. What are some of the reasons for that? (Open again for shari ng, acknowledge each response) John Gottman is a researcher who looks at couples a nd relationship styles and is able to predict very accurately who will spl it and who will stay together. He has found four behaviors that are the strongest predictors of a relationship not making it. Shall we take a look at what those are? See Appendix. 1. Criticism : attacking our partner's personality by pointing o ut their defects (you always, you never, you're lazy, you're a slob) 2. Defensiveness : what we do when we feel criticized. Either we att ack back, proclaim our innocence, whine like a victim, or act put-out and resentful. 3. Contempt : giving insults that focus on how we're superior. This can take the form of yelling out insults, rolling our e yes, calling each other bad names, or talking down to our partners. 4. Stonewalling : when we don't like what our partner is saying we become like a stone wall and give no response at al l. 85% of stone wallers are men. I won't ask for an actual show of hands, but silent ly, how many of you think that you've done one or more of these things sometime during your relationship? How do you think these behaviors can make or break how well you work as a couple to adjust to having a new baby? /conference /conference 33 You've hit it right on the head that reacting in th ese ways when conflict arises is just going to make things more difficult. Thankfully, John Gottman also offers an alternative way of communica ting when there's a conflict. What are the three steps to follow when b ringing up an issue? (may have responses laminated or on a large poster page) 1. Say what you feel 2. Describe the problem neutrally with no blame 3. Say what you need (not what you don't need) Let's work through one together. How could we softe n up something like, \"You don't care about me! You only care about yours elf! You are just wrapped up in your own little world, with your face in the computer all the time!\" (write statement on white board or poste r paper) Let's start with saying what you feel. What do you think the feelings are in this statement? (I feel hurt, I feel disappointed, I feel lonely...) Now let's try to describe the problem neutrally wit h no blame. (by your looking at your computer/phone at dinner and our no t talking) And finally let's say what you need and not what yo u don't need. (Would you talk with me so I can ask how your day was and you can hear about mine?) Now we've done one together as a group, I am going to hand out some cards with the same kind of strong statements. Get together with your partner or another person and try changing it using the three steps we just went over. I will give you a couple of minutes and then we'll share with the group. It takes a lot of practice to change what we tend to say. Just have fun with it. Examples for cards: You're so rigid. Your ideas about parenting are rid iculous. You just want to be at work all the time and never be home with us! You just don't care about the baby! You think just because I'm young that I don't know what I'm doing. You just go ahead and do things with the baby witho ut asking me! You never want sex anymore. You're like ice. I'm sick of your mood changes every second. You're like a mine field. I'm sick of never going out. You never take me anyw here. 34 She criticizes me all the time and you do nothing a bout it. You and your mother can go to... How can I ever trust you? You never come home when you say you will. Once you're out the door you just forget abou t us! You never ask me before doing something. You make a ll the decisions. You are so controlling. You go out all the time and I'm stuck here with the baby. You're so selfish! How did it go with working to change these negative statements into something more positive? Who would like to start us off by sharing what their statement was and how they changed it? You did a wonderful job with working through these statements. Conflict is going to happen in every relationship, and for n ew parents when they're stressed and tired, even more so. The secret is try ing to make these arguments constructive and not destructive . At the very least, hopefully from our activity today you can recognize when you' re doing one of the destructive behaviors and then do your best to turn it into something more positive. Who has a question or comment before we move on to the last part of our discussion for today? DADS ARE IMPORTANT TOO The last two issues I thought we might cover today happen at the individual level. The first one has to do with dads . Sometimes when the new baby arrives, a lot of women come to help out m om. That is very wonderful because as we talked about before, having help is a great thing for new parents. At the same time, sometimes dads g et kind of pushed aside, and I know that some moms worry that if they 're breastfeeding, that dad won't have the opportunity to really bond with the baby. So as a group, I thought we might quickly brainstorm some w ays that dads can really get to know and bond with their new baby (an d help out mom too). (open for discussion) /checkbld www.breastfeeding.com/reading_room/dad_help.html (has a good article that you can use as a reference ) /conference 35 CARING FOR YOURSELF Those are a lot of wonderful ideas! Thanks for shar ing. Now I'd like to move on to thinking about you after the baby. As we've mention many times today being a new parent (or grandparent) is fantastic but you're also tired a lot and it's easy to get stressed out and f eel overwhelmed. So as our final activity today, I'd like you to open up your Journal one more time, and answer the questions on page 6, about how you'l l recognize and manage your own stress. CLASS WRAP UP/I NCENTIVE ITEM /P LUG NEXT CLASS So we've seen spent our time today thinking about h ow those around us and ourselves can impact our success as new parents and with breastfeeding. Communicating our hopes and plans to others allows them to provide the kind of support we need and ultimately be more succ essful. Ask others for help and accept it when it's offered. Take the time to recognize when you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed and do your best to take care of yourself and your relationship. Hopefully we've gon e over a few things today that can help you do just that. If you'd like to do some follow up from this class you can work together to make a list of 10 things you don't want to change a fter the baby comes. It also might be good to start talking to friends and family about what help you're going to need before, during and after the b irth. For those of you who are working now and plan to return to work afte r the birth, it's a good time to start the discussion with your employe r about your plans. We've included some good websites that give you adv ice on how to start this conversation. We do have a little gift for you this month, a door hanger that you can use to let people know if you want a little privacy whe n you're learning to breastfeed. We also have some cards that outline yo ur right to breastfeed in public and rights for breastfeeding or pumping when you return to work. Before we go, I'd like to give you a sneak preview of what we'll be talking about next month. As you're all aware, the big even t is getting closer. What we'll cover next month are the most important facto rs for making the first few days with your baby fantastic. You'll come away with ideas about how to make the birthing experience go more smoothly fo r you, how to get an immediate bond with your baby, and the most effecti ve ways to make this happen in the hospital. E /quotedbllftbld 36 Thank you again for coming and an extra thank you t o our guests today. I hope you learned something new! I know it's always helpful for me to practice changing the negative statements into some thing positive. As always, we're hear to answer any questions or conce rns you may have. 37 Group Session Four MOMMY: A BABY'S NATURAL HABITAT GROUP DESCRIPTION : Everyone knows that building and keeping a healthy habitat is essential for plants and animals to thri ve, but seldom do we think about the habitat we'd like to have to welcome our baby. In this session we cover the options for designing your labor and delivery exper ience, finding ways you can create a natural and healthy habitat for your labor and the first hours of bonding with your new baby. AUDIENCE : Women in the 7th month of pregnancy. OBJECTIVES : 1. Identify the key components for building a healthy habitat for birth. 2. Reinforce importance of skin-to-skin contact after birth and beyond. 3. Discuss hospital practices that can help or hinder breastfeeding. 4. Explore participants' feelings about the birth proc ess. Session 4 38 WELCOME Good morning/afternoon and welcome back. I'm so gla d to see each and every one of you. You're all in your 7 th month now, and I'm betting that you're noticing even more changes as your body gets ready for delivery. Who'd like to share what they've noticed about them selves since the last time we met? (can probe if necessary about trouble sleeping, early \"practice\" contractions, etc). HOMEWORK CHECK -IN At the end of our last group we invited you to work with your partner to come up with a list of 10 things you don't want to change after the baby arrives. We also encouraged those of you who are go ing back to work to start talking with your employer. Who would like to share a few of the 10 items they came up with or how it went talking with your employer? LINKING LAST SESSION TO THIS SESSION At our last group we had some fun with our Who's Gl ad You're Breastfeeding game, looking at how our feeding deci sions can impact the larger community. We also did some thinking about t elling other people about our breastfeeding plans, what kind of help we 'll need once the baby arrives and who might provide that help. Finally we focused on keeping your relationship together while having the stress of being new parents and taking care of yourself. Today we're going to cont inue along those same lines by thinking about how you can create the idea l environment for welcoming your baby into the world. INTRODUCING THE CONCEPT OF A HABITAT To get us started, I thought we'd talk a bit about the title of today's group, Mommy: A Baby's Natural Habitat. When we say that m ommy is a baby's natural habitat , what do you think we mean? (Open the floor for discussion) This is great, all your ideas about mommy being the natural habit. To frame our discussion for today just a little bit mo re, I'd like to offer up three different definitions of the word habitat. (l aminated or on poster board) /quotedbllftbld /conference /quotedbllftbld /conference 39 1) The natural conditions and environment in which a p lant or animal lives. 2) The place in which a person or group is usually fou nd. 3) A sealed, controlled environment in which people ca n live in unusual conditions such as under the sea or space PRACTICING YOUR HABITAT DESIGN SKILLS Now we have a few different definitions of habitat, let's take it a step further. I'm going to ask each one of you to imagin e you've just gotten a call from the Oregon zoo, and they have a mother po lar bear who is going to give birth in the next month. As I'm sure many o f you have heard, polar bears are having a tough time right now, so having a successful birth and having the cub survive and thrive is really importa nt. Staff at the zoo have heard what a wonderful mother you are and how good you are at planning for birth and parenthood, and they would like you t o come and put into place the ideal habitat and support system for this polar bear birth. So, with the fate of the world's polar bear populat ion in your hands, I'd like you to (in small groups, pairs, or individuall y) come up with a quick list of the things you think would be most critical to having a successful birth and happy, healthy cub. You can use our defin itions of habitat if you'd like to get you started. (give time to discus s, provide paper and pens for writing things down) Now that we've had some time to think about what's most important for our polar bear birth, who'd like to share some of t he things they came up with? (collect answers) This is wonderful! You've come up with so many thin gs. The zoo was right to call you for advice! Before we leave our polar b ear scenario, I'd like to ask you one more thing. What are the signs you woul d look for to know whether or not things were going well with mommy an d baby polar bear? (collect answers) So there are a lot of signs from both mother and ba by, things like bonding, feeding, and weight gain that you'd use to know whe ther things are going well. If it's alright with you, I'd like to take wh at we've done here and move to thinking about how this applies to us. 40 SHARING OUR FEELINGS ABOUT LABOR AND DELIVERY Now that we've moved from talking about polar bears giving birth, back to ourselves, I thought we might do a quick activity f ind out how we're all feeling about the idea of going through labor and b irth. I've put out series of cards with different images on them. Take a look at the cards that are on the table, and choose the one that best represents your thoughts about labor and delivery right now. (Belo w are examples of different images you can use for the cards; just cr eate a sample that can represent most common feelings). See Appendix. Now that everyone has had a chance to pick a card, let's take a moment and share why you chose that one and what it means to you (open for sharing). Thank you for being so honest about your fears, dou bts and confidence about the upcoming birth experience. If you open up your Journal to page 4, of Session 4, you'll see a spot to jot down your feelings about labor and birth, what might help you if you're feeling worrie d, or what might keep you positive if you're feeling good about it (allow time for writing). Who would like to share some of their thoughts for stay ing positive or how they might overcome some of their fears? E 41 BUILDING YOUR OWN HEALTHY HABITAT (I NTRODUCTION ) One of the ways we can help control some of our con cerns is by getting an accurate vision of what lies ahead (for first time moms) or maybe thinking about how things could be different this time aroun d for our experienced moms. To do this, I hoped we could work together to think about 5 different aspects of the habit (your hospital room) where you'll go through the birth process and welcome your new baby. . So i f it's alright with you, I'd like to bring up a quick video tour of a typica l hospital labor and delivery room so we all get a picture of what to ex pect. (Choose one of the online birth center tours to get people acquainted with the basics they'll encounter). /checkbld www.fletcherallen.org/birthcenter_360/ /checkbld www.health.ucsd.edu/women/child/facilities/virtualt our.htm After looking at this clip, what are some of your t houghts about the place where you'll be giving birth and greeting your new baby? Which definition of habitat does it most resemble? (Open for Discuss ion) What are some things you saw that you felt good abo ut? What are some things you saw that you didn't feel g ood about? BUILDING YOUR OWN HEALTHY HABITAT (K EY COMPONENTS ) So you've mentioned some of the good and not so goo d things about the basic environment you're given in a typical hospita l delivery. Knowing that it's probably not the absolute ideal setting, we ca n help make it a more warm and welcoming place by thinking about those fi ve pieces that I mentioned earlier. So what are the 5 pieces to cons ider when building a happy, healthy habitat for you and baby while you'r e in the hospital? (can post these up) 1) Space: area itself, what's in that space, and how y ou move around in it. 2) Temporal (time): how the space or your use of the s pace changes over time. 3) Overall environment: cleanliness, temperature, poll utants. 42 4) Resources: food, water, shelter, light. 5) Competition: safety and security for you and baby, minimal interference while you and baby bond. So if it's all right with you, I thought we'd plan and talk together about the different things that can influence the b irth environment. Let's talk about your space and time f irst. CONSIDERING THE BASICS (S PACE , TIME , ENVIRONMENT ) One of the most basic questions to start considerin g is who and what you want with you when you go to the hospital to give birth. Who and what are going to make it a more com forting and home-like environment for you and baby? Another pie ce to consider is how you'll keep yourself comfortable if you get hot and then cold and then hot again? If you're very pi cky about cleanliness, what are some things you might bring a long to make you feel more at ease? If you turn to Session 4, page 5 in your Journal, t here are lines to fill in your first thoughts about what you want and don't want around you as you're moving through the process of labor. Keep in mind what you want may change over time. Flipping forward to page 8, there's an option for t hose of you who like drawn your vision of what your ideal birth setting would look like. Let's take a few minutes to think about all this. Then we'll open it up for those who'd like to share their thoughts. POSITIONS FOR LABOR AND DELIVERY (S PACE AND TIME ) The position that you're in for labor and delivery can also make a difference for you and baby. A classic study from t he late 1970's showed that women who were upright in a semi-sittin g position had 1/3 shorter first stages of labor, reported les s pain, and had infants that were less likely to have \"molded\" head s after delivery. If you think about it, if you're trying to push som ething down and out of you, why wouldn't you want to be in a po sition where gravity can help? In reality, kneeling or squatting can make a big di fference. For example, if you begin labor with the baby's back to wards your EEEEOptional Group Discussion Comparison of Technocratic & Holistic Models of Birth Excerpted from the Association of Labor Assistants and Childbirth Educators (ALACE) Technocratic Model The body is imperfect and separate from the self. Life is controllable. The self should control the body. The pregnant body is a container for the fetus, who is a separate being. Pregnancy is out-of-control and therefore unpleasant. Fetal growth is a mechanical process in which the mother is not actively involved. Birth is a mechanical process. Medical knowledge is authoritative. To be strong and powerful one must be in control. Holistic Model Self and body are one. Life is not controllable. The body cannot be controlled. Pregnancy is uncontrollable and pleasurable. Mother and baby are essentially one, they form part of an integrated system that can only be hurt by cutting it into parts. Birth is hard work a woman does. Intuition/inner knowing are authoritative. Strength and power come from letting go of control. 43 back, something that will cause you more pain, simp ly being on your hands and knees for a while can help the baby spin around to a position easier for both of you. That's much less likely to happen if y ou're lying on your back unable to move. Although many of you will either go to a childbirth education class or have given birth before, I thought we could briefly look at some alternative positions for labor. /checkbld http://www.babycenter.com/0_positions-for-labor-and -birth_10309507.bc (Positions to ease labor pain. Note: this is sponso red by Pampers). What are your thoughts on seeing these alternative positions? For those of you who have given birth before, which positions did you use? How did that change as your labor progressed? Thank you for sharing your thoughts on these positi ons and some of your birth experiences. So one of the things for you to think about in your birth plan is how much you'd like to be able to walk arou nd and change positions. If you'd like to do that, you'll need to make choices about things that can tie you down, like electronic fetal monito rs, IV fluids, and of course medications or an epidural. If you turn to Session 4, page 6 in your Journal, y ou'll see a place for you to write down your wishes about being able to move around during the labor process and for you to consider how medicatio ns or IV's might impact your ability to labor the way that you want to or affect your baby. CARING FOR YOURSELF THROUGH LABOR (R ESOURCES ) One aspect of the labor process that many moms don' t consider is that, especially with first births, it can take a long ti me and it can become tiresome without proper food and drink. For those o f you who've gone through it before, what are your experiences with b eing hungry or thirsty, or maybe being too nauseated to even think of eatin g? What are your experiences with hospital policies ab out eating and drinking after your admitted? What are your thoughts on this ? On page 7 of Session 4 in your Journal, you can put down what you'd like to eat and drink as you progress through labor and if you haven't done so, E E 44 you might want to find out your doctor's feelings a nd this and what's typical where you're going to deliver. ROLE PLAY : DEFENDING YOUR HEALTHY HABITAT (C OMPETITION ) Now we've talked about the important components for building a natural and healthy habitat and the trade offs that come wi th each part of the birthing process, I thought we might practice how t o respond to a number of things that might come along and disturb the hab itat you've built. I'll have each one of you read a statement that you migh t hear after the birth, and the rest of us will think about how that might disturb your environment and what alternative you might offer. (Feel free to add any scenarios that you've frequently encountered to wha t is already listed). \"I think your baby looks jaundiced, you need to sta rt giving him 2 ounces of formula every couple of hours.\" \"Your baby seems a little shaky. She probably has l ow blood sugar. We should boost her up with some formula.\" \"It's been ten hours and I don't see any milk comin g out of your breasts. I think we need to supplement him until yo u get your milk in.\" \"You look a little groggy from the medication, why don't I take her to the nursery for a little while so you can rest up?\" \"There's no way you're going to have enough milk to feed both babies. You better give them some formula if you don't want them to starve!\" \"Let's place your baby in the bassinet in the corne r of the room and give her a pacifier so she won't bother you with he r crying.\" \"I don't think it's safe for you to breastfeed with the medications you had during the cesarean.\" \"You're at 37 weeks now, why don't we just go ahead and induce you and get that baby out.\" \"She'll keep her temperature a lot more stable if s he's under the warmer instead of lying with you.\" Statements How it might disturb Alternatives 45 \"You need to be holding him in the cradle or cross cradle hold. I don't think you're doing it right.\" \"We need to just keep trying to push her onto the b reast even though she's crying and turning away.\" \"If you're having a hard time getting her latched o n why don't I give you a nipple shield and that will make it better?\" Wow! You had some great ideas on what to say in res ponse to things that might challenge your ability to bond with your baby and get breastfeeding going. I wanted to give you a minute to fill in the question on the bottom of page 7, to consider other things that might inte rfere with your plans and how you might deal with those as well. SIGNS WE CAN USE TO SEE IF THINGS ARE GOING WELL (P ROTEST -DESPAIR BEHAVIOR ) How do babies let us know that separating them from their mothers is not what they need? (pause briefly to see if someone re sponds) Actually neuroscientists call the response that inf ants give when separated from their mothers the protest-despair behavior . During the protest phase, the infant will intensely try to seek their mother and then begin crying. In fact, separated infants make 10 times more crying s ignals than a baby held skin-to-skin. And this isn't just any regular cry, as the baby is really letting you know it is in distress. After a while if the ba by remains separated he'll go into the despair phase. The baby will stop cryin g and show signs of withdrawal. Some researchers compare this to what w e see as the signs of depression in adults. So I would ask the group, even though the baby has stopped crying what sort of things do you think are going on inside its body? You're right the baby is not doing well. In fact, t he baby in the despair phase has very high levels of stress hormones and a lower heart rate and temperature. This is not the way you want a fragile newborn to be. Show short clip from Nils Bergman Kangaroo Care vid eo highlighting temperature, respiration, and heart beat difference between nursery and kangaroo care infants. (Search YouTube.com for \"Nil s Bergman on Social and Emotional Intelligence\") What are some of your thoughts after watching that clip? E /movies 46 BREASTFEEDING -MORE THAN DELIVERING NUTRITION (R ESOURCES ) Since we're thinking about how important it is for mom to be baby's first habitat, I wanted to share something with you about the power of breast milk. I know we've already spent time talking about all its nutritional qualities, how much it differs from formula, how it sets up your baby's gut and immune system and so much more. But there's another secret about breast milk that I've been holding off on sharing until today. Believe it or not, we k now from studies in newborn rats that mothers' milk is an important reg ulator of heart rate. This isn't just because the baby rat's stomach feel s full or because of the basic nutrients in the milk. It's actually because certain components of mothers' milk have an effect on cells in the lining of the stomach that are connected to the brain. And that part of the brain helps regulate heart rate. So we can see that babies who have skin-to-skin con tact for an hour after birth have more stable skin temperatures, more norm al heart rates and blood pressures, higher blood sugars, are less like ly to cry, and more likely to breastfeed well than those who are separated. W e'll talk a bit more at our celebration next month about how using the SOFT approach to welcoming your baby into the world can help make su re this happens. In anticipation I thought our last activity would b e turning to Session 4, page 9 of our Journal and imagining what our babies will be thinking the minute they're born and what we can do to help them make that big transition. CLASS WRAP UP/I NCENTIVE ITEM /P LUG NEXT CLASS Today we've talked about a number of things that ca n make a more welcoming place for you to meet and bond with your baby. I'd invite you to keep thinking about how you'd like to build your special habitat and who you'll need to communicate your plans with. The re are a number of good birth plan worksheets available. One you might visit is on Baby Center.com (or can use any birth plan you particula rly like) /checkbld http://assets.babycenter.com/ims/Content/birthplan_ pdf.pdf A gift that we have for everyone is the Labor Lab b ooklet (or other resource that outlines alternatives for labor). It gives a lot of ideas on how to deal with common issues in labor and gives you b aby friendly alternatives. Hofer, M. Psychobiological Roots of Early Attachment. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 2006.15;2: 84-88. E 47 Before we go I'd like to tell you about the party w e'll be having in our next session. Not only will we celebrate how much we've learned together but we'll go over what to expect in those first few wee ks with your baby. Plus we'll have time to go over last minute questions, c oncerns, and hopes. As always, I'd like to thank each of you for attend ing and I can't wait to party with all of you next month! The 12-page Labor Lab Booklet is available for $2.50 per book from Noodle Soup. #1660 www.noodlesoup.com/l aborlabbooklet.aspx 48 Group Session Five THE PRE-PARTY BEFORE THE BIG EVENT GROUP DESCRIPTION : The Big Event is only a month away; time to celebrate. In this pre-party you are the guest of honor. Take advantage of one more chance to mix and mingle with your friends fro m your group while enjoying snacks and learning about what to expect w ith your newborn. AUDIENCE : Women in the 8th month of pregnancy. OBJECTIVES : 1. Celebrate how far we've come in our pregnancies and how much we've learned as a group. 2. Apply the SOFT approach for welcoming our baby to t he world. 3. Help make the first hour with your baby a magical h our. 4. Address any remaining questions or concerns. Section 6 49 NOTE TO FACILITATORS : The fifth and final session really is a celebration and therefore is meant to be customized to the interests, needs, and dynamics of each of your groups. As such, the fifth session differs from those which came before it in that there is no precise script to follow. Although spe cific objectives are listed for the session, what follows is a list of optional activities that you can include in your session. However, depending on the enthusiasm of your group, very little content may need to be introduce d to have the session be a success. In addition, having a flexible final ses sion better accommodates inclusion of a few participants with early births a nd gets participants acquainted with the more open format they'll experi ence in the postpartum groups. As with every session, make it your own an d have fun with it! You have a LOT to celebrate WELCOME Good morning/afternoon and welcome to your party! I can see that some of you have brought guests, and I'd like the chance for everyone to get to know each other. And I see a couple of you have ver y special, little guests as well! (if any participants have already had thei r baby). If it is alright with you, I'd like everyone to say their first name and either what they're most looking forward to with the birth or what surprised you the most about the birth you just had (and of course introduce any babies). LINKING PRIOR SESSIONS TO THIS SESSION Thank you for introducing yourselves and sharing wh at you're most looking forward to with the upcoming birth. We've talked ab out so many things during our time together. What are some things that you remember the most? What sticks out in your mind? (Open for sharing) Wow! You've remembered a lot! Fantastic! As you rec alled, we ended our last session together planning for the hospital experien ce. I'd like to follow up on that idea today. But first, I'd like to ask whether there's anything else you'd like to be sure that we talk about today? I also ha ve some topics left over from our 'stroller parking lot', and I'd like to know wh ich ones you'd like to cover today as well? (Open for questions or stroller park ing topics). /quotedbllftbld /conference 50 ACTIVITY OPTION ONE : SOFT APPROACH TO WELCOMING YOUR BABY Going back to our last session, where we talked abo ut labor and delivery issues, we also went over the importance of helping your baby make a comfortable transition from the womb to the outside world. To help make those first days more successful, labor and deliver y staff from hospitals all over Oregon have started to receive training on the SOFT approach to helping mothers and babies bond after birth. Who wo uld like to guess what each letter of SOFT might stand for? Great guesses. Should I give you some visual hints? (provide corresponding graphics) S= Skin to Skin: infant is naked on mother's naked c hest and there is no bedding or clothing between them for a minimum of 1 5 minutes during the first two hours of life. O= Open Eye to Open Eye: Both mother and Infant have eyes open and are making eye contact with each other at a distanc e no great than 12 inches. Mother is watching baby and baby is watchin g mother. F= Fingertip Touch: Mother explores infant with her fingertips, spontaneously and without interruption. Baby has ha nds free to help explore mother's body and find the breast. T= Time Together: Mother is given time to hold her u nwrapped infant in an unhurried and uninterrupted environment for an u nlimited period of time. During this time, no painful procedures are b eing done to the mother or baby. What sounds good to you about the SOFT approach? Wh at concerns do you have about it? How do you see it fitting in wit h your hospital experience? ACTIVITY OPTION TWO : THE MAGICAL HOUR VIDEO Keeping with our thoughts about the hours immediate ly after your baby is born, I'd like to show you a short video called the Magical Hour. Research shows that when held skin-to-skin, every baby goes through nine specific stages transitioning from the birth cry, to activit y, to eventually finding the breasts, and then sleep. Using the SOFT approach we just discussed helps assure that moms and babies are able to take the ti me to go through these steps, which give a big boosts to baby's physical a nd psychological well being. Let's take a look at the video. 51 What are some of your thoughts after watching this? How do you see the magical hour fitting in with your birth plan? ACTIVITY OPTION THREE : WRITE THE PARTY INVITATION FOR YOUR BABY Before we move on to our celebration, I thought we might do one last writing activity in our journals. The name of this session is the Pre-Party Before the Big Event, and of course that big event is.....(open for a nswer). So with that in mind, I thought we should write an invitation to th e guest of honor, and we have a premade invite to do just that on page 4 of your journals. Now this invitation isn't meant to be literal, so when you'r e filling out things like desired attire, and what food will be served, think about w hat we've talked about in our sessions together, and what you want your baby to look forward to. I'll give you some time to fill these out. Would anyone like to share part of their invitation ? ACTIVITY OPTION FOUR : PREVIEW OF NEWBORN POOPS As we transition into our party and having snacks, we've set up a few things around the room to help get acquainted with what comes with a normal newborn. One thing to familiarize yourselves with is how the diapers will look. We've set up a sample over here. (Can do other newborn \"normal\" demos as desired). NON -OPTIONAL ACTIVITY : SNACK , PARTY AND MINGLE ! No scripting needed here, just have fun. If you'd l ike to incorporate the newborn 'what's normal' demos, you might interspers e those with the snacks. You might also enjoy taking photos of the g roup. This is a great time for reinforcing the bonds that will make moms want to notify after the baby's born and ask for help if needed. WRAP UP AND INVITE TO POSTPARTUM SESSION I hate to break up our party, but I need to bring o ur time together today to a close. I want to thank each and every one of you for being a part of our group and taking the time to learn with and from ea ch other. I wish you all the best for your upcoming birth and know that (the PC's) and I would love to hear as soon as possible that your baby has arrived. If you haven't done so, please go ahead and put our contact number s (email or texts) into your cell phone. The sooner you let us know that yo u've started breastfeeding, or even if it's not going quite like you thought, the sooner we can help you make your breastfeeding wishes come true. E Homemade Dirty Diaper Recipe 1 teaspoon (or 2 packets) yellow mustard 2 teaspoons sesame seeds 1 tablespoon cottage cheese 1 empty baby food jar Put ingredients in the jar, fill jar to the top with water, put the top on and swirl to mix. 52 You might be wondering when we'll all get back toge ther again as a group? The PC's will follow up with you individually after birth, and then at about 1 month we'll have our first group session so you can meet each other's babies and talk about how the birth went. W e'll keep in contact with you in the weeks that follow and bring everyon e together again when the babies are 2 and 3 months old. At the session w e'll vote on the topics that group wants to cover that day, plus we'll shar e important development tips for your baby's age and stage. We'll also chec k back in on how things are going with our relationships and how well we're able to take care of ourselves. Overall the goal is to have fun, support each other, and have an open environment where we can talk about anything t hat comes up for new parents. I can't wait to see you there and to g et to meet your new babies for the first time! 53 Appendix HANDOUTS FOR ACTIVITIES A. Who's Glad You're Breastfeeding - Option 1 B.

How to Know a Health Professional is not Supportive of Breastfeeding All health professionals say they are supportive of breastfeeding. But many are supportive only when breastfeeding is going well, and some, not even then. As soon as breastfeeding, or anything in the life of the new mother is not perfect, too many advise weaning or supplementation. The following is a partial list of clues that help you judge whether the health professional is supportive of breastfeeding, at least supportive enough so that if there is trouble, s/he will make efforts to help you continue breastfeeding. How to know a health professional is not supportive: 1. S/he gives you formula samples or formula company literature when you are pregnant, or after you have had the baby. These samples and literature are inducements to use the product, and their distributi on is called marketing. There is no evidence that any particular formula is better or worse than any other for the normal baby. The literature, CD's or videos accompanying samples are a means of subtly and not so subtly undermining breastfeeding and glorifying formula. If you do not believe this, ask yourself why the formula companies are using cutthroat tactics to make sure that your doctor or hospital gives out their literature and samples and not ot her companies'? Should you not also wonder why the health professional is not marketing breastfeeding? 2. S/he tells you that breastfeeding and bo ttle feeding are essentially the same. Most bottle fed babies grow up healthy and secure and not all breastfed babies grow up hea lthy and secure. But this doe s not mean that breastfeeding and bottle feeding are essentially the same. In fant formula is a rough copy of what we knew several years ago about breastmilk which is in itself only a rough approximation of something we are only beginning to get an inkling of and are constantly being surprised by. The differences have impor tant health consequences. Certain elements in breastmilk are not in artificial baby milk (formula) even though we ha ve known of their importance to the baby for several years\u2014 for example, antibodies and cells for protection of the baby against infection, and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids for optimal development of the baby's vision and brain. And breastfeeding is not the same as bottle feeding, it is a whole different relationship. If you have been unable to breastfeed, that is unfortunate (though most times the problems could have been avoided), but to imply it is of no importance is patronizing and just plain wrong. A baby does not have to be breastfed to grow up happy, healthy and secure, but it does help. 3. S/he tells you that formula x is best. This usually means that s/he is listening too much to a particular formula representative. It may mean that her/his children tolerated this particular formula better than other formulas. It means that s/he has unsubstantiated prejudices. 4. S/he tells you that it is not necessary to feed the baby immediately after the birt h since you are (will be) tired and the baby is often not interested anyhow. It isn't necessary , but it is very helpful. Babies can nurse while the mother is lying down or sleeping, though most mothers do not want to sleep at a moment such as this. Babies do not always show an interest in feeding immediately, but this is not a reason to prevent them from having the opportunity. Many babies latch on in the hour or two after delivery, and th is is the time that is most conducive to getting started well, but they can't do it if they are separated from their mothers. If you are getting the impression that the baby's getting weighed, eye drops and vitamin K injection have prior ity over establishing breastfeeding, you might wonder about someone's commitment to breastfeeding. 5. S/he tells you that there is no such thing as nipple confusion and you should start giving bottles early to your baby to make sure that the baby accepts a bottle nipple. Why do you have to start giving bottles early if there is no such thing as nipple confusion? Arguing that there is no evidence for the existence of nipple confusion is putting the cart before the horse. It is the artificial nipple, which no mammal until man had ever used, and even man, not commonly before the end of the nineteenth century, which needs to be shown to be harmless. But the artificial nipple has not been proved harmless to breastfeeding. The health professional who assumes the artificial nipple is harmless is looking at the world as if bottle feeding, not breastfeeding, were the normal physi ologic method of infa nt feeding. By the way, just because not all, or perhaps even not most, babies who ge t artificial nipples have trouble with breastfeeding, it does not follow that the early use of these things cannot cause problems for some babies. It is often a combination of factors, one of which could be the using of an artificial nipple, which add up to trouble. 6. S/he tells you that you must stop breastfeeding because you or your baby is sick, or because you will be taking medicine or you will have a medical test done. There are occasional, rare, situ ations when breastfeeding cannot continue, but often heal th professi onals only assum e that the mother cannot cont inue and oft en they are wrong. The health professi onal who is supportive of breastfeeding will m ake efforts to find out how to avoid interruption of breastfeeding (the inform ation in white pages of the blue Com pendium of Pharm aceutical Specialties is not a good reference\u2014every drug is contraindicated acco rding to it as the drug com panies are m ore interested in their liability than in the interests o f mothers a nd babies). W hen a m other must take medicine, the health professio nal will try to use medication that does not requi re the mother to stop breast feeding. (In fact , very few medications requi re the mother to stop breast feeding). It is extremely uncom mon for t here to be onl y one m edication that can be used for a part icular probl em. If t he first choi ce of t he heal th professi onal is a medication that requi res y ou to stop breast feeding, y ou have a right to be concerned t hat s/he has not really thought about the importance of breast feeding. 7. S/he is surprised to learn that your 6 month old is still breastfeeding. Many heal th professi onals believe that babies shoul d be cont inued on art ificial baby milk for at least nine months and even t welve m onths, but at the sam e time seem to believe that breast milk and breast feeding are unnecessary and even harm ful if cont inued l onger t han six months. W hy is the imitation bet ter than the original? Shoul dn't you wonder what this line of reasoni ng implies? In most of the worl d, breast feeding to 2 or 3 y ears of age i s com mon and norm al. 8. S/he tells you that there breastmilk has no nutrition al value after the baby is 6 months or older. Even if it were true, there is still v alue in breastfeeding . Breastfeeding is a uni que i nteraction bet ween t wo peopl e in love even wi thout the milk. Bu t it is not true. Breastm ilk is still m ilk, with fat, protein, calories, vitam ins and the rest, and the antibodies and other elem ents which protect the baby against infectio ns are still th ere, so me in greater q uantities th an when the baby was y ounger. Any one who t ells you this doesn't know t he first thing about breast feeding. 9. S/he tel ls you that you must never allow your baby to fall asleep at the breast. Why not? It is fine if a baby can also fall asleep without nursing, but one of the advantages of breastfeeding is that you have a handy way of putting your tired baby to sleep. Mothers around the world since the begi nning of m ammalian time have done just that. One of t he great pleasures of parent hood i s havi ng a chi ld fall asleep in your arm s, feel ing the warm th he gi ves off as sl eep overcom es hi m. It is one of t he pleasures of breast feeding, bot h for t he mother and probabl y also for the baby , when the baby falls asleep at the breast. 10. S/he tel ls you that you shoul d not stay i n hospi tal to nurse your si ck chi ld because i t is important you rest at home. It is im portant you rest, and the hosp ital that is supportive of breastfeeding will arrange it so that you can rest while you stay in the hospi tal to nurse y our baby . Sick babi es do not need breast feeding less than a healthy baby, they need it more. 11. S/he does not try to get you help if you are having trouble with breastfeeding. Most probl ems can be cured, and m ost of t he time the answer t o breast feeding probl ems is not giving form ula. Unfort unately, many health professi onals, particularly physicians, and even mo re particularly paediatricians , do not know how t o help. But there is help out there. Insi st on get ting it. \"You don't have t o breast feed to be a good mother\", is true, but not an answer to a breast feeding probl em. Questions ?

Criticism - Attacking your partner's personality by pointing out his or her defects. (Example - you're lazy, you're a slob, \"you never\", \"you always\") 2. Defensiveness - Is what we do when we feel criticized. Either by: 1) attacking back, 2) proclaiming our innocence, 3) whining like a victim, or 4) act ing put-out and resentful. 3. Contempt - using insults that focus on how we're superior. This can take the form of, yelling out insults, rolling our eyes, calling each other bad n ames, talking down to our partner. 4. Stonewalling - When we don't like what our partner is saying, w e become like a stone wall and give no response at all. Alternative Approaches - ways to talk to your partner that don't involve the four behaviors above: Instead of criticism, we can make a complaint by st ating our feelings and describe the situation neutrally. Instead of defensiveness, we can openly acknowledge our part in messing things up. Instead of contempt, we can find small ways every d ay to show each other that we care and respect one another. When admiration and fondness are expre ssed, they go a long way to create a culture of appreciation in our homes. When we feel ourselves starting to stonewall, and f eel too overwhelmed; take a break, calm down, and come back to our partner within a reasonable amount of time (it can take 20 minutes or more to get the body to completely calm down). Other helpful t ips: Create a signal to let your partner know you need to take a break. Let our partner know that we hear them, even if by only nodding our head or gazing into their eyes. Focusing on breathing when we begin to get upset can help. Opening the Conversation John Gottman noticed that the way a conflict conver sation goes is determined by how it starts 96% of t he time. The couples who master the transition to parenthood follow these three steps when bringing up an issue : 1. Say what you feel. 2. Describe the problem neutrally, with no blame. 3. Say what you need (not what you don't need). "}
