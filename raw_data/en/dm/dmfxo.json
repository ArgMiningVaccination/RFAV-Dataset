It is a combination of modern science and an understanding of the body's natural healing properties. Functional Medicine Functional Medicine addresses underlying root causes to your symptoms and establishes the relationships and patterns between them, including interactions between you and your environment, your lifestyle and dietary choices, your genetics, and much more.
