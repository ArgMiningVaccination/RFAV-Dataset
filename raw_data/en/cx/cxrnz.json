In her own foreword to the German edition, she wrote: \"Since 1925. when Rudolf Steiner left the physical plane, a whole new generation has grown up. Many of his rst pupils, who were able to work with him and under his eyes in the various elds of anthroposophical activity, are no longer with us. The newcomers have been rightly anxious that a human picture of the great teacher should be called to life from the individual memories and ex periences of those who knew him, and we are grateful for all the books which have tried to do this and have been published in the comrse of years. \"The essential aim of the present collection has been to bring together pupils of Dr. Steiner from the widest possible range of callings who have not yet recorded their recoUections of him, andhave played an active part in carrying forward the impulse he gave for the renewal of culture and civilisation. Their personal memories are set down here in contributions which follow no xed pattern and are intended to be no more than sketches, for the com prehensive picture, which the younger generation asks for, is some thing that no single person ever saw.\" For us, the English editors, it remains only to express our gratitude to all the friends who undertook the exacting work of translation. Our thanks are due also to the German publishers and the German contributors for their ready assent to the project, and to the contributors with command of English for their help in revising certain chapters. By issuing the English volume in this form, in place of an ordinary Golden Blade, we are able to offer it at a considerablylower price than would have been possible otherwise. We hope to resume normal publication of the Golden Blade next year. November, 1957,A. F. C W .RUDOLF STEINER IN ENGLAND George Adams The spiritual life of England and the English-speaking worldplayed an important part in Rudolf Steiner's life-work. Thiswas a natural outcome of his allotted task in relation to the Spirit of the Time. For in the phase of history beginning in the 15th centmy A.D. Qcnown as the Fifth post-Atlantean Epoch) the Celtic, Anglo-Saxon and Germanic peoples became the bearers of the forward trend in human evolution, even as the Greek and Latin peoples had been in the preceding epoch. The spiritual gifts ofthese more Northern peoples are revealed in two more or less complementary directions, nding their characteristic expressionhitherto where the English and the German languages are spoken. Precisely inasmuch as he was so deeply rooted in the cultural heritage of the German-speaking people among whom he was bom, and in particular of his Austrian homeland, Rudolf Steiner's world wide mission stood in the midst of this polarity. Thus in the very rst of his philosophic works, his introductions to the scientic writings of Goethe, he enters into the conscious and unconscious wrestlings of the great German poet with the world-outlook which through the English scientists and thinkers\u2014^Bacon, Newton and Locke before Goethe's time and Darwin shortly after\u2014has so greatly influenced the modem world. Yet in an even wider compass, far beyond theoretical and scientic questions, Rudolf Steiner had a deep inner connection with the spiritual sources that underlie the native trend of English life and thought. Among his closest friends during his early years in Vienna were men and women such as Friedrich Eckstein and Marie Lang, who throughout their lives were in close contact with the English-speaking world and drew many of their leading inspira tions from it. Indeed, it was in those early years that the founda tions were laid for the decisive step he was to take fteen years later, when to the utter amazement of the scholarly and literary circles among whom he lived and moved in Berlin, he suddenly became a leading gure in the Theosophical Society. Nourished though it was to a large extent from Oriental sources, the Theo sophical Society derived its character from the mental outlook and spiritual aspirations of the American and English people among whom it was founded. In his Autobiography Dr. Steiner relates how among the English-speaking members of this Society, though he himself could not have worked in their style, he found \"a spiritual focus from which one could worthily take one's st^ if one was deeply and tmly concemed for the spread of spiritual knowledge.\" And in a lecture where he gives an outline of hisearly life, he tells how in Vienna in the 1880's he was among therst to acquire and pass on to others the booklet which became one ,, of the classics of the theosophical movement. Light on the Path ^ written down by Mabel Collins. In Rudolf Steiner's open heart and comprehensive mind every shade of the spiritual wrestlings of his time was Uving fs clear- thinking and yet heartfelt participation in all contemporary trendscame to life agam in his personal relation to his pupils, who found their way to him from every conceivable direction in the manifoldand often contradictory Ufe of our time. He would encourage every one of us along his chosen path, no matter how great the seeming contradictions in the advices he gave to one individual oranother. Each of us therefore will have amazingly diverse thinggto relate from our intercourse with him. This aspect of his being ^ too\u2014reflected however imperfectly in those who became his pupik \u2014reveals the true picture of mankind in modem time I mean not only what we have to tell about him. but what we ourselves became, quickened by our encounter with him. The picture of Man for which the present age, through all mistakes and failings is sincerely striving is made manifest in the way Rudolf Steiner entered into the inmost ideals and individual destinies of every one of his disciples. * I write these words because the purpose of this book is that those who knew Rudolf Steiner in earthly life should tell of their experiences with him. Many among his English friends who mayhave known him better than I did, and would have had quite other things to relate, have followed him into the spiritual world. I for my part, to tell especially of my rst meeting with him. must relate ft some of the circumstances which led up to this. Like Rudolf Steiner himself. I was bom. though not of Slavonic blood, in the SlavonicEast of Europe. I think I owe to this the mobility in point of language which enabled me as a young man to become his interpreter. The speaking and hearing of several languages side by I side is or at least was at that time\u2014^part of the social structure of those countries on the Eastern fringe of Middle Europe; it belongs to the very air one breathes, the etheric atmosphere of the land scape. My father, bom in Australia of German and English immi grants. had come back to Europe shortly before my birth and was among the pioneers\u2014mostly Irish Canadians and Poles in those early years\u2014of the oil industry in the Carpathian foothills wherewe lived. It was a part of Poland (now incorporated in Soviet Russia as the \"Westem Ukraine\") belonging still at that time to the old Hapsburg monarchy; therefore I also felt the touch, though in a far outlying province, of the pervasive and rather fascinating i qualities of Rudolf Steiner's Austrian home country. My own mother-tongue was English, and so was my upbringing. I hadBritish citizenship by virtue of my father's birthplace. iiAt the outbreak of the rst World War I was an undergraduate at Cambridge. That was the moment when I rst heard of Rudolf Steiner. During an unforgettable holiday at a lonely spot on the Suffolk coast I read right through his Outline of Occult Science. The book impressed me deeply. Unlike some other theosophical works, it made no attempt to come to terms with scientic orthodoxy, but the author did at every point state clearly and in a scientic spirit the ground on which he stood. You knew where you were; you felt the writer understood and shared the scientic outlook. As to its spiritual content\u2014^it was the English edition, with that impressive portrait where he is sitting with his hands haff-folded looking straight at you and yet far beyond\u2014^it made a \"timeless\" impression on me. I cannot remember thinking. \"When did the author live, or is he living now?\" Despite the modem style and context, he seemed to writ^from beyond all special times. In the summer of 191or^ined the \"Emerson Group\" of &e Anthroposophical Society in London. The meetings began with the verse. \" From the luminous heights of the Spirit . . .\". specially given by Dr. Steiner for this Group to its leader. Mrs. Cull, when itwas founded a year or two before the War. She was a wise Scottish lady, daughter of Principal Tulloch of St. Andrews. In the mountains of Ceylon, before she met Rudolf Steiner. she made some acquaintance with Buddhist esotericism; she told me of the in describable spiritual presence which she felt when she heard Rudolf Steiner in his lecture-cycles speaking of the Buddha. To me as one of mixed descent (my father's father was German, my other three grandparents English) the War became a personal problem in a special sense. In my subjective feelings, however, mymixed descent played little part or none at all. I was full of belief in the oneness and peaceful progress of mankind\u2014^an idealism, no doubt, far too easy, but sincere. It was a time when the traditions of 19th-century liberalism were still living. Lord Morley and others, believing the outbreak of war to have been avoidable, had resigned from the Asquith Government. Bodies were formed, such as the \"Union of Democratic Control\", with the resolve that the methods of international intercourse sho^d be so changed as to prevent the future occurrence of such catastrophes over the heads, as we thought, of the common people of either country. I myself naturally gravitated towards pacist and social- revolutionary movements, and was among those who refused mili tary service. I mention Aese things because of the part they wereto play in my rst conversations with Dr. Steiner. At Cambridge I made the acquaintance of the family of Josiah Wedgwood, M.P. He, and also Mrs. Wedgwood (Ethel Bowen- Wedgwood\u2014they were already separated at that time), received mewith great kindness. Commander Wedgwood, as he then was. had been severely wounded in the Gallipoli campaign. He was an active member of the House of Commons, believing the War to be 3inevitable, yet not withholding sympathy and help from those who thought otherwise. He was the soul of chivalty and had a deepand real belief in freedom. Like one of Rudolf Steiner's closest friends in Berlin in the 1890's, the Scottish-German poet John Henry Mackay, the Wedgwoods\u2014phUosophic anarchist rather thansocialist in outlook\u2014were followers of Henry George; they had some contact too with the T olstoyan movement T owards the end of the War, while I was her guest Mrs. Wedgwood heard of Rudolf Steiner's work through me. She read with deep interest his lectures on the Apocalypse, in which the spiritual-scientic conception of human history and evolution is set forth. Then in the spring of 1919 came his newly written book on the Threefold Social Order Mrs. Wedgwood had always taken an active part in public life In her girlhood she had known the aged Gladstone, a personal friend of her father's. Her lifelong interest and belief in a renewal of the body politic in the true human spirit of the time was quickenedand enhanced by the terrible events of the War, to which her generous nature responded with intense human sympathy and with indignation against any falsehood or injustice. With all the enthusiasm of her choleric temperament, she now entered into the solution which emerged from Dr. Steiner's masterly analysis, in which all her experience appeared conrmed and her ideals realised, not with Utopian proposals, but with a practicable and progressive path to their fullment. We wrote to Rudolf Steiner: it was important that this book should quicUy be made available to English readers. We offered to translate it. In his reply Dr. Steiner put us into touch with the sculptress Edith Maryon, who was helping him with the Goetheanum building ^d above all with the great wooden sculptured Group\u2014^the Christlike gure of the \"Representative of Humanity\" between adversary powers, Lucifer and Ahriman\u2014^which was to occupy thecentral position between the pillars at the eastern end of the com pleted building. Miss Maryon throughout those years was one of his closest collaborators in other respects too, for the studio inwhich the work was going on became his study for a great part ofthe day; here he received his visitors and she was acting very largely as his secretary. Now he himself had been anxious for an English edition of the book, and as no one else was at hand. Miss Maryon had undertaken to translate it. She, too, now wrote to usand eventually sent us her draft. In style, however\u2014like many of the attempted translations of Dr . Steiner's works in those early days\u2014it was impossible, certainly for a work that was to reach awider public, and we said so frankly. We were then invited to Domach to go into the whole question. Late in September, 1919, we arrived there. Dr. Steiner was away in Stuttgart, where the rst Waldorf School had just been opened. We were received in the most friendly way by the Domachmembers and above all by Miss Maryon herself. She gave us 4mallet and chisel and let us help with parts of the scxilptured group where there was much superfluous wood and our unskilled hands coiffd do no harm. One day we were thus engaged when Rudolf Steiner suddenly appeared at Miss Maryon's side, up the steep steps of the scaffolding. He was very simple, courteous, friendly\u2014and happy. That was my very first impression\u2014his delight in telling of the school and of the children. These are the rst words that have stayed in my mind: Die Kinder toben\u2014the children are romping is never rampageous won't grow up into a capable man or woman. (An approximate trans lation! The word toblustig, I am told, is in no orthodox voca bulary. That too is characteristic.) I thought a little ruefully of my own rather subdued and melancholic childhood. My impression even in those rst few days was, so to speak, of many Rudolf Steiners. There was the simple, friendly gentlemanwhom we had seen at this rst meeting. Then there was Dr. Steiner lecturing\u2014deeply impressive and stem, vivid in characterisation,then often moving into anecdote, good-natured satire, rollicking fun and humour. And there was Dr. Steiner speaking in a more esoteric meeting\u2014more as you see him in that portrait in the old editions of Occult Science\u2014the Initiate from timeless realms. Moreover, there was Dr. Steiner as you might see him during a personal interview, when you told him of your life's difculties and ideals and he answered your questions\u2014the deep, silent look in his eyes, the warm kindness and encouragement at some moments, andat others the absolute quiet, so that it was left entirely to you to come out with what you had to say, with seemingly no help from him, but silent waiting. And then again there was Dr. Steiner as I saw him at the large public gatherings in Germany in 1921-22, often with audiences of two or three thousand, partly indifferent or merely curious or even hostile\u2014^the way he held them, the firmness and buoyancy of his carriage, the utter lack of compromise or any attempt to influence them. He rather put them through the mill, building up the ground of spiritual science or the stages of higher cognition with closely knit trains of thought, speaking for twohours or more at a stretch and yet holding his audience completely. Mrs. Wedgwood and I saw Dr. Steiner several times during those days. We had to tell him why and how we thought Miss Maryon's translation inadequate. She herself was present, busyingherself with sundry other things. I remember when Mrs. Wedg wood, as tactfully as she could in her forthright, choleric way, had explained how impossible the translation was, I assenting. Dr. Steiner's matter-of-fact and kindly answer: \"Das ist Ihre gung\"\u2014that is your conviction. There was no pointed emphasisin the sentence, no implication for or against\u2014it was a simple statement of the fact: we start from here. Presently he asked for examples, which we began producing. \"Maryon, kommen Sie 5mal\" he called out, and he explained to her the disparities we had been pointing out Impersonal, unselsh and detached, in the end she said that she had only offered to do it because no one else was at hand; she did not really feel competent in this realm and gladly withdrew. Soon afterwards Mrs. Wedgwood's translation (for it was very largely hers\u2014I only gave incidental help) was published in London by AUen and Unwin, entitled The Threefold State. The book was well received. Mrs. Wedgwood afterwards retranslated it for a new edition, which we renamed The Threefold Commonwealth. Each of us also spoke with Dr. Steiner alone. I remember as he sat there in his studio beneath the great gure of the Christ on which he was still working, with manifold sculptures and clay models all around, there on his shelves were the books I had known so well in the war-time years in England, where the questions of the outbreak of the war and of the economic and poUtical back ground of warfare generally in the modem world were thrashed out\u2014controversial books by E. D. Morel, C. H. Norman and others. It was tj^ical of Rudolf Steiner. However deeply he might see into the supersensible background of events, he spared no pains in getting to know the precise details of outer happenings, the prevalent opinions and the thoughts of others. We naturally came to speak of my war-time experiences, and he took seriously the move ment with which I had been associated. He valued ttie fact that there were men and women who in the last resort followed their own individual conscience, and that there was a country in which one was able in this way also to play an active and fruitful part in public life. The system of separate Nation-States, each witib itscitizen or conscript army\u2014^a heritage from Napoleonic times\u2014can not go on for ever. Face to face with the appalling lethal powers which modern technical science has conjured up, Rudolf Steiner saw a time approaching when the Spirit of Mankind wiU give individuals the courage to take upon themselves far-reaching decisions, in the face of all prevailing powers and conventions. Of her conversations with him during those days, Mrs. Wedg wood told me something which reveals again how he was wont to see a question from many sides, and I will relate it, though at second-hand. It concerns his attitude during the War of 1914-18, about which a few words more may here be said, for it presented a problem to his English friends. He certainly did not see in thatWar a straightforward issue of right and wrong, brought about by aggressive military designs on the part of &e Central Powers;rather he seems to have been convinced, especially in the initial stages, that Germany and Austria were ghting in self-defence. In the Wilsonian conception that underlay the Peace Treaties of 1919 \u2014^the setting-up of many smaller Nation-States\u2014^he reco^sed a profound mistake. Let your political principles, he says in effect (in The Threefold State and other writings), guarantee the rights and liberties of man as such\u2014^individual man\u2014and the freedom ofnationalities will follow; it cannot be achieved the other way about He saw the War in a far deeper and wider context; to quote the title of one of his war-time lecture-cycles, it was the inexorable \"Karma of Materialism\". He composed meditations addressed to the Guardian Angels of those who were at the front or had been killed, and to the Souls of the Nations\u2014^the Archangel-beings \"in the choirs of the spheres of peace \". Of such a kind that they could equally well be used in all the warring countries, these meditations quickly reached us through friends in Switzerland and elsewhere. They were translated\u2014more easily perhaps than some of his otherverses\u2014and in the anthroposophical groups one heard them regularly. During those years Dr . Steiner spoke again and again about the Spirit of the Time and the Souls of Nations. Some of his deepestand most loving characterisations of the English, French and Russian peoples were given in his lectures at Berlin and Dornach a few weeks after the War had broken out, and in the years that followed. His own people he kept calling to their true spiritual task, exposing the perilous sources of illusion which were unhappily to prevail not many years after his death. Mrs. Wedgwood, ardent in her wish for truer international relations, had been resisting the one-sided and often extravagant war-propaganda of her own country , and at that moment she wasincensed by the harsh provisions of the Versailles Treaty. Rudolf Steiner's answer was to temper her indignation. Yet after all, he said in effect, perhaps it is as well that victory was not on the other side. And he went on, thinking no doubt of Ludendorff and others like him: We have to bear in mind the kind of militarist mentality which gained control in Germany towards the end of the War. These people would not have treated a defeated enemy with magnanimity or made a wise peace-settlement in the true interests of human progress. I asked Dr. Steiner for his spiritual guidance and he gave me a fresh appointment. When I came again a few days later he had written out for me an evening and a morning meditation, based on the opening words of St. John's Gospel. He explained in detail how it should be done, and then continued: This is only half of what is necessary. The other half is, you must be aware that the regular doing of your meditation is the one entirely free deed ofthe day . However much the other things you do spring from your own resolves, the circumstances that lead up to them are determned by your particular destiny in this present life. But nothing is obliging you to do the meditation; that is entirely the outcome of y o u r o w n f r e e d e c i s i o n . . .I think this, too, was typical of Rudolf Sterner. What in the spiritual schools of former times would have been a binding vow,he would translate into a deed of purest freedom. This^ meta morphosis\u2014this inversion, one might almost say\u2014^he 7ever so many ways, not always equaUy explicit; and we, his pupils, were often slow to perceive it. We thankfully received the new content of his teaching and poured it too often into old bottles of would-be piety and sheltered \"goodness\", not really true to the spirit of the time. Or else we took the new freedom too lightlyOne sometimes had the impression that this, more than anything, saddened and made him lonely. Dr. Steiner entered with great kindness into the question of my future life and career. I had ambitions in scientic research and had made a promising beginning. But as an outcome of &e War and the upheavals in which it ended, the social needs of mankind were in the foreground and I was wondering in which way to turn In answer to my question, Rudolf Steiner said: These issues are more urgent now than purely scientic work. Now at that moment I had been offered a job which would have brought me into close contact with events. During the War I had enjoyed the friendship of the distinguished journalist, Michael Farbman. A warm-hearted and highly intelligent Russian Jew, he had been working at a book in which he vainly tried so to influence Allied policy that his war- weary coimtry would not be driven, as in fact it was, into the armsof the Bolsheviks. His command of English was not perfect. I loved the Russian language and was deeply interested in all that was going on in Russia. I helped him put his work into good English. Farbman was now about to become Russian Correspondent of a leading English Daily, with his headquarters in Berlin to begin with, and wanted me to go with him as his Secretary. I toldDr. Steiner of this. Our conversation naturally turned to the Russian revolutionary leaders. \"Lenin himself,\" said Dr. Steiner,\" I hold to be an honest man and an intellect of no mean order.\" his words; I only remember the gist of what follows: What he is doing, however, is ruthlessly to exploit and destroy the old civilisation. This civilisation, it is true, is inexorably dying out; be under no illusions about that. But oneshould not play fast and loose, destroying it the more quickly (Raubbau treiben were the words he used); rather should one be sowing seeds of what is truly fruitful for the future. Speaking of Berlin, he went on to say: Of course you might go there, but do not imagine that the future lies there. It was in the later 19th century that it attained its recent greatness. That was a time of spiritual void^\u2014^here he took pencil and paper and sketched an empty hole\u2014a time when the old spirituality was no more and the new was not yet bom. Vienna may now seem utterly broken, suffering far worse starvation, but its roots are true and it will rise again. \u00bb In the late autumn of 1919 I went on from Switzerland to Germany and shortly afterwards to Poland\u2014to the South-Eastemborders of that country , where my home had been, \"^e towns and villages were laid waste; famine and typhus were raging. My w^e and I joined the War Victims' Relief Mission, organised by English and American Quakers. In the autumn of 1920\u2014The Threefold State having in the meantime been published\u2014we decided to retimi to England, hoping to help build up a movement for the Threefold Order. There was a public conference at Dornach\u2014^the first open ing of the Goetheanum building\u2014so we made the detour, receiving uifforgettable impressions in the great auditorium, with ever-varied lights and shades from the coloured windows playing on the rough-hewn wood, the unending life and variety of sculptured forms. This time I did not ask to see Dr. Steiner personally. But a not very respectful friend, wanting to reach me quickly, had sent a telegram with the rough and ready address: C/o Dr. Steiner,Domach. T o my no small embarrassment there was Dr. Steiner making his way to us through the crowded ranks to the middle ofthe haU where we sat, just before one of his lectures. \"Why, you are not to be recognised,\" he said laughingly as he handed me the telegram. (I had been growing a beard in the meantime.) This was the rst time Mary Adams met him. He was very good to her and gave her much spiritual help in the years that followed. Back in England, we soon found omrselves in collaboration with other anthroposophists, notably of the younger generation. The only lasting thing that grew out of oiu: attempts to awaken interest in the Threefold Order was the educational movement, for among those keen on the social question were the rst teachers in the Rudolf Steiner Schools in this country. (Michael Hall, known to begin with as \" The New School\", was founded after consultation? with Dr. Steiner at Ilkley in 1923; it began in South London in January, 1925.)In London the several anthroposophical ^oups had in the meantime formed a loose association, out of which three years later the \"Anthroposophical Society in Great Britain\" was to arise. Small as the effort seemed to be, Rudolf Steiner took it very seriously from the outset, and he himself was present when on the2nd September. 1923, the actual foundation of our Society took place; on the proposal of Mr. D. N. Dunlop, he consented to become President for fe. The rst anthroposophists in England had come to the move ment from manifold directions. There were well-to-do ladies and gentlemen\u2014mostly conservative in social outlook\u2014seriously inter ested in Occultism or seeking for the esoteric background of Christianity . Among them were members of the theosophical andother occult movements, for whom the \"Rosicrucian Theosophy\" taught Rudolf Steiner brought the fullment of their longings,also Freemasons who found it in the deeper spiritual background of their craft. Then there were others who, like myself, intent on new social forms and international ideals, were more in sympathy 8 9with the rising Labour movement. They , too, played a leading part in building up the anthroposophical work in this country. Rudolf Steiner himself sometimes referred to the very great differences between Britain and all Continental countries as to the forms of social and spiritual life. In Britain the most diverse seemingly contradictory currents are apt to cross and mingle- so'too, the mental attitudes and moods of soul. National self-assurance will go hand-in-hand with childlike receptivity to foreign influences- pugnacity in public life with the widest tolerance. There is acertain joy\u2014is it a heritage from Shakespeare?\u2014in the play of contrast among men. We, too, in those after-war years were dadto meet across wide gulfs of divergent outlook. The one thing Uat united us was that trait of spiritual realism on which Rudolf Steiner always redconed when he came to England. Once he has got beyond the universal barriers of our time\u2014intellectual pride Mdmaterialist agnosticism\u2014an Englishman will generally approach the' knowledge of the spiritual world in a simple and expectant frame i of mind; he is not overwhelmed with theoretic diflaculties There j is a spiritual world, he says to himself; the seer, the true sage will: be able to tell us what it is like. Then it is only a question of I well-founded condence.In fact, Rudolf Steiner gave some of his deepest occult revela- :i tions in England. I think, for instance, of the lectures he gaveI immediately before he left this country for the last time in 1924' concerning the cosmic and historic streams of Christianity; or of ' his lectures on 1st and 2nd May, 1913. in the room of the \" Zara- thustra Group\", led by Mr. H. J. Heywood-Smith and Mrs. A Drury-Lavin in South Kensington, about the Archangel Michaeland the \" renewal\" of the Mystery of Golgotha in the 19th and 20th centuries. At Easter, 1922, we heard him in the same room addressing a more intimate circle. He spoke of spiritual history leading up to the present time and of the dangers now threateningmankind. I can still see his dark penetrating eyes at that moment I looking as if into long avenues of time.! Our leading member was Mr. Harry CoUison, editor until his death in 1946 of the English editions of Dr. Steiner's works. A j many-sided man, he was a barrister and also a professional artist\u2014a vety competent portrait painter. Well-to-do and of aristocratic 1 leai^gs, he was entirely conservative, not to say authoritarian, in I political and social outlook. He was an active Freemason.I Collison was an entertaining man with a lively sense of humour; o^n it seemed as though a mischievous sprite were perched onhis shoulder, ready to play unexpected pranks at any moment. Rudolf Steiner liked him for his versatility and savoir faire. He I was a man of the world, who could express deep earnestness without I exaggerated feeling or any hint of fanaticism. I remember seeing I them together in the old Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Strat-1 for4 laughing delightedly at the antics of Sir Toby Belch. The I 'following anecdote was told me in later years by Collison himself. During the rst World War much had been said and written against the Prussian aristocratic or Junker class, till it became a phrase on everybody's lips\u2014the oftener repeated, the less clear idea of what was meant. Once on a long motor-drive with Dr. Steiner, Mr. Collison, who had a good command of German, put the question: \"Dr. Steiner, what exactly is a Junker?\" Looking straight at him with a twinkle in his eye. Dr. Steiner answered: \" You, Mr. Collison \u2014^you are a Junker.\" The old boy, who had a keen dramatic sense,was highly tickled at this unexpected turn. * I come now to the unforgettable last three years, when Dr. Steiner visited England on no less than ve occasions, generally for several weeks at a time. It was the growing reputation of 4e Waldorf School which rst brought him to us. In common with several others among Rudolf Steiner's earliest English pupils, and incidentally with some of the most influential gures in life andletters about the turn of the century. Miss Maryon had been a member of the esoteric movement known as the \" Golden Dawn \". She had there made friends with Mrs. Millicent Mackenzie, after wards Professor of Education in the University of Cardiff and a leading gmre among progressive educationists at that time. Miss Maryon wrote to her friend, drawing her attention to the pioneering work of the Stuttgart school. Mrs. Mackenzie thereupon arranged to take a party of English teachers to Dornach. At Christmas and New Year, 1921-22, Dr. Steiner gave his well-known \"Lectures to Teachers\" at the Goetheanum, primarily for the benet of the visitors from England. The lectures were held in the famous upper room in the south wing of the Goetheanum\u2014the room where the\" Christian Community \" had been initiated a few months before and in which, a year later, the smoke of the fatal conflagration was rst detected. That was the rst occasion when it fell to me to interpret Dr. Steiner into English. From then until his death I interpreted well over a hundred lectures to English audiences, not including answers to questions, conferences and informal discussions. Dr. Steiner would nearly always divide the lecture into three parts, speaking for 20 to 25 minutes at a time. The lecture was thus completed in three stages. While listening to him, I scribbled notes for all I was worth\u2014never in shorthand, which I purposely refrained from learning. My principle was to follow and enjoy the lecture, and above all neverto get flurried; sometimes at the most difcult moments I would stop writing and relax. I invented signs. At Cambridge I had known Bertrand Russell, one or two of whose pupils had been among my friends. I had picked up a smattering of symbolic logic, which I now turned to good account, though no doubt using the signs in highly unorthodox ways. For the rest, I jotted down English or German words or ad hoc abbreviations, or mere capital letters with a quick 11mental note. Thus I was able to keep the translation alive; however imperfect, still it was like the lectoe being given again by an unembarrassed and enthusiastic pupil. And there sat Rudolf Steiner a little way off at the side, often in the chair I had vacated. Looking back on it now, it seems to me that I was doing it with childlike, youthful life-forces, of which an abundance had been given me. There was a great trust in it\u2014an imconscious act offaith. In other respects I was rather shy and difdent in Dr. Steiner's presence; I was less near to him than others among his pupils, whohad more experience and condence or were farther on along the path of knowledge. Sometimes he had unexpected ways of puttingme at my ease, as on a peaceful summer afternoon at Oxford in 1922. Walking through the College garden, I met him and a few others coming from the opposite direction, or waiting for someone else to join them. I paused and greeted them. Presently Dr . Steiner bent to a nearby flowerbed, picked a large snapdragon and began tting it on the tip of my nose, looking at me with his friendly smile. But when interpreting his lectures I was never shy. I went \" all out\", there was adventure in it, and all the time, whether he were speaking or listening, I felt quiet encouragement in his presence. Sometimes in his closing address at the end of a Conference or Summer School, he would speak warm words of thanks and appre ciation. On one occasion as I was saying goodbye to him he thanked me personally , adding with emphasis: Es ist ein grosses Opfer ,\u2014it is a great sacrifice. Oh no. Dr . Steiner , I said, I do it so very gladly . But he insisted, and repeated more than once: Es ist ein grosses Opfer. Both in his lectures and in conversation with English friends, Rudolf Steiner would draw attention now and then to some nesse in words or forms of speech\u2014the manifestation of the nation-souls through the genius of language. He used to say , as Hilaire Bellocdoes in his delightful little essay on translation, you cannot really translate by the dictionary. Cheval is not equivalent to horse, nor tite to Kopf. During the T eachers' Course at Domach, for example, speaking of ethical and religious education, he put side by side the English word duty and the German Pflicht. Pflicht, he said, comesfrom the verb pflegen, meaning to tend, to nurse, to care for. (Etymologically the word is akin to the English plight.) Thedutiful man is he who does not turn aside from the world's plight, but tends it with all care. Duty, on the other hand, is akin to Deusx it is for Man to stand as worthy representative on Earth of the Divine. Related as I was by destiny to both peoples, with the task given me to help build a bridge, it was an inspiration to me whenhe spoke in tWs way. For this no longer tended (as well-meant forms of internationalism were doing at that time) to blot out distinctions, making a featureless sameness; rather it brought them out and in so doing made manifest the essential good, the Divine genius that lives in every nation.In this respect I had interesting experiences with Rudolf Steiner. Often I had to look for an adequate rendering on the spur of the moment, and went far aeld in doing so; now and then I failed completely. I was often present, too, during his interviews withothere. At Hkley in 1923 one of our friends had asked him for a meditation. Dr. Steiner asked him and me to come at an appointed hour; when we came he had the meditation ready written out in English and asked me if the language was right. In most instances, however, I think he gave meditations to his English pupils, too, in German, and indeed many of them, while they could scarcely speak or even understand the language in trivial and profane intercourse, became at home in it as a medium of spiritual science and above all of meditation. This experience accords with what Dr. Steiner himself foresaw\u2014namely, the possibility of German becoming to some extent a universal language, not for external intercourse, but as a vehicle of spiritual life, as other languages\u2014Sanskrit, Greek and Hebrew, for example\u2014have been from time to time. At one of the conferences held at Domach late into the night during the time of the 'Threefold' movement, I heard him speak to this effect, though if I understood him rightly the possibility was con tingent on historic events which are to this day undecided; more over, if fullMed, it would mean rather a sacrice of life for the German nation than any access of external greatness. In a matter of language, I once knew Rudolf Steiner to be really angry; seeing me crestfallen, he quickly added: I do not mean you personally. In the accustomed English pronunciation of Michael\u2014unlike the names of the other Archangels\u2014we practically swallow the last two syllables. (It is a shock to admit it, but we pronounce the name in effect as though we should say \" raffle\" instead of RaphcKl.) Towards the end of his life. Dr. Steiner was often speaking of the present historic time\u2014beginning with the year1879 A.D.\u2014as the 'Age of Michael'. Ito, too, he did in his lectures at Torquay, in inte)T)reting which I naturally pronounced the name as we always do; it did not occur to me to do otherwise. When I visited him at his hotel that evening he was indignant. The ending -el, he said, is the name of God: how can you slur it over in that way? Pronounce the vowels by all means in the accustomed English way, but do not slur them over. It is a different matter when you give the name to a man or boy. In German, too, we have the Christian name Michel (which, in effect, is pronounced 'Michl'), but when referring to the Divine Being you should articulate fe full three syllables, Micha-el. Then, being evidently under the impression that I might think this impossible in English, he went on: You put a stop to spiritual progress if you will insist that your mother-tongue can only be spoken according to present- day conventions. Think, for example, of the word Weltanschauung-,one would suppose it the most typical of German words. Yet in a standard dictionary before Goethe's time you will not nd it. The 12 13vital streams of spiritual life are ever forming and re-forming language; you become sterile if you set yomrselves against this. He knew us only too well. Often since then our friends have attempted to pronounce the Divine name, Michael, no less articulately than, for example, Gabriel or Raphael; time and again we fall back into the old habit. Rudolf Steiner knew how great is the power of habit and convention in English at the present time. But there are better and deeper things of which he was equally well aware. He sensed the signicance of the peculiarly English form of oratory; the abrupt phrases, the sudden beginnings and ending, the unexpected intervals of silence, the avoidance of fluentrhetoric. In contrast to French and German, he once described the ideal\u2014as it were, the spiritual Archetype\u2014^which underlies the En^sh way of speaking. It is concerned with the ethic of lan^agerather than with the rhetoric or the logic. This nds expression in silence rather than in speech as such. To put it paradoxically, we speak to give occasion for the intervals of silence in which acommon experience is evoked of what is deeper than any outward words. * The English Teachers' Course at the Goetheanum led up to further plans, which in the year 1922 brought Dr. Steiner to the historic centres of English cultural life\u2014Stratford-on-Avon and Oxford. Among those who came with Professor Mackenzie to the coiuse at Domach was Miss M. Cross, of the Priory School at King's Langley. For its initial impulse the Rudolf Steiner educa tional'movement in this country is very greatly indebted to Miss Cross. She was a member of the ' New Ideals in Education' Com mittee, which arranged annual conferences, and at her suggestion Rudolf Steiner was invited to the Conference for 1922, held at Stratford during the Easter vacation and in connection with the Shakespeare Festival. ' Drama and Education' was the subject for this year, and Dr. Steiner was invited both as an educationist and as a distinguished authority on Goethe. His two lectures aroused such interest that he was asked to give a third. He was here speaking side by side with foremost representatives of English life and letters, John Maseeld and John Drinkwater among them. I remember the latter at a social gathering asking me many questions about Rudolf Steiner. At Stratford I used to have lunch at the house where Dr. Steiner was staying. Present among others were MiUicent Mackenzie, Fran Marie Steiner, and two or three leaders of anthroposophical groups in London. Two moments of the conversation stand out in my mind. One morning there had been two lectures\u2014^by ProfessorComford of Cambridge and Sir Henry Newbolt\u2014the former scholarly and learned, the latter masterly in style, though I confessthis did not appeal to me as did the homely, rough-hewn manner of Johii Maseeld a day or two before or after. Commenting on 14the two lecturers that morning. Dr. Steiner said: A lecture like ^ Professor Cornford's you might have heard in Germany; Sir Henry Newbolt's, never. Then he bethought himself a moment: In Austria, however, you might well have heard it. And he went on to say: This peculiar accomplishment in form and bearing came both to England and to Austria originally through Spanish inuences. On another occasion Dr. Steiner, addressing himself to the ; elderly English anthroposophists who were present, foretold: You , will be reincarnated before very long in Mid-Europe; that will beat a time \"when Mid-Europe will be going barefoot\". And i speaking of the character and task of the German people, he went ( on to say: \"The Germans are not really nationalistic.\" This was met with evident surprise; the War had not long been over. Dr. Steiner repeated his statement and proceeded to illustrate it with a story from the opening weeks of the Waldorf School\u2014a time when the War, ofcially at least, was scarcely ended. The children in Rudolf Steiner schools are taught foreign languages\u2014French and English in this instance\u2014beginning at the earliest age, plajdng and singing. Of all the tunes and words they had been learning, said Dr. Steiner, the children, running up and down the corridors and in the playground, would keep singing, not any German Lied or folksong, but \" My heart's in the Highlands \". 1 How often during the years and decades that followed hpe I had occasion to think of the deep truth that lay in Dr. Steiner's words, despite all appearances to the contrary. The Germans lack the instinctive national coherence which belongs to most European peoples of modem time, which impels their deeds and destini^ for good or ill and somehow forms and guards them like a gift ofNature. If they are nationalistic they are so on more theoretic or philosophic grounds, having convinced themselves that this is the true idea to follow. This is the very reason why they could carry it to such ridiculous and even criminal extremes. Nature will not protect nor moderate what does not spring from Nature. A far-J seeing man\u2014himself a patriotic member of a people that was at war with Germany\u2014said to me once during the first World War: \"The Germans are idealistic.\" I looked at him questioningly. They are sincere indealists, he went on to explain; right or mistaken, they are always looking for ideals\u2014^wanting to devote themselves to some ideal. In the late autumn of 1923 I went over to Holland to see Dr. Steiner. I had to bring him some message\u2014^with which I myself was at least partly identified\u2014^in which he felt a lack of under standing on our part; indeed, I scarcely ever saw him so gravely' troubled as on this occasion. He said to me then: It is of great importance to mankind that the true character of the German people, as revealed in Spiritual Science, should come to be understood in England. (He was referring to such truths as he had 15 CB-2explained in Ws lectures on the nation-souls.) I think I know nowwhat he had in mind. Without a deeper spiritual background, the Gennans as a nation are in the long run an insoluble riddle to English i^ople. I mean not individuals but the nation as such.What individual Germans have to offer, even if only on a modest scale, is generously recognised and thankfully received. The people as a people remain an irritating puzzle. One sees it in the memoirs of British statesmen and diplomats, notably those who are most trying to be fair\u2014trying to arrive at a sympathetic understandinginstead of merely judging from without. All this is connected with the destiny to which Rudolf Steiner was referring, which somehow withholds from the German people a self-contained and consistent national form, because in fact they have historic tasks of another kind. For the summer vacation of 1922 a larger public Conference was arranged, to be held at Oxford. It was entitled: \"Spiritual V alues in Education and in Social Life \". We were trying to realise what Dr. Steiner longed for in those years. Face to face with the urgent needs of the time, we should meet on common ground withmen and women of consequence, who with all diversities of out look had a feeling for spiritual activity as the creative factor in social reconstruction. Prepared for several months beforehand, the Conference had two main organisers. One was Professor Millicent Mackenzie, who had in this the sympathy and support of her husband, the Hegelian philosopher J. S. Mackenzie, a former Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. The other was Mr. Arnold Freeman, Warden of the Shefeld Educational Settlement. A younger member of the Fabian Society, he had been an active collaborator of the Webbs and others and was now intensely keen on the achievement of a Threefold Social Order. The Conference was mainly held at Manchester College, of which Dr. L. P. Jacks, the well-known editor of the Hibbert Journal, was Principal. In a book published not long before, he had expressed ideas not unlike those in \"The Threefold State\", concerning which a substantial article by Dr. Steiner appeared about this time in the Hibbert. Dr. Jacks was there to welcome us on the rst evening, and at his invitation \u2014on the second Sunday of the Conference \u2014Rudolf Steiner gave an evening address in the College Chapel. It was a memorable occasion\u2014the quiet dignity of the building, the evening sun shining in through the high windows, and Rudolf Steiner speaking, from the awakened consciousness of modern time, aboutthe secret of the Trinity and the Mystery of Golgotha. Among the lecturers at Oxford were the late Glutton Brock,C. Delisle Bums, J. S. Mackenzie, and Dr. Maxwell Garnett of the League of Nations Union. Mr. H. A. L. Fisher, a former Presidentof the Board of Education, sent an opening address. In the morn ings Dr. Steiner gave an extended lecture-course on education,followed by a shorter one on social questions generally. Frau 1\u00abMarie Steiner brought with her a group of experienced artists from Dornach. Eurhythmy performances and demonstrations were given at Keble, where there was a larger stage. Lectures were also given by well-known teachers of the Waldorf School, Dr. Caroline von Heydebrand among them. The Waldorf teachers who came withDr. Steiner to our Conferences and Summer Schools were always welcome. Based on their practical experience and devoted work, their lectures\u2014spiced now and then with wit and anecdote\u2014were listened to with keen attention; sometimes with uproarious laughter. Rudolf Steiner, sitting there in the front row, was very evidently happy at these times. Of the wider aims we set ourselves at Oxford\u2014the movement for a Threefold Order above all\u2014little would seem to have been realised. It was a time when intellectual idealists had not yet suffered the disillusionments of the succeeding decades; they did not feel the need for deeper spiritual insight. Yet the effort was not in vain, for in those after-war years it set the tone for our work, revealing as it did the open and world-wide scope of the Anthropo- sophical Movement as conceived by its founder. Moreover, itled to the beginnings of the Rudolf Steiner school movement in this country, some of whose ablest representatives found their way tous during the preparations or as an outcome of the Conference. I think especially of Daphne Olivier (afterwards Daphne Harwood), who with her sensitive artistic nature, her candid enthusiasm and singleness of heart and mind became Rudolf Steiner's devoted pupil.Several of those who have since become the bearers of the Anthropo- sophical Movement in this country became acquainted with it inthe rst place through her. It was in those years that Rudolf Steiner met Margaret Mac- millan. She had been one of the band of strong-willed, idealistic men and women who at the end of the 19 th century founded the Independent Laboiur Party. She then became a national gure through her pioneering work in the Nursery School movement. At Ilkley in August, 1923\u2014through the initiative of a very energetic lady . Miss Nina Beverley , who also helped to develop the Anthropo- sophical Publishing Company in London\u2014a further educationalconference was held, at which Rudoli Steiner consented to give the main lectures. This was inaugurated by Miss Macmillan. Ilkley is near the industrial cities of the West Riding, notably Bra(fford where she had begun her social work and where some of her closest friends became active in the Anthroposophical Move ment. As often happens in the North of England, it stiU preserves the vigorous and elemental quality of the surrounding moors, the mighty rocks, the running streams of clear water. It is the countryof the Brontes and there are also memories of Druid times. I was particularly glad that after Stratford and Oxford, Rudolf Steinershould also experience this aspect of the English scene. His arrival having been delayed, I was at Harwich to meet him in the emly 17morning and we travelled straight across England instead of going of Margaret Macmillan with warm appreciation. On one occasion, via London. The train went through the fen country\u2014Ely and i I am told, he said that if she and he had met ten or twenty years Cambridge.

He had been Dr. Steiner's in nearby Anglesey and the stone circle on Penmaenmawr moxm-host when the latter came to the theosophical congress in London tain. Next year, in August, 1924, we were at Torquay, whence at the beginning of the century. Dr. Steiner visited the ruins of King Arthur's Castle at Tintagel.

Rudolf Steiner met him with warm affection; 1819together they discussed the world-wide and far-seeing aims in the pursuit of which Mr. Dunlop, shortly after Dr. Steiner's death, was to inaugiurate the \"World Power Conference\"\u2014a periodic event which played a prominent and helpful part in international affairs during the succeeding years. Dr. Steiner in his turn enhsted Dun- lop's help. He introduced him to Ita Wegman, M.D., in collaboration with whom he was at that time developing especially the medical side of the new spiritual movement. Dr. Wegman was with Dr. Steiner on his last two visits to England; lectures were also given to invited groups of doctors. Dunlop helped put the pharmaceutical side of this work on a sound business footing inthis country. Saying goodbye after their rst meeting. Rudolf Steiner took Dunlop's hands in his and said repeatedly: \"We are brothers.\" Of the Summer Schools which we owed to Dunlop's initiative, he ^d that they should be written in the 'golden book' of the history of the Anthroposophical Movement. Two of his deepest and most comprehensive lecture-cycles were indeed given at these Summer Schools; here above aU he came to meet the need for detailed knowledge of the world beyond the Threshold and for a spiritual' Cosmogony', in which he recognised the true and innate tendency of the Western spirit. In Rudolf Steiner's encounters with men and women such as D. N. Dunlop and Margaret Macmillan, the world-wide character of his own task can be perceived. He himself represented a certain method of approach to esoteric knowledge\u2014a method largely founded in the lAilosophic genius of Middle Euro^. This in his hands made possible a genuine integration of the scientic spirit of the West wi& the deep realms of mystical and occult experience into which man enters when he transcends the Threshold. Such integration alone makes it possible for modem man to approach the. hidden spiritual world without losing hold of the most precious achievement of the West\u2014the inner spiritual freedom which goes with independent thinking, intellectual clarity and probity of thought. In the spiritual method developed by Rudolf Steiner we may perceive the genuine contribution of the German-speaking world to mankind's progress. Every such contribution is indis pensable to the whole. Yet, sternly as he might insist on femethodic path he had to teach, Rudolf Steiner fully recognised the spiritual approach\u2014often radically different\u2014of those who tooktheir start from other premisses both of the East and of the West. His full life-story reveals how intertwined his destined mission was with other spiritual streams and with outstanding individualities of other countries and continents. On the physical plane the 'spiritual guidance of mankind' wcaks in manifold and seemingly contradictory ways\u2014diversified by geo^aphical and secular conditions. Yet it is there on every plane; it has its origin in regions far transcending the polarities and 20' pairs of opposites' by which the physical manifestations of life are orientated and in terms of which we have to form our standards of discrimination. The initiators of tme progress know one another face to face, across the inevitable differences of spiritual pathway. Thirty-three years will soon have passed since Rudolf Steiner's death. From the eternal sources from which his life-work was inspired the spiritual guidance of mankind works on; it will nd access to human hearts wherever upon Earth they are open toreceive it. Mindful of this, while fai&ul in the care and practical pursuit of what he has bequeathed, the anthroposophical move ment will remain truest to its founder.R E L I G I O U S R E N E W A L Emil Bock clear sunshine, early on a Sunday morning in August, 1916,1 was walking from Tegel into Berlin. For two years already toe war had been raging; after recovering from a serious wound I was serving as an interpreter. Unexpectedly, I had been sent at ve intoe morning to one of toe big factories in Tegel, where there had been sabotage by French prisoners of war who worked there. The hearings were soon over, and I thought the best way of using toe early hour would be to go all toe way home on foot. My feelings occupied by toe contrast between toe golden solemnity of high summer and the tragic events of the time, Ireached toe centre of toe city. Then I noticed surprisingly many people streaming into the \" New Church \", toe so-called \" German Caitoedral\", on toe Gendarmenmarkt. I recognised a number of university professors; and it seemed to me as if from every direction representatives of toe spiritual life of Berlin were coming together. With eager expectation, but with a touch of scepticism\u2014^since I had sometimes attended toe sermons of well-known preachers in Berlin\u2014went in too. I could have no idea that through what I was to hear a curtain would be lifted for me upon a new world. With amazement I looked into a realm which was at once very strange to me, and yet on a deeper level entirely familiar. I hadnever heard such preaching. The South German voice gave full expression to genuine warmth of heart. But more important still: a comprehensive life of knowledge revealed itself in illumined clarity.A characteristic conception of toe world, which could be felt in the backgroimd, became more concrete at certain points, in denite statements about Christ and the spiritual world. The sermon was not on a particular text, but gave something of an introduction to St John's Gospel in general. On toe way out I learned that fate had led me into toe inaugural sermon by Dr. Friedrich Rittelmeyer, who had just transferred his eld of work from Nurnberg to Berlin. The question arose in my mind, with a mysterious, strong feeling of things to come: \" May it, after all, be possible to nd a religious message and method of work which would be honestly tted for our time and strong enough to have a healing effect in our crises ?\" My working-class origin and education at a modem school, where mathematics, scientic subjects, and modem languages were mainly taught, had prepared me for anything rather than the study of theology. I had indeed while at school made friends with a number of grammar-school boys for whom it was a matter of course that they would enter toe ministry. And there had been no lack of well- meant advice, seeking to persuade me that I should prepare for toe same calling. But it seemed to me more and more that it wouldbe toe most unnatural thing in toe world for me one day to put on I toe gown of a Protestant minister.I had no particular calling in mind. But from an early stage I had intended to earn enough for university studies by giving lessons. I hoped to nd a place somewhere in the spiritual life of toe timewhere it would be possible, in a world becoming more and more external, to do effective service for inner values. In a general way I dreamed of a renewal of culture affecting everything. * * * * c I soon came to know Rittelmeyer personally. The approach of the 21-year-old student in toe grey army overcoat gave him, as he. often said, a glimpse of his own future; toe new generation was appearing, with whom he could begin a new work. I felt that something or someone else must stand behind Rittelmeyer, and I was waiting eagerly for the moment when, in conversation or com panionship wito Mm, this riddle would be answered. And then Rittelmeyer spoke of Dr. Rudolf Steiner as toe greatest, God-sent contemporary. At rst this did not convey enough for me to see j clearly all that was involved. I was faced by a host of questions.But I was deeply stirred when it occured to me that I had come across the name of Rudolf Steiner once before, in a very peculiar way. About a year before I had had to examine, in the postal censorship ofce at toe Silesian station in Berlin, toe printed post for Switzerland. I had been struck by toe innumerable books and lecture-series, bearing the name of one author. Dr. Rudolf Steiner, which were sent by the Berlin Philosophical and Anthroposophical Publishing Company to Dornach, where toe rst Goetoeanum was being built. Ofcially, it was clear, there was no reason for detailed examination of these parcels, or for objections to them. But I was attracted by toe endless abundance of writings by this more than prolic author. And the titles indicated subjects not limited to toe surface of life. So on several occasions I took such books or lecture-cycles home to my lodgings and read until late at night. I ( met in them an atmosphere which made me feel that they might I open up new, wide horizons for me. Yet I had to say to myself:the time for this has not quite come. When I again heard Rudolf Steiner's name from Rittelmeyer, toe feelings I had had then were re-awakened. And yet\u2014^how could I connect toe warm language of the heart, in wMch toe sermons at the \"New Church\" spoke, wito toe language of knowledge used in these writings in an almost more than prosaic philosophical style? But my reverence and trust for Rittelmeyercould only be increased when I realised that he, who had been in Ms own way a master for so long, felt himself as pupil of a genius who was so very different. I had to find my own approach\u2014and so it must be for everyone, fundamentally speaking\u2014^to the new directions of know ledge opened up by Rudolf Steiner. Rittelmeyer attempted to 22 23convey to me in the language of religion ways of approachingcertain mdamental elements of Anthroposophical knowledge. Only with difculty could I understand him. I was not concerned with particular religious problems. Either the eld of world- knowledge would open out as a whole for Christian religious life,or everything was in vain. And, with a clarity beyond all expecta tions, this comprehensive, penetrating vision for world-knowledge was provided. This I found when, in the spring and summer of 1917,1 was able to hear Dr. Steiner himself. Rittelmeyer made use of the permission given to him to bring guests to Dr. Steiner's intimate lectures, and took Eberhard Kurras, with whom he had already corresponded from Niirnberg, and me, both still in uniform. The lectures were given in the Group meeting-room, consisting of three ordinary rooms joined together,of the Anthroposophical Society headquarters in the Geisburg- strasse, not far from the Nollendorfplatz. They were attended by about 100 to 150 members of the Society. Nothing that Dr. Steiner described was difcult or strange to me. One cramping limitation after another, in my thinking and in my soul, fell away. What a deep breath of relief I drew, when Dr. Steiner described the new,real thinking, in the rst lectme we heard. The cycle then being given was called \"The Karma of Materialism.\" It was the time of the centenary celebrations of the Reformation; Rittelmeyer was giving the great addresses which are published in the little book, Luther Among Us. How often the thought stirred in the souls of us yoimger ones that, in the midst of the confusion of war, a new Reformation was due. And Rittelmeyer, too, sought with us for a new stage in Christian history. Among the climaxes in Dr. Steiner's series belonged the lectures in which he illuminated Luther's innermost character and destiny. We began to discern the impulses for the renewal of civilisation which could proceed from Anthroposophy. On one of these Group evening I could not leave the book table, where lay in still greater profusion the series of lectures some ofwhich I had had to examine as censor two years before. Obeying a strong inner impulse, I bought the Hamburg series on St John's Gospel, though the last money I had was only just enough. I havenever devoured a book with such feverish enthusiasm as this. I had suddenly found the bridge between Rudolf Steiner's lectures and Friedrich Rittelmeyer's sermons. In a warm, golden light the eld of religious life and knowledge lay before my soul. From now on there was no real doubt about the content of my work in my future calling. But only gradually could I survey as a whole the unimaginably rich and wide foundations Rudolf Steiner had dready given for a cosmic and human knowledge of Christ and aChristian knowledge of the cosmOs and of man. After die lectures given in the circle of members, Rudolf Steiner liked to stay on for personal conversations. The circle was thenstill small enough to make this possible. He usually sat beside Dr. Rittelmeyer, and the conversation soon passed from the content of the lecture to the tumultuous problems of day-to-day events. Sayings which sprang from the greatest anxiety about mankind, and unsparing descriptions of personalities who were reckoned as great gures in public life, made a deep impression on us. Duringthis time we could come to Dr. Steiner for our rst personal con versations with him, and received advice about omr studies, and guidance for our innermost work upon ourselves. From 1917 onwards Rudolf Steiner was always to be found in the front line of a violent battle. Up to the outbreak of war he had used the temporary lull in world affairs to build up a modem\" Theosophy \", a comprehensive wisdom of the supersensible, with its centre in the contemplation of the Being of Cfist. In the midst of the age of triumphant scientic knowledge about nature, a modem spiritual science, in the most exact sense of the word, had quietly come into being, in creative abundance. Light was thrown on the whole mythological and religious history of mankind, with all its documents. And amazing contemporary events in the spiritual world were indicated, which were connnected with the approach of Christ and His gradual new revelation in the realm of the etheric. The outbreak of war had put an end to this quiet creative, esoteric work. Rudolf Steiner tumed clearly and decisively from inner to external things, from the esoteric to the exoteric. This became quite plain, when after the Russian Revolution and the entry of America into active belligerence, the war entered a peculiarly tragic and dangerous stage for all humanity. At thesame time in the life-work of Rudolf Steiner the point had been reached when the full development of \" Theosophy \" into \"Anthro posophy\", of spiritual science into a renewed science of nature,became possible. It was now a question of making Anthroposophy practically useful and fertile in fe most varied elds of outer life.We younger ones, who had only just become members of the Anthroposophical Society, could become fellow-ghters in the struggle for the future of civilisation. Rudolf Steiner came forward with the impulse of the \" Threefold Social Order\", which had among its purposes that of rescuing the real mission of Middle Europe, then experiencing military defeat\u2014 the mission to show humanity a way into the future, guided by ideas which originated in the Spirit and were nevertheless practic^y realisable. We were witnesses of the tireless, self-sacricing endeavoiurs of Rudolf Steiner to awaken the circles of those responsible for political leadership in Middle Europe, and to inspirein them the courage to support real ideas. And after the Armistice he took on the superhuman labours involved in the Threefold Commonwealth movement. The idea of the new Threefold Social Order could not then be given practical realisation. But from the mobilisation of evety 2425effort the new educational movement developed, headed by the Waldorf School at Stuttgart, and soon there were inspiring begin nings of entirely new knowledge, and new possibilities of work,in science, medicine, and several other special elds. On the day after the November Revolution in 1918, I entered the theological faculty. With a few theological student friends, I threw myselfinto the hope that the evangelical Churches woidd now develop courage for a genuinely free spiritual life\u2014^for example, for the separation of Church and State\u2014so that the way would be openfor a new, free kind of religious work. We were able to arrange at this time for Dr. Rittelmeyer to give frequent talks to student audiences, large or small. Only too soon it was evident that in the Churches everything would remain the same. All the more did we, who saw the approach of a new age of Christianity, which Anthro- posophy could stimulate, search for the possibility of a new Reformation. Independently of one another, several groups and individuals approached Rudolf Steiner with questions about a renewal of reh^ous life. Not so much the plans of a group of Protestantministers, as conversations between two young people and Rudolf Steiner, proved in the event decisive. A German student, who had been an ofcer in the war, and had been brought into great distress of mind by the course of European events, asked in February, 1920, whether after the Petrine and Pauline form of Christianity the Johannine form could not now be brought into being. Dr. Steiner's answer was that he himself had to bring spiritual science and could not come forward in any way as a religious innovator. But\" if you, with a group of thirty to forty like-minded people, carry through what you intend, it would have great signicance for humanity.\" Two months later, when Rudolf Steiner was giving his rst great course of lectures to doctors, a Swiss woman student, who asked simUar questions, received the answer: \" It might well be possible to achieve something even within the Churches, if a considerable number of young tiieologians took possession of the pulpits.\" Rudolf Steiner's willingness to help was lively and active, and so the possibility of a course for young theologians was at once dis cussed: \" In such a course it would be possible to speak much more intimately than can be done at present with the doctors.\" Although Dr. Steiner had made it quite plain that he reckoned with energetic activity\u2014^thus in the second conversation he had advised that contact should be made with the questioner of the first\u2014^both these persons, almost overwhelmed by the great possi bilities opening up before tiiem, considered practical steps only a year later, when they met in Domach. When the Swiss woman student came to Berlin at Easter, 1921, to continue her studies there, what she related in our circle about the two conversations of the previous year kindled so much enthusiasm that we insistedthat not one day more should be allowed to pass unused. There were in Marburg, Tubingen, and Berlin groups of young people who had long been burning for what now seemed to be on the way. In the name of about twenty friends. Dr. Steiner was asked at Whitsun to give us advice and direction in a course of lectures. As if something for which he had long been waiting now at last came to him in tangible form, he met our request wif the greatest willin^ess, and invited us to Stuttgart for a course, which was to begin in a little over two weeks' time. # * * * From then onwards a wind lled our sails which carried the little ship powerfully onwards. We had to take Rudolf Steiner's words and bearing as implying that we had to catch up much lost time, and that it might soon be too late for the beginning we intended. It was important for us, and surely not wifout signi cance in the objective course of destiny, that we had to nd among us younger ones the starting-point of our joint activity. Of the eighteen, with whom Rudolf Steiner met eight times that June, one was 30, all the rest between 19 and 27, half of them younger than 23. Only then, when we had to nd in a little more than two months about ten times as many like-minded companions and bring them together, did we begin to approach older people. Obviously, we were in the closest contact over everything with Dr. Rittelmeyer, and reckoned on him as a leading fellow-worker when the time was ripe. In spite of the almost insuperable exchange problems, at that time of inflation. Dr. Steiner, relying on the willingness of friends to help, had invited the circle, which was to be so considerably enlarged by then, to come to the Goetheanum at Dornach for the month of September. Now hectic activity began. Our small circle separated in aU directions, in order to get on the track everywhere,as far aeld as Mecklenburg, of those who were ready, like our selves, to devote themselves to religious renewal. Aiid in fact, when in September Rudolf Steiner gave us 29 lectures, there was the most varied assembly of about 110 participants. Naturally the transition into the inner necessities of a new age of Christianity, as this stood before our minds, could not be made without great difculties. And so we had soon to overcome hindrances that were boimd up with the history of spiritual life. Our aim would not be accomplished if a number of theologians now simply made use of the possibilities offered by Anthroposophy fora new understanding of the Bible and of the mysteries of Christ. Rudolf Steiner had opened up for us the prospect that at a time when Christian life had taken the path of intellectual theologising, real religious substance could be quickened again only by a renewal of sacramental life tted to the present time, and therefore only by the courage to found a new priesthood. 26 27But among the participants in September there were a number of Protestant theologians who had no feeling for the fact that intellectual discussion, of the kind that had become their natural element, meant the death of religion. Through their questions, which were not genuine questions, but themes for discussion, they occupied the whole eld of our meeting; and so we felt with acute anxiety the danger approaching that we should be held back inintellectual preliminaries instead of going forward to build up a new. priestly, sacramental form of religious work. We fought a despairing battle in the intervening meetings, when the questions to be addressed to Dr. Steiner were worked out For our course the White Room had been put at our disposal, a room for Eurhythmy practice high up xmder the roof of the south wing of the rst Goedieanum. Before each meeting I fetched Dr. Steiner from his studio in the wooden workshop building called the Schreinerei and accompanied him across to the Goetheanum and up the many stairs to the White Room. From the third day on I begged him constantly, instead of the so-called \" discussion hours \" which alternated with the lectures, to give lectures then as well. But he said: \" Be patient: we must go through all this!\" As though it were necessary, beyond the personal participation of those present, to give a new direction to a whole spiritual stream within humanity ,he devoted himself with the ^eatest calm to questions which made the younger ones among us impatient and irritable. But we were relieved when after some days he acceded to our request, and, instead of holding discussions, gave lectures which were connected with the questions I had handed to him on the way over. Thus a number of fundamental, comprehensive lectures, inexhaustible in the perspectives they opened up, came to be given. In the second half of the fortnight, although it was plain that by no means all the participants would have the courage to become bearers of the religious movement which was to be founded, what Rudolf Steiner gave us was an immediate preparation and equip ment for priestly work, with sacraments renewed for our time. TTie future was more important than the present, and so he spoke, over the heads of those still caught up in tradition and discussion (they had been given their full due), as if the only persons present were those who would really take up fully into their wills the inten tions of the spiritual world and make them into earthly facts. Not that answers to theological questions were not given. The old Dr. Gever, Dr. Rittelmeyer's close friend and allv at Niirnberg (Dr. Rittelmeyer himself could not be present at Domach because of illness), said he had always been astonished in what degree Rudolf Steiner was at home in the mathematical, scientic, and historical elds of academic knowledge: now he saw that he was a master in theology too, in every detail: he was really a whole university in himsetf. * \u00bb * *For the circle of those who had made up their minds\u2014we were to begin with not even 40\u2014a year of intensive preparation followed. Rudolf Steiner was at all times available to us as adviser. It was not quite easy to nd the balance between the will of the younger ones, eager to rush forward, and the urging, chiefly by the older ones, that a rm foundation must be laid. In this, too. Dr. Steiner helped. He accepted both attitudes as justied, but made quite clear to us that there was no time to be lost. Among the undertakings through which we hoped to nd and win for our work further companions eager for action, there was in particular a conference for theologians held in Niirnberg, on the initiative of Rittelmeyer and Geyer, at Easter, 1922. And in fact several valuable people came into connection at this time with the purposes for which we stood. Through everything that we under took there went a strong wind of enthusiasm, which we ourselves felt as something given to us. At Whitsun, Dr. Rittelmeyer made his farewell to his congregation in Berlin. We pictured that he. Dr . Geyer (who was ten years older) and I (more than twenty years younger), would have the task of leading our movement. And so the three of us tried to prepare the nal emergence of the movement in detail. Many of the younger friends had already allotted among themselves the towns where we hoped to nd congregations, and were looking round for people who sought what we were to bring. In September Dr. Steiner was expecting the whole circle at Domach, so that we might be nally prepared and equipped forour task. In order to achieve the right sense of community in feeling and willing among us, we decided to meet at a quiet placein August, and learn from each other the results reached during the time of preparation. Before these last steps the three of us, Geyer, Rittelmeyer, and I, were able to be in Dornach for a fort night, to put before Dr. Steiner the questions which were still to beasked, before the common starting-point of our work. It happened that this was the time, at the end of July and beginning of August, when the \"World Economy \" course was given. We were allowed to attend this course as guests. These days were a rare opportunity to experience the world-wide breadth of view with which Rudolf Steiner suggested new directions for the most modern problems of money and world economy. We were able to have eight conversations of an hour each with him. He answered our questions in the most concentrated way, so that at the end it was as if he had given us a further course, very rich in content. Now everything was concerned with the practical religious work of forming congrega tions. on the threshold of which we stood. It was a particular favour of destiny that led our circle in August, 1922, to Breitbrunn, on what was still the quiet shore ofthe Ammersee in Upper Bavaria. There Michael Bauer, through whom Rittelmeyer had found the way to Rudolf Steiner more than a decade before, and Margareta Morgenstem, the widow of the 2829poet, were living. They had a speciaUy heart-felt concern for ourproject, and with other friends had prepared everything tor us. In a cow-shed which had been cleared for our meetings, a room had been arranged and decorated with flowers. A solemn and joyful sense of expectation united us wiA such elemental force that even the withdrawal of Dr . Geyer coifld onlybe a cloud, passing over a brightly shimng sun. Somethmg w^ a p p r o a c h i n g u s t h a t c o u l d b e f e l t a s a w o m a n m a y f e e l w h e n s h eexnects a child W as not the stable a true element of Bethlehem ? The spiritual power hovered over us, for which we were prepanng to make an earthly dwelling and corporeal form. It seemed to be reflected in the archetypal character woven into the landscape; the blue lake nearby and in the distance the white-capped mountains.It was as if we had entered a universal Galilee. Further we felt that through Christian Morgenstem, who was near to us as mspmngsenius and also humanly through his wife, and through Michel Bauer, through whose almost completely shattered physique thewarm gold of a soul permeated by Clmst was shining, wholestreams of human history , lled with longing for the Spint and for Christ Were bringing their gifts Uke godparents at the cradle ot a new Christmas event. The expectation at Breitbrunn was followed, in the days from the 6th to the 22nd of September , by the fullment at Domach. What happened there so quietly, unnoticed by the surroundingworld, lifted us so much beyond ourselves that it is scarcely possible to describe in words the core of our experience. Ora consisting of 45 people, including three women, was with Dr . Sternertwice every day , often for hours on end. Again the high WhiteRoom was allotted to us. But this time the essential was not the receiving of instruction. What Rudolf Stei^r gave us was no\"Theological Course\". In our midst the Chnstian ntual andsacramental life was born in the form correspondmg to the presenttime, the age of the spiritual soul. Rudolf Sterner was among us with'auiet humility and devotion, and at the same time with highest spiritual authority . The time was ripe and our ^earte wre open;and so he could bring down to us from heaven what the spiritualp o w e r s u n i t e d w i t h C h r i s t , a n d s e r v i n g H i m , h a d i n t e n d e d a s agift of blessing for future humanity .

I t i m p r e s s e d u s v e r y m u c h t h a t e v e r y 30morning Dr. Steiner gave him a detailed summary, on clearlywritten pages, of the lecture that would be given in the evening. We now saw for ourselves how full every day was for him. There was for us something symbolic in the alternation between the White Room high up under the roof, where we passed the days, and the great auditorium, where we sat among the audience in Ae evening. Inwardly, we had also to be at home on diiferent levels. The wonderful structure of the rst Goetheanum, having been seven years building, was in use for only 2^ years, between its opening in the autumn of 1920 and its destruction by re on the Sylvester night between 1922 and 1923. A quarter of a year afterour great days, the annihilating re was rst noticed in ie White Room. By the grace of destiny, two important stages in the development of our task fell within these years. When, after the disaster of the re. Dr. Steiner wrote the retrospective account,\" The Goetheanum during Ten Years,\" he mentioned these stages: \"At the end of September and the beginning of October (1921) a number of German theologians gathered at the Goetheanum, bearing within them the impulse towards a Christian rehgious renewal. The work then done here found a conclusion in Septem ber, 1922. What I experienced in September, 1922, with these theologians, in the small room in the south wing, where later there was rst discovered, I must reckon among the festivals of my life.\" {Das Goetheanum, 18.3.23.) * * * * If to-day it appears to us like a miracle that the inauguration of the new ritual drawn from the spiritual world, and therewith the foundation of the \"Christian Community\", fell within the short life-time of the first Goetheanum\u2014all the more was it an invaluable grace of destiny that Rudolf Steiner, before in March, 1925, death put an end to his many-sided labours on earth, was able to accom pany our work with his advice and help for two and a half years.He never denied himself to us, however ^eat the burden of work which he had to carry, for example, during his visits to Stuttgart. So one or two or three of us, who were responsible for the leader ship of the Christian Community, were able to report to him in many conversations about progress in nding congregations, and to ask his advice about the problems which arose out of the work. Through this period, above all, ran the golden chain of moments, when he transmitted to us as a gift of the spiritual world the words which completed our sacraments, as we had received them up to that time, and so made it possible for us to celebrate and shape afresh one grfeat festival after another in the course of the year. When, early in 1923, I received from him in this way the Burial Service for children, he was himself radiant with thankfulness for this special form of creativity, which was at the same time the highest art of receiving. Twice he came to me on that day\u2014^it was 31 CB-3during a conference\u2014^with the words: \"Is not the text beautiful!\" that his friends, for example in July at Amhem, were appalled, and In the midst of the mighty waves of events during the Christmas acutely anxious about him. Those who knew of it were deeply Foundation Meeting in the last days of 1923. he gave us the words j struck by the courage\u2014the courage of a Michael warrior\u2014with which through which the festival of the Epiphany could be shaped anew; he put before us the developing revelations of the Karma lectures,and during the agricultural course at Koberwite, at ^^itsun, 1924, When at the beginning of September he returned from England, a the words which made possible the founding of a Christian festival large and interestingly composed audience had gathered atDomach, f o r t h e s u m m e r s o l s t i c e . f u l l o f i n t e n s e e x p e c t a t i o n .

When we seventy lectures, each of them bringing in the most concentratedasked for a course on the Apocalypse of St. John, he agreed with ! form so much that was absolutely new , inspiring fresh beginnings: spontaneous enthusiasm. The ideal of concrete co-operation so that what was given in these days alone contains substance andb^een the specialised movements, especially between teachers, tasks enough for working on through many decades, doctors and priests, shone before us, too, with a fresh light. Dr. The overwhelming character of this pregnant development is Steiner made an immediate contribution to this by letting individual something that we priests of the Christian Community experienced, members of the circle of priests take part as guests in the medical day by day, in a particularly denite way.

We were able,too, to speak to him several times about questions concerned with the leadership of our movement. He recommended us to com plete our constitution by instituting the ofl&ce of Erzoberlenker (head of the movement), and when we asked him to take part himself in the ceremony of institution, he said that he had limited himself consistently until then to advice and help, without intervening actively in what must be done entirely by us, on our responsibility. But since we specically asked him, he would thisrimp. make an exception and himself take a direct part. And so we could x the place and the time of the ceremony with him. But it was indeed the abundance of a farewell, in which we had been allowed to share. Immediately after the last address, like a testament, which he was able to give on the eve of Michaelmas Day by summoning the remnant of his physical forces once more, illness laid him on the bed of suffering, which six months later became his deathbed. Concerning our ceremony, he sent a message that he would arrange everything for us, so that we could full what was necessary without him within the circle of priests. But we replied that since we had his agreement to take part, which was so important for us, we would prefer to wait until his health was sufciently restored. Some months passed, during which from all parts of the world anxious hearts sent their hopeful thoughts towards Domach. Rudolf Steiner continued his work for his pupils and for humanity through the apocalyptic, guiding letters on the \" Michael Mystery .\" In the second half of February, 1925,1 was able to be for some days in Domach, and through Dr . Guenther Wachsmuth, who belonged to the V orstand at the Goetheanum and was the leader ofthe scientic section of the School, put to Dr. Steiner some questions which had arisen in our work. When he learned of my presence he sent me a message, that I must not leave until I had received what he wished to give me. Two days later I held in my hands the sheets on which he had written the text of the ceremony that was to ba held. I received at the same time the proposal that for the fullment of this we should call the circle of priests together in Berlin on the day before the conference that we were about to hold there. The destiny that spoke in this last sign of Dr. Steiner's concern moved us deeply, particularly as we were bound to feel, in the xing of a date so near at hand, the breath of urgent time. On the 24th of Febmary, Frau Marie Steiner and Dr. Guenther Wachsmuth were present in Berlin at our ceremony as representa tives of Rudolf Steiner. The thoughts which we sent to the sickbed at Domach were carried by acute anxiety; but inasmuch as thegreateist thankfulness was united with it for all that we had receivedfrom and through Dr. Steiner, and were still receiving, die radiant spirit-form shone out before us, which showed him to us as the Herald commissioned by Christ Himself. Dr. Wachsmuth relates that on the next day, when he had retumed to Domach, he had at once to report, and Dr. Steiner was deeply moved by the account given him.A few weeks later came the incomprehensible news of his death. Never can those who watched during those days and nights by his bedside under the tall statue of the Christ, and who were present as Dr. Rittelmeyer held the burial service at the open coflin, and Albert Steffen spoke of the \" Friend of God and Leader of Man kind\", forget the earnest, clear reflection of the spirit upon the countenance of Rudolf Steiner. From then on we experienced our task and oiur mission all the more strongly as one that was accompanied and aided by higher powers. Translated by A. B. 3435E X P E E U E N C E S I N T H E R E A L M O F DRAMATIC ART Gottfried Haass-Berkow * W H E N I r e c a l l t h e i n s p i r i n g s u g g e s t i o n s g i v e n b y R u d o l f S t e i n e rfor dramatic art. they are inseparably bound up for me with the utilisation of them on the stage. A paiater who wanted to show what Rudolf Steiner's indications had meant for him would pCThaps paint a landscape; and what they have meant for me I can best express in word and gesture. For just as what Steiner has said about colour should give to the pictures of a painter a mark of genuine creation, so should everything that an actor has received from him come to view m the creative power of the actor's mime and in the vitality of his speaking. It is not possible for me simply to record that Rudolf Steiner spoke on several occasions in such and such terms on the subject of dramatic performance, and that he did this or that action or gesture in such and such a way. And if I am, notwithstanding, to make the attempt to put something down in writing of what an actor who knew Rudolf Steiner owes to impulses that came from him, then the reader must be asked to bear this in mmd as he reads. With this reservation, I can assure him that it not only gives me great happiness to report on my experiences, but I am sensible of an inner obligation to do so, since what we were privileged to receive has too great a signicance for our whole culture and civilisation for us to suffer it to be lost During the course of many years I had opportunities to put questions personally to RudoK Steiner , and there were also questionsthat I put to him together with various members of the company I was leading at the time; and the answers to all these questions are not at all widely known. The treatment of problems in dramatic art does not of course admit of explanation simply in words, for everything depends on making the prescribed exercises live forimmoHiatft experience, and on demonstrating conclusively that what has been said can be made fruitful in persistent practice. I should perhaps begin by speaking briefly of myself, so. that my readers may know on to what kind of ground the seed fell. Acting has been my vocation ever since my eighteenth year, whenI begau my career in Austria. Four years later , prompted by the desire to explore new ways of cultural development, I entered the Jacques Dalcroze Institute for Rhythmical Gymnastics at Dresden-Hellerau. Having gained a T eacher's Diploma at Professor Eduard Engel's School in Dresden for V oice and Speech Production, I wentafterwards to Berlin and had an appointment there as teacher in * With regret we have to record that Herr Haass-Berkow died last summer.the Dramatic School run by Max Reinhardt and Maria Moissi. It was in Berlin that I rst heard Rudolf Steiner lecture, and took part in the rst lessons that were given there in the new art of Eurythmy which he had created. Li the smnmer of 1912 I was present at the performance of his Mystery Plays in Munich. At Christmas I was given the role of Herod in the Oberufer Christmas Plays which Rudolf Steiner produced in the AnthroposopMcal Group in Berlin. At that time medieval Christmas Plays were quite imknown; we owe it to Rudolf Steiner that people's attention was drawn to them, and that to-day they are produced everywhere. When at the beginning of the war the dramatic schools were closed, I asked Rudolf Steiner's permission to produce these plays, and the texts were sent to me. At rst I worked at them with some students of Gottingen University; we took ^o other foDc plays, such as, for example, the Totentanz (Dance of the Dead) which I had put together out of fteenth-century texts. Some of my readers may still remember it. In 19101 formed a permanent company, andfor many years we continued to give performances in a munber of towns in Germany and also abroad. For this we extended our repertoire to include dramas by standard authors. The 'Haass-Berkow Players' met with a warm welcome from young and old. In 1921, diuing the days of a Hochschulkurs in Domach, we put oiu: questions to RudoU Steiner, and his answers to them have since been published in a book entitled Uber die Schauspielkunst. Three years later he gave, at the request of myself and others, the course of lectures called Sprachgestaltung und Dramatische Kunst, which has also appeared in print^ At the conclusion of the course, we\u2014that is, my company and I\u2014^were vouchsafed the opportunity to ^ve a little demonstration of our stage work, after which Rudolf Steiner spoke to us, giving us what proved to be his last suggestions and advice for our work. This was almost immediately before he was taken ill. Later on, after Rudolf Steiner's death, an intensive study of speech was begun in the section for the Arts of Speech and Music at the Goetheanum, imder the guidance of Frau Marie Steiner. This was in the summer of 1925, and the study was continued for many years from the summer of 1926 onward. During this time a group of students was handed over to me by Frau Steiner for speech training. Quite a number of my actors remained on afterwa^s in Domach, while I myself accepted an offer to undertake the leader ship of the Wurtternberg Landesbiihne. So much for my own career, in so far as it has immediate con nection with Rudolf Steiner and the Goetheanum. If now to-day, thirty years after Steiner gave his lectures on dramatic art, we want to face up to the question of where we are 1 An English translation will appear shortly. 36 37with the art of acting, I would like in the rst place to quote from an article by the actor Ernst Ginsberg, which appeared in Novem ber, 1954, in the Deutsche Zeitung: \"There is no denying it, the theatre is completely impoverished to-day. A zealous loyalty to his work in all its detail demands from the actor such a mastery of his craft as is hardly to be met with in our time. . . . Artistic standards are sadly lacking to-day. . . . One would like to say to the young actors:' Do take pains to learn once more how to breathe and how to speak! Study to be equal to all kinds of style in speaking, so that, for example, you are ready to speak with masterly skill classical passages which physically require you to hold the breath for a long time, and spiritually to sustain the mood through out\u2014instead of tearing it up into naturalistic shreds' . . . We should encourage actors much more than we do to work out of their own imagination.\" The present situation in regard to stage speaking was described at about the same time by the Darmstadt stage manager Rudolf Seller, one of the leading producers of our day. \" We cannot but have serioiis anxiety for the very existence of the theatre. The consolidation of the theatres by means of regulated dependence on the State has no sensible foundation .... The kernel of all the problems concerned with form and style is the relation of the actorto speech ... We must nd new methods of working that will put the performer in his right place . . . Compared with thetheatre of olden times, our theatre is to an extreme degree a 'personal' theatre, a theatre of imitation, a theatte of the 'type'.The actor in playing his part plays at the same time himself . . . Bent on producing a picture that is true to nature, he lets the word lose exactness and precision. The theatre must be born again out of speech. Will it ever succeed in bringing into this everyday kind of acting the ordering and dignifying power of speech?\" Rudolf Steiner has answered these questions. Thirty years have gone by since he pointed to new paths for the development of dramaand opened up possibilities for that spiritual deepening of the art for which men are waiting to-day. We must, however, be prepared to nd that the paths of development here implied are paths that each one has to discover\u2014and tread and make fertile\u2014for himself. We must also realise that any report of the answers Rudolf Steiner gave to the questions we brought to him could carry conviction only if at the same time it were possible to demonstrate them practically. All that I can attempt to do is to draw for you in writing an utterly inadequate kind of sketch, intended to suggest how such exercises can prove fruitful for an actor. And for this purpose I would like to single out two themes: rst, consciouscreative activity on the stage; and, secondly , the interconnection of gesture and word. * * \u00bb *On the occasion of the Hochschulkurs of 1921, we asked Rudolf i Steiner: 'How is consciousness related to dramatic activity?' He 1 replied as follows: 'Dramatic activity has a very special part to1 play in that enhancement of consciousness towards which man is I moving in the present time. Again and again, in widely differingspheres of life, we hear it emphatically declared that this develop- I ment of consciousness cannot but rob the artist of some measmeof his naivete and instinct. The faculty of immediate and vital perception, however, will most assuredly not be lost by such know- ledge as we aie pursuing here. One need have no fear of becoming1 inartistic through acquiring conscious control of one's medium . . . For mankind in general, and more especially for the artist, the process of becoming conscious is a necessity .' These words I myself, along with many others who have travelled the same road, can fully conrm. Rudolf Steiner went on to say that Shakespeare had to a remarkable degree the faculty of beholding the characters of his plays. He could see them standingbefore him in imagination as objective pictures, and it enabled him to creep right inside them and know them from within. This faculty of the dramatist must, said Rudolf Steiner, extend to the actor. That is to say, particular care should be taken during his training to develop it. And now Rudolf Steiner gave us an example for the development of consciousness which, as we try to follow it with sympathy and imderstanding, does indeed awaken within us the forces that can be creative in the realm of drama. He quoted to us the following words of the well-known Vienna actor Lewinski, one of our foremost 'character' actors. When questioned about his relationship to his art, Lewinski said:' I would of course simply not be able to play at all if I were to depend upon the little hunchbacked gure standing there on the stage, with his croaking voice and frightfully ugly face; he could never do anything! I help myself out of the difculty in the following way. On the stage I am composed of three persons. The rst is the little hunchback. The second is compJetely outside this hunchbacked gure, and leads a purely ideal existence; but I must have him there before me all the time. Finally, I myself creep out of both of these and am the third, who plays with thesecond upon the first\u2014upon the hunchbacked Lewinski.' One might perhaps say , expressing it a little differently , that the artistic ally creative ego (No. 3) plays, with the imagined gure of his part (No. 2), upon the instrument of his body (No. 1). This division of' oneself into three, said Rudolf Steiner. has great signicance for the I actor in all his work on the stage. Rudolf Steiner emphasised also how necessary it is for the actor to know his body, before he can be ready to play upon it as on an instrument. 'He should have as thorough a knowledge of his body as the violinist has of his violin. He must come to the point of being able to listen to his own voice. He should also 3839know how he steps, how he places the sole of his foot in walking, how he moves his feet and legs, and so on.' The actor will, in fact, make an intensive study of how people walk; he will leam the secret of different kinds of walking. He will observe that inconsiderate people walk on their heels\u2014^which corresponds to the gesture for K; or again that the more pleasant and agreeable person has an easy, flowing gait, which corresponds to the gesture for L. He will practise rapid walking, and then a mere shuflaing along; or again, swaying to and fro as he walks, and then once more stepping out rm and straight. He will do best to practise especially the kind of walking that comes least naturally to him. If in a student we call into play merely what he brings with him by natural endowment, it will mean that we hold him fast in naturalistic acting\u2014a. procedure that is only too common in the film world. And it is a fact that even many stage producers, under the con taminating influence of the lm, are tending to cast their parts onthis principle. If, on the other hand, an actor's work is not restricted in this way to suit his more natural talents and disposition, he can develop such an alert ability for change that he can be perpetually turning into someone else. By submerging himself in many Cerent 'imagined' characters, he acquires a rich store of possibilities of expression. Such an actor we shall want to see again and again, for on account of his unbounded versatility he will always remain interesting; whereas we shall soon tire of one who is for ever show ing us what comes easiest to him. In naturalistic actinjg the actor is a prisoner; in fantasy he is free to change all the time. 'The actor should know whettier he has himself a quiet walk or a quick, smart step\u2014^in ordinary life as well as on the stage; he should know how he bends his knee, how he moves his hands.' With these words Rudolf Steiner touched as early as in 1921 on the theme of the fundamental nuances of movement\u2014a theme he expounded in greater detail in &e Drama Course, showing their relation to the gymnastics of Greece. \"The actor,' he said, 'should make the experiment of trying to behold hiniself\u2014in daily life as well aswhilst he is studying his part. In this way he becomes able to stand right within the role he is playing.' Once, when present at a rehearsal, I shut my eyes in order to be able to concentrate better, and found that I could hear from the way in which the actors were speaking what movements they were making; I could hear\u2014without seeing\u2014when their muscles were taut and when relaxed. My own experience is that the more I resolve myself into the movements of my part, gliding into its very being and becoming identied with it, the nearer do I come to iinHftTigtanHing what the ait of mime really is. Observation of life is of incomparable value for the actor. Imitation of life in its external appearance leads to naturalism; imitation, on the other hand, of the foHD that is beheld in imagination leads to style. I would like to give you here two examples of how a cry ofhorror or dismay, which as a rule is rendered naturalistically on the Stage, is lifted by a poet to the level of style. He accomphshes this by using the material that is given him in speech\u2014^rhythm, choice of sounds, alUteration, assonance, repetition, enhancement and so on. The rst example is from the chorus in Schiller's Die Braut von /' i Notice, among other things, how d (or t) occurs seven times in the verse. The second is from Goethe's Pandora. Epimeleia takes refuge beneath her father's cloak from the axe of the jealous Phileros: 'Ail Weill Wehmirl mii! mh! Welti Ail Ai mirl Wehl' Many actors are completely at a loss how to render such passages. I once asked Rudolf Steiner how spiritual science could help one to understand the art of acting better. He did not reply at once, but a few days later said somewhat as follows: 'Try one evening to build up a clear pictme of some monologue or short scene. See the picture there before you. You will need to hold it there for about ve minutes, no more. Next morning try to see it all backwards, to see it as a continuous series of pictures in the reverse order. This is a very good exercise, for it will mean you are no longer boxmd to the thread of the thought' We all know what a dream is like, how it speaks to us in pictures. By means of such an exercise some part that we have to play is similarly con verted into pictures. Gradually you nd youKelf becoming com pletely at home in the part; you are caught up into the fantasy of itGesture and word come alive for you, a dynamic makes itself felt in their antitheses, and you grow conscious of enhancements and of varying tempos not noticed before. In ne, you become able to do yom: acting out of the picture that you have there objectively before you. Liberated from yourself, you begin to have positive joy in playing your role. Practice in this exercise takes one right away from any expression of self in the acting, right away too from naturahsm, and teaches one to present the part objectively. When formed on the stage in this objective manner, even a cruel scene will win applause from the audience for its art, whereas the very same scene performed naturalistically and subjectively will arouse only abhorrence and disgust. On the subject of the quick response of movement to tone and tone to movement, which can lead us to appreciate the close inter- working of gesture and word, Rudolf Steiner said: 'If you want to 1 Woe, woe to the murderer, woe. Who sowed for himself the fatal seed!' (From Act III, Scene 5).represent human life artistically, try gradually to begin to notice that when, for example, you have a sentence to say that has an emotional quaUty, or again one that tends in the direction of sadness or distress, or when perhaps you have to scold someone\u2014then on each single occasion you can feel that an absolutely denite move ment of the body, and also a denite kind of slowness or quickness of speaking, belong to that sentence.' Let me quote a few examples, although when they are written down, instead of being livingly demonstrated, they can give but a poor idea of the matter. Suppose we have the words: 'I've a perfect passion for skittles!' Let us ima^e the situation. We arein a skittles-alley. A skittles devotee is standing there with the ball in his hand, and behind him are his comrades in the game. He takes careful aim at the skittles at the other end of the alley and unally sets the ball running. 'All nine!' shouts the boy in charge of the skittles. The man is delighted and calls out; I've a perfect passion for skittles!'\u2014and goes off into a whole series of movements. The thing is done! From the sentence we have dis covered ttie movements that belong to it. Take another sentence: 'I am very sad!' I drop on to a chair and let my arms and legs droop. In this position, arms and legs hanging loose, I say the words: ' I am very sad!' The situation inwhich I nd myself has to reveal to me the movement that ts the words; and then in the posture into which the movement brings meI nd the ri^t dynamic for the speaking of the words. One more example. A peasant woman, so runs the text, has to say to her naughty little girl:' You dirty little snuffller! You stupid, good-for-nothing child! Have you anything to say for yourself?/'// give it you!' It comes so natural to the mother, seeing before her this impudent httle daughter of hers screaming and howling, to say: 'You dirty little snuler!' and then to add in a hard, repellent tone: 'Stupid, good-for-nothing child!', and then withhands raised threateningly and in a voice trembling with annoyance to put the question to her:' Have you anything to say for yourself?' Pause. The woman holds her clenched sts tight on to her sides and with the words Til give it you!' treats her daughter to a smart box on the ears. There you have a succession of different move ments, each in turn giving its particular nuance to the words. And now we can go further and look at the relation between tone and movement from the opposite direction. Rudolf Steiner said: 'You should nd a certain pleasure in moving your legs and arms, enjoying the movements simply as movements. Then, when you are studying, you should feel: The movement t am making at this moment calls for this tone of voice\u2014another one for that other tone of voice.' Let us take an example. I am drumming on the table with my ngers, I am getting nervous. The sentence will form itself in a tone to correspond: \"He's not here yet\\\" With these words I am in the movement I am making with my hands. 42Or, I balance up and down on my toes, shrugging my shoulders. I shall then nd myself saying with the corresponding modulation of voice: \" Well, well, after all, there's nothing to be done. He'll come all right. Let's wait a little longer.\" There are many other kinds of sentences one could take. But always the modulation and dynamic of the speaking will have to correspond with the movements. Two or more actors could makea game of it, one making the movement, and another having to nd the right modulation of the voice. In this way one would arrive, without conscious design, at the recitation of a dramatic text by a separate reciter (the actor having then to nd the corresponding movements)\u2014a plan advocated by Rudolf Steiner again and again as an exercise of no little importance. In this way the actor becomes thoroughly at home in the whole play of movements, and learns also to nd in the movements the right way to form his sentences. Through the mouth of Hamlet, Shakespeare gives playersinstructions how to perform. It is interesting to compare these instructions with what Rudolf Steiner has given for the study of word and gesture. Hamlet says to the players: ' Suit the action to the word, the word to the action.' The rst part of this advice is followed when the actor who is telling or describing elucidates and reinforces the word by his movements\u2014as it were in picture; and the second when the dramatic action is the prominent factor. Take an example of this. You walk with quick resolute steps to an open door, shut it rmly and say in a threatening voice &at goes well with your movements: There! Now the door is shut and you can't get out!' Or, you take hold of the door handle gently, close the door with care, and your words have instead a reassuring ring:' There now, the door is shut, and nothing can happen to you!' Rudolf Steiner's indications on the subject of gesture and move ment could well be followed up by experimenting, for example, with a well-known painting. Hold up before a circle of young players and students a picture, let us say The Deluge of Michelangelo, and cast the various parts. Each student will then proceed to make careful and exact inspection of the gure he is to present. After about ve minutes the picture is taken away, so that the gures remain only in the memory. And now let the actors take up their positions in the group as they saw them in the picture. Then sayto them:' ITie flood is rising higher still, the danger is increasing, the little island on which you are taking refuge will soon be submerged!' At once all their gestures and mime are intensied. You then call on them to stay perfectly still, as they are. And now you have a picture absolutely in the style of Michelangelo, and so striking thatit could well serve as a motif for a painter or sculptor. The actors feel this muscular tension by means of their ' movement' sense.^ 1 Rudolf Steiner describes man as having twelve senses. By means of this one he * senses' his own movements. 43In a little while you indicate that the flood is subsiding. A feeling as of deliverance passes over the group; in one and another , perhaps, it nds utterance in speech. Again you call a halt; andonce more you have an impressive picture\u2014altogether new and astonishingly lifelike. Experiments of this nature can be carried outwith pictures by every variety of painter, and also with sculptures by Rodin, for instance, or Barlach. The actors learn what it means to live in imagined gures that they themselves have rst to create out of the roles allotted to them\u2014they learn to live in these figures and to take cognizance of themselves in all the different kinds of style that the pictures provide. Participation in such an exercisewill also help to develop the faculty for imitation of forms one Ms oneself created out of imagination, in contradistinction to imitation of life in the world outside. When asked what steps one should take in order to acq^e a thorough grasp of a new role and make intimate contact with it,Rudolf Steiner made a special i\u00bbint of the interpretation of thedrama as a whole through a preliminap^ reading rehearsal. This, he said, is a great help for the forming of the ensemble. The various characters will then become alive in all manner of ways for the imagination of the actors. He laid particular emphasis on Ae fact that if the actors have rst found their way together into tte piece as a whole, they will come more easily to an understandingof their individual parts than they do when each studies his own part alone for himself\u2014or when, as used really to happen in the days of ' written parts', the actor knows nothing of the play excepthis own part, bit by bit! * * * * What should happen with all exercises\u2014as experience will show\u2014is that a new instinct should mature out of them. They must become second nature in the student\u2014a complete matter of habit. They must never remain at the stage of being regarded as a lesson, or as a rule to be followed. In a lecture given in 1909 on The Nature and Origin of the Arts, Rudolf Steiner spoke of how the art of mime proceeds from mans 'movement' sense, which he described as the sensation we experience when we move the limbs or members of our own organism In th year 1921 1 asked for exercises that would developthis sense. The reply was: 'Y es, they can't be given all at once, but I will look into the matter. Thinp of this kind, if they are to be of use, have to be worked out slowly and objectively, and no less so because they have their foundation in spiritual knowledge. I will make a note of the question and give an answer later on.' The answer came three years afterwards in the Drama Course.Rudolf Steiner pointed there to the gymnastics of the Greeks as a rst foundation for the actor . Since the experiences th^ese gym nastics afford, both external and inward, we fundamental, we wiU now proceed to consider them in some detail. 44In running, leaping, westling, throwing the discus, throwing the spear, the will that resides in the limbs expresses itself in its total relationship with the surrounding world and thereby brings to expression also the fundamental properties of stage speaking.' Theessential mime movements or gestures that belong to the stage were designated by Rudolf Steiner as 'shadow-sketches' of the ve gymnastic activities of the Greeks. T aking our start from stage speaking, we nd, he said, that stage speaking should have the following properties: 'It should be able to be effective, and also thoughtful; it should be able to feel its way forward in face ofhindrances, to show an antipathy that repudiates, to show a sym pathy that gives reassurance; and nally it should be able to expressa withdrawal into oneself or on to one's own ground. These properties of speech readily lend themselves to association withcertain gestures, and the gestures again give rise to corresponding nuances in the speaking.' Thus in these six fundamental shades of expression in speech the actor has starting points for his artistic performance, much as the painter has in the fundamental colours, or the musician in the scales. The 'movement' sense\u2014the sense, that is, of one's own move ment\u2014is too little developed in man to-day. If it were in active use, how many and manifold discoveries it would lead to in life!In order to throw fresh light on these vitally important exercises, I would like now to give you some examples, taken from classical authors as well as from daily life. 1. 'The effectiveness of speech can be studied in connection with the \"pointing\" gestmre arid renders the word incisive.' The well-known words from Julius Ccesar afford a good example: ' Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!' When the pointing gesture is made that corresponds to the sentence, then the gesture itself produces the incisively spoken word. 2. 'In thoughtful speech the inner processes of the soul are seeking revelation. The gesture will be a holding on to oneself,and the word will be fully formed.' Take the sentence in Schiller's Wallenstein: ' Solch ein Moment wars, als Nacht GedankenvoU an einem Baum gelehnt, Hinaus sah in die Ebene.^ i 1 Wallensteins Tod, Act 2, Scene 3. The whole passage in S. T. Coleridge's translation reads * There exist moments in the life of man, When he is nearer the great Soul of the world Than is man's custom, and possesses freely The power of questioning his destiny. And such a moment 'twas when in the night Before the action in the plains of Liitzen, Leaning against a tree, thoughts crowding thoughts, I look'd out far upon the ominous plain.' 45You will see how in the sentence itself the gesture is already indicated\u2014' leaning against a treeIt is a sentence that is called up out of memory and requires to be fuUy intoned, every consonantdistinctly uttered and making its contribution to the picture. Orwe could take something that happens in the soul, in the realm of feehng. 'Terrible!' Even as I say the word, I shut my eyes tight. And once more, this close holding on to oneself leadsto a full intonation of the word. Or suppose you are chang insidewith pent-up anger . Y ou will perhaps clench your sts and plantthem rmly on your hips, and for action administer a box on the ears which you will thoroughly enjoy , pouring the enjoyment into the words: 'There now! I've paid him out!' A further nuance of this property of speech manifests in an inability to come to a decision: ' This expresses itself in the limbs being held still, and in a long-drawn-out manner of speaking.' Repeated questions directed to someone who is disconcerted or upsetwill perhaps evoke for answer nothing but a continual drawling murmur. This last is a nuancethat was not so much in evidence thirty years ago as it is to-day! 3. 'The feeling forward in face of hindrances. This property of speech is to be studied in the forward-rolling movement one makes with arms and hands, producing a trembling or vibrating in the word.' Such a manner of speaking may occur in a question, or in an expression of doubt, or again in a wish. Romeo is standing beneath Juliet's balcony , where she is seen leaning her cheek on h e r h a n d . . . . Romeo : O, that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek! 4_ ' The rejecting in a mood of antipathy is to be studied in the flinging forth of the limbs; it gives a hard tone to the voice.' T ake the opening words of Faust:' Habe nun, ' The expression of trust and condence in a mood of sym pathy manifests in a reaching out to touch the object, and the speaking becomes thereby gentle.' Faust: ' O sahst du, voller Mondenschein, Zum letzten Mai auf meine Pein P 2 Note with what artistic feeling Goethe lets the sound O \u2014so characteristic of sympathy\u2014come three times in the verse. 1 ' I have studied, alas! Philosophy, And Jurisprudence, and Medicine too, And saddest of all. Theology, With ardent labour, through and through! (Trans, by Latham.) 2 ' Full-orbdd Moon, would thou didst shine Thy last upon this pain of mine !'6. ' The withdrawal of man into himself comes to expression in the thrusting forth of a limb that has rst been held closely to the body. And this results in a short, abrupt manner of speech.' Takethe last words of a dialogue in the poem of C. F. Meyer entitled Die Fiisse am Feuer: * M e i n \u2014 i s t d i e R a c h e \u2014 r e d e t G o t t , ^ i Everything that is brought to revelation in speech is comprised, said Rudolf Steiner, within these nuances: and one should make a thorough study of one's sentences in the typical gestures, in order to come at last to a natural and easy forming of gesture\u2014^for word, for sentence, and even for the whole character that one is playing. Rudolf Steiner pointed also to further\u2014^and quite astonishing\u2014 results that can follow from the practice of the gymnastic exercises. 'In running,' he said, 'one practises stage walking.' We shall readily recognise that walking on the stage is not a thing we can do as a matter of course. In running, the foot is called into action just where it is most mobile\u2014that is, in the front. The whole foot is more easily guided from there; the step is best begun and nished from the fore-part of the foot. Moreover, from running one leams to walk so that the walking articulates the word. Down to one's very toes, one goes right into speaking, into the sounds, and learns how to work at them so as to develop them in full clarity. In ordinary life many people will set their feet moving when they want to bring their thoughts or their speech into flow. Any walking or running, but especially rhythmical running, will make itself felt in the ' feet' of the verse, in the run and flow of the language. Another exercise that belongs here is writing with the feet. It is indeed true of this exercise, as Rudolf Steiner said: 'Man begins then to feel his own organism, and that is an incalculable gain for the soul.' 'Through the practice of leaping, one learns instinctively to modify one's walking\u2014^making it now slower, now quicker, to suit the character of the word.' Leaping also helps one to acquire readiness and vivacity in expressing one's thought, and a quick 1 ' Vengeance is mine\u2014saith God.'

One becomes much more sensitive to the manifold nuances in speech and simply unable to tolerate a uniform, colourless dialogue that has no life in it. ' In wrestling, we leam instinctively what hand and arm move ments to make while speaking.' The will goes here into the move ments of the arms, goes into the hands, into the ngertips. We sense what our opponent is intending to do, and in our dealings with him, in our careful \" feeling\" and \" touching \" of him, in the play of forces between ourselves and him, we learn to feel ourselves\u2014down to the feet in one direction and up to the head and the senses in the other. Alternate tension and relaxation; the mood that is all alert for action; pregnant pauses; echoes that linger on afterwards\u2014all these we experience in wrestling; in short, we leam how to speak dialogue!' In discus-throwing, the eye learns to x its gaze exactly in the direction of the throw and then to follow steadily the path of the thrown object (ball of some kind, or a little stone), to watch care fully also the movement of the hand\u2014and from all this we leam the play of mime, the control of the muscles in mime, and moreover the \"look\" in the eye.' 'We are laid hold of by the object,' says Graf Fritz vOn Bothmer (who was chosen by Rudolf Steiner to be the rst teacher of gymnastics in the ori^nal Waldorf School). Beginning from the. eye, from the gaze in the eye, our whole organism feels itself caught up by the object. We can well under stand that by means of such an exercise a thorough inner training of Soul and body can be achieved. And it is also interesting to experience how by means of discus-throwing speech is loosened,and the speaker is then taken hold of by the dynamic of the imme diate sentence, so that each sentence\u2014and this applies especially to dialogue\u2014^receives its own particular movement. T ake, for example, the sentence: 'Look! There's a bird flying over the eld!' The one who calls out these words is caught up by the movement of the flying bird; he has escaped from the prison of his subjective self.His speaking is right outside him; it is out there in the realm of the air. 'In spear-throwing, we learn the very foundation of all speech\u2014 namely , that it shall not come about as an expression of thought,but purely as speech. For speech is by this exercise drawn away from the intellect and enters into the speech organs and into the forming of them.' Fritz von Bothmer sums it up in the words: Inthe thrdwing of the spear, man masters the object' The lifting of the spear for the throw will have its effect upon the inbreathing; the aiming of the spear will have its effect upon the holding of the breath; and then this right holding and measuring of the breath will have its effect upon the sentences, upon many sentences, upon 48a whole play. The actual throw goes together with a full out- breathing. Through this exercise one gains mastery of the breath ing process and of its use in speaking, and also of the mutual relation of the sentences, one with another. Many experiences afforded by archery as practised in the Eastern Zen art are here conrmed, although there the approach is from an entirely different standpoint. The professional actor can only be amazed\u2014and filled at the same time with deepest gratitude\u2014when he experiences again and again what love and what intensity of insight Rudolf Steiner brought to the whole domain of dramatic art. If the art of acting is studied and practised and developed further in his spirit, then it will be possible for the ideal that Rudolf Steiner himself set up for it to nd fullment. Dramatic art, he said, should be 'a necessary addition to every human existence worthy of the name'. Translated by M. A.HOW THE WALDORF SCHOOL AROSE F R O M T H E T H R E E F O L D S O C I A L MOVEMENT Herbert Hahn 'THE Free Waldorf School was founded in Stuttgart in the year 1 1919, hence at a time of abysmal darkness in Middle European history; and it yielded the rst gleam of light for a completely new paA. Some words in Goethe's Fairy Tale hold good for this time of the birth of a new art of education: \" One alone can do but litfle, but he can avail who in the right hour imites his strength with many others.\" But in saying that these words hold good, I must make one reservation. It was indeed the right hour, and many united their efforts. But the essential help carne from one indi vidual\u2014^Rudolf Steiner. When, on the foundation of the energy and initiative of another of whom we shall be speaking, he called the Waldorf School into being, a cycle embracing some 150 years was brought to completion in the cultural history of Germany. For Rudolf Steiner gave the guiding principles of this new art of education in the midst of the storms and crises of a vigorous current in social life which called itself the \" Movement for the Threefold Social Organism.\" The importance of this Movement can be truly assessed only by recalling ideas and impulses that were astir at the end of the 18th century, but were destined to be covered with a layer of wintry snow.Here we must think, rst and foremost, of the young Schiller, whose medical studies at the Karlsschule in Stuttgart culminated in the writing of two treatises. One\u2014it has survived as no inore than a fragment\u2014was called Philosophy of Physiology , the other. On the Connection between the Animal and the Spiritual Nature in Man. Both treatises represent a new and signicant germinating impulse in Schiller's life, a beginning that was not to nd fullment until much later. For within a pronounced dualistic tendency, prone to antitheses in thinking and in style, they represent an urge, sometimes more tentative, sometimes more violent, towards a mird,as yet unknown, principle. In the rst of the two writings Schilleris seeking, more from physiological aspects, for an intermediary force. In the second treatise the essential quality of precisely whatis to constitute the link between the animal and the spmtual nature in man remains undened; it is summoned forth with a certain inner audacity . This seeking and probing, this challenging sum- 50mons, are not only a signicant prelude to the whole of Schiller's life-story; they are of interest also for the history of cultural development For an essential part of the development of Western culture, from before the beginning of the second Christian millennium and even earlier, is dualistic through and through. In his whole existence, his whole path of destiny, and in his struggle between necessity and freedom, man is involved in opposing principles.Tom hither and thither between body and soid, he stands per petually before the abyss yawning between the world and God,between this side and the \"Beyond\". True, the light of modem Westem consciousness is kindled by these opposing principles, but flie soul is impoverished in respect of its deeper, creative talents, and with the gradually increasing dominance of a material culture is drawn into slavery. The soul becomes a prisoner of the body. It was therefore a moment of evident importance when in his maturer years Schiller tumed again to the theme he had set himself ,in his youth merely as a prelude, and brought it into denite shape. This was when he wrote his Letters on the /Esthetic Education of Man. Tlirou^ a remarkable chain of circumstances, the basic droughts in these Letters were conceived in Stuttgart.In this work, where Schiller's thought reaches a peak, a three fold membering of man's inner life is shown to arise out of two contrasting functions which partly merge into a third and party press on to new creative activity. Schiller speaks, to begin with,of two urges: the lurge of reason through which a place is aligned to man among the form-giving forces of the world of spirit; and the urge of matter, through which nature, in the abundance of her prodigious but at the same time unseeing life, breaks in upon him.If a man follows one of these two mrges only, he cannot be truly free. Indeed, saturation in the one will usually throw him, enfeebled and devoid of will-power, into the clutches of the other. This holds good both for the span of an individual human life and for the successive stages of humanity. With regard to what man can achieve in the way of self- development and the education of others, Schiller strives, therefore,to nd a third state. He calls this the \"aesthetic\" state. Here he perceives the sway of a third urge, an artistic urge which he callsthe \" play impulse \" (Spieltrieb). As this play-impulse unfolds and takes effect, the warm surge of life continues to flow in from the side of nature, but it is divested of its blind, importunate violence; the form-giving impulse coming down from the side of the spirit spreads abroad its benecent clarity but loses all inflexibility, everyelement of compulsion. And so, in thus making himself free, man becomes for the rst time Man in the fullest sense of the word. In the child at play, in the artist at his creative work, in the man absorbed in contemplating a real work of art, Schiller recog nised the signs of this true manhood. And he is led to aSrm: 51\"For to say it once and for all, man plays only when in the full sense in his Philosophy of Physiology, in the form of mere fragmfenfe, of the word he is a man, and he is wholly Man only when he is had been enriched by his new psychological insights and voiced in playing.\" And in another passage; \" It would be expedient to terms of a more comprehensive physiology, the material basisremove the former (the natural character) still farther from matter would have been provided for the Threefold principle actually and to bring the latter (the moral character) somewhat nearer to it\u2014 expounded in the Letters. so as to create a third character which, related to these other two\u2014 Because Schiller, dying all too early, was unable to carry his the physical and the moral\u2014might pave the way for a transition work through to that stage, his most important spiritual impulses from the sway of mere force to the rules of law, and, without remained without the bodily vehicle demanded by the age. And impeding the development of the moral character, might serve so, tragically swept aside by the dominating tendencies of the newrather as a sensible pledge of a divine morality as yet unseen.\" century, they sank into an enchanted sleep. What Schiller established through his clear mental grasp of this They became active again when the young Rudolf Steiner third sphere in man cannot be valued too highly. He sets free the brought them to life during his student years in Vienna and primal forces of the life of soul by not allowing the soul to be i endowed them with a quite new freshness and energy.

But even thenforward, conscious of itself. At the threshold of an age which he regretted that Schiller's treatment of them soared too far into under the pall of an increasingly supercial civilisation was bound abstraction. On the other hand, he was charmed with the artistic to bring in its train an enfeeblement of the fe of soul, his aim was portrayal of the same realities in Goethe's Fairy Tale. Whatever to rouse the soul to stronger and purer activity. metamorphoses these germinating thou^ts might undergo, the Did Schiller also divine in advance many things that the coming basic motif of threefold man was there and could not be submerged, phase of evolution would inevitably bring ?

This was the fate of the ; processes is provided entirely by observation of nerve-processes,b^ic thoughts voiced by Schiller in the Letters. True, in these In the exposition given by Rudolf Steiner m 1917, feeling and will thoughts he had paved the way for the Threefold perception, but are, it is true, presented as organicaUy^ed wth thi^ing, but asthis was purely in the psychological domain. If the thoughts expressed self-centred, autonomous functions. The physiological correlate offeeling is said to be the \" life-rh)^thm\" centred in, and connected with, the breathing process. And now Rudolf Steiner shows that the rhjrthm of the breath must be followed \"to the outermost peripheral parts of the organism.\" In a similar way he shows that willing is based upon processes of metabolism, the ramicationsof which are to be observed over the whole organism. Through these new conceptions\u2014^which are indicated here in a very elementary way and on the subject of which a great deal of literature has meanwhile been produced\u2014the nerves-and-senses system, with its centres situated mainly in the human head, ceases to be the most important instrument for the life of soul. The whole body becomes the instrument of the soul-and-spirit And this comes about, not through a static departmentalisation of particular functions, but through a dynamic process which playsinto the whole organism from each of the three autonomous spheres, and which in its wonderful interplay of functions, mutually attuned to one another, rst makes possible the phenomenon of human life. Rudolf Steiner was fully alive to the fact that before complete conrmation of his views could be reached, physiolo^cal data would have to be followed up in a direction that is still an un familiar one to-day. This realisation, however, did not detract from the inner certainty and exactitude of his spiritual-scientic concepts. A further aspect of the threefold nature of man presented by Rudolf Steiner in the same chapter of the book. Riddles of the Soul, is of far-reaching signicance. He points to the different levels at -which thinking, feeling and willing lie in the eld of him^ con sciousness. Man is fully awake only in his life of thinking; in feeling he reaches merely the intensity of dream; while even during the waking life of day, willing takes its course in that deeply obscured state of consciousness into which our whole being passes during sleep. We shall see later how these seemingly simple prin ciples became fruitful to an undreamed of extent. On the physiological side, however, to which the young Sc^er had been able to point only tentatively, the clear light of conscious ness now illumined the presentation of threefold man. By integra tion into the bodily, organic functions, by emancipation from the purely psychical\u2014^by this means the spiritual was for the first timegiven full scope for activity . It was this conception of threefoldtnan that alone had every prospect of becoming fruitful in the 20th century, notably for education. But this particular fruit had to wait for two more years. The impulse of the Threefold perception was rst to take effect in aquite different direction. It led Rudolf Steiner to a diagnosis, asprofound as it was all-embracing, of the present state of the^ social organism. Here again there is a remarkable parallelism with the life and work of Schiller. For Schiller, too, the recognition of the Threefold principle, even though rudimentary, had become an 54instrument for diagnosing the great social problems of the time. It enabled him to make predictions, astoundingly denite and all too soon to be conrmed, of the denouement of the French Revolution. Rudolf Steiner's diagnosis was of a quite different order: it pointed simultaneously to the great remedy for which the age was seeking. Amid the forebodings of a catastrophic outcome of the rst World War that were already stirring in the heart of Exurope, he appeared\u2014^first in small circles and then before the public\u2014as the bringer of new, far-reaching knowledge. The essenceof this was that just as the threefold nature was laid into the human being by Divine Powers, and is a reality, it behoves men to-day to carry into effect a Threefold principle that is at present only latent in the social organism. He saw the devastating catastrophe of the times approaching from the side of the single, separate States that had crystallised out of the commonwealth of peoples as a whole. The vista before Dr. Steiner was that of the unitary States, incited by their traditional but narrow interests, clashing with one anotWin defence of egoistic economic interests of every kind and of forms of culture in reality fossilised and outworn. Through its inventions and discoveries the age has created a new picture of the earth; in the forming of this picture\u2014and its detailed elaboration\u2014man has acquired a new consciousness. Just as he himself, if he rightly understands his own being, is torn out of the old, static conditions into new, dynamic ones, so, through the world-wide expansion of trade, modern society has grown out of patriarchal forms of economy towards the problems of a global economy. This global economy tends everywhere towards emancipation from the tutelage of the State. In order to have a true economic character, it strives for autonomous forms which wiU develop on associative lines. One of the three principles of the modem social organism is delineated here.. Another will consist in a spiritual life deriving substance, impetus and configuration out of its own sources\u2014^which can only be sources of freedom. The creative impulses which, even in administrative matters, will impart to the spiritual life forms that are in keeping with the status of man who has now become a self- conscious and independent being, must be given freedom. Schools and institutions for higher education, the religious life, art and science\u2014these can thrive only in the airs of freedom. They need the support and guarantee of the State for the maintenance of their rights; but they can and must dispense with the tutelage of theState. Rudolf Steiner saw the third member of the social organism in an Equity State, a life of Rights, in which, following the principle of equality applied in aU its ramications, every citizen has an active and fuUy responsible share. It is of the essence of this Threefold Social Order that, as with the human being himself, it admits no rigid separation or loss of contact between the three spheres. Just as all the three orgaic functions are united and work together in one and the same human 55being, so in the Threefold Social Order man himself is the binding unit One and the same man can, as a citizen with equal rights, rely upon the democratic observance of those rights; he can do thiswMe at the same time he thinks and acts as an industrialist far beyond the boimdaries of his country in association with others; and, acting ever and again out of the wholeness of his being in a free spiritual life, he can give effect to the impulses of his indi viduality side by side with the other men\u2014^sometimes different men, sometimes the same men whom he meets in the other spheres. Even while the rst World War was still being waged, Rudolf Steiner summarised these basic thoughts in memoranda which were in the hands of the Cabinet in Vienna and also of government circles in Berlin. How much could have been done to solve the problems of Austro-Hungarian relations if, in accordance with the principle of a free spiritual life, it had been decided to concede fullciiltural autonomy to the thirteen nations of the Danubian monarchy! And what new prospects there could have been for the peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, where Rudolf Steiner's memorandumwas also available! Among other things, the whole absurdity of small nations each having its own separate economy could have been avoided; the seeds of the second World War were nurtured within the border States, right up to the Baltic, from the very fct day these States and their \"national economies\" came into exist ence ! But ears in Vienna were as deaf as were those in Berlin or Brest-Litovsk. The rst World War came to its tragic end. Under the ruins it left behind, the re of the second catastrophic World War was akeady smouldering. * * * * In the Spring of 1919 Rudolf Steiner drew up his basic thou^ts on the Threefold Social Organism in a terse, concise form, making a powerful appeal to the conscience of Middle Europe in his Call to the German People and to the Civilized World. In the Mme year his fundamental book on the Threefold Social Order had beenpublished: The Kernel of the Social Question in the Life-Necessities of the Present and Future.* I cannot regard it as chance that Rudolf Steiner's Call to the German People was sent to me from Stuttgart by a friend there. I received it in Westphalia in strange circumstances of lite.As a military interpreter witih the rank of sub^tem, I was engaged at that time on affairs connected with the winding-up of a large hospitd previously used for prisoners of war. Together with afriend who was later on a colleague in the educational movement, I read the lucid, monumental sentences in which Rudolf Sterner * Published in England as The Threefold Commonwealth.outlines the destiny of Middle Europe from 1871 until the end of the rst World War. These thoughts struck into our conscience like sparks of re. Young as we were, we were not able to assess their importance to the full; but we glimpsed something of the historic signicance of the moment. My Mend had not yet seen Rudolf Steiner, and I felt that this was the right time to tell him about my earlier meetings with this absolutely unique personality. All the desolate dreariness that had oppressed us in the barracks and their surroundings, like a fog, was dispersed. A ray of sun from the wide imiverse had penetrated to us; we felt it as a ray of sun coming from the future. The accompanying letter written by my Mend in Stuttgart men tioned a name hitiierto unknown to me\u2014^that of the indusMalist Emil Molt, director of the Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory and also one of the leading gures in the Treuhandgesellschaft Goetheanum (Goetheanum Trust). My friend wrote that he knew Molt weU and that he was one of a circle of men in Stuttgart who were \" preparing something of great importance.\" It was not clear to me from the letter just what this \"something\" was, but in the mood induced by the reading of the Call, I immediately had faith in it The name of Molt had already passed from my mind when, a few weeks later, it was vividly recalled to my memory. Through my friend in Stuttgart, again, I was asked, to my astonishment to go there for an interview with Emil Molt. There was a plan that I should take over work connected with projects set on foot by the Movement for the Threefold Social Order. In Stuttgart, Emil Molt gave me more detailed information about the task in mind for me: I was to take over the direction and arrangement of educational courses for workers, to be given in as weU as outside the Waldorf-Astoria factory. My heart-beats quickened at the prospect of this new and fascinating task which gave my life some real meaning once more. I undertook it gladly: chiefly out of condence in Rudolf Steiner, but also out of condence which arose, almost instantaneously, in Emil Molt. I found in him an unusual and happy blend of qualities not readily combined in one person. He gave evidence of a cleM and practical mind together with great warmth of heart; his will was impulsive, impetuous\u2014^but any particular action was always performed with great calmness and after deep deliberation. When T began this new work there was no taUc as yet of the founding of a school. As weU as brief lectures on social andeducational matters given to workers in the various departments of the factory during fuUy paid, half-hour intervals, and a few fore'gn language courses for members of the staff, my work included some educational help to the workers' children. In the afternoons I helped about forty of these children with their home-work. Theywere a haphazard little company, drawn from all the eightelementary school grades in Stuttgart. Later on I saw nearly all of them again in the lowest classes of the Waldorf School. At that time, when I helped them quite without any system or guiding educational principles, it would never have occtirred to anyone to imagine that they represented something Uke a beginning of therst set of Waldorf School pupils. The new tasks were therefore very varied and left me little free time. But such hours as were free were taken up with intensive study of the Threefold Social Order and with earnest discussions often lasting far into the night There was an unforgettable atmosphere of enthusiasm and expectancy, both tense and fruitful.We were waiting for the day when Rudolf Steiner himself would come to Stuttgart. Before this happened, voices which in retrospect seem full of signicance had become audible among the workers at the Waldorf-Astoria. One heard it said: \"Yes, it is really a splendid thing for us older people to have these courses and lectures\u2014^but it comes a bit late. Our children should have something of the kind! They ought to be able to nd in a school something that was denied tous when we were young.\" It is of importance, historically , to realise that these thoughts arising in the hearts and minds of the Waldorf- Astoria workers during the period of the Threefold Commonwealth activities became one of the spiritual factors in the subsequent foundation of the Waldorf School. But it is certainly no less important to realise that the workershad the courage and desire to express thoughts such as these only because the same thoughts had already been harboured for ^ long time by Emil Molt. And this is the point at which to think of the unique relationship existing between Emil Molt and the workersand staff of his factory. On the one side it was a relationship of fatherly care. One would have to write at length to convey what itsignied in the human sense when Molt passed on his daily roundsthrough the rooms in the factory . In good Swabian dialect he was called the \"Vatter\" (father). Only the other day I heard that during the war he had provided a cow in order that some workerswhose health was gravely endangered could get extra nourishment. But Emil Molt's relationship with the workers was not merelyone of fatherly solicitude\u2014by no means so rare m Swabian in dustrial life at that time. For years he had carried in his heart me thoughts of Rudolf Steiner . Above aU, he was vitaUy interestedin Rudolf Steiner's lectures on social matters and on education. Through rigorous and indefatigable self-education. Molt had setabout closing the gaps in his own schooling, and mis helped to givehim a ready ear for me educational problems of the time. In earlydays he had read Rudolf Steiner's book. The Education of theChild from the Standpoint of Spiritual little volime compiled from shorthand reports of lectures. I^s book ^eludedme following words: \"Spiritual Science, when called upon to buildup an art of education, will be able to indicate in detail all me mings mat come into consideration here, even specifying particularforms of food and nourishment. For it is realism, it is a ming for life itself; it is by no means grey meory\u2014as it might appear to be to-day according to me mistaken conceptions of many meosophists.\" When called upon to build up an art of education. ... Thousands must have read mis passage, but mey had overlooked its importance. It had not dawned upon mem that in reality this was a challenge to put a question\u2014a question for which the spiritual scientist, as an undeviating guardian of human freedom, is obliged to wait. Deep down in Emil Molt's soul this passage worked on unceasingly. And when the catastrophe of 1918/19 befell, hedivined that in reality it was a catastrophe due to faulty and neglected education. Education would have to be given a new basis. This insight led to lively consultations and discussions with representatives of his workers and staff, and to the organisation ofthe educational courses for workers. They were a rst step, behind which lay far more man Emil Molt himself at rst realised. This unexpressed \"more\" was to be stimulated into great activity when Rudolf Steiner was able for a short time to free himseff from his manifold obligations in Dornach, and came to Stuttgart. For Stuttgart and Wurttemberg this was the beginning of me classic period of work in connection with me Threefold Commonweaim Movement. Its effects spread far into the omer provinces of Middle Europe. One of its most unforgettable and also most effective preludes was me lecture on me Threefold Social Order given by Rudolf Steiner in the so-called Tobacco Room of the Waldorf-Astoria Factory to all its employees. T h e a c t i v e w o r k e r s i n t h e T h r e e f o l d C o m m o n w e a i m M o v e m e n t had been awaiting this lecture wim tense excitement, and it was therefore all me more disconcerting to nd mat to the rst part of w h a t R u d o l f S t e i n e r s a i d t h e w o r k e r s l i s t e n e d w i t h o b v i o u s r e s e r v e . I still remember well how near I myself was to giving way to a certain feeling of disappointment. But men, from a side mat could not have been foreseen, came the break-mrough. After speaking by way of introduction of certain other great motifs of contemporary history, Rudolf Steiner went on to characterise the basic mood and frame of mind of me proletariat. He laid bare its deeper, spiritual origin by presenting it as the direct consequence of a catastrophe in the whole of Western cultural development. Millions of young people, he said, are wrested away every year at about the age of 14 from me real process of cultural development and are thrust into economic and industrial life in one form or anomer. True, in most countries mey receive furmer training\u2014this means that they are given technical instruction, wim as much essential theory as mey require. But they get no education mat is worthy of the name. And it is mis realisation of inadequate, curtailed cultural development that embitters me souls of me pro-letarians to their very depths; it is this that induces them to rebel against the existing forms of civilisation. Here, deep in the human heart, lies a permanent crater of smouldering revolutions. \"All of you sitting here,\" said Rudolf Steiner, \"from the 16-year-old girl apprentice to the 60-year-old workers, are suffering from the fact that your real cultural development was obstructed, because from a certain moment onwards there was for you only the hard schooling of life, but no school in the true sense of the word.\" This was said with such warmth and came from such a profound understanding of human nature that it struck right into the hearts of the listeners. All at once it was no longer the great sociologist and philosopher, introduced by Emil Molt, who stood there; it wm a doctor who with clear perception, but also with a delicate, sensi tive touch, was uncovering a wound he wanted to heal. All prejudices which had risen up at the beginning were swept away as if by a magic hand. Every one of us present experienced in common tide liberating and at the same time challenging power of a truth uttered by a man who knew. A body of mere listeners became, in the best sense of the word, a gathering of human beings in whom something began to stir\u2014^the resolve to help to prevent the cultural development of man from being further obstructed at such a critical moment of time. In the middle of a lecture on the Three fold Social Order the vista of a wholly new kind of education was opened up. Mindful of the fact that this would never have coine into existence, but for the workers' decisive wish for it, it is this hour that I should like to name as that of the actual birth of the Free Waldorf School. At this point I must speak particularly of one man who had no connection whatever with the Waldorf-Astoria Factory, but had listened to this lecture with keen interest. He was E. A. Karl Stockmeyer, who played an essential part in the birth of the newschool. Stockmeyer, who at that time was still teaching at a High School in Baden, had been acquainted both with Rudolf Steiner as a personality and with his teachings from the early days. By dint of strict mental discipline, he had mastered the fundamental prin ciples and method of anthroposophical Spiritual Science. A strong,innate urge for research and inquiry had led him not to adopt a purely conservative attitude to Spiritual Science, but to developand elaborate certain aspects of it, in particular that of philosophy applied to the theory of knowledge. Hence his personahty wasmarked by a refreshing independence and rm inner poise. It was just this type of man that Rudolf Steiner particularly valued a m o n g h i s p u p i l s . . , ^ ^After the end of the first World War\u2014indeed, even before that\u2014 Stockmeyer had been occupied in his own way with plans forschool reform. Finding in Stockmeyerts ideas something that tamed with his own inner aims, Emil Molt had persuaded him to come to Stuttgart and was engaged in lively discussions with him. This 60exchange of ideas had to do not only with education but also\u2014aswas only natural in view of the whole situation\u2014with the principles of the Threefold Social Order in general, of which Stockmeyer had an excellent understanding. And so not only did he become an important collaborator in the founding of the Waldorf School; the untiring activity in the planning of the social work at that timecannot be imagined without the presence of his striking personality . It was on April 25th, 1919, in the very late evening, that the decisive discussion about the founding of the Free Waldorf School took place. Rudolf Steiner, after giving a great public lecture to the employees of the Daimler Works, had come to the house in the Landhausstrasse belonging to the Stuttgart Group of the Anthro posophical Society , where he was accustomed to stay during hisvisits to Stuttgart. Emil Molt, Karl Stockmeyer and I were waiting for him there. The basic ideas put forward by Rudolf Steiner in the ensuing conversation on the subject of the new school varied in many details from what was eventually embodied in the constitution of the Waldorf School. But the whole talk, both in its substance and inits tenor , was a source of veritable inspiration. Rudolf Steiner very soon threw off the last traces of the tremendous strain that had preceded the conversation. What he had to say to us flowed with increasing eloquence and vigour . And it was connected not onlywith the concrete plan for the founding of the Waldorf School, but also with social and cultural education in the widest sense. I shall speak here of three motifs which to my mind form a basic and essential part of that conversation. Among other questions, I asked Rudolf Steiner from which point one would have to start in order to lay the foundation of genuine social feeling in the communal life of men. Although Ae question in this form was very general and vague,he went into it wUlingly. He said that one could naturally speak for hours about such an all-embracing domain. On the other hand, the matters that came into consideration could also be expressed quite simply. And then he went on to speak of the threefold natureof man, of the different degrees of intensity in which thinking, feeling and willing work in human consciousness: thinking alone is fully wide-awake, feeling has the intensity only of a dream, andwilling rises as if out of a condition of deep sleep. Our cultural life (2)in its present form could have been produced only by clear, wide awake thinking. This has brought man a clear-cut, vivid realisation of his own personahty. It has individualised but also \"de-socialised\" him: it has torn him out of the natural connections of social life. In its intrinsic nature our ordinary conceptual thinking is anti social\u2014^Rudolf Steiner underlined this. \"You may hold great congresses,\" he said, \" where the deliberations from start to nishare concerned only with social questions, but as long as the approach is a merely intellectual one, the effect of such congresses 61upon sodal life will be nil. They will tend far rather to disintegrate i t \" . \"Thft true social life.\" he went on, \"must be built up out of those deeper strata of consciousness which are Ae reahm of the dreaming feeling and the sleeping will. Artistic capacities and faculties, which are identical with the primal forces of the religious life, must be summoned into activity\u2014^but not in such a way that the clarity of consciousness in the man of the modem age is ignored. If that were to happen, it would be at the cost of human freedom. Clear, independent thinking must not be sacriced in order to setin flow the process of social reform. But this thinking must imbue itself with new substance coming from deeper strata of the life of soul.\" Rudolf Steiner went on to say that there is a method and a way whereby the foundations of social feeling may be laid. Theabstractness of human thinking has led to far-reaching differentiation and specialisation in the labour process; it alone has made possible the technique of modem industrialism. But at the sametime it has also removed the worker from the wider relationships in which he originally felt healthy and whole. He can experience himself now only as a part of a part, and what he produces only asthe splinter of the part of a part. T ogether with the n^owing of his eld of work, his consciousness has n^owed. The formermust be accepted as a fact bound up with mod^ mdustrml methods: the latter, as an evil that is not inevitable, must be overcome. ,. , At this point I looked at Rudolf Steiner very dubiously . T^e possibility that the essentiaUy proletarian attitude could ever beovercome in the consciousness of the proletariat seemed to me to b o r d e r o n t h e m i r a c u l o u s . . . . . As always, he perceived the eagemess of the question arising in the heart of one who was taking part in the conversation, and he spoke with all the greater emphasis. The essential thing\u2014he saia^in effect\u2014was to create for every worker and employee a pictureof the whole of his work and also of its place and setting in toe world. ]^~started with the situation as it was in the Waldorf-Astoria Factory. All the employees, male and female, toould be told aboutall toe work done in toe other departments. They should ^so beg i v e n a p i c t u r e o f t h e t o b a c c o p l a n t i t s e l f , o f t o e r e g i o n s w h e r e i tis cultivated, of the civilisation in the countries concemed. Oyera n d a b o v e t h i s t h e y s h o u l d b e t o l d a b o u t t h e w h o l e P ^ ^ s s o f t o ed i s t r i b u t i o n o f t h e n i s h e d p r o d u c t a n d t o e e c o n o m i c a n d n a n m ^factors involved. Similarly , toe salesmen should be made conversant with all the practical work that had gone into toe nishedp r o d u c t W h e n a n y o n e w h o i s e n g a g e d o n s o m e p r o d u c t i v e w o r khas a picture of the whole process involved his conscioi^ness iswidened and his human interest kindled. He may_ continue hiswork in the narrowest of sections, but he feels spiritually Imkedwith all toe others. The social connection then becomes real to him and toe feeling of detachment is no longer there. Rudolf Steiner thought that this widening of consciousness might be achieved by means of lectures and introductory courses. Something like a syllabus of production should be worked out foreach industrial rm. He also had in mind that individual workers might be invited to visit other departments of a factory; toey could go rst as observers and later on be given opportunities for practical participation.From the point of view of social history, it is important to underline that these things were said by Rudolf Steiner in April, 1919\u2014hence very shortly after toe end of toe first World War\u2014andthat in the very same year they were being put into actual practice in the Waldorf-Astoria Factory. As toe result of toe overpowering pressure of bigoted counter-interests, working now from oneside and now from another , toey were soon suppressed in Central Europe\u2014^to appear once again after toe second World War as an alleged \" new impulse \" from beyond the seas. It may perhaps be a cause of surprise that matters of this kind gured in a talk concerned primarily with the creation of a newschool. But what was so characteristic of conversations with Rudolf Steiner was that he never kept systematically, let alone pedantically, to a set topic, but took hold of what came to him atthe moment from the vital interests of those taking part I recall a third motif in this conversation\u2014to toe effect that it was now important to build a bridge from one people to another by means of a folk-psychology based upon spiritual realities. Rudolf Steiner regarded instruction in foreign languages, particularly in the so-called modem languages, as a way to this. Every language, he said, preserves quite denite conceptions of beings and toings, and these conceptions come to expression in images, in pictures. It would be important, together with toe foreign language itself, to convey such pictures and words to toe children and young people.Rudoff Steiner called them \"linguistic values.\" He then spoke of the lectm-e-course on folk-psychology he had given in toe smnmer of 1910 at the Nobelhaus in Oslo: The Mission of Individual Folk- Souls in connection with Germanic and Norse Mythology. While referring to these lectures he became deeply earnest He said:\" The intention behind these toings was that if rightly understood, they might have been able to help to prevent the catastrophe of toe World War. But there were no ears to hear. . . .\" And then he spoke of how he had recently sent a copy of toe Oslo lecture-course, with a commentary of his own, to Prince Max of Baden, toe eminent German statesman, in toe hope that toe German Government of the day would allow itself to be enriched by new ideas, by a new eld of knowledge. And with unforgettable pain, he said: \"But there were no ears to hear. People did not want to hear, and so the catastrophe befell.\"We sat silent, and there was a pause. With a strong, solemn emphasis on every word. Rudolf Steiner concluded: \"Far worse catastrophes will follow the present one if ears continue to be deaf to these things.\" I have spoken at length about these three motifs of the con versation because they only seem to lie outside the sphere of Waldorf School education. Anyone who studies the latter thor oughly will be astonished to nd that each of these motifs is mo^ intimately connected with the principles and practices of Waldorf Schools. And so here. too. we have an illustration of how Waldorf School education was bom out of the great diagnosis of the age and of civilisation made by Rudolf Steiner at the beginning of the Threefold Commonwealth Movement. \u00bb * * \u00ab From April until August. 1919. the preparations for the founding of the new school went forward in their own way. To begin with, the organising and explanatory work connected with the social-economic sphere of the Threefold Commonwealth was in the fore ground. The courage and the re, the intense devotion with whichRudolf Steiner endeavoured in lectures and discussion evenings to show how the great social demands of the time could be met left unforgettable impressions. ^ .Without having rested, and exhausted by conversations tlmt might have taken up the whole of the preceding night, and toen byconferences lasting from morning until evening, he would come into the lecture-room\u2014sometimes a dreary hall in a factory , some times a tavern. The listeners, most of them indusMal workers, sat with their mugs full of beer and cider in front of them. Smokeminalinff with the fumes of the drinks soon penetrated mto eve^ comer of the room. This affected the vocal chords and made speaking very difcult for Rudolf Steiner. who had been a non- smoker and a non-drinker for decades. His voice, never known to be other than full and resonant, was often completely hoarse at the beginning of the lectures. But with wonderful strength and self- m^tery he got the better of this. too. I was never present at a discussion-evening when, even if it took half an hour, he did not nally succeed in getting his voice clear .He also had the wonderful art of responding to the idiosyncrasies of every audience. Here. too. his profound and mstantaneous understanding of men\u2014but equally, I believe, his human love-came to expression. He did not press any^ing ready-made upon his listeners, but developed his thou^ts as it were out of their own experiences and insight, their own sufferings and joys. Hence one always felt free while listening to him. even when he spoke withintense re. And in these gatherings, where the problems of com m u n i t y w e r e b e i n g d i s c u s s e d , o n e f e l t c h a l l e n g e d a s a s m g l e p e r s o n . as an individual. In the discussions with the workers, with their strong partyafliations, the great difculty of contending with ingrained pre judices and dogmas was soon apparent. Again and again tiiey spoke of their hopes, seldom of their achievements. Phrases such as \"if the Threefold Order is introduced\" were constantly to be heard. On such occasions Rudolf Steiner would cry out with a voice of re that no human being could \" introduce \" tiie Threefold Order; that it behoved everyone to work with untiring personal activity in order that what was everywhere being prepared in thewomb of the times should gradually come to birth. A strange and grotesque objection, shedding garish light upon the attitude of many minds, was prone to crop up: \"Yes\u2014^but if the Threefold Order becomes a reality, there will be no longer any class war. . . .\" This was usually Said with an undertone of i^o- found re^et\u2014as if humanity would be deprived of something valuable tf class war were to cease! There were others again who took exception to the fact that Rudolf Steiner gave no sweeping denitions and also refrained from presenting detailed programmes. People had grown too accustomed to bald catchwords, aggressive epigrams, and so-called \"burning protests.\" I remember how a worthy speaker in a discussiontaxed Rudolf Steiner with making statements that were as \"mushy as a plum \". Rudolf Steiner bore this remark, as well as previous utterances, with the greatest equanimity and composure; he merely jotted down one or two words in his notebook. Then he answered the various points briefly, in order. When the objection just men tioned was reached, he spoke to the following effect: \" One Of the respected speakers complains that my remarks were as mushy as a plum. What am I to say to that, gentlemen? Perhaps that I have always tried to be very exact in observing nature. So I think, too. that the plum should also be observed very carefully. And then I nd that soft plums are juicy, sweet and ripe, but hard plums are tasteless, unripe and . . .\" He did not get as far m the obvious word \"indigestible\" because the large audience broke into delighted applause. The \"respected speaker\" had been dealt with in thekindliest way, and the sympathy of the listeners made them more receptive to all that was said on Ais occasion. On another occasion he turned aside a compliment that seemed to him too cheap; it was always his habit to reject admiration in any form. The chief engineer of a big rm came out with thewords: \"Yes. Herr Doktor. it is because you are such a great philosopher that you have these important things to say about overcoming the crisis in our civilisation!\" Rudolf Steiner answered dryly: \"Philosophy has little to do with these things. If I am ableto contribute anything useful to-day, I ascribe it primarily to the fact that from my earliest youth I leamt to clean my own shoes!\" TTie kernel of an \" Industrial Council\" took shape in Stuttgart at that time as the outcome of countless meetings, consultations and discussions. Rudolf Steiner considered that in an area of the size 64 65of Wiirttemberg it would be possible to carry out the experiment of an industrial economy based on associations. A munber of speakers travelled all over the region at that time in order to make known the contents of the book on the \"kernel of the social question\", which had meanwhile been published. I myself was one of these speakers, and I well remember an evening at the Mauser Works in Obemdorf. After particularly animated and even heated discussions, the endeavour to persuade the Board of this enterprise to link up with the General Council in Stuttgart had succeeded. I had already realised that my remarksthat evening were being strongly supported by a man I took to be a skilled worker or a foreman. When the meeting was over this man came up to me and told me that many years before he had attended courses and lectures by Rudolf Steiner under the auspices of Liebknecht's Workers' Educational Institute in Berlin. \"We workmen liked listening to him,\" he said, \"for what he told us was so entirely different from what the other speakers said. Among ourselves we often said, 'Something great will come from Dr. Steiner one day. . . . ' And so this evening I was particularly happy. I believe that what we surmised then has now been fullled!\" Rudolf Steiner laughed when a few days later I told him of this episode. But he was also obviously pleased that such an enthusiastic witness still survived from those years which had been for him a period of hard spiritual struggle. ^at he experienced in those weeks and months of practical activity in connection with the Threefold Order was not always so encouraging. He saw with great anxiety that these great and helpful ideas had to be presented by people who were very far from being up to the tasks devolving upon them at the decisive moment. With the wide-minded, cordial\u2014and at the same time utterly un compromising\u2014sincerity that was innate in him, he would talk ^gain and again with the individual speakers.One day I said to him that it depressed me to be faced at such an early age with a task of this importance; I was afraid I was totally inadequate for it. He looked at me kindly, saying withwarm emphasis: \"Y es, but you may also be sure that^e spiritual world accepts enthusiasm as a substitute for maturity.\" In the economic and political eld, the whole period here under review did not full the hopes cherished by the pioneers of the Threefold Commonwealth Movement. Already in the year 1919 reactionary cmrents began to assert themselves everywhere. Hide-bound thinking and dogmatism won the day. It was as Rudolf Steiner had said immediately after the war, with grave, profoundly sorrowful emphasis: men had not learnt how to learn!And so under the pressure of dark powers of opposition, the \"Industrial Council\" which had represented a new seed in the economic eld was crushed before the end of the year. What remained was the consciousness that valuable seeds had been scat- 66tered abroad and that a group of men had exercised and steeled their forces in a struggle which for the present had no prospect of success. But who can say whether, after all, a great deal more had not been accomplished ? Many a lightly sounded theme seems to die out in history, thereafter to form the leading motif in a future age. The question remains whether, when he inaugurated a social movement of such promise, Rudolf Steiner knew that it was destined to have so little immediate success. From the reports 1 had of many things he said, mostly in personal conversations, 1 can onlyassume that he foresaw exactly the course things would take. All the more worthy of admiration was the indomitable enthusiasm he showed in the many activities of the movement, the way he had of presenting things as being so urgent that there was not a moment to lose, as if they ought to happen the next day. Not until years afterwards did 1 hear of illuminating words of his\u2014that there are \"prematurities\" in history. Thev occtir of necessity, in order to die like grains of wheat out of which good,' fertile seed is to grow. Extreme renunciation is demanded of those who are the human bearers of these \"prematurities''\u2014^renxmciation that is not resignation but the silent soul of an activity enhanced to the utmost. And so a life that is dedicated to them is necessarily a life of heroism. With this inner attitude, hardly perceptible in outward app^- ance, Rudolf Steiner bore also the wrecking of the attempts which, in the sphere of a free spiritual life, were striving to nd new forms for the autonomous development of culture\u2014attempts to establish a council of culture and similar institutions. In this sphere every- tiiing was wrecked by hide-bound prejudices, by a passivity thathad become a rule of life. One might well be reminded onp again of Fafner's words in Wagner's Ring des Nibelungen: \" 1 lie and I possess, let me sleep!\"The Principal of a High School in Leipzig was, for example, asked one day: \"Surely it would be easy for you, who are so con vinced of the necessity for a free spiritual life, to arouse enthusiasm in yoiur staff for a new kind of collaboration?\" \"My staff?\" the Principal said bitterly. \"What are you thinking about? Apartfrom their teaching, they are interested at the very most in questions of pay and position!\" What was there to be done with sudi a generation of men? , x-Seen against this background, the founding of the Free Waldorf School, upon which all the energies of the movement for the Three fold Social Order were now soon concentrated, becomes an event of real signicance in the social history of our time. \u00bb * \u00bb \u00bb It will be obvious from the foregoing paragraphs that in founding the Free Waldorf School it was not Rudolf Stemer's aim merely to add another school to the good schools, private and modem, already 67existing in Middle Europe. His aim was to build up a real scienceof education, and it was only as a seed bom from a free spiritual life that the Waldorf School interested him. It was not a matter of particxdar reform or of supplementing good existing methods, butof creating a new atmosphere and a new ground for education in the widest sense. Whenever I encountered Rudolf Steiner in those days, with his utterly uncompromising, spiritual resoluteness, Icould not help thinking of an utterance that had come to my knowledge shortly before my arrival in Stuttgart It was a saying of Alfrftd T.ichtwarks. reported to me by Hermann Itschner, the educational reformer, with whom I was in close contact at that time,\"A merelv partial reform of existing conditions does nothing but strengthen the existing tendencies.\"\"^ Already in 1910 an attentive observer of the times might weU have become conscious of a striking contrast which even to-day is not obliterated but has become even stronger. It applies, on the one side, to industry; on the other to the cultural life, partcularly to education. As is apparent everywhere, industry, vigorously carried forward by the spirit of the age, is at least on the way to achieving new forms and conditions of labour. By its very nature industry is progressive, and its pioneers realise quite clearly that humanity is in the throes of a change of consciousness. More insistently, however, than people are willing to admit, cultural life bases itself on forms of thought which in widespread areas of the West do not differ essentially from the spirit of the 18th century. And again, the reason why so much is wanting in Europe^ educa tion is often because only a few perceive that things which in the Middle Ages were unconditionally to be regarded as good, andeven inspired, are working on in a diluted and sterile, but also a tenacious and unyielding form. Rudolf Steiner's aim was to imbue cultural life and education with the progressive forces of the age. It was a question of rousing them out of static rigidity and of leading thetn into the dynamic movement of free, spiritual develop ment That this could be achieved only on absolutely clear, objective foundations was proved by the great introductory course* he gave foi- the College of T eachers of the Waldorf School in August, 1919. In the course of a review of bodily, psychical and spiritual pheno mena, these lectures built up a knowledge of man which affords entirely new starting-points for the education of the child at eachstage of its development. They showed how the principle of ttoee-fold man could be the basis of an educational method genuinely congenial to the child; one which does not persist in applying to achild's early years the categories which are suitable at most for the adult life of soul. . ,. ,. , An atmosphere of festival prevailed dunng this course, which Published in English as The Study of Man. (Rudolf Steiner Publishing Company.) 68was given in three sections: \"General Knowledge of Man,\" were a foretaste of what was to be learnt and experienced later on \"Didactic Methods,\" and \"Educational Practice.\" These lectures in the many conferences led by Rudolf Steiner himself at the Waldorf School. In an age when learning is split into sections, with its branches unrelated to each other, here there was organic universality, embracing the whole scholarship of the times. This great knowledge, permeated with an equally great artistic power, was crowned by an even greater humanism. Here there was no trace of self-consideration or of vanity, no trace of satisfaction in dominating other human beings through the power to convince. One felt\u2014^In humility and as a server this man stands at the great well-springs of spirit which have opened themselves to him; andhe respects and protects every single individuality who comes before him. Rudolf Steiner possessed the rare art of lowering his own greatness to the level of the one to whom he was speaking\u2014not out of condescension, but out of an attitude of human understanding and inquiry. In his presence one breathed freely, even when he was presenting things of the utmost greatness. One felt that one was being addressed in one's own language, and experienced the joy ofan entirely natural converse between man and man. So it was, too, during this course of lectures. One felt conrmed in a hundred things hitherto only surmised; but admittedly one clung to the pleasant dream of having surmised them. Some years afterwards, during a searching study of the lectures heard at &at time, it was easy to realise how alarmingly little one had assimilated at rst. And new perspectives open out every year as the interval of time leng^ens. Y et the sheer enthusiasm with which one listened, with which one participated in the educational practice, was certainly responsible for part of that miracle in the year 1919. Here, too, the words that were said to me in the midstof the struggle to bring the Threefold Social Order to fullment hold good: the spiritual world accepts enthusiasm as a substitute for maturity. On 7th September. 1919. the Free Waldorf School came into being. Tliis day, too, was a festival from mormng until late in the evening. In the house in the Uhlandshohe in Stuttgart, in the former restaurant that had been rebuilt into a school, there was no suitable lecture-hall. So the actual inauguration ceremony took place in the Stadtgarten-Saal; it was opened by Bach's Prelude inC major, played on the piano by Paul Baumann, our rst music teacher. Frau Marie Steiner recited, and children demonstrated certain examples of the young art of Eurhythmy inaugurated by Rudolf Steiner. But the crowning point was Rudolf Steiner's address, in which he characterised once more the great social perspective in which Waldorf School education was now t^ingits rst steps. Science becoming alive, art becoming alive, religion becoming alive\u2014these he declared to be its well-springs. How 69easily these words might be repeated as phrases! The essence of the matter is that for Waldorf School education they have a spiritual, concretely real signicance, down to the very details of practice. In the afternoon the different classes were introduced to their teachers in an atmosphere of happiness and vivacity. In the evening the whole College of Teachers was invited to a performance of Mozart's \"Mamc Jblute.\" Rudolf Steiner, sitting by Jtimil Molt, pointed out to mm with eager alertness where the teachers of the new school were sitting, all over the great Opera House. The delight and childlike joy with which he did this, before the performance began, revealed once again the sweetness of spirit incarnate in this great Friend of Man. Translated by D. O.W I D E N I N G T H E A R T O F H E A L I N G Crete Kirchner-Bockholt W H E N R u d o l f S t e i n e r b e g a n t o g i v e o u t h i s w o r l d - c o n c e p t i o n ,and an ever-widening circle of people gathered round him, there were more and more requests for his advice on possible ways of restoring health and overcoming illness. It goes without saying that a great initiate such as he is also a great healer. He gave advice of this kind very readily, as often as he was asked, and in the early days recommended for the most part old remedies which had come originally from instinctive perceptions; they had been revived by M. E. A. Ritter and tried out upon herself. Later, however, when medical doctors joined the Antkroposophical Move ment, Rudolf Steiner preferred to give his advice to members of the medical profession, starting at the same time to suggest new remedies, or even whole courses of treatment At Domach there was already a little laboratory where vegetable colours were prepared for the paintings in the cupolas of the rst Goetheanum; Dr. Schmiedel now began to prepare medicaments there as well. When in 1920 a considerable number of doctors were gathered together. Dr. Steiner gave them the rst doctors' course. Some of them wanted to found clinics where anthro- posophical knowledge of medicine could nd practical expression.Thus there arose in Stuttgart a Clinical-Therapeutic Institute run by Dr. Palmer, Dr. Friedrich Husemann, Dr. Peipers, Dr. NoU; Dr. Ita Wegman acquired a house in Arlesheim and had it transformed into a modest little Clinic. About this time, in August, 1921,1 too came to Domach. But although I already had my medical degree, my concem was the new art of Euiythmy, as I had the idea of studying Curative Eurythmy later; indeed, I came near to giving up medicine for Eurythmy. Had I known of Eurythmy two years earlier, Ishoidd certainly never have completed my medical exams. I now studied for a year under the tuition of Frau Marie Steiner, who accepted me as a pupil in the kindest way. I made her acquaintance when I had just arrived in Stuttgart and was arranging the chairs in the lecture-room at the house in the Landhausstrasse. She herself proposed that I should learn Eurythmy with a view to practisingCurative Eurythmy, and she invited me to Domach. It was during the period of inflation, and a stay in Switzerland at niy own expense would have been impossible; this generous invitation, coming as it did out of the blue, very much surprised me; I acceptedit with the greatest joy. In order to be able to give at least some practical help in my odd moments, I leamed to type, though I fearI was never much good at it; nevertheless Frau Marie Steiner 70 71comfortingly assured me that the goodwill of others does not as a rule get even as far as that. After a year of training in Eu^thmy I had a talk with Frau Dr. Steiner, telling her how difcult it would be for me to go on as a student and how I craved\u2014after studying medicine for so long and then Eurythmy\u2014at last to have a profession. She listened most sympathetically and proposed that, with Frau Fels, I should direct the newly founded School of Eurythmy at Stuttgart It was a hot. day in summer when this conversation took place in a room behindthe stage in the Schreinerei. Just at this moment, before I had time to reply. Dr. Steiner walked into the room. He gave me his hand and said, emphasising each word, \"Well, Doctor, how are you?\" Nothing more. Yet these words went right home. It is impossible to explain by what means I instantaneously graspedwhat he wished to say. The emphasis on the \"Doctor\", the question spoken so deliberately, the carefully chosen moment\u2014 within me there was no shadow of doubt how his words were to be taken. They were meant to say: \" Shoemaker, stick to your last.\" How the interview with Frau Marie Steiner ended, I no longer remember; in any case nothing was decided, and soon afterwards Dr. Ita Wegman wrote to ask me if I would go as assistant in her Arlesheim Clinic, which had then been running for a year. The head assistant, Frau Dr. Walter, was ill, and Dr. Norbert Glas wanted to start a practice in Vienna. TTiis letter was written in August, 1922. Dr. Steiner was on a lecture-tour in England, Frau Marie Steiner was with him; thus, whether I Uked it or not, I had to make a decision without being able to Consult either of them. At that time we were not in the habit of telephoning all over the world; perhaps it was not even possible. On the other hand, the position in the Clinic allowed of no hesitation. Dr. Wegman was momentarily without a single assistant and had a good number of patients. I therefore went to the Clinic. I had, it is true, to make the condition that I should occasionally attend to the sale of books in the Schreinerei, for I had promised Miss Mackenzie to deputise for her, she too having gone to En^and. When, among the customers to whom I sold Dr. Steiner's lectiure- cycles or books, there were people I had shortly before examined medically, this occasioned some surprise. But it was I who was surprised when one day, as I was trailing along through theSchreinerei with a package of books, I ran across Dr. Steiner. He had just returned from England and he stopped me to say: \"Y ou have been to see Frau X to-day?\" \"Yes, it seems to me that the trouble is so-and-so,\" I answered. Dr. Steiner nodded\u2014-all was right, treatment included. He then turned left into his studio whileI, with my pile of books, continued straight on to Miss Mackenzie's litde room. ... It was then the thou^t rst came to me that I should have told Dr. Steiner about my starting work at the Clinic. \"Dr. Steiner, I have not yet told you that I am working at theClinic now!\" I called after him. As he went on he said something that sounded like, \"Yes, that's good,\" and only afterwards did it occur to me that t^ was no news to him. * * * * There now began a great period of learning. Dr. Steiner often came to see patients at the Clinic and each time his coming was an event. Generally, during these visits. Dr. Walter and I were allowed to be present in Dr. Wegman's little consulting room. Dr. Walter took shorthand notes of what was said, and afterwards we worked out her notes together, so that we still have a copy of the instructions given. Before each of his visits everything was care fully prepared\u2014analyses, results of examinations, all lay ready. Dr. Steiner gave everything the most minute attention. But when he had the patient in front of him, his method was completely different from the traditional one. He looked at the patient with the utmost concentration, his gaze turning towards the various members of the patient's being; for him it was possible to investigate the cause of illness with a clairvoyance that was exact For him, the symptoms were concentrated into a complex of causes which, as a totality, could be easily surveyed; the passage of time became one long present Thus on one occasion he was able to say of a patient, who for years had suffered from eczema, that the cause lay in his having taken poison as a child. At rst the patient wm imable to recall anything, then it came to him suddenly that in about his ninth year at school he had inadvertently swallowed some hydrochloric acid in the laboratory. The ten-year-old cause of the illness had been perceived by Rudolf Steiner in the man fen standing before him. From this it will be readily imderstood thatmost of the ordinary diagnoses fell to the ground; for what revealed itself to perception of this kind was always the picture of a quite special case of a quite special illness. In the light of such knowledgethe treatment was immediately forthcoming. Whereas to-day we describe and determine the typical manifestations of denite ill nesses, which one might say we look ujpon as detached from the person who is suffering from them, this method was completely the reverse. One day we took a patient, a woman, to Dr. Steiner. Her illness had already been diagnosed in other clinics; we a^ed with this diagnosis and considered hers to be a characteristic case of multiple sclerosis. After looking at the patient. Dr. Steiner said that hers was a constitutional weakness of the medulla oblongata, so that the connection between the spinal cord and the central nervous system was disturbed; moreover , this had been aggravated by an accident. On being questioned, the patient said that once in Paris, when she was about eighteen, she had fallen from a tram, but at the time was unaware of my real injuiy. In her twenty- eighth year there had come upon her this illness, which gave a picture of multiple sclerosis. 7273As soon as Dr. Steiner had established the exact state of an illness, he went on to seek the treatment, and we can say that for this the whole world was at his disposal. In his all-embracing survey he looked upon the human being as bom out of the macrocosm and bound up with nature, with plants, minerals, metals. . . . Even if within man the processes are changed, they still show afnity with the corresponding processes in external nature; and in the case of illness the kindred forces of nature can be drawn into the service of healing. For the faculties of knowledge possessed by Rudolf Steiner, the processes of nature were an open book. What he knew was for us young folk positively overwhelming; whether it was a question of minerals, metals widi their countless salts and combinations, or a question of plants, his choice was always sure. From the algae and fungoids, up to the most highly develope/J plants, remedies weretaken from every kingdom. Sometimes he considered it necessary to change the air for a patient. One patient had difculty in waking, and often it was nearly evening before he wais really capable of doing anything. The prescription was that he should wake up in air with a large content of carbon dioxide, so that fe waking process might be intensied precisely through overcoming this difculty. Thus we added carbon dioxide to the air through the keyhole of the patient's room\u2014^no simple process, chiefly on account of oiir having to seize the moment before he began to wake of fs own accord. In any particular treatment there were always varia tions and fresh plans, the details often being carefully given by Dr. Steiner himself\u2014^for example, that a metal should first be reduced to a vaporous condition, in order then to let it settle as a sublimate. There was only one method of healing to which Rudolf Steiner never had recoiurse\u2014^ffie direct use of his own powers, which woidd have been, in a certain sense, magical healing. Certainly for him, who had all the forces of the surrounding world at his disposal in the highest and widest sense, it would have been easy to effect cures by this means. Y et from his knowledge of man's evolution he hadto refrain from such a proceeding as not being in accordance with the age. For him, the highest ideal in our cosmic age was fe struggle for freedom. He had no wish to gure as a healer with phenomenal powers; he wished to found a school; all fe methodsof healing which he gave were capable of being looked into and learnt. It would be quite wrong to imagine that learning under the guidance of such a teacher took its course without many surprisesand questionings of heart. What was shown here in fe way of spiritual revelations and insight into fe being of man often broughtone to the very limits of one's powers of understanding and endur ance. What confronted us in fe way of knowledge concenmg nature and fe cosmos was a unique phenomenon, yet all fe timewe had to struggle with fe question how one's own inadequate self was to attain to such knowledge and capacity . Considering fe charitableness and kindness one knew to bein Rudolf Steiner, his verdicts upon people, too, often came as a surprise. Once when I was treating a patient who was a subtenant in a certain house, I asked Dr. Steiner what had to be done, since fe patient showed no improvement. He replied, \"Yes, it isn't easy to get well if one lives in fe same house as such a poisonous fellow.\" His wisdom always hit fe nail on fe head;there was no sentiment in the sane way he faced up to facts; what he said was the very breath of truth, and because it was so, one lived in an atmosphere of complete condence. It was this condence alone that made it possible to leam in a way which differed so essentially from that of one's university.When we did not understand Rudolf Steiner's instructions, we never rejected them, but made every effort to enhance om powers of understanding; in this way our own activity was stimulated to feutmost. When we were working on our patients in accordance with his directions, either by medical treament. Curative Eurythmy, massage, baths, or anything else, we tried to understand in each case what he had told us about the connection of the various members . of the patient's being and the causes of the illness. If Rudolf Steiner said, \"Here the astral body has not entered fully, do so- and-so,\" we learned from fe very questions that arose in us as we went about our work. We were all fe time sensible of the goading of these questions; thus it was not a taking-in of knowledge in terms of thought, but a learning through fe activity of this inner questioning, which led nally to a process of cognition. In our struggle for fe answers, we had to change ourselves in order to bring to full understanding what was often alien to us; and if after a time we had fe impression that we understood something, un expectedly a light would arise, illuminating whole elds. There w^ one case which occupied my attention for a long time\u2014a. patient who came to us with abdominal and intestinal symptoms. Dr. Steiner said that this man's thoughts were actually poisoning him and prescribed compresses of burdock root. Thisroot contains a quantity of oxalic acid, which always has fe effect of giving fresh life. After a little of this treatment, the patient, who had been looking very dismal, felt better. If this case is understood with all that has to do with it, including the remedy, it can give fe answer to many questions. To leam in this way is possible only when we constantly experience afresh how justied is our unbounded condence in our teacher. How quickly to-day medical books become out of date ! Remedies that to begin with make a great stir often lose their signicance after a few years. Dr. Steiner's recommendations are a lasting treasure of knowledge. I must here put in a word that has to do with Dr. Wegman\u2014 namely, that nofing I have said about leaming holds good for her 74 75I in the gama way. At that time she was already a ripe hmnan being, having had in her work up to then an extraordinary facultyfor entering with her feeling into the very being of Ae patient and into the manifestation of the individual illness; besides which, shehad acquired great medical experience. The way in which she gave her whole soul to each individual case aUowed her to nd the right medicament through what Rudolf Stenier called a power ofmedical Inspiration and Intuition. Naturally, she did not pos^ss his clear vision or his great insight into all the forces of nature, but she could live herself with such intensity into what we might callthe picture of an illness that Dr . Steiner's instructions appeared to her a matter of course. It makes a great difference whether we pass on a recipe to a good cook or to one who has little understanding of the art; thegood cook will know at once what to do and will not ask how tobeat the eggs or brown the butter. . . . Dr. Wegman understoodin lie profoundest sense all that was involved. Out of her deep connection with Rudolf Steiner, which was a matter of destmy, Ita Wegman took her stand, called as she was to found together withhim a new source from which healing was to flow. Out of such inner conditions she was able, after the burning of the rst Goetheanum, to ask him: \" Can we not renew the Mystenes of medicine in a Christian sense?\" As leader of the Medical Section at the Goetheanum, and working in collaboration with Rudolf Steiner, she was destined to make this a reality. \"All that she begins will spring up and blossom,\" he had once said of her. We experienced the full truth of these words in those years of develop ment and growth in the whole of the medical work. An ever- increasing number of patients had to be taken in and carra for,new remedies constantly worked out\u2014;-even if the manufacture of tiiem often made chemists tear their hair . It was my duty at this time to look after the patients in the newly acquired \"Sonnenhof \", and also to give special attention to developing Curative Eurythmy . During the course for doctors in1921 the principles of the new art of therapy were given, and since then Rudolf Steiner had been furthering and completing ms in structions The year I had devoted exclusively to my training m Eurythmy now became an organic part of my destiny . In thetreaWnt of almost every patient there had to be CuraUve Eurythmy , often a trying-out of new suggestions; it was wonderfut o s e e h o w t h e s e s u g g e s t i o n s w e r e a l w a y s m o d i c a t t o n s o f t h e a c t u a lsound-movement, to suit the form of the illness and the patients c a p a c i t y f o r m o v e m e n t . . , t - . . x i . j -For example, spastic children, such as those with Little s disease,had great difculty in making a wide movement became it wast h e n S a t t h e c o n v u l s i o n s s t a r t e d . I w a s a d v i s e d t o l e t t h e m m a k e all movements with the upper arms My pressed ^to carry out the movements only with forearms and hands. Iheneverything went splendidly! Curative Eurythmy was certainly not an art of modied movement alone; each single movement was prescribed with physiological precision as to its effectiveness uponthe existing state of the illness, and thus it became a remedy. Art and medicine\u2014in a sublime union. Dr. Steiner required of us complete absorption in our work; he often trusted in us more than we did in ourselves, and this trust awakened forces. Thus, for example, when I had been practising Curative Eurythmy for a bare two months in the Clinic, a request for a lecture on this subject came to us from England. It seems that Dr. Steiner had recommended me. I made it clear to him that I was not competent, since I had been practising Curative Eurythmy for so short a time and also lacked sufcient command of English. His answer was: \"But you are capable of Curative Eurythmy, and your English can soon be improved.\" Some little time after this I concluded that I ought not to be practising Curative Eurythnay exclusively, but ought to make a greater study of the use of remedies,and I said so to Dr. Steiner. \"Have patience, that will come of itself,\" was his reply, \" but your destiny is Curative Eurythmy.\" This medical work of Rudolf Steiner's, which was something so new, embracing as it did the whole man, aroused in a great number of young students eager questions and intensive searching. It was a way of healing entirely in keeping with their own inner con ception of their calling. But how was it to be leamt ? It was not only a question of adding new methods to those already learnt, butof bringing healing forces to life within one. This was a goal that called for special methods of training and practice. The young doctors sought not merely a deepened knowledge, but inwardly developed powers which could give depth and renewed life to the whole art of doctoring. T o the stammering questions they brought to Dr. Steiner, he gave answers which can be summed up in the words: \" You are seeking to make medicine more human.\" As he always wanted to be sure that everything proceeded concretely from man and was carried through by man, he gave this advice to his questioners: \"Gather together thirty or forty young doctore who think in this way, and I will give you a course of lectures.\" The rst to approach him were the medical students Henk and Maddy van Deventer and Helene van Gmnelius; we in the Clinic took the greatest interest in what would come of this. In January, 1924, in direct connection with the Chnstoas meeting for the founding of the General Anthroposophical Society ,the first course for young doctors was held\u2014the first course within the newly founded Medical Section at the Goetheanum. For the whole day and a great part of the night those attending the course were together , discussing and taking counsel with one another con cerning what Dr . Steiner had said in his lectures. The whole house rang with fresh, enthusiastic voices. Much as I delighted in it all.secretly I was disturbed lest with this extra work we were not doing justice to the patients in the Sonnenhof and Clinic. I conded my fears to Dr. Wegman, and the next day through her received a message from Dr. Steiner that he was glad the Sonnenhof afforded a meeting place for the young doctors; glad too that I was actively engaged with them, lliis is mentioned as one example among many of how he had in mind not only the whole but the individual details of it. Dr. Steiner now appeared in the Clinic almost daily, generally in the morning. And in difcult and acute cases he was ready with his help at any hour. For a time we had with us a little patient of nine suffering from severe asthma. This youngster wentto school at the Goetheanum and was so pleased about everything that he said he was glad to have asthma; otherwise he couldn't have come to Dornach. The asthma improved apace. But one evening\u2014it was his birthday and he had been over-excited by all the love shown him\u2014he had an attack which left him unconscious. We three doctors were busy with him and Dr. Steiner, when tele phoned, came immediately. He stayed at the Clinic the whole night and with the three of us tried to bring the boy back to life.In addition to articial respiration he constantly advised new measures which we tried at once. It was only at 6 o'clock the next morning\u2014^the dawn of an autumn morning was breaking and the window looking east was opened\u2014that we relinquished our efforts; then Rudolf Steiner spoke to us of how it was impossible for the boy to continue his life on earth for reasons which lay in his whole organism. Our work being ended, I offered to bring him coffee, which in his kind way he declined. He went home and was off to Basle station the same morning. He was travelling to Vienna where, in the autumn of 1923, he was to give his lecture-course, \"Anthroposophy and the Human Heart\". Never was he known to spare himself!At times there were very difcult cases which it was necessary to receive because Rudolf Steiner made a point of such patients not going into other hands. I remember a case of mental illness soexacting that it was almost beyond our strength. Rudolf Steiner had promised us help if we were driven to extremities and no longer able to deal with the patient. One evening things arrived at that point; I went to the Schreinerei, where we knew him to be still inhis studio, met at the door a strong young Goetheanum watchman, and asked Dr. Steiner if we might take this friend down with us to the Clinic. He quite agreed, but, in spite of the urgency of the moment, gave us a lesson on always respecting the authority ofothers. He said he had given over the organising of the watch to Dr. Wachsmuth, and we must therefore ask Dr. Wachsmuth w h e t h e r t h i s w o u l d b e c o n v e n i e n t . . o In the summer of 1923, after seeing the patients. Dr. Steiner called Dr. Walter and me and told us that in future he would Imveto put more responsibility for the Clinic on our shoulders. This 78was necessary so that he could do more intensive work with Dr. Wegman for the Anthroposophical Movement and for medicine. They had decided to write a medical book together. Dr. Walter and I must have looked rather disconcerted, for he added, \"What\u2014 do you nd that so hard? I thought I was giving you a piece of good news.\" After that the work took on a rather different shape. For the most part Dr. Wegman, after having discussed everything with us in the morning, went off to Dr. Steiner in his studio, working there with him till about 11 o'clock. They then came together to the Clinic in the little dark blue Ford\u2014generally accompanied by a small shaggy dog given the name \"Mussolini\" by Dr. Steiner; this.little dog was always reluctant to give up his place in the car. Then began the consulting hour. The amount of work Dr. Steiner did was inconceivable. What happened in a single horn: was a constant source of astonishment to us\u2014and without a pause in the work one \"hour followed another. After the Christmas Meeting in 1923, when his health was already affected, we were always making vain efforts to spare him. The following situation is an example. One morning, already very late \u2014perhaps nearly half-past one\u2014I had still to report on a patient in the Sonnenhof, and I gave an account of several new symptoms. The patient's chief complaints were of pain in the head that ran down into her neck and arm, and a nasty-smelling discharge from the nose. Dr. Steiner became more and more serious, nally saying:\" I shall have to see this patient myself.\" Now the symptoms did not appear to me of very great importance; therefore my only thought was to spare him, and I said: \" But, Herr Doktor, surelythat is not necessary; one really does not see anything.\" He looked at me quite kindly but with some surprise, and said with emphasis:\" One perhaps sees nothing.\" Then he visited the patient and saw an extraordiniiry amount, namely a progressive lethargy of the forebrain, and by the exhaustive nature of what he prescribed, the serious illness was arrested. I should like to end by mentioning one more incident, because it so often comes back to me when we are exercised in our minds about our young workers being tired. They may feel what I then experienced and have to recover without the encouragement of theteacher. During the Christmas Meeting in 1923-1924 every room, even every corner, of our house was occupied. The stream of visitors from all the various countries could hardly be dealt with. In the Sonnenhof, people were sleeping on any improvised structure, often several in one room. There were scarcely sufcient hands to cope with the most necessary tasks in the sick rooms and kitchens.Hot and breathless, we rushed into the lectures. One day, as I was going up along the Bretterweg to one of the nieetings. I thought to myself how terrible it was\u2014^such a world-historic moment, andhere was one of us, simply by reason of tiredness, unable to bring to it all her forces and ideas. Feeling guilty and depressed, I toiled 79 CB-6up the hill and entered the hall of the Schreinerei. There I was stopped by those standing around; they pointed in a certain dir^ tion; and as I tinned I saw Dr. Steiner coming towards me with outstretched hand. After his handshake all tiredness left me. With new energy and open-heartedness, one could again enter into all t h a t w a s g o i n g o n . . . . , The completion of the book, written in collaboration with Ita Wegman, was a great joy to Rudolf Steiner. He received the proofs on his sickbed. The book\u2014called in English Fundamentalsof Therapy: An Extension of the Art of Healing through Spiritual Science\u2014appeared after his death in 1925. A seed was here sown which bore within it powerful forces of growth. Rudolf Steiner said of it: \"This book will be able to give only the very rst elementary beginnings; we shall have long left the earth by the time it is accepted as a developed science. . . . What is important is that everything should have passed through hump experience.\" In an age when even in medicine the materialistic world-outlook has more and more to say, and man's perception threatens to be destroyed by technical and mechanical diagnosis, Rudolf Steinerwith Ita Wegman laid down the rst principles of the renewal of a medicine that has its starting-point entirely in the knowledge ofman This knowledge does not take into consideration only man's bodily sheaths that may become sick, but also, what the eternal inman wishes to experience, has to experience, in an illness. With the knowledge of reincarnation and karma as background, the conception of sickness and healing given us by Rudolf Steiner can b e e v e r f u r t h e r d e v e l o p e d . , ^ ^Translated by V* W.T H E R I S I N G G E N E R A T I O N Ernst Lehrs S O M E T I M E S c h i l d r e n h a v e s t r a n g e d r e a m s o f p r o f e s s i o n s a n dvocations which bring a smile to the lips of an adult, yet if one looks back on them in later years, they appear to be a child-like gurative expression of deeper relations of destiny. The ideal profession of my childhood was \" the Emperor.\" I wanted to become an Emperor, because I was convinced that being an Emperor implied \"knowing all.\" For I was unable to imagine that anybody could full the task of a ruler without knowing everything.Even when I learned that only certain people had the prerogative of becoming an Emperor, namely, the eldest son of the Uving ruler, I continued to regard the Emperor as the representative of the absolutely ideal profession. For I was still convinced that an Emperor must\" know everything.\" What I experienced as a yoimg student in meeting Rudolf Steiner for the rst time brought back to my memory at long- forgotten dream of an ideal profession which had accompanied my childhood. Here I faced the man whom I seemed to have sought in an instinctive divining of destiny, and who evoked in me the comforting experience that the human spirit is able to ascend to a sphere where it is possible to \"know everything,\" though, indeed,in a manner different from the usual conception. Somewhat later, when I had become familiar with the nature of spiritual training in its historical development, I was able to under stand why the idea of the \"All-knowing one \" had become identied with \"the Emperor\" in the mind of the child. Echoing in it was something like a primeval memory of those times when initiates, inenhanced states of consciousness, had speech with the aff-knowing gods and received their coimsel, which enabled them, in turn, tobecome leaders of their peoples. \"A king should have nothing more at heart than to be as many-sided, as well informed and as free of prejudice\u2014^in fact, to be and to remain as complete a human being\u2014as is possible.\" That is how Novalis expresses the same primeval memory and the same hope in his essay: \"Faith and H o p e , o r t h e K i n g a n d t h e Q u e e n . \" jIt is necessary to indicate, if only in a few words, what impelled me, a student of physics and mathematics, to take part in the anthroposophical course of lectures for students held in Stuttgart inMarch, 1921, when I rst encountered Rudolf Steiner and his work.For only so can the decisive effect of all that took place durmg this course become comprehensible. , \u00ab ,, ,. The conviction that I was living \"m the best of all worlds,\" which had become mine as a result of the conventional education before the rst world war, had been thoroughly shaken by the 8081experience of war in the front line. When I resumed my interrupted studies, another conviction was shattered; that the scientic method of cognition, as it had been developed by mankind in the course of the past centuries, could enable us to order and handle all human affairs for all times by means of exact thought For not only had all the nations been drawn into the catastrophe of the world war in spite of their scientic achievements, but this war had also sur passed in cruelty all preceding wars by the application of those very achievements. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, then the subject of much discussion and sharp controversy among professors and students, became for me an eloquent symptom of the problems thus haunting me. For the relativism pervading this theory resulted in denying all reality of being and existence to man as man. Nevertheless I felt compelled to accept Einstein's method of thinking as a consistent development of prevalent scientic thinking, whereas all attemptsto refute it appeared to lack this logical character. Thus the refutations appeared to me to be of no avail. Arising out of these premises, a denite spiritual demand in relation to the further evolution of mankind shaped itself within me,. clothing itself in the following picture: I saw before me a river, on the banks of which we\u2014existent numanity\u2014^were standing. On the opposite-bank lay the new land which was to be reached. Thequestion therefore was: how to bridge the river ? Kno-^ledge of the laws of nature would enable one to begin to buUd the bridge\u2014 but, at best, to reach only the middle of the river. In order to build the remaining half, a knowledge of the forces and laws prevaUing on the opposite bank of the river would have been necessary , and this could be obtained only over there. But how could one get there while the bridge did not yet exist? First of all, no doubt,some pioneers would have to cross the river by swimming. Where could the men be found who were prepared to equip themselves for such a deed\"^. Where were those who could muster the courage. What I read in the programme of the anthroposophical lectures for students in Stuttgart, pinned on the notice-board of the university where I was studying, appeared to me to speak of a willingness to carry out such a courage-demanding deed in the spirit, and so Idecided to attend.\u2014I was led to recall in my memory these feelings and impulses when, on a later occasion, in summing up what he had said before in various ways, Rudolf Stemer told us young p e o p l e : \" A n t h r o p o s o p h y i s m e a n t t o b e t h e g r e a t s c h o o l o f c o u r a g e . 5 5 H * * Besides Rudolf Steiner's lectures and those of his co-workers, the course included daily discussions in the style of a seminar on various subjects. The content of these discussions cannot nowbe reproduced: apart from the fact that the memory of the beginner of those days fails me here (except for isolated details), thereare unfortunately no shorthand notes of those impressive delibera tions. However, what did leave an indelible mark was Rudolf Steiner's personal attitude. He was present at all the seminars, listening kindly without immediately taking part. Presently, however, a moment would come when he spontaneously entered the discussion. All that he then brought forward, in reply to a question or an objection, made the members of the seminar reaUsewith astonishment that they were faced with a thinker who was not only fully versed in every specialised eld, but could ako amplify the existing body of knowledge by offemg essentialinformation drawn from his own knowledge of the spiritual side of man and the universe. Whether the question concerned some problem of science, higher mathematics, the history of art, philosophy or anything else, it was just the same\u2014he invariablymade his contribution in a quiet voice, instinct with inner assurance, as a friendly offering, thus giving the impression that it took no effort to know and master all this. Here one could reco^ise a mind which had reached this all-embracing knowledge in a different way from that of accumulating a mass of learned details, exhaustingits vitality in the process. Rudolf Steiner lived\u2014as I came to realise in the course of these days\u2014on a higher vantage-point in relation to knowledge; from there he could dive down into a given realm and speak about it as though he had occupied himself wim nothing else throughout his life. It can be imagined what mis meant to a student who was thirsting for the truly human, and for an understanding of the real nature of man. In ^s connection it was a special experience to watch how very dferently RudolfSteiner would behave in situations apparently similar in characte^ taking into account the human background of those who had raiseda question. Three examples will bring this out. Among those taking part in the -discussions there were some who tried to draw attention to themselves by praising everythmg brought forward from the anthroposophical side, but at the sametime liked to mention some other spiritual teachmg, with the \"good\" advice not to neglect it, but to bring it mto a syntoesiswith Anthroposophy . There were others who felt the call to disturb almost every discussion, just when it had reached a generaUy s a t i s f y i n g c o n c l u s i o n , b y r a i s i n g a n o b j e c t i o n w h i c h a p p e a r e d t o b e relevant but was not based on personal knowledge. T owards the end of a discussion on the signicance of mathe matics for a natural science extended by spiritual science, the conversation touched on synthetic geometey , following a remark by Rudolf Steiner . One of those who took part in \u00b1e discussion,a representative of the rst group, remarked that he was not a mathematician and had no knowledge of higher rnathematics, buto n t h e s u b j e c t o f s y n t h e t i c g e o m e t r y , r e c o m m e n d e d b y I ^ . S t e r n e r , he would like to advise the anthroposophical scientists not to under-rate the importance of the innitesimal calculus.Barely had this been said when Rudolf Steiner stood up with flashing eyes and thundered into the room: \"I don't understandhow anyone who has to admit that he knows nothing of mathe matics can venture to give us advice in these matters.\" The adviser never made himself heard again during the whole course of lectures. Another man, representative of the other attitude, who had come to be quite a burden on all the open-minded members of the conference because of his futile or superfluous objections, raised his voice at the end of a history-seminar which had been dealing with the spiritual differentiation of humanity into an Asiatic- Eastern, an Anglo-American-Western and a mediating Eiuropean group: \"But what about Czecho-Slovakia?\" he asked. The discussion leaders, certain of being backed by all the open- minded students, were just about to ignore the remark and to close the seminar, when Rudolf Steiner quickly rose to his feet and, pointing towards the audience, said: \" The gentleman at the back has raised a very interesting question which I would gladly answer.\" He added that he would need about three-quarters of an hour for it, and asked whether this could be tted in on the following day, which of course was agreed to. At the appointed time on the following day, Rudolf Steiner, addressing a packed audience, gave a survey of Ae history of Ae Czech people, going into amazing details, with the aim of making clear the special spiritual task of the Czech, as bridge-builders between the Central-European and the East-European-Slav spirituality. In the comrse of his talk he repeatedly turned to theman who had put the question, addressing him somewhat as foUows: \"You may remember, in such and such a century (the exact date followed) such and such an event occurred with such and such signicant consequences.\" Or: \" Then yoiur well-known writer (thename, followed), in publishing his work in such and such a year, exercised a powerful influence of such and such a nature on the evolution of the Czech people.\" Listeners sitting near the man thus addressed saw him become more and more astonished. While leaving the lecture-room I passed him accidentally and heard him say, partly to himself and partly to the man walking by his side, \"No, never would I have thought that anyone could know so much about the Czech people.\" His \"but\" was silenced for the rest of the conference. A third happening which threw a liberating hght on the theory of relativity, sq sorely troubling me, was the following. Some representatives of orthodox science took the opportunity of the conference to invite Rudolf Steiner to a discussion on a number of fundamental theses such as the electromagnetic wave-nature of light, the atomistic structure of matter and the relativity of movement. The invitation was accepted. One of the speakers tried to demonstrate the validity of the theory of relativity in a somewhat light-hearted way by rst striking a match on a matchbox which heheld motionless in his other hand. Then he lit another, this timd holding the match still and moving the box across it Whereupon Rudolf Steiner, quite calmly and with what seemed like a sly smile, replied: \"I would like to know how you would carry out your demonstration if I were to nail the matchbox over there on the waU?\" It was clear: in order to carry out the second method of striking a light, the person holding the match would have to take his stand somewhere outside the earth, at a xed point in space, and from there would have to move tibe whole earA, with this building and the matchbox attached to it, across the match! In this way Rudolf Steiner illustrated the fact that, as he repeatedly expressed it. relativity theory operates with \" thoughts one cannot really think.\" Among those who represented the views of science was a well-known theoretical physicist, to-day one of the leaders in this eld,who was then at the beginning of Ids rise to fame. Not long before I had myself attended, at my xmiversity , a course of lectures he had given on the theory of electrons. He now himself entered the discussion and advanced in favom of relativity the fact that for our observation there exists no standpoint from which a cosmic motionsuch as that of a planet can be obsejwed, except in relation to the movement of some other cosmic object of obse^ation, and ttottherefore we have no right to bring such a motion into our scientic considerations in any other way than as a relative one. T oRudolf Steiner gave the foUowing reply . He asked us to in^gjne two people sitting on a bench in a park, and therefore both m tne same state of motion, outwardly; but differing in that one of them is breathing normally and has a normal complexion, while the otheris deeply flushed, with his forehead covered in sweat, and is pantu^ for breath. In such a case it would be evident, from observable differences in the physiological conditions of the two people, tot one of them\u2014though in this case at a time previous to that of the observation\u2014^had been in a different absolute state of motion from the otor. And science will develop to to point of obrervmg m asimilar way , on to single planetary bodies, phenomena from whichit will be possible to read their absolute state of motion. _ For myself, this was a moment when a cimain seemed to lift, g i v i n g a g l i m p s e i n t o a r e a l m o f p o s s i b i l i t i e s o f t o o w l e d ^ ^my heart had yearned for . There was to joyful reahsation. Hweis genuine science! Here is no countenng of one hpoAesis by another; here, limited experience is answered by an actually\u2014-or atleast potentially\u2014wider experie^!\" Atp h y s i c i s t , g r e a t l y m o v e d , s p r a n g f r o m h i s s e a t a n d m t h e m p h a t i cgestures showing his emotion,, exclaimed: Y es, yes, ifdeed\u2014f fsome day tot becomes possible, to theory of relativity will c o l l a p s e ! \" , , For a few moments all was quiet in the hall; ton the discussionwent on. Although at to time I was unable to give a clear accountof it to myself, I had the impression that in the destiny of the physicist's entelechy something had taken place of far greater signicance than his acknowledgment or denial of the spiritual-scientic statement. TTirough an intuitive recognition of his personality, Rudolf Steiner had helped him to gain this, just by refraining throughout the discussiou from making the slightest effort to compel his opponents to acknowledge the correctness of his views and the error of theirs. Again and again he simply set forth, with quiet assurance, what a realistic method of observation had to say about the matter under consideration. The concluding words of Rudolf Steiner's lectures at that con ference must be given here verbatim, for one can hear in them a keynote which rang forth again eighteen months later in a signicantly altered situation. \"It is not my habit to use traditional phrases, even when they have acquired a hallowed character; I prefer to go back always to the unadorned truth. In our histories of literature and culture a pompous phrase frequently occurs, supposed to have been the lastwords of the dying netbe: 'T.ight. more light!' Well, Goethe lay in a dark comer of his small room and the opposite window had closed shutters. From all I know about Goethe. I have good reason to Believe ^at these words \\vere simplv. 'Open the sutters!' But in dealing so nereticaily with this pompous phrase in relation to Goethe, whom I love and revere, I should like all the same to invoke the simpler phrase, at the close of our study-course, by saying: T o you, my dear fellow-students, now that we feel united in the roomfrom which the windows open on spiritual knowledge, I would address this call Out of the spirit which has brought us here together , I say to you: Open the shutters!\"A year and a half later , in October , 1922, young people crowded round Rudolf Steiner\u2014this time not merely to hear about the possibility of a spiritual renewal of science, but in order to receivean answer to essential questions concerning their own development as human beings. And in view of the chaos in human affairs which was then clearly beginning to manifest itself, they also sought guidance for the social tasks of the future. Again Rudolf Steinercontrasted the phrase attributed to Goethe with the real one, but this time in a somewhat different key, characteristic of his way of speaking to these young people: \"Perhaps the words Goethe reallysaid are more apt than the phrase, 'More light!' The state of things prevailing at the end of the nineteenth century gave rise, indeed, to the feeling,' The shutters have been closed by those vvho came before us.' Then this new generation came along, and they felt hemmed in; they felt, 'The shutters which the older generation has closed so tightly must be thrown open.' Y es, my dear friends,let me promise you that, although I am old, I will speak to you in the next few days of how we can try to get the shutters open. These were the words with which Rudolf Steiner concluded theopening lecture of that series of thirteen lectures which we called \"Pedagogical Course for Y oung People,\" or, simply, the \"Y outh Course,\" a name they have retained.* In many respects this course was an unusual occurrence in the life of the anthroposophical movement, for it had come about through a group made up partlyof very young people who had approached Rudolf Steiner directly , ignoring the functionaries of the Anthroposophical Society as wellas the active members then living in Stuttgart. Besides this, these young people found themselves in a difcult situation before the course began. During the preliminary conversation between their representatives and Rudolf Steiner, he was told that in their opinionall the preceding conferences and lecture-courses contained too much of the element of \" programme,\" and that this was detrimental to the unfolding of individual creative powers. All this appeared to them to have too much of a \" 19th centui^ flavour.\" Rudolf Steiner listened to all this with visible, positive interest and promised to arrange the lectures accordingly . Then these young people went off to travel round and kindle interest in the project among those of their own age. Great was their shock, however, when they heard shortly before the course was to begin that Rudolf Steiner, in reply to a query about the actual purpose of this course, had' replied that he did not know it either. The representatives of the young people had brought him a variety of requests, but they hadnot made it clear what they really wanted. One of us went to see Rudolf Steiner, hoping to hear from his own lips how matters stood. The answer was that as we had t(d him of our aversion to \"programmes,\" he had decided to give the course of lectures entirely without a programme. He had been informed that we proposed to arrange one or two days before the beginning of the course in preparation for our work with hinu we ought to use that time for getting our minds clear about the ^bj^tof the rst lecture. After the rst lecture we could^take what he had said to us and from out of it nd the theme for the second lecture, and so on. \" In this way we will shape the course together , entirely without a premeditated programme.\" At that moment we got a foretaste of the inexorable method he was following toowmgus back on our own initiative and waiting for at least a &st step from us before stretching out his hand to give us further help and guidance. ^ t. u u Never before or afterwards can human beings have been sog r a t e f u l f o r R u d o l f S t e i n e r ' s n o t c o m i n g a s w \u00ae ^ \u00ae , t h e y o u n g ^ o p l et h e n g a t h e r e d t o g e t h e r : i n t h e c o u r s e o f t w o a n d a h a l f d a y s t h e yr e c e i v e d r e p e a t e d t e l e p h o n e m e s s a g e s f r o m D o r n a c h t o f e e f f e c tthat unfortunately Dr . Steiner was still unable to leave. This gave us more time to wrestle with the formulation of a subject which * There is a fduplicated) English translation with the title, \"The New Cultivation of the Inner Life and for Outer Deed.would express our spiritual situation. Barely had we found it, when the message reached us that Dr. Steiner had left Dornach. Punctually, at the appointed time, he arrived. But when our subject was mentioned, he surprised us by not appearing to be particularly interested; he merely said kindly that he would rst ^ve a lecture which would be of the natmre of a welcome and anintroduction. In fact, this lecture contained in close-knit structure all the themes which had exercised our minds during the preceding days. Throughout the following twelve days we were never askedfor another subject. Obviously in the days of otir wrestling some thing had happened spiritually which sufced to provide Dr. Steiner with a setting for all he wished to say. The arbitrary procedure of appealing directly to Dr. Steiner arose from our feeling that our situation in the anthroposophical movement was a very specic one, forcing us to ask questions which could not be answered protably by the older members. We also felt that we could not nd the help we needed in the existing anthroposophical literature, whether books or lectures. We soughtfor clarity about our own aims; we wanted to know how we, as young people, could train ourselves in order to become creativeco-workers in shaping the new culture which was demanded by progressive humanity. Above all, we wanted to know how one could proceed \"from speaking about the spirit to speaking out of thejp^\"; now spirit could stream mto the maniiom proiessionalactivities which were coming to engage us. Then we were exercised by the problem of how a human commimity could be formed and nurtured in the spirit of our time. As a goal before us, we saw the creation of foimdations for a modern \"cultural pedagogy,\" and particularly a pedagogy for the adolescent age. Referring to those lectures, Rudolf Steiner remarked later on that, thanks to the character of his audience, he had been able to speak more pictorially than almost ever before. Indeed, lectureafter lectiure called up a whole series of pictures growing out of one another. He started by dwelling on the inner stress and strain experienced by young people at fe beginning of our century,because the older generation confronted them with all manner of standpoints derived from this or that philosophy of life. But allthese standpoints, he said, had by then acquired beneath them a crust of ice. ITie spiritual ice-age had come. The ice was thin, but as people had lost the sense of weight in feir standpoints, they did not break through the crust. Besides, being cold at heart, they did not thaw the ice. The young people stood alongside their elders; their hearts were warm. Teir warmheartedness was still speechless, but it broke through the ice. The young person did notfeel \"This is my standpoint,\" but, \"I am losing the ground fromunder my feet My own heart's warmth is breaking the ice. The ice, he said, had been formed out of empty phrases, con vention, and routine\u2014empty phrases, which intruded into spiritual 88life when in the last third of the 19th century thoughts ceased to be permeated by the soul; convention, which dominated social life,instead of a real human community coming into being; routine, which in the practical life of men had usurped the place of personal commitment. When Rudolf Steiner used these images, he was not merely giving an artistic clothing to a fact which could have been expressed in an unpictorial way. What troubled the young people was essentially an emotional experience which they did not fully understand. But the life of feeling takes its course on a level of con sciousness which is similar to dream-consciousness. Just as we dream in pictures, so, too, we feel in pictures, although the latter may not always rise to the level of awareness. Hence they can torment us. Rudolf Steiner raised these pictmres into the con sciousness of the young people. So, for instance, when he spoke of Wissenschaft* as a being. When one made her acquaintance, when she has been repeatedly introduced to one, then the recognition comes (in this degree it probably came only to Rudolf Steiner, who even as a young man could consciously experience what we only dream) \" that another being has stealthily crept away to one side in a shamefaced manner, feeling that she was no longer tolerated. But she would still say if one felt goaded to talk to her secretly in a back-room: ' I have a name which may no longer be mentioned in the presence of Objective Science. I am called Philosophy, Sophia: Wisdom. I take my disgraceful rst name from Love iphilo), and I have something which by its very name is bound to have some thing to do with man's innermost being, with love. I dare not let myself be seen; only in a shamefaced way dare I move about'\" With words such as these, Rudolf Steiner did not intend to m^e the young people arrogant or supercilious towards higher learning and its achievements, or-to dissuade those who studied it from continuing their work seriously. Earlier on, in fact, Jeferring to a certain tendency in the rst youth-movement to treat thought in its \"pallor\" in a contemptuous way and to ee from it, he had said: Thoughts are necessary for living as a human being, and wecan never dispense with the thoughts given us by the last few centuries. However, they should not get stuck in the head, but they should be conceived so strongly \" fat fey stream through theheart and through the entire human being right down into his feet. For, truly, it is far better if not merely white and red blood- corpuscles, but thoughts also, pulsate through our blood.\" It is right for man to have a heart, and not merely thoughts. But themost precious thing of all is for thoughts to Mve ahem.\" It was not science, but the way science was handled, that he had in mind when in this way he characterised the inner experience of the young \u00bb Untranslatable here: the word covers both science and the humanities. 89in the course of these lectures he spoke of the sigmcance of the path leading to the strengthening of thinking, as indicated in his Philosophy of Spiritual Activity. In making the effort really to practise what is there called \"pure thinking,\" one comes to experience that this is a will-exercise, leading right into the centreof man's being. It shows one that ordinary thinking is indeed nothing but an activity of the head; you feel you are beginning no longer to think \"so high up there,\" but to think in the breast. \"You notice that as the process of thinking becomes more and more an activity of the will, it rst wrestles itself free from the chest and then gradually from the entire body. It is as though you had to draw forth this thinking from the last bre of your big toe.\" In this way one comes to feel that \" a new inner man is bom who, out of the spirit, can bring about the unfolding of the will.\" Throughout the Youth Course, Rudolf Steiner had repeated occasion to refer to his Philosophy of Spiritual Activity, because he wished to bring out the signicance of moral intuitions, which had to be drawn forth from every individual for the moral life of the present and the future, and because this book indicates the path to this intuitive capacity. For the fourth lecture he appeared carrying a small notebook. Those familiar with his method of working knew that he possessed a great number of notebooks, dating from all his years of work, in which he was in the habit of putting down thoughts or making sketches. He did this, as he said, not for the purpose of looking up, later on, what had been written down, but because it is easierto remember something the spirit has grasped when it is imme- ditely connected with a movement of the limbs. We young people were deeply touched when we realised that Rudolf Steiner had taken the trouble of going through his notebooks on our behalf in order to pick out one belonging to the year 1893. From this note book he read us a review of Spencer's Principles of Ethics which had appeared in a German literary magazine of those days, where the reviewer had written that Spencer's master-work must silence, at least in the realm of exact knowledge, the last attempts to found ethical discrimination on intuition, inborn feelings, even self-evident axioms, etc.\" Then he began to describe how he had had to place his Philosophy of Spiritual Activity right into the ethical mood of that time\u2014^this book which shows that \"the whole future of human ethics depends on the power of moral intuition becoming stronger every day .\" When he described from various aspects his own radicalopposition to the prevailing views of that period, the inner strugglehe had gone through at the time becanie more and more movingly evident. What can be read to-day in fhe clear and smoothly running report of this lecture should be pictured as having beenuttered in tones of vibrant emotion. There he stood before us, once again a man of thirty-two, who, out of a self-imposed duty ofservice to his time and because of his spiritual insight into its heeds, faced his contemporaries in complete loneliness and boldly raised his voice against the ever-rising storm of materialism. The inner drama he had gone through, while to outward appearance sitting quietly in a Vienna cafe\u2014this came before us at that moment in bodily reality! There he was, standing at the balustrade of the platform, with shining eyes, his right hand holding his notebook, and hammering thunderously on the balustrade, while with a voice that lled the entire hall he called down to us; \" It was therefore necessary for me, my dear friends, to make the attempt to write a book representing, in a most determined way, the very standpoint which was described by men of learning, in an equally determined way, as one that should be nally silenced.\" The\" search for the hero,\" so often mentioned in the youth movement, here found fullment: here the heart of youth, oppressed by the troubles of the time, found its hero of the spirit. We went home after this lecture without saying very much to one another; the experience had stirred us to our depths. Many among us may have pledged themselves silently to follow in Rudolf Steiner's footsteps in the unfolding of courage, in soul and spirit, on however humble a scale. Later on we were to leam more exactiy the actual character of this courage. It was the courage to say to oneself, \" The life of the world must be made new again from its very foundations.\" And certainly, \"Courage\u2014one learns it very quickly, or not at all.\" Our question\u2014\"How can we leam to progress from speaking about the spirit to speaking out of the spirit?\"\u2014^was answered by Rudolf Steiner during the Youth-course, and subsequently, by simply demonstrating it in practice. The word \" simply \" is meantin the sense that he often took the apparently simplest examples, thus illustrating what in the 1924 lecture-course, which laid the basis of curative education, he called \"reverence for little things.\" Almost daily , too, he met us apart from the lectures, entering into the manifold needs of those taking part in the course. There were young sculptors who showed him samples of their labours, in order to seek advice for future work; poets who received from him individually the most varied indications concerning rhyme andrhythm; daily he came to the recitation lessons provided by Frau Steiner , gave speech-exercises, explained the vowels and consonants, and on two occasions even recited to us himself.^ Because an interest in painting had arisen, he gave a few painting lessons. Finally , he was present at some of the discussions which themembers of the course had arranged among themselves. During one of these discussions, a young farmer spoke as best he could about the being of the Christ. Although he expressed himself rather awkwardly, we listened to him with a certain respect, due above all to his subject. But as he went on and began to speak 90of what his experience in farming had taught him about manure, we turned up our noses with the feeling that Dr. Steiner's presence should not be claimed for such \" vulgar \" matters. The next day those responsible for running the course had an interview with Rudolf Steiner on some special points. He asked for the name of the farmer and said to our surprise; \"What the young man said about Christ was fairly insignicant.\" Then he added, with friendly emphasis: \"But what he said about manure was excellent.\" Hewould like to add something himself to it at the next meeting. (The course of lectures which founded bio-dynamic agriculture had not yet been given.) The following is an attempt to record not only what he said at this meeting, but also his manner of speaking:\" It was interesting what you said yesterday , as a farmer . I have no time to stay here much longer, so I will briefly add the following. In agriculture, too, the spiritual is being sought. There, too, it is believed that new methods should be found, right down into the handling of material substance. If you turn to modern materialistic science, you will not nd much affection for agriculture. Modern science holds that in the case of a eld needing so much nitrogen, one must put this quantity into it. The scientists are not aware that one need only plant sainfoin* systematically round the eld in order to draw in the right amount of nitrogen by radiation. It would be enough to plant a single row of sainfoin all round the eld.\" A brave man among us, who did not know what sainfoin is, asked about it. Dr. Steiner immediately replied, and in such a way that we felt he was not speaking \" about\" this plant, nor as though it were absent, but that through the intiniate tone of his voice, the pondering attitude, the movement of his hands, the immediate spiritual presence of what he was describing could be experienced deeply and impressively. It was as if the sainfoin actually cameinto being through his words and gestures. Perhaps one might try to catch an echo of this experience from the following recorded words: \"Sainfoin ... they are plants ... they have flowers grow in clusters . then: \"This plant has the remarkable capacity to permeate the ground over a considerable area with what human beings are trying to introduce into the soil articially. Do you believe this is nonsense? No! These areindeed things which can be recognised if one is able to penetrateinto matter by means of denite spiritual knowledge right into the material realm.\" * * * * The scope of an essay such as this is limited by the space available. Much of what was experienced in connection with the great addresses to young people which followed in the years * Onobrychis sativa. 921923/24, and during my own life as a Waldorf School teacher, must be left out. There is room only for a few aspects which are as valid to-day as they were valid then; their signicance for the young pwple now growing up, as well as for the coming generations ofthis century, will indeed increase continually. The older generation usually tends either to criticise and reject &e rising one, or else tries to win it over to its own side and for its own aims. When some of the young people brought their questions in a corporate way to Rudolf Steiner for the rst time,he r^ponded so readily because the spiritual background lay open to him\u2014the background whence the new generation had started on its way earthwards, and whence all the following generations would proceed. He saw that deep in the souls of these young people there was living something new in the history of mankind. He knew that what was \"rumbling\" in them had great possibilities, but that it could also involve great dangers if the right guidance were lacking. His rst step in fis direction was to help the young people to become conscious of their own inward tendencies. He emphasised repeatedly that the opposition between young and old which at the turn of the century had emerged for the rst time on a large, organised scale, was different from anything of the kind that had arisen previously.* As he told us in his address to young people gathered at Amhem in Holland in the summer of 1924, ithad been quite clear to him from the very beginning of the youth movement that \"in the deepest subconsciousness of the great majority of the young people of the present day there lives a tendency towards a remarkably thorough imderstanding of the fact that a great earthquake-like revolution in the entire development of mankind is bound to take place.\" We are in the habit of associating denite, clearly outlined ideas with certain centuries, as when we speak of the two phases of Renaissance painting, designating them simply as Quattrocento and Cinquecento. We speak of the XXth century and connect withit a certain way of tiiinking which differs from that of the XlXth century. T o the spiritual penetration of Rudolf Steiner the turning- point between the XlXth and XXth centuries revealed itself in a far deeper sense as something very special in the history of man kind. This turning-point is connected with a unique change in spiritual conditions, not only on earth, but in the whole cosmos\u2014that is, the world in which the human soul dwells before birth. It was this change which made it possible for Rudolf Steiner to begin his teaching work from the moment of that turning-point\u2014as, in fact, he did. Naturally , it sounded presumptuous to the older people when the human beings bom at that time described themselves as \"totally different people\"; in reality it was a stammering, * This refers to the German Wandervoeel movement which arose in 1899 and, together with its successors, played a signicant part among the rising generation up to World War I.a begging to be taught to understand themselves, the human beings character and was intended as a pointer towards what was to be whom they felt to be \" totally different.\" Rudolf Stemer saw what ) expected in the future. To-day the struggle has become acute. Inwas trying to break through. Since the turning-point these souls theories such as that which recognises in man nothing but the nalhad indeed been bringing down to earth, in the depths of tneir will- stage in the sequence of animal development, or in the theory of nature, an urge towards the spiritual\u2014an urge which, if it fails to conservation of matter and energy which prevails in physics, nd its goal, is bound to manifest in pathological ways: in organic spiritual signature of the Dragon of our time is revealed.

But as with him e>^rything was kept Rudolf Steiner then transformed this into another picture which in true balance, he allowed those who came to hirn to experience entirely new\u2014indeed, one can say that it inaugurates a new also a necessary damping down of premature aspirations, or, at mythology for mankind.

How readily did he let his eyes twinkle in warm hearted humour\u2014while perhaps at the very next moment he would seem to be gazing out with lofty earnestness, far over his audience, as into cosmic distances. In the last lecture of the Youth Course, Rudolf Steiner gave to us\u2014and thereby to the young people of our whole epoch\u2014the crowning picture of the course: Michael s ght with the Dragon.It is the picture for the struggle of the spiritualised intelligence of man against the power of materialism and all its effects\u2014^killing men, devouring men. In older times, too, this picture was known and given outward expression, but in those days it had a prophetic CB-.7O N E O F T H E Y O U N G D O C T O R S Kurt Magerstadt F ' J 1 9 2 1 1 h a d g o n e t o s t u d y i n T u b i n g e n .

I had to go on foot a fairly long way every day to the University, and as I walked along in the duskbetween the lime-trees of the avenue, I put a question to a qxiite denite star which I did not know at the time to be Sirius. I asked:\" If there is a spiritual world I should like to know something about it.\" I was interested at that time in Swedenborg's writing, especially his Heavenly Jerusalem, and this may have ultimately prompted the question.

It was on Anthropo- sophy and new theological knowledge; it appeared, moreover , tW there had been two Jesus-children. The speaker was named Emil Bock, and the student who sat next me and then lent me Rudolf Steiner's Phllosophie der Freiheit was Kurt von Wistinghausen. Inwardly I pricked up my ears; was it to this that I had to pay attention? About a year went by; I moved to the University of Rostock and was one day called upon with another student\u2014as was custom ary with the seniors\u2014^to attend a Polish peasant woman at thebirth of her child. The child did not come; a whole night was spent in waiting, and during the night my fellow-student\u2014^Heinrich Hardt\u2014told me about Anthroposophy. We struck up a friendstup and a few days later he said to me: \"We will go presently and meet a colleague who has just been in Domach.\" As we stood on the platform after our work, the man we were expecting got down from the train and Hardt introduced us: Manfried v. Kries\u2014^Mager asked Kries in astonishment, \"Magerstadt? You are the one I was to look for.\" \"How isthat?\" I said. \" Because it has struck some of us that you are on the look out for something denite. K you had not been here now, I should have asked for die list of students and gone to nd you. I was told that you belong to the group that istotraveltoDornach.\" 96I was trying at that time to x up my doctorate work and had come to Rostock because the University there seemed the most likely to accept the theme I had set myself\u2014Iriscopy', diagnosisfrom the eye. It naturally interested me now to hear that Rudolf Steiner had also worked for his doctor's degree at Rostock Univer sity, and in all simplicity I wrote to him that as I was invited to Domach for the coming Medical Conference, I would make so bold as to consult him about my work, and thereupon I gave an account of my idea of the threefold membering of the eye. Our course was to begin early in January and we started in advance\u2014it was 1923\u2014^for the Christmas Foundation Meeting at Dornach. We Germans came out of inflation and depression into the well-ordered conditions of Switzerland and those who had grown up during the World War\u2014I had been a volunteer\u2014^had their rst fuUy conscious experience of a land of peace. On the Domach hill, however, stood the ruins of the bumt-down Goethea- num, prophetic symbol of the countless rains which Europe was to experience. It was swarming with people. One saw an amazing number of interesting faces, the most peculiar individualities. For the rstlecture that I was to hear from Rudolf Steiner I found a seat on the stage of the Schreinerei, behind the speaker's desk, in order to beable to observe everything as closely as possible. From here one looked out over the throng who sat and waited. Finally there arose a general movement, faces tumed to a doorway. .. Was it a youth who came striding in? Everyone has his own way of walking; one person bobs up and down, another pushes forward with his head,another has his nose in the air\u2014and here one saw a man calmly advancing who from the distance looked like a youth; one could only say of him that he walked with resting head. He greeted oneor other person with a movement of the hand, with a glance of the eyes or a nod, and then he came on to the stage. All I could think of was\u2014What a walk, what a carriage, this man has! That was my rst impression of Rudolf Steiner. Like many homeless souls, 1 had sampled all sorts of groups, such as the Wandervogel, the Eucken-Kreis, the Lhotzki circle, Ae Kloster-Beuron, and nowhere had 1 found a satisfying conjunction of action, thought and speech. Here now was a complete human being. Nevertheless, since many negative experiences had made me cautious and critical, 1 exercised the skills which I fancied 1 possessed in order to see through any possible artices. Up to a point 1 was familiar with palmistry, physiognomy and graphology. So 1 sat there and took careful note. 1 studied the face, tried to see the lines on the hand when Rudolf Steiner raised it... Who is this man? 1 asked myself. Never before had 1 seen such lines. It was a full rm hand, the hand of a sculptor, the rst nger almost the same length as the middle nger; Jupiter and Satum, as one was accustomed to say, developed in equal strength. 97Then, at an unexpected time, I came to the conversation I had hoped for. Rudolf Steiner stood in the light, I in the darkness.I was struck by his wonderful iris, an iris that shone differently in every light; at the moment it was amber-coloured. Then I had a peculiar experience. I must have observed too closely and withoutthe right respect, and was wordlessly rebuffed. I felt it like a blow that went right through me. It was a repulse and seemed to say: No\u2014^not like that. The spoken words, however, were: \"I have received your letter and now that I know you I can say: You can become a University Professor\u2014or you can become an Anthro- posophist.\" I was speechless. This was truly no answer to astudent's question about his doctorate-thesis; yet it was one of those answers which one has to puzzle over for a long time. Moreover, after his unspoken rebuke I had at the same time an overwhelming realisation. I knew spontaneously; I who have felt homeless, this is my home. Here I belong. This home was connected intimately VAth the personality of Rudolf Steiner. All that is good and ne of which a 24-year-old is at all capable came powerfully to life within me. During the next three days I heard all the lectures that RudolfSteiner gave, sitting at one time on the right, at another on the left, or behind, or in front. The gure of the teacher appeared to me immersed in a coloured spirit-atmosphere, and I could not so quickly give up my habit of wanting to test everything. The impression remained \\mchanged. The people, too, whom I encountered revealed immediately the fundamental nuance of their soul and spirit. Itwas an experience that grew too much for me; I could hardly bear it One day in this mood and for no particular reason I went up to the Schreinerei. There round the comer came Rudolf Steiner.' Well, are you going to be an Anthroposophist?' ' Yes', I replied. He gave me his hand, and with this handclasp all the peculiar experiences of the last few days were taken from me. During the Christmas Meeting I had taken over the night-watchfrom one of the watchers.* By night and sometimes also by day I now walked round the grounds. Once I had to take duty between midnight and 3 a.m. From my post I could see the Villa Hansi,where Dr. Steiner lived, and was aware of the light burning in his room. As I was relieved at 3 o'clock it went out; but when for some reason or other I went over to my quarters in the Sonnenhof an hour later, I saw that it was already biuning again. So he had slept for only one hour. * * ' * \u00ab When the Conference was over, the Course for young doctors began, in the early days of the New Year. And now all the ques tions and longings that I had carried within me foxmd their answer. *The watch was a precaution prompted by the burning down of the Coetheanum a year before.\u2014Editors' note. 98Until then 1 had not seen my way in the world. T o be smre, 1 had got through my rst medical examination quite well, but through my study of medicine had not the human being become more thanever a mere pieced-together, mosaic picture? The idea of the archetype of man was lacking, and since I had not fotmd this, thereal human relevance of my studies was also lacking. Now for the rst time I gained a picture of man and so, too, of the universe. Until then I had been a stranger on the earth, even though I had often been in the mood for all sorts of frivolous nonsense. Some times I could take myself by the ear and ask: Man, how do you come to be here? Are you really you? Now, for the rst time, I felt myself truly incarnated and awake; at last I had found the wholeness of universe, earth, man. I was a blind man whose bandage had been removed: who looked round and rejoiced: \" Oh, how beautiful it is in the world! Spirit and nature are one!\" All at once I became happier and healthier. A second course for young doctors was promised for Easter, 1924. Heinrich Hardt and I were in the middle of the State examinations, between two sessions, but we could not resist travel ling from Rostock to Domach for at least a few days. Coming fromthe North, where there was still hardly a hint of spring, we plimged into the superabundantly blooming garden-world of Dornach. We walked through white cheny-tree clouds along the Bretterweg to the Glashaus, where the windows for die rst Goetheanum had been ground. We could not stay till the end of the course; the date of the examination was unalterable. I was overcome by the feeling that if I could take leave of Rudolf Steiner personally, I should be able to do everything. It was difcult to get near him, so that in the end I had to push rather forcibly through rows of colleagues, but it was successful: I could say adieu and thank him. The same after noon we got back to Rostock and the examinations began in the evening. This time in Domach, amidst all the causes for happiness, there had been moments full of unexpected deep anxiety. In my love for my new-found teacher I began to notice everything carefully in a new way, and thus I saw that his bodily forces were lessening. When he came up to the Glashaus, there were no longer the even, winged footsteps: the head no longer sat on a poised body. These moments, however, were quickly supplanted by opposite impres sions and I could hope that I had been deceived. * * * \u00bb The State examination was over in May and after my gradua tion I began to work as a doctor in a nature-cure clinic at Jena, where my friends Lofer, Strohschein and Pickert were on tihe point of creating the rst Home for Anthroposophical Curative Education at Lauenstein. When Rudolf Steiner came in June to open it, I was able to be there. During a pause between the meet- 99ings I presented myself to him as be walked in the garden. Ithanked him for the fact that one could cultivate a ri^t nature- sense again, notice whether one were walking on. flint or chalk, how the flora reacted to this or that, what animal life was present. . . . And how one could now arrive at results; if one puzzled over a problem in the evening, the answers would come in the morning.\"Yes, Magprstadt,\" he said kindly, and smiling a little in jest, \"the Lord gives to His own in sleep.\" Then he became serious. \"In the night thoughts are accepted, or not. If they are right, it is possible to come to results; one nds remedies and so on.\" A pupil of the Home came up with a little Kodak in his hand and asked Dr. Steiner if he might photograph him. This was agreed, and in the silence I was already looking forward to the snapshot (of which, imfortunately, nothing came out). Rudolf Steiner invited the boy to take a second snap, but for this he would have had to fetch another lm from the house, and now the child's will was negative\u2014^he no longer wanted to do it. Dr. Steiner pointed out how this incident already provided a certain diagnosis \u2014^namely, that the child was faUing to bring his interest down into the metaboUc-limb system, because his etheric and physical bodies struggled against it. In the Curative Education Course he wouldreturn to the case of this child in detail; I had decided, however, on the spur of the moment to take advantage of the precious time and remained at his side. We walked slowly out of the garden and passed a lime tree that had a large protuberance in the wood.Rudolf Steiner pointed to the tree, which, as he said, was not developing vertically, but horizontally, away from the direction of growth. He would like to have this excrescence, he said, if someone would cut it off for him, so that experiments could be made with it in the Domach laboratory. When I asked in what way, he replied that the wood woxild be reduced to charcoal and then worked on further. I was anxious to take up one of his remarks during the midday meal. He had mentioned how all the men who had brought about movements of some importance in Jena had come from outside Schiller, Goethe, FiChte, Haeckel\u2014and my local patriotism as a Thuringian thus came off badly. Even if the Thiiringians, I said,had set going no great events, yet they were very strongly connected with nature and had a special relation to the art of healing. \"Yes,\" he resimnded, \" the link with nature and the relation to healing are there; it was not without cause that Goethe laid his Brocken scenein the Thuringian landscape^he could as well have chosen the Inselberg for it A connection with the elemental spirits can befound all over Thiiringia.\" We were waUcing now on a road high above the valley of the Saale. A lovely blue early-summer sky spanned the day, and I could see how profoimdly Rudolf Steiner's senses were open to allthe beauty Mound. Mi^t I still put a few questions? I enquired, lOdand he assented with fatherly kindness. \" Here is the wild rose,\" I said. \" The nature-cure people say they use the inner part for stone in the kidney.\" \"Yes, that is quite true, but look at the red rind of the rose-hip; it has been reddened by cosmic astrality. Make a decoction of this rind....\" He explained in what way the fluid should be used in order to be ' a wonderful remedy' for kid ney complaints. Then he stooped down and from the wayside took a leaf from the rosette of plantago major, the broad-leaved plan tain. He divided the ribs and took out a tiny piece about the size of a- square centimetre. \" If you put 10 or 12 such bits on the salad when it is made, you have a good blood-piuifying remedy for the children of Lauenstein.\" \"Then what is it that is active in the broad-leaved plantain?\" I asked, and to my astonishment I was told,\" Manganese.\" After that we spoke about aesculin and the horse-chestnut, and now I felt I could ask if there were anything in the alchemical methods of the Rosicrucians, the way they made remedies? Per sonally, I did not like the alcohol in the homoeopathic potencies;I had the impression that the remedies became too strongly mummi ed. He went into this question with great warmth and said:\" Undoubtedly this is quite an important matter. One must make a plant extract at a temperature of 37\u00b0 [98-6\u00b0 F .]. The 37\u00b0 is a cos mic heat-entity. If you make an extraction of portions of a plant \u2014leaves, flowers or whatever you like\u2014^for 1-3 days at 37\u00b0, you get 'a very good remedy.\" (Later on various remedies were developed on the lines of this indication.) \"Here is cow-wheat,\"I said, \"with its two complementary coloiurs\u2014^the corona yellow, and the flower itself violet: how is such a thing possible?\" Rudolf Steiner answered: \"That I cannot tell you at the moment.\" This was an example of the way in which Rudolf Steiner investigated such things; if I could have been with him again the next day, the answer might well have been given. All anxiety about the beloved teacher had vanished that day; my worries at ^ster seemed to have been unjustied. Althoughhe kept to a strict diet, he was fresh and apparently quite unbur dened. And when we came again to Domach in September, that month in which he gave over 70 lectures, and I was able to attend the Dramatic Course as well as the one on Pastoral Medicine, there was nothing unusual to be noticed. The question seemed much rather to be: How can we endure all that is offered us? In xm- fathomable fulness the Spirit streamed forth. Every domain which Rudolf Steiner touched became as fresh as dew. Every aspect was cornpletely new: there was no repetition, either in the formulatingor in the train of thought. An overflowing spring poured out its blessings for xis. We drank, and did not guess that we were seeingour T eacher for the last time in his earthly body. Translated by M.C. 101T H E B E G I N N I N G S O F E U R Y T H M Y L o r y M a i e r - S m i t s D u r i n g t h e w i n t e r m o n t h s o f 1 9 0 3 m y m o t h e r h e a r d D r . R u d o l fSteiner speak for the rst time in Dusseldorf. It was a public lecture given in the largest concert hall of the town. My mother, already a member of the Theosophical Society, was so strongly impressed by the personality of the speaker, by the style and contentof the lecture, that she approached Rudolf Steiner with the request Aat he would come regularly and give lectures in Dusseldorf. So it came about that he was a guest and spoke in our house once or twice a year from 1904 onwards. I was eleven years old when I saw him for the rst time. To my sorrow, he addressed me from the irst as 5ie,^ because \"that is what one does in Austria\"; I greatly envied my yoimger sisters whom he often played with and took on his knee. To make up for this, however, I was allowed as early as 1907 to come and listen to a lecture \" in the room \", after he had apparently observed that my listening at the door was not merely a sign of curiosity and love of sensation. I still remember clearly that he spoke about the Rose Cross, and about the two black beams lying in the same directions of space as the human and animal spine; about the red roses, the chaste and passionless blood of the plant; about man, who, because of his desire-enUed blood is, at it were, crucied on these black beams, and has the possibility and the duty to work in such a way as to transform and purify his blood.^ In November, 1911, my father died quite unexpectedly, and two weeks later my mother travelled to Berlin to see Rudolf Steiner after he had expressed his sympathy in a telegram\u2014^\"My thoughts are\"with you\"\u2014at a time when he could not have received the news either by telegram or by letter. She had to wait awhile in his Berlin flat in the Motzstrasse, and while doing so entered into conversation with an acquaintance who told her that her daughter was very happy and successful as a teacher of the Mensendieck system of gymnastics; and this reminded my mother of my wish to study some method of dancing or gym nastics. During her ensuing talk with Rudolf Steiner, he asked her suddenly and apparently on the spur of the moment: \"What is your daughter Lory going to do?\" My mother told him of my wishes and also of the conversation she had just had. \"Yes,\" said Dr. Steiner, \"one can naturally be a good theo- sophist and also practise Mensendieck gymnastics, but the two 1 Sie\u2014^you. In Germany it is customary to say Du (thou) to younger children. 2 Compare the description of the Rose Cross meditation in The Outline of Occult Scietice (the chapter called \" Knowledge of the Higher Worlds \").things have nothing to do with one another. One could, however,build up something of the kind on a theosophical foundation, and I am very willing to show your daughter how this could be done.\" He had already made a similar suggestion to somebody else, but had met with no response. My mother asked whether one could not, by means of rhythmicmovements which stimulate and strengthen the etheric forces, c\u00a3^ forth healthy and healing processes in the human being? This question was to be conrmed some months later, in the indications given for the very first exercises. \"Something stimulating\u2014 hygienic\u2014pedagogical\u2014good for \u2014 against\u2014\". Such rem^ks were frequently written beside the drawings and explanations concerned. In that very rst conversation Dr. Steiner said that this new art of movement would in the rst place have to do with the spoken word, not with music. Thereupon the rst exercise was given: \" Tell your daughter that she should step alliterations; she should take a strong,somewhat stamping step on the alliterated consonants and then make some \"pleasing\" kind of arm movement where this con sonant is absent. While doing this she should think that alliterations really appeared only in the North\u2014Whence in lands where it is very windy. She should picture an old bard and imagine him striding along on the seashore, a lyre under his arm. Each step is a deed,is a battle and a victory over the storm. And then he strikes the strings and makes his song one with the song of the storm.\" In the late autumn my mother returned from Berlin with this gift, but we certainly had no notion that it was to be the intro duction of a new art. And now began the weeks of most beautiful, most earnest expectation, a real Advent time. In Januaiy, 1912, my mother took me with her to Cassel, where Rudolf Steiner was giving lectures, and one day he had time for us also. He lookedat me very kindly, smiling a little. \" Yes, your little daughter must now learn a great deal; afterwards she must forget it all again.\" He then drew up the following plan of study. I was to learn to know the hmnan body with its bones, joints, muscles and ligaments; he recommended for this work an \"Anatomical Atlas for Sculptors\". Secondly, I was to look as much as possible at Greek sculpture, but really only look at it, never try to imitate the actual postures or gestures. I was also to read as much as I could about the Greekdance. He recommended a book by Agrippa von Nettesheim: in this book I would nd drawings in which the human form was portrayed in various geometrical positions. I was to practise jumping quickly from one of the postures to another, and in so doing pay particular attention to the parallel or contrary move ments of arms and legs; on the other hand, I was to take no notice of the planetary and zodiacal signs shown in the drawings. As a wonderful octave to these apparently \" to be forgotten\" things, he gave as the last exercise in the important Eurythmy 102103Course of 1924: Ich denke die Rede . I tliinlr Speech . . Except for a slight change in the order of the movements, geometrical gures appear again here, but now full of content. How signicant and suited to modern consciousness are these postures, with their short accompanying sentences. Then came speech exercises. I was to form sentences containing only one vowel, speak them, and while doing so, observe closelywhat was taking place in my larynx, and this I should then \u2014 dance! As an example, he wrote and spoke the following: Barbara sass stracks am Abhang He drew the line over the sentence, at the same time repeating it once more, strongly accentuating each syllable and bringing out the \u2014a\u2014 (English ah) with special modulation. Bar is a sudden upward movement, a short \u2014a\u2014; ba\u2014ra\u2014sass are three long sounds, the third being especially extended, all three are stretched out on a level; stracks is again a sudden movement, but this time downwards; am Abhang consists of three wave-like movementsI should like here to interpolate a remark which can perhaps throw light oh Rudolf Steiner's procedure in pedagogical matters. He once gave us a very beautiful explanation of the word unterrichten (to teach). Unter-richten means: something is directed, is brought into a right direction, is guided rightly\u2014but below the surface. Children in school are guided; the Professor in a university expounds or lectures. Now I was guided like a child. The child was given a task; she had to practise, practise over and over again (this preparatory work lasted a good six months), and at the same timeunder the surface faculties were awakened that did not come fully to consciousness for a long while, but gradually became part of one's flesh and blood, if I may so express it That this \" above or below, this stretching or curving\", arose throu^ the interplayb e t w e e n v o w e l a n d c o n s o n a n t w a s s o m e t h i n g t h a t h a d t o b e a c t i m l l y experienced and done, not only known. It was certainly betterdone as long as the head could not interfere, and one had only toMk one's heart again and again: \"Now what do you really feel ucrc/This \"asking one's heart\", and letting all one's knowledge and understandng rise up out of its depths, was regarded by RudolfSteiner as a fundamental basis for any artistic Eurythmy work: \"Y ou must leam to let your heart rise up into your head.\" This m e a n s m a k i n g a m o v e m e n t o v e r a n d o v e r a g a i n a n d a l w a y s i i s t e n i n einwardly , for these movements can tell the practising Eurythmistever more and more, can reveal even deeper secrets. Mere head knowledge is of no use here; rst the heart must intuitively sense 104and know; then it can and should rise up into the head also and there become fully conscious. Later he said on one occasion: \"You are doing this quite rightly, but that is not enough; you must know exactly how you are doing it, you must be able to explain it to your pupils also.\" That was in the spring of 1913, when he came to Diisseldorf and we were able to show him what we had learned in the meantime. Then, with regard to one particular exercise he said suddenly to ^ose who were looking on: \"Lory walks quite rightly; she walksjust like a tight-rope dancer, or like a savage in the primeval forest\"It was then that I was called upon to make it clear to myself how I walked in order to explain it to my pupils. It took much time and trouble before this \"had risen up into the head\" and could be clearly formulated as the \" threefold walking\" familiar to-day to every Eurythmy student. This apparently instinctive way of walking correctly must, how ever , have been just one result of his Unter-richtens (guidance belowthe surface). Rudolf Steiner had once shown me two pictures: one represented an Egyptian statue with the strange earth-bound postureof the legs, the other a Greek statue with its characteristic standing posture. At the same time he drew my attention to the dferencebetween these two leg-positions. \"Speaking from the purely human standpoint, the legs and feet would have to bear man's weight equally , as is shown in the Eg3q)tian and early Greek sculptures.And if no other impulse had taken hold of the human being, he would have had to remain always on the same spot, like a plant. However, another impulse enters into him and now he tries torevolt against being earth-bound. One foot begins this revolution and resists the earth, wants to get away from it, withdraws from its force of attraction, and in so doing transfers the whole weight on to the other foot. In this connection, therefore, the essential thing in Greek sculpture is not the standing leg, but, on the contrary , the other leg, which has freed itself from the fetters of the earth.\" And he added laughingly: \" Y ou see, no progress is really possible\u2014even m space\u2014^without Lucifer.\" That was one thing. Besides this, in addition to the speech exercises, other tasks were given: \"And then you must leam towrite with your feet. By doing this one acquires a very delicate feeling in the feet and learns to make intimate, differentiated foot movements.\" I had of course done both these things; I had often Med to experience and inwardly to become aware of the contrast between the Egyptian leg-and-foot position and the \" standing-leg \"of &e Greeks. I had also practised writing with my feet a great deal, and so the correct way of walking\u2014\"walking like a tight-rope dancer\"\u2014was to some extent already the fruit of these efforts\u2014that is to say , the result of his guidance {seines Unterrichtens), Rudolf Steiner had never given indications for Eurythmic walking, had never even stressed the necessity of trying to discover 105how to do it. But it seems to me that he had done everything to prepare for it, so that this walking was called forth, apparently \"instinctively\". And a clear indication that our later formulationwas the right one is that in the last lecture-course, given in July, 1924,* it was used word for word. * * * * I devoted the following year, from January till July, 1912, to tMs preparatory work. I read about the Greek dance, but I soon discovered that the real object of my research was not to be found. Dr . Steiner had spoken about Mystery Dances. But only one scanty allusion by Lucianus pointed in this direction: \"And then there were also Mystery Dances, but about these it is not permitted to speak, for that would mean introducing Mystery Dancing amongthe people and the consequence would be death!\" It had also occmred to the philologist Kirchhoff that one could i^d no in formation in Greek literature about this art of dancing, although there were frequent references to it. He was of the opinion that the Greeks made no use of such information because they could read the movements from the text. Everything that he reconstructed with regard to rhythms and steps was fully recognised by Rudolf Steiner and incorporated in the work for the development of foot movements, but completed by corresponding movements for the arms and hands. I tried further, with the aid of diagrams in the \"Anatomical Atlas for Artists\", to study one joint after another, with all the muscles and ligaments, and to experiment with all this in my own body , in order to achieve a more conscious relationship to physical body and its possibilities of movement.From the next task, the looking at Greek works of art, there arose a completely different experience, especially when I was able to look at the actual works themselves, not only at their pictorial representations. In the face of this divine beauty\u2014repose, yetwithin this repose flowing movement\u2014I felt my own bodily organisation in a new and different way. I had a dawning sense of being at home in my own body, in a way that was justiable,indeed god-willed. It was even possible to shut one's eyes and still feel how one's breathing was different, how the blood flowed and pulsated in a different way. On\u00a9 felt like a plant which had been growmg in dusty, parched earth, and had begun to droop and fadewithout water in the heat, but was now watered and permeated with new life right into the smallest leaves and bres. Was it a delicate, as yet unrecognised perception of one's own etheric bodyin face of these works of art from the time of the most beautiful, harmonious, penetrating grasp of the physical body? We are Greeks no longer; our physical body has become harder and heavier; our etheric body is rmly imprisoned within it and is no longer perceptible. Nothing of essential value would be gained by * \" Eurythmy as Visible Speech,\" Domach, 1924. 106however faithful an imitation of the gestures and movements of Greek works of art. We modems must train ourselves to experience our etheric body as the rst supersensible member of our being, at home in the last, the lowest heaven; we must nd the way again into the higher heaven out of which it has descended. The way to this re-ascent was shown to us. One of the keys was given by Rudolf Steiner with the ten or twelve drawings done by his own hand, which he entrusted to a nineteen-year-old girl. TTiey were the foundation of a completely new art, an art which can awaken the very stiongest impulses and quicken healthy , harmonious forces, having their source in the supersensible structure of the human being. July came, and in July the rehearsals began for the MunichFestival Plays.* I was allowed to be present during these weeks and was given instruction myself. When my mother and I arrived, work had already begun on Rudolf Steiner's new, third Mystery Play, Der Huter der Schwelle (\"The Guardian of the Threshold\"). Something completely new, taking all participants by surprise, wasincluded in one of the scenes: Beings were to appear on the stage and these beings were \"to dance\". Just as I entered the hall, a big gymnasium which had been taken for the rehearsals, thesedances were being practised. Luciferic and Ahrimanic beings were represented, who, according to Rudolf Steiner's stage directions,carried out dance-like movements corresponding to the thought- forms, to the words of Lucifer and Ahriman. The movements and forms cannot be elucidated within the framework of this essay; nevertheless, it was the rst Eurythmy which was shown, althou^ nobody knew that this new art would develop out of it. I waited from day to day until Dr. Steiner should send for me and the lessons begin. At last I met him one day as he was coming out of a door. Perhaps I looked at him questioningly and expectantly; in any case he laid his hand on my shoulder and said, \"Yes, little one, the wisdom of the whole world is involved\u2014I cannot tell you yet. I cannot spare the time that I need during these weeks. Would it be possible for you to come to me in September when I am in Basle ? Then I shall have time.\" How ever, the day before our departure from Munich, my mother and Ihad a sxuT)rise. We were sent for by Rudolf Steiner, and during our conversation that evening he gave the rst concrete indications about three vowels. He said approximately the following:\" Stand quite upright and try to feel like a pillar from the balls of the feet up into the head; this pillar, this upright position you miKt leam to experience as /\" (English E). I believe he was not satised with what I tried to do, for he called, while I was still doing my best: \" The weight rests on the balls of the feet, not onthe heels.\" Now it went, more or less. I stood in the given position I . *Y eMly conferences (I907-I913) were held by the then Theosophical,later the Anthroposophical Society, with courses of lectures and performances of dramas by Eduard Schurd and Rudolf Steiner. 107and felt all at once how, starting from the balls of the feet, some thing streamed upwards, as it were, into the vertical. I experiencedit in front of my body as though it were carrying breast and heart up into the forehead, the latter seeming as though it must becomewarm and begin to shine. \"Now change the position of this pillar so that the head is further back than the feet, and then you have the posture which you must learn to feel as A \" (English Ah). This was a completely different experience. The weight is transferred to the heels; ^e pillar rises upwards as though outside the body and yet maintainingits upright position. It takes hold of and penetrates the vertebral column so that one now has a denite experience of the bony system and therewith a certain sensation of weight, of being bound to the earth. To make up for this, however, the breast and heart are, as it were, opened to all inuences. The whole world and the whole heavens send their rays into me. And all these rays meet in the heart. In comparison with what is experienced in connection with the rst position, there is now a slight sense of pain, of being affected by something one is open to, and also at the mercy of the outer world.\" And now Comes the third position; For this, bring the top of the head of the pillar in front of the spot where the feet are standing; you will learn to feel this as O.\" Again there was a considerable difference between this and the rst two sounds, when practice taught me to experience it. Out of the A (Ah), out of this feeling of being plunged down into the physical body, until one experiences the spine, the ribs; until one becomes actually aware that the arms are really ribs which have made themselves free and are not just appendages\u2014 out of this A one passes through the I (E), which is the experience of gravity being overcome in the vertical, to the O. There then arises in a delicate and yet convincing way the feeling that the sentient soul, released from the constraint of the body, can experience itself outside, in the \" otherness\" to which this slightly inclining gesture draws it near. Through this exercise the astral body, the third member of the human organisation\u2014^the instrumentof Eurythmy\u2014is called into activity, and a first delicate conscious ness is thereby awakened of how the sentient soul can unite itself in a threefold way with its own body and with the outer world. * * * * There was about a fortnight between the weeks devoted to the Munich Drama Festival and the course of lectures given in Basle on the Gospel of St. Mark. A kindly Providence, one might almost say an artistic intervention of Destiny, made it possible for me to putthis time to good use by absorbing the most varied impressions of Nature in the mountains, by the Bavarian lakes, on Lake Constance and by visiting the Rhine waterfall. Added to this, changing weather conditions contributed to ever new and in part strongly contrastingmoods and humours which took possession of my young heart, made doubly sensitive by the weeks spent in Munich: moods of astonishment, of wonder, of reverence, and also a somewhat anxious feeling of being overwhelmed. And so, on the 14th September, we arrived in Basle. On the very rst evening, after the lecture, Rudolf Steiner made an appointment for us the next morning at Bottmingen, a country suburb. Cm: daily journey thither led us through gay autumn flowers and rustling trees along the side of a stream until we reached the little house where Rudolf Steiner was living during his stay in Basle. He received us in a tiny little room on the ground floor. There were a couple of chairs in this room, and a small sofa on which Rudolf Steiner always sat. Only a very little space was left. On our rst two visits we were with him alone; on the third day we were joined by Marie von Sivers\u2014^later Frau-Marie Steiner\u2014and Dr. Steiner said with a smile: \"Yes, now Fraulein von Sivers is also interested in our affair. She has asked me how I could possibly show all the \" steps \" in this little room!\" On the first Monday afternoon\u2014it was the 16th September, 1912\u2014^after a short, affectionate greeting, Rudolf Steiner entered immediately into the primal, most fundamental basis of Eurythmy\u2014the vowels. \"You must leam to acquire a fine, differentiated feeling for the individual soimds. And for this you must learn to let your heart rise up into your head. First, the heart must speak and later the head. . . . Learn to feel A (Ah) as a defence. Leam to feel O as a loving embrace, 17 as a tending upwards, shown by big arm movements when in serious vein, but in lighter mood by a spring.\" Dr. Steiner gave not only all the vowels, but also the modied vowels' and diphthongs during this rst lesson at Bottmingen; and in addition he gave a slight indication as to how one should work. First one should try to make each single sound into an experience; then one should combine two sounds, for instance I (E), O; then three sounds, I (E), O, U (OO); and then, taking this order of sounds, let one pass over into the other, \"forming the movements almost at the same time\". \"You will see how beautiful this is and how a differentiated experience is expressed by this means.\" There was such a ring of expectant joy in his voice\u2014^so much expectant joy that the unforgettable sound was always a help, supporting one when later on difculties arose in the work, or when times of painful flatness came along. At the end of the rst afternoon Dr. Steiner spoke about three consonants. He had impressed upon me that one must feel, and Uve through and with, the vowels in their tendencies towards move ment\u2014stretching, seizing, bending, crossing, striving. The souldoes indeed live in all this activity and expresses itself in ever- var5dng ways. \"The whole realm of the soul is portrayed, as faras the feeling life is concerned, in the vowels.\" Over against this 108 109weaving life of pure soul were now placed three specic consonants;with these, something belonging to the outer world is made use of, for we \"have something in our hand\". One's whole attention, all one's adaptability, must now be focussed on this \" something \", this object. The realm of the vowels was blotted out, that realm inwhich the soul expresses what it experiences as strange and hence astonishing; what it experiences as purest consciousness of self in the upright posture; what it experiences as loving inclination towards an object of admiration and wonder; what it experiences, when cold and forsaken, it turns to a Higher and a Greater. With Ae consonants something taken from the outer world was given into man's keeping, and one must adapt oneself to it, to its nature and character; one must give oneself over to a completely different element, imitating, copying, reforming what is outside oneself in the outer world. Warmth of feeling and a sense of truth must be developed when expressing the vowels; with the consonants onemust become skilful, clever, quick-witted. It woxdd be impossible to relate in detail all that happened during those September days, for this would offer a perspective ofsuch richness that even to-day it has not by any means been explored in all its possibilities and consequences. This rst part of Eurythmy is now called \"Dionysian Eurythmy\". In the case of most of the group or round dances, the indications originally given used to place the gure of Dionysus in the centre of the circle, and for two round dances, in particular. Dr. Steiner gave the following explanation: \" Had one passed by a temple dedicated to Dionysus shortly before the outbreak of war, one would have heard thecharacteristic cry with which Dionysus inspired the warriors in a denite, cultic dance. For us, this is the 'Energy-Dance', which gives strength for working in common with others. After the battlethe second cty could have been heard, the purpose of which was to calm and bring peace once more to the souls excited by warfare.\" Dr. Steiner called this second dance the \" Peace-Dance \". Nearly all such dances had to be carried out in the anapaestic rhythm Dr. Steiner showed me himself how the call of Dionysus should be given, for both the Energy Dance and the Peace Dance, by makinguse of the three Dionysian sounds, I (E), E (A), U (OO). At the same time he tapped the anapaest pointedly with a pencil, so pointedly that the top of the case sprang off. He put it on againand began afresh; a second and third time it sprang off\u2014but ever since then I know: it must be an anapaest! In this way I had also received the answer to the question about the Mystery Dances of the Greeks, not to be found in books. Then came forms for the personal pronouns\u2014^for I, thou, he and their plurals. It is reaUy most delightful every now and again to look over lyrical poems and see how many of them can be expressed\" in a completely satisfying way when one takes this particular point of view into consideration. As a further step, nopoems should be studied with a view to discovering whether they express the thinking, feeling or willing soul, and the forms shouldbe designed accordingly. TTiinking demands straight lines; willing, rounded forms; and feeling, a combination of both. Each calls for a quite different spatial experience, a different way of lling and feeling space. And so we had the possibility, even then, of ex periencing what Rudolf Steiner was later to work out more in detailin one of his lectures\u2014that thinking takes place in the first dimen sion, feeling in the second, and willing in the third. Thus, in the very rst beginnings, there was the possibility already of verifying the truth of what Rudolf Steiner said in his introductory words on the occasion of the founding of this new art: \" This new art of move-'Hment is intended to be the means whereby things which demand a | too intensive attention from the onlooker, or are so deep that their ; full signicance cannot be expressed in words, may be imparted to / the understanding of the onlooker in this new way.\" On the last of these days in Bottmingen, Dr. Steiner gave me two special pieces of advice. The rst was pedagogical, the only advice of this kind that he ever gave me. He said more or less in these words: \"Now when you have learned all this and go out into\" the world to bring it to other people, and you are confronted with a pupil who makes, let us say, six mistakes, do me the favour of telling him only of the seventh. Y ou were present recently at the rehearsals in Munich and you will have seen that I actually say or correct very little, and yet people do everything as I would have it in the end.\" J The second piece of advice was the following: \"When you go\"\" into the world and teach people, you must let them pay, and pay well, for their lessons. This new art of movement has been taken by force majeure from Ahriman, and he must have its equivalent.\" I do not wish to pass over these words in silence, because I believe they are of importance to many, not only to Eurythmists. Experienceshows that when somebody lacking a sense of responsibility has lightheartedly made a \" gift\" of Eurythmy, it has never proved tobe fruitful in the right sense of the word. And then in September, 1912, at the last lesson in Bottmingen, the new art received its name. When Rudolf Steiner said somewhat meditatively and thoughtfully, \"Now we must name for thisaffair of ours,\" Fraulein von Sivers said quite spontaneously and naturally, \" Eutythmy \", and to this name Dr. Steiner agreed whole heartedly and immediately. If mothers ought to know the names of the children who come down to them, then Marie Steiner-von Sivers was, in this connection also,\" the mother \" of Eurythmy. The days passed all too quickly; we returned home and the work began. * * * * At the end of April, 1913, when Dr. Steiner came again to give lectures in Diisseldorf, he visited us also, and soon after lunch we assembled in a large room decorated with fresh young birch 111 CB-8boughs, and showed him what we had learned up to that time: Ema Wolfram, Anne-marie Donath, my younger sisters and I. The six others wore pale green dresses, a \"Dionysian green\"; I myself wore white. For the rod exercise, the rst we had worked out in dijfferent rhythms, we used wooden rods bound round with copper wire. In Bottmingen Dr. Steiner had given us this advice: \" If it is difcult to obtain copper rods, let us use wooden ones, bound round with copper wire. But it must be copper, for that imparts an inner certainty to the movements; one wiU move rightly by instinct, onewill handle things pmirasefully\u2014^for instance, one will go to a bookshelf and at once pick out the right book.\" We began with alliterations, and metrically rhythmic exercises. In both cases Rudolf Steiner required a very marked acceleration, and with one dactyl\u2014it was the chorxis from \"Pandora\"\u2014he took the book from my mother's hand\u2014she had been reciting\u2014and spoke himself. I believe I have never heard anybody else speak so quickly, and yet with siich control and such clear accentuation. At rst we showed the rhythm with our arms and legs, then, as it became quicker and quicker, it was no longer possible to make a \"beautiful and exact\" dactyl: one was nothing but a dactyl, there was absolutely nothing else, one was caught up in an actual hap pening, in a living reality. It was a powerful experience, and I re-experienced it with the same intensity when Rudolf Steinercalled for a similar acceleration of tempo in the later \"Curative Eurythmy Course \". Many of the exercises given there should be carried out \"quickly,.quicker, still quicker\", and only rarely is one expressly told: \"This exercise should not be taken so quickly, and between-whiles there must always be pauses.\" The acceleration of tempo is actually a means whereby one's own clever head is to some extent put out of action, and in its place the actual power of the sound can make itself felt. Naturally, well-considered, careful preparatory work must precede any such acceleration. We then proceeded to show other rod exercises, and especially one with which we had taken considerable pains because its purpose was to correct bad habits of posture, and it was therefore very necessary for us all. As soon as we had nished, Rudolf Steiner took a rod himself and showed us various ways of holding and catching it, with movements which \"may also prove to be very health-giving and efcacious\". He showed great pleasure in all this, attempted the most difficult \"catches\" with the rod\u2014^which often fell to the ground\u2014and the rest of us were all very busy imitating him, picking up the rod and trying again, letting it fall and picking it up. We were extremely happy and fuU of zest; and when we showed our \"prepared work\", taking one exercise after the other, in the same order as earlier in Bottmingen, he was glad and pleased too, and he took a very kind and positive attitude towards our efforts. He pointed out little unimportant things to those who were looking on. \"Just see how charmingly little Thearuns backwards!\" Or when I drew eights and spirals on the floor with chalk for my pupils, \" It really is something to be able to do that so dexterously.\" For one form we had been able to find no suitable text\u2014^it was the form for the pronoun \"he\"\u2014^but this proved fortunate for us.\" I see, what you need are the words\u2014^I will compose them for you.\" After a few moments' sUence and reflection, he called us three \" big ones \". We had to stand in a small circle, our faces turned to the centre, and he then sjpoke in a resonant, powerful voice the rst poem composed especially for Eurythmy, at the same time directing our movements in space: H e w h o i l l u m i n a t e s t h e c l o u d s , D e r W o l k e n d u r c h l e u c h t e r , M a y h e i l l u m i n a t e , E r d u r c h l e u c h t e . M a y h e i r r a d i a t e , E r d u r c h s o n n e . M a y h e i n s p i r e , E r d u r c h g l i i h e . And ll with warmth and light, Er durchwarme. Even me. Audi mich. We repeated it several times, and I believe all of us, onlookers and performers, had the same experience\u2014^now true Eurythmy is born; in its sacramental and forming power it has become alive. He then gave us new tasks, and, turning over the leaves of an anthology of lyrical poems, chose after some search a little poem by Richard Dehmel, Hieroglyphe, which begins with three very inter esting rhymed couplets. This brought our \" lesson \" to an end. Dr. Steiner, who was accompanied by Fraulein WaUer and Frau Helene Roehling, then took his leave, for he had to give a lecture in Dusseldorf the same evening. I do not relate what follows for any personal reason, but simply to describe his greatness of heart, his kindness and never-failing support. He took my hand in both his own and . . . thanked me. When, disconcerted and completely taken aback, I stammered, \" But, Herr Doktor, it is we who must thank you!\" he again took my hand and repeated: \"No, I thank you.\" And yet again, before he got into the car, there was a pressure of the hand and \" I thank you In this way, with all his simple greatness and sustaining warmth, he gave us an example of the virtue of gratitude, so largely lost to-day. * * * * ' During the whole of May, 1914, several of us. Flossy von Sonklar (later Frau Leinhas), Elizabeth Dollfuss (later Frau Baumaim), Ada Smits and I were in London. I gave lessons every day, and moreover I gave them in English. T o make this possible, Mr. Collison had tried, together with me, to translate what was most necessary into English. This was not achieved without con flict, for when I had translated something, he said it was not English, and when he translated, I said it was not Eurythmy.^ The outbreak of war interrupted the Eurythmy classes, owing to difculties of travel. In the summer of 1915, however, I was 112113able to get a passport and go to Switzerland. Just at that time Rudolf Steiner gave the so-called second part of Eurythmy, the ApoUinian, in a course in which Frau Kisseljeff, Bma Wolfram,and Elizabeth DoUfuss took part. For many exercises. Dr. Steiner needed larger groups, and other Domach Eurythmists joined in these. In this course* a new second world of Eurythmy was revealed: to the creative ery-radiant Dionysus, arising out of one's own soul, there came now Apollo with his formative forces, drawn from a more objective spirituality. The movements in space of this Apollonian Eurythmy were based on the grammatical character ofthe single words, and even the representation of dramatic situations followed strict and clear-cut laws. With all this we had a programme of work which needed several years to be fully assimilated and developed. It lay in my personal destiny that I was not able to take part in the further development of Eurythmy in Domach for about two years. During this time Dr. Steiner began to give individual forms for poems. These forms, described by him as \"Standard Forms\", were \"forms which, when worked out, brought to expression the individual characteristics of a poem \". At the beginning of the last year of the war, 1918, Rudolf Steiner gave some lectures in Nuremberg in which I, too, was able to participate. During these days a quite small Eurythmy demon stration was arranged for a private circle of intimate friends. It had to be small, for Frau Marie Steiner-von Sivers and I bore the whole brunt of it. Added to this, Frau Marie Steiner had a bad cold, and was so hoarse after the rehearsal that she feared she would not be able to recite in the afternoon. Rudolf Steiner promised to read for her should this be necessary. But it was not necessary. She managed the whole programme, and her voice became ever freer and better. \" You see, one must always try, then somehow things go all right,\" said Dr. Steiner to her afterwards. After a few words about my perfonnance, he gave me a vivid account of the Eurythmy in Domach, which I had not seen for a long time, as I had been prevented by war conditions from travel ling. \"Yes, Eurythmy has really taken a big step forward in thelast weeks. At last we have succeeded in putting a humorous poem on the stage; the Gebratene Plunder (the \"Roasted Flounder\") by Peter Schlemil, from Simplicissimus. The roasted flounder itself appears, as well as the burning oil lamp, the yellow silk family sofaand the rocking chair. In the end the lamp is knocked over and there is a terrible set-out! But, you see, this really means con siderable progress in Eurythmy, and we shall work out many things along these lines. I should like always to have a humorouslast part in our programmes.\" * The content of the course, which was not published, is rendered in \"Fundamentals of Eurythmy\", by A. Dubach-Donath, 1928.How important humour and satire were to him I experiencedsome years later in Domach. I was doing one of Nietzsche s most beautiful poems, Liebeserkldrung (\"Declaration of Love). It is addressed to the albatross, whose lofty flight is described with wonder and longing. The poem ends with these words: O wmged albatross, my ceaseless impulses drive me up towards the heighte\u2014 I think of thee; then my tears flow\u2014yes, I love thee. Rudoli Steiner saw it in the rehearsal and was pleased; I was to do it atthe next performance in the Goetheanum (the building was alre^y open). \" Only ,\" he said, \" there is one thing you have not noticed.He pointed to the epilogue, in small print: \"With which, however,the poet fell into a ditch.\" \" Now , I have drawn a coda {Nach'takt) for you. Leave everything just as you have done it, but then, when you have held the last posture for a moment, plunge quite suddenly into this silent Nach-takt\"' Now for what followed: The last posture at the end of the poem was one which bore heart, soul and all the forces of the will upwards to \"star and eternity\". Then came the Nach-takU an angular, straight-lined form with abrupt changes of direction, and in orderto illustrate the position a little gure was drawn at the side: toe upper part of the body had to be bent forwards almost in a right-angle, and the arms drawn backwards on a level with toe head.The entire form of the Nach-takt was to be danced in this posture. I practised most diligently , but nevertheless at the dress rehearsal I was overtaken by mischance\u2014and took a seat in toe middle of the stage, just when I should have been leaving it by running backwards on the last line of toe form. This pleased Dr. Steiner so much that from then on I had to practise this sitting down, and had even to remain seated until the curtain fell. We then went on tour with toe programme, and I took a seat in the middle of the stoge m Stuttgart, in Dresden, in Leipzig, in Halle, and flnally in Berlin.In Berlin this drew spontaneous applause; it was only in Berlin that the audience immediately grasped the humour of the situation. One person alone could naturally practise sitting down sud denly , but how about two? We were doing Seance from Goetl^ sParabolisch. In this humorous poem toe letters of toe mphabet make their appearance; the vowels, clad in scarlet, take the seats of honour; the consonants, walking with stiff steps, i^ake a more modest entry and have their places allotted to them by President A.* ... It was just at this point of toe poem that it happened. * Hier Baravalle and I were the consonants S and L, and we had to cross the stage with quite stiff legs making an S form, one from left to right, the other from right to left. All went well in the rehearsals, but at the performance our legs became entangled\u2014 and right and left . . . our places were indeed allotted to us! A roar of applause! Naturally, we both jumped up again and went on. Behind the stage\u2014our Seance was one of the last numbers\u2014our\" interlude \" gave rise to eager chatter and laughter. Rudolf Steiner joined us and laughed as heartily as the rest. \" We can never doit again,\" he said, \"for the audience will naturally expect you to repeat your performance and you will not be able to do it The way you both fell\u2014it was an absolute hit; and it came at the one right moment! The way you sprang up again, and went on, and everything absolutely together! Such symmetry! It was simply magnicent But we can never do it again.\" And indeed fromthat time the Seance was cut out of the programme. In conclusion\u2014in order that my contribution to this collection may have some slight correspondence to a Eurythmy Programme, which should end with a humorous part\u2014I should lUce to describe just one more humorous number. One day Frau Marie Steiner brought us a form which Rudolf Steiner had just drawn for the Hystrix, a poem from the Galgenlieder by Christian Morgenstem. She asked me if I would like to study it Not only were &e forms very interesting, but very exact and strange directions were written by the side of them. \"The whole thing is to be danced with the feet turned inwards, and the legs must often be crossed one over the other, making an E (A). Besides this, the upper part of the body should be waggled from left to right and from right to left.The head should often be turned round and round like a top.\" I was naturally thrilled and set to work with great delight, but my pleasure very soon vanished and gave place to a positively dreadful, terrifying experience. Even by carrying out the rst two indications\u2014feet turned inwards and legs crossed in an J? (A)\u2014 one had the feeling that the arms had become long, heavy and unfree. The upright human posture was lost! And when, added to this, there came the waggling of the upper part of the body, and the top-like turning of the head, the human form was completely broken up, blotted out\u2014nay, changed into its opposite. It was really an animal that stood there! I felt changed, even in the very form of my face; I no longer had a mouth; the lower jaw was pushed forward and transformed into tiie miuaie of an animal..; at any moment, I might foam at the mouth. The chaingft i felt in my face was particularly horrible, and I looked once more throughthe directions given with the forms. What did I nd ? The very rst direction referred to the costume and began as follows: \"With a pale blue veil thrown over the head . . .\" So Rudolf Steiner had foreseen that it would be necessary to throw a protective veil over this somewhat too crass metamorphosis. It would reaUy not havebeen possible without this veil. But the veil was there, and some thing else was there besides. The wagging to and fro of the upper part of the body and the top-like turning of the head were to stopwith the last verse and during the whole of the nal silent form (Nach-takt), so that from the outset indications were given for a Himinighing of the \" non-human \" element and a return to a certainmeasure of equilibrium. The longer I worked at this task, the clearer it became to me, that in the long run it could be mastered only with \" humour \". Rudolf Steiner recommended humour to us as a most necessary equipment for every artist Once, in answer to a question from awoman painter, he dened it as the \" controlling power of the soul\" (beherrschende Seelenkraft). On a higher level- it was given artistic form in that being whom Rudolf Steiner himself called \" Cosmic Humour\", and for whom\u2014^in order to achieve \"balance\"\u2014^hefound a place in the grouping of the gures in that great work of art which he carved in wood and called the Representative of Humanity.Translated by V, C-B, 116117N E W D I R E C T I O N S I N A G R I C U L T U R E Ehrenfried E. Pfeiffer r > I 1 9 2 2 / 2 3 E r n s t S t e g e m a n n a n d a g r o u p o f o t h e r f a r m e r s w e n tto ask Rudolf Steiner's advice about the increasing degeneration they had noticed in seed-strains and in many cultivated plants. What can be done to check this decline and to improve the quality of seed and nutrition ? That was their question. They brought to his attention such salient facts as the following: Crops of lucerne used commonly to be grown in the same eld for as many as thirty years on end. The thirty years dwindled to nine, then to seven. Tlien the day came when it was considered quite an achievement to keep this crop growing in the same spot for even four or ve years. Farmers used to be able to seed new crops year after year from their own rye. wheat, oats and barley. Now they were nding that they had to resort to new strains of seed every few years. New strains were being produced in bewildering pro fusion, only to disappear from the scene again in short order. A second group went to Dr. Steiner in concern at the increase in animal diseases, with problems of sterility and tiie widespread foot-and-mouth disease high on the list. Among those in this group were the veterinarian Dr. Joseph Werr, the physician Dr. Eugen Kolisko, and members of the staff of the newly established Weleda, the pharmaceutical manufactming enterprise. Count Carl von Keyserlingk brought problems from still another quarter. Then Dr. Wachsmuth and the present writer went to Dr. Steiner with questions dealing particularly with the etheric natiure of plants, and with formative forces in general. In reply to a question about plant diseases. Dr. Steiner told the writer that plantsthemselves could never be diseased in a primary sense, \" since they are the products of a healthy etheric world.\" They suffer rather from diseased conditions in their environment, especially in the soil; the causes of so-called plant diseases should be sought there. Ernst Stegemann was given special indications as to the point of viewfrom which a farmer could approach his task, and was shown some rst steps in the breeding of new plant types as a rst impetus towards the subsequent establishment of the biological-dynamic movement In 1923 Rudolf Steiner described for the rst time how to make the bio-dynamic compost preparations, simply giving the recipe without any sort of explanation\u2014just \"do this and then that\" Dr. Wachsmuth and I then proceeded to make the rst batch of preparation 500. This was then biuried in the garden of the\"Sonnenhof\" in Arlesheim, Switzerland. The momentous day came in the early summer of 1924 when this rst lot of 500 was dug up again in the presence of Dr. Steiner, Dr. Wegman, Dr.Wachsmuth, a few other co-workers and myself. It was a sunny afternoon. We began digging at the spot where memory, aided by a few landmarks, prompted us to search. We dug on and on. The reader will understand that a good deal more sweating was done over the waste of Dr. Steiner's time than over the strenuousness of the labour. Finally he became impatient and tmrned to leave for a ve o'clock appointment at his studio. The spade grated on the rst cowhom in the very nick of time. Dr. Steiner turned back, called for a pail of water, and proceeded to show us how to apportion the horn's contents to the water, and the correct way of stirring it. As the author's walking-stick was the only stirring implement at hand, it was pressed into service. Rudolf Steiner was particularly concerned wiA demonstrating the energetic stirring, the forming of a funnel or crater, and the rapid changing of direction to make a whirlpool. Nothing was said aboutthe possibility of stirring with the hand or with a birch-whisk. Brief directions followed as to how the preparation w^ to be sprayed when the stirring was nished. Dr. Steiner then indicatedwith a motion of his hand over the garden how large an area &e available spray would cover. Such was the momentous occasion marking the birth-hour of a world-wide agricultural movement. What impressed me at the time,, and still gives one much to think about, was how these step-by-step developments illustrate Dr. Steiner's practical way of working. He never proceeded from preconceived abstract dogma, but always dealt with the concrete given facts of the situation. There was such germinal potency inhis indications that a few sentences or a short paragraph often sufced to create the foundation for a farmer's or scientist's whole life-work; the agricultural comrse is full of such instances. A study of his indications can therefore scarcely be thorough enough. One does not have to try to puzzle them out, but can simply follow them to the letter. Dr. Steiner once said, with an understanding smile, in another, very grave situation, that there were two types of people engagedin anthroposophical work: the oioer ones, who understood every- I thing, but did nothing with it. and the younger ones, who under-stood only partially or not at all, but immediatelv put suggesnons into practice. We obviously trod the younger path m tne agri cultural movement, which did all its learning in the hard school of experience. Only now does the total picture of the new impulse given by Rudolf Steiner to agriculture stand clearly before us, eventhough we still have far to go to exhaust all its possibilities. Accomplishments to date are merely the rst step. Every day brings new experience and opens new perspectives. \u00bb * * * Shortly before 1924 Count Keyserlingk set to work in deadearnest to persuade Dr. Steiner to give an agricultural course. As Dr. Steiner was already overwhelmed with work, tours and lectures. 118119he put off his decision from week to week. The undaunted Countthen dispatched his nephew to Domach. with orders to camp on Dr. Steiner's doorstep and refuse to leave without a denite com- tnitment for the course. This was nally given. The agricultural course was held from June 7 to 16, 1924, in the hospitable home of Count and Countess Keyserlingk at Koberwitz near Breslau. It was followed by further consultations and lecturesin Breslau, among them the famous \"Address to Y outh.\" I myself had to forgo attendance at the course, as Dr. Steiner had asked me to stay at home to help take care of someone who was seriously ill. \" Til write and tell you what goes on at the course,\" Dr. Steinersaid by way of solace. He never did get round to writing, no doubt because of the heavy demands on him; this was understood and regretfully accepted. On his return to Domach, however, there wasan opportunity for discussing the general situation. When I asked hini whether the new methods should be started on an experimental b^is, he replied: \" The most important thing is to make the benetsof our agricultural preparations available to the largest possible areas over the entire earth, so that the earth may be healed and thenutritive quality of its produce improved in every respect That should be our rst objective. The experiments can come later.\" He obviously thought that the proposed methods should be applied at once. This can be understood against the backgroimd of a conversationI had with Dr . Steiner en route from Stuttgart to Domach shortly before the agricultural course was given. He had been speaking of the need for a deepening of esoteric life, and in this connection mentioned certain faults typically foxmd in spiritual movements. I then asked, \"How can it happen that the spiritual impulse, and especially the inner schooling, for which you are constantly pro viding stimulus and guidance bear so little ruit? Why do the people concerned give so little evidence of spiritual experience, inspite of all their efforts? Why, worst of all, is the will for action.fQr_the capying out of these spiritual impulses, sn wflalr'l\" T^ac particularly anxious to get an answer to the question as to how onecould build a bridge to active participation and the carrying out of spiritual intentions without being pulled off the right path by personal ambition, illusions and petty jealousies; for these were the negative qualities Rudolf Steiner had named as the main inn^rhindrances. Then came the thought-provoking and surprising Mswer: \" This is a problem of nutrition. Nutrition as it is to-dav dggOat supply the strength necessary for manaestme the .snrnTinPhysical nte. a bndge can no longer be built frnm thiningV ^ and action. Food plants no longer contain the forces people need for this.\" A nutritional problem which, if solved, would enable the spirit to become manifest and realise itself in human beings! With this as a background, one can understand why Dr. Steiner said that 120\"the benets of the bio-dynamic compost preparations should be made available as quickly as possible to the largest possible areas of the entire earth, for the earth's healing.\" This puts the Koberwitz agricultural course in proper perspective as an introduction to understanding spiritual, cosmic forces and making them effective again in the plant world. In discussing ways and means of propagating the methods. Dr. Steiner said also that the good effects of the preparations and of the whole method itself were \"for everybody, for all farmers\"\u2014^in other words, not intended to be the special privilege of a small, select group. This needs to be the more emphasised in view of the fact that admission to the course was limited to farmers, gardeners and scientists who had both practical experience and a spiritual- scientic, anthroposophical background. The latter is essential to understanding and evaluating what Rudolf Steiner set forth, but the bio-dynamic method can be applied by any farmer. It is important to point this out, for later on many people came to believe that only anthroposophists can practice toe bio-dynaimc method. On toe other hand, it is certainly true that a grasp of bio- dynamic practices gradually opens up a wholly new perspective ontoe world, and that toe practitioner acquires and applies a kind of judgment in dealing with biological\u2014^i.e. living\u2014^processes and facts which is different from that of a more materialistic chemical farmer; he follows nature's dynamic play of forces with a greater degree of interest and awareness. But it is also true that there isa considerable difference between mere application of toe method and creative participation in toe work. From toe rst, actual practice has been closely bound up with toe work of toe spiritual centre of toe movement, toe Natural Science Section of toe Goetoeanum at Domach. This was to be toe source, toe creative, fmctifying spiritual elemient; while toe practical workers broughtback their results and their questions. The name, \"Bio-Dynamic Agricultural Method,\" did not originate with Dr. Steiner, but with toe experimental circle concerned with toe practical application of toe new direction of thought. In toe Agricultural Course, which was attended by some sixty persons, Rudolf Steiner set forth toe basic new way of thinkingabout the relationship of earth and soil to toe formative forces of toe etoeric. astral and ego activity of nature. He pointed out particularly how toe health of soil, plants and animals depends upon bringing nature into connection again with toe cosmic creative, shaping forces. The practical method he gave for treating soU,manure and compost, and especially for making toe bio-dynamic compost preparations, was intended above all to serve toe purposeof reanimating toe natural forces which in nature ^d in modem agriculture were on toe wane. \" This must be achieved in actual practice,\" Rudolf Steiner told me. He showed how much it meantto him to have the School of Spiritual Science going hand in hand with real-life practicality when he spoke on another occasion of wanting to have teachers at the School alternate a few years of teaching (three years was the period mentioned) with a subsequent ^riod of three years spent in work outside, so that bythis alternation they would never get out of touch with the con ditions and challenges of real life. The circle of those who had been inspired by the agricultural course and were now working both practically and scientically at this task kept on growing: one thinks at once of Guenther Wachsmuth, Jakobi, Otto Eckstein, Hans Heinze, and of many others who came into the movement with the passing of time, including Dr. Werr, the rst veterinarian. The bio-dynamic move ment developed out of the co-operation of practical workers with the Natural Science Section of the Goetheanum. Before long it had spread to Austria, Switzerland, Italy, England, France, the north- European countries and the United States. T o-day no part of theworld is without active collaborators in this enterprise. * * * * The bio-dynamic school of thought and a chemically-minded agricultural thinking confronted one another from opposite points of the compass at the time the agricultural course was held. The latter school is based essentially on the views of Justus von Liebig. It attributes the fact that plants take up substances from the soil solely to the so-called \" nutrient-need \" of the plant. The one-sided chemical fertiliser theory that thinks of plant needs in terms of nitrogen-phosphates-potassiiun-calcium, originated in this view, andthe theory still dominates orthodox scientic agricultural thinking to-day. But it does Liebig an injustice. He himself expresseddoubt as to whether the \"N-P-K\" theory should be applied to all soils. Deciency symptoms were more apparent in soils poor in humus than in those amply supplied with it. The following quota tion makes one suspect that Liebig was by no means the hardened materialist that his followers make him out to be. He wrote: \"Inorganic forces breed only inorganic substances. Through a higher force at work in living bodies, of which inorganic forces are merely the servants, substances come into being which are endowed with vital qualities and totally different from the crystal.\" And further: \"The cosmic conditions necessary for the existence of plants are the warmth and light of the sun.\" Rudolf Steiner gave the key to these \" higher forces at work in living bodies and to these cosmic conditions.\" He solved Liebig's problem by refusing to stop short at the purely material aspects of plant-life. He went on,with characteristic spiritual courage and a complete lack of bias, to take the next step.And now an interesting situation developed. Devotees of the pmrely materialistic school of thought, who once felt impelled to reject the progressive thinking advanced by Rudolf Steiner, havebeen forced by facts brought to light during research into soil- biology to go at least one step further. Facts recognised as early as 1924-34 in bio-dynamic circles\u2014the significance of soil- life, the earth as a living organism, the role played by humus, the necessity of maintaining humus under all circumstances, and of building it up where it is lacking\u2014all this has become common knowledge. Recognition of biological, organic laws has now beenadded to the earlier realisation of the undeniable dependence of plants upon soil nutrient-substances. It is not too much to say thatthe biological aspect of the bio-dynamic method is now generally accepted; the goal has perhaps even been overshot. But, importantas are the biological factors governing plant inter-relationships, soil structure, biological pest-control, and the progress niade in under standing the importance of humus, the whole question of energy-sources and formative forces\u2014in other words, cosmic aspects of plant-life\u2014^remains unanswered. The biological way of thinkinghas been adopted, but with a materialistic bias, whereas an under standing of the dynamic side, made possible by Rudolf Steiner's pioneering indications, is still largely absent. Since 1924 numerous scientic publications that might be re garded as a rst groping in this direction have appeared. We refer tostudies of growth-regulating factors, the so-called growth-inducers, enzymes, hormones, vitamins, trace elements and bio-catalysts. But this groping remains in the material realm. Science has pro gressed to the point where material effects produced by dilutions as high as 1:1 million, or even 1:100 million, no longer belong to therealm of the fantastic and incredible. They do not meet with the unbelieving smile that greeted rules for applying the bio-dynamic compost preparations, for these\u2014with dilutions ranging from 1:10 to 1:100 million\u2014are quite conceivable at the present stage of scientific thinking. Exploration of the process of photo-synthesis\u2014 i.e., of the building of substance in the cells of living plants\u2014has opened up problems of the influence of energy (of the sun, of light,of warmth and of the moon); in other words, problems of the trans formation of cosmic sources of energy into chemical-material con ditions and energies. In this connection we quote from the book Principles of Agri culture* written in 1952 by W. R. Williams, Member of the Academy of Sciences, USSR: \"The task of agriculture is to transform kinetic solar energy, the energy of light, into the potential energy stored in human food. The light of the sim is the basic raw material of agricultural industry.\" And further: \"Light and * Translated from the Russian by G. V. Jacks, Director of the Com monwealth Bureau of Soil Science (London, 1952). 122 123warmth are the essential conditions for plant life, and consequently also for agriculture. Light is the raw material from which agri cultural products are made, and warmth is the force which drives the machinery\u2014^the green plant The provision of both raw material and energy must be maintained. The dynamic energy of the sun's rays is transformed by green plants into potential energy in the material form of organic matter. Thus our rst concrete task is the continuous creation of organic matter, storing up the potential energy of human life.\" And still further; \"We can divide the fourfundamental factors into two groups, according to their source: light and heat are cosmic factors, water and plant food terrestrialfactors. The former group originates in interplanetary space . . .\" Or again: \"The cosmic factors\u2014flight and heat\u2014act directly on the plant, whereas the terrestrial factors act only through an intermediary (substance).\" We see Aat the author of this work rates knowledge of the inter- working of cosmic and terrestrial factors as the rst objective of agricultural science, while ranking organic substance (humus)second on the list of objectives of agricultural production. This is what was published in 1952, In 1924 Rudolf Steiner pointed out the neeessity of consciously restoring cosmic forces to growth processes by both direct and indirect means, thereby freeing the present con ception of plant nature from a material, purely terrestrial isolation; only through such restoration would it be possible to re-energisethose healthful and constructive forces capable of halting degenera tion. He said to me, \"Spiritual scientic knowledge must have found its way into practical life by the middle of the century if untold damage to the health of man and nature is to be avoided.\" \u00bb \u00ab Our research work began with the attempt to nd reagents to the etheric forces and to discover ways of demonstrating their existence. Suggestions were given which could only later be brought to realisation in the writer's crystallisation method. Then it was our intention to proceed to expose the weak points in the materialistic conception and to refute its ndings by means of its own experimental methods. This meant applying exact analytical methods in experimentation with physical substances, and even developing them to a ner point. We proposed to work quantitatively as well as qualitatively. During my own years at the university, for example, it was my regular practice to lay my proposed course ofstudies for the new term before Rudolf Steiner for guidance in the choice of subjects. On one occasion he urged me to take simultaneously two\u2014no, three\u2014main subjects, chemistry, physicsand botany, each requiring six hours a day. To the objeetion that there were not hours enough in the day for this, he replied simply,\" Oh, you'll manage it somehow.\" Again and again, he steered things in the direction of practical activity and laboratory work, away from the merely theoretical.Suggestions of this kind were constantly in my decades of work which arose from them. They led me not only to work in laboratories, but also to apply the fundamentals of this new outlook to the management of agricultural projects, both in a bio-dynamic and in an economic sense. Dr. Steiner had insisted on my taking courses and attending lectures in political e(\u00bbnomy as well as in science, saying, \" One must work in a businesslike, prot- making way , or it won't come off.\" Economics, commercial history ,industrial science, even mass-psychology and other such subjects were proposed for study, and when the courses were completed. Dr. Steiner always wanted a report on them. On these occasions he not only showed astounding prociency in the various special fields, but\u2014what was more suprising\u2014he seemed quite familiarwith the methods and characteristics of the various profesprs. He wovdd say, for example, \" Professor X is an extremely brilliant man, with wide-ranging ideas, but he is weak in detailed knowledge. Professor Z is a silver-tongued orator of real elegance. You needn't believe everything he says, but you must get a thorough grasp of his method of presentation.\" From these and many other suggestions it was clear what had to be done to promote the bio-dynamic method. There was the big group of practising farmers, whose task it was to carry out themethod in their farming enterprises, to discover the most favomable use of the preparations, to determine what crop rotations build up rather than deplete humus, to develop the best methods of plant and animal breeding. It took years to translate the basic ideas into actual practice. All this had to be tried out in the hard school of experience, until the complete picture of a teachable and leam- able method, which any farmer could protably use, was nally evolved. Problems of soil treatment, crop rotation, manure and compost handling, time-considerations in the proper care and breeding of cattle, fruit-tree management and many other matters could be worked out only in practice through the years. Then there was the problem of coming to grips with agricultural science. Laboratories and eld experiments had to provide facts and observational material. I was now able to prot from the technical and quantitative-chemical education urged upon me by Dr. Steiner. This was the sphere in which the shortcomings and weaknesses of the chemical soil-and-nutrient-theory showed up most clearly, and where to-day\u2014after more than thirty years^\u2014one can see possibilities of building a bridge between recognition of the existence of cosmic forces and exact science. The rst possibility of breaking through the hardened layer of current orthodox opinion came through discoveries that cluster around the concept of the so-called trace elements. Dr. Steiner had pointed out as early as 1924 the existence of these nely dis persed material elements in the atmosphere and elsewhere, and hadstressed the importance of their contribution to healthy plant 124 125development. But it still remained an open question whether theywere absorbed from the soil by roots or from the atmosphere by leaves and other plant organs. In the early thirties, spectrum analysis showed that almost all the trace elements are present in the atmosphere in a proportion of 10\u00abto 10 \u00ae. The fact that trace- elements can be absorbed from the air was established in experi ments with Tillandsia usneodis. It is now common practice in California and Florida to supply zinc and other trace elements, not via the roots, but by spraying the foliage, since leaves absorb these trace elements even more eflSciently . It was found that one-sided mineral fertilising lowers the trace- element content of soil and plants, and\u2014most significantly\u2014^thatto supply trace-elements by no means assures their absorption by plants. The presence (or absence) of zinc in a dilution of 1:100million decides absolutely whether an orange tree will bear healthy fruit. But in the period from 1924\u20141930 the bio-dynamic prepara tions were ridiculed \" because plants cannot possibly be influenced by high dilutions.\"Zinc is singled out for mention here not only because treatment with very high dilutions of this trace element is especially essential for both the health and the yield of many plants, but also because it is an element particularly abundant in mushrooms. A comment by Rudolf Steiner indicates an interesting connection which can be fully understood only in the light of the most recent research. We read on page 107 of the Agricultural Course: \"... Harmful parasites always consort with growths of the mushroom type causing certain plant diseases and doing other still worse forms of damage. . . . One should see to it that meadows are infested with fungi. Then one can have the interesting experience of nding thatwhere there is even a small mushroom-infested meadow near a farm, the fungi, owing to their kinship with the bacteria and other parasites, keep them away from the farm. It is often possible, by infesting meadows in this way , to keep off all sorts of pests.\" Organisms of the fungus type include the so-called fungi imperfecti and a botanical transition-form, the family of actinomy-cetes and streptomycetes, from which certain antibiotic drugs are derived. I have found that these organisms play a very special rdlein humus formation and decay , and that they are abundantly present in the bio-dynamic manure and compost preparations. The preparations also contain an abundance of many of the most im portant trace elements, such as molybdenum, cobalt, zinc, andothers whose importance has been experimentally demonstrated. Now a peculiar situation was found to exist in regard to soils. Analyses of available plant nutrients showed that the same soiltested quite differently at different seasons. Indeed, tests showednot only seasonal but even daily variations. The same soil sample often disclosed periodic variations greater than those found in tests of soils from adjoining elds, one of which was good, the other 126poor. Seasonal arid daily variations are influenced, however, bythe earth's relative position in the planetary system; they are, in other words, of cosmic origin. It has actually been found that the time of day or the season of the year influences the solubility and availability of nutrient substances. Nrunerous phenomena to be observed in the physiology of plants and animals (e.g., glandular secretions, hormones) are subject to such influences. The con centration of oxalic acid in bryophyllmn leaves rises and falls with the time of day with almost clock-like regularity. Although in this and many other test cases the nutrients on which the plants were fed were identical, the increase or decrease in the plant's substantial content varied very markedly in response to varying light-rhythms and cycles. Joachim Schultz, a research worker at the Goetheanum j whose life was most unfortunately cut short, had begun to test Dr.Steiner's important indication that light activity acts with growfli- s^ulating effect in the morning and late memoon nours, wmie atnoon and midnight its influence is p'owtEhmhibitlng. When I inspected Schultz's experiments, I was struck by the fact that plants grown on the same nutrient solution had a wholly different I substantial composition according to the light-rhythms operative. I This was true of nitrogen, for example. Plants exposed to light duringthe morning and evening hours grew strongly under the favourable influence of nitrogen activity, whereas if exposed dming the noon homrs, they declined and showed deciency symptoms. The way wasthus opened for ex^rimental demonstration of the fact that the so-' called \"cosmic\" activity of light, of warmth, of sun forces especially, but of other light-sources also, prevails over the material processes. These cosmic forces regidate the course of material change. When and in what direction this takes place, and the extent to which the total growth and the form of the plant are influenced, all depend upon the cosmic constellation and the origin of the forces concerned.. Recent research in the eld of photosynthesis has produced ndings which can hardly fail to open the eyes even of materialistic observers to such processes. Here, too, Rudolf Steiner is shown to have been a pioneer who paved the way for a new direction of research. It is impossible in an article of this length to report on all the phenomena . that have already been noted, for they would more than ll a book. ! But it is no longer ^ssible to dismiss the influence of cosmic forcesas \"mere superstition\" when the physiological and biochemietd inter-relationships of metabolic functions in soil-life, the rise and fall of sap in the plant, and especially processes in the root-sphere i are taken into consideration. * \u00bb * * In an earlier view of nature, based partly on old mystety- I tradition and partly on instinctive clairvoyance\u2014a. view origiriating in the times of Aristotle and his pupil Theophrastus, and continuing on to the days of Albertus Magnus and the late mediaeval \" doctrine of signatures \"\u2014^it was recognised that relationships exist between 127 OBjcertain cosmic constellations and the various plant species. These constellations are creative moments under whose influence species became differentiated and the various plant forms came into being. When one realises that cosmic rhythms have such a signicant influence on the physiology of metabolism, of glandular functions, of the rise and fall of sap and of sap pressure (turgor), only a small step remains to be taken by conscious future research to the nextre^isation, which will achieve an experimental grasp of these creative constellations. Many of Rudolf Steiner's collaborators have already demonstrated the decisive effects of formative forces in such experiments as the capillary tests on lter paper of L. Kolisko and the plant and crystallisation tests of Pfeiffer, Kriiger, Bessenich, Selawry and others. Rudolf Steiner's suggestions for plant breeding presented a special task. Research in this eld was carried out by the authorand other fellow-workers (Immanuel Vogele, Erika Riese, Martha Kuenzel and Martin Schmidt), either in collaboration or in inde pendent work. Proceeding from the basic concept of creativecosmic constellations, one can assume that the original creative impetus in every species of sub-type slowly exhausts itself and ebbs away. The formative forces of this original impulse is passed on from plant to plant in hereditary descent by means of certain organs such as chromosomes. One-sided quantity-manuring gradually inhibits the activity of the primary forces, and results in a weakening of the plant. Seed quality degenerates. This was the initial problem laid before Rudolf Steiner, and the bio-dynamic movement came into being as an answer to it. The task was to reunite the plant, viewed as a system of forces under the influence of cosmic activities, with nature as a whole. Rudolf Steiner pointed out that many plants which had been\" violated,\" in the sense of having been estranged from their cosmic origin, were already so far gone in degeneration that by the end of\u00ab the century their propagation would be unreliable. Wheat and potatoes were among the plant types mentioned, but other such grains as oats, barley and lucerne belong to the same picture. Wayswere sketched whereby new strains with strong seed-forces could be bred from \"unexhausted\" relatives of the cultivated plants. This work has begun to have success; the species of wheat have already been developed. Martin Schmidt carried on signicant researches, not yet published, to determine the rhythm of seed placement in the ear, and to show in particular the differencebetween food plants and plants ^own from seed. According to Rudolf Steiner, there is a basic difference between the two types, one of which is sown in autumn, nearer to the winter, and the other nearer to the summer. Biochemists will eventually be able to conrm these differences materially in the structure of protein sub stances, amino-acids, phosphorlipoids, enzjme-systems and so on by means of modem cltfomatographic methods.The degeneration of wheat is already an established fact. Even where the soil is good, the protein content has declined; in the case of soft red wheat, protein content has sunk from 13% to 8% in some parts of the United States. Potato growers know how hard it is to produce healthy potatoes free from viruses and insects, not to mention the matter of flavour. Bio-dynamically grown wheat main tains its high protein level. Promising work in potato breeding was unfortunately interrupted by the last war and other disturbances. Pests are one of the most interesting and instructive problems, looked at from the bio-dynamic viewpoint. When the biological balance is upset, degeneration follows; pests and diseases make their appearance. Nature herself liquidates weaklings. Pests are therefore to be regarded as nature's warning that the primary forces have been dissipated and the balance sinned against. According to ofcial estimates, American agriculture pays a yearly bill of ve thousand million dollars in crop losses for disregarding this warn ing, and another seven himdred and fty million dollars on keeping down insect pests. People are beginning to realise that insect poisons fall short of solving the problem, especially since thedestmction of some of the insects succeeds only in producing new, more resistant kinds. It has been established by the most advanced research (Albrecht of Missouri) that one-sided fertilising disturbs the protein-carbohydrates balance in plant cells, to the detriment of proteins and the layer of wax that coats plant leaves, and makes the plants \" tastier \" to insect depredators. It has been a bitter realisa tion that insect poisons merely \"preserve\" a part of moribund nature, but do not halt the general trend towards death. Ex perienced entomologists, who have witnessed the failure of chemical pest-control and the threats to health associated with it, are beginning to speak out and demand biological controls. But according to the ndings of one of the American experimental stations, biological controls are feasible only when no poisons are used and an attempt is made to restore natural balance. In indica tions given in the agricultural course, Rudolf Steiner showed that health and resistance are functions of biological balance, coupled with cosmic factors. This is further evidence of how far in advance of its time was this spiritual-scientic, Goethean way of thou^t. The author is thoroughly conscious of the fact that this exi\u00bbsi- tion touches upon only a small part of the whole range of questions opened up by Rudolf Steiner's new agricultural method. He is alsoaware that other collaborators would have written quite differently, and about different aspects of fe work. These pages should there fore be read in accordance with their intention: as the view from a single window in a house containing many rooms. 128129R U D O L F S T O N E R A S P E R S O N A L TEACHER Maria Roschl-Lehrs T D m e e t a g r e a t p e r s o n a l i t y i n t h e r e l a t i o n s h i p o f p u p i l a n dteacher is a source of strength for life. The invigoration flowing from this source can be used for the fullment of tasks that life brings one. The details of the instruction received are not of a kind that can be reported directly. What can be given here is only a reviewing of one's memory, and a number of impressionswhich can help to bring out with some clarity the picture of the teacher's personality. In several of his published books, Rudolf Steiner gave counsel about the inner development of man. This will be spoken of here as his \" teaching \". But he also instructed some people as his pupils individually. This can be called \"personal guidance\". The dis tinction between \"teaching\" and \"personal guidance\" should be carefully observed.The teaching about the inner Path which a great individuality gives to his age forms part of the history of human culture. It arises from the facts and conditions of evolution in the period in which it is given, and influences this period in the direction of a ^er, higher evolution. It is addressed to the many who are willing to seek, and to make efforts, in this realm, and who are prepared to follow such indications. It is given in a form which takes into account the general, healthy average level of inner strength, and which brings about, when rightly followed, a har monious, positive development of the human being. Since the teaching is addressed to people in general, it can in our time be published in print. For human beings are now develop ing to the point where they can begin to experience, both in themselves and in other people, aspects of man's nature which were not previously grasped, and have remained for the most part unknown.The Romantic writers of the beginning of the XlXth century spoke in this connection of the \" night sides \" of human nature. Several of them gave particular attention to these\u2014^for example, Justinus Kemer, who as a physician took care of the \" Seeress of Prevorst\". But at that time only scattered phenomena of an unusual and often chaotic, pathological kind were\u2014at least publicly\u2014^known. Now an extension of die eld of experience for the human soul into iJie region of the supersensible lies on the general line of development for mankind. We need to understand how such phenomena are related to the condition of man at the present time, and how they can be rightly understood and controlled. Therefore Rudolf Steiner, who had full insight into this realm, published, out of a sense ofresponsibility, explanations and directions for a heathy ulner development. For if these phenomena of the soul's life are notunderstood, they may be regarded as illnesses, or dened as such, even when they are not Dangerous and unhealthy aberrations into mediumistic or spiritualistic practices may occur, which have nothing to do with a healthy development of the human being inthe realm of supersensible experience, as this has been made possible by the teaching of Rudolf Steiner . Everyone is free to notice and read these books by Rudolf Steiner or to neglect them; to skim through them supercially or to recognise their value; to ridicule them or to make active use ofthem. This is the sphere of freedom\u2014a freedom which permits neglect, with all its far-reaching consequences. There is also a question of moral responsibility: whether one is willing to recogmsethe coming into being of the new stage of human development, or believes it one's duty to oppose this for the sake of traditional standards. Looking back over history , one might ask: Why do there con tinually come into being new directions for the inner training ofman? The briefest form of answer would be: because each stage in the evolution of humanity needs a modication of the iimer path, owing to the changes in man's psyche and his physiologicalcondition. Different methods were right for oriental man; different methods again for the ancient Greeks, for the medieval Christians, and for the men of our time. The living connection that man experienced with the divine- spiritual world, as it meets us in the ancient religious and literarydocuments of mankind, and as it lives particularly in the myth^ depended upon early man having a dif ferent condition of body andsoul. This clairvoyance was gradually lost, and had to be lost. It becomes plain to unprejudiced research that man has purchased his hold upon, and mastery of, the material world, which has meant an immense enlargement of his eld of experience through the senses, with a great narrowing of his consciousness in the super sensible. How indeed could a man be active in Ae modem technical and mechanical elds if he experienced material forces as living beings, as did the men of ancient times? In this way man has been deprived of his \"wholeness\". The part of his being which could once unite itself in experience with thereal supersensible world, and draw from it strength and g;mdanro, had to become silent for a long time. But man is the bearer of a spirit, and cannot, in the long run, work and live in conformtywith his real being without the sources of strength that com\u00a9 from the supersensible world which is his origin. The number of those who are aware of this is increasing at the present time, because they feel themselves inwardly broken up by modem civilisation andits demands. And so the cry for the \" wholeness \" of man is heard more and more. It is realised that man has become incompleteand through this hast lost power. Many would like to recover this power, and thus to experience their whole nature once more. Andso lectures and publications point back to old forms of religion and their methods of training, to oriental books and meditative writings \u2014there is a wide choice. In Rudolf Steiner's book. Knowledge of the Higher Worlds and How to Attain It, the way into wholeness which is tted for European and Western man in our time is desmbed. It does not lead to personal power, but to moral puri cation, to a widening of consciousness into spiritual experience, and to the possibility of fully effective service to others, to humanity. This is the \" teaching \" of Rudolf Steiner. * * * * \"Personal guidance\" presupposes that the pupil takes the \"teaching\" fully into account, and therefore follows its principles,which are of general validity. It acquires its individual character through having as basis the knowledge gained by the teacher of the pupil's being and destiny. The pupil's individual past, which hasfomed him as he stands before the teacher , provides the starting- point of his training. And when personal guidance bears fruit, thepupil also recognises sooner or later his teacher's eternal Sign.Full pupilship really begins when this knowledge is attained. A relationship of this kind between teacher and pupil is just as unique as an individual destiny. And since personal guidance isbuilt, from the side of the teacher , on such a basis, it is not possible to pass on directly the counsels and exercises given by the teacher in such a particular case, as if they were valid also for others. For these instructions are based on preconditions which are not applicable to another person\u2014on the special characteristics of the pupil, right into his physiology. They take into account his national origin, and the stage of development he has already reached. Thereis thus a profoimd difference between the \" teaching \" and \" personal guidance\". If therefore one is asked to give a picture of Rudolf Steiner as a ^rsonal guide, this can be done only in individual outlines, which require for their understanding purely personal preliminaries.But I will select here a particular line, which has a quite general bearing on our present-day culture, and is therefore objectively understandable. * * * * Two regions of experience, connected with one another, stand in the foreground; both occupied my attention from very early childhood. First, and the earlier in time, the child's pondering recognition that some human beings are felt to have signicant anddesirable qualities, while others arouse opposite feelings. From ^s gradually developed, in youthful years, the conception of the\"kernel\" of a human being. This kernel was very different in pa^eular people\u2014^with some, weighty and strong; with others,hght and insignicant Some mi^t be quiet and retiring, and 132appear outwardly insignicant, but had a worthy kernel. Others appeared colourful and brilliant, but one exprienced something quite disappointing as their kernel. Later, this kernel was recog-nis^ as the personality , the \" I\", of the other. Similarly, there was from childhood the question why oneshould experience at night in dreams, so much that was beautiful, but so much that was terrifying, too. During the day there were the rich and signicant impressions of the surrounding world, which the child absorbed attentively in every detail. Fine differences in the processes of blossoming and growth in the trees during spring, below in the garden; the behavioin: of the anima^in the courtyard close by; exactly observed symptoms of illness in playmates and people of the neighbourhood; aH this was intensivelyabsorbed and remained clear in the memory as isolated impressions, about which one neither spun theories nor asked other people. Only later, generally after years, such sequences of memory were linked, often suddenly, into clear knowledge, and provided through the childhood memories, which reached unusually far back, some thing like a broader basis for understanding waking life. But dreaming and sleeping, intervening every night in this other experience, remained a great question. There were dreams inwhich the gures of fairy stories, and the human beings of the day , reappeared. But there were also dreams which were not dreams,and remained indelible in the memory of the school-child, clearly outlined, overwhelmingly moving. About this, too, one asked nobody; it remained a question. Thus at an early age the problem of the different levels of consciousness became a pressing one. How (d all this happen? University studies did not give any answer, nor did the culture of my native town, so rich in noble arts. Hence there was nothing for it but to go on observing exactly and studying independently. In this Goethe became my friend and leader. A thorough study of his whole life and work did not indeed provide the knowledge of how sleep and dream come to be, but they brought the rewarding and important insight that dreaming was of quite special signicance for his creative work. From his youth onwards, his poetty sprang from this condition of consciousness. He himself pointed to herich world that man cannot yet consciously grasp. The dre^-like creative conditions which powerfully, ahnost violently, took hold of him during his youth, he learnt to control and to rammand by un'-\"actively contemplative\" (tdtig-nachdenkliches) life. such pheno mena of consciousness; this much my studies showed. They gave to my problem a deepened, signicant background. But my questioning and seeking concerning the origin of sleep and dreamwere not answered in this way, or by studying philosophy and psychology. I found the answer only some years later in the picture of man given by Rudolf Steiner. 133When I then met Rudolf Steiner personally, and he received me into the college of teachers of the rst Waldorf School, he asked me to come to him directly, by word of mouth or by letter, with all questions concerning inner development. In this way personal pupilship began. And without my having touched, in any con versation, on the questions which had occupied me from childhood in the way I have recounted, my training began precisely at the point where these questions had their root. \u00bb \u00ab * \u00bb It belongs to the essence of the inner path, as Rudolf Steiner describes it, that in striving for self-knowledge one should face oneself as an observer. This applies also to the individual line of training. From this arose a particular attentiveness to the method of the guidance given to me, to the progress from conversation to conversation, together with a particular feeling for the way in whichthis guidance was built up. It became evident to me as a living work of art, formed of delicate, steadily increasing clarication and deepening. Every conversation was a step forwards, an enrichment of my inner being. I learnt what delicacy of observation is, and I was endowed with a teaching about life through the discussion of situations and phenomena with which I had to do. A wealth of help, not only for inner endeavour, but also for the understandingof toe demands of external life, resulted from these conversations. A joyful beauty lived in them, and everything was illuminated by a wise goodness. This goodness became for my soul toe living soil for something which is inborn in man, and yet is so seldom aided in its develop- rnent by life: I experienced what truth is. Not as logical con sistency of facts or thoughts and the like. I felt it shine out in myself as a light illumining toe whole human being. No wishremained in the soul but to become translucent in my whole being for toe teacher's gaze. This wish had no personal aim or purpose. I experienced that without this desire to become transparent, I could not have in myself that light which penetrates not only one's own being, but can reveal toe surrounding world with its life and its creatures in their own innermost nature. Its rays fell also on toe teacher, and in its light his being became ever more transparent In this light a condence in oneself became established, which gave toe inner freedom that liberates from the confusion and delusion of conventional opinions. This kind of self-condence is not based on recognition by others, or on one's own valuation of one's personality, but on toe nding of toe bridge to those worlds wMch guide human fate through divine wisdom. It is based on faith in God\u2014something of which one began gradually to realise the true meaning. A special quality of Rudolf Steiner's guidance was toe care with which he left his pupils free. I never felt myself bound by a chain of obligations wmch would have suppressed my own oreativewill. He never gave further directions, except when in my own endeavour and seeking I met with a hindrance, could get no further alone, and asked for help. One's own will to endeavour developed in harmonious agreement concerning toe goal: toe knowledge of toe goal, towards which he helped me, and toe will to toe goal, ^ which answered to it in myself. Thus one experienced Rudolf Steiner as guardian of freedom. These are indications about toe living work of art of his personal guidance; I indeed experienced it immediately as such, but came to recognise its far-reaching signicance for one's development andtoe forming of one's character only at a much maturer age, through further knowledge. Rudolf Steiner was incapable of behaving like a schoolmaster towards another person; rather, he helped toe other to bring his own being to full development and blossoming, in an unconditional, objective way, as toe sun helps on each particular plant and flower. One felt oneself in toe presence of a cosmic power, in the truest sense of toe word\u2014one toat gave help and aidin a gentle, loving way. Through this one was rescued from toe narrowness of an aU-too-personal human attitude, both in toe judgment of oneself and in assessing toe helpfxil positivity of toe teacher, for this was concerned with what is actually great in toe pupil's higher being\u2014something that the pupil himself had not yet attained, but had toe will to make his goal, seeking to achieve his\" wholeness \". These characteristics of Rudolf Steiner remain in one's memory as ideals for one's own endeavour and for toe relationship of human beings to one another. In spite of the stern clarity of his judgments, toe rst thing for Rudolf Steiner was to foster another's destiny, to give helpful, guidance about toe tasks and possibiliti^which were founded in toe other person's innermost being. He did not himself need or use the other person, but led him towards the best toat lay within him, or her. Thus I learned to be a pupil in freedom, constantly helped forward by toe experience of truth and goodness, conveyed to me not in an overwhelming way, but in beauty. If during my studies of Goethe I came to know him as a work of art shaped by life, in Rudolf Steiner I experienced an artist in toe shaping of life itself. That is how he stands in memory, clarifyingand purifying the still unclear, not yet formed substance of toe pupil's destiny.^ ^ T r a n s l a t e d b y A .

If I remember rightly, the inscription had been found on a centuries-old memorialstone in the very year when inflation was at its peak. But were the Germans actually such a pitiable folk in the year 1923? We had flocked to Stuttgart from all directions: there were pupils from Austria and Switzerland, England and Portugal, Denmark and Italy. I am rmly convinced that we are still all at one in realising that at no other time or place could we have experiencedthe richness of the world in the way that was possible during those years, when old conceptions and certainties were tottering, chasmsof distress were yawning ahead, and the breath of the dragon of imiversal fear was poisoning the hearts and minds of men. The seeds of courage for deeds worthy of man were planted in our souls by the new art of education practised in the Waldorf School. How had it all come about? In Breslau I had heard Thomastik, the violin-maker from Vienna, give an account of a course of lectures to teachers delivered by Rudolf Steiner at the Goetheanum. A picture was presented ofhow one-sidedly our modem educational system aims at intellectual knowledge. \" Is it not scandalous that it took a world war to bringhome to a man that he ought to leam how to sew on a button for himself?\" Thomastik said that in the Waldorf School the boys as weU as the girls learn to knit\u2014and I thought longingly of my beloved Samskola in Sweden, where the very greatest importance WM attached to handicraft (slojd). Rilke had come to know about this school whUe on a visit to Ellen Key, and had spoken enthusias tically of if in Germany. But here there was something else as well \u2014'I. realised this from what Thomastik was saying, '^^at could it be? I myself was then a pupil at the Senior Girls' School and every day came home tired and bored, laboriously forcing myself to grap ple with the homework. In the middle of Thomastik's lecture something whispered inside me: \"Away with it all!\" ... I wenthome and told my parents that they had given me the wrong kind of education, that they had forgotten the \"limb-man.\" Not one day longer would I attend the school; later on I should be able bysome other means to take the matriculation examination. First of all I must go into domestic service. My father understood and acquiesced in the decision of his 17- year-old daughter, out of whose sight, until then, broom and iron, duster and latchen-cloth had been kept hidden by three or four servants. As a Grammar School boy in Sweden he himself had once t^own his herbarium, with its ^ied dandelions and grasses, out of the window, and had gone to a shipyard to leam how to forge iron. My mother was tearful, because from the cradle on wards an academic career had been intended for me. But as she had the greatest faith and trust in Friedrich Rittelmeyer, she agreed to my father's proposal that I should go into his household to do domestic work. In the household\u201410 in number\u2014of the first leader of the Christian Community, I was now to nd the opportunity of making up for the hitherto neglected activity of the \"limb-man\" by clean ing vegetables and washing floors. Every Wednesday and Saturdayit was also one of my duties to remove the everyday appurtenances from the dining-cum-living room of this large and hospitable family and tum it into a chapel. I did my duty willingly but not really adequately , and enviously admired the writing and painting books which the children of the house, all of different ages, brought home from the Waldorf School in the Kanonenweg. It had been my intention to enquire on the spot whether the Waldorf School could not come to the rescue at any rate of my youngest sister, so that in her case the proper balance between theactivities of head, heart and hand might be achieved I myself, at my age, would have to rely on self-education. But was I really too old? The rumour came to my ears that one of the girls in the highest class at the Waldorf School was actually engaged to bemarried, and young Count KeyserUngk was said to be very nearly 20. ibis gave me courage. I had really no loftier wish than to be one of the throng of boys and girls whose merry voices flUed the Kanonenweg every day. I had never seen such happiness on the faces of the pupils at any school known tO' me in Austria, Germany and Sweden. They looked like a new race of human beings; it was as though one wanted to sing in chorus with them: With us comes the new age. . . . The day and the hour, the colour of the walls in the room, the shimmer of the light during that fateful conversation with a friend which sealed the resolve to apply for admittance to the Waldorf School, are inscribed forever in my soul. On 18th February, 1923, I went condently up the wide stone staircase to Herr Stockmeyer.\" What do your parents say?\" was his rst question. \" They do not know about it yet.\" \"Then ask them rst. We are not really in tending to accept new pupils for the highest classes after the unfortunate experiences we have had. . . . But go upstairs to Herr Baumann in the song room.\" And so for the rst time I went intothe room from which later on we could see the colours of the sun sets over Stuttgart, while the choir of the highest classes was singing Baumann's songs: Wind, . .* I had already seen Rudolf Steiner on several occasions and had also heard him speak. Before actually setting eyes upon him I had seen his photograph. My father, a Swedish engineer who. like many of his countrymen, had worked for years as a kind of peace maker between Germans and Slavs in Bohemia and Upper Silesia, had returned to Sweden because he felt that the political develop ments in border-regions of this kind precluded that atmosphere of peace in which his children could be educated for true manhood. In my Swedish godfather's library I then saw for the rst time not only Leonardo's \"Head of Christ,\" Michelangelo's \"Creation Goethe on the bookshelf, but also a post card-size photograph which at once made an indelible impression on me. The man in the photograph was Rudolf Steiner. And so from the rst moment onwards he was siurrounded in my mind with pictures speaking of the nearness of the Divine and the greatness ofthe human spirit. Then I had seen him at a Eurhythmy perfor mance in Breslau when he gave the introductory address, and after the performance, when a respectful crowd surrounded his car before it drove oflf. He waved and smiled, and my companion, a girl of my own age, said to me: \" Surely goodness itself speaks out of that smile!\" On the previous day, 31st Januaty, 1922, he had appeared for a moment, with his high fur cap on his head, in the central doorway of Ae Breslau Concert Hall, just before the lecture was due to begin. He looked quietly at the crowded audience waiting in tense expectation, and then disappeared. At that time his name was on everybody's lips. I heard a voice behind me say: \" Everyone who sets store by spiritual things is here to-day.\" In a long black coat, Rudolf Steiner walked quickly to the lecture-desk. It seemed to me that his way of lecturing bore the hallmark of an inviolable probity; there was absolutely nothing suggestive, fanatical or mystical about it, although it was just these elements that might have been expected from him. He was on a three weeks' lecture tour and this was the 19th evening. He gave me the impression of being overstrained, and to begin with he spoke with eyes closed, as if to ward off the curiosity and insistence of the audience. Although I was still in my teens, I had already been to schoolsin three different countries, and in every case what had made the school endurable for me was that there was always one teacher or another whom one could love. However interesting the material, if it was presented by an uncongenial teacher I simply could not assimilate it. What impressed itself upon me this evening was not, , *\"Wmd, thou my friend\u2014long had dark mountains glower'd aroundprimarily , the personality of the speaker, or even the content of hislecture. It was the manner in which he spoke, the tone and the method, the approach to the subject. Because of this completely selfless devotion to his theme, he seemed to me to be the model of what a true teacher should be. And now, a year later, the moment had arrived when he was to decide whether I could be accepted by the Waldorf School as a pupil in Ae real sense. The doubt was not so much on account of my age\u2014now 18\u2014but because it had recently been found necessaryto dismiss one or two pupils from the highest class as incorrigibly disturbing elements, and new experiments of the kind were not regarded with favour. f Herr Baumann took me behind the curtains and put the request to Dr. Steiner. He looked at me for a moment and I saw a memory rise up in him. \"Karin Ruths ... the daughter of Karl Ruths? Yes, why not, why not?\" I was happy that at this moment when destiny was being sealed, he remembered my father whom, as far as I knew, he had seen two years previously in circumstances more tragic than pleasant. But I must rst ask for my father's per mission. This I duly received, and his gentle 'Yes'\u2014he did not like being parted for a long time from one of his daughters- resounds across the years and on beyond his death, just as the' Y es' at the marriage-altar echoes on through the whole of life. The rst day of school was at Eastertime. At the beginning of each school year it was the custom of the teachers at the Free Waldorf School to greet each class individually in the presence of the whole body of pupils assembled in the gymnasium. This time, Rudolf Steiner himself\u2014the teacher of the teachers\u2014was present. T ogether with the others, he went on the platform and addressedthe pupils. In Breslau it had been the objectivity of his lecture that had impressed me; now, together with my schoolfellows, I was seized with a heartfelt enthusiasm such as I had never yet experi enced. I have forgotten the details of what he said; I remember only that he nished his address with the question: \"Do you love your teachers?\" and that I, the newcomer, joined in the 'Yes!',shouted so jubilantly that the walls might have been brought down like the waUs of Jericho. In the very rst lesson I knew that one could really love these teachers and also the subjects they had to teach\u2014what they taught and how they taught. Not a sih^e lesson in the following school year\u2014sad to say , there was only one\u2014cast the slightest ^adowover this rst experience of the character of the school. At that time, when the corridors and classrooms in all other schools were painted grey or brown, leaden yeUow or at most white, a rose-coloured glow shone towards one from the stairways and also from the walls of our own classroom.In the course of this year, Rudolf Steiner's visits to Stuttgart were times of festival. I heard that when the Waldorf School was being spoken of elsewhere, he often referred to it as the \"Free Waldorf School founded by Emil Molt and directed by me\"\u2014 always mentioning, rst, the one who had t^en the initiative, andthen his own share in it At one of the monthly assemblies he spoke to us, his pupils, as follows: \"You see, when I come to theWaldorf School I always feel great happiness\u2014and when someone is happy, ideas come to him. And so to-day a humorous idea came to me. . .\" He then told the story which was included later on in the reading-book compiled by Caroline von Heydebrand, the story of the two children each trying to pick the best bunch of flowers. When they compared their bunches, one of the children had in cluded thistles among the honey-yielding flowers. \" Why thistles?\" asked the other. \" So that the donkeys too shall have something to eat . .\" But reading a story is not the same as hearing it told. It was an unforgettable experience to hear Rudolf Steiner saying Eseln, pro nouncing it as only Austrians can, and to see the children's eyes, how they hung on his every word\u2014^for he had the supremeart of arousing the attention of the youngest and oldest alike. Art? It seemed the most natural thing in the world. He himself had said that he was happy when he came to visit us, and all the children were jubilant. When he went across the courtyard of the school they clustered around him like the berries on a vine. An elder girl, who had only recently become a pupil and was taken to him because of her state of health, was asked by him how she liked the school. \" Oh, very much,\" she said, \" the only thing I don't like is descriptive geometry.\" He was very disappointed, saying that nothing more beautiful than descriptive geometry could possibly be imagined. (One is reminded here of how Rudolf Steiner describes his joy when, as a child, he flrst came into contact with geometry.) It once happened to me that at the beginning of a mathematics lesson I was caUed to the blackboard to demonstrate the home work. I knew I could not, and got up hesitatingly from my place. Imagine my fright when the door opened and Dr. Steiner, our\"School Inspector\", came into the classroom. Like li^tning I saw myself from top to toe\u2014^it was that familiar moment when one wants to sink through the floor. I was conscious of everything, from my clothes to my inmost self, which was now being shown up in all its imperfection and incapacity. Tremblingly I went forward to the blackboard, for there was no drawing back. With his black, broad-rimmed hat still in his hand, Rudolf Steiner sat down in the left-hand comer at the back of the classroom. I made desperate efforts to remember some of the homework and to write and draw on the blackboard. Suddenly the whole ten sion relaxed: it was as though peace itself had come into the room, 140and I was completely calm. Out of this calm came the power to do what was required of me. In later years this occurrence has always seemed to me a basic illustration of the effect of Rudolf Steiner's influence: rst, agonising self-judgment, painful realisation of one's own shortcomings and incapacities; then, balance of soul, inner tranquillity whence springs the power to attempt the utmost possible. Pupils who had particular difculties or irregularities of health were now and again taken to him individually. I remember having heard that he once advised a boy to learn shoemaking. A girl prone to states of depression was to have a blister applied to the pelvic vertebrae every six weeks by Dr. Kolisko, the school doctor. Asked about the reason for this. Dr. Kolisko explained to her: \"You see, a person who easily gets depressed walks about with a bent head and bowed back. A blister like this stimulates the forces for hold ing oneself upright.\" In my family there were several cases of a disease generally regarded as hereditary. As the time was approaching when weshould have to decide in what profession we wanted to pass on the impulses received' in the Waldorf School, this became a vital ques tion for me. Would not a tendency to such a disease prove a bur den rather than a help to the Movement? The teacher to whom I went for advice sent me to Rudolf Steiner. The conversation with him took place in the teachers' room at the Waldorf School.' Dr. Steiner received me standing up, scrutinizingly, seriously. . . My smile of greeting was not returned. This worked like a shock\u2014 in smiling one goes out of oneself, smiling has a uniting effect. I felt thrown back upon myself, upon my own person. He wanted to see my handwriting.\" I ran back to the classroom, happy that just to-day I happened to have my tidiest exercise-book there. Dr.Steiner put it aside, almost with irritation: \"This writing is not really characteristic of you, it is one you have acquired.\" In fact it was not my usual writing; I had been making strenuous efforts at the time. \"What ought I to do?\" I asked him, after having spoken of my plans and apprehensions.\"You ought not to give a single thought to heredity,\" he replied with emphasis.\" I am not afraid of it, I am only reckoning with it.\" \"You should not reckon with it either,\" he rejoined with equal emphasis. \" What you need is great variety \"\u2014he made a sweeping gesture. \"Become a Waldorf School teacher! When you are standing in front of a class, there you have the variety you need.\"Now he was smiling, and I went away as if the wings of Mercury were on my feet. Why was it that everything Rudolf Steiner said carried such weight? There is a pleasing story which seems to me to illustrate this. It was told us by Dr. Walter Johannes Stein, our history teacher, during a lesson on cmrent affairs. Shortly after the rst Ml.world war. he had taken the \"Appeal to the German People and to the civilized World\" to certain leading men in Austria, including Hermann Bahr, the writer. \"From Steiner Rudi?\" asked Bahr, even before he had read it. \"Whatever comes from him I will sign.\" And when he had read it, he said: \" I would have signed that even if it had not come from Steiner Rudi.\" One felt that objective truth itself spoke through this personal allusion. The end of the nal term was drawing near. As the Waldorf School was not yet ve years old, nobody in our class had been able to go through it from the start, and all of us would have pre ferred to be beginning now, rather than leaving. Then one day in the late afternoon, when, reluctantly as always, we were obliged to tear ourselves away from our classroom, an idea came to one of us \u2014think it was Valdo Bossi, the Italian boy. \" Could not all of us together ask to have a talk with Dr. Steiner before we have to leave here?\" This talk was promised to us. The sun was shining into the teachers' room and they all sat around us along the walls, while we were told to tdce our places at the conference table, at the head of which, with Frau Dr. Wegman beside him, sat Rudolf Steiner. There he was\u2014a leader of man kind, the most universal spirit of our age, nay of whole epochs\u2014 and he took us, a few boys and girls leaving school, so seriously that he listened to each individually. But to begin with he addressed us all together. He said that when life brought us face to face with crucial decisions, we should feel the spirit of the Waldorf School behind us, whispering the right resolutions into our ears. \"The intercourse with your schooellows will be of the very greatest signicance for you: think back to it again and again.\" We were then asked to say what we wanted to be in life. He said he could well imagine that many of us would like to be Waldorf School teachers\u2014but naturally not all at this particular school, because it was to be hoped that the teachers we loved would not so soon be dead. (He pointed to them sitting along the walls.) The ' best' scholar among us, our most capable mathematician at any rate, actually spoke of his readiness to become a' teacher. But he was advised to train for a. commercial career. \" Go to Eng land and America\u2014^see how things are done there\u2014and then come back and do them here as they ought to be done.\" Another wanted to be an architect. For him Rudolf Steiner proposed a technical training; he should try to carry right into technology the artistic element he was seeking. Two of us who wanted to go in directly for teaching were advised to study physics, chemistry, philosophy and psychology. To a classmate who was thinking about becoming a kindergarten teacher. Dr. Steiner said that the one and only thing that mattered there was that the children should love her\u2014a kindergarten teacher might sometimes be quite stupid inteUectuaJy . . . . Looking back afterwards, it seems to me that while entering intoom youthful problems in the most loving way, Rudolf Steiner wanted at the same time to keep us from losing our heads, in order, rst and foremost, to prevent spiritual arrogance. The following may be a still better illustration of this. The eldest of us, who was already engaged to be married, had originally wanted to study medicine, but we were all so thoroughly convinced of the entirely new impulse in Waldorf School education that to enter Ae traditional life of a university seemed to us a retrograde step. \"After the Waldorf School I simply could notendure an ordinary medical training\u2014it would kill me,\" the girl said with emphasis. \" But.why?\" rejoined Rudolf Steiner. pointing in a friendly way to Frau Dr. Wegman at his side. \" She has stood up to it very well. . .\" Hel continued: \"In your position \"\u2014mean ing that of a girl shortly to be married\u2014\"it would be a good thing to learn Curative Eurhythmy, because that is not a full-time pro fession.\" (This was before the days when it became one.) Then he turned to us who were racking our brains over our lofty spiritual tasks' for the future. \"Above all, dear girls, themost dreadful thing for the Waldorf School would be if it produced a lot of inveterate old maids\u2014it is to be jioped that you too want to marry.\" Almost with indignation I cried out: \"But, Herr Doctor, mar riage is not a profession!\"\"In what sense not a profession? It is a generally recognised one.\"\" But men marry and have a profession as well.\" \" Y es, but I was speaking of this quite special case.\" T o a girl whose desire was to become a nursing sister , he said:\" That is a profession which demands great sacrice. The patients in the Arlesheim Clinic sometimes do not get better at once because an interesting lecture which the nurses want to hear is being given up at the Goetheanum. . . A good nurse must have somethingabout W that does the patient good the moment she comes in at the door.\" A classmate who wanted to devote herself to artistic work was advised to go to Domach. It was also mentioned at this point that the Goetheanum could not yet take the place of a ' IBgh School in the sense in which the Waldorf School now took the place of an ordinary school. But in this conversation it was clear to me thatDr. Steiner regarded the inauguration of a High School in the real sense as desirable. When he then made the suggestion that we sho^d come again to Stuttgart in the autumn in order to exchange the mst expenences in our careers, it seemed to me that the present gathOTng was like a veritably new beginning. I thought I understood Dr. Sterner to CB-lOmean that we should come back once a year, in our holidays, for an Extension Course under the guidance of our former teachers. In September, 1924, we had the second and last conference with Rudolf Steiner. He listened attentively to what we had to say\u2014 remember especially that he seemed to be delighted when a pupil spoke about his work in a factory, describing how entirely thecharacter of a department where woodwork was going on differed from another where iron was being manipulated. He went into this point and Aen began to talk to us about the Threehold Social Order. \"The idea of the Threefold Social Order is not dead,\" he said, \" only at present it has not been understood. And I hope that understanding of it will grow from the circle of Waldorf School pupils.\" That is more or less what I remember.When another of us spoke of his wish to go to South America, in order to work out certain scientic matters on the spot, he was told: Whatever is being studied, whether it be plants or minerals, one should not to rely on collections in museums or in some articial setting, but to explore them in their actual locality and natural environment We were also invited to the Youth Course on education which was planned for November, but could not be given. On 28th Sep tember, Rudolf Steiner gave his last address, and the future autumn gatherings of former Waldorf School pupils, which we owe to his incentive, were destined to take place without him. During the rst days of April, 1925, a few of us met in the Schreinerei at Domach. Without any previous arrangement we encountered one another outside the studio where the earthly sheath of our teacher wasi lying. We were allowed to go in. The breath of life in death stirred through the stillness of the room where the greatest spirit of our epoch lay at the foot of the work wrought byhis own hands\u2014^the statue of the Representative of Humanity. When we left the Waldorf School he had given us words of guidance for our lives. We listened to them standing up and after wards received them from him in writing. When we were together for the last time he enjoined us to medidate on them assiduously\u2014 we should soon become aware of their effect.

O.THE BIRTH OF CURATIVE EDUCATION Albrecht Strohschein A f t e r t h e r s t w o r l d W a r , a s a s t u d e n t i n J e n a , I g o t t o k n o wsome of the workers at a large Children's Home. They wanted to hear about Anthroposophy and they came along one after another, until naUy there were eight One day I was mvited by those in charge of the Home to go and see them, and was asked if what these young people brought forward at conferences was anthroposophical. (It was in connection with the education of handicapped chUdren.) Since these workers could not be ^ed educationally experienced or anthroposophically teamed, I felt 1must give them some support I was successful m this, for mt Siegfried Pickert and then Franz Loffler became teachers m fteHome They were not appreciably older than the others, but they had been connected with Anthroposophy for a longer time.Now the great Christmas Foundation Meeting in Domach was at hand; our seven or eight wanted to go and we set about ndingthe jouraey-money . Germany had just changed from the paper- billions to the Rentenmark, and we were all as poor as beggars. Pickert and Loffler were now working with backward children, and it grieved them that their endeavours to gain knowledge of man and the universe had to be made apart from the practice of thete profession. On the other hand, in their daily life with the handi capped children, they were constantly confronted wth decisions which they had to reach merely on the basis of feeling, and n^from any penetrating pedagogical knowledge. That was the cleft w h i c h m y f r i e n d s w e r e e x p e r i e n c i n g . , _ ^ I myself, through an inner experience at the the age of tiroen, had been led early to seek for the knowledge of what life actually is.

At this. Rudolf Steiner looked me up and down and said with an emphasis Aat quite unmistakably applied to the money-question, but only in this one case and peurticular connection;\" You need not take that into consideration.\" I sent in my name at nwn to Emil Molt, the benevolent director of the Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory. He had founded the Waldorf School and so I thought he would view this new foundation with understanding. But when he had heard all about it, he exclaimed, horried, \" I beg you, let us start nothing new; we have cares enough already with the Waldorf School!\" The disappoint ment of the moment made me lose control of what I said, and it is thanks solely to the greatness of Herr Molt that he overlooked it and later expressly showed me friendship. \"Herr Molt,\" I said,\" I have not come to seek advice; I asked you for money,\" and got up to take my leave. \" Wait a moment,\" he said, \" I will give you 1,000 marks.\" \"As a loan?\" I asked, still extremely cool. \"Non- returnable,\" he replied. That was the rst money for the budding curative education. In the afternoon a few more thousands were acquired, and the proposal of an agreement for a lease went to my friends by expressletter. Two days later came a telegram: \"Please return. Make agreement\" The agreement was made, and by pooling resources we had the rent for several months. We did the most necessary repairs at Lauenstein ourselves, and now my purchase of thirtyold army beds at an auction, two years previously , with the idea of starting a students' hostel, turned out to be money well spent. We sent for thei beds\u2014they filled a wagon as they could not be folded up\u2014^painted them, and bought the cheapest mattresses to be had.We begged the rest of the essential pieces of furniture, and received touching help from elderly friends. In May of the same year, 1924, we were able to move in and receive the rst children. I had kept on my student room in the town, and while Pickert and LoflBer carried out the organising work at Lauenstein, I undertook the necessary joximeys for additional furniture and money, above all the journeys to Domach or Stuttgart to see Dr. Steiner, whose advice we continually needed. Thus, among other things, we felt we must get out a prospectus and we thought we could simply take over our predecessor's description ofthe Home at Lauenstein; he was a doctor who had wanted to foimd a \"Home for Pathological and Epileptic Children.\" \"No,\" objected Dr. Steiner, \" it must be clear from the title what is being done there.\" I looked at him inquiringly, and he said; \"Curative and Educational Institute for Children in need of Care-of-the-Soul^' iseelenpflegebedurftig*).I still looked at him inquiringly, not fully understanding the new expression, but I took out my notebook and he dictated to meword for word; \"'Care-of-the-Soul,' large letters, 'in need of,' * Tlie English Homes express this as \" children in need of special care.\"small letters . . .\"and added, \"We must choose a name that does not stamp the children immediately .\" Now I slowly realised for the rsttime that 'care of the soul' was something belonging to all education, which everyone might be called upon to practise; there was there fore nothing in it to separate our children from others. And with this, our future centres of curative education had received their name. * * * During oe of these visits to the Domach Studio, Rudolf Steiner said of his own accord, \"I will come to you.\" and, after we had talked it over, \"but there is no need for anyone to know. I wUl give a Course for you.\" His visit to Lauenstein began towards 12 o'clock in the evening of 17 June, 1924. Dr. Steiner came to Jena in the express train from Breslau, where he had given the Agriculture Course; we three met him on the platform. Following his instruction that \"no one need know about it\", we had told none of the numerous Jena members of his arrival, however bad we felt about it. His instruction obviously meant that on this visit he wished to speak only with those who were connected with our work. V ery few people got out; he arrived with two members of the Domach Vorstand, Dr. Elizabeth Vreede and Dr. Wachsmuth, walked slowly along the platform and was the rst through the barrier. He held out his ticket to the collector\u2014but the man looked at this traveller with such astonishment that he made no attempt to take the ticket. I stood directly behind and saw tiie fascination. Dr. Steiner waited a moment, handed him the ticket and went on. We drove by taxi to the old Bear Hotel, ''Zum Baren\", where Luther had lived, and in passing through Ae h^ Rudolf Steiner looked at the oil paintings on the walls. When the reception clerk asked for registration in the visitom' book, he t(^ his fountain pen and entered; \" Dr. Rudolf Steiner, wnter, Giinther Wachsmuth, travelling companion; Dr. Elizabeth Vreede. At 8 o'clock the next morning I went to fetch him; he was already sitting at breakfast with Dr . V reede and Dr . W achsmuth. He said he had a ne room and did I know who had stayed there? Alas, I had to say \"No,\" although I had looked at the roona and had been assured it was the best in the hotel. I had missed me little silver plate fastened to tiie head of tte bed saymg that Bismarck had slept there on such and such a date. I felt ash^edand took the lesson to heart, although it had been no more than asimple allusion. A few minutes later Rudolf Steiner stood u^,b e i n g a l w a y s v e r y p u n c t u a l , a n d a s t h e f o m o f l i s g o t i n t o A e t a \u00bb ,h e a s k e d t o g o r s t t o t h e p o s t - o f c e , a s h e w i s h e d t o s e n d a t e l eg r a m .

We then drove on to Lauenstein Our friends and fellow-workers were already st^dmg at the door , together with our rst ve chUton and a few others who hadalso to be presented. We then led Dr . Sterner through the wholehouse, and as we came to the ceUar-stairs a woman pressed past us in the narrow space. I was immediately asked about her. I replied that she was a cleaning-woman, and received for answer,\"You must see that you remain in contact with her.\" (The re markable thing in the destiny of this woman were two children, aged thirteen and six years, both albinos of a peculiar kind. Inthe gleam of their delicate light hair they looked like two fairy-tale princesses. They were to be presented to Rudolf Steiner, a fact we had not yet mentioned to him.) We stood a little while in the courtyard, looked at the building from outside and then at the picture of the landscape in the light of summer. Tlus landscape is so beautiful that even the Jena guide book notes; \"One should not miss seeing a sunrise up at Lauen- stein.\" Rudolf Steiner at this moment bent towards me and asked quietly, \"Tell me, how have you actually done this?\" I scarcelymade reply\u2014myself did not know exactly how it had been done. Soon after Ae arrival we wanted to get to work and therefore led the guests into the reception room, where, since we had to be very economical, the chairs that stood round the table were cheap ones. For the day's festival we had hired a comfortable armchair, and had had it brought up from the town with no other thought than that Dr. Steiner would use it. We had not reckoned, however, with his exemplary courtesy. He offered it at once to Dr. Vreede, the leader of the Mathematical-Astronomical Section at the Goetheanum, and after she in her energetic way had declared, \" Herr Doktor, the armchair is for you,\" he invited the next lady. She accepted; he sat down on one of the simple chairs and we had had our lesson. Werner Pache, who had come as a fellow-worker soon after Lauenstein had been taken over, now brought in the children one after the other. He remained for the discussions and could record the most important things in shorthand, which was of great im portance to us. The rst boy, a quite feeble-minded and veryresdess child, rst ran round the table and then went up to Dr. Steiner and leant condently against him. He became for the moment quite quiet and friendly, so that his true ne nature broke through. Rudolf Steiner interested himself in his sense-perceptions,and it was established that. he could see very little at a distance. When we remarked on the'Boj^s bad teeth, Rudolf Steiner said that the nger-nails, too, were weak and soft. \" Has nothing struck you about the mother?\" he asked. We knew neither father nor mother, having been in touch with the parents only through corre spondence. \"It is really an individual destiny, it has not much todo with the family,\" he explained. \" It is a remarkable karmic case. The astral body is over-mature. Something is working in from the former incarnation. He spent only a short time between death and a new birth, so that he still has something of the astral body of the previous incarnation. He still has remarkable dreams at night;this will be shown by his saying strange tihings in broken sentenceson waking up. He might see snakes writhing out\u2014if he has already seen ordinary snakes. It is a bad astral body, located mainly here at the back of the head \" (Rudolf Steiner laid his hand with intense interest on the stiff black hair). He went on, \" One could deal with that by administering the opposite astrality; itcould be done with the help of seaweed. Seaweeds draw in ^e astral forces of the smxounding air; mushrooms still more. TOt tere is no need to start at once witJi the strongest Parasitic plants draw in astralitv strongly. Through seaweed injections healthy astrality is drawn in. the opposite of what is in the body. There is b^asttahty there.\" He ten gave the therapy, consisting of a pa-weed preparation and belladonna, together with the exact potencies. The case of the second child gave us experience of Rudolf Steiner's educational attitude. This was a pupil who had gone normally through elementary school, but had moral difculties,told lies, swaggered boastfully and was inclined to steal. As the boy was brought in and introduced, he went forward and said, withself-assurance and emphasis, \"Good morning, Herr Doktor.\" Now one had an immediate feeling that the way Dr. Steiner handled this boy was both educative and healing. For instance, he asked,\"Can you do sums and write?\" \"Yes, naturally,\" came reply. name?\" \"Karl.\" \"Then please write down:' I am from Berlin, my father is named KarlDr. Steiner explained to us that there was a great weakness of the ego which caused the moral failings. Even to-day I doubt if any of us would have come to this diagnosis from the boy's outwardself-assertion. Once, for instance, he had come downstairs wearing the shoes belonging to one of our fellow-workers. And as the latter took him to task the boy retorted, with self-condent ease: \"Y ou're not thinking, perhaps, that these are your shoes?\" For his educa tional therapy we were told, among other things, that he ought to mend the shoes of everybody in the house, in order to improve his relation to social life. Then, however, indications were given for medical treatment We were astonished: rn/^ral f^ftlmguencies to be treated medically? Y es, certainly; the sugar formation in the blood must oe regmated; one must work\" on tne warmth it is there that hinan soul-qualities lintoid. When all the children had been considered, we fellow-workers received a word of advice. Dr. Steiner pointed out that at leastone of us ought to have a teacher's certificate-\u2014he foresaw conmg necessities. Now all three, Pickert, Loer and I, had bwn activefor a certain time in educational work, yet none of us m toe courpof his studies had thought of taking the teachers prti^te. Infact, we had none of us meant to go m for ci^tive eduction.L o f fl e r h a d o r i g i n a l l y b e e n a H u n g a r i a n o f fl r e r . D e ^ y h a d c o nn e c t e d u s w i t h ^ p r o b l e m s o f m e n t a U y b a c k w a r d c M d r e n a n d w eh a d s i m p l y s o u g h t f o r a n t h r o p o s o p U c a l l i g h t m a s p h e r e w ^ r e w es a w o t h e r s h e l p l e s s . T h e a d v i c e r e l a t i n g t o t o e t e a c h e r s c e r t i c a t ewas followed, and it very soon transpired how necessary this was if our organisation was to get concessions. At about the same time perplexed parents had brought patho logical children individually to Rudolf Steiner at Dornach, and inher energetic way of tackling things Dr . Wegman had taken a small house for them, \"Die Holle\". The rst backward children had appeared at the Stuttgart Waldorf School, and Rudolf Steiner had en^ted them to the Austrian teacher. Dr. Karl Schubert. It wasevident that the hour for putting curative education on a new basis had struck before we were even clear about our own aims in life, and before die general public guessed that these children for whom Rjidolf Steiner found the phrase seelenpeflsebedurftig^ were to\" become an ever more pressmg problem over the whole civilised earth. It was time for the midday meal; I sat next to Dr. Steiner andsaid Grace, and he joined in the Amen with his warm deep voice. It seemed like a benediction, a gracious protection for this table,at which ate together the messenger of the spirit to our age, pathological children, members of the Domach Vorstand and wenovices of curative education. Conversation began, and we found that Dr. Steiner knew Jena better than w\u00a9 did: he drew our atten tion to the phenomenon of the tower in which one can see the stars in daytime. But he also related jests and amusing stories, among them the accident that had just happened at Koberwitz. He hadwritten something at night, having already retired, and a spot of ink had fallen on the pillow . Countess Keyserlin^, however , the hostess, was fortunately not at all conventional, and when he had apologised the next morning she said joyfully that this pillowwould be preserved. Dr. Wachsmuth leant forward: it was to be hoped that this ink-blot would not be treated like the one at the Wartburg, which was attributed to Luther and was stained again from time to time for the benet of visitors. Walking through the garden. Dr. Steiner told us that every childmust leam to know all the trees and flowers growing there, and we were by now able to grasp that this was not only a matter of awakening an interest in natural science. Knowledge of the sur rounding world is decisively important for the life after death.From an exact knowledge of the surrounding world one can form a knowledge of the inner world for the next life. It was gradually coming to be evening, although the sun still stood high in its summer course. Dr. Steiner had to think of (^htihi^g his journey. He said he would much like to stop ashort time in Weimar. Hearing this wish, I suggested ordering a ^ to drive him the twenty-odd kilometres. Instead of replying,he called to Dr. Wachsmuth, \" Wachsmuth, can we afford a taxi to Weimar? Have we enough money left?\" We were relieved when the question was answered in the afrmative, for what Dr. Steiner a^mplished in those weeks passed all imagination. W e felt di^y ,thou^ none of us younger ones realised it consciously , that some 152day all this might be too much for the strength of an earthly body. The 18th of June was at an end. If we celebrate this date in many Children's Homes as the Foundation Day of our curativeeducation work, it is also because this one day which we were able to spend with Rudolf Steiner became for us in every sense a proto type for the whole future life with the children. If we were toldlater that a special tone prevailed in our Homes, it was the tone that he had given; it was our endeavour to acquire it and carry it on. It became clear to me during this visit that from then on I must not merely arrange external affairs in this eld, but must myself take an active part in the coming work of curative education. * * * * Two days later we fomr travelled to Domach for the Curative Education Course. We had to wait a few days, however, for Rudolf Steiner had found an immense amount of work awaiting his return. He had said that this Course would be conned to those who were directly concerned. From Stuttgart came Dr. Schubert and Dr. Kolisko, the curative educationalist and the doctor of the Waldorf School; from the teachers. Dr. Ernst Lehrs; from the Priesthood of the Christian Community, Licentiate Emil Bock; while Frau Lili Kolisko, founder of the \"Goetheanum Research Institute\" at Stuttgart, came for a few days. Together with the members of the Domach Vorstand, the doctors of the Arlesham clinic\u2014among whom was Dr. Julia Bort, who later devoted herself entirely to curative education work-;-we were alto- gefer about twenty persons. Rudolf Steiner wished that no stenographer should be called in, but if one of us could write shorthand, he had nothing against the lectures being taken down. Three of those present did their best to produce a transcipt We sat with great expectations in the hall of fe Schreinerei; only the front rows of chairs were occupied, and Rudolf Steiner spoke from a desk down below to this unusually small audience.What exists as lecture-notes can never convey the impression. How he developed the incamation process, normal or irregular, manifesting in various diseases; how he presented the children who were in Dornach for treatment, read out the history of their maladies, and then, starting from the notes of the doctore, illu minated the various symptoms with reference to karma; or how he occasionally expounded certain educational measures, such ^ the release from insistent ideas\u2014these were impressions that cannot be reproduced. \"A complete catechism for incipient curative edu^-tionalists is contained in these 12 lectures \" w^ said later by Dr.Karl Konig, who came to us after the death of . Another friend pointed out that undoubtedly Rudolf Sterner gave the Curative Education Course with such pleasure and satis faction. and entered so warmly into the spirit of the young people who wanted to be active in this eld, because he himself after his 153university studies had been occupied as a private teacher in this very eld. Dr. Steiner once said that this work had at that time offered him the sole possibility of a livelihood and saved him from one-sidedness. He wrote in his Autobiography of how destiny had assigned a special task to him in the pedagogical eld.As tutor in a family where there were four boys, he had to take three of them through to elementary level and then coach them for a secondary school; the fourth boy , who was about ten years old, was entrusted entirely to his care. This was the family's problem child; he was considered to be so abnormal that it wasdoubtful if he could be educated. \"His thinking was slow and dull. Even the shghtest mental exertion produced headache, lowermg of vitahty , pallor and a state of mind that caused anxiety .After I had come to know the child, I formed the opinion that thesort of education required by such a bodily and mental organism must be one that would awaken the sleeping faculties. ... I had to nd access to a soul which was, as it were, in a sleeping stateand must gradually be enabled to gain mastery over the bodily manifestations. In a certain sense one had rst to draw the soul into the body. I was thoroughly convinced that the boy actually had great mental capacities, though they were then hidden. ... This educational task became for me a source from which I myself learnt very much. Through the method of teaching which I had to employ there was laid open to my view the association between theelement of soul and spirit in man and the bodily element. In this way I went through my own real course of study in physiology and psychology. I became aware that education and instruction mustbecome an art that has its foundation in a real knowledge of man.\" We know that this pupil of Rudolf Steiner was led on to the Lower Sixth, that he was then so advanced as to need no further special guidance, that he passed the university entrance examina tion, took his medical degree, and fell as a doctor in the rst World War. Thus in his own rst task in life Rudolf Steiner set before us the model of what curative education can and will accomphsh. He himself provided this living example of the ideal goal of future curative education. In the Curative Education Course, three-and- a-half decades later, concrete instructions for reaching this goal were given. Our expectations were fullled beyond measure. New and benecent knowledge was imparted to us; immense enthusiasm for the work was instilled into our souls, and the factthat after o^y a few years a number of new Homes could arise was due entirely to all that Rudolf Steiner bestowed on us. Nevertheless, these days of the Course were at the same time parting from him. When we celebrated the rst anniversary ofthe founding of Lauenstein, he was no longer on earth. But work m anthroposophical curative education has since developed in very many countries from the seeds sown at that time. Translated by M.C.T H E L A S T Y E A R S G o e n t h e r W a c h s m u t h T h e s e e d s o f f a r - r e a c h i n g e v e n t s w e r e s o w n w i t h t h e s e t t i n g u pof the research laboratory at the Goetheanum in Domach in the summer of 1921. The arising of such institutions from the impulses of the Anthroposophical Movement never came about because on external grounds it was decided to found an institution in order to carry out certain tasks or experiments, or for any other external reason. It resulted directly from the meetings of persons who in the course of life were led by destiny, and by their own free decision, to work for Spiritual Science in a particular eld. I may be permitted to say that this research laboratory in Domach arose at that time through my contact and friendship with Ehrenfried Pfeiffer. Brought together in a united work by destiny and by freedom, in the same place and with the same interests and objectives, it was inevitable that we were soon searching for premises where we could carry out experiments to test and bring torealisation what was in our thoughts. T o think of those days calls up amusing memories, for the laboratory started in a primitive cellar which had just oneadvantage\u2014gas and running water\u2014but in other respects reminded one of the formless void of Genesis. Rudolf Steiner had agreed to our request to use this space in the basement of the Glashaus, where on the rst floor the glass for the windows of the Goetheanum was engraved, and there we made the most primitive preparations for a laboratory by borrowing a few tables and chairs and procurmg some indispensable glass vessels, retorts, Bunsen biurners, and so on. Our research was aimed at obtaining insight into rhythm and the life-forces, and I remember very clearly a large T orricelli barometer as one of the rst instruments. It was so cumbersome that it soon proved unusable for measuring air pressure, but its vacuum and its quicksilver were very handy for other experiments.I n o r d e r t o g i v e s o m e i d e a o f t h e b o u n d l e s s p r o b l e m s c c ^ f r o n t i n g this elementary groping, let me relate how Ehrenfried Keiffer and I, with a thirst for knowledge and some primitive work behmd us,went to Dr . Steiner and asked him how the life-force, Ae formative forces\u2014in short what he caUed the life-ether-could be won fromnature or in some way introduced into an experiment. I do notknow whether he took our very high-flung question quite senouslyo r w i t h a g o o d p e r c e n t a g e o f k i n d l y a m u s e m e n t - b u t M t e r a ^questions of beginners invariably reach out fost for the stars andthen, afterwards, for something more attainable. At dl events he replied that this was quite a simple matter: all we had to do, forexample, was to get a fly into a vacuum.\" Armed with this indicationfor an experiment, which in the joy and excitement of prospective achievement we understood more or less correctly, we clattered down to our cellar. Catching a fly and putting it into a vacuum was soon done, but then for both of us the crucial question arose\u2014 \"What next?\" Perhaps we really had the life-force there within the vacuum; but what we lacked was the possibility of establishing this fact, of testing or conrming, assessing or putting it into practical application. This trifling rst experiment, in itself perhaps to be taken humorously, nevertheless influenced us decisively, for we nowrealised that our prime need was for a re-agent, a test, something to indicate whether, where and how these forces are present, grow stronger or weaker, and the like. In the framework of this chapter it is not possible to describe the many labyrinthine ways we were obliged to take at the beginning in order to reach the goal, or to mention the countless other, even more concrete indications and stimuli given us untiringly by Rudolf Steiner during the following years, or to record the successes and failures, the lines of thoughtand experiments involved in the further development of this work. Nevertheless it can be afrmed to-day that at many decisive points the aim was achieved, as is shown by numerous publications and their success in many different countries. Here I will mention particularly the elds of application which became apparent to us as time went on. We realised above all that two basic foundations must be established for further research work: rst, a systematised knowledge of the teaching concerning the etheric formative forces, and then a practical testing of experimental arrangements which, by producing reactions to the phenomena of life and the underlyingaction of the formative forces, could make the workings of these forces evident, their rhythms and form-building functions per ceptible, and even reflect their normal and abnormal, healthy and uiiealthy, components. After a discussion with Rudolf Steiner at that time, I began to attempt a systematic exposition of the teaching of the formative forces, on the basis of his indications, by drafting the book. The Etheric Formative Forces in the Cosmos, Earth and Man: A Way of Research into the Living. This went forward under Rudolf Steiner's kindly guidance. Through the founding of the biological research laboratory,active investigation and experimentation had been going on since 1921 in connection with the etheric formative forces, plant cultiva tion, and the study of the delicate reactions that can occur betwee living organisms and substances in solution and in course of crystal lising, Rudolf Steiner participated in all this work with constantadvice and help, encouraging, correcting, indicating directions tobe followed. Together with fellow-workers, I had also arranged a discussion evening on questions of natural science as an extension of the practical work. A small circle of us met every week in the old \"Baubureau\", as the room was called, usually in the presence of Rudolf Steiner himself, who helped us by answering our ques tions. We sat in a semi-circle round a blackboard on the wall, presented our problems, difculties, experiences and ideas, and inthese free and spontaneous conversations received from him corrections and impulses for our further work. In this primitive little wooden room, many important results of spiritual investigation were communicated by Dr . Steiner duringour lively discussions. The principles of a science of formative forces, systematic experiments in the domains of chemistry , physics, geology and botany , and also general problems of cosmogony\u2014allthese subjects were discussed and claried. T o give a concrete example, on one occasion we came to speak of the very rst mani festation of forms of movement in the cosmos, and in this connection I asked Rudolf Steiner how the original lenmiscate-movement, so often referred to by him, was to be explained. Thereupon he spoke in a most graphic way about the primal beginnings of the cosmos, the so-called \"Saturn condition\", and described how the rst movement in the cosmos arose from the rotatory balancing of huge bodies of coldness and heat, how the whole cosmic system then began to move around yet another axis and how the lemmscate-movement developed through the combination of such movements of the cosmic system, both inwardly and around different axw. These expositions were accompanied by lively gestures of the hands or sketches on the blackboard, and helped us to gam gradually deeper insight into the fundamental laws of cosmic evolution.Those Tuesday evenings, with their vigorous and fertle con versations, remain unforgettable, and have been rich endowments for our paths of life and for practical activities in the laboratoryand in agriculture. In spite of his overwhelming burden ot work, Rudolf Steiner devoted a great deal of time to me; with everyreadiness to help he indicated literature for prehmnary study , made suggestions about the ordering and grouping of the matenal, sTve me courage, energy and substance for the writing of my pro-f e c t e d b o o k .

Hence we now went to ask him how these indications and experiments could be turned to practical use in agriculture, and it was then, for the rst time, that he gave us the impulse to obtain preparations from the animal and plant kingdoms. These preparations were to be exposed to the rhythms of the cosmic and earthly forces in summer and winter, in such a way that their life- promoting energies would be concentrated and enhanced, and then,in a state of extremely ne dilution, but having a powerful dynamic effect, could be applied benecially in practical agriculture. Measures of this kind have since been tested so extensively and with such unmistakable success that a few details only need be mentioned here. I still have a vivid memory how staggered we were when Rudolf Steiner advised us to procure cow-horns, ll them with certain substances, bury them somewhere near by and leave them to winter under the soil. After our rst astonishment had subsided, we naturally began to ask many practical questions\u2014 for example, whether when the horns to be buried had been lled, they should be covered at the top with linen, wax or something of the kind, how long the wintering period should be, how deeply the horns should be buried, and so forth. Rudolf Steiner immediately gave denite answers to all these questions, describing what was to be done and what avoided. With regard to the latter, I remember asking whether the animal and plant preparations should havecertain metallic supplements added to them, whereupon Rudolf Steiner gave a highly instructive talk about the harnffulness of certain chemical products used in modern methods of manuring and the elimination of pests. In answer, for example, to a question about the use of quicksilver, he said that its injurious influences would affect not only immediate nourishment but also subsequent generations, and must therefore be avoided under all circumstances.highest and noblest expression\u2014which depends on electricity jmd magnetism; that is, on forces and mechanical devices utterly aliento the delicate life-processes operating in human speech. In a conversation which Dr. von Dechend and I had with Rudolf fteiner on this subject, we asked him whether it would not be possible to nd a more delicate form of reaction to the spiritual and physical formative forces contained in speech, and after brief reflection he said; \" You must work with the sensitive flame.\" In this and in later conversations he gave us deep insight into the unique position occupied by the element of warmth in the sphere of transition between the psychical and physical process in nature. He spoke of the delicate interweaving of inner, psycho- spiritual processes with the warmth-processes in the human body , the relation between consciousness and temperature in the life- processes, and the formative action of the speech-organs on the airoutbreathed and warmed through by man when he speaks. He then recalled the discovery of Tyndall, who had observed the delicate changes caused in open gas flames by noises, musical notes and words in the same room, and he advised us to concentrate our thought and research in this direction. Extensive series of experiments in the physical laboratory , which had been set up inaddition to the laboratory for biological research in Dornach, arose from these indications given by Rudolf Steiner, and in the hands of Paul Eugen Schiller they led to valuable results. So, as in the realm of the life-forces, the new knowledge opened up by Rudolf Steiner has made fruitful the work of a wide circle of students in the study also of substance and energy , and in the domain of physics and technology. , ... Rudolf Steiner had promised to give me a sketch of his own for the title-page pf my book. The Etheric Formative Forces. This had been somewhat delayed owing to the mass of other work, and I did not venture to ask about it once more. Then one night on a railway journey\u2014these journeys were often made by night becauseof the scanty time available\u2014there suddenly came a knock on the door of my sleeper just as I was dropping off. Rudolf Sterner looked through the door and handed me a sheet of paper on whichwas the nished sketch in colours for my title-page. In spite of ^ the strain upon him, he had found time to complete it, even whilet r a v e l l i n g b y n i g h t .

It was the time when radio had just developed out of wireless telegraphy , and radio instruments (which had formerly been used for special pur poses only and were still very primitive in comparison with thoseof to-day) were beginning to nd their way into private homes, hereby exercising a far-reaching influence on everyday life. I hadin my house one such prirnitive apparatus with interchangeable gadgets\u2014^young people of to-day will hardly be able to picture anything of the kind\u2014and when I asked Rudolf Steiner whether I ^ght make one for him, he raised no objection. But we sparedhis studio from this infliction.

(Anthroposophical Publishing Company.) VP 160brance when, looking back, one realises what a devastating strain upon his physical health he bore during these years in order to prepare the way for the decisions to be taken and to help people to shoulder spiritual and earthly responsibilities. In the year 1923, during the many journeys in Europe, he still had the strength for the indescribable pressure imposed by all the external anangements and procedures, the lectures, conferences, discussions, and so forth. Thbse of us who accompanied him, who were with him every day, often had cause to fear that the excessive strain of this year would show itself in early symptoms of impaired health. Inthe following year the strength for all these activities had to be drawn from the bodily reserves, and the unexampled energy of one who was now 63 years of age had to be wrested from actual physical illness. Yet even then he continued these lecture-tours\u2014 indeed, there were not fewer, but more of them. During those journeys of 1923, with his untiring joy in initiative, his open-hearte^ess and the imceasing work both by day and night, he set before us aU the example of a man who, while bearing the heaviest burdens himself, lightens those of others. It would be an entirely misleading picture to imagine that at this time, when Rudolf Steiner was inaugurating all the new development out of the esoteric core of the Movement, he wouldhave tolerated in his environment any note of solemn importance in outer behaviour. How cheerful, open and happy he was on those unforgettable night journeys, at meals and during even ing conversations in the hotels of the great cities of Europe. When, for instance, in November, 1923, we were sitting together one evening in the stately hotel, \"Oude Doelen\" at The Hague, hetold us many delightful and amusing anecdotes from his eventful hfe, and how heartily he could laugh when we gave unadorned accounts of our crazy battle with the water supplies in our rooms the previous night. I still remember a gentleman who followedhim steadily dining a walk at that time with an expression of funereal profundity , and how Rudolf Steiner suddenly tmmed and said with a frien^y smile: \" What a face to go about with aU the time!\" He wanted to have around him happy, free, gay human beings, who were serious at the proper moment but also cheerfuland life-loving, and he often quoted with amupment the words of an Italian Member, Princess d'Antuni, who in her original way of talking spoke indignantly of people who always go about with\" a face reaching down to the stomach!\" These things are mentioned only in order to give some little examples of the balance of seriousness and merriment that was always present in the environment of this great man. Although there were never enough hours in the day for meetingthe innumerable demands upon him, Rudolf Steiner had an extra ordinary capacity for getting through an enormous amount of workwith speed and concentration. When I took him his lettem in the morning, he had generally already received a number of visitors or was writing an article, or he was carving at the great wooden statue which had been set there in his studio, or he wm modelling, or painting, or writing, or he was engaged in discussion. Y et in themidst of these other tasks he was at once ready to concentrate on his correspondence; he went straight into it and gave his comments and instructions quickly and clearly. For anyone who had had previous opportunities of making reports to the chief of a bigorganisation, it was a particular joy to experience his method ofworking\u2014^the uniquely harmonious way in which he combined a grasp of great matters with care for the smallest details, and a kindly human understanding with unambiguous precision in giving directions for the work. Many people who have studied the life of Goethe have perhaps found it strange that this prince of poets shoidd have troubled himself, as a Minister, with Ae minutiaB of administration, including mining, river control, road-building, uniforms for recruits, and various even more specialised matters affecting his department In Rudolf Steiner this interest in every person and every detail could be observed in fullest measure. He devoted himseff equallyto spiritual principles and to the most specialised questions that came up in the daily round. He created the model for the new Goetheanum, and at the same time concerned himself with the design of the crockery for the Domach canteen. At one momenthe would give someone the most far-ranging advice for spiritual work and then, when the caller was leaving, would warn him not to eo'out in the hot sun without a hat. He looked on every humanbe^E as a whole to such an extent that nothing about the person, inward or outward, great or small, right down to external traits oftehaviouf, escaped his interest. This gift for noticing everything,hLause it was never used pedanticaUy , but always with generosity .S n e s s a n d a r e a d i n e s s t o h e l p , s t r o n g l y s t i m u l a t e d e v e r y o n eM O u n d h i m t o l o o k a t t h e t h i n g s o f e v e r y d a y l i f e w i t h w i d e - a w a k e , affectionate attentiveness.

He showed me the house where he had lived, stopped before another building and gazed for a long time in silence at the windows of the rst floor. Then he said that someone whom he greatly respected had lived there, and he spoke with evident inner emotion of his experiences and vicissitudes during that time. He took me also to the cafe where he had so often had stimulating discussions with artists and Goethe enthusiasts. He paused here and there before a house or at a street-crossing and told me wonderful anecdotes about striking personalities of the 'eighties and 'nineties. During this day in Weimar I felt in him a mood of fullment, sustained by the work of the preceding days, and also of retrospect, conjured up by the Weimar atmosphere. Exactly thirty-ve years had passed since he had come here from Vienna to examine the Goethe Archives\u2014a visit which led to the fateful seven years of his work at Weimar on Goethe's scientic writings. The experiences and stages of those years came back to him most vividly while we walked through thefamiliar places, after thirty-ve years of his earthly work had been accomplished. Something else happened during this visit to Weimar which may be mentioned here, for it bears on his relation not only to Goethe but also to the works of Schiller. While walking through the town he stopped suddenly in front of a hoarding and pointed to a notice announcing the performance of a play by Schiller in the Weimar Theatre on that very day. Since a little while before I had foolishly made a not very enthusiastic remark about some of Schiller's dramas, he now said, \"We must really see this.\" It happened to be a not very distinguished performance for the Weimar girls' boarding school, and so in the theatre\u2014believe we were the only men present\u2014^there came about the curious pictoe of the striking gure of Rudolf Steiner in a black suit in the midst of a sea of young girls in white, who in accordance with educational custom were being made acquainted with Schiller's work. In spite of the somewhat inferior quality of the production, he leant over several times and said to me encouragingly, \"There are re^y many excellent passages in this!\" Two years before, on his advice,I had read Deinhardt's Contributions towards the Appreciation of Schiller's 'Letters on the ASsthetic Education of Man'; now, through this visit to the theatre, he gave me the impulse to come to terms again with Schiller's writings as a whole, in spite of having had my * For a detailed account of this visit, see the chapter by Albrecht Strohsehein, The Birth of Curative Education.taste for them ruined at school. This was a characteristic exampleof the way in which Rudolf Steiner kindly but effectively corrected inadequate and one-sided judgments on the part of his pupils. After this moving and eventful visit to Weimar, we went on to Stuttgart. Late in Sie evening, directly after our arrival, RudolfSteiner had a session with the teachers at the Waldorf School. Ashis companion, I had to take part, and this night session has remained vivid in my memory, for after aU die strenuous activitiK of recfent weeks\u2014conferences, journeys, continual discussions, visits to towns and institutions\u2014I was naturally rather weary, and yet m Rudolf Steiner there was no sign of weariness, although he had gone through incomparably more than I had, and he was in his sixty-third year. I had to do my utmost to keep my eyes opei^but he, in spite of the illness already seriously affecting him, showed such wakefulness and energy that no one could have guessed at his past exertions. He conducted the session with the most vital intensity and concentration. As on so many previous occasions, questions with regard to the curriculum, the spiritual and practicalfoundations of the school, were thoroughly discussed, and he not only gave advice and help in cases of special difculty brought upby the teachers, but also fundamental suggestions for the further development of the pedagogical work. Often during this period it happened that when the night session was over , after many hours, he would call immediately for the car , and in the same night we covered the 150 miles from Stuttgart toDornach. Dr . Steiner had the capacity to relax and fall asleep for a short time while travelling in the car, although the roads then were far from good. When we reached Dornach in the grey of dawn, he was able immediately to go to work, beginning the strenuous ro^dnf the day . as full of tasks as the days at Dornach always were.

The sacricial ame consumed him during the months that remained until his return into the spiritual world. His sufferings kept hw physical body tied to a sick-bed from September, 1924,until his death on March 30, 1925. And even throughout this time of suffering the sacricial ame gave light and warmth. Where his workroom was, there Rudolf Steiner stayed during the months when he could no longer go out among people. He never returned to his dwelling-house, but remained until his death in his studio on the Dornach hill, in the simple lofty room where he had worked for decades and had given coimsel and help to many thousands. His bed was at the foot of the Christ statue onwMch he had been carving as long as he could. Now it had to be quieter in this workroom. He could speak directly with only a few persons; his voice became weaker , his hearing a tax on his physical forces. The countenance had become thiimer. Because of his suffering, the form of the noble head was even more plasticallyevident His eyes spoke of pain, but they were kinder and more brilliant than ever. His lofty spiritual powers created in the stillness and concentration those gifts which from now until the end were bestowed on human beings through the written word. Upon entering the studio during these weeks and months, one gener^y found Rudolf Steiner resting half-erect on his bed, readingor writing. He continued to work without interruption. Almost every day during this time he asked me to bring him his correspondence at the usual hour of eleven o'clock; he had the letters read to him, dictated answers and instructions, or gave directions for repliesto all parts of the world. For the stream of questions and of requests for advice from all quarters never ended. If, in order to protect him, I showed him as little as possible, his questions drew into the discussion what had been withheld; for even in this time of apparent external separation he shared most intensely in the lifeof the Society, of the friends, of his students. Every week Albert Steffen received for the weekly journal. Das Goetheanum, an instalment of his autobiography , Mein Lebensgang, painstakingly written in bed with his own hand. During conversations in the studio ttere came to light constantly new glimpses into the nature of signicant individualities, into the tasks of mankind, and into contemporary events. Many things connected with the work, and especially the personal care and treatment of Rudolf Steiner, layin the hands of Dr. Ita Wegman, in whose advice and friendly assistance he had the utmost condence. During these months Rudolf Steiner addressed himself week byweek to the whole body of his students in a letter called To the Members, published in tihe News-Sheet Here he was leading themmore deeply and fully into the inner essence of the new age of Michael. These weekly letters were a concentrated epitome of what he had been bringing home to the consciousness of modem man during the long years of his activity as spiritual teacher; and at the same time they gave practical help and guidance for making further progress with courage and independence along these paths. Each letter ended with a concise \"Leading Thought\" (Leitsatz), making it possible for the student to unite himself through con-. centration and meditation with the spiritual substance of the knowledge given, and thus gradually to make it ever more his own. Besides this creative work, carried on day by day from his sick-bed, Rudolf Steiner continued as always to do an extraordinary amount of reading, keeping himself continuously abreast of new publications in science, art, history, and all other elds of work. Since he could no longer visit the bookshops and the dealers in antiquarian rarities, I was given the difcult job of regul^ly selecting and buying books which might be of interest to Kim. This was an exacting but richly rewarding task, for it was really hard to guess what he already knew, what might or might not interest him, what he would consider important or unimportant. Every few days, accordingly , I visited the bookshops in Basle, andoften in other towns, looking for books which might be what he would care to read. And then, whenever I came to his bedside with a great pile of books, it was always a time of suspense as he thoughtfully took, one book after another , looked at the title andthe name of the author , tumed a few pages, and made his choice.The books that he wished to keep and read he stacked on the right ciHe of the bed, and the others on the left. I was proud, naturally , when most of the books lay nally on the right; but I had to go atS n c T f S S i o f o t h e r s i f t h e h e a p o n t h e l e f t w a s t h e l a r g e r .

I cannot be present in person, but I shall be altogether present in spirit; for my heart is lled with admiring recognition of Steffen's life-work, and with warmest spiritual joy that we can call him oiur own.\" In this December, 1924, a building work still had to be made secure for the future: the construction of the second Goetheanum. Already the scaffolding, the foundation, and the walls of the great edice, following the model made by Rudolf Steiner, were rising on Domach hill; and repeatedly he caUed on those working with him in this spiritual movement to become fully conscious of ^e signicance of the Goetheanum and to labour energetically for itsrealisation. Thus, in a letter dated December 30, he wrote the following words as a reminder of the need for steadfastness: \"For a year I carried about with me in my head the idea for the new Goetheanum. The transformation of this idea out of the medium of wood, used for the rst Goetheanum, into the artistically upyielding medium of concrete was not easy. Then, at the begin ning of this year, I began to work on shaping the model. . . . For many years, in my anthroposophical writings and lectures, I have emphasised that Amthroposophy is not only a theoretical conception of the world, but from its nature gives rise to a special style of art. And, since that is so, a building for Anthroposophy must grow out of Anthroposophy itself. ... I beg you to believe that this results from an iron necessity.\" This creative fullment of what was known to be right and necessary according to spiritual laws\u2014to produce out of Anthro posophy itself the building where science, art and religion were tocome together in a new unity based upon the Spirit\u2014had from the beginning indwelt his creative purpose. He had called upon human beings in the spirit of Michael, tiie Time-Spirit, to be true to this task, to cany further the work which he had placed in the stream of evolution by establishing it in space and time. He now again summoned all those responsible to be consciously active in this spirit, so as to assure for him a working place in the future. As he drew his last breath, he himself closed his eyes; but this lled the room with the experience, not of an end, but of a sublime spiritual action. The forward-striding ^e of the Christ statue, pointing into the expanses of the universe, which he himself had created and at whose feet he now lay, spoke for the eyes of those left behind on the earth of what was here taking place for the ^irit of a great human being who had dedicated his life to theahnun^ation of the CMst. Even in dying, Rudolf Steiner bestowedupon humanity the supreme gift of consolation: the certitude thatdeath is a wiking entry into worlds of spiritual life and deed. What Rudolf Steiner gave to humanity in thw earthly life was not only a teaching that can be accepted or rejected; not only a work that can be developed or destroyed. T eachings- and works have always been subject to the destiny prepared for them by their contemporaries. Rudolf Steiner achieved in the course of his lifethe deed of receiving out of spiritual worlds, and incbiporating in the earthly sphere, the spiritual Being, Anthrdposophia. Such a Spirit-Being now dwelling in the earthly sphere cmmot be overcome by opposing powers through the fact that one or other of its formsof expression on earth is destroyed; it does not forfeit its ejdstence because a bhnd decade will not look at it;' it does not die even though a part of earthly humanity is not ready to accept iti or betrays or destroys its place of work and its dwelling. For it is ofa supersensible nature, and so rebuilds for itself constantly its earthly body. From Rudolf Sleiners Erdenleben und Wirken, Work of Rudolf Steiner . (Whither Books, New Y ork, 1955.) Theabove parts of it have been newly translated for the present volume.RUDOLF STEINER IN HOLLAND F. W . Z e y l m a i n s y a n E m m i c h o y e n A l t h o u g h I h a d a l r e a d y h e a r d t h e n a m e o f R u d o l f S t e i n e ronce or twice, it took a chain of events to bring me into closer contact with him and with Anthroposophy. This came about in the following way. From my school days onwards I was always deeply interested in modem painting; wMe still at a Grammar School I often con ducted my classmates through art galleries and was an ardent champion of Cezanne, van Gogh and Gauguin. It was the colours themselves that interested me primarily, and the new message that was trying to express itself through them. In 1916 this led to my making the acquaintance of the painter Jacoba van Heemskerck,who together with Franz Marc, Kokoschka and Kandinsky, among others, belonged to the \"Sturm\" Movement^; and in the great Exhibition at The Hague I got to know not only her paintings but also her friend Maria Tak van Poortvliet, who later on had all her estates in Walcheren and North Brabant cultivated according to the biological-dynamic principles of agriculture indicated by Rudolf Steiner. These two ladies gave me a number of books on Anthroposophy, every one of which I read. At that time the general view I held was that in the course of the centuries a few personalities of real signicance have appeared in the world. The Buddha and other outstanding gures may be reckoned among them, and now, cer tainly, Rudolf Steiner as well\u2014^that is what I thought to myself.All of them are there to reveal aspects of the \" eternal truth \". But it was far from my mind to think that I should ever have anything to do with one of these personalities in particular. In the years 1917 and 1918, while still a medical student, I was a frequent guest of the two friends on Walcheren and we had many discussions about modem painting, above all about the new use of colours apart from objects. What effect do colours make upon the h u m a n s o u l ? We c a r r i e d o u t . t e s t s w i t h s c h o o l - c h i l d r e n a n d I investigated how the pulse reacted to different colour-impressions,and other things of the same kind. When the Wc Id War was over, summer visitors came to Wal cheren from Germany, among them acquaintances of Jacoba van Heemskerck: Professor Spalteholtz, the author of a well-known text-book on anatomy, and his wife. Spalteholtz was of opinion that the most favourable conditions for colour-experiments of this kind would be found in Leipzig, in Professor Wundt's laboratories there. So in June, 1920, I went to Leipzig. In the mornings I Better known in this country as Expressionism.worked in Professor Flechsig's neurological clinic and in the after noons carried out tests in die Wundt Laboratory. When I had time I was always able to go to the musical evenings held in the house of the Spalteholtz family in the Mozartstrasse, at which many members of the \"Thomaner\" Choir ^ were often present Marie Tak had asked me to convey greetings from her to the leader of the anthroposophical group in Leipzig, and this I duly did. When I told this lady that I was in Leipzig for the purpose of Tpaking colour-tests, she enquired whether I would care to attend the course on the theory of colours then being given by Willy Stokar, a young Swiss who was studying in Leipzig. I went to his course, but thought that everything he put forward was funda mentally unsoimd, and sad to relate I made things so difcult forhim that one day he said to me in despair that if I went on like this I should ruin the whole course. He was quite right. So I went to the Library of the University, borrowed the volumes of Goethe's writings on Natural Science and began with Rudolf Steiner's Introduction. It was as though rays of light suddenly fell iti showers troni thfe sky , penetrating right through me, when I Rudolf Steiner's sentence: \"It foUows that 'the world , which confronts senses, is a sum-total of percepts in continual meta- ^ n v m a t e r i a l s u b s t r a t u m . \" T h i s s i n g l e s e n t e n c e kft me speUbound. It gripped me so deeply that as I walked eve^ dav from the Brockhausstrasse through the Park, watching the colours displayed by nature, it was constanfly before me; a whole world arose from colour as though from a living being. From the autumn onwards I had many valuable talks with WUly Stokar . And when I heard that a course of lectures onmedicine had been given by Rudolf Steiner-untd then I had noSea that anything of the kind took place-and that ProfessorR Hmer who held the Chair of Dental Surgery m Leipzig, and a few other members of the AnthroposopMcal Society , were pro-r S s i n e t o s t u d y t h i s c o u r s e , I w e n t t o t h e l e a d e r o f t h e G r o u p a n dETher that I wished to join the Society . \"Why?\" she asked. shorn like to participate in this work/' \"That isnS^out of the question.

My relation to Anthro- of St. Thomas in Leipzig.to meet Rudolf Steiner. This was the decisive event. It came about in the following way. On December 17, in the evening, I was sitting in the Schreinerei with my ancee, who was studying Eurhythmy in Domach. Happy at being together again, we were waiting for Rudolf Steiner's lectiure. Outside it was bitterly cold; Domach lay covered in snow. Suddenly the blue curtain by the side of the stage lifted, and Rudolf . Steiner went to the lecmre-desk. At that moment I had the direct I experience of recognition. The impression was so strong that a whole series of pictiures simultaneously arose before me, pointing indeterminately to earlier situations\u2014as if I were seeing him as ^ my teacher thiough ages of time. It was the most memorable experience I have ever had in all my life. For some time I sat as though carried away and did not realise until later that his lecture had already begun. It was the rst of the three lectures sub sequently published under the title; \"The Bridge between the SpirituaUty of the Cosmos and Physical Man.\" These lectures werementioned by Rudolf Steiner himself later on, when some young doctors asked him what he would recommend for preparatory study.\"^en I came to myself again and saw Rudolf Steiner standing at the lecture-desk, I had the strange feeling that for the rst time I was lookihg at a Man! It is not at all easy to describe this impression. I had met many well-known and famous people, among them scholars and noted artists, and had always moved in circles where a great deal was going on\u2014^it had by no means been a humdrum existence. But now I realised: tihis is what Man is meant to be! I began to question myself: What is the explanation of it? You have encountered many human beings\u2014^what is it that is so signicant here? I said to myself rst of all that it was his whole bearing, the bearing of one who is like a tree that grows freely between ea^ and sky. This impression was connected not only with his straight, erect gure, but above all with the poise of the head\u2014^it seemed to hover between heaven and eartL The swond feeling was profoundly moving: from this beautiful, power ful voice came forth words which lived on even after they had been spoken. And thirdly, there were the thoughts. I was obliged to confess to myself that I could not always understand them, but I realised that they were not there merely to be under stood intellectually, but they had another, quite different signicance as weU. Listening to professors, what always mattered was whether one understood everything they said. What mattered here was not whether I actually understood\u2014it was something different. T o-day I could speak of \" ideas\", of \" seed-bearing impulses\" and the like, but at that time I could not. I knew only that different impulses were at work here. When the lecture was over, my anc^ said that she would now introduce me to Rudolf Steiner, for he liked this to be done; hewanted to meet young people. I had not thought of anything of the kind, but if it was the custom\u2014well and good. I went to the front with her and was introduced. Rudolf Steiner said: \" I havebeen expecting you here for a long time.\" I thought he meant that I had already been in Domach for a long time. \"But, Herr Doktor , I arrived only late this afternoon.\" He smiled merrily: \" That is not at all what I mean.\" Having now been introduced, I was amaousto ask certain questions arising from my colour-experiment^ in Leipzig, and I asked if I might be aUowed to have a talk with lumsometime. \"Please come to my studio to-morrow at 3 o'clock, he said. The next day I came pimctually to the anteroom of the studio,where a lady was carving wood. She asked tne in a not v^ cordial way what I wanted. \"I have an appointment with Dr. Steiner.\" \" Herr Doktor is not receiving visitors to-day. But please, he told me to come.\" \"No, he is seeing nobody to-day .This was really going too far . \"Will you please be good to tell him that I am here.\" Before there was time for ano&errefusal, the door opened and a Dutch \"f:\"Come in, Herr Doktor is expecting you. So ^ went into tte studio where Dr . Steiner was sitting by a ercely bummg stove.A n e m p t y c h a i r w a s s t a n d i n g a s c l o s e t o t h e s t o v e a s h i s .

You should really not have dis covered it at all, considering the way in which you experiment. For you see\"\u2014^he took writing-pad and pencil\u2014\"it is like this. The spectrum with the seven colours is only one part of the whole spectrum, the part that is visible in the solar spectrum. To understand the whole spectrum one must draw a circle, and then here are the seven colours of the solar spectrum and on the other side the ve j peach-blossom colours. You ought really to have taken your startfrom these twelve.\" Then he said; \" One sees these seven colours ^ because there the astral body swims, as it were, in the colours. But the peach-blossom colour is so subtle and ethereal that it hardly appears at all in external nature; there the *1' is living in the etheric; peach-blossom is actually the colour of the etheric.\" He explained all this quite quietly, tore ott tJie sneet and put it on my knee. He had drawn a rough circle and had indicated the seven colours by letters on the one side, and on the other side the peach-blossom colours. I sat there as if spellbound. It was almost impossible to believe that anyone could speak in this way about colours, for here were the answers to all the questions which I could not formulate properly, but which had lived within me subconsciously for the lastsix mon^. Suddenly, quite spontaneously. Dr. Steiner said: \" Y ou are a doctor, aren't you? What the doctors nowadavs do not ,know, but really ou^t to understand, is the law of reversal ^ (VmstmyunsV He made the moment of puUine off a glove which turns it inside out, so that what was formerly inside, directed towards a centre, is now outside, directed toward the periphery.\" Only when that principle is understood can the human organs be understood in their relation to the universe. This applies especially to the spinal cord and the brain. . . . Goethe surmised it but did not fully understand it.\" He gave certain other examples of organ-metamorphoses, and I j stood up to go, noticing only at this moment that I had been sitting i the whole time with my back to the Christ statue. According to ( the standards of art previously acquired, I did not really think the statue beautiful, but for all that it gripped me, and he saw what I was feeling. \" Yes, that is how the eyes of my spirit saw the Christ in Palestine,\" he said. I stood still for a time while he waited in silence. Then he continued: \"But it is very difcult to show everything that would really be necessary.\" He pointed to therobe. \"If it could be truly portrayed it should be nothing but flowing love.\" He took up the chisel and harder lying there.\"I have had to nd a technique of my own, like this . . . one 174must always take care that the left hand keeps turning, while the hammer is held by the right hand.\" He gave a few knocks with the hammer while I stood there speechless, and then we said good bye. Only later on did it dawn upon me that he was trying to convey to me certain laws of the etheric forces and movements with which a doctor ought to be conversant. During this conversation I had felt aware, to my surprise, ofthe greatest inner freedom I have ever known in the presence of ahuman being. Just picture it: one was in the presence of Rudolf Steiner, the great Initiate, who could see through and through one\u2014 and one would have expected to feel great embarrassment. To my astonishment it was exactly the opposite. I felt freer than ever before, as though caught up into another world where only essentials count, where what is usually considered essential lapses into insignicance. This gave a wonderful feeling of happiness and freedom. The fact that because we were sitting side by side and not facing one another, he was not looking at me all the time, strengthened the feeling of freedom. He was mostly looking in front of bitn and only turned quite suddenly at crucial moments; it was then that the whole sufike power of the eyes was revealed. There were moments when without giving the slightest impression of inattentiveness, he was not listening while I was trying to speak about something or other, but was obviously listening to something else in my soul. * * * * At Easter, 1921, when I went to Domach again, the Goetheanum with blossoms till around it revealed to me more clearly than three - months earlier that its forms had been shaped according to the laws of plant-life, the laws of the living; it seemed to me to be a living being with which from then onwards I felt umted, and I tried to understand how such a great building could produce such an organic, living effect. Wbien I had set eyes on it the rst time, I had merely felt aware of some very unusual effect without being able to dene if; now it was an actual experience. The meaning of the forms in their metamorphoses dawned upon me; I miderstood why pillars\u2014^which no longer fulfil any real purpose in modemarchitecture\u2014^were standing here, and I felt them as the ego-for<\u00bb within these metamorphosing forms. The light streaming frough the coloured glass windows harmonised in a most wonderful way with nature in Spring. It was also very impressive to hear Rudolf Steiner speaking in the great auditorium of the Goetheanum. This was the rst time I had heard him here, for at Christmas he had spoken m the Schreinerei, the temporary wooden structme where work m con nection with the Goetheanum was earned out. It was as if his voice could resound to the full only in the great auditonum. IBs words remained there, and lived on. In one of fe lectures-^hehad spoken of it in the second medical course which was bemg 175 CB-12given during the same period, but this time it was in the presence of a public audience\u2014he showed how Natural Science must develop into Spiritual Science, and that to practise magic in any form whatsoever was not permissible. In parenthesis he cried: \" Oh, but it would be possible!\" He stood there seeming suddenly to have grown gigantic, like a magician, with arms outstretched. It was a deeply moving moment, because one realised what strict, undeviat- ing principles he had prescribed for the course his life was to take. This second course for doctors, like the iSrst, was built up entirely on the basis of questions. It was given in the Glashaus, and one or two people came to the rst lecture a few minutes late. After a remark by Rudolf Steiner on the virtue of punctuality, nobody failed to arrive exactly on time. The contents of thelectures entailed hard struggle. Would one ever be capable of correlating what was said with the knowledge and habits of thoughts acquired from seven or eight years of medical studies? On the other hand, evety sentence strengthened the feeling that a door was opening into a hitherto unknown world. , At that time I also had conversations with Rudolf Steiner about patients, partly from my own practice, for in the meantime I had taken a post as medical superintendent in a department of a mental hospital near Rotterdam. My questions were inspired by the hopethat from now onwards one would be able to cure every sufferer. But in discussing specic cases, Rudolf Steiner explained to me that the trouble might originate in destiny and that nothing could really be achieved; nevertheless in every case I was given adviceabout medicaments. This astonished me, for the attitude that one tries to cure in spite of the fact that nothing can really be achieved is unknown in orthodox medicine. In November, 1921, Rudolf Steiner made a long tour through Holland, speaking in The Hague on the Threefold Social Order and on education; he emphasised in public the need for a World &hool Union for the promotion of freedom in the sphere of educa tion. It pained him greatly that a professor at the T echnical School, who would have been capable of taking up this idea, did not do so. It could have become a splendid demonstration of free spiritual life over the whole free world, something that could have remained neutral, independent of political happenings. At Whitsun, 1922, at The Hague, Rudolf Steiner gave a series of very impressive academic lectures on Anthroposophy and Science. I had many opportunities of speaking with him, mostly about medical questions. At that time he wanted the doctors to bring out a medical vademecum. a handbook entering right into practical measures; with him, deepest esotericism and concrete action were always in balance. So it was, too, when on one occasion he saidto me ttat if the marketing of Biodoron\u2014^the Weleda medicament for migraine\u2014were cleverly done, the Goetheanum could be nanced from that source alone. In connection with the vademecum.one of us asked what was the latest date when it ought to appear. \"The latest date? June, 1921!\" he rejoined. (It was already May, 1922, when we wrote!) During this Spring I had discussed with a friend the possibility of founding a clinic. I now asked Dr. Steiner for his views, saying at the same time that I felt I was really too young and lacked sufcient knowledge of Anthroposophy. He consoled me: \"That you are young is of no account, for every day you become thatmuch older. Nor does it matter that you still know little of Anthroposophy, for every day you will understand more.\" Then he became very serious and recommended me to go to Dr. Wegman,\" for she has the true courage for healing.\" In November, 1922, he again gave lectures in Holland which were rather poorly attended; in Rotterdam, especially, so few people came that we were very discouraged. But he himself thought differently, for in conversation with a friend he remarked that inRotterdam there had been a very good audience. One had the impression that he perceived the worth of certain sofs, and whether a large or small number of people were sitting there was of less importance to him. I was stUl on the medical staff of the mental hospital on one of the islands in South Holland, inwardly rejoicing that I had found the path from Goetheanism to Anthroposophy, and Rudolf Steiner as my teacher from an agelong past But now some older anthro- posophists got together and decided that the work was not j^ro- gressing well, that a group feeling itself spiritually responsibleshould be formed and should place itself at Dr. Steiner's disposal.' I was invited to the meeting, although I emphasised that I was not conversant with the problems of the Society. Nevertheless I welcomed the opportunity of contacting Rudolf Steiner. On every occasion there was an atmosphere of festive happiness, whether I was talking to him about a particular case of illness or some other matter, whether the conversation lasted for half an hour or two minutes. Others besides myself will certainly have had the same experience.A suggestion made with the best possible intentions by someone at the meeting appeared not to please Rudolf Steiner at all. He sat there quietly listening, tapping his foot. I waited in great suspense, wondering what would happen now. \"As long as our Society has such a sectarian character, we shall not progress a single step.\" he said.' A gUQshdt could not have had a more electrifying effect. He went on to say that in the way it was functionmg at present, our Society could not be taken seriously by the outside world. Andthen he told us that a Roman Catholic priest had recently asked him for a talk; at last he had been able to speak with somebody about really important world-affairs; the priest, too, had been delighted and had invited him to visit him. Rudolf Steiner regretted that he had not found time to accept this invitation; he would also 176 177have liked to invite this priest to Domach, but had abandoned the idea because he could not be sure how the members would behave. Finally he asked if there was nobody in Holland capable of lecturing to the public? At this there was silence, because one or two such attempts had been made without success; there had been extremely poor audiences. I had given some very elementary lectures at the wish of the members who thought that a qualied doctor might make more impression; true, a few more people came, but always less than a hundred. When one of the members present expressed the opinion that I had given one or two quite well-attended lectures, it was an astonishment to me as well as to everyone else, when Rudolf Steiner said: \"Well, then, all you need do is to free Dr. Zeylmans for anthroposophical work and offer him a handsome salary.\" He turned to me: \"Would you agree to this, doctor?\" Now I did not consider that my lecturing activities were of any value; I regarded the lectures as having been quite insig nicant, even blundering, performances in which with pain and labour I had strung together the little I knew. But I said: \" Yes, Herr Doktor, if you think I am capable, I will naturally do it gladly.\" He repeated that I must of course be free in order towork for Anthroposophy. After that there was silence; something different had been expected from him. Only one of the members, Peter de Haan, took the matter up, and to him I said, although inwardly embarrassed, that I would try to move to The Hague in order, possibly, to found a clinic and make a living out of my practice. When, soon after this, the Goetheanum was destroyed by re, I was still working in the mental hospital and could not travel to Domach, because although I was allowed more leave for studies than others, the maximiun had already been exceeded. I did not see Dr. Steiner again until the Delegates' Meeting in June, 1923. Although I took part in the discussions on the subject of providingmds for building the new Goetheanum, when I actually spoke to him it was, as usual, mainly about patients. Finally, I also asked him about the statues that had been discovered not long before on the coast of Walcheren. Among them was the statue of a goddess by the name of Nehallenia. I had brought photographs with me and showed them to him. \"Yes,\" he said, \"that is one of the aspects of the Goddess of Fertility, similar to Herta, of Germanic-Celtic origin. Here you can see the fourfold nature of man in dicated: the temple is the physical body, the dog is the etheric body, the astral bodv is indicated bv te fruits, and the child is the un folding ego. More than that, is not vet entirely clear to me. Dne would have to make further investigations in the neighbourhood itself. Tie wWe of the west coast of Holland is important because from time immemorial there has always been a link with Britain.\" The Anthroposophical Societies in the different countries were to be founded anew, and the foxmding of the Society in Hollandwas planned for November, 1923. At The Hague, Rudolf Steiner gave a course of evening lectures with the title Supersensible Man in the light of Anthroposophy. There were also two public lectures and two in the recently founded Clinic (I had now come to live in The Hague); also a number of lectures for members. It was a treinendous programme. Both the little Clinic\u2014established to begin with in a private house\u2014and the little School were now inaugurated, and dedicated in the real sense. I went with a few friends to fetch Dr. Steiner from the station. As the train slowly came in and I saw him sitting at the window, I was shocked by his pallor and look of utter fatigue\u2014and at the same time I saw in Ids face the hallmark of eternity. It was as though the countenance were chiselled out of rock\u2014an impressionthat went through my very bones. Then came the ordinary con ventions: I helped him to get down from the carriage, welcomed those who had come with him\u2014^Frau Dr. Steiner, Myta Waller, Fran Dr. Wegman, Dr. Wachsmuth\u2014and when I was accompany ing him down the stairway leading from the station, I asked if hehad had a good journey. He stopped still in the middle of the stream pf passengers, turned to me and said with surprise: \"What do you mean, a good journey?\" What he wanted to say was sud denly clear to me. I had seen him arrive, our eyes had met, I had seen who he was, and he had seen that I had seen . . . and now I was asking whether he had had a good journey. What he wanted to say was: Wake up! Don't be conventional! We were still standingimmobile in the stream of travellers. \" I mean only whether there were any outer annoyances,\" I said at last. \"Ah, so that is what you mean! Well then, yes, I have had a good journey.\" He visited the little School, which consisted of no more than two or three rooms in a private house, with very few children in three classes, but he conducted the inauguration with as much earnestness and solicitude as if it were already a large School, looked at the children, gave advice about each one individually, in some cases medical advice as well. As the School doctor, I was very often astonished by these medical indications. There was a poor little thin child with an ashen grey skin. \"He is full offear down into his very organs,\" said Dr. Steiner. \" He must do the movement for ' I' (ee) in Curative Eurhythmy while jumping over a rod . . . and then, of course, he must take Prunus spinosdf . . .\" I had never heard of Prunus spinosa, for botany was hardly ever included as a subject at the University, and I felt like a stupid child; everything was so new and full of surprises. \"Hypericum perforatum^ . . . that you surely know? The leaves are all per forated and one can see the drops of oil,\" he said to me as I sat at the back with my notebook. And it continued like this for three whole mornings, wiA the two class teachers, van Bemmelen and Frau Mulder, and the Eurhythmy teacher, Fraulein Hoorweg. 1 B l a c k t h o r n . 2 S t J o h n ' s Wo r tThe Clinic, too, was simply a private house where I worked with one nursing sister; at rst we had only a single patient who regarded herself as a permanent boarder. And again Rudolf Steiner behaved as though a big hospital were being opened. I had collected some 35 doctors and senior medical students for two medical lectures which he then gave. The lectures were surprisingly well received, althou^ it was the rst time that most of those present had heard anything about Anthroposophy. After the second lecture one of the older doctors got up to speak. He said that the lectures had made a great impression upon him, that they represented an integrated system in which, admittedly, there were many gaps, but he realised that these gaps would be closed in further lectures.\" My natural scientic world-view is also an integrated system,\" he added, \" equally with gaps to be lled, but these too may disappear. For which system am I to decide?\" The doctor who put this question was sitting at the very back. Dr. Steiner walked slowly through both parts of the room to him and said: \"You are perfectly right. More cannot really be said. But it is the heart that makes the decision.\" This doctor telephoned to me the next day and said that although he was not entirely convinced, he wanted to give anthroposophical therapy a \"fair chance\", and asked me to treat him for angina pectoris.After the evening lectures, a group of us always went with Rudolf Steiner to his hotel. After he had had food, we sat round an open re in the hall, and conversation continued, often until very far into the night, about new literary publications, political happenings and other subjects. Dr. Steiner was xisually full of cheerfulness, told us anecdotes or answered questions. For example, Herr van Leer asked: \"A wonder-working Rabbi such as the Ba'al Shem^ must surely have had great powers\u2014is he to be regarded as an Initiate?\" \"No, such a man is capable of a very great deal, but was not even a semi-Initiate,\" was the reply. This year, following the burning of the Goetheanum, was marked by the new foxmdation to be given to the Anthroposophical Society. Dr. Steiner, who imtil then was explicitly not an actual member of the Society but wished his task to be only that of teaching ^thro- posophy, was hoping that impulses and efforts sufciently vigorousto give a new form to the work would be forthcoming from the membership itself. A rst step was the founding of independent Societies in the different countries. And so in Holland, too, various enterprises had been set on foot in preparation for the actual founding of the Society in the presence of Dr. Steiner. In speakingon the subject, he had never given more than indications, and one tried to \\mderstand what it was that he really hoped for. But in ^ The famous founder of Hasidism, a religious and profoundly mystical movement which arose among the Polish Jews in the 18th century.many preliminary meetings we really did not get much farther than saying that what was wanted was not an 'organisation' but an' organism'. Many thoughtful ideas with a Goethean trend were expressed in connection with this, but actually we were in a sea of doubt and perplexity. At this time too\u2014^November, 1923\u2014when Dr. Steiner was at The Hague, there were meetings in his presence. Reports were given from the different spheres of work; I, too, had to give anaddress which seemed to me such a poor performance that I felt obliged to apologise to Dr. Steiner. He laughed quite cheerfully,and said: \"TTiat kind of thing is by no means bad; not imtil one has given a hundred lectures can one count upon there having been a good one among them.\" I found this a source of real encomrage- ment. During the discussions about the founding of the Society, Dr.Steiner sat for the most part silently waiting. What he wanted, of course, was that the members themselves should nd what the situation required. While the talk was proceeding, he studied, for example, the mechanism of the writing-tablet of a lady sitting besidehim\u2014the writing could be obliterated by moving a slide; he took out of my hand the tobacco pouch which I had inadvertently drawn from my pocket, scrutinised the zip fastener , then recently invented, and said to me: \"What a pity that one of us did not invent some thing so ingenious!\" On the evening before the actual founding of the Society he was very downhearted and spoke bitter words about the members, saying that they were full of good intentions, but failed to graspwhat was really desired by the spiritual world. We sat there shattered, realising what sorrow lled him and what heavy cares weired upon him. Conversation began again only slowly , andDr. Steiner explained more clearly his disappointment with the Society everywhere and what he found lacking in it. He said, too,that he had given denite promptings; now, instead of taking them up, people came with quite different, totally inadequate proposals.It was late in the night\u2014the next morning, Sunday , 18th November , the actual Foundation Meeting was to take place\u2014when the con versation nally ended. I told Rudolf Steiner that I was wilhng to accept ofce as General Secretary of the Society in HoUand. Quite unexpectedly , the next morning was the happiest that cofd possibly be imagined. We made one blunder after anomer , but Dr Steiner sat there condently , and naUy gave us a dr^ for the Statutes of the Society in Holland. We were to work it out andsubsequently bring it into line with the pnnciples of fe GeneralA n t h r V s o p h i c a l S o c i e t y t o b e f o u n d e d m D o r a a c h a t C h n s t m a s .After lunch he spoke to me about my functions as General Secretary \" Remember ,\" he said, \" from now on you have to bearthe whole esoteric and exoteric responsibihty for everything t^t happens in the anthroposophical domam here in HoUand. He ISOtook both my hands and gazed at me for some time. That was the last meeting in the year 1923, before the Christmas Foundation. * * * * When at Christmas, 1923, we came to Domach for the Founda tion of the General Anthroposophical Society, it was clear to me from the moment when Dr. Steiner \" laid the Foimdation Stone \", that we were witnessing a Mystery-deed that concerned the whole of mankind, the rst Mystery-enactment to be performed openly before the world. True, the eight hundred or so people present were members, but members of such different kinds and stages of development that this deed could certainly be said to have been performed in public. There were friends who felt, as I did, that we had lived through a kind of birth-hour\u2014^now I have been born as a spiritual personality. Gradually it dawned upon me how this laying of the Foundation Stone was connected with the original laying of the Foimdation Stone of the rst Goetheanum on 13th September, 1913. At that time the Foundation Stone was laid in the earth in the form of a double dodecahedron, and the forms of the Goetheanum had been able to arise over it Now, after that Goetheanum had been consmned by re, all its forces and forms and colours, everything it made visible as a kind of embodied Imagination came back from the spiritual world as Inspiration, in the words of the Foundation Stone Meditation at Christmas, 1923. The second impression was connected with what Rudolf Steiner planned as the Free High School of Spiritual Science, with threeclasses. He wanted this High School to be regarded as an institution standing openly in the world; progress through the different classes would depend entirely upon actual inner development. Here, too, the manifest and the secret together: the revealed secret in the Goethean sense. * * * \u00bb During these days I also had talks with Dr. Steiner which shallbe briefly reported here. First of all I asked about a member who had died\u2014she was a painter\u2014and whether it would be possible to form a link with her. Dr. Steiner said: \"One can come near her by recalling a definite moment of importance\u2014^for example, whenone was looking at a picture while she was actually painting it. Such a situation should be visualised in all detail; then, when it! becomes a vivid experience, one should damp down the waking consciousness, allow what is now living inwardly in it to flow on,and then bear it up to her in the spiritual world, waiting in stillness for a response. That is how contact can be established.\" Another time I asked him about the work now devolving upon me in Holland, saying that I found it very difcult to carry out my duties as a medical practitioner, to help in promoting understanding of anthroposophical medicine, and now also to shoulder the tasksincumbent upon the General Secretary of the Society . I found the last\u2014the work for the Society\u2014especially difficult, for I was less interested in it than in Anthroposophy itself. \"But it is your karma and nothing can be done about it,\" he said. As we talked on he repeated this, and yet a third time at the end. In reply to my remark that I found it extremely difcult to combine the functions of doctor and General Secretary, he said: \" It is a very good tl^g that you, a doctor, should be the General Secretary, for the Society will more and more be in need of healing.\" And about fei work he said: \" Everything will develop in time, but the rst thing to be done is to get the High School established. As for the problems of the Society, you may think of them like this: the Society imposes tasks all the time; it is in the loneliness of the soul that the solutions are found.\" \u00bb * \u00bb * Mention shall also be made of the meeting I had with him in Paris in May, 1924. He gave a lecture in the Salle Solferino, in the Boulevard St. Germain. Jules Sauerwein, foreign editor of Le Matin, translated, and Edouard Schurd, then a very old man, was among the Usteners. Between the lectures for the members and all the other demands on Rudolf Steiner I was able, to my joy; to speak with him at some length about the work in Holland. TTie conversation was always serious and at the same time cheerful. Then one morning I went for a walk, and in the precincts of Notre Dame met Rudolf Steiner and Frau Dr . Wegman coming across the great Square; they had evidently just been in theCathedral. I went up to them. \"Have you already been in the Sainte Chapelle?\" I asked, meaning the historic thirteenth-century Chapel that had once been the scene of ery disputations betweenthe great Dominican scholars of the Sorbonne and those known as the Arabists. \" That is just where w\u00a9 want to go,\" answered Dr. Wegman, \"but how does one get to it?\" As I had just come fromthere, I showed them the way through the gate, pointed to the little tower that was visible from where we were standing . . . and that was all. Y et the incident seemed to me to mean more than can be put into words. During the Christmas Meeting I had already asked Dr. Steiner if he would be willing to give a course of lectiures on education to us in Holland, and he himself at once suggested the dates. \" Whatexactly do you want me to do fen?\" I produced my list ofrequests\u2014^first, a public course on education; secondly , one or twopublic lectures on medical themes; and thurdly , toee lectures formembers. He agreed to the whole programme without hesitation.T w o o t h e r s p e c i a l m e e t i n g s a n d a n a d d r e s s t o y o u n g p e o p l e w e r e s u b s e q u e n t l y a d d e d . , , ,W e had given a great deal of thought as to where these lecture ought to be held, had visited several l^ely places and had naUy deaded on Amhem, because a ne conference hall on the banks of 182the Rhine could be rented there. In the neighbourhood there were also memorials of ancient Germanic times, and historic traditions of that kind are rare on the young soil of HoUand. In short, we were convinced we had foimd the right place. But when Rudolf Steiner arrived and was driving to his hotel, he glanced around him and said: \" Surely this is a kind of holiday resort? Apparently it is becoming more and more the custom to combine anthro- posophical studies with a summer holiday.\" At this we all felt a little embarrassed. Shortly before I had been obliged to make one of the most difcult decisions in my life. Dr. Steiner had telegraphed that as he would be late in arriving, he would not be able to give his rst lecture. On 17th July, 1924, when Peter de Haan, Michael Tschechow, another Russian actor and I fetched him from the station at the time indicated, I was appalled to see how deadly tired and iU hp looked. We went to the car, and even before it started he said to me: \"So I was not able to give my rst lecture this morning. What do you think. Doctor\u2014ought I to make up for it by giving a lecture this afternoon?\" I had been obliged to give the opening lecture myself, because several public ofcials and important guests had come to hear it. Dr. Steiner was aware of this. Frau Marie Steiner insisted that a lecture was out of the question because Dr. Steiner was exhausted after the many sessionsin Stuttgart and simply must rest this afternoon. One coxdd fully sympathise with this, but Dr. Steiner, quite unperturbed, looked only at me and repeated that it was for me to decide, since I was responsible for these meetings. \" Do you think I should or shouldnot give this lecture?\" Again Frau Marie Steiner interjected that it was out of the question, and again Dr. Steiner emphasised that it was up to me to decide; it was my responsibility. Ever3dhing in me cried: Rest, rest, cancel the whole programme! But on the other part I tiiought: other laws hold sway here. At last I said:\" Herr Doktor, I believe you should give the lecture.\" He replied quieUy\u2014^very well then, he would give it. During these meetings it was impossible not to realise how illRudolf Steiner was. When others were lecturmg\u2014^Dr. Schubert, Dr. von Baravalle, Mr. Van Bemmelen, Mr. Stibbe and I\u2014^it was heartbreaking to see how exhausted he seemed to be; I noticed,too, with grave anxiety, how emaciated he had become. For all that it was evident on every occasion that in spite of utmost fatigue nothing escaped his attention, and when he was standing at thelecture-desk he was, as always, sparkling with re, full of life and vitality\u2014one could hardly realise that this was the same man. Itwas profoundly moving that in the lectures on education, as well as in the address to young people, he should have spoken about Schiller and Schiller's death, about the re of enfusiasm which consumes a man's being, about Schiller's heart which, at the end, appeared to be almost devoid of physical substance. The inevitablei m p r e s s i o n w a s t h a t t h e r e , i n f r o n t o f o n e , w a s a n i l l u s t r a t i o n o fwhat he was speaking about: the re consuming the body . At that time in Amhem I was also able to have talks with him, and asked for advice in the dilemma of having to speak in pwhc about anthroposophical matters of which one knew so little fromdirect personal experience. \"Y ou may speak about anything m my courses and lectures provided you take care that a year haspassed since you studied it,\" he answered. We also spoke aboutanother question of principle: that all expressions of modern cultural development to be perceived in pamting and literature had always fascinated me, and fat I should nd it very difcmt to put all this aside. He answered: \"Your attitude should be tfs. You should always have the greatest imaginable tolerance for what comes to manifestation in the world, while at the same time teaming yourself to let the strictest truth hold sway in presenting .^^o- posophy .\" I realised that this must be the gmdmg prmciple m m y w o r k . . . . .One evening during those days a few of us were together wif him, discussing the point that the ' International Laboratories mArlesheim, where the medicaments were should at^tbe given an appropriate name.

(Anthroposophical Publishing Co.) 184with a rug over him and gave us a last injunction. I had then to return to my work in Holland. On 30th March, 1925, his death summoned us to Domach. We shared the vigil by his death-bed, and some accoimt shall now be given of the last night and the direct impressions I received at that time.^ * * * * Rudolf Steiner lay there in his studio, on his death-bed. What his spirit revealed to me through the picture of death\u2014of this I will try to speak. It will be but a feeble stammering, for only the divine-gifted poet can say what is beyond all speech. ... It was a picture of the joy of gods and the sorrowing of men. \"The friend of God, and the leader of mankind,\" as Albert Steffen called him, had passed through the gate of death. Outside in nature the gods were celebrating a festival, because the great leader of mankind came to them. Within, around the death-bed, men were mourning because the friend of God was taken from them. Out side, the Spring arrived. The birds suddenly began to sing The joy of resurrection lived in the plants and animals. The joy ofresurrection sought its way to man, entered through his senses, and sank down into his heart. Within, around the death-bed, stood the mourners, and gazed, stricken with grief, upon the beloved countenance. Memories, the most precious and beautiful of their lives, arose. Grief convulsed their souls or was packed away in their hearts. Thus the joy of resurrection and the pain of death met with one another: heavenly joy and human pain. How wonderful he looked on the rst day after his death! As in a light sleep\u2014so peaceful and thoughtful\u2014as if he could awaken at any moment, to tell us what his spirit experienced there above with the gods. His death had been a prayer, so we were told. He lay for hours in deepest meditation, gazing into far distances. Then his medita tion became more and more a prayer. He lay motionless with folded hands. Only a few words had he spoken to his intimate friend and nurse. Dr. We^an. It was only after some hours that he closed his eyes and died\u2014^without any agony of death. His prayer on earth was ended.But to us, it w^ as if his spirit continued to pray, as if his mighty prayer moved through our sorrowing souls. And in our hearts, where the joy of resurrection and the pain of death were, something blossomed forth and soared aloft, borne upward by his prayer. And that which was for each individual a prayer of thanksgiving became for us all collectively a sure picture of the future. On the second day, it seemed to me different. There now lay a shadow of grief upon his countenance. It was as if something of 1 This account appeared in Anthroposophical Movement, Vol. II, No. 16, 19th April, 1925. 186the grief of the many hundred of friends who came together from many lands was reflected in this countenance. It was more difcult now to experience the joy of resurrection. But from his shining brow solemn and happy thoughts seemed to oat upwards. Then came the third day. Again a change had taken place. One now saw the face \"of a saint\u2014griefless and sinless. A face that appeared super-humanly great\u2014but which contained in miniature everything that is good and true and beautiful. Separated from usfar beyond our reach\u2014but at the same time near; godlike, but containing all things human. His noble brow was even moreradiant than before. In his deep-set eyes, world-secrets lay hidden. His mouth spoke cosmic language. Never were there such hands. They were as strong as the hands of one accustomed to heavymanual labour. But they were spiritualised right into the very muscular bres. With them he had chiselled the hard wood; with them he had written his clear, flowing writing To countless mun- bers he had over and over again given his hand, and everyone had felt it as a blessing. . . . Six doctors and four others who were near friends of Dr. Steiner were allowed, during the last night, to keep the vigil, two by two. The hours we passed there were full of unforgettable beauty and holiness. It was a still and peaceful spring night. The moon shone bright like a sun. Black demoniac-looking clouds tried over andover again to darken her radiance\u2014but she threw the sunlight to the earth ever more brightly. In the studio, now in the cofn, lay the body, unlike any other body of the dead. Lighted candles around threw their golden light upon the black cofn. The scent of flowers lled the air, speakinga delicate language of the soul. The statue of the Christ, with its gestures expressive of world-destiny, rose great and silent at the foot of the cofn. On the right and on the left two of us stood watching, guarding the candles fliat they might burn with an even and quiet flame. How strange and mysterious everything seemed, and yet at the same time how familiar. Pictures from a long, long past rose before us, gleaming like silver in the candlelight\u2014and disappeared. Surely we had been at this scene before ITien all at once we knew: this is an event that is beyond all time. It points into the long-distant past and into the still more distant future. Past and future are here molten into one and form together an eternal, macrocosmic picture\u2014a picture of the Divine guidance of man and of his cosmic destiny .Some friends came in and a death-mask was taken. We stood around in silence. When it was evident that the mask had turned out well, we thought with joy: Now, through long years to come, many more will be able to see this expression of deepest wisdom, tenderest love and greatest holiness. The birds were now singing in the early dawn. . . . 187We know well that difcult times are before us. But for every one who in his sorrowing heart has entered into the meaning of the Festival of the Resurrection, the difcult times will be only times of testing\u2014^trials of soul that he will have strength to endure.
