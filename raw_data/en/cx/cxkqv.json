EMPLOYEE FAQs Frequently Asked Questions about the Division of Retirement and Benefits' Employee Health plan and programs. The PERS DB Plan For employees who first entered prior to July 1, 2006, the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) is a defined benefit (DB) plan which is designed to offer a lifetime monthly benefit once retirement eligibility is reached. Your retirement from the plan, provided you do not refund your contributions, will be determined by a formula defined in statute. Unlike a defined contribution account, your benefit is not based on the amount of money in your contribution account. For anyone who first entered after July 1, 2006, the PERS is a defined contribution retirement plan (DCR Plan). [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) PERS provides benefits for active members as well as pension and medical benefits at retirement. Qualifying active members have occupational disability and death benefits available upon entry to PERS. These benefits expand to disability and death benefits resulting from nonoccupational causes once a member is vested. For members who reach retirement eligibility, PERS provides a lifetime pension benefit with options to provide continuing benefits to a surviving spouse. Along with the pension benefit, PERS also offers a retiree medical plan, Dental-Vision-Audio coverage, and Long-Term Care coverage. Once retired, eligible members receive a cost of living increase to their PERS benefits once per year if there has been a raise in the cost of living in the previous year. Retired members who are principally domiciled and physically present in Alaska and receiving a monthly pension may also be eligible for an additional after-retirement increase of 10% of their base pension benefit. This increase is paid on a monthly basis for as long as the member is eligible. The PERS is administered by the Division of Retirement and Benefits. The division director is the administrator of the plan. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) PERS is currently a three tiered system with each tier determined by the date a person first became employed with a PERS employer in a PERS-covered position, was receiving compensation and making PERS contributions. This is commonly referred to as your entry or enrollment date. The tiers establish when a member is eligible for retirement and the after-retirement increases as well as when and if medical premiums are paid by the retirement system or are paid by the member. Tier III members also have a slightly different benefit calculation from Tiers I and II. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) PERS DB Vesting A PERS DB member is vested when they have at least 5 paid-up years of membership service. Once you are vested, you may terminate PERS employment and still receive a monthly retirement benefit when you reach retirement age. However, you must leave your contributions in the PERS to stay vested. As an active employee in the PERS DB, vesting also expands your death and disability benefits. Prior to vesting, both occupational death and disability monthly benefits are available to apply for in the case of injuries or illnesses arising from occupational causes. Only vested members, however, have monthly benefits upon approval for death or disability resulting from nonoccupational causes. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Claimed service does not count towards vesting. Members must have 5 years of paid up membership service. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) The PERS does not provide notification of vesting. Since full-time service accrues on a calendar day for day basis, members can determine their vesting date by adding their paid up service periods until a total of five years is obtained. Part-time members can determine their service by dividing their hours worked each year by 1,560 to determine their service for that year (the service earned per year cannot exceed one year). Members needing assistance can contact the PERS. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) PERS DB Service Credit Full-time members of the PERS earn a day of service credit for each day they are actively employed in a PERS-covered position. This includes holidays or regularly scheduled days off (RDO) as long as you are in pay status the day before and the day after the holiday or RDO. Part-time members of the PERS, those who work at least 15 hours per week but less than 30 hours per week, receive credit for the number of hours they work. A total of 1,560 hours must be earned to receive a year of service credit. However, service accrued for a stated period of part time service may not exceed the full-time equivalent. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) The PERS issues a member statement once each year. The statement includes your total service accrual as of the date of the statement as well as an accounting of all the contributions, indebtedness payments made and interest earned for the year. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Your employer reports your service and contributions to the PERS each pay period. If you believe your service is in error, you should contact your employer first. If the employer agrees that there has been an error in reporting, they can correct the error on their next payroll processing or, if they are not able to make the correction that way, they can contact the Division for assistance. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) PERS DB Pension Benefits at Retirement This is a common misconception. Your contribution balance does not reflect the true value of your PERS DB pension benefit since it only includes any contributions you have made (as well as any indebtedness payments and interest earned). The employer contributions only become available to members when they qualify and begin to receive a lifetime monthly pension benefit. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Your pension benefit is calculated using a formula comprised of a multiplier times your average monthly salary (AMS) times the total years of service you have at retirement. PERS is designed to reward longevity, so the multiplier increases at certain key points in a members service. For \"All Other\" members, the formula is: - 2% x AMS x years of service up to 10 and all years served prior to July 1, 1986; plus - 2.25% x AMS x years of service over ten served after July 1, 1986; plus - 2.5% x AMS x years of service over twenty. For \"Police/Fire\" members, the formula is: - 2% x AMS x years of service up to 10; plus - 2.5% x AMS x years of service over ten [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Highly compensated employees may become subject to the salary limitations under IRS 401(a)(17) if they earn more than the maximum allowed salary for the year. If salaries exceed the limit ($265,000 for 2015) contributions will cease to be taken from their salaries until the start of the next tax year. Any contributions taken in error will be refunded, with interest, to the member and will represent taxable income. Members receiving a refund of contributions under this provision will receive a 1099 at the end of the tax year. If you are more than 5 years from retirement eligibility, you can obtain a projection by logging into the myRnB and using the PERS Benefit Estimator. If you are within 5 years or less from retirement eligibility, you should contact the Member Service Center and order a projection of benefits. Requests are processed in the order they are received. You should allow 15 working days for processing. [Contact Us](/contact/center.html) Yes. If you are married, you are required to select a joint and survivor option unless your spouse consents to another form of benefit payment. With the election of a joint and survivor option, your benefit is reduced slightly to provide pension and medical benefits for your spouse for the remainder of their lifetime. PERS provides two levels of survivor payment, 50% of your reduced benefit or 75% of your reduced benefit. If your spouse dies first, your benefit does not change. Along with the pension benefit, health insurance eligibility will continue. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html) With no survivor benefit election, all benefits cease at your death, including the health insurance. Your spouse would receive your last pension check and the balance of your contribution account, if any, at the time of your death. Your spouse would also be given an opportunity to purchase health insurance for a limited time under the federal COBRA plan. Please refer to the PERS Information Handbook on this web site for more detailed information regarding calculation of average monthly salary, survivor options and early retirement reductions. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html) PERS DB Medical Benefits at Retirement Most likely the State of Alaska Retiree Health Plan will differ from the insurance plan you have as an active PERS employee. One of the prime differences is that coverage for medical service and dental, vision and audio services are separate options. The Medical plan includes coverage for hospitalization, medical, surgical, maternity care and other service necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of an injury or disease for you and your eligible dependents. The health care coverage is good worldwide. The Dental-Vision-Audio (DVA) plan is an optional plan that all DB retirees have an opportunity to elect. Another optional plan available to DB retirees is Long-Term Care Insurance (LTC). [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html) While all retirees receive the same level of coverage under the Retiree Medical Plan, payment of premiums for this coverage depends on which tier you are in. The PERS is currently a three-tier plan with different requirements for premium payment and eligibility for the medical insurance. Tier I members are eligible for family medical coverage at retirement, whether an early or a normal retirement, with no premium payment. Tier II members have access to medical coverage at retirement, whether an early or a normal retirement. \"All other\" PERS members who retire early, between age 55 and 60, must pay full premium for coverage until age 60. At age 60, medical coverage is provided with no premium payment. \"All other\" PERS members who retire with a normal benefit at any age with 30 years of service or who are vested and at least age 60 are eligible for medical coverage at retirement with no premium payment. \"Police/Fire\" PERS members who retire under age 60 with less than 25 years of service must pay full premium for coverage until age 60. At age 60, medical coverage is provided free with no premium payment. \"Police/Fire\" PERS members who retire with 25 or more years of service are eligible for medical coverage at retirement with no premium payment. Tier III members are eligible for the same benefits as Tier II if they retire with 10 years of credited service. If they retire with less than 10 years of credited service, full premium must be paid for as long as coverage is desired. All tiers must pay a premium for the optional DVA and LTC plans. Premium rates for these plans are the same for all tiers. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) No. Only surviving spouses or eligible dependent children of the member can be covered under the medical plan. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) The member must: - Have first entered PERS service after June 30, 1986, and before July 1, 1996 (PERS DB Tiers II or III) - Be an honorably discharged member of the armed forces of the United States - Have at least 20 years of paid- up membership service in the Peace Officer and/or Firefighter occupation classification - Not be receiving, or eligible to receive, a federal retirement benefit for the same military service being claimed - Have submitted a claim for military service credit for use in the retirement benefit calculation PERS DB members have been able to claim up to five years of military service in the armed forces of the United States for additional credit towards the calculation of retirement benefits since 1960. The basic formula for calculating retirement benefits is: (average monthly salary) x (a benefit multiplier) x (total years of service). Claiming military service allows a member to receive an increased retirement benefit by increasing the total years of service used in the benefit calculation. HB 116 allows peace officers and firefighters in PERS Tiers II and III who have claimed military service for credit towards the calculation of their retirement benefit to additionally claim up to five years of the same military service to meet the 25-year service requirement necessary to obtain premium-free retiree medical benefits. Claiming military service under HB 116 does not add additional service towards the calculation of the retirement benefit. The claimed military service must be active-duty service in the armed forces of the United States for which the member received an honorable discharge. (Members called to active duty directly from PERS employment who return to employment within 90 days of discharge receive PERS service credit. This is not considered \"claimed military service\" but actual PERS membership service.) Members may claim up to five years of military service for which they have received an honorable discharge but must first claim military service for use in the retirement benefit calculation. Claiming military service under HB 116 does not add additional service towards the calculation of the retirement benefit. Only need to claim the amount of military claimed service needed to reach the 25-year requirement for premium free medical. No. The cost to claim military service to meet the 25-year service credit requirement to obtain premium-free retiree medical benefits is separate from the cost to claim military service to increase a retirement benefit. You must file a separate request to claim military service for purposes of obtaining premium-free retiree medical coverage. Claiming military service under HB 116 does not add additional service towards the calculation of the retirement benefit. The cost for the claim will be calculated at the time the member retires. Members may pay all or part of the cost prior to appointment to retirement. Any balance due can be paid for in the form of an actuarially determined reduction to the member's retirement benefit thereby allowing the member to pay the cost over his/her lifetime after retirement. No. While the legislation was effective immediately upon signature by the Governor, there is no provision for retroactive application. However, a Peace Officer or Firefighter who retired prior to July 11, 2014, and is re-employed as a Peace Officer or Firefighter in PERS may claim military service upon application for an additional retirement benefit. No. A member cannot claim military service for either an increased pension benefit or for premium-free retiree medical benefit if the member is entitled to receive retirement benefits from the United States government for the same service. Yes, a member may claim only that amount of military service needed to meet the 25-year eligibility requirement for obtaining premium-free retiree medical benefits. Members who have already claimed military service for use in their retirement benefit calculation may request cost estimates to claim military service for premium-free medical within one year of retirement by calling the Division's Member Service Center toll-free at (800) 821-2251 or in Juneau at (907) 465-4460, or by email at doa.drb.mscc@alaska.gov. Estimates will typically be provided within 10 days of the member requesting the cost estimate. Once vested, a member can claim up to 5 years of military service to be used in the calculation of their retirement benefit by completing and submitting the Application for Military Service Credit for Benefit Calculation (2-1895) and providing a copy of their DD214 showing the dates of military service being claimed and an honorable discharge. To additionally claim the service under HB 116, the member can complete and submit the Application for Peace Officer/Firefighter Military Service Credit for Medical Eligibility (02-1897) at the time of retirement. The above information is provided in an effort to give affected members a general overview of recently adopted legislation affecting the benefits of certain PERS DB members. This information does not constitute formal pension, legal or tax advice and is not specific to any individual's circumstances. Members should consult with a pension counselor before making decisions regarding the claiming of military service. In the event of a conflict between the information contained herein and the plan document, the plan document shall control. PERS DB Contribution Questions Your contribution account balance and any information related to your account is available to you upon proper identification. Administrative regulations do not allow us to release information regarding personal or financial data to anyone other than the member without the member's prior written authorization unless the inquiring party has a subpoena or a court order to secure the information. We are allowed to release the information to the member's employer, former employer, or other authorized state agency. A member's spouse or legal counsel is NOT entitled to the member's information without a properly executed release. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) No! Your account balance is not available to you until you are terminated from employment. Layoff or leave without pay status is not termination for purposes of obtaining a refund. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) You always have the option of leaving the money in your account. If you are a vested member intending to retire in the future, or are a nonvested member and intend to become re-employed in a covered position in the future, it may be wise to do so. Warning: If you refund your contributions and do not return to PERS-covered employment before July 1, 2010, you will forfeit the service and your tier. If you return to PERS-covered employment on or after July 1, 2010, you will be enrolled in the PERS/TRS DCR Plan. If you refund your account, you become a former member and forfeit any rights you had as a member. If you refund your account, you must take a full refund. You cannot obtain a partial refund. If you are nonvested (less than five paid years of service) or single, completing the form is sufficient. If you are a married and vested member, your spouse must consent to the refund on a form provided by the Division of Retirement and Benefits. This form must be notarized. If the rights to your refund are subject to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO), you must also provide the notarized consent of each person entitled under the order. Complete the [Refund Election form (gen008)](/docs/forms/gen008.pdf) form to obtain a refund of your contribution account balance. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) You should have completed form the Refund Election form which tells us your intentions concerning your refund. If you did not, contact your employer or contact us directly. There is a minimum waiting period of 60 days from your termination date or 30 days from the receipt of your application, whichever is later, before your refund will be processed. This is to make sure your employer has transmitted all of your contributions and your account can be refunded in full. There would be another week to ten days processing and mailing time once the waiting period has been met. Complete the [Refund Election form (gen008)](/docs/forms/gen008.pdf) form to obtain a refund of your contribution account balance. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) First, the Division of Retirement and Benefits and the State of Alaska do not provide tax advice. Each member's tax situation is unique and you must consider the affect on your individual taxes. You should consult with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and a consultant as you deem necessary. Contributions placed in the PERS before July 1, 1986, is \"post-tax\" contributions. The contributions have already been taxed and you should owe no further tax on them. The interest earnings from these periods are still subject to income taxes. Contributions and interest placed in the PERS on or after July 1, 1986, is \"pretax\" contributions. These contributions have not been taxed previously. Therefore, both the contributions and interest earned on these amounts are subject to income tax. In January following the year in which a refund is made, members will receive a 1099R informational return which indicates the amount of the taxable and nontaxable portions. For the \"pretax\" contributions, if you choose to have the refund sent directly to you at your address or to your regular account at a banking institution, the IRS requires that we withhold 20% of the taxable portion of your refund, even if you later choose to do a \"rollover\" within the 60 day rollover period. You may also be subject to an additional early withdrawal penalty if you receive the refund before age 59\u00bd. You can avoid the withholding tax on the portion of your refund that you have us \"Direct Transfer\" to another qualified plan that accepts your transfer, such as an IRA. Only the taxable portion of your refund can be transferred. If your refund includes money that has already been taxed, we will refund that portion directly to you without withholding any taxes on it. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) You must arrange for another qualified plan, such as an Individual Retirement Arrangement / Account (IRA), to accept a direct transfer of your taxable contribution account balance. Once you have arranged for an institution to accept this transfer, you would complete a Notification of Termination/Refund Application form filling in the appropriate information. Be sure to include the plan name, address, plan contact person, and your account number. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Generally, except for a few exceptions, employee contributions and other amounts held in the system are exempt from levy to enforce the collection of a debt, and are not subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or charge of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, without first being received by the person entitled to the amount under the terms of the system. The exceptions primarily include unpaid state, local, or federal taxes, a Child Support Enforcement Order for unpaid child support, and up to one month's unpaid earnings of an individual employed by a member. In addition, a member's right to receive benefits may be assigned by a Qualified Domestic Relations Order as a result of a divorce or dissolution. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Until an employee terminates employment or is appointed to retirement, the employee has no right to receive his regular contribution account balance, and therefore, it cannot be distributed at that time. However, while we will not distribute your account balance, we will place a hold on your account. A valid attachment (see the answer to question 10), still in effect when the employee terminates, or is appointed to retirement, will be honored at that time. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Yes! If we are forced to honor a valid attachment (see the answer to question 10), a member becomes a former member and loses any rights he or she may have had as a member. Even if the attachment is for a portion of your account balance, we would be forced to refund the balance to you, since there can be no partial refunds from the system. In this instance, an involuntary refund, plus any accumulated accrued interest, may be repaid to the system to reinstate your service without becoming re-employed in a system-covered position. However, if the original attachment is still in effect, any repayments will be forwarded to the appropriate agency to satisfy any amount still due. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) The Division of Retirement and Benefits takes a critical view of what constitutes an emergency. For any emergency consideration, you must request a waiver in writing, and provide sufficient proof of your emergency. If you have other extenuating circumstances that you feel warrant consideration, you must provide a written detailed description to us along with your request for a waiver. If a waiver is granted in that case, a refund will be processed as soon as your employer has transmitted all of the contributions that were withheld from your pay (generally at least 30 days). [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) After receiving verification that your indebtedness has been established, you may make payments on your indebtedness directly to the Division of Retirement and Benefits either in full or with periodic payments over time. If you intend a payment to pay off your indebtedness balance, you should contact us for the balance. You may also establish a monthly payroll deduction through your employer. We can estimate when your indebtedness would be paid in full based on the amount of deduction you set up. If you have not received verification that your indebtedness has been established, contact us. Interest on your indebtedness will continue to accrue until your indebtedness is paid in full. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) The interest rate for the PERS is 7%, compounded semiannually. Interest on an indebtedness is posted monthly (see question below regarding interest posting). [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) If you have not completely paid your indebtedness by the time you retire, your monthly benefits will be actuarially reduced over your lifetime, unless the reduction causes your benefit to be less than what it would have been without the service related to your indebtedness. If that is the case, your indebtedness payments would be refunded to you. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Interest posts to an account during the last monthly processing cycle during the last week of the month. Your indebtedness payments must be received by the cutoff for input to that processing. Please call the Division for cutoff times. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) No. Nonvested members whose employer has elected to participate in the conversion option may choose to transfer to the new plan. The decision to elect to convert to the new plan is solely the eligible employee's choice. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) The window period for election begins on the date the resolution to participate is approved by the PERS Administrator and ends 12 months later or when the member vests, whichever occurs first. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Yes and No. Since you are not an active employee with your former employer, you do not have the option to convert to the new plan. However, if you reemploy with your former employer before you vest and before the 12 month conversion period ends, you may elect conversion. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) No. Only the employer you are currently working for must agree to participate in the conversion option. Your current employer is responsible for matching the balance of your employee contribution account up to the allowable limits of the IRC Sec. 415(c) regardless of which PERS employer you may have earned service with in the past. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) PERS DB Death & Disability Benefits PERS death benefits are determined by several things--whether the death is from occupational or nonoccupational causes, if the member was vested or not vested (nonoccupational), how much total service the member had, and if they are actively employed or retired at the time of death. In general, monthly survivor benefits are provided for spouses and dependent children if the death is from occupational causes. These benefits include both pension and medical benefits. If the member is not married and has no dependent children, a lump sum payment is made to the named beneficiary. If the member dies from nonoccupational causes and is not vested, only a lump sum benefit is available to the beneficiary. If the member dies from nonoccupational causes and is vested, a surviving spouse has the choice of receiving a monthly survivor benefit, including pension and health, or a lump sum payment. If the member is not married, a lump sum payment is made to the named beneficiary. [Learn More](/employee/lifedisability.html) PERS does not provide short-term disability benefits. It provides disability benefits for occupational and nonoccupational causes for those members who are totally and presumably permanently disabled because of a physical or mental condition. All PERS members are eligible to apply for occupational disability. Only vested PERS members, however, may apply for nonoccupational disability benefits. The PERS administrator reviews all applications for disability benefits and the substantiating medical documentation with the assistance of a consulting physician. After a disability application is approved and employment has been terminated, disability benefits will commence. [Learn More](/employee/lifedisability.html) The TRS DB Plan For members who first entered the Teachers' Retirement System (TRS) on or before June 30, 2006, the TRS is a Defined Benefit (DB) plan. Your eventual benefit from the plan, if you do not refund your account, is based upon a computation method defined in statute and regulation. It is not based on the amount of money in your refundable account. For anyone hired after July 1, 2006, the TRS is a defined contribution retirement plan (DCR Plan). [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) The TRS is administered by the Division Director, Division of Retirement and Benefits. [Contact Us](/contact/center.html) You should contact your employer and ask them to submit a change of address for you. If you have trouble getting your address changed through your employer, you should contact the Division of Retirement and Benefits, Accounting Section. If you are retired or no longer working for a TRS employer, you should complete a change of address card and send it to the Division. TRS DB Vesting You will be vested when you have at least: - eight paid-up years of membership service; or - five paid-up years of membership service and three paid-up years of Alaska Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) service; or - fifteen years of paid-up credited service, if the last five years are membership service and you were first hired under the TRS before July 1, 1975; or - twelve paid-up years of combined part-time and full-time TRS membership service. You must have at least one-half year of membership service as a part-time teacher or one full year of membership service as a full-time teacher in each of twelve school years. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Periods of Leave Without Pay (LWOP), whether considered \"active\" or \"inactive,\" cannot be used to satisfy vesting or retirement eligibility. This would extend the length of time needed to vest or meet eligibility for a service based retirement. [Learn More](/employee/leave.html) For \"active\" LWOP you must pay both the employee and employer contributions to the TRS each month while on LWOP. Contributions should be paid through your payroll office. For \"inactive\" LWOP you are not required to pay TRS contributions while on LWOP. When you return to work and claim LWOP, an indebtedness equal to the employee and employer contributions will be established. [Learn More](/employee/leave.html) TRS DB Service Credit You can purchase outside teaching service, Alaska Bureau of Indian Affairs service, or Military service. These are explained in greater detail in other questions and answers. Part-time members of the PERS, those who work at least 15 hours per week but less than 30 hours per week, receive credit for the number of hours they work. A total of 1,560 hours must be earned to receive a year of service credit. However, service accrued for a stated period of part time service may not exceed the full-time equivalent. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) You are eligible to claim up to 10 years of full-time service in an out of state school or Alaska private school if you were a: - certified elementary or secondary teacher or certified employee in a position which requires a teaching certificate as a condition of employment in an out-of-state public school either inside or outside the United States supported by U.S. funds, or an approved or accredited nonpublic school either inside or outside the United States supported by U.S. funds; or - employment in an out-of-state institution of higher learning requiring academic standing and accreditation by a nationally recognized accrediting agency listed in the Education Directory, Colleges and Universities, by the National Center for Education Statistics; or - teacher in an approved or accredited nonpublic institution of higher learning in Alaska. The cost to purchase outside experience will vary depending upon your entry date and entry base salary after the service was performed in the Alaska TRS. Please contact the Division of Retirement and Benefits for cost information. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) You may claim service as a full-time certified teacher in a position which requires a teaching certificate as a condition of employment; or a professional educator. Alaska BIA service may count toward vesting and retirement eligibility. The cost is based on your entry in the Alaska TRS after the service was performed. If your entry was before July 1, 1970, you will be charged 5% of base salary for each year of Alaska BIA. If your entry was after June 30, 1970, you will be charged 7% of base salary for each year of Alaska BIA and if your entry was after June 30, 1990, the charge is 8.65% of base salary. If you receive a federal benefit based on Alaska BIA, the Alaska TRS will offset their benefits by the amount you receive in federal benefits for that service. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) You can purchase up to five years of active service including active duty National Guard time. If you were first hired in the TRS after June 30, 1990, and are eligible for a federal benefit based on the same service, you cannot claim the service in the TRS. The cost for eligible service is 7% of your base salary for each year claimed, if you were hired prior to July 1, 1990, or 8.65% of your base salary for each year claimed, if you vested after June 31, 1990. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Members cannot receive duplicate credit in PERS except as an elected official. Benefits are payable if you are retired in the TRS and you meet the following: - the service occurs while you are a full-time TRS employee; - the service is with a municipality or political subdivision that is participating in the PERS at the time the elected service occurs; - you are compensated for the elected service; and - you pay the mandatory PERS contributions for the elected service (6.75% of salary). [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) TRS DB Pension Benefits at Retirement If you meet retirement eligibility based on age and you were first hired in a TRS-covered position before July 1, 1990, you can retire with an early reduced benefit at age 50. Normal retirement is age 55. If you were first hired in a TRS-covered position after June 30, 1990, but before July 1, 2006, you can retire with an early reduced benefit at age 55. Normal retirement is age 60. You may retire from the TRS DB plan at any age with unreduced benefits if you have: - 20 paid-up years of TRS membership service; - 20 paid-up years of combined TRS membership and Alaska BIA service, if the last five years are membership service; - 20 paid-up years of combined years of part-time and full-time TRS membership service (you must have at least one-half year of membership service as a part-time teacher or one full year of membership service as a full-time teacher in each of 20 school years; or - 25 paid-up years of credited service, if the last five years are TRS membership service.

The benefit is calculated based upon the following calculation: - 2% * first 20 years * average base salary, plus - 2.5% * all years over 20 * average base salary (All service creditable before July 1, 1990, will be calculated using the 2% multiplier.) Average base salary is calculated on the three highest salary years during your TRS employment. Salaries that exceed the maximum salary limit under the IRS 401(a)(17) limits cannot be used in the calculation. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Yes. State law requires that a married member select a survivor option unless their spouse waives their entitlement to survivor benefits. If survivor benefits are waived, benefits will not continue past the member's death. If health insurance benefits were payable, they will also be discontinued at the retiree's death unless a survivor benefit was elected at retirement. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html) Members who were first hired before July 1, 1982, and have made the additional 1% contribution for one year, may provide survivor's benefits to their spouses and eligible dependent children upon their death. There are two aspects to the benefit. The first is provided if there are dependent children. The monthly benefit is equal to: - 35% of base salary at the time of death paid to the surviving spouse - 10% for each dependent child, up to a maximum of 4 children - 10% for each court-appointed guardian. When there is no longer any dependent children, the surviving spouse will receive a benefit based on 50% of the retirement benefit the member was receiving at the time of death, or 50% of the benefit the member had accrued at the time of death. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html) Yes, the TRS provides automatic increases to retiree benefits. The Post Pension Retirement Adjustment (PRPA) is calculated, effective July 1 each year, by multiplying the recipient's base benefit, including past PRPAs, times: - 75% of the cost of living increase in the preceding calendar year or 9%, whichever is less, if the recipient is at least age 65 or on TRS disability on July 1; or - 50% of the cost of living increase in the preceding calendar year or 6%, whichever is less, if the recipient is at least age 60 on July 1, or under age 60 if the recipient has been receiving TRS benefits for at least 8 years as of July 1. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) If you reside in Alaska after you retire, you may receive COLA in addition to your regular monthly benefit. COLA is equal to 10% of your base benefit. \"Residing in Alaska\" means domiciled and physically present in Alaska. A domicile is that place where you have your true, fixed and permanent home and principal establishment and to which, whenever absent, you intend to return. An absence which exceeds 90 days constitutes a break in residency for COLA purposes. The following are eligible to receive COLA: - Members who were first hired under the TRS before July 1, 1990, and their survivors; - members who were hired under the TRS after June 30, 1990, and their survivors if they are at least age 65; and - all disabled members. [Learn More](/retiree/planning.html#65) Yes, if you return to Alaska in less than 91 days. Absences greater than 90 days will result in the removal of COLA beginning the month following your departure for the entire absence. COLA will be reinstated the first of the month following your return and receipt of your application requesting reinstatement. If your absence is required because of illness, you may be out for up to 6 months, however, your absence must be necessary and certified by your physician.

You can also access your account balance by visiting the [myRnB website](//myrnb.alaska.gov/myrnb/faces/home;jsessionid=8GIfPGRU1byCG8fmcFkPvdg7vsNtnS9jIXOBDhNUBtDtuUeS3Emz!1036296521!-1816344256?_afrLoop=58080577423169404&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=Kevin%20Worley&_adf.ctrl-state=pweordapf_1#!%40%40%3F_afrWindowId%3DKevin%2BWorley%26_afrLoop%3D58080577423169404%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dpweordapf_5). Administrative regulations do not allow us to release information regarding personal or financial data to anyone other than the member without the member's prior written authorization unless the inquiring party has a subpoena or a court order to secure the information. We are allowed to release the information to the member's employer, former employer, or other authorized state agency. A member's spouse or legal counsel is NOT entitled to the member's information without a properly executed release. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Highly compensated employees may become subject to the salary limitations under IRS 401(a)(17) if they earn more than the maximum allowed salary for the year. If salaries exceed the limit ($265,000 for 2015) contributions will cease to be taken from their salaries until the start of the next tax year. Any contributions taken in error will be refunded, with interest, to the member and will represent taxable income. Members receiving a refund of contributions under this provision will receive a 1099 at the end of the tax year. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) No! Your account balance is not available to you until you are terminated from employment. Layoff or leave without pay status is not termination for purposes of obtaining a refund. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) You always have the option of leaving the money in your account. If you are a vested member intending to retire in the future, or are a non-vested member and intend to become reemployed in a covered position in the future, it may be wise to do so. Warning: If you refund your contributions and do not return to TRS-covered employment before July 1, 2010, you will forfeit the service and your tier. If you return to TRS-covered employment on or after July 1, 2010, you will be enrolled in the PERS/TRS DCR Plan. If you refund your account, you become a former member and forfeit any rights you had as a member. If you refund your account, you must take a full refund. You cannot obtain a partial refund. If you are non-vested (less than eight paid years of service) or single, completing the form is sufficient. If you are a married member, your spouse must consent to the refund on a form provided by the Retirement and Benefits Division. This form must be notarized. If the rights to your refund are subject to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO), you must also provide the notarized consent of each person entitled under the order. Complete the [Refund Election Form (gen008)](/docs/forms/gen008.pdf) form to obtain a refund of your contribution account balance.

[Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) First, the Division of Retirement and Benefits and the State of Alaska do not provide tax advice. Each member's tax situation is unique and you must consider the effect on your individual taxes. You should consult with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and a consultant as you deem necessary. Contributions placed in the TRS before January 1, 1991, are \"post-tax\" contributions. The contributions have already been taxed and you should owe no further tax on them. The interest earnings from these periods are still subject to income taxes. Both interest and contributions taken as a lump sum refund are subject to a penalty for early withdrawal. Contributions and interest placed in the TRS on or after January 1, 1991, are \"pre-tax\" contributions. These contributions have not been taxed previously. Therefore, both the contributions and interest earned on these amounts are subject to income tax. In January following the year in which a refund is made, members will receive a 1099R informational return which indicates the amount of the taxable and nontaxable portions. For the \"pretax\" contributions, if you choose to have the refund sent directly to you at your address or to your regular account at a banking institution, the IRS requires that we withhold 20% of the taxable portion of your refund, even if you later choose to do a \"rollover\" within the 60 day rollover period. You may also be subject to an additional early withdrawal penalty if you receive the refund before age 59\u00bd. You can avoid the withholding tax on the portion of your refund that you have us \"Direct Transfer\" to another qualified plan that accepts your transfer, such as an IRA. Only the taxable portion of your refund can be transferred. If your refund includes money that has already been taxed, we will refund that portion directly to you without withholding any taxes on it. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) You must arrange for another qualified plan, such as an Individual Retirement Arrangement / Account (IRA), to accept a direct transfer of your taxable contribution account balance. Once you have arranged for an institution to accept this transfer, you would complete a Notification of Termination/Refund Application form filling in the appropriate information. Be sure to include the plan name, address, plan contact person, and your account number. Complete the [Refund Election form (gen008)](/docs/forms/gen008.pdf) form to obtain a refund of your contribution account balance. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Generally, except for a few exceptions, employee contributions and other amounts held in the system are exempt from levy to enforce the collection of a debt, and are not subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or charge of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, without first being received by the person entitled to the amount under the terms of the system. The exceptions primarily include unpaid state, local, or federal taxes, a Child Support Enforcement Order for unpaid child support, and up to one month's unpaid earnings of an individual employed by a member. In addition, a member's right to receive benefits may be assigned by a Qualified Domestic Relations Order as a result of a divorce or dissolution. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Until an employee terminates employment or is appointed to retirement, the employee has no right to receive his regular contribution account balance, and therefore, it cannot be distributed at that time. However, while we will not distribute your account balance, we will place a hold on your account. A valid attachment, still in effect when the employee terminates, or is appointed to retirement, will be honored at that time. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Yes! If we are forced to honor a valid attachment, a member becomes a former member and loses any rights he or she may have had as a member. Even if the attachment is for a portion of your account balance, we would be forced to refund the balance to you, since there can be no partial refunds from the system. In this instance, an involuntary refund, plus any accumulated accrued interest, may be repaid to the system to reinstate your service without becoming reemployed in a system covered position. However, if the original attachment is still in effect, any repayments will be forwarded to the appropriate agency to satisfy any amount still due. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) The Division of Retirement and Benefits takes a critical view of what constitutes an emergency. For any emergency consideration, you must request a waiver in writing, and provide sufficient proof of your emergency. If you have other extenuating circumstances that you feel warrant consideration, you must provide a written detailed description to us along with your request for a waiver. If a waiver is granted in that case, a refund will be processed as soon as your employer has transmitted all of the contributions that were withheld from your pay (generally at least 30 days). Please Note: You must be terminated from employment to be eligible for any refund of TRS contributions. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) If you hire before July 1, 2010, yes. You may reinstate previously refunded service by repaying your refund amount and any interest that has accrued as required by law. Refunded service does not count toward vesting or retirement eligibility unless the indebtedness is paid in full. If you hire on or after July 1, 2010, no. You will forfeit your refunded service and tier and will be enrolled in the PERS/TRS DCR Plan. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) After receiving verification that your indebtedness has been established, you may make payments on your indebtedness directly to the Division of Retirement and Benefits either in full or with periodic payments over time. If you intend a payment to pay off your indebtedness balance, you should contact us for the balance. You may also establish a monthly payroll deduction through your employer. We can estimate when your indebtedness would be paid in full based on the amount of deduction you set up. If you have not received verification that your indebtedness has been established, contact us. Interest on your indebtedness will continue to accrue until your indebtedness is paid in full. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) The interest rate for the TRS is 7 percent, and it is compounded annually. Interest on an indebtedness is posted monthly (see question below regarding interest posting). [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) If you have not completely paid your indebtedness by the time you retire, your monthly benefits will be actuarially reduced over your lifetime, unless the reduction causes your benefit to be less than what it would have been without the service related to your indebtedness. If that is the case, your indebtedness payments would be refunded to you. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Interest posts to an account during the last monthly processing cycle during the last week of the month. Your indebtedness payments must be received by the cutoff for input to that processing. Please call the Division for cutoff times. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) No. Non-vested members whose employer has elected to participate in the conversion option may choose to transfer to the new plan. The decision to elect to convert to the new plan is solely the eligible employee's choice. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) The window period for election begins on the date the resolution to participate is approved by the TRS Administrator and ends 12 months later or when the member vests, whichever occurs first. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) Yes and No. Since you are not an active employee with your former employer, you do not have the option to convert to the new plan. However, if you reemploy with your former employer before you vest and before the 12 month conversion period ends, you may elect conversion. [Learn More](/employee/dbrplan.html) No. Only the employer you are currently working for must agree to participate in the conversion option. Your current employer is responsible for matching the balance of your employee contribution account up to the allowable limits of the IRC Sec. 415(c) regardless of which TRS employer you may have earned service with in the past.

Yes, because this is the only record we have of ensuring that death or survivor benefits are paid in accordance with your wishes. If you are married at the time of your death and you were married to the same person during part of your TRS employment, your spouse is automatically your beneficiary, regardless of your written designation, unless: - your spouse consents to another beneficiary on the [Retiree Beneficiary Designation (gen053)](/docs/forms/gen053.pdf)form. However, your spouse's consent to name another beneficiary is not required if the member was married for less than 2 years at the time of his or her death and the member and spouse were not living together when the designation was changed; or - another person (such as a former spouse) is eligible for the benefits under a [qualified domestic relations order (QDRO)](/docs/packets/qdro-packet.pdf). That person would be entitled to the portion of the benefit that is ordered by the QDRO. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html) Yes, if you qualify. To qualify for disability, you must have been in a TRS position for 5 years, for which no indebtedness is owing, and be unable to perform the usual duties of your job, or the duties of another job that an employer makes available for which you are qualified by training or education. While disabled, you will receive monthly benefits equal to 50% of your annual base salary immediately before becoming disabled (divided by 12 months). You will receive an additional 10% for each of your dependent children, if any, up to a maximum of four children. [Learn More](/employee/lifedisability.html) Account Information Your account balance, as well as your account activity, is included in your quarterly statement.

[Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) You are not required to remove your funds from the plan once you terminate employment. You may continue managing your account until a future date of your choosing. If you elect to withdraw your account, you may choose between several options. You may elect: - to rollover the amount to another qualified plan without tax consequences; or - choose a lump sum payout (See \"Taxes and Penalties\" section); or - a monthly annuity for a defined period (5, 10 or 15 years); or - a monthly annuity for your lifetime; or - a joint and survivor lifetime annuity. [Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) First, you must be terminated from employment. Then, you must submit an application for payment on the PERS/TRS DCR Distribution Request form. On the form, you can choose to be paid now or to defer payment to a future date. The date of payment depends on when the Distribution Request is received. Generally, lump-sum payments are paid within 65 to 80 days after termination. Continuing annuity payments usually begin on the first day of the month following the month in which your 60-day waiting period ends. [Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) If you are age 65 or greater and terminate employment you need to submit a [Distribution Request form](/docs/) to defer payment to a later date, not later than April 1 of the year following the year in which you turn 70-1/2 years of age. If you are under age 65, you do not need to submit a Distribution Request form until you are ready to begin receiving payments. [Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) Your PERS/TRS DCR plan account is considered marital property subject to equitable division in the event of a divorce or dissolution. Contributions and earning you have accumulated during your marriage are considered to be one-half the property of your spouse. When you choose any option other than the 50% or 100% joint and survivor option with your spouse as a survivor, your spouse must consent to this choice by signing a Distribution Request form. [Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) Yes. Because the contributions and earning you have accumulated during your marriage are considered to be one-half the property of your spouse, the plan cannot pay you the funds until the status of your spouse's entitlement is clear. You are required to submit a court-certified copy of the divorce decree or dissolution to the plan for review. If you have been released through the divorce or dissolution, a review of the property settlement will indicate the status of your ex-spouse's share of your account. If your ex-spouse has retained ownership of his or her share after the divorce or dissolution, the plan requires a domestic relations order (DRO) issued by the court be filed prior to any payments being made from your account. Plan staff will review the DRO to determine if it meets the requirements set out by the statutes governing the plan. If it does, it will then be qualified and the plan will implement the order. [Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) Depending on the payout form you select, you may be required to provide proof of birth date for yourself as well as your designated spouse and a copy of your marriage certificate. A birth certificate, baptismal record, military discharge, Alaska driver's license, or a passport are acceptable forms of proof of birth. [Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) Yes, if you have been separated from employment. [Learn More](/employee/leave.html) Beneficiaries A beneficiary designation is a form on which you indicate who is to receive any benefits you may be entitled to from the PERS/TRS DCR Plan should you die before drawing your benefits out of the plan. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html) If you wish to elect another person as your primary beneficiary (50% or greater), your spouse must provide written consent on the PERS/TRS DCR Plan Beneficiary Designation for Active and Deferred Participants form. Consent is not required if you were married for less than one year and you and your spouse were not living together when the designation was changed. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html) Yes. Since a divorce, dissolution or annulment voids any prior beneficiary designations you have made, you must file a new beneficiary designation after the divorce, dissolution, or annulment specifically affirming in writing that your former spouse is the primary beneficiary. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html) If your account exceeds $5,000, the plan must make the payment to an adult member of the minor's family who is a court-appointed guardian, a person having custody and care of the minor or a financial institution with a federally insured savings account in the sole name of the minor. A conservatorship must be established for the minor before payments can be made. If your account is less than $5,000, the plan may make payments without a conservatorship to the court-appointed guardian or person having custody and care of the minor or a financial institution with a federally insured savings account in the sole name of the minor. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html#dcrplan) When you fail to designate a beneficiary or, if no designated beneficiary survives you, the death benefit will be paid according to statute in the following order: - First to your surviving spouse. If there is no surviving spouse; - second to your surviving children in equal parts. If there are no surviving children; - third to your surviving parents in equal parts or, if there are no surviving parents; - fourth to your estate. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html#dcrplan) Yes. When an estate or trust is the beneficiary, a copy of the court document naming the personal representative of the estate or trustee of the trust must be filed with the plan along with the beneficiary designation form. The estate or trust must have an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the federal government before payment may be made. [Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) There is no limit to the number of times you can change who is to receive your benefits in the event of your death. The last beneficiary designation on file is the one the plan will use to determine who should receive your benefits. Please be sure to keep your beneficiary's contact information up-to-date or to change your beneficiary if you have a change in marital status. [Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) Contributions For PERS members, your employer contributes 5% of your gross eligible PERS salary to your account. For TRS members, your employer contributes 7% of your gross eligible TRS salary to your account. [Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) Both PERS and TRS members contribute 8% of gross eligible salary to the defined contribution account. [Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) No. The PERS/TRS DCR Plan does not allow additional voluntary contributions. [Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) Death and Disability Benefits To qualify as an occupational death, the proximate cause of death must be a bodily injury sustained or a hazard undergone while in the performance and within the scope you're your duties and not be the result of negligence on your part. A copy of your death certificate showing cause of death is usually sufficient to show your death was caused by an occupational injury or accident while you were conducting the usual duties of your job. To establish an occupational cause for illness may require additional medical documentation confirming causation. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html#dcrplan) Beneficiaries are only eligible to receive the balance of your retirement account, including gains and losses, less expenses. A surviving spouse is eligible to receive a monthly survivor benefit of 40% of your monthly gross compensation at the time of your death or 50% of your monthly gross compensation if you are a peace officer/firefighter member until the time you would have reached eligibility for normal retirement. Your employer will also continue to make monthly contributions based on your salary at the time of your death to a survivor account established for your surviving spouse in the occupational death fund. At normal retirement, your survivor may withdraw the balance of this account, including gains and losses, less expenses. This fund is invested by the plan fund managers while the survivor benefit is being paid. While your surviving spouse is receiving monthly survivor benefits, he or she may not withdraw your DCR retirement account balance. However, your surviving spouse will be able to direct the investment of the account among the ten available options. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html#dcrplan) A consulting physician will review your medical documentation and make a recommendation to the PERS/TRS DCR plan Administrator. The Administrator will then review your file and the consulting physician's recommendation to determine if you qualify for a disability retirement benefit. If you are approved for a benefit, you will be notified by phone, followed up by a letter. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html#dcrplan) If the Administrator determines you do not qualify for a disability retirement benefit, you may appeal the decision to the Office of Administrative Hearings within 30 days of notification of the denial for benefits. You may also submit additional medical evidence to the Administrator for review. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html#dcrplan) No, you do not need to terminate employment before applying for a disability benefit. However, if your disability benefit is approved, you must terminate within 30 days of the Administrator's decision. Your termination of employment must be due to the medical condition causing your disability. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html#dcrplan) You contact the Division of Retirement and Benefits for an application packet. You will receive a booklet that gives you step-by-step information on how to apply and what types of documentation must be submitted. You must submit your application to the division within 90 days after termination of employment if you have already terminated. Remember, you do not have to terminate before you can apply. If you miss the 90-day deadline, please contact the division for assistance. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html#dcrplan) In general, disability applications take six to eight weeks to process. It can take longer if you do not provide adequate medical documentation or other required information to support your application. It is your responsibility to provide complete information to the division so a determination can be made. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html#dcrplan) No. Coverage under the retiree medical plan is not available to any participants before eligibility for normal retirement. However, medical coverage can be provided for a limited period by using the federal COBRA entitlement to purchase continuing coverage from your employer health plan as a person losing coverage. Coverage for your disabling condition may be provided by Workers' Compensation. You will be eligible to enroll in the retiree medical plan when you reach normal retirement eligibility. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html#dcrplan) Disability benefits are intended to provide a means of economic survival if you must terminate your employment because of a total and presumably permanent disability. The program is not intended to supplement your income if you should recover from your disability and are able to return to work. If you return to work, you should contact the division immediately. [Learn More](/retiree/survivor.html#dcrplan) Disbursement You are eligible to receive payment of your account 60 days after you have been terminated from employment. If you are rehired before the 60-day period has passed, the withdrawal request will be canceled and a new 60-day period will begin at the next termination. This 60-day period is established in the Alaska Statutes. The only exception is a qualified hardship (see question 50). Actual payment mailing occurs after you have been terminated 60 days. [Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) Yes, if you have been separated from service. [Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) No. Money previously withdrawn cannot be re-deposited into your account.

On the form, you can choose to be paid now or to defer payment to a future date. The date of payment depends on when the Distribution Request is received. Generally, lump-sum payments are paid within 65 to 80 days after termination. Continuing annuity payments usually begin on the first day of the month following the month in which your 60-day waiting period ends. [Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) If you do not wish to take a distribution from your Defined Contribution retirement account, you do not have to until the IRS Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) begins. You must take your first RMD for the year in which you turn age 72. However, the first payment can be delayed until April 1 of the year after you reach the age of 72. For all subsequent years, including the year in which you were paid the first RMD by April 1, you must take the RMD by December 31 of the year. If you are still employed in PERS/TRS DCR beyond age 72, your RMD requirements will begin after you terminate PERS/TRS employment.) If an account owner fails to withdraw the RMD, fails to withdraw the full amount of the RMD, or fails to withdraw the RMD by the applicable deadline, the amount not withdrawn is taxed at 50%.

The regulation established for the annual posting of interest is 115 AAC 112.810 - Health Reimbursement Plan Rate Computation. The Division has until January 15 of the calendar year following the end of the fiscal year to post interest to an eligible member's account. Starting with Fiscal Year 2020's investment income / loss, the Division expects to post investment income / loss by November following a fiscal year. For example, investment income / loss for fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, we expect to be posted to eligible member accounts by November 2020. [Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) See the table below for the interest rate applied to eligible member account balances that the interest to be allocated to a member's eligible account is determined by several factors as outlined in 115 AAC 112.810 - Health Reimbursement Plan Rate Computation. [Learn More](/employee/dcrplan.html) The amount to be allocated to eligible accounts is determined by investment earnings (losses) of the fund, reinstatement costs (CPI adjustments), and the fund expenditures for the year. Before interest is posted, the Division must determine an amount to be transferred to the \"Expense and Reinstatement Reserve Account\" each year. The reserve account balance equals five times the fiscal year's expenditures and reinstatement costs (CPI costs for members who reinstated their account balance). After transfer to the \"Expense and Reinstatement Account\", the remaining investment income/loss balance is divided by the eligible member individual account balances as of June 30 to get an interest rate.

However, if you terminate, and select an annuity payment, the annuity payment you are receiving will not be affected by subsequent re-employment. Partial lump sum withdrawals will cease upon re-employment. Actual payment mailing occurs after you have been terminated 60 days and the Plan administrator approves your distribution. The only exception to payment eligibility earlier than 60 days after termination is for a qualified hardship. There are very strict criteria that must be met for a hardship distribution.

[Learn More](/employee/dcplan.html) Roth 457 Questions The Roth 457 option for governmental deferred compensation plans was authorized by Congress effective January 1, 2011. A Roth 457 is not a Roth IRA. Neither is a Roth 457 a separate plan; it is simply a way for employees to control the taxation of their deferred wages when they are disbursed in the future. This option allows employees to elect after tax salary deferrals into a Roth option. Roth elective deferrals are accounted for separately from the pre-tax contributions made to the plan. Distributions from the Roth 457 are tax free if the contributions have been in the Roth elective deferral account for at least 5 years and the participant is at least 59 \u00bd. [Learn More](/employee/dcplan.html#tax) For some employees, it might make sense to pay taxes on the DCP contributions now, rather than when money is withdrawn at retirement. Employees who would benefit are: - Employees who expect either their pay or tax rate to increase substantially over time. Being taxed at a lower rate today may be a better option. - Employees who expect to have relatively higher plan account investment earnings or to otherwise end up with a higher amount of money set aside for retirement, may benefit from paying taxes up front or just having a pool of tax-free money to draw on in the future. - Younger employees who have a longer retirement horizon and more time to accumulate tax-free earnings under a Roth 457. - Older employees who may want to leave tax-free money to their heirs in the future. - Employees may want the option of not taking required withdrawals at age 70 \u00bd by rolling their Roth 457 to a Roth IRA. The Roth 457 option gives employees more flexibility to save for retirement and provides control over when contributions, and retirement income, will be subject to federal income tax. [Learn More](/employee/dcplan.html#tax) Yes, but the Roth 457 contributions count towards the IRS limitations on deferred compensation contributions. Roth 457 contributions can either replace or complement traditional pre-tax contributions subject to the IRS limits of $18,000 per year (2015) plus an additional $6,000 in 2015 if the employee is age 50 or older at the end of the year. [Learn More](/employee/dcplan.html#tax) No. There can be no mixing of the two types of contributions. [Learn More](/employee/dcplan.html#tax) No. Contributions to a Roth 457 have no effect on contributions to a Roth IRA. [Learn More](/employee/dcplan.html#tax) No. Employees may invest Roth 457 contributions in any of the present fund options available in the Alaska Deferred Compensation Plan. [Learn More](/employee/dcplan.html#tax) No. The disbursement options remain the same for Roth 457 contributions. Earnings on the Roth 457 contributions will not be subject to taxation, however, if the employee is at least age 59 \u00bd and has held the Roth 457 account for 5 years or more. [Learn More](/employee/dcplan.html#tax) The 5-year period of participation begins on the first day of your taxable year for which you first made designated Roth contributions to the plan. It ends when five consecutive taxable years have passed. [Learn More](/employee/dcplan.html#tax) An in-plan Roth rollover is a rollover from your pre-tax contributions in DCP to the post-tax Roth 457 option. At this time the plan does not allow for this type of rollover. [Learn More](/employee/dcplan.html#tax) No, there are no limits on your income in determining if you can make designated Roth 457 contributions. Of course, you have to have sufficient salary from which to make the deferral, and you are subject to the IRS limit on the amount of contributions per year. [Learn More](/employee/dcplan.html#tax) No, you cannot contribute to a governmental Roth 457 for your spouse. [Learn More](/employee/dcplan.html#tax) Yes, provided you are age 50 or older by the end of the year. [Learn More](/employee/dcplan.html#tax) No, the IRS does not allow this type of rollover.

[Find a Provider](/employee/healthplans.html#network) If your current provider is not listed as an in-network provider, you can ask your physician to contact AlaskaCare for a participation application. If you would like the provider to receive an application, please complete the [Provider Nomination form](http://doa.dev.alaska.gov/docs/forms/ProviderNominationForm.pdf) . When you use a network provider, you can take advantage of the significant discounts negotiated to help lower your out-of-pocket costs for medically necessary care. This can help you get the care you need at a lower price. [Learn More](/employee/healthplans.html#network) If you use an out-of-network provider, you are responsible for the difference between the recognized charge and the amount charged by the provider in addition to other applicable charges such as deductibles, co-payments, co-insurance and non-covered charges. [Learn More](/employee/healthplans.html#network) The AlaskaCare plans limit payment of covered services to the recognized charge. The recognized charge is the maximum amount the AlaskaCare plans will pay for a covered service. Aetna and Moda/Delta Dental, and their respective network providers (sometimes referred to as participating providers), agree to a set of discounted negotiated rates for services provided. The recognized charge for network providers is the negotiated rate. For an explanation of how the recognized charge is calculated for out-of-network providers, please see the recognized charge questions under the Network and Dental sections. An out-of-network provider has the right to bill you for the difference between the recognized charge and the actual charge. This is often referred to as balance billing. Network providers have agreed to accept, as payment in full, the negotiated charge. Therefore, you are not subject to balance billing when you use a network provider. [Learn More](/employee/healthplans.html#network) You may prevent balance billing by verifying all medical providers are in the Aetna network and making sure your AlaskaCare Plan covers the services you need. For example, if you're having x-rays, MRIs, CT scans, or PET scans, make sure both the imaging facility and the radiologist who will read your scan are in the network. Similarly, for AlaskaCare covered dental services, you may prevent balance billing by verifying the provider is in the Moda/Delta Dental network. [Learn More](/employee/healthplans.html#network) If your provider is not a network provider, you may ask for an estimate of charges, the codes that will be used use for billing, and the provider's zip code. When you receive this information, contact the Aetna Concierge at [(855) 784-8646](tel:855-784-8646) or Moda/Delta Dental at [(855) 718-1768](tel:855-718-1768). A member of the Aetna Concierge or Moda Customer Service team can review the estimated charges and will advise you if the charges fall within the recognized charge for your area. If the estimated charges exceed the recognized charge, you may request that your provider accept that amount and not balance bill you, or you may request payment arrangements with their office. If your current provider is not listed as a network provider, you can ask your provider to contact Aetna at [(800) 720-4009](tel:800-720-4009) or Moda at [(855) 718-1768](tel:855-718-1768) for a participation application. Members are also encouraged to nominate their out-of-network providers to join the network. Contact the Aetna Concierge or Moda Customer Service to find out how. In some cases, unfortunately, there will not be a network provider for the service you need in your area. The Division, Aetna and Moda/Delta Dental are working diligently to improve network access, but please understand that we cannot force providers into the network. [Learn More](/employee/healthplans.html#network) Yes, there is a network of providers for durable medical equipment.

[Learn More](/employee/healthplans.html#network) Recognized Charge Recognized charge means the negotiated charge contained in an agreement the claims administrator has with the provider either directly or through a third party. If there is no such agreement, the recognized charge is determined in accordance with the provisions of this section. Except for charges related to involuntary out-of-network services, an out-of-network provider has the right to bill the difference between the recognized charge and the actual charge. This difference will be the covered person's responsibility. Medical Expenses: As to medical services or supplies, the recognized charge for each service or supply is the lesser of: - What the provider bills or submits for that service or supply; - Or the 90th percentile of the prevailing charge rate; for the geographic area where the service is furnished as determined by Aetna in accordance with Aetna reimbursement policies. [Find a Provider](/employee/healthplans.html#network) For more information on recognized charge in the Employee Plan, see the [AlaskaCare Insurance Information Booklet](/docs/booklets/AC-EmployeeHealthPlanBooklet_WEB.pdf) , section 3.3.7 Recognized Charge [Learn More](/employee/healthplans.html#network) Coordination of Benefits Coordination of Benefits (COB) is a method of ensuring that people covered by more than one medical plan will receive the benefits they are entitled to but not more than 100% of their covered expenses. The AlaskaCare health plans coordinate benefits with other group health care plans to which you or your covered dependents belong. Coordination of benefits can be very confusing, even for people who work at a physician's office. With COB, if you are covered by more than one health care plan, the plans work together to provide benefits. One plan is considered \"primary\" and pays your covered expenses first. The other plan is \"secondary\" and pays any remaining covered expenses up to 100%. In some cases, there may be a third or fourth plan, as well. It is important to remember that not all expenses are covered expenses. Most COB rules are set by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). Rules for coordinating with Medicare and Medicaid are set by federal and state law. Most plans follow the NAIC rules, but there is no requirement that they do so. The AlaskaCare health plans follow standard NAIC rules to ensure ease of coordination with other plans. Here are examples of common COB situations and rules: |If You Are Covered Under...||Here's How the Plans Pay| |Active employee plan and retiree plan||Primary: Active employee plan | Secondary: Retiree plan |Retiree plan and as dependent under another person's plan through active employment||Primary: Retiree plan | Secondary: Other person's plan |Retiree plan and Medicare-eligible||Primary: Medicare | Secondary: Retiree plan |Two retiree plans||Primary: Plan in force the longest | Secondary: Other plan |Retiree plan, as dependent under another person's plan through active employment, and Medicare-eligible||Primary: Other person's plan | Secondary: Medicare Third: Retiree plan |Active employee plan, retiree plan, as dependent under another person's plan through active employment, and Medicare-eligible||Primary: Active employee plan | Secondary: Other person's plan Third: Medicare Fourth: Retiree plan If your dependent children are covered under more than one plan, in most cases, the plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the year (not the oldest) is primary. If both parents have the same birthday, the plan that has covered the children longer is primary. If the parents are separated or divorced, here's how the plans pay: - Primary: Plan of the parent whom the court has established as financially responsible for the child's health care (the claims administrator must be informed of the court decree) - Secondary: Plan of the parent with custody of the child - Pays third: Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child - Pays fourth: Plan of the parent who does not have custody of the child If none of the above rules applies, the plan that has covered the patient the longest is primary. When an AlaskaCare plan is secondary, the amount the plan pays after the deductible is met is figured by subtracting the benefits payable by the other plan from 100% of expenses covered by the AlaskaCare plan on that claim. No, you may receive a balance bill if you use an out-of-network provider. In this case, the plan will pay up to the recognized charge for this service in your area. The AlaskaCare Employee Health Plan will only pay 30% of the covered charges for your dependents if your spouse, qualified same-sex partner or child(ren) are covered by a state employee health trust and that coverage: - Has been waived, - Pays less than 70% of covered expenses, or - Has an individual out-of-pocket maximum (including deductible) of more than $3,500. This applies to any dependent covered by the AlaskaCare Employee Health Plan whether the plan pays as primary or secondary. Example: - You incur covered expenses of $1,000. Your spouse elected limited coverage under a union health trust that pays 20% coinsurance, so your AlaskaCare Employee Health Plan will pay 30% after the deductible. - Spouse's plan amount: $500 ($1,000 - $500) Dental Plan Prophylaxis (cleaning) or periodontal maintenance is covered up to two times in any benefit year. Additional cleaning benefits may be available if medically necessary or dentally necessary and when precertified by Moda/Delta Dental. [Learn More](/employee/healthplans.html#dental) If you are diabetic or pregnant in your third trimester, the Oral Health, Total Health program offers more ways to care for your teeth and mouth. Diabetes increases the risk of cavities, periodontal (gum) disease, tooth loss, dry mouth and infection. If you have been diagnosed with this disease you are eligible for four prophylactic (preventive) cleanings or periodontal maintenance visits per year through our Oral Health, Total Health program. Protect your teeth and gums by enrolling today. Pregnant women who have periodontal (gum) disease are more likely to have a premature and underweight baby. Bacteria can enter the bloodstream through the mouth, and the body's response to the infection can trigger early labor. If you are expecting, you can enroll in the Oral Health, Total Health program to help prevent gum disease. If you've already had two cleanings for the year, you'll be eligible for another cleaning or checkup during your third trimester.This added preventive (prophylactic) visit is covered regardless of normal plan frequency limits.

Compounds will continue to be covered under the Defined Benefit Retiree Health plan. Coverage of compounds differs for the active employee and defined contribution retiree health plans. The AlaskaCare Employee Health Plan and AlaskaCare DCR Benefit Plan only cover compound drugs if: - the product contains at least one prescription ingredient; - the active ingredient(s) is approved by the FDA for medicinal use in the United States; - the product is not a copy of a commercially available FDA approved drug; and - the safety and effectiveness for the intended use is supported by FDA approval, or adequate medical and scientific evidence in the medical literature. Optum Rx maintains a National Compound Credentialing Program (NCCP) to ensure the best compounded medication quality and effectiveness for the patients who need personalized medications. You must fill your compounded medication prescription at a pharmacy which has been credentialed with the Optum Rx National Compound Credentialing Program (NCCP). Using an NCCP pharmacy ensures that you will not be charged up front for your prescription (and required to submit your own claim for reimbursement), you will not be charged for molding or other non-covered charges, and you will not be charged for shipping if the pharmacy mails your compounded medication to you. You can find a list of NCCP-credentialed pharmacies here. You can also call Optum Rx at [(855) 409-6999](tel:8554096999) (TTY 711) to get help locating NCCP-credentialed pharmacies. [Learn More](/employee/healthplans.html#pharmacy) AlaskaCare eligible employees who have LWOP will continue to have health insurance coverage if they continue to pay their monthly premiums (through payroll deduction or self-pay). If your paycheck will be sufficient to cover your health premiums (because you worked part of the pay period or you have personal leave available), you do not need to do anything. If you anticipate that your paycheck will not cover your health premiums, you need to contact the Division of Retirement and Benefits at [(907) 465-4460](tel:9074654460) to coordinate payments. If you are self-paying premiums, you can send checks to: Division of Retirement and Benefits/Health Section P.O. Box 110203 Juneau, AK. 99811-0203 If you do not pay your premiums within 30 days after the last premiums were received, your coverage will be retroactively terminated effective the last day of the last month in which premiums were received. Any insurance claims you may have will be reprocessed. If more than 30 days have elapsed, contact the Division to discuss your options. Example: If pay period December 1-15 is paid on December 31, and no health premiums were taken due to insufficient funds, the Division will attempt to recover the missed premiums automatically in the pay period December 16-31, paid on January 15. In the even that there are insufficient funds again, the employee would need to arrange payment by January 31. If you have leave without pay (except for a leave taken as a result of injury or illness) during your first 30 days of employment, you are covered after you return to work and are in pay status for 31 consecutive days. [AlaskaCare Employee Insurance Information Booklet, Section 1.7.1](/docs/booklets/AC-EmployeeHealthPlanBooklet_WEB.pdf#page=19) . The HRA is a tax-free medical reimbursement plan funded by the employer for members enrolled in the Consumer Choice plan. The balance of the HRA is applied towards the Consumer Choice deductible each benefit year until the HRA balance is exhausted. Unused HRA money can be rolled over to be applied towards the next benefit year deductible. Participants in the Consumer Choice plan will receive a HRA contribution from the state in the amount of $750.00 annually for a single employee, or $1,500.00 for a family. As long as you are enrolled in the Consumer Choice plan with the state, any unused HRA funds can rollover from year to year, for a maximum of up two years (prior benefit year and the current benefit year). Once you are no longer enrolled in the Consumer Choice plan any remaining balance in your HRA will be forfeited. For eligible employees enrolled in the consumer choice plan, the third-party administrator will automatically apply your available HRA balance towards your annual deductible for covered medical expenses. For more information, refer to the [active employee plan booklet, section 7.2](/docs/booklets/AC-EmployeeHealthPlanBooklet_WEB.pdf) . The family HRA account balance of $1500.00, will be applied towards the deductible before any family member must pay. No. The Consumer Choice Health Plan does not meet the Internal Revenue Code standards for a High Deductible Health Plan, and it does not have a Health Savings Account (H.S.A.) option. Instead, the Consumer Choice Health Plan has an embedded Health Reimbursement Account (HRA), fully funded by the state, applied to the deductible, to help reduce member costs. No, not when in-network providers are use. The health plan covers eligible preventive services at 100% when received at a network provider, so it's important to make sure you are using a network provider. This means you will you have no out-of-pocket costs (no co-insurance or deductible) for eligible preventive services, including checkups and age-appropriate preventive testing (such as routine blood tests, mammograms or colonoscopies). See the [Preventive Care Coverage Information Flyer](/docs/flyers/preventiveCareServices.pdf) and the [Women's Preventive Care Coverage Information Flyer](/docs/flyers/womansPreventive.pdf) for additional information. Yes, the HRA is integrated with the Consumer Choice plan to help offset your annual deductible. No. IRS regulations do not allow an employee to contribute to an HRA. Only the employer can contribute to your HRA. Yes. Unused funds from a current year can rollover to the next benefit year if you remain enrolled in the Consumer Choice plan. HRA funds rollover is limited to a maximum of two years, this means that the maximum balance a single employee can have at any time is $1,500. Once you are no longer enrolled in the Consumer Choice plan, any remaining HRA funds will be forfeited. You can keep track of your account balance by keeping track of your medical claims. You can also get a copy of your claims history from Aetna. Any funds left in your HRA when you terminate employment or retire are forfeited. Active employees who elect COBRA have the option of continued enrollment in the Consumer Choice plan with HRA. Remaining HRA funds will remain available if you elect COBRA after leaving state employment. You should contact your health plan administrator for more information on COBRA. Yes. A HRA can work in conjunction with a HFSA, but you can't be reimbursed from your HFSA for expenses already covered by the HRA. New employees will be entitled to the same HRA contribution at any time during the plan year. HRA contributions will not be pro-rated.

You may share one copy of your ID card with your spouse, however, you or your dependents only need to present one of these ID cards to the pharmacy. Optum Rx coordinates your coverage behind the scenes. - Both my spouse and I are are retirees and eligible for Medicare: If you are both eligible for Medicare and are enrolled in the enhanced Employer Group Waiver Program (EGWP), you should each receive a single ID card that has the MedicareRx logo in the lower right (see example below). Each card will have an individual name and ID number. Although you receive only one card, when you present the card at the pharmacy you will receive the benefit of your double coverage under the plan. This means you will not be required to pay a copay at the pharmacy counter. - One of us is a Medicare-eligible retiree enrolled in the enhanced Employer Group Waiver Program (EGWP) and the other is either an active employee or a retiree not enrolled in EGWP: The retiree who is Medicare-eligible and is enrolled in the enhanced Employer Group Waiver Program (EGWP) will receive a single ID card that has the MedicareRx logo in the lower right (see example below). The card will have their individual name and ID number. Although they receive only one card, when they present the card at the pharmacy, they will receive the benefit of having double coverage under the plan. This means they will not be required to pay a copay at the pharmacy counter. The spouse who is not enrolled in the EGWP will receive an ID card two-pack in their own name for each layer of coverage they have (their own coverage and their dependent coverage as the spouse of a Medicare-eligible retiree). The only difference between the two packs of ID cards will be the ID number. The ID number that matches the Medicare-eligible retiree's MedicareRx ID card will be the dependent coverage card. - Both my spouse and I are either an active employee or a retiree not yet eligible for Medicare: - I am covered under more than one of my own AlaskaCare plans, and... - I am eligible for Medicare: If you are eligible for Medicare and are enrolled in the enhanced Employer Group Waiver Program (EGWP), you should receive a single ID card that has the MedicareRx logo in the lower right (see example below). Although you receive only one card, when you present the card at the pharmacy you will receive the benefit of your double coverage under the plan. This means you will not be required to pay a copay at the pharmacy counter. - I am not eligible for Medicare: You will receive an ID card two-pack for each layer of coverage you have. The only difference between the different packs of ID cards will be the ID number. However, you only need to present one of these ID cards to the pharmacy. Optum Rx coordinates the coverage behind the scenes. - I am eligible for Medicare: Sample card: [Learn More](/employee/healthplans.html#pharmacy) Optum Rx coordinates all the layers of coverage for you and your dependents behind the scenes, so in many cases you and your dependents can use each other's cards at the pharmacy. However, a non-EGWP dependent should not use the card that has a MedicareRx logo in the lower right corner. This card would only work if the pharmacist uses the correct person code (to identify them as a dependent rather than the policy holder). To avoid any confusion at the pharmacy, we recommend you and your dependents only use a card that has your name on it.

Under the individual shared responsibility provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), individuals must indicate their enrolled dependents, as well as themselves, have had a full year of qualifying health care coverage (called minimum essential coverage), qualify for an exemption, or pay a penalty when filing their income taxes. By providing your dependent social security numbers, we can report proof of minimum essential health care coverage to help you avoid the hassle of having to prove to the IRS that your dependents had coverage.

Audio services pay a maximum benefit of $3,000 in a rolling 36-month period. A hearing aid (monaural or binaural) is a covered service if prescribed as a result of an otological (ear) or audiological (hearing) examination. This includes ear mold(s), hearing aid instrument, initial batteries, cords, and other necessary supplementary equipment as well as warranty, and follow-up consultation within 30 days following delivery of the hearing aid. [Learn More](/events/openenrollment.html) The plan meets the criteria under [Internal Revenue Code \u00a7125](//www.irs.gov/government-entities/federal-state-local-governments/faqs-for-government-entities-regarding-cafeteria-plans) and its accompanying Treasury Regulations, which govern cafeteria plans as offered under the Select Benefits Health Plan. This allows for premiums that are taken from your paycheck to be deducted prior to taxes being calculated. [Learn More](/events/openenrollment.html) Voluntary Supplemental Benefits There no premium changes to the Voluntary Supplemental Benefits (VSB) plan for , but there were some enhancements made to the Critical Illness Plan. 10 new \"progressive diseases\" were added, coverage for COVID-19 was added, the maximum lifetime benefit was removed, and the pre-existing condition limitation was removed. We are continuously looking for ways to improve and expand benefits to employees, so check back next year for more updates. All employees can enroll, except: - members of the bargaining unit Labor, Trades and Crafts (LTC) - members of the Teachers' Retirement System (TRS) - on-call Employees - employees of the National Guard (including Emergency Guard) - short-term non-permanent employees - student interns - leased employees - emergency employees hired for natural disasters, including emergency fire fighters - temporary legislative employees - Life Insurance - Accidental Death and Dismemberment - Short-Term Disability - Long-Term Disability - Critical Illness Yes and no. Premiums for coverage other than life insurance are taken on a pre-tax basis. For the life insurance products, premiums up to $50,000 in total pre-tax or employer paid life insurance, including State-provided Basic Life Insurance are not taxed. Premiums attributable to pre-tax or employer paid life insurance amounts over $50,000 are taxable, will show as imputed income on your pay, and will be taxed. Imputed income is the addition of the value of non-cash compensation to an employee's taxable wages in order to properly withhold income taxes from the wages. Premiums for the Critical Illness plan and Select Life are post-tax and will not result in imputed income. No. Your current elections will automatically roll over to the next benefit year if you do not participate in Open Enrollment. Occasionally we need to make changes to benefits or administrators that require members to participate in Open Enrollment or a Special Enrollment in order to keep/select benefits. We will always notify members if you are required to make an election. If you were approved by for life insurance in the amount of $200,000 or $300,000, your approval will continue. However, if you apply for either $200,000 or $300,000 of coverage for the first time during Open Enrollment, you will be required to provide a Statement of Health (SOH) to MetLife. Statement of Health (SOH) Proof of good health, evidenced by a SOH, is a standard part of the application process to elect higher volumes of life insurance. A SOH is a document that includes a series of questions about your overall health, and is sometimes referred to as Medical Evidence of Insurability (MEOI or EOI). Statements of health are used to protect an employer's group insurance program from adverse risks and to reduce the likelihood of disproportional claims risk. This helps control the cost of the group insurance program and allows the employer to continue offering the coverage. Active employees electing life insurance levels at $200,000 or $300,000 will be required to provide an SOH: - when electing coverage during open enrollment; - when increasing coverage due to qualifying life events; or - when electing coverage at initial hire. For questions regarding the SOH process or what may result in a denial of coverage, please contact the insurer, MetLife, directly at [(800) 638-6420](tel:800-638-6420). No. Elections of life insurance at these levels do not require proof of good health. As long as you don't change your level of coverage, you will not be required to submit a new SOH form every year. If you elect to increase or decrease your coverage to either $200,000 or $300,000 after a qualified status change or at a subsequent open enrollment, you will have to provide SOH again. If you decrease coverage below $200,000 in the future, no SOH is required. If you elect $200,000 or $300,000 in life insurance you are covered at $100,000 until you are approved. For example, if you apply for $300,000, and you pass away before you are approved for $300,000 your beneficiaries will receive $100,000. If you are not approved for $200,000 or $300,000 your coverage will automatically default to $100,000. During the enrollment process or Open Enrollment, you will be prompted automatically to complete the Statement of Health if you choose the level of life insurance coverage that requires the SOH. Enrollment is through MetLife's partner, [BenefitFocus](//secure3-enroll.com/go/bfi) .

The AlaskaCare Employee Health Plan is offering a new lower-premium medical plan option this year with a higher deductible than medical plans traditionally offered by AlaskaCare. The new Consumer Choice plan is a consumer driven health plan with an employer sponsored Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA). There are several things you can do to ensure you get the most value from your plan. Using \"network\" providers can provide substantial benefits to members through the elimination of what's known as \"balance billing.\" It can also generate substantial savings to members through negotiated provider discounts. To find out whether your doctor is a member of the Aetna network, call Aetna's Health Concierge at [(855) 784-8646](tel:8557848646) or visit the [Find a Doctor page](//www.aetna.com/dsepublic/#/contentPage?page=providerSearchLanding&site_id=alaskacare) . Get recommended preventive checkups, screenings, vaccines, prenatal care, and contraceptives. You won't have to pay out-of-pocket for these preventive visits, when provided in network, and getting regular exams and screenings will help you live healthier. For a list of covered preventative services visit the [Preventative Care Coverage Information Flyer](/docs/flyers/preventivecareservices.pdf) and the [Women's Preventive Care Coverage Information Flyer](/docs/flyers/womanspreventive.pdf) . Use generic drugs when available. Generic drugs offer you a safe and effective alternative to brand name drugs - but at a lesser cost. Choosing a lower tiered drug when it is appropriate can provide access to the necessary medications to stay healthy, at a cost that is more affordable. The State of Alaska is required to send IRS Form 1095-C to any employee who was offered coverage or enrolled in AlaskaCare or a union trust health insurance plan. If you were eligible for health benefits at any point in the year, then you should receive a 1095-C, which contains detailed information about the health care coverage you were provided or offered by the State of Alaska. It is important to keep the form for your records. Form 1095-B is an IRS form that reports dependents covered by your union health trust. It also contains similar information to the 1095-C issued by the State of Alaska, including the type of coverage you and your dependents had and the dates you and your dependents were covered in the prior year. You received the 1095 form(s) because you were eligible for or were offered employee health benefits in . The IRS will use the information reported on the forms to determine whether a penalty tax is to be assessed. The forms will also be used to determine whether you are eligible for premium tax credits if you purchase coverage on the public insurance marketplace. A full-time employee who works for more than one employer must receive a separate Form 1095-C from each employer. If you had outside employment, you may receive a 1095-C from both the State of Alaska and your other employer. If you are covered under a union health trust, you will receive a Form 1095-C from the State of Alaska, and a Form 1095-B from your union health trust that reflects your covered dependents. Your 1095 for the tax year will be mailed on or before March 2, . If you believe you should have received a 1095-C but did not, please contact the Division of Personnel Employee Call Center at [(907) 465-3009](907-465-3009) or . If you are covered by a union health trust and believe you should have received a 1095-B but did not, please contact your health trust. There are three parts to the form: - Part 1 reports information about you and the State of Alaska. - Part 2 reports information about the health benefit coverage offered or provided each month, the affordability of the coverage offered, and the reason why you were or were not offered coverage. - Part 3 identifies each covered individual, including spouses and dependents, and identifies the months of coverage. Part 3 may not include dependent information if you are covered by a union health trust. You should receive a separate 1095-B to report dependents covered under the trust. If you do not have health care coverage and do not qualify for an exemption, you may be subject to a fine when you file for your tax return. For more information on whether you may qualify for an exemption, visit [IRS.gov](//irs.gov/affordable-care-act/find-out-if-you-qualify-for-a-health-insurance-coverage-exemption) It is not necessary to wait for Forms 1095-B or 1095-C in order to file your taxes. For more questions and answers about health care information forms for individuals from the IRS, see their [FAQ page](//irs.gov/affordable-care-act/questions-and-answers-about-health-care-information-forms-for-individuals) . The 1095 forms are only received by the employee, or the \"responsible individual\" as referred to by the IRS. A copy of the form is not provided to the dependents. These forms report very similar information, and which form you receive will be dependent on who is responsible for issuing the 1095 form. - You will receive a 1095-C if you received health care coverage through your employer. - You will receive a 1095-B if you were covered by other insurers, such as a union health trust, self-funded retiree plan, or other small self- funded groups or employers. - You will receive a 1095-A if you were covered by a federal or state marketplace (also called an exchange.) Yes, self-insured group health plans for employees, COBRA coverage, and retiree coverage qualify as Minimum Essential Coverage. If you have additional questions about your 1095, please contact your tax consultant. Visit [Healthcare.gov](//healthcare.gov/) to learn more. The DCR plan to DB plan webpage will be updated on an ongoing basis and will be less frequent from week to week. You can find information on participating employers on the [Participating Employers / Payroll Processing Contacts](https://drb.alaska.gov/employer/paycontacts.html) page. Yes. The employee contributions and any net market gains or losses of the PERS or TRS DCR account balance will be transferred to pay the cost of conversion. If any PERS or TRS DCR employee balance remains after the outstanding conversion indebtedness balance(s) are paid, the remaining balance will be refunded to the member by Empower Retirement. Employer match contributions and any attributable gains and losses are not eligible to be utilized by the member to pay the cost of conversion. Employer contributions made on the member's behalf will be transferred to the defined benefit plan to fund the lifetime future benefit that the member will receive from the fund as well as the system paid medical benefits that the member may be eligible for in retirement. The reinstatement indebtedness (REI) consists of the total refund received plus accrued interest at the rate prescribed by regulation (7%) from the date of refund through June 30, 2010. No further interest will accrue from July 1, 2010, until the previously refunded service is reinstated. Interest will accrue at the rate prescribed by regulation (7%) from the date of conversion until the REI is paid in full or at the time of retirement. The cost of conversion represents the employee contributions which would have been made and accrued interest (4.5%) had you been a member of the PERS or TRS DB during the years you were enrolled in the PERS or TRS DCR. Interest will accrue on any unpaid balance from the date of conversion until the conversion indebtedness is paid in full or at the time of retirement. Yes, but you must first reemploy in a PERS or TRS eligible position. You will have 30 days from the date of hire to choose whether to convert. If you do not elect to reinstate your previously refunded DB service and return to your original tier status, you will default into the DCR plan. If you elect to reinstate your original tier status, your previous DCR PERS or TRS service must be converted to DB service and an indebtedness will be established on your record for the conversion cost. An indebtedness will also be established for your previously refunded DB service. Yes. Members will be able to make payments by pretax transfer, pretax payroll deductions or with post tax monies on any remaining unpaid cost of conversion or Reinstatement Indebtedness that may exist. Yes. Indebtedness is not a bill. If at the time of retirement, you elect to cancel any outstanding indebtedness due by accepting an actuarial reduction to your benefit for life, and the election reduces your benefit below what it would have been had the indebtedness not existed, then the claimed service and associated indebtedness will be removed from your final retirement benefit calculation. Yes. Yes. Yes. Remaining balances can be paid with pretax qualified accounts after conversion is complete, including State of Alaska Supplemental Annuity Plans (SBS) and Deferred Compensation Plans (DCP). Once you have been notified that the conversion is complete, you will need to submit a Purchase of Service by Pretax Transfer form to apply any additional pretax qualified payments towards your remaining indebtedness balance(s). Yes. No. Yes. The Division of Retirement and Benefits will provide members who convert a notification of pretax transfer payments applied and if there is any remaining indebtedness balance owed. The DRB will be processing all submissions to convert first in first out. DRB counseling representatives will be contacting the members to provide counseling on the process and costs associated with the conversion. Incorrect information provided by the member will cause a delay in this process. It may take four to eight weeks for a counselor to contact you after you have submitted the online submission form. Once you have submitted your online submission form, a member of the counseling team will contact you to set up a time to discuss the process and costs associated with conversion based on the order that forms are submitted. This means, if, as a result of service credit claimed (reinstatement indebtedness or conversion cost not paid in full in this case) for which there is an indebtedness existing at retirement, the benefit is actuarially reduced by a factor spreading the remaining indebtedness balance out over the anticipated lifetime of the benefit. If applying an actuarial reduction reduces your benefit below what it would have been had the claimed service and associated indebtedness not existed, then the claimed service and indebtedness will be removed from your final retirement benefit calculation. Service associated with a Reinstatement indebtedness (REI) or Conversion indebtedness that has an outstanding balance will not count towards vesting or service eligibility (i.e. 20 or 30 years). Yes. However, each form will need to be submitted according to the directions provided on the specific claim forms. The conversion needs to be completed first, then the military/outside claim will be processed after the conversion has been completed. A former member means an employee who is terminated and who has received a total refund of the balance of the employee contribution account, or who has requested in writing a refund of the balance in the employee contribution account. PERS DB members accrue interest on their individual accounts at 4.5% compounded semi-annually. TRS DB members accrue interest on their individual accounts at 4.5% compounded annually on June 30. For the former DB members who have reemployed and are now DCR members, the cost of conversion represents the employee contributions which would have been made including accrued interest (4.5%) had the employee been a member of the PERS or TRS DB plan during the years they were enrolled in the PERS or TRS DCR plan. Under the PERS DB plan, the prescribed rate of interest that accrues on any indebtedness amount is 7% compounded semi-annually on June 30 and December 31 of each year. Under the TRS DB plan, effective July 1, 1974, the interest rate on arrearage, retroactive and reinstatement contributions is 7% compounded annually on June 30. Once your form is received and approved by the Division, it can take up several months for the pretax transfer from Empower Retirement to be posted to your DB account. All conversion election forms submitted to the Division will be processed on a first in first out basis. Any incomplete forms will be returned to the member for correction and resubmission. Please contact [the Division](/contact/center.html) if you are in this situation.

The definition of retiree dependents limiting coverage to age 19 (or age 23 if a full-time student) comes directly from Alaska statute. Expanding dependent coverage to age 26 is one of the provisions in the Federal Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act (PPACA) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (HCERA) that became effective March 2010. This provision affects employee plans and retiree-only health plans differently. On June 14, 2010, the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury issued regulations on Grandfathered Health Plans under PPACA. In the preamble to the Interim Final Rule, the Secretaries clarify that it is not their intent to apply the PPACA coverage to retiree-only health plans. This means the retiree medical plan, is not subject to the expanded dependent coverage provisions of PPACA.

If there is no such agreement, the recognized charge is determined in accordance with the provisions of this section. Except for charges related to involuntary out-of-network services, an out-of-network provider has the right to bill the difference between the recognized charge and the actual charge. This difference will be the covered person's responsibility. Medical Expenses: As to medical services or supplies, the recognized charge for each service or supply is the lesser of: - What the provider bills or submits for that service or supply; - Or the 90th percentile of the prevailing charge rate; for the geographic area where the service is furnished as determined by Aetna in accordance with Aetna reimbursement policies. For more information on recognized charge in the Retiree Plan, see the [Retiree Insurance Information Booklet](/docs/booklets/DB-RetireeInsuranceBooklet_WEB.pdf) , section 3.1.4 Recognized Charge. Network Using \"network\" providers can provide substantial benefits to members through the elimination of what's known as \"balance billing.\" It can also generate substantial savings to members through negotiated provider discounts. To find a network provider: - Call Aetna's Health Concierge at [(855) 784-8646](tel:8557848646)or select the \"Find a Doctor\" button on our website, AlaskaCare.gov. - Call Moda/Delta Dental at [(855) 718-1768](tel:8557181768)or select the \"Find a Dentist\" button on our website - Call Optum Rx at [(855) 718-1768](tel:8557181768)or select the \"Find a Pharmacist\" button on our website. The AlaskaCare plans limit payment of covered services to the recognized charge. The recognized charge is the maximum amount the AlaskaCare plans will pay for a covered service. Aetna and Moda/Delta Dental, and their respective network providers (sometimes referred to as participating providers), agree to a set of discounted negotiated rates for services provided. The recognized charge for network providers is the negotiated rate. For an explanation of how the recognized charge is calculated for out-of-network providers, please see the recognized charge questions under the Network and Dental sections. An out-of-network provider has the right to bill you for the difference between the recognized charge and the actual charge. This is often referred to as balance billing. Network providers have agreed to accept, as payment in full, the negotiated charge. Therefore, you are not subject to balance billing when you use a network provider. You may find that not all providers at a \"network\" facility are part of the Aetna network. For example, if you have a surgical procedure performed at a network hospital, you may find that the hospital and surgeon are in the network, but the anesthesiologist is out-of-network. When you get your bill, you'll see that it reflects the negotiated network rates for your hospital and surgeon. The anesthesiologist, however, may charge what they choose since they have no negotiated contract with Aetna. If the anesthesiologist claim exceeds the recognized charge, you may receive a bill for the balance. You may prevent balance billing by verifying all medical providers are in the Aetna network and making sure your AlaskaCare Plan covers the services you need. For example, if you're having x-rays, MRIs, CT scans, or PET scans, make sure both the imaging facility and the radiologist who will read your scan are in the network. If you're planning surgery, ask whether the anesthesiologists are in the network. If available, the facility should accommodate your request to use a network provider for your services. Similarly, for AlaskaCare covered dental services, you may prevent balance billing by verifying the provider is in the Moda/Delta Dental network. If your provider is not a network provider, you may ask for an estimate of charges, the codes that will be used use for billing, and the provider's zip code. When you receive this information, contact the Aetna Concierge at [(855) 784-8646](tel:8557848646) or Moda/Delta Dental at [(855) 718-1768](tel:8557181768). A member of the Aetna Concierge or Moda Customer Service team can review the estimated charges and will advise you if the charges fall within the recognized charge for your area. If the estimated charges exceed the recognized charge, you may request that your provider accept that amount and not balance bill you, or you may request payment arrangements with their office. If your current provider is not listed as a network provider, you can ask your provider to contact Aetna at [(800) 720-4009](tel:8007204009) or Moda at [(855) 718-1768](tel:8557181768) for a participation application. Members are also encouraged to nominate their out-of-network providers to join the network. Contact the Aetna Concierge or Moda Customer Service to find out how. In some cases, unfortunately, there will not be a network provider for the service you need in your area. The Division, Aetna and Moda/Delta Dental are working diligently to improve network access, but please understand that we cannot force providers into the network. Yes, there is a network of providers for durable medical equipment. For assistance finding a network provider call the Aetna Concierge at [(855) 784-8646](tel:8557848646) or search online using the [Aetna DocFind tool](//aetna.com/dsepublic/#/contentPage?page=providerSearchLanding&site_id=alaskacare) . Medicare The AlaskaCare Retiree health plan was created by statute to provide health coverage to eligible retirees and their dependents in 1975. Alaska Statute Sec. 39.35.535(b) requires that the retiree health plan become supplemental to federal old age benefits available at age 65. This statute has been in effect since 1975. The Retiree Insurance Information Booklet section titled, \"Effect of Medicare\", states: \"If you do not enroll in Medicare coverage the estimated amount Medicare would have paid will be deducted from your claim before processing by this plan.\" [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#medicare) If you are currently eligible for Medicare, or when you become eligible for Medicare, you will be automatically enrolled in the AlaskaCare EGWP plan (a group Medicare Part D plan) by the Division of Retirement and Benefits. You do not need to enroll in an individual Medicare Part D plan. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#medicare) You are not required to take part in Medicare part C. Part C plans are Medicare Advantage plans provided by private insurers for members who live outside the State of Alaska. They cover the same services as Medicare Part A and B combined as well as some supplemental benefits. The AlaskaCare plan acts as a supplemental plan for Medicare eligible retirees. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#medicare) Most people are eligible for premium-free Part A. After members apply for Medicare Part A & B, they will receive a decision letter from Social Security notifying them if they qualify for premium-free Part A. Members who do not qualify for premium-free Medicare Part A, should not enroll in Part A, they must provide a copy of the Social Security letter to the AlaskaCare health claims administrator and the Division of Retirement & Benefits, and AlaskaCare will continue to pay as your primary plan for Part A services. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#medicare) Preventive Care Preventive care was not part of the original benefits covered by the AlaskaCare Retiree plan when it was created in 1975. Effective January 1, 2022, the Division of Retirement and Benefits is expanding preventive care coverage to the Retiree Defined Benefit health plan. [Learn More](/docs/booklets/DB-RetireeInsuranceBooklet_WEB.pdf) Preventive care coverage includes, but is not limited to vaccinations, wellness visits, colorectal cancer screenings, mammograms, pap smears, prostate cancer screenings, and lung cancer screenings. Like other health plans, services covered by the Plan are based on those recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and other governmental advisory groups and may include additional services as outlined in the Third-Party Administrator's guidelines. These guidelines will change over time as they are updated to reflect the most current research and evidence. After January 1, 2022, when you visit an in-network provider for preventive services, your AlaskaCare plan will pay 100% coinsurance and your deductible will not apply. For preventive care received from out-of-network providers, you will first have to meet the $150 deductible, and then the plan would pay 80% coinsurance (up to the recognized charge) for covered services. Your AlaskaCare out-of-pocket maximum will not apply to preventive care services received from out-of-network providers. If you do not have access to an Aetna network provider in your area, you may contact Aetna to pre-certify use of an out-of-network provider, and those services will be paid as though they were received in-network. Many retiree plan members have other health coverage, such as Medicare, or additional coverage through their spouse. The AlaskaCare plan will continue to coordinate with other plans the way it does today when determining payment for covered services. Yes, colorectal cancer screenings including colonoscopies and at-home stool tests (such as Cologuard) will be covered in accordance with the standards outlined by the US Preventive Task Force and current clinical guidelines and frequency limitations outlined by the Third-Party Administrator's (currently Aetna) clinical policy bulletins. In alignment with the Plan booklet, Section 3.3.1 Medically Necessary Services and Supplies, and mainstream commercial health insurance practices, the Plan will utilize the current Third-Party Administrator's (currently Aetna) clinical coverage standards for purposes of determining coverage of preventive services under the Plan. These standards must include, at a minimum, those services with an \"A\" or \"B\" recommendation by the USPTF but may include additional services or screenings. Clinical coverage standards regarding preventive care are subject to change and are updated periodically based the most current clinical evidence. [Learn More](/docs/booklets/DB-RetireeInsuranceBooklet_WEB.pdf) Yes. Common vaccines included in the proposed preventive care coverage are hepatitis A & B, HPV, influenza (flu shot), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), meningitis, pneumococcal (pneumonia shot), tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, chickenpox, rabies, and shingles. Beginning January 1, 2019, all retirees have access to the shingles vaccine, which is covered by AlaskaCare when administered at a pharmacy. The addition of preventive care services means effective January 1, 2022 you can also receive the shingles vaccine at your doctor's office. No, Silver Sneakers is only available to people who are covered by a participating Medicare Advantage or Medicare Supplement Insurance plan. The Division is working to evaluate if any similar programs could be offered to retirees in the future. Special Medication Prior Authorization Prior authorization is a pre-approval process guided by rigorous clinical standards for intensive, high-cost medical procedures. Prior authorization for specialty medications: - Ensures the therapy meets FDA guidelines for the condition being treated. - Ensures providers follow nationally recognized care criteria when prescribing medication. - Requires the prescriber to provide documentation in support of the clinical criteria specific to that medication prior to the medication being dispensed. Prior authorization for specialty drugs is a pharmacy management process that reviews certain medications against clinical, evidence-based standards including those established by the FDA to promote safe and effective use of those medications. A specialty medication has at least one of the following characteristics: - High Priced: can cost more than $1,000 for a 30-day supply. - Complex: drug imitates compounds found in the body or is part of a specialty drug class. - High-Touch: special shipping or handling requirements like refrigeration, special steps to follow as you take it, needs a pharmacist or doctor to measure how well it works for you. Call Optum Rx at [(855) 427-4682](tel:8554274682) to enroll in this specialty pharmacy program. Only about 1% of covered prescriptions are specialty medications. You can review the [Optum Rx Specialty Pharmacy Drug List](/docs/brochures/SpecialtyDrugListBrochure.pdf) (Effective January, 1 2023) to see if any of your current medications are specialty drugs that may require a prior authorization. If your drug appears on this list, you need to obtain a prior authorization prior to filling your prescription after January 1, 2023 If any of your medications require a prior authorization after January 1, 2023, you will receive a notification letter with detailed information. Please note this list may change over time and is for informational purposes only. If you have any questions, contact Optum Rx at [(855) 409-6999](tel:8554096999). While it is not necessary to obtain a prior authorization for your specialty medication prescription before January 1, 2022, you may call Optum Rx at [(855) 409-6999](tel:8554096999) and the customer service agents can help you to submit all of the required pieces of information ahead of time. If you do so, Optum Rx will initiate your specialty medication prior authorization on your behalf after January 1, 2022. Yes. Members will receive a notification letter advising their medication requires prior authorization review. Once you have an approved prior authorization in place, when it nears expiration, Optum Rx will proactively initiate outreach to your prescriber to obtain the information necessary to extend or renew the authorization. Providers may submit prior authorization requests electronically, over the phone, or by mail. The prior authorization process is designed with expediency in mind. Most prior authorizations are completed within 72 hours. Physicians can use an electronic platform called Pre-Check my script for real-time information and authorizations. Yes. This is common in health plans and physicians are already familiar with the prior authorization process. Providers may submit prior authorization requests electronically, over the phone, or by mail. Some medications should be reviewed for coverage because: - They're only approved for, and effective in, treating specific illnesses. - They may be inappropriately prescribed for conditions for which effectiveness has not been demonstrated. - They may have dispensing and prescribing requirements specific to a patient's age, gender, other medication usage, or clinical condition. Benefits of prior authorization include ensuring the right drug is dispensed at the right time and safety and efficacy standards are adhered to. Members may experience improved quality care when evidence-based criteria are reviewed to promote appropriate use of certain specialty medications. Prior authorization approvals are typically valid for 3-36 months, depending on the medication. Optum Rx identifies approved prior authorizations for prescriptions expiring within 30 days and will proactively reach out to the prescriber to request any information needed to extend the prior authorization. Specialty medications are a relatively new type of treatment that has grown substantially over the last few years. In 2020, specialty medications accounted for about 1% of all prescriptions covered by the AlaskaCare retiree plan but cost $110 million in covered plan expenses. A single prescription can cost as much as $160K or more annually. Similar to how the Plan requires precertification for certain intensive, complex, and high-cost medical services, prior authorization is a common tool used by pharmacy plans to ensure appropriate use. Growth of specialty medication is expected to continue as new medications are developed and the conditions they are used to treat expand. Implementing a prior authorization process for the medications ensures that they are being used for indications approved by the FDA and align with guidelines established by national clinical specialist groups. There is no change to coverage for prescription medications that are prescribed under the terms outlined in the Plan booklet. The plan will continue to cover medically necessary and clinically appropriate prescription drugs. There is no change to member copayments which will remain $8 for brand medications, $4 for generic medications, and $0 for medications filled through mail order. At Optum Rx, prior authorization criteria are reviewed and approved by the Optum Rx Pharmacy & Therapeutics (P&T) Committee. The P&T Committee is an independent, multi-specialty and nationally represented group of physicians and pharmacists. The P&T Committee evaluates medications based on scientific evidence to find their place in therapy. Quarterly meetings are held to evaluate, review, and make clinical recommendations. Industry, clinical, and company standards govern the P&T Committee's review, consideration, and recommendation processes. The committee considers: - U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved indications - Manufacturer's package labeling instructions - Well-accepted and/or published clinical recommendations (ex: American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information; DRUGDEX; National Comprehensive Cancer Network Drugs and Biologics Compendium; Clinical Pharmacology; major peer reviewed medical journals such as the American Journal of Medicine) Based on this information, the P&T Committee evaluates whether a drug has a unique therapeutic benefit, comparable safety and efficacy, or whether risk of harm outweighs the benefits. The P&T Committee complies with national quality standards including those provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC\u00ae). After thorough clinical review of prior authorization guidelines is complete, the P&T Committee approves the utilization management criteria. No. Prior Authorizations are not step therapy. Step therapy is focused on cost and, has not been implemented in the retiree plan. Prior authorization focuses on clinical indicators, and ensures that a prescription drug is medically necessary, appropriately prescribed, and meets FDA and other clinical guidelines for the condition being treated. The AlaskaCare Retiree Pharmacy Plan provides members with the right to appeal the pharmacy claims and prior authorizations that have been denied by the pharmacy claims administrator, Optum Rx. If a claim or prior authorizations is denied, in whole or in part, your letter from Optum Rx will explain the reason for the denial. Please refer to your Retiree Insurance Information Booklet located at AlaskaCare.gov for coverage information and if necessary, call Optum Rx toll-free at [(855) 409-6999](tel:8554096999) for further clarification. 2022 Benefit Expansion The Division of Retirement and Benefit has been working with the Retiree Health Plan Advisory Board (RHPAB) to review proposed updates to the AlaskaCare Defined Benefit Retiree Health Plan (Plan). These updates will add modern coverage provisions to the Plan, including highly desired coverage for preventive care service and prior authorizations for specialty medications. The Plan Administrator (the Commissioner of Administration) has adopted the proposed updates, and the Plan will be changed to include the expanded coverage beginning on January 1, 2022. The proposed changes will take effect on January 1, 2022. This means that the expanded coverage will apply to any dates of service on or after January 1, 2022. No, the Retiree Plan monthly premiums for 2022 are not changing. As a retiree-only plan, the Plan is exempt from the ACA provisions mandating coverage for preventive care. Though the additional benefits offered do align with the ACA's preventive care provisions, these provisions do not impact the retiree plan. In alignment with the Plan booklet, Section 3.3.1 Medically Necessary Services and Supplies, and mainstream commercial health insurance practices, the Plan will utilize the current Third-Party Administrator's (TPA) clinical coverage standards for purposes of determining coverage of preventive services under the Plan. [Learn More](/docs/booklets/DB-RetireeInsuranceBooklet_WEB.pdf) General Members of the Defined Contribution Retirement plan (Public Employees' Retirement System Tier IV and Teachers' Retirement System Tier III) and their eligible dependents can participate. To be eligible for medical coverage you must have: - 10 years of service and be Medicare age eligible, or - Be any age with 25 years of service for peace officers/firefighters or; - Be any age with 30 years of service for all others. - Must have worked the prior 12 months and retire directly from the system. Specific information on your individual tier status can be obtained through the Division of Retirement and Benefits Member Services Contact Center at or by calling [(907) 465-4460](tel:9074654460) in Juneau or [(800) 821-2251](tel:8008212251) toll-free Monday through Thursday from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. or Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. In general, if you are a member of the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) and first entered service after June 30, 2006, you are Tier IV. If you are a member of the Teachers' Retirement System (TRS) and first entered the system after June 30, 2006, you are a Tier III. - Your spouse. You may be legally separated but not divorced. - Your children from birth (exclusive of hospital nursery charges at birth and newborn care) up to 23 years of age only if they are: - your natural children, stepchildren, foster children placed through a State foster child program, legally adopted children, children in your physical custody and for whom bona fide adoption proceedings are underway, or children for whom you are legal, court-appointed guardian (if child is not your natural-born child); - unmarried and chiefly dependent upon you for support; AND - living with you in a normal parent-child relationship. - This provision is waived for natural/adopted children of the benefit recipient who are living with a divorced spouse, assuming all other criteria is met. Stepchildren must live with the retiree 50% or more of the time to be covered under this plan. - In addition, if they are between the ages of 19 and 23, they must be attending school regularly on a full-time basis. Children incapable of employment because of a mental or physical incapacity are covered even if they are past age 23. However, the incapacity must have existed before age 23 and the children must continue to be unmarried, rely chiefly on you for support and living with you in a normal parent-child relationship. You must furnish the claims administrator evidence of the incapacity, proof that the incapacity existed before age 19, and proof of financial dependency. Children are covered as long as the incapacity exists and they meet the definition of children, except for age. Periodic proof of the continued incapacity may be required. The definition of retiree dependents limiting coverage to age 19 (or age 23 if a full-time student) comes directly from Alaska statute. Expanding dependent coverage to age 26 is one of the provisions in the Federal Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act (PPACA) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (HCERA) that became effective March 2010. This provision affects employee plans and retiree-only health plans differently. On June 14, 2010, the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury issued regulations on Grandfathered Health Plans under PPACA. In the preamble to the Interim Final Rule, the Secretaries clarify that it is not their intent to apply the PPACA coverage to retiree-only health plans. This means the retiree medical plan, is not subject to the expanded dependent coverage provisions of PPACA. You should have a medical ID card from Aetna and a pharmacy ID card from Optum Rx. If you elected the DVA plan you will also have a dental ID card from Delta Dental/Moda and a vision card from Aetna. You can use your ID cards when visiting your health care providers or pharmacy.

[Delta Dental](//deltadentalak.com/alaskacare/#mymoda) Premiums Employees do not contribute to the DCR health trust while they are actively working. When the employee retires, the DCR medical plan requires Medicare-eligible participants to pay a percentage of the monthly premium. Prior to Medicare eligibility, retirees pay 100 percent of the DCR medical plan cost. After Medicare eligibility, retirees pay a percentage of the plan cost based on years of service: Network Using network providers can provide substantial benefits to members and their dependent(s) who are not yet Medicare age eligible through the elimination of what's known as \"balance billing.\" It can also generate substantial savings to members through negotiated provider discounts. To find out whether your doctor is a member of the Aetna network, call Aetna's Health Concierge at [(855) 784-8646](tel:8557848646). To find out whether your dentist is a member of the Moda/Delta Dental network call Moda/Delta Dental at [(855) 718-1768](tel:8557181768). Yes, as long as the service is provided (billed) by a preferred hospital or facility. However, you may find that not all providers at a preferred hospital or facility are part of the network. For example, if you have a surgical procedure performed at a preferred hospital, you may find that the hospital and surgeon are in the network, but the anesthesiologist is out-of-network. When you receive your bill, you'll see that it reflects the negotiated network rates for your hospital and surgeon. The anesthesiologist, however, may charge what they chooses since they have no negotiated network contract. If the anesthesiologist claim exceeds the recognized charge, you may receive a bill for the balance. It is wise to talk to your providers before incurring any expenses to see if they are covered in the network. You can also call the Aetna Concierge for additional information at [(855) 784-8646](tel:8557848646) prior to receiving services. No. The 20% coinsurance differential that applies to out-of-network facilities only applies to the facility services or supplies, and not to the professional services billed by the provider. Similarly, the increased annual out-of-pocket maximum, and out-of-network facility recognized charge calculation do not apply to the professional services billed by the provider. If you receive care at an out-of-network hospital or other facility either in the Anchorage area or outside of Alaska, including surgery centers, birthing centers, rehabilitative centers, and residential treatment centers, you may be subject to higher out-of-pocket costs. These include a 20% reduction in the coinsurance that the plan pays; and an increase in the individual out-of-pocket maximum. Additionally, the maximum allowable rate for out-of-network facility charges is the lesser of what the facility bills or submits for that service or supply, or the percentage of Medicare that most closely reflects the aggregate contracted rate with the preferred hospital or facility (currently 185% of Medicare). To avoid incurring a penalty, be sure to use the preferred hospital or facility in your area. There may not be a preferred hospital or facility in some parts of Alaska, and in those instances, members will not incur a penalty. However, it is recommended you contact the Aetna Concierge for additional information at [(855) 784-8646](tel:8557848646) prior to receiving services. The DCR medical plan only penalizes use of out-of-network providers for the following services: hospital and facility services, preventive care, and limited circumstances such as transplants or inpatient mental health treatment. If you require these types of services, it is important to contact the Aetna concierge team. They can help you find a network provider or facility in your area, or discuss options with you. The DCR medical plan does provide travel coverage for treatment not provided locally or for surgery or diagnostic procedures that can be obtained more cheaply in another geographic region and members may explore these options with the Aetna Concierge team at [(855) 784-8646](tel:8557848646) prior to receiving services. Aetna does have a DME national provider listing on their DocFind website. To see the current listing, go to AlaskaCare.gov and select the Find a Doctor tool. In DocFind type \"durable medical equipment\" in the \"Search for:\" box and enter the appropriate zip code and plan. The DME national provider list can be found at the top of the generated list, followed by local DME providers, if any. There is no penalty for using an out of network durable medical equipment provider; but you may save money by using a network provider and a non-network provider may bill you for charges above the allowable. Medicare You are not required to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B, but the AlaskaCare Retiree Benefit Plan for DCR Plan Retirees will estimate the portion that Medicare would have covered before paying benefits regardless of your enrollment status. Therefore not enrolling in Medicare Part A & B as soon as you become age eligible may have very significant negative financial impacts for you. Members are strongly urged to consider enrolling in Medicare Part A & B three months prior to their 65th birthday. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#medicare) For many people, Medicare Part A is premium-free. However, if you are not eligible for premium-free Part A, you may need to pay a monthly premium. Everyone must pay a monthly premium for Medicare Part B. For information on how you may be reimbursed for Medicare premiums from your Health Reimbursement Arrangement Account, see section 4, Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) of the plan booklet. For additional information, visit [Medicare.gov](//medicare.gov/) . [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#medicare) Currently, you are not required to enroll in Medicare Part D as the drug coverage benefits you have through your AlaskaCare Retiree plan are at least as good as the required benefits offered under Medicare Part D. By not enrolling in Part D, you can avoid unnecessary premiums and coordination between Medicare and AlaskaCare for your prescription drugs. When the plan incorporates the Employer Group Waiver Program, this will change and you will receive additional instruction and communication in advance of this change. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#medicare) You are not required, but may opt to take part in Medicare part C. Part C plans are Medicare Advantage plans provided by private insurers for members who live outside the State of Alaska. They cover the same services as Medicare Part A and B combined as well as some supplemental benefits. The AlaskaCare plan acts as a supplemental plan for Medicare eligible retirees, but you may elect to take part in Medicare part C in lieu of the AlaskaCare Retiree Benefit Plan for DCR Plan Retirees. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#medicare) Health Reimbursement Arrangement The Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) is an IRS approved individual savings account, funded by employer contributions, used to reimburse eligible DCR participants tax-free for qualified out-of-pocket medical expenses and individual health insurance premiums. You or your dependent's qualified medical expenses that are payable from your HRA include the following: - Amounts paid for health insurance premiums. - Copays, coinsurance, deductible, services, etc. not covered under AlaskaCare or another health plan. - Amounts paid for prescription medication, but not over-the-counter drugs unless prescribed by a licensed health care provider. You can find a general list of IRS-approved health-related reimbursements in [Publication 502](//irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-502) online at IRS.gov. To be eligible you must have retired directly from the DCR plan OR be eligible for Medicare and have a minimum of 10 years of service. For purposes of the HRA, to be considered retired directly from the plan, you must: - Have at least 30 years of service (other than peace officers and firefighters); or - Have at least 25 years of service if you are a peace officer or firefighter; or - Be a surviving spouse of a participant who had retired or who was eligible for retirement and medical benefits at the time of the participant's death; or - Be an eligible dependent of a surviving spouse. General Upon retirement, AlaskaCare retiree beneficiaries may choose to participate in a voluntary Dental-Vision-Audio (DVA) plan to provide coverage for themselves and their eligible dependents. Unlike the medical and pharmacy plans, the DVA plan benefits are funded entirely by member-paid premiums. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#dva) The DVA open enrollment is the time period during which you can make changes to your dental benefits. If you have questions about this enrollment period please contact the Division at [(800) 821-2251](tel:8008212251), or email to learn about your options. You will be able to change your dental plan each year during an open enrollment period for as long as the State offers two dental plans. [Learn More](/events/dvaenrollment.html) Offering two dental plans provides maximum benefit and choice to all members. Each DVA plan has different dental coverage provisions and different monthly premium rates. The vision and audio coverage does not vary between the two DVA plans. [Learn More](/events/dvaenrollment.html) You can find information about the two DVA plans online, including the following: If you have questions about your options, please contact the [Member Service Center](/contact/center.html) or Delta Dental of Alaska at [(855) 718-1768](tel:8557181768). [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#dva) Standard Dental Plan - Features an additional dental network, Delta Dental's PPO network, with deeper discounts that save you more money when you use a network dentist. This allows you to receive coverage for more services before you reach your annual benefit maximum. Standard plan members can also access lower rates from dentists who participate in Delta Dental's broader Premier dental network. - Supports evidence-based coverage limitations, including those developed by the American Dental Association, such as frequency and age limitations for exams, cleanings, and periodontal maintenance. - Pays less if you visit an out-of-network dentist. - Does not have pre-determined frequency or age limitations on most services. - Features a wide dental network, Delta Dental's Premier dental network, that saves you money when you use a network dentist. - Pays out-of-network dentists at a higher rate. Some dental procedures fall into different service classes, depending on which plan you elect. If you would like to know how a specific service would be covered under each plan, call Delta Dental of Alaska at [(855) 718-1768](tel:8557181768). Please consult the [2022 Dental Benefit Comparison](/docs/materials/DVAComparison2022.pdf) for more details about the differences between the plans.

[Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#dva) Yes, both the standard plan and the legacy plan let you see any licensed dentist you want. Both plans give you access to a wide network of dental providers that will save you money. If you choose the legacy plan and see an out-of-network provider, the plan will cover a greater portion of the charges so you may pay less for out-of-network services. If you choose the standard plan, you have access to an additional network of providers that offer deeper discounts, saving you more money, but you may pay more if you use out-of-network dentists. Remember, if you use an out-of-network dentist, you may receive additional bills for charges that the plan will not cover. [Find a Provider](/retiree/healthplans.html#network) Each year the Division will host an open enrollment period that allows members to change their DVA plan elections for the upcoming plan year. You will find the enrollment link at [AlaskaCare.gov/DVA](/events/dvaenrollment.html). If you have questions about the enrollment period please contact the Member Service Center at [(800) 821-2251](tel:8008212251), or email . While the Division offers multiple plans, you will have an annual opportunity to select the plan that works best for you. You will only be able to make changes to your plan selection during an open enrollment period unless you have a qualifying status change. You can cancel your DVA election at any time by contacting the Division. [Learn More](/events/dvaenrollment.html) If you updated your plan due to a qualifying status change, you can expect new cards in the mail within 10 to 14 days from when you submitted the change. [Learn More](/events/dvaenrollment.html) Coverage You may have heard about a lawsuit related to the AlaskaCare Dental-Vision-Audio (DVA) plan. In 2014, in an effort to protect you from rising premiums and to preserve the value of your benefits, the Division updated the dental portion of the DVA plan to align with best dental practices and reduce the cost of services through an expanded dental network. This sought to preserve the plan's value while maintaining members' access to care and averting premium increases. In January 2016, a lawsuit was filed contesting the Division's efforts. In April 2019, the Alaska Superior Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff. This decision resulted in two DVA plans being offered, the Standard DVA plan and the Legacy DVA plan. This decision was appealed to the Alaska Supreme Court. On January 21, 2022, the Alaska Supreme Court vacated the Superior Court's judgement. The Division is evaluating the decision. There will be no immediate changes to the AlaskaCare Retiree Dental-Vision-Audio benefits. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#dva) Yes, you may decrease your DVA level of coverage at any time. To decrease your coverage, submit a written request to the Division stating the level of coverage you would like. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#dva) Yes. If you have a second retirement (you retire from TRS and then from PERS, for example), you may elect coverage under both plans. Or if you are covered by your spouse's plan, you may elect to have a second plan for yourself or yourself and your eligible dependents. The benefit to having two DVA plans is they coordinate to pay 100% of covered expenses. For example, a filling is covered at 80% under one plan and the second plan pays the remaining 20%. In addition, any annual dollar limits are doubled. For example, the dental plan has a $2,000 maximum and each plan pays up to $2,000, for a total of $4,000, for covered expenses. Service limits, one eye examination per year for example, are not doubled. If none of these rules apply, the plan that has covered you longer is the primary plan. If you have two health plans, any dollar limits are doubled. For example, the dental annual maximum pays up to $2,000 of covered expenses under one plan and another $2,000 under the second plan for a total of $4,000 of covered expenses. Any services that are limited to a maximum number of services in a year are not doubled. For example, if you have two plans that each cover a single vision exam each year, the plans coordinate to cover up to 100% of a single vision exam; they do not pay for two vision exams in a year. For further information and details on coordination of benefits, please see the Retiree Health Plan Information booklet. It is your responsibility to report the existence of benefits payable under any plan, and to file for those benefits. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#dva) Yes. Regardless of which plan each of you selects, your coverage will continue to coordinate. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#dva) No. A retiree may only select one plan for themselves and any covered dependents. However, if you and your spouse each have a separate AlaskaCare DVA policy, you may select different plans and cover each other as dependents. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#dva) Benefits The plans have different dental coverage provisions and different monthly premium rates. The Retiree Dental Benefit Comparison may help you compare the plans and decide which is a better fit for you and your family. The AlaskaCare Retiree Insurance Information Booklets will contain the complete benefit provisions for both the standard and legacy dental plans. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#dva) No. The vision and audio benefits are not affected by which dental plan you choose. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#dva) Premiums and Cost The standard and legacy plan monthly premiums are set to reflect the overall value of each plan across all enrolled members. The value of each plan varies based on differences in benefit design, network access, and how much the plan pays out-of-network providers. The rates are not impacted by how many people elect one plan or the other. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#dva) Network To find a network dental provider, call Delta Dental of Alaska at [(855) 718-1768](tel:8557181768) or use the [Find a Dentist](//modahealth.com/ProviderSearch/faces/webpages/home.xhtml) search tool. When you need dental care, selecting a provider that is in-network can save both you and the plan money. [Find a Provider](/retiree/healthplans.html#network) Visiting a dental provider who participates in Delta Dental's network is one of the best ways to get the most value out of your dental coverage. Network dentists have agreed to provide you services at a discounted rate and will file all claim forms for you. The Premier network is a broad network of providers who offer savings to members. Both AlaskaCare standard and legacy dental plan members have access to the Premier network and associated discounts. The PPO network is a narrower network of providers who offer deeper discounts and savings to members. In addition to the Premier network, AlaskaCare standard plan members have access to the PPO network and associated discounts. The PPO network is like a \"network within a network\" that helps you receive the best prices for the dental care you need.

[Learn More](/retiree/ltc.html#eligibility) The plans cover licensed nursing care facilities, in-home care provided by a licensed home health care agency, and adult day care. The Silver, Gold and Platinum plans also cover assisted living facilities and respite care. Care provided by family members or outside of the United States is not covered. [Learn More](/retiree/ltc.html) The deductible period is 90 days under all plans. You must receive 90 days of covered care before benefits are paid. You may be in any level of care or multiple levels of care to satisfy the 90 days. For example, you may be in home health care for 60 days and in a nursing home for another 30 days to meet the deductible period. You do not need to receive care every day during the 90-day period. If you receive care only certain days of the week, you still receive credit for the full week of care toward the 90-day deductible.

The AlaskaCare Retiree Vision Plan does not have a network. This means you may choose to see any provider and receive plan benefits for covered services. No, you are responsible for submitting your vision claims to Aetna for processing. Your provider may be willing to file the claim for you, but it is the member's responsibility. For the AlaskaCare Retiree Vision and Audio Plans, you may print an ID card that includes your name and Aetna ID number by logging on to Aetna's online Navigator tool and clicking \"Get an ID Card.\" If you are not registered for Aetna Navigator, you may call Aetna Concierge at [(855) 784-8646](tel:8557848646) to obtain your Aetna ID number to give your provider.

This gives us an opportunity to seek better service at lower cost for members and the plan. Effective January 1, 2019, the AlaskaCare plan uses Optum Rx as the PBM to administer pharmacy benefits. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#pharmacy) Optum Rx will process claims according to the AlaskaCare plan document. Compounds will continue to be covered under the Defined Benefit Retiree Health plan. Coverage of compounds differs for the active employee and defined contribution retiree health plans. The AlaskaCare Employee Health Plan and AlaskaCare DCR Benefit Plan only cover compound drugs if: - the product contains at least one prescription ingredient; - the active ingredient(s) is approved by the FDA for medicinal use in the United States; - the product is not a copy of a commercially available FDA approved drug; and - the safety and effectiveness for the intended use is supported by FDA approval, or adequate medical and scientific evidence in the medical literature. Optum Rx maintains a National Compound Credentialing Program (NCCP) to ensure the best compounded medication quality and effectiveness for the patients who need personalized medications. You must fill your compounded medication prescription at a pharmacy which has been credentialed with the Optum Rx National Compound Credentialing Program (NCCP). Using an NCCP pharmacy ensures that you will not be charged up front for your prescription (and required to submit your own claim for reimbursement), you will not be charged for molding or other non-covered charges, and you will not be charged for shipping if the pharmacy mails your compounded medication to you. You can find a list of NCCP-credentialed pharmacies here. You can also call Optum Rx at [(855) 409-6999](tel:8554096999) (TTY 711) to get help locating NCCP-credentialed pharmacies.

Each card will have an individual name and ID number. Although you receive only one card, when you present the card at the pharmacy you will receive the benefit of your double coverage under the plan. This means you will not be required to pay a copay at the pharmacy counter. - One of us is a Medicare-eligible retiree enrolled in the enhanced Employer Group Waiver Program (EGWP) and the other is either an active employee or a retiree not enrolled in EGWP: The retiree who is Medicare-eligible and is enrolled in the enhanced Employer Group Waiver Program (EGWP) will receive a single ID card that has the MedicareRx logo in the lower right (see example below). The card will have their individual name and ID number. Although they receive only one card, when they present the card at the pharmacy, they will receive the benefit of having double coverage under the plan. This means they will not be required to pay a copay at the pharmacy counter. The spouse who is not enrolled in the EGWP will receive an ID card two-pack in their own name for each layer of coverage they have (their own coverage and their dependent coverage as the spouse of a Medicare-eligible retiree). The only difference between the two packs of ID cards will be the ID number. The ID number that matches the Medicare-eligible retiree's MedicareRx ID card will be the dependent coverage card. - Both my spouse and I are either an active employee or a retiree not yet eligible for Medicare: - I am covered under more than one of my own AlaskaCare plans, and... - I am eligible for Medicare: If you are eligible for Medicare and are enrolled in the enhanced Employer Group Waiver Program (EGWP), you should receive a single ID card that has the MedicareRx logo in the lower right (see example below).

However, because Aetna and their contractor CVS/Caremark no longer administer AlaskaCare pharmacy claims, all AlaskaCare members will receive updated ID cards from Aetna that reflects their medical benefit coverage. Retirees will receive two new ID cards from Aetna - one for medical coverage, and one for vision/audio coverage. You should use your Aetna ID card at your doctor's office, and your Optum Rx ID card at the pharmacy counter.

However, a non-EGWP dependent should not use the card that has a MedicareRx logo in the lower right corner. This card would only work if the pharmacist uses the correct person code (to identify them as a dependent rather than the policy holder). To avoid any confusion at the pharmacy, we recommend you and your dependents only use a card that has your name on it.

EGWP is estimated to save the health plan approximately $20 million per year and between $40 to $60 million more annually to the State with no diminishment and minimal impact to the membership and existing plan. EGWP is one method offered by the federal government to provide subsidies to the State of Alaska retiree health trusts. The subsidies help the State keep the health plan funding healthy without impacting most members. We already have a federal reimbursement plan in place called a Retiree Drug Subsidy program (RDS), but EGWP provides greater returns. Many large employers have made the move from RDS to EGWP because of the significant cost savings and the ability to match existing benefits. Implementing an EGWP means that retirees and beneficiaries who are eligible for Medicare will have the same level and access to pharmacy benefits as they do now, while making more federal funds available to cover those costs. The savings helps the State fulfill its promise to provide retirement benefits to our AlaskaCare retirees. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#egwp) An enhanced EGWP, like the AlaskaCare EGWP, is a plan that includes medications covered under Medicare Part D, as well as any medications currently covered under the AlaskaCare retiree health plan that are not typically covered under Medicare. This ensures that all prescription drugs which are covered under the AlaskaCare plan today will be covered under the AlaskaCare EGWP. This enhanced coverage is also called a \"wrap.\" [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#egwp) Much the same way the plan works today. When a member goes to a pharmacy, they will present their AlaskaCare pharmacy ID card. The pharmacy will submit the claim. If the prescription is covered by Medicare, it will be covered by EGWP. Members will pay their normal copay ($0 home delivery; $4 generic; $8 brand-name) and collect their medication. If the prescription is not covered by Medicare, it will automatically bill to the \"wrap\" plan. The member will pay their same copay and collect their medication. Either way, the member shouldn't notice a difference. In the beginning, members may need to get prior authorizations for certain medications. A list of those medications is available on the AlaskaCare Optum Rx information web page. If you are currently taking a medication that requires prior authorization, your doctor will need to complete some information requested by Optum Rx. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#egwp) If you are currently eligible for Medicare, or when you first enroll in Medicare, you need to provide the Division your Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI - your Medicare Number). You do not need to enroll in an individual Medicare Part D plan. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#egwp) Periodically, the Division competitively bids these contracts through a Request for Proposal (RFP). This gives the Division an opportunity to seek better service at lower cost for members and the plan. The previous procurement process resulted in Optum Rx being selected to provide Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) services beginning January 1, 2019. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html#pharmacy) No. There is one Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) for all AlaskaCare prescription drug plans, including the AlaskaCare EGWP, Optum Rx. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html#pharmacy) Alaska law already requires that for Alaska retirees and beneficiaries, Medicare become the primary coverage for major benefits once they are Medicare-eligible. As a Medicare Part D plan, an EGWP would follow this same statutory requirement. By implementing an enhanced EGWP, like the proposed AlaskaCare EGWP (which covers some medications that are not currently covered under Medicare Part D), the benefits will remain the same as those in place today. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html#pharmacy) Yes, beginning January 1, 2019. As a group Medicare Part D plan, the AlaskaCare EGWP covers most vaccines if they are administered at a pharmacy. They may also be covered when received in a doctor's office, but only if the doctor's office coordinates with a pharmacy to bill the plan for the entire cost of the vaccination, including the injection of the vaccine. This coverage will extend to all retirees as of that date, including retirees who are not Medicare-eligible and are therefore not enrolled in the enhanced EGWP. Generally, Medicare Part D covers all commercially-available shots needed to prevent illness. Common vaccines include shingles, diphtheria, tetanus, measles-mumps-rubella, polio, hepatitis A & B, and HPV. Please note that flu and pneumococcal shots are typically covered by Medicare Part B, and therefore will not be covered by the AlaskaCare plan. You can find a complete list of covered vaccines in the formulary on the AlaskaCare Optum Rx information web page. Each vaccine is listed in the formulary as \"viral vaccine\" under the therapeutic drug class. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html#pharmacy) Yes. AlaskaCare is extending these same benefits to non-Medicare eligible retiree and dependents. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html#pharmacy) No! As an AlaskaCare member, your health benefits are protected, and it's the Division's job to ensure those benefits remain protected and sustained. Although the EGWP is not protected under Alaska''s constitution, your retiree benefits are. Using an enhanced EGWP and covering additional medications that are not covered by a standalone EGWP will ensure that you continue to receive the same level of benefits consistent with the protections in the Alaska Constitution. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) Yes. The Division will be closely monitoring the program and will evaluate whether it is in Alaska's best interest to continue using this type of program. If the Division determines that it is not meeting the needs of our members or the State, the Division can disenroll. Like all Medicare programs, EGWP could change if federal laws and regulations change. Regardless of what happens in the future, Alaska has an obligation to provide pharmacy benefits and will continue to do so. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is interested in preserving pharmacy benefits for retirees and in providing an incentive to states or other large employers to continue providing these benefits to retirees. While Alaska will not discontinue retiree pharmacy benefits, this is a concern in many other states and for other large employers with retiree health plans. If retiree drug plans are discontinued, more people will enroll in Medicare Part D, which would mean the federal government shoulders more of the cost. Subsidizing state and employer plans encourages those plans to provide retiree drug benefits and is in everyone's interest. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) No, the prescription drugs covered under the current plan and the AlaskaCare EGWP will be the same. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) Although these are terms you may hear associated with an EGWP, these stages will not impact your benefits. They are different stages defined by Medicare based on your total drug costs. The \"donut hole\" policy for coverage of pharmacy benefits is a feature of some Medicare Part D plans, but the design of the AlaskaCare enhanced EGWP ensure that you will not be directly impacted by a coverage gap, because the State covers the pharmacy costs not covered under Medicare Part D. This extra coverage ensures your out-of-pocket costs for drugs will not change. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) Because the AlaskaCare enhanced EGWP is a group Medicare Part D plan, if you have multiple retiree prescription drug coverages the AlaskaCare enhanced EGWP will become the primary payer. If your other retiree coverage previously had been the primary payer, it will move into the secondary payer position. Your total coverage levels will not change. Your medications will still be covered at the same benefit level as they were before. If you add other health coverage and become covered under an active employee health plan, that coverage will become the primary payer. Please note that you can only receive home delivery prescriptions through your primary prescription drug coverage's home delivery program. If AlaskaCare is now your primary coverage and you used to receive home delivery prescriptions through an alternate coverage, you will need to enroll in the AlaskaCare prescription home delivery program to continue to receive your medications by mail. Optum Rx provides the home delivery pharmacy for the AlaskaCare plans. Please visit Optum Rx.com or contact Optum Rx at [(855) 409-6999](tel:8554096999) to enroll in prescription home delivery. If you receive your medication through Optum Rx home delivery, your copay is $0, which may be less than the copay assessed by your other coverage. Please note that you cannot be enrolled in more than one EGWP at a time. We anticipate that this situation will be rare, but if you are already covered under an EGWP through a non-AlaskaCare plan, please provide the Division with a copy of your ID card from the other EGWP plan. We will disenroll you from the AlaskaCare EGWP but you will continue to receive the standard AlaskaCare pharmacy benefits. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) Eligibility and Enrollment Questions You can expect to receive information from Medicare three months prior to turning age 65, and though you should enroll in Medicare Part A and B, you do not need to enroll in an individual Medicare Part D plan. After you enroll in Medicare, you need to provide the Division your Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI - your Medicare number). [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#medicare) In most cases, no. The AlaskaCare retiree plan, through Optum Rx, will enroll eligible retirees into the AlaskaCare EGWP. AlaskaCare will pay a monthly administrative cost to the PBM for each enrolled member, and most retirees and their Medicare-eligible dependents will not be required to pay a premium to Medicare for Part D coverage. Medicare does require a premium payment (or surcharge) for individuals who are high-wage earners. This premium is referred to as the Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA). The Division reimburses members who are assessed an IRMAA for Part D coverage. [Learn more about IRMMA here.](https://drb.alaska.gov/help/faqs.html#irmaa) [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#medicare) Yes. If your spouse is eligible for Medicare and you are not, he/she will be enrolled in the AlaskaCare EGWP plan, while your coverage will continue to be provided the same way it is today. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#medicare) If your dependents are not currently Medicare-eligible, they will continue to receive prescription drug benefits the same way they do today. If one of your dependents becomes eligible for Medicare in the future, he or she would be enrolled in the AlaskaCare EGWP at that time. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#medicare) You cannot be enrolled in more than one EGWP at a time. We anticipate that this situation will be rare, but if you are already covered under an EGWP through a non-AlaskaCare plan, please provide the Division with a copy of your ID card from the other EGWP plan. We will disenroll you from the AlaskaCare EGWP but will you will continue to receive standard AlaskaCare pharmacy benefits. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) For most members, the benefit provided through your AlaskaCare retiree plan provides better value than an individual Medicare Part D plan. If you wish to keep your Individual Part D plan, you must opt out of the AlaskaCare EGWP plan. Retirees that opt-out of the AlaskaCare EGWP will be placed in a prescription drug program that is much different than the plan prescription drug benefits offered today. This may result in increased out-of-pocket expenses for you or your Medicare-eligible dependents. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#medicare) Please select the scenario that best describes you: - I am covered under a single AlaskaCare plan, and... - I am a retiree that is not eligible for Medicare: ID cards are issued in packs of two to retirees that are not eligible for Medicare. If you have an eligible dependent, you can share the extra card with your dependent. If you have more than one eligible dependent, you can request additional cards through Optum Rx at (855) 409-6999. Starting January 1, 2019, you can also print a temporary card from the Optum Rx portal, or use the Optum Rx mobile app. - I am a Medicare-eligible retiree who is not covered under the enhanced Employer Group Waiver Program (EGWP): ID cards are issued in packs of two to retirees that are not enrolled in the AlaskaCare enhanced Employer Group Waiver Program (EGWP). If you have an eligible dependent, you can share the extra card with your dependent. If you have more than one eligible dependent, you can request additional cards through Optum Rx at (855) 409-6999. Starting January 1st,1, 2019, you can also print a temporary card from the Optum Rx portal, or use the Optum Rx mobile app. - I am a retiree covered under the enhanced Employer Group Waiver Program (EGWP): You should have received only a single ID card with the MedicareRx logo in the lower right corner (see example below). Please contact the Division or Optum Rx for additional information on why you may have received a second card. - I am a retiree that is not eligible for Medicare: - I am covered under my own plan and under my spouse's AlaskaCare plan, and... - Both my spouse and I are either an active employee or a retiree not yet eligible for Medicare: You will both receive a two-pack of ID cards with your own name and ID number. You may share one copy of your ID card with your spouse, however, you or your dependents only need to present one of these ID cards to the pharmacy. Optum Rx coordinates your coverage behind the scenes. - Both my spouse and I are are retirees and eligible for Medicare: If you are both eligible for Medicare and are enrolled in the enhanced Employer Group Waiver Program (EGWP), you should each receive a single ID card that has the MedicareRx logo in the lower right (see example below). Each card will have an individual name and ID number. Although you receive only one card, when you present the card at the pharmacy you will receive the benefit of your double coverage under the plan. This means you will not be required to pay a copay at the pharmacy counter. - One of us is a Medicare-eligible retiree enrolled in the enhanced Employer Group Waiver Program (EGWP) and the other is either an active employee or a retiree not enrolled in EGWP: The retiree who is Medicare-eligible and is enrolled in the enhanced Employer Group Waiver Program (EGWP) will receive a single ID card that has the MedicareRx logo in the lower right (see example below). The card will have their individual name and ID number. Although they receive only one card, when they present the card at the pharmacy they will receive the benefit of having double coverage under the plan. This means they will not be required to pay a copay at the pharmacy counter. The spouse who is not enrolled in the EGWP will receive an ID card two-pack in their own name for each layer of coverage they have (their own coverage and their dependent coverage as the spouse of a Medicare-eligible retiree). The only difference between the two packs of ID cards will be the ID number. The ID number that matches the Medicare-eligible retiree's MedicareRx ID card will be the dependent coverage card. However, the spouse or other non-Medicare eligible dependents only need to present one of these ID cards to the pharmacy. Optum Rx coordinates the coverage behind the scenes. - Both my spouse and I are either an active employee or a retiree not yet eligible for Medicare: - I am covered under more than one of my own AlaskaCare plans, and... - I am eligible for Medicare: If you are eligible for Medicare and are enrolled in the enhanced Employer Group Waiver Program (EGWP), you should receive a single ID card that has the MedicareRx logo in the lower right (see example below). Although you receive only one card, when you present the card at the pharmacy you will receive the benefit of your double coverage under the plan. This means you will not be required to pay a copay at the pharmacy counter. - I am not eligible for Medicare: You will receive an ID card two-pack for each layer of coverage you have. The only difference between the different packs of ID cards will be the ID number. However, you only need to present one of these ID cards to the pharmacy. Optum Rx coordinates the coverage behind the scenes. Sample card: - I am eligible for Medicare: [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html#pharmacy) Optum Rx coordinates all the layers of coverage for you and your dependents behind the scenes, so in many cases you and your dependents can use each other's cards at the pharmacy. However, a non-EGWP dependent should not use the card that has a MedicareRx logo in the lower right corner. This card would only work if the pharmacist uses the correct person code (to identify them as a dependent rather than the policy holder). To avoid any confusion at the pharmacy, we recommend you and your dependents only use a card that has your name on it. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html#pharmacy) You can tell the difference between the cards by looking at the logo on the card. One will say AlaskaCare Employee Pharmacy Plan, and the other will say AlaskaCare Retiree Pharmacy Plan. Your employee plan will typically be the primary payer. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) You can opt out of the enhanced EGWP, but this is highly discouraged and will result in higher costs for both you and the health plan. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) require that you be given the opportunity to opt out of EGWP. Retirees that opt out of the AlaskaCare EGWP will be placed in a prescription drug program that is much different than the plan prescription drug benefits offered today. This will result in increased out-of-pocket expenses for you or your Medicare-eligible dependents. If you are considering opting out because you are covered under another Medicare plan (e.g. Medicare Advantage that includes prescription drug coverage or another EGWP), in lieu of opting out you can provide a copy of your Medicare Advantage or EGWP ID card to the Division and we will remove you from the enhanced EGWP and place you in the AlaskaCare standard pharmacy benefit plan. You can call the Division Monday through Thursday, 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. AKST toll-free at [(800) 821-2251](tel:8008212251) or email at . [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) If you are eligible for the enhanced EGWP and do not opt out, or if you are covered under another Medicare plan and contact the Division with evidence of that coverage, you will retain the Standard Benefit with the following provisions: |Standard Benefit| |Generic Up to you are eligible for the enhanced EGWP but choose to opt out, you will receive the opt-out benefit with the following provisions: |Opt-Out Benefit| coordination of benefits.| Remember: If you opt-out of the enhanced EGWP, you will be enrolled in a plan that is much different than the benefits offered today. This will result in increased out-of-pocket expenses for you or your Medicare-eligible dependents. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) Communication Questions You may receive letters or a phone call from Optum Rx asking to confirm certain personal information, including: your name, address, residential address, birthday, and Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (your Medicare ID number). Providing this information assists with expedited enrollment and helps avoid any potential issues related to discrepancies or errors between the health plan and Medicare. This is not a scam. If you need to provide updated information, you will receive reminder letters as follows: - First letter - upon enrollment in EGWP - Second letter - 30 days after enrollment - Third letter - 6 months after enrollment - Fourth letter - 12 months after enrollment. The fourth letter will be the final request to provide updated information. To provide this information, you can call the toll-free number provided in the letter, (855) 235-1405 (TTY 711), or mail the return form to: Optum Rx Attention: received an errata sheet from Optum Rx, you do not need to take any action; it is intended for informational purposes only. Because the AlaskaCare enhanced EGWP is a Medicare part D prescription drug plan, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) requires that we send out errata sheets to inform members of any corrections or clarifications we have made to the plan's abridged formulary, evidence of coverage, and summary of benefits. If you have any questions about any of the information on the errata sheet, please contact Optum Rx member services at [(855) 409-6999](tel:8554096999) (TTY 711). Please note that the AlaskaCare enhanced EGWP provides enhanced benefits beyond the Medicare Part D covered prescription drugs. Please refer to your AlaskaCare plan booklet to understand your full plan benefits. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#retireebooklets) Members who are enrolled in the enhanced Employer Group Waiver Program (EGWP) will receive a letter stating they have 21 days to opt-out of the EGWP. This is not a hard deadline. Members may elect to opt out of the enhanced EGWP at any time. Remember: If you opt out of the enhanced EGWP you will be enrolled in a plan that is much different than the benefits offered today. This will result in increased out-of-pocket expenses for you or your Medicare-eligible dependents. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (also called CMS or Medicare) requires that you maintain a residential (physical) address within the Medicare service area. A post office box does not qualify. The service area includes the United States, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands and America Samoa. We need you to confirm that you live inside the plan's service area. No mail will be sent to this physical address unless it is the same as your mailing address. It will only be used to verify that you live inside the plan's service area. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) We apologize for the tone of the letter, Medicare does not allow us to edit their required letters to add clarity. The intent of the statement in the letter is to emphasize that in order for AlaskaCare to continue to receive federal subsidies associated with your enrollment in EGWP, you must provide a residential address. You will not lose your coverage but if we do not receive your physical address, you will be disentrolled in the EGWP and placed in the AlaskaCare opt-out-plan. The opt-out plan may result in increased out-of-pocket expenses for you or your Medicare eligible dependents. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) You cannot be enrolled in more than one EGWP at a time. If you are already covered under an EGWP through a non-AlaskaCare plan, please contact the Division. We can dis-enroll you from the AlaskaCare EGWP and leave you in the plan available to non-Medicare-eligible members. You will receive a letter from AlaskaCare confirming that you have been removed from the AlaskaCare enhanced EGWP. Please share this letter with your other Medicare prescription drug plan. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) You cannot be enrolled in Medicare Advantage plan that includes prescription drug coverage and a separate EGWP plan at the same time. We anticipate that this situation will be rare, but if you are covered under a Medicare Advantage plan that includes prescription drug coverage, please provide the Division with a letter or copy of your Medicare Advantage card and we will disenroll you from the AlaskaCare EGWP. If you are disenrolled from the AlaskaCare EGWP, you will continue to receive pharmacy benefits through the standard AlaskaCare pharmacy benefit. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) Yes. The Part D surcharge deducted can be reimbursed through the Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) account. Each year, usually in November, Social Security will send you a letter which will state the IRMAA amount you are required to pay for the upcoming calendar year. To receive reimbursement, you have three options to choose from: - You may register/log in to the Optum Rx member portal; - You can use the Optum Rx mobile app; or - You can request a paper form to enroll in the Part D IRMAA Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA). Additional information can be found on our [IRMAA webpage](/retiree/healthplans.html#retireeirmaa). If you have any questions about how to submit your IRMAA documents and the Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA), please contact Optum Rx at [(855) 409-6999](tel:8554096999) or email .

[Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) The Late Enrollment Penalty is an amount added to the Medicare Part D plan premium for a member who meets one or both of the following criteria: - The member did not obtain creditable prescription drug (Rx) coverage when they were first eligible for Medicare Part D - The member had a break in creditable prescription drug (Rx) coverage of at least 63 consecutive days. The LEP, once assessed, remains with the member for the life of their participation in Medicare Part D. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) No, AlaskaCare will pay the Late Enrollment Penalty fee on behalf of the members. You are receiving a LEP letter since you were identified by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS or Medicare) as having uncovered months prior to their enrollment into the Medicare Part D plan. You may have had a LEP already in place under your former Medicare Part D plan. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) You can remove a LEP in the following ways: - You can call Optum Rx at the phone number on the back of your ID card and speak to an agent who will explain the process to remove the LEP. - You can complete the \"Declaration of Prior Prescription Drug Coverage\" form included with the LEP letter and mail it to the following address: Attn: Enrollment Services P.O. Box 269027 Fort Lauderdale, FL 33326 There is a limited amount of time to correct a LEP notice if you feel this has been applied in error. You must contact Optum RX no later than 30 days after receiving notification to complete an attestation and have the LEP removed.

[Visit Site](//OptumRx.com/public/landing) Initial Coverage State is a term used by Medicare and is part of the Medicare mandatory information sent to all Medicare prescription drug plan participants. However, due to the additional benefits provided through the AlaskaCare enhanced EGWP, this does not apply and will not impact your benefits. Your copay will not change. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html#pharmacy) The AlaskaCare retiree plan has what is called an \"open formulary.\" This means the AlaskaCare retiree plan will cover medications, even if those medications would typically not be covered under a Medicare prescription drug plan. AlaskaCare is required by the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to send a document called an \"abridged formulary\" to members in the AlaskaCare enhanced EGWP. This formulary provides a list of medications covered under Medicare Part D. Under the AlaskaCare enhanced EGWP, medications that are not typically covered under Medicare Part D will still be covered through the wrap benefit under the AlaskaCare enhanced EGWP. This means that your medication will remain covered even if it is not on the formulary. [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#retireeformulary) The COB Survey is a notification to a Medicare beneficiary that the Center for Medicare Services (CMS) has other primary or secondary coverage information on file for that member. Part D sponsors are required to notify each beneficiary of other prescription drug coverage information and request that the beneficiary review the information and report back any updates to Optum Rx. You will need to follow the instructions outlined in the COB letter to update the information with CMS by contacting Optum Rx. Members can update their information by contacting Optum Rx Enrollment Services and an enrollment agent will assist with completing the update over the phone. Optum Rx Enrollment Services [(855) 880-9199](tel:855-880-9199). In the event that other Primary coverage information is not updated timely, your prescription claims may reject at the pharmacy with a message to the pharmacy that there is alternative insurance coverage. To complete the COB survey, members should contact Optum Rx Enrollment Services at [(855) 880-9199](tel:855-880-9199). [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) Pre-Authorization and Appeals Questions If you are Medicare-eligible and are taking a medication that requires prior-authorization, you will receive a copy of the letter below. If you receive a letter referencing prior authorization that does not look like this, you may have received it in error. You can contact Optum Rx at [(855) 409-6999](tel:8554096999), TTY711 if you have questions about your prescriptions or any correspondence you have received from them. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) Here's what won't change: - Copayments will at $0 home delivery, $4 generic, $8 brand-name. - Covered medications will remain the same. - Filling prescriptions at the pharmacy will remain the same. - The value of your benefit will remain the same. - The current plan allows filling a prescription for 90 days or up to 100 units. This will not change. - The current appeals process will remain the same. You will not be required to use the federal appeals process. Here's what will be different: - You will receive several mandatory mailings from Optum Rx. - You will receive a separate monthly explanation of benefits of your prescription claims. - The pharmacy network will change. We don't believe these changes will substantially impact members, but you will want to check to be sure your preferred pharmacy is in-network. - Medicare has a list of drugs that require pre-authorization. These required prior authorizations do not include any \"step therapy\" requirements. (\"Step therapy\" is when an insurance plan requires a member to try certain lower-cost medications first before covering a more expensive type of medication.) You may have to get a prior authorization for drugs where it was not previously required or seek prior authorization for drugs that have already been preauthorized under the current plan. - If you have multiple medical conditions and high drug-utilization, you may be enrolled in the Medicare Medication Therapy Management Program by the State. Medicare developed this program as a member protection. This program helps you and your doctor make sure that your medications are working to improve your health and provides a comprehensive review that includes: how your medications are working; if they have side effects; and any interactions between drugs you are taking. You can opt out of this program. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) The current appeals process will remain the same. You will not be required to use the federal appeals process. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) Yes. A full list of covered drugs is available on the AlaskaCare Optum Rx web page. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) No. Your provider can prescribe whatever medication they think is most appropriate for you and your co-pay will be $0 for home delivery, $4 for generic medications, and $8 for a brand-name medication. Depending on what your provider prescribes, the medication may require prior authorization. All claims, not just prescription drug claims, must be medically necessary in order to be covered by the health plan. Determinations of medical necessity are part of the claims processing function for all health care plans and can be complex depending on the situation. AlaskaCare relies on our Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) to make evidence-based decisions on medical necessity as part of the pharmacy claims processing function, and this process will continue under an AlaskaCare EGWP. There may be instances in which a member's provider will disagree with coverage decisions related to medical necessity. In these cases, we encourage members to utilize the appeal process for reconsideration. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) Information for High Income Earners Certain high-income retirees will have to pay an extra surcharge, consistent with the extra surcharge applied to Medicare Part B today. Generally, if you are an individual earning more than $85,000 per year or a married couple who earns more than $170,000 per year, you will be charged an extra premium for being enrolled in an AlaskaCare EGWP because it is a group Medicare Part D plan. CMS refers to this as Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts (IRMAA). If you are charged an IRMAA for your prescription drug coverage, the Division will cover the full cost of the premium. Contact the Division to learn about your options. Similar to Medicare Part B, the IRMAA premium amount will be deducted directly from your Social Security check if you qualify for Social Security or will otherwise be invoiced to you directly. The Social Security Administration (SSA) will send you a letter with your IRMAA premium amount and the reason for the determination. If you disagree with the IRMAA premium amount or your income has gone down, you should contact Social Security at (800) 772-1213 to resolve the determination. The Social Security Administration will use your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) to determine if the income-related monthly adjustment amount (IRMAA) applies. MAGI is the sum of: - Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), which can be found on the last line your IRS 1040 tax form (line 37 on form 1040, line 21 on form 1040A, or line 4 on form 1040EZ), plus: - Any tax-exempt interest income (line 8b on form 1040). To make this determination, SSA requests income information from the IRS for the tax year that is two years prior to the premium year. For example, Social Security will use your MAGI from 2017 to determine your 2019 IRMAA. IRMAA is automatically re-determined each year as long as you file an income tax return. The table below shows the anticipated IRMAA for and is for illustrative purposes only. The MAGI and IRMAA are subject to change. |Individual Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)||Household Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)||Monthly Part D IRMAA Surcharge| |Less than or equal to $91,000||Less than or equal to $182,000||Not assessed a surcharge| |Greater than $91,000 and less than or equal to $114,000||Greater than $182,000 and less than or equal to $228,000||$12.40| |Greater than $114,000 and less than or equal to $142,000||Greater than $228,000 and less than or equal to $284,000||$32.10| |Greater than $142,000 and less than or equal to $170,000||Greater than $284,000 and less than or equal to $340,000||$51.70| |Greater than $170,000 and less than or equal to $500,000||Greater than $340,000 and less than or equal to $750,000||$71.30| |Greater than $500,000||Greater than $750,000||$77.90|[Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) The Division is prohibited from paying your Medicare Part D IRMAA premium surcharge directly and will instead reimburse you. If you receive notice that you are required to pay the IRMAA surcharge for the enhanced EGWP, follow the steps outlined in question 74 to request reimbursement. The Division will fund a tax advantaged HRA account that can be used to reimburse you the Part D IRMAA surcharge amount by paper check or through electronic funds transfer to a bank account of your choosing. [Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) If you refuse to pay the extra surcharge, Medicare will cancel your enrollment in the AlaskaCare enhanced EGWP plan. This will be treated as an opt-out under the plan, and you will be placed in a prescription drug program that is much different than the plan prescription drug benefits offered today.

[Learn More](/retiree/egwplan.html) Each year, if you are Medicare-eligible, you will be notified by the Social Security Administration about your plan. This includes if you are required to pay an IRMAA and at what amount. The Social Security Administration uses your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) to determine if the IRMAA applies to you and, if so, how much you will have to pay. MAGI is the sum of: - Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), which can be found on the last line your IRS 1040 tax form (line 37 on form 1040, line 21 on form 1040A, or line 4 on form 1040EZ), plus - Any tax-exempt interest income (line 8b on form 1040). The Social Security Administration requests income information from the IRS for the tax year that is two years prior to the surcharge year. IRMAA is automatically re-determined each year as long as you file an income tax return. The below table shows the IRMAA for 2023. The MAGI and IRMAA is subject to change from year to year. Please review the table below to see if your income qualifies you to be assessed an IRMAA surcharge based on your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) from the 2021 tax year. |2023 Part D IRMAA Amounts| |If your filing status and yearly income in 2021 was...| |File individual tax return||File joint tax return||File married & separate tax return||You pay each month (in 2023)| |Less than or equal to $97,000||Less than or equal to $194,000||Less than or equal to $97,000||Not assessed a surcharge| |Greater than $97,000 and less than or equal to $123,000||Greater than $194,000 and less than or equal to $246,000||Not applicable||$12.20| |Greater than $123,000 and less than or equal to $153,000||Greater than $246,000 and less than or equal to $306,000||Not Applicable||$31.50| |Greater than $153,000 and less than or equal to $183,000||Greater than $306,000 and less than or equal to $366,000||Not applicable||$50.70| |Greater than $183,000 and less than or equal to $500,000||Greater than $366,000 and less than or equal to $750,000||Greater than $97,000 and less than or equal to $403,000||$70.00| |Greater than $500,000 or above||Greater than $750,000 or additional [Learn More](/retiree/healthplans.html#retireeirmaa) Optum Rx will handle all your IRMAA needs.

If there is no such agreement, the recognized charge is determined in accordance with the provisions of this section. Except for charges related to involuntary out-of-network services, an out-of-network provider has the right to bill the difference between the recognized charge and the actual charge. This difference will be the covered person's responsibility. Medical Expenses: As to medical services or supplies, the recognized charge for each service or supply is the lesser of: - What the provider bills or submits for that service or supply; - Or the 90th percentile of the prevailing charge rate; for the geographic area where the service is furnished as determined by Aetna in accordance with Aetna reimbursement policies. For more information on recognized charge in the Retiree Plan, see the [Retiree Insurance Information Booklet](/docs/booklets/DB-RetireeInsuranceBooklet_WEB.pdf) , section 3.1.4 Recognized Charge. Coordination of Benefits (COB) is a method of paying claims when you or your covered dependent have more than one health coverage plan. The AlaskaCare health plans coordinate benefits with other group health care plans to which you or your covered dependents belong. Coordination of benefits can be very confusing, even for people who work at a physician's office. With COB, if you are covered by more than one health care plan, the plans work together to provide benefits. One plan is considered \"primary,\" and pays your covered expenses first. The other plan is \"secondary,\" and depending on the plans COB provisions, may pay a portion or may pay any remaining covered expenses up to 100%. In some cases, there may be a third or fourth plan, as well. It is important to remember that not all expenses are covered expenses. In addition, each plan may have their own separate deductibles that may have to be satisfied independent of each other. The plans will likely also have independent and different copayments, coinsurance rates and annual out-of-pocket limits. Here are examples of common COB situations and rules: |If You Are Covered Under...||Here's How the Plans Pay| |Active employee plan and retiree plan||Primary: Active employee plan | Secondary: Retiree plan |Retiree plan and as dependent under another person's plan through active employment||Primary: Retiree plan | Secondary: Other person's plan |Retiree plan and Medicare-eligible||Primary: Medicare | Secondary: Retiree plan |Two retiree plans||Primary: Plan in force the longest | Secondary: Other plan |Retiree plan, as dependent under another person's plan through active employment, and Medicare-eligible||Primary: Other person's plan | Secondary: Medicare Third: Retiree plan |Active employee plan, retiree plan, as dependent under another person's plan through active employment, and Medicare-eligible||Primary: Active employee plan | Secondary: Other person's plan Third: Medicare Fourth: Retiree plan If your dependent children are covered under more than one plan, in most cases, the plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the year (not the oldest) is primary. If both parents have the same birthday, the plan that has covered the children longer is primary. If the parents are separated or divorced, the plans pay as follows: - Primary: plan of the parent whom the court has established as financially responsible for the child's health care (the claims administrator must be informed of the court decree) - Secondary: plan of the parent with custody of the child - Third: plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child - Fourth: plan of the parent who does not have custody of the child If none of the above rules applies, the plan that has covered the patient the longest is primary. The AlaskaCare Retiree Dental, Vision, Audio (DVA) Plan for DCR Plan Retirees coordinates benefits differently than the medical plan does when it is secondary to another plan. For DVA services, the amount the plan pays after the deductible is met is figured by subtracting what the primary plan pays from 100% of expenses covered by the AlaskaCare plan on that claim. Example: - You obtain a filling from a network dentist who charges $200. - Both your dental plans pay 80% for class II (restorative) services. - You have met your deductibles for the year. - Primary plan pays: $160 (80% of $200) - $200) - Total paid: $200 For medical services, when the AlaskaCare plan is secondary on a claim the plan will reduce the allowable amount by the amount paid by the primary plan, before applying the deductible, copays and/or coinsurance. The allowable amount is the total amount the AlaskaCare plan is responsible for, before any member cost share provision is applied. Example: - You are Medicare age eligible and obtain a service from a provider who accepts Medicare. The Medicare allowed rate for the service is $1,500. - Both Medicare and the AlaskaCare plan pay 80% for the covered service. - You have not met either your Medicare or AlaskaCare deductible for the year. - Medicare as primary plan pays: $1,067.20 ($1,500-$166 Medicare deductible = $1,334x80% is - $300 deductible = $132.80x80% is $106.24) - Total paid by both plans: $1,173.44. - Unpaid portion ($326.56) applies to the annual individual out-of-pocket maximum. No. Under the medical plan, the allowable amount on the second AlaskaCare plan will be reduced by the amount paid under the primary plan (see above example). You may also receive a balance bill for the amount over the recognized charge allowed under the primary plan if you receive services from an out-of-network provider. Example: - You are not yet Medicare age eligible and obtain a service from an out-of-network provider who charges $500 for a procedure. - The recognized charge for the procedure is $425. - Both AlaskaCare plans pay 80% for the covered service. - You have met your annual deductibles. - The primary plan pays: $340 ($425x80% is $340) - The secondary plan bases payment on: $85 ($425-$340 paid by primary plan) - The plan pays as secondary: $68 ($85x80% is $68) - Total paid by both plans: $408. - Unpaid portion that you may be responsible for is $92. This is the difference between the billed amount and the allowable recognized charge ($75), plus your coinsurance ($17). Your coinsurance amount ($17) will apply towards the annual individual out-of-pocket maximum. You may also receive a balance bill if you use an out-of-network provider for dental services. In this case, the plan will pay up to the recognized charge for this service in your area. Example: - You obtain a filling from an out-of-network dentist who charges $250 for a filling. - The recognized charge for this service in Alaska is $150. - Both your plans pay 80% for class II (restorative) services. - You have met your deductibles for the year. - Primary plan pays: $120 (80% of $150) - bill amount: $100 ($250 - $150) You may also receive a balance bill if one of your plans has a lower coinsurance rate (the percentage of the cost you pay for covered expenses once you meet any deductible) or excludes coverage for the service. Example: - You obtain a filling from a dental network provider who charges $200. - Your dental plan pays 80% for class II (restorative) services, but your spouse's plan only pays 10%. - You have met your deductibles for the year. - Primary plan pays: $160 (80% of $200) - bill amount: $20 ($200 - $180) For more information on how recognized charges are calculated, see the [Recognized Charges FAQs](#retireedcr03). If you are covered under two AlaskaCare plans, the annual maximum that the plan pays will double. For example, under the Alaska care retiree dental plan, the annual $2,000 individual maximum would double to $4,000. No, the maximum frequency of services per year is not increased due to having other coverage. For example, if you have two plans that each cover up to 20 spinal manipulations each year, the plan will coordinate payment on only 20 manipulations. Manipulations in excess of 20 would not be covered under either plan. If you are covered under AlaskaCare and age eligible for Medicare, your claims will be processed as if Medicare is your primary coverage regardless of whether or not you actually have Medicare coverage. This means that the AlaskaCare plan reduces the allowable amount it will pay by the amount that would have been paid under Medicare Parts A and B, regardless of whether you actually have Medicare. It's your responsibility to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B as soon as you become eligible and to pay applicable Medicare premiums. Because the AlaskaCare enhanced EGWP is a group Medicare Part D plan, if you have multiple prescription drug coverages the AlaskaCare enhanced EGWP will become the primary payer. If your other coverage previously had been the primary payer, it will move into the secondary payer position. Your total coverage levels will not change. Your medications will still be covered at the same benefit level as they were before. Please note that you can only receive mail-order prescriptions through your primary prescription drug coverage's home delivery program. If AlaskaCare is now your primary coverage and you used to receive mail-order prescriptions through an alternate coverage, you will need to enroll in the AlaskaCare prescription home delivery program to continue to receive your medications by mail. Optum Rx provides the mail-order pharmacy for the AlaskaCare plans. [Optum Rx.com](https://www.OptumRx.com/public/landing) or contact Optum Rx at [(855) 409-6999](tel:8554096999) to enroll in prescription home delivery. If you receive your medication through Optum Rx home delivery, your copay is $0, which may be less than the copay assessed by your other coverage. Please note that you cannot be enrolled in more than one EGWP at a time. We anticipate that this situation will be rare, but if you are already covered under an EGWP through a non-AlaskaCare plan, please provide the Division with a copy of your ID card from the other EGWP plan. We will disenroll you from the AlaskaCare EGWP but will you will continue to receive standard AlaskaCare pharmacy benefits.

The type of retirement you elected is irrevocable. - Regular Retirement: All benefits cease at the time of your death, including health insurance. - Beneficiary payment: Your beneficary(s) will receive the balance of your member contribution account, if any, or the last pension check. If you die after you have retired, your beneficiary is entitled to the benefit check for the month in which you died, if it was not already paid to you. Any check payable to you dated after you die, will need to be returned to the Division to be reissued in the name of your beneficiary(s). - Level Income Option (not available for PERS Tier III): If you chose this option you will receive an increased benefit amount prior to age 65, and a decreased amount beginning at age 65. If you chose this benefit option you must anticipate other retirement resources to commence at age 65 in order to provide approximately the same income.

Although the proposed regulations have not been finalized, governmental plan sponsors may rely on them until the issuance of final regulations. The Division has conferred with its outside tax counsel and confirmed that to avoid potential early distribution tax penalties for our members and to avoid a risk of disqualification of our plans, retirees must clearly demonstrate a valid severance from employment with the participating employer before returning to any type of employment with the same employer. While the Division of Retirement and Benefits (DRB) has required a minimum 30-60 day break-in-service period since 2005, the establishment of a federal normal retirement age of 62 to determine when an employee receives an in-service distribution has required a new policy to be adopted.

In addition, members under age 62 must observe a six month break in service before reemployment in any capacity can occur with the same employer. Members age 62 or older must observe a 60 day break in service before reemployment in any capacity with the same employer. Retiring members must certify on their retirement application, under penalty of fraud, that no prearrangement for employment exists. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) Yes. Clarification received from tax counsel indicates the summer break period can be used when calculating the number of months from the member's retirement date to satisfy the break in service requirements for retirees from school district employers. For example, a teacher retiring on July 1 who is under age 62 would be able to return to non-TRS employment with the same employer on January 1st. A teacher retiring on July 1 who is age 62 or older would be able to return to non-TRS employment with the same employer on September 1st. Reemployment in any capacity includes but is not limited to employment as a part-time, temporary, contract, or leased employee or as an independent contractor or any fee-for-service arrangement. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) The requirement for no prearrangement for reemployment has been in effect since 2005. If an employee does not sever the employer-employee relationship by having a break in service of 60 days before returning to employment, their termination of employment date is considered invalid and they are not eligible for retirement benefits. The extended requirements for a break-in-service equaling six (6) months will become effective when the regulations have been adopted. This is estimated to be by January 1, 2018. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) As previously stated, the requirement for a valid termination is currently in effect. The increased break-in-service requirement of six (6) months for members under age 62 will be applied to retirees rehired after January 1, 2018. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) The Division will administer the regulations prospectively for retirees rehired after the effective date and no retroactive action will be taken. However, the returned retiree is still subject to the requirement for a bona fide separation from service before receiving a retirement benefit. Should an IRS review of the retiree occur, a facts and circumstances review may be done and a final determination will be made by the IRS. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) A retiree who returns to work with the same employer, without the required separation of service period, would have a violation of the return to work limitation regardless of whether the retiree was returning to work in a full-time, part-time or temporary position, or if the retiree is returning as a leased employer or an independent contractor. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) Yes. The policy applies to all employment with the employer and would include substitute teaching on an on-call or incidental basis. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) Yes. There is a \"window of correction\" period for correcting ineligible hires. The employer must determine if a retiree is eligible for rehire before the hire is made. If it is later discovered the employee is not eligible, the employer may make corrections and back the hire out of their system during the first pay period. Members who are still employed after the first pay period who have not served the break in service requirements will be deemed to be in violation or the rehire policy. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) The Division will first do a facts and circumstances review to determine if a prearrangement for reemployment was made prior to the member's retirement date. This will require certification from the employer to the facts and circumstances of rehire. If a prearrangement for rehire was in effect, the member will be deemed to not have had a valid termination of employment and must repay the Division the full amount of retirement benefits received since the effective date of their retirement. If no prearrangement for rehire was in effect and the member is under age 62, the Division will be required to code the member's retirement benefits retroactively to date of retirement (or to January 1, 2018 whichever is later) as an early distribution and a 10% tax penalty will be levied by the IRS for an early distribution of retirement benefits. Retirement benefits will be stopped as of the date of re-hire. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) No. The key to this requirement is whether the employee/employer relationship has been severed, not what retirement plan the member participates in. An employee must still observe the six (6) month break-in-service period before rehire with the same employer. The fact that the employee would be a member of a different retirement system before and after the return to work is irrelevant to the requirement. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) Yes. In order for the IRS to consider an employee to be \"retired,\" the IRS requires an employee to have a bona fide separation from service with the employee's employer. Therefore, based upon this example, a State PERS employee could retire on July 1 and immediately commence non-covered employment with a local government, even though the local government also is a PERS employer. The requirements refer to employment with the same employer only. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) No. A State PERS employee could not retire from one department of the State and then begin work with another department of the State without fulfilling the six (6) month break in service. The reason for this is because all departments and branches of the State are considered to be part of the same employer - e.g. the State of Alaska. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) The requirements for bona fide termination apply to both PERS/TRS defined benefit and defined contribution plans. There can be no pre-arrangement for reemployment with the same employer prior to termination of employment. If a PERS/TRS DCR Plan member terminates employment and withdraws their funds, they will automatically pay the 10% early withdrawal penalty if they are under age 59 \u00bd per the defined contribution plan rules. PERS/TRS DCR Plan members must be terminated from employment for 60 days before their funds can be disbursed as part of the current plan rules. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) To protect the prospective employee, you can tell them that if they are a retiree and have been for less than six months to contact the Division of Retirement and Benefits to be sure they can accept employment without consequence. As the employer, your responsibility is to not have a prearrangement for retirement and to caution prospective employees about the rehire rules. Employers may also contact the division to determine eligibility for rehire. Most employer payroll staff should be aware of their own employees who have recently retired and are now back to work with the same employer. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) No. Since they have only changed retirement systems and have not terminated employment with the employer, they will not be able to draw their PERS benefits while continuing employment. They will be eligible to draw your PERS benefits only when they actually terminate employment. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) You need to immediately notify our Pension Adjustments section in the Division of Retirement and Benefits. If we are notified in a timely manner, we can prevent overpayment of benefits. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) If this is a temporary (nonpermanent) position in which you are not making contributions or accruing PERS service, you are not required to notify us. You will continue to receive your retirement benefit as before. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) If you come back to work, you will not lose your tier. If you return to work in a permanent full-time or part-time position in the PERS, you will accrue service under your original tier. [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) If you to return to work in a permanent full-time or part-time position in the PERS: - Your retirement benefit will stop during your reemployment - You will make contributions to PERS once again - You will accrue PERS service toward a second retirement benefit [Learn More](/employer/return2work.html) If you retired under a RIP, your retirement will be recalculated to exclude your RIP credit and you will owe the PERS 110% or 150% of the benefits you received as a result of the program, including any costs for health insurance. An indebtedness will be established for what you owe and will be reduced by the amount that you paid to participate in the RIP. There are some exceptions for RIP retirees, but they are very specific and narrowly defined.
