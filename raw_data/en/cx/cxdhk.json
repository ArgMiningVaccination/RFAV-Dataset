Despite this, Ayurveda has been denied adequate acknowledgement and respect. One of the primary objections is the usage of antiquated language and phrases that do not correspond to contemporary scientific terms that one is usually acquainted with. This, added to the fact that Ayurveda's views and techniques to health and illness differ greatly from those of conventional medicine, has caused some to ask if Ayurveda is yet another Indian enigma. There are plenty of Health Benefits of Ayurveda Over Modern Medicine which will be discussed here. Millions of lives have been saved as a result of modern medicine, which has been established as the best choice in cases of trauma and serious sickness. However, it frequently has side effects and does not address the underlying cause of the disease. Ayurveda, on the other hand, is more concerned with treating the disease and the body overall, rather than simply the symptoms. The ancient medical system is founded on the premise that health is a good condition or state that may be reached by adhering to the Yamas (social constraints) and Niyamas (dietary restrictions) (self-disciplines). Ayurveda encourages us to allow these ethical values to influence our interactions with others and how we care for our bodies. When you improve your health, you may notice that most of your symptoms will go away without needing to be handled directly. Ayurveda can assist us in attaining total equilibrium on all levels of the mind, body, and spirit. Although modern medicine is necessary and life-saving, the remedies might be unsatisfying to the body and senses at times. In such circumstances, Ayurveda can provide a remedy to all of these issues. The fundamental advantage of Ayurvedic therapy is that there are no side effects since Ayurvedic remedies are made from the essence of fruits, spices, vegetables, and natural herbs. These natural components aid in the treatment of ailments while posing no additional risks. However, utilising Allopathy drugs might cause hair loss, weakness, and allergies. The ayurvedic treatment approach may not be quick, but it is extremely successful, as opposed to allopathic treatment, which cures the ailment quickly but creates numerous side effects and is comparatively less efficient in the long-term cure. Despite being a more contemporary and advanced medical treatment approach, allopathy is still unable to heal ailments such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, jaundice, and so on. However, Ayurveda has effectively treated and managed these disorders from ancient times. Allopathic treatments only partly cleanse our bodies, however Ayurvedic remedies and medicines assist to decontaminate and cleanse our bodies completely. Unlike allopathic medications, Ayurvedic remedies are environmentally friendly since they are made from organic ingredients. Allopathic medications are made using chemicals, which pollute the environment. Another advantage of Ayurvedic products is that they are very inexpensive because they are typically made from widely available herbs and plants. Ayurveda considers an organism to be a system of interactions that determine the functions rather than a set of organs. As a result, Ayurveda's knowledge of how the human body works is different from that of clinical medicine. It is based on the Tridoshas, which are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These terms in Sanskrit, the language of Ayurveda, allude to functions such as movement, change, and support and growth. These are referred to as 'doshas' in Ayurveda, which literally means 'that which can become vitiated.' This is appropriate because, in the end, it is the functions that are hindered in a disease. The existence or absence of a balanced condition of the overall body matrix, including the equilibrium between its many parts, determines health or disease. Both intrinsic and external causes can disrupt the natural equilibrium, resulting in illness. This lack of balance can be caused by indiscriminate eating, bad behaviours, and a failure to follow healthy living principles. Seasonal changes, poor exercise or inconsistent use of sense organs, and incompatible acts of the body and mind can all disrupt the body's and mind's natural equilibrium. The treatment consists of restoring the equilibrium of the damaged body-mind matrix by diet regulation, life-routine and behaviour correction, pharmacological administration, and the use of preventative Panchkarma and Rasayana therapy. In conclusion, Ayurveda is an ancient proven method to treat the mind, body and spirit alike when healing. It can help work wonders with a little patience and faith.
