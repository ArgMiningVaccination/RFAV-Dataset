Frequently asked questions IIN pioneered the field of health coaching.

IIN is licensed by the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools, which entails constant oversight as well as periodic review and renewal of our courses and curricula. We're incredibly proud of this licensure as we aim to be held to the highest standards, which underscores credibility, trust, and value in the education you earn. Today, we are taking strategic steps to support our evolution from health coaching school to the world's largest integrative health education and certification platform. This means forging important partnerships that allow us to expand our reach and provide our community members with even more opportunities to thrive in their personal and professional lives. The first such partnership is with [Dr. Deepak Chopra and Chopra Global (Chopra)](/chopra-announcement), bringing Dr. Chopra on as IIN chief wellness officer and adding Chopra courses to the IIN portfolio, including courses on meditation, Ayurveda, yoga, and coaching. Using their nutrition, holistic health, and coaching education, Health Coaches help their clients discover which foods and lifestyle choices make them feel best. Most importantly, Health Coaches take a holistic approach to health, focusing not just on food but also all the other areas of life that can support and nourish overall health, such as career, spirituality, relationships, and environment. Health Coaches can work with clients one-on-one, in group settings, or alongside healthcare professionals, such as medical doctors, chiropractors, therapists, and nurses, as well as other professionals in wellness, such as personal trainers, registered dietitians, and nutritionists. Health Coaches play a pivotal role in the greater healthcare team, filling the void often left by doctors who don't necessarily have time to provide nutrition and coaching guidance. Health Coaches are changing the world and reversing the global healthcare crisis as one of the quickest-growing careers.
