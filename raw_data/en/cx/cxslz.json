Excludes gift vouchers Hi. I am interested to find out which crystals are good for cooling the liver. I have a feeling Bloodstone is good for cleansing the blood, but that might not mean cooling the blood. which actually means if you are trying to treat fiery overactive and stagnant liver qi, then bloodstone might just aggravate the problem. It might just push for elimination of toxins, which might be hard to do for a liver that is not moving efficiently. The other crystal that would be necessary when clearing liver heat. would be a stone to strengthen the kidney. Can you also suggest any crystals that strengthen the kidney and would be good to use in conjunction with clearing liver qi?. Thanks. I look foreward to hearing from you. Dear S, Thank you for your question. At the moment, and as far as I know, there is only one book on this topic-- Healing Stones for the Vital Organs: 83 Crystals with Traditional Chinese Medicine, by two German authors, both esteemed and long-established crystal healing and Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners, Michael Gienger and Wolfgang Maier. While the book is made for general audience, and therefore does not offer detailed prescriptions for every TCM symptom, it does suggest several crystals that are beneficial for regulating the functions of each of the twelve major organ systems. I would recommend that you get the book and in the meantime I'll briefly present a list of crystals beneficial for the issues you are interested in: for balancing the Liver (and these are also cooling stones) (he mentions more crystals, but the other ones may have additional properties that might be too strong for some people) Your intuition was correct in regards to [Bloodstone](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-bloodstone-stone.html?sort_view=stone)(Heliotrope), as that stone is stimulating for the Liver and is also a great stone for stimulating the Gallbladder. It is best to use them during the times when Liver is the strongest and weakest, based on the Traditional Chinese Medicine Organ Clock. Nephrite (a type of Jade) is traditionally recommended for Kidneys in most healing crystals sources, as well in traditional Chinese culture, and also by these authors as an excellent stone for strengthening the Kidneys. While they mention additional stones, I would recommend only this one for the combination of things that you described. I hope that these recommendations can be of assistance and that crystals grace your journey with love and light. Crystal Blessings!
