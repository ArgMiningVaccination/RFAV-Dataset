It's about spending two days with the oldest dog in the world, Bobi, and his remarkable family. When I received the invitation to attend the birthday party of the world's oldest dog, I was initially a bit uncertain. I had previously committed to visiting my friend and fellow dog lover, Michelle, and her family, in the UK. However, understanding the unique opportunity, she graciously agreed to reschedule our meeting. So, I found myself on a flight to Lisbon, Portugal, filled with excitement and anticipation. I had no idea what to expect. I only knew I would join my dear friends, Dr. Karen Becker and Rodney Habib, and drive to a small village near Leiria, Portugal. Meeting Bobi and his family Intentionally, I didn't research any information about Bobi's family to make the meeting more of a surprise. Entering the farm gate, we walked through fresh-cut grass and aromatic rosemary branches that Bobi's dad, Leonel, spread around. The scent was lovely. In the courtyard, Bobi, the guest of honor, greeted us. Despite his advanced age and slower pace, his eyes sparkled with life, extending us and Pax a warm, silent welcome. I saw a quiet understanding pass between them as if Bobi said: \"I am ready to pass on all I have learned to you so that you can share my wisdom further.\" Pax is now four years old, which means Bobi has lived almost eight times as long as him! Before the official birthday event began, they treated us to a traditional Portuguese lunch with dark bread, fresh salad, Dorado, and sardines barbecued to perfection. A refreshing fruit salad made of orange, peach, and cantaloupe melon completed the meal. As the other guests began to arrive \u2014 a group of approximately one hundred people, including eighty from the media \u2014 the event's significance truly hit me. How crazy that Pax and I were among the few lucky people to celebrate the birthday of the world's oldest dog! Yet, the atmosphere was beautifully simple and unpretentious. Even the media personnel, often known for their intrusive presence, seamlessly blended in. The simplicity of the day was such a pleasant surprise. Amidst a world where grandeur often overshadows authenticity, this event was different. Maybe Bobi, Leonel, and Donna Maria's energy transformed everyone. I'm not typically a fan of big gatherings, but this one felt very special. As the celebration rolled on, Bobi seemed to follow Pax frequently. Like a wise teacher insisting on his student learning the ropes, while Pax, the restless pup, was busy sniffing out food dropped from the grill. Photo credit Dr. Karen Becker You may be wondering: What does Bobi eat? Does he see a vet? How long is he expected to live? Why isn't he gray? Is he neutered? Is this all true? Some skeptics suggest Bobi is a hoax, but that's not the case. His age has been verified by telomere testing and a review of his medical records by Guinness World Records. As for his diet, Bobi eats a mix of raw and cooked meat and fish, combined with primarily raw organic vegetables from the garden. Leonel told me they never buy produce from the store. Instead, everything they need grows in their garden, or if the neighbours are willing to trade! To my surprise, Bobi also eats cooked onions without any ill effects, despite the fact that we've all been told that it can cause hemolytic anemia in dogs. Well, go figure! Vet care and no gray hair? Bobi does have a few vets looking after him. He was in excellent health; unfortunately, he was treated with Bravecto a few years ago due to fleas, and that is when his head tilt appeared. As to why Bobi isn't gray, he likely carries a gene that prevents graying. His longevity is most likely a mix of healthy food, plenty of social interaction, and good genes. Despite all this, Leonel and his mother, Donna Maria, remained patient, protective, and clear about their boundaries. On Sunday, I talked to Leonel about how unprepared he feels for when Bobi won't be around anymore. I understand him well and know that you, my dear readers, do too. Leonel's openness touched me. We're all scared of the moment our dogs won't be with us anymore. All we can do is keep seeking, researching, and discussing ways to prolong their healthy lives. I admire Leonel because, despite his and Bobi's fame, he lives a simple life in his humble farmhouse in a small village in Portugal. His openness and hospitality to us and others are undoubtedly genuine and sincere. Before leaving, we discussed Bobi's care, particularly his mobility and a small open growth by his rear end. I suggested increasing his [Omega-3 ](https://trk.klclick2.com/ls/click?upn=BaHi2h0s0sANCNc-2BczIyVholQPAPRtvvSAzTpYT-2F0zFqT6kq8fIUx85wAoPvUUm8pvaV-2BNd-2F8yOVxfjIw3kcV0Po-2BZPN4EJSfHKuIfOmB4ecY3Mtjd2nYk8rbVdx21Dbnwg-2Fa5yPnWKBmlF13Pcf6wzbFd6eDVi3gwC-2BDihPnLec3634-2BISxFsxvSIfZaps-2BN6H18l6qzNyGzVecOPVfIsr-2Be5Q0DrXSZXblOJabCJ5-2BJwQzhz6-2BygVdL-2FmvubYx69qQ_6L-2B-2FTip3GiktzTmSNB0oPwcYqxG4Th-2F8VEify2uxUxOb-2FMXJ8H9PhiHXPmBdO4XFBq4jzQwC-2Bdh5nexJXcSFe3HwbLEJA-2BrOTTqHDF8CZNIdecy8VpuXys-2Fb5K9h9V75FKd5OLxCKUYj8tM4kvLfhClZlBERwVtSIrk0-2FQEvRXfGWa3CYy-2BroCHts-2FRp32E4O-2FzQ4doNQJ-2FCkCrAR7xoWIMw4cobTOPc1sS7hsZNNlAFD-2Fqz4HeDW9UkGylqekNyL0E21dx1JBr4UaD6EJsCGXleEB6CtCNO-2Fg9EhEvmKbk-3D)intake and shared my experience with [natural wound care](https://trk.klclick2.com/ls/click?upn=BaHi2h0s0sANCNc-2BczIyVholQPAPRtvvSAzTpYT-2F0zHsXt6VC2eid5fmufWPXkLsz21ydYCO7-2FqlsKr-2FaaJsHruqk1FxRtwUGbGWy-2FB-2FyYzdYYIp0ti0swM3Oyur83OivioLdLCGQUsjnGWnAmWun-2F1h-2FDCyY3fyc489bROx1peStDW1dx-2BPCCm5VcheYYFzAVwPEiEXQu5e9kWNcXDB8QHyYYeuaXBaUnK8IkwaXJkMvqg6oryR4BF5PYesr6Hnh2oNIjmmXgTEZK904ByvqPxpjYEF2rkZE-2B0eoU33KY0-3DKO1c_6L-2B-2FTip3GiktzTmSNB0oPwcYqxG4Th-2F8VEify2uxUxOb-2FMXJ8H9PhiHXPmBdO4XFBq4jzQwC-2Bdh5nexJXcSFe3HwbLEJA-2BrOTTqHDF8CZNLpEn9GnE7KfENXGmfZhDTOXkwI-2F33PwdAtTWCUsAM4bfQ-2F-2FM2KviCrXcxDMpRHRt2q3AM5ArudJYjxfgT7W26re1l2PZVhCA2ukXL6U-2Fjnx4FyUaSEXiVuc7q-2Bm1-2FZc93kv7fgsU6pkOEnE-2Fn-2BvZ8rhBOMZvkON5c6VPf69pjVzuBnO-2FS-2F-2BKZRbRxjje25dIo-3D). After my return from Portugal, I was moved by your responses to Bobi's story. Setting up a \"Bobi and Leonel's Gratitude Fund\" seemed the perfect way to show our appreciation. However, life has a way of surprising us. Just when I launched the fundraiser on GoFundMe, I spoke to Leonel, Bobi's owner, who graciously insisted that he would not accept any money despite appreciating the gesture. He doesn't want people to think their extraordinary bond could be tied to any form of financial gain. And while it saddens me that our Community can't express gratitude this way, I deeply respect Leonel's decision, closed the campaign and will refund the money to the donors. While this may seem like a setback, it is still an opportunity to celebrate Bobi's life. We have learned invaluable lessons about his care and natural diet and were touched by their incredible bond.
