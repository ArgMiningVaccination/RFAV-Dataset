WILKE, MD, EDITOR The herbal medicine boom: Understanding what patients are taking ANA VANN, PharmD Drug information clinical pharmacist, Cleveland Clinic. F PHYSICIANS WERE TO ASK every patient if he or she is taking herbal medica- tions, one in three would answer yes, accord- ing to a 1993 survey.1 Sales of herbal medi- cines are booming, totaling $2.5 billion in 1996 and growing 25% per year.2 Unfortunately, the herbal medicine indus- try is not sufficiently regulated to guarantee that an herbal preparation is safe for con- sumption. Although some herbal prepara- tions, such as homeopathic remedies, contain no active ingredients at all, others contain substances that do produce effects\u2014including adverse reactions and interactions with pre- scription drugs. Claims of efficacy are unsub- stantiated, based mostly on anecdotal evi- dence. Worse, there is frequently no way to ascertain exactly what an herbal preparation contains, as labeling is often inadequate or inaccurate, and some manufacturers continue to use potentially dangerous herbs. Obtaining information about the effects of herbal medications is difficult. Herbs often have several different names, and herbs with similar or even identical names sometimes belong to different species entirely. There is no regulation of the purity of the substances, and no standardization of dosages. They are sold over-the-counter with no instructions as to possible side effects or interactions. WHY DO PEOPLE TAKE HERBAL MEDICINES? There may be a number of explanations, from a failure to understand the scientific process3 to skepticism about modern medicine. Among factors that may be at work: Fear or distrust of physicians. One pam- phlet touts \"health secrets your doctor doesn't want you to know,\" and hints that physicians and pharmaceutical companies are conspiring to suppress information about unconventional therapies. \"Natural is better.\" Popular mythology holds that allopathic medicine is unnatural and therefore bad, while herbal cures are nat- ural and therefore good. Natural cures help one \"build resistance\" to disease, according to this thinking. Disappointment with allopathic care. Many persons who seek alternative therapies have chronic conditions for which there is no effective cure; they often use herbal prepara- tions as an adjunct to allopathic therapies. For such persons, taking an herbal medication is a way of helping themselves while exerting more control over their own health care. Other influences. Some cultures have a tradition of using herbal medicine. Other peo- ple may be swayed by false advertising, word- of-mouth, and peer influences prevalent in their society. WHAT PRODUCTS DO PEOPLE TAKE? Data compiled from manufacturers indicate that ginseng accounts for 20% of herbal medications taken, garlic preparations for 18%, ginkgo for 10%, melatonin (which is not an herb) for 19%, and all others for 33%.4-6 However, hundreds of substances are available, and many products contain multiple substances. The following section lists some common herbal medications, their reputed effects, and what is known about possible side effects and drug interactions. If a physician has questions about an unfamiliar herbal medicine, he or she should call a local drug information center, the FDA consumer hotline (800-FDA-4010), or the National Institutes of Health Office of Alternative Medicine (888-644-6226). The Lawrence Review of Natural Products, published by Facts and Comparisons in St. Louis, Missouri, is a reliable reference of herbal med- icines' known therapeutic and adverse effects. TAKE-HOME POINTS FROM EDUCATIONAL PRESENTATIONS BY CLEVELAND CLINIC FACULTY AND VISITING PROFESSORS In the world of herbal medicine, let the buyer beware CLEVELAND CLINIC JOURNAL OF MEDICINE VOLUME 65 NUMBER 3 MARCH 1998 15 on September 17, 2023.

However, its effective- ness is not adequately documented. It may lower total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Some ingredients raise blood pressure, and some lower it.7 Complicating the issue: there are eight species of ginseng, and one of them\u2014Siberian gin- seng\u2014is completely different from the others. These issues may be moot for some products labeled as ginseng: one study looked at 10 \"gin- seng\" products and found that seven contained no ginseng at all.8 A study from the late 1970s analyzed 54 ginseng products; of these, 60% contained less than the therapeutically effec- tive levels, and an astounding 20% contained no active ingredient.9 Precautions and interactions. Nervous- ness and excitation can occur for the first few days of intake. Overuse can cause headache, insomnia, and palpitations. Patients with hypertension should be cautious of ginseng because of its unpredictable effect on blood pressure. One case10 has been reported of an interaction between ginseng and furosemide (decreased diuretic effect probably caused by germanium contamination), which resulted in hospitalization. Estrogenic effects have caused vaginal bleeding and mastalgia; patients should not take ginseng with hormonal therapy in light of cases of uterine bleeding.11-13 Patients should be discouraged from using ginseng long- term (more than 3 months). Ginkgo (Qinkgo biloba, maidenhair) Garlic reduces total and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raises HDL. It may have antibacterial, interactions. Garlic has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation and therefore may interact with anticoagu- lants. It reduces blood sugar, and may there- fore affect glucose control. Rarely, it causes allergic reactions.15 Ginkgo has been used in China since ancient times.16'17 It dilates arteries, capillaries, and veins, and has been shown to have significant beneficial effects on cognitive function, enhance various CNS functions such as short- term memory, concentration, and alertness,18 and improve cognition in Alzheimer's dis- ease.19 There are data in animals that ginkgo protects against cerebral ischemic damage, and may enhance blood flow to the brain.20.21 People are also using it to vascular insufficiency, dementia, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Precautions and interactions. Ginkgo- lide is a selective antagonist of platelet aggre- gation. A few case reports of bilateral subdural hematomas have been reported. These cases were all linked with prolonged use of this herbal remedy (longer than 2 years).23 It may cause minor GI disturbances. Rarely, ginkgo causes headache, dizziness, or vertigo.24 Garlic (Allium sativum) 130 CLEVELAND CLINIC JOURNAL OF MEDICINE VOLUME 65 NUMBER 3 MARCH 1998 on September 17, 2023. For personal use only.

Although its mechanism of immune stimulation is unknown, it may work by stimulating the production of phagocytes.25 Precautions and interactions. This herb may cause immunosuppression with continu- ous use (6 to 8 weeks).26 It is contra indicated in patients with autoimmune diseases. Ma huang (Ephedra sinica and others). More than 40 species of Ephedra are known, some of which contain alkaloids including ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. It is used in asthma and to treat colds. It is used alone and in combination with St. John's wort in weight-loss products, although it has not been shown to be safe or effective for this purpose. Precautions and interactions are similar to those for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. Doses used in herbal weight-loss products and herbal cold preparations containing ma huang are typically excessive, and the range of side effects is unpredictable. Patients are strongly discouraged from taking any herbal remedy containing this herb. Saw Palmetto is widely used in Europe to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In fact, up to 90% of patients with BPH in Europe take herbal medications, and 50% of European urologists prefer herbs to alpha blockers. Lipid extracts of saw palmetto contain fatty acids and sterols that have antiandro- genic activity in vitro. However, human stud- ies have been inconclusive. These studies also used very high doses of the extracts; therefore, the levels of active ingredient may be exces- sive in humans.27 Precautions and interactions. Side effects are minimal. Saw Palmetto may, in theory, have a synergistic effect with the hormonal therapy used in BPH. St. John's wort is pharmacologically similar to monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and is used as an antidepressant and to treat menopausal and premenstrual symptoms. The FDA lists it as a new investigational agent (it was previ- ously listed as unsafe). Several small studies found St. John's wort to be more effective than placebo for treating mild to moderate depression.28 Precautions and interactions. To avoid the risk of a hypertensive crisis, patients tak- ing St. John's wort should observe the same precautions as with the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, avoiding not only foods that con- tain tyramine (eg, aged meats and cheese), but also sympathetic amines (eg, amphetamine, phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine).

Serotonin syndrome is char- acterized by confusion, shivering, agitation, fever, diaphoresis, diarrhea, myoclonus, hyper- reflex ia, and tremor. However, no study of sys- temic interactions with drugs or food has been conducted. Phototoxicity has occurred in animals grazing on the plant, but is unlikely within therapeutic doses. In addition, some orthosta- tic hypotension has been reported.29 Valerian has sedative and hypnotic effects. Precautions and interactions. Cases of severe liver damage have been reported.^0 Valerian can cause morning drowsiness, atax- ia, and fatigue. Cytotoxic activity has raised concern about long-term use. It is not syner- gistic with alcohol, but has not been studied with opiates or other central nervous system sympa- thicolytic and mydriatic, yohimbe is available both as a prescription drug and as an herbal product. It is used to treat male erectile dys- function. Precautions and interactions. Yohimbe has a high risk-to-benefit ratio. It can cause central nervous system stimulation, hypoten- sion or hypertension, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and psychoses. It may have monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity, and may interact with antidepressants. This prod-uct should be used only under the supervision of a physician. Only the prescription product should be used, as herbal doses may be exces- sive. It is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency. HERBAL MEDICINE SHOULD BE REGULATED Federal drug laws govern prescription and over-the-counter drugs but exclude herbal preparations, which cannot be patented. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education (DSHE) Act of 1994 defines herbal medica- tions as dietary supplements, and therefore these supplements are treated more like foods than drugs. In fact, a can of tomato sauce is subject to more scrutiny than are herbal med- ications. Under the law, packages of herbal remedies must carry the disclaimer: \"This product has not been evaluated by the FDA and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.\" In other words, let the buyer beware. Further, there is no restriction on placing pamphlets, books, and posters in proximity to the products, and these often carry biased, mis- leading, and false information. When herbal products, which undergo no testing or inspec- tion, are displayed for sale in licensed pharma- cies, adjacent to products that are rigorously tested, they gain an aura of respectability by association. Consumers may be misled into believing they are purchasing something that has been proven safe and effective. 130 CLEVELAND CLINIC JOURNAL OF MEDICINE VOLUME 65 NUMBER 3 MARCH 1998 on September 17, 2023.

Do not take herbs if you are pregnant or attempting to become pregnant. Do not take herbs if you are nursing. Do not give herbs to a baby. Do not take large quantities of any one herbal preparation. Do not take any herb on a daily basis. Buy only preparations in which the plants are listed on the packet. (Note: there is no guarantee attached to any herbal product.) Do not take herbal medicines if you have allergies to plants. Always tell your doctor about any herbal remedy or alternative medicine you may be taking. ADAPTED FROM HUXTABLE RJ. THE HARMFUL POTENTIAL OF HERBAL AND OTHER PLANT PRODUCTS. DRUG SAFETY 1990; 5(SUPPL 11:126-136. We need a better system to protect the public. For starters, the names of substances need to be standardized, as do the formula- tions and doses. Some regulatory body should be given the power to truly regulate herbal drugs, requiring manufacturers to ensure the standarization, purity, and consistency of manufacture of all herbal preparations. As part of implementing the DSHE Act (if 1994, a commission composed of leaders in the field of herbal medicines has been created. The primary goal of this commission is to reform labelling laws and provide additional needed information regarding these remedies, particularly for the public. In addition, the manufacturing practices of these manufactur- ers of dietary supplements will be analyzed. The Commission report is scheduled to be published this year. In the meantime, health-care providers should ask patients if they are taking herbal medicine and should be prepared to offer com- mon-sense advice (TABLE 1). Physicians should report adverse events due to herbal medications to the FDA (800- FDA-1088), just as with other medications. H! REFERENCES 1. Eisenberg DM, Kessler RC, Foster C, et al.
