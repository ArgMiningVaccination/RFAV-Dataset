The Bonds will be issued as fully registered bonds in denominat ions of $5,000 each or any integral multiple of $5,000 within a maturity (each, an \"Authorized Denomination\"). The Bonds will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, New Yor k, New York (\"DTC\"), pursuant to DTC's book-entry only system (the \"Book-Entry Only System\"). Purchase s of beneficial interests in the Bonds will be made in book-entry form only. If at any time the Book-Entry Onl y System is discontinued for the Bonds, the Bonds will be exchangeable for other fu lly registered certificated Bo nds of the same maturity in Authorized Denominations. See Appendices A and D. For so long as Cede & Co. is the Registered Owner of the Bonds, interest and principal shall be paid and delivery shall be made as described in th e operational arrangements refe rred to in the Letter of Representations and pursuant to DTC's standard procedures. See Appendices A and D.

Any notice for redemption may be conditional, in which case the conditions shall be set forth therein. Effect of Redemption .

SECURITY FOR THE BONDS Special Fund Obligations The Bonds are special fund obliga tions of the University, payable solely from General Revenues and the money and investments that are deposited into the special fund designated as the General Revenue Bond Redemption Fund, 2018 (the \"Bond Fund\"). The Bonds are not an obligation, either general, special or moral, of the State, nor a general or moral obligation of the University. The Registered Owners of the Bonds shall have no right to require the State, nor has the State any obligation or legal authorization, to lev y any taxes or appropriate or expend any of its funds for the payment of the principal of or the interest or any premium on the Bonds. The University has no taxing power. The University is obligated to pay debt service on the Bonds fr om General Revenues; how ever, the obligations of the University are not secured by a statutory lien on or security interest in General Revenues. The University's commitment to apply Gen eral Revenues to pay debt service on the Bonds is a legally enforceable covenant. There is no coverage covenant, debt service reserve requirement or additional bonds test in the Resolution. General Revenues \"General Revenue\" or \"General Revenues\" means all non-appropria ted income, revenues and receipts of the University if and to the extent such funds are not restricted i n their use by law, regulation, or contract. For example, the following items are restricte d and, therefore, excluded fro m General Revenues: (a) Appropriations to the Univer sity by the State from the Stat e's General Fund; -5- (b) Each fund the purpose of which has been restricted in writi ng by the terms of the gift or grant under which such fund has been donated, or by the donor thereof ; (c) Fees imposed upon students as a condition of enrollment at the University, including but not limited to services and activitie s fees, building fees (\"Buildi ng Fees\") and technology fees; and (d) Revenues and receipts attri butable to the Metropolitan Trac t Revenue (which consists of revenues from 11 acres owned by the University in downtown Seattle, know n as the \"Metro Tract\"). As noted under subsection (b) above, grants or other funds that are restricted by contract or donor terms are excluded from General Revenues. S ee \"UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON\u2014G eneral Revenues.\" Unrestricted fund balances, to the extent that they were accumulated from mo ney that was received as General Revenues, are included in and available to pay obligations secured by General Revenues. Any interest subsidy received from the federal government with respect to General Revenue bonds is inc luded and available to pay obligations secured by General Revenues. Additions to General Revenues The University reserves the right to include in General Revenue s, at its sole option, in the future, other sources of revenue or income currently excluded in the definition of Gener al Revenues. Such additions shall occur on the date and as provided in a certificate executed by the controller of the University (the \"Controller\") (or the successor to the functions of the Controller). The Controller shall, in the case of additions of items or auxiliaries to General Revenues, certify that for the preceding two Fiscal Years for w hich audited financial statements are available, the item or auxiliary maintained a \"coverage ratio\" of at least 125 percent. In the event an auxiliary or item is added to General Revenues, the obligations of that auxiliary or item may remain outstanding and have a prior claim on auxiliary Net Revenue. Deletions from General Revenues The University reserves the right to remove, at its sole option , in the future, without limitation, any revenues from General Revenues. The removal of General Revenues shall be evid enced by a certificate executed by the Controller identifying the items to be deleted. The University is not requ ired to meet any coverage or other test prior to removing revenues from General Revenues. Building Fee Revenue Bonds The State Legislature (the \"Legislature\") has previously author ized and may in the future authorize the University to issue a bond or bonds to be paid from Building Fees and trust land revenues deposited into the University of Washington bond retirement accoun t, in accordance with RCW 28B. 20.700 through 28B.20.740 (the \"Building Fee Revenue Bond Statute\"). The Building Fee Revenue Bond Statute p ermits the University to issue bonds payable from and secured by a pledge of any or all of the Building Fees and trust land revenues deposited in the University of Washington bond retirement fund (\"Building Fee Revenue Bonds \"). In addition, Building Fee Revenue Bonds are payable from General Revenues and money and investments in the Bond Fund. The Building Fee Revenue Bond Statute is subject to amendment from time to time. Although Bui lding Fees and trust land revenues may be pledged, and may be applied, to pay a portion of the Bonds, Bond owners should look to the University's General Revenues as the credit for payment of the Bonds. Under the Resolution, the Board of Regents has covenanted to es tablish, maintain and collect Building Fees in such amounts that will provide money sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on all bonds (outstanding Building Fee Revenue Bonds and any additional building fee revenue bonds hereafter issued) payable out of the University of Washington bond retirement fund, to set aside and maintain rese rves, if any, required to secure the payment of such principal and interest, and to ma intain coverage, if any, which may be required over such principal and interest. Building Fee Revenue Bonds are n ot general or special obligatio ns of the State, but are limited obligation bonds of the University payable only from Building Fees, money and inves tments in the University of Washington bond retirement fund, General Revenues and money and investments in the Bond Fund. -6- Additional Bonds The University may incur additional obligations, including bond s, Payment Agreements (such as interest rate swaps) and lease or other con tractual obligations, that are payable fr om General Revenues, in addition to the University's outstanding General Revenue Notes (Commercial Paper) (the \"Commercial Paper Notes\"), th e outstanding General Revenue bonds, the Bonds and other lease and contractual obliga tions. There are no limitations, either statutory or contractual, that would prevent the University from incurring s uch additional obligations. Payment Agreements To the extent permitted by State law, the University may enter into Payment Agreements payable from General Revenues subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions prec edent. Payment Agreements, as defined in chapter 39.96 RCW, include interest rate swaps entered into in connecti on with the issuance of bonds. The University curre ntly has no Payment Agreements in place. No Acceleration Upon Default If the University were to default on the payment of principal o f or interest on the Bonds, payment of the principal of and accrued interest on the Bonds would not be subject to accel eration. The University is liable for principal and i n t e r e s t p a y m e n t s o n l y a s t h e y b e c o m e d u e . I n t h e e v e n t o f m u l t iple defaults on the payment of principal of or interest on the Bonds, the Bondholders would be required to bri ng a separate action for each such payment not made. This could give rise to a difference in legal interests b etween owners of earlier- a nd later-maturing Bonds. Any such action to compel payment or for money damages would be subject to the limitations on legal claims and remedies against public bodies under State law. Debt Payment Record The University has never defaulted on the payment of principal of or interest on any of its bonds or other debt. Future Debt The University expects to borrow approximately $100 million for projects already authorized by the Board of Regents after the issuance of the Bonds. In addition, the Unive rsity expects to continue to make draws on a $30 million non-revolving line of credit to finance short-term Univ ersity assets (the \"Line of Credit\"). Additional projects may be funded on an interim basis with proceeds of Com mercial Paper Notes or on a long-term basis with proceeds of bonds, in each case if approved by the Board of Regents. UNIVERSITY DEBT AND ESTIMATED DEBT SERVICE General Revenue Obligations The University's General Revenue obligations take three forms: (1) General Revenue bonds, including the Bonds, and Commercial Paper Notes . (i) General Revenue Bonds. From time to time, the University issues and has outstanding Ge neral Revenue bonds, such as the Bonds, to finance University purpose s in accordance with law. (ii) Commercial Paper Notes. The University is authorized to issue Commercial Paper Notes fr om time to time in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $25 0 million, for University purposes, pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted on Jul y 16, 2009. The University issues Commercial Paper Notes generally to provide interim financing for University projects, including a portion of the projects to be financed by the Bonds and other projects to be financed by future General Revenue bonds. The University provides self-liquidity f or the payment of its Commercial Paper Notes, which are not curre ntly secured by a bank credit o r liquidity facility. -7- (2) Leases and other contractual obligations payable from General Revenues . (i) Leases supporting Lease Revenue Bonds . The University has entered into a number of financing and other leases in connection with lease revenue bonds, which are payable from General Revenues. University lease paymen ts are applied to pay debt ser vice on lease revenue bonds issued by the Washington Economic Development Finance Authority or by nonprofit corporations issuing bonds on behalf of the University. Lease revenue bonds have financed the University's multi-phase South Lake Union biomedical research facilities and other clinic, research and administrative facilities. (ii) Other Contractual Obligations . The University has entered into other contracts payable from all or a component of General Revenues and, in some cases, other reven ues.

The following table shows General Revenues and General Revenue balances of the University for Fiscal Years 2013 through 2017. The table shows the calculation of General Revenues in two ways: first as gross University revenues minus exclusions from General Revenues; and second as the speci fic components that comprise General Revenues. \"Total Revenue\" presented in the first calculation is adjusted to include certain net non-operating revenue, interest on capital asset related debt and ot he r r e ve nue s . S e e \" U N I V E R S I TY REVENUE AND EXPENSES\u2014University Total Revenue By Source.\" The definition of \"General Revenues\" in the Resolution provides that unrestricted fund balances, to the extent that they were accumulated from money that was received as General R evenues, also are includable and available to pay obligations secured by General Revenues. To illustrate unrestri cted fund balances that may be available to pay General Revenue obligations, the following table shows general net position and also shows general net position adjusted to remove certain non- cash items (to show the figure e xcluding the effect of Governmental Accounting Standards Board (\"GASB\") Statement No. 68, which was implemente d in Fiscal Year 2015, and GASB Statement No. 73, which was implemented in Fiscal Year 2017).

Source: The University's General Revenue Supplement to Audited Financial Statements, except as indicated in notes 5 and 6. -12- Financial support is received by the University from a variety of sources, including grants and contracts, patient services, tuition and fees, State funding, gifts, auxiliary ent erprises, investment income and sales and services. As shown in the table entitled \"GENERAL REVENUES,\" several of thes e sources are unrestricted and are included in General Revenues: auxiliary systems and patient services, student tuition and fees (less student activities fees, U- Pass fees, technology fees, Building Fees and student loan fund s), grants and contracts indirect costs, sales and services of educational departments of the University, other op erating revenue, and invested funds' distribution and net invested funds' unrealized gains and losses. General Revenue Components The following chart shows the General Revenue components for Fi scal Year 2017. Figure 1: General Revenue Components, Fiscal Year 2017 (dollars in millions) (1) Does not include student activ ities fees, technology fees, buil ding fees, and loan funds. (2) Auxiliary Systems and Patient Services do not include Valley or Northwest revenues. Source: Chart is derived from data included in the General Re venue Supplement to Audited Financial Statements of the University (Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2017). The following describes the largest components of General Reven ues, which include auxiliary systems and patient services, student tuition and fees, and grant and contract indirect costs. Auxiliary Systems and Patient Services Since the University incorporated auxiliary systems and patient services revenue into General Revenues in 2009, these revenues have represented the largest component of Genera l Revenues. Auxiliary systems and patient services revenue include patient services, housing and food services, other auxiliary enterprises, sports programs and other UW Medicine revenues. Auxiliary systems represented 12% of Gene ral Revenues in Fiscal Year 2017, while patient services represented 43%. See \"U W MEDICINE\" for a discussion of UW Medicine and its component units. -13- Student Tuition and Fees Student tuition and fees represent the second largest component of General Revenues. Student tuition is established by the Board of Regents within the tuition-setting authority de legated by the Legislature (in the case of graduate student and nonresident undergraduate student tuition) and with in the limitations established by the Legislature (in the case of resident undergraduate tuition). The University has authority to set tuition for graduate students and nonresident undergraduate student s. The Legislature limits incr eases in tuition for resident undergraduate students. In Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015, the University committed to free zing resident undergraduate tuition rates in exchange for moderate increases in State funding in both years. In Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017, despite facing required increases to K-12 funding, the Legislature reduced tuition for resident undergraduate students and substantially increased appropriations to the University to off set the lost tuition revenue. Resident undergraduate tuition rates were reduced by five and 15 percent below Fiscal Year 2015 rates in Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017, respectively. Future increases in resident undergraduate tuitio n were limited to annual increases of no more than the average annual percentage growth rate in the median hourly wage for Washington for the previous 14 years. The Legislature maintained this tuition policy in the 2017 legislat ive session. Accordingly, resident undergraduate tuition increases were limited to 2.2 percent for the 2017-2018 academi c year and 2.0 percent for the 2018-2019 academic year. The University raised resi dent undergraduate tuition by t he full 2.2 percent for the current 2017-2018 academic year. The State's adopted 2017-2019 biennial operating budget r equires the University to maintain a minimum enrollment level, which is below the current actual level. In addition to tuition, the University charges its students a v ariety of other fees. The degree to which these fees can be increased is governed by the provisions of Initiative 960, i ts reenacting initiatives and each omnibus appropriations act signed into law annually. As described under the heading \"INITIATIVES\u2014Initiative 960,\" Initiative 960 requires Legislative approval of fee increases a nd any new fee. The adopted State biennial operating budget allows the Board of Regents to increase fees by amounts judged reasonable and necessary by the Board of Regents. Fees include summer quarter tuition, fee-based and sel f-sustaining degree and certificate programs, services and activity fees, student technology fees, course and lab fees and other administrative fees. Certain other fees collected through proprietary transactions are also included in General Revenues, but may not be subject to Initiative 960. The University also has authority to waive or reduce tuition an d fees. Student tuition and fees revenue figures included in this Official Statement exclude amounts waived. Tui tion waivers are used to assist low-income students, recruit outstanding students and recruit and support graduate t eaching and research assistants. Tuition can be waived by the University for students meeting certain eligibility requ irements consistent with these objectives. Grants and Contract Indirect Costs Indirect costs from grants and contracts constituted the third largest component of General Revenues in Fiscal Year 2017. Grants and contracts fund a wide variety of research and training programs at the University. In Fiscal Year 2016, the University negotiated an increase to the indirect cos t/facilities and administrative cost (\"IDC/F&A\") rate. Over the next three years, the most common research activities will continue to see phased-in IDC/F&A increases of 1.0 percent to 2.5 percent. The University's expectations with regard to future grant and c ontract revenues (and therefore future grant and contract indirect cost revenues included in General Revenues) a re informed by its awards. Awards are received by the University over one or more fiscal years and, when received , are presented as grant and contract revenues in the University's financial statement s. For more information regardi ng grant and contract revenues for Fiscal Years 2017 and 2016, see \"APPENDIX B\u2014\"AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2017 AND 2016) AND REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION OF THE UNI VERSITY (FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017).\" The following award information pro vides information regarding the University's grant and contract awards for Fiscal Years 2013 th rough 2017.

As shown in Table 5, Harborview, Valley, Northwest, UW Physicians and UW Neighborhoo d Clinics revenues are not part of General Revenues. See \"Table 5: General Revenues, notes 2, 3 and 4.\" UW Medical Center, including Airlift Northwest, revenues are included in General Revenues; UW School of Medicin e revenues are included to the extent received as student tuition and fees, grant and contract indirect costs and other components of General Revenues. The following provides an overview of the integrated health system managed by UW Medicine. Components of UW Medicine UW Medical Center . UW Medical Center is a 529-licensed-bed hospital that is a di vision of the University. UW Medical Center provides highly sp ecialized inpatient and outpat ient healthcare to patients throughout the Pacific Northwest and also serves as a major clinical, teaching and res earch site for students and faculty of the University. In 2013, UW Medical Center began phase two of the Montlake Towe r project to construct new inpatient floors including the addition of intensive care, medical/surgical beds and operating rooms, all of which opened early in 2016. Phase two is expected to be fully completed in 2018. Harborview Medical Center . Harborview is owned by King County and has been operated and ma naged by the University since 1967. The University and King County entered into a 10-year hospital services agreement (with two renewable 10-year agreement terms) in February 2016. Harbor view is a Level 1 adult and pediatric trauma and burn center with 413 licensed beds that offers specialty care i n nearly every area of medicine. Harborview's primary mission is to provide and teach exemplary patient care and to p rovide health care for those patients King County is obligated to serve. Harborview's financial results are not incl uded in the University's financial statements. Valley Medical Center . Valley is a 321-licensed bed hospital in Southeast King Count y, and is a full-service acute care public hospital. Valley is o wned and operated by Public Ho spital District No. 1 of King County (the \"District\"). The District is a public agency as defined by RCW 39.34.020(1) and a municipal corporation. In addition to the hospital, the District operates a network of more than two doze n primary care, urgent care and specialty clinics throughout Southeast King County. The District entered into a s trategic alliance with UW Medicine in 2011. Valley continues to be included as a discretely presented component un it of the University following implementation of GASB Statement No. 80, Blending Requirements for Certain Compon ent Units effective as of Fiscal Year 2017 (\"GASB 80\"). Northwest Hospital & Medical Center . Northwest is a 281-licensed bed hospital in North Seattle, wh ich affiliated with UW Medicine in 2010. Northwest is a not-for-profit communi ty hospital offering comprehensive medical, surgical and therapeutic services. The University is the sole c orporate member of Northwest. Under GASB 80, primary governments that are the sole corporate member of component units organized as not-for-profit corporations are required to blend the balan ces, activities, and cash flows of the component unit with those of the primary government. Effective Fiscal Year 2017, Northwest is presented as a blended component unit of the University, rather than in its previous form as a discretely presented comp onent unit. The University is in the process of evaluating whether to integ rate UW Medical Center and Northwest into one hospital with two campuses. An evaluation team has recently rec ommended moving forward to seek requisite board approval to combine the two hospitals under one license. If a f inal decision is made to proceed, Northwest would be operated as a second campus of UW Medical Center and the two-ca mpus hospital would be financially, clinically and administratively integrated. If the integration proposal is approved by the Northwest Board, the UW Medicine Board and the Board of Regents, the integration is expected to t a k e e f f e c t J a n u a r y 1 , 2 0 1 9 . I t i s l i k e l y t h a t t h e Northwest corporation would be dissolved, at which point all No rthwest assets and liabilities would transfer to the University to be reported as par t of UW Medical Center. Followi ng integration, Northwest revenues would cease to be revenue or income separately reported as an exclusion from G eneral Revenues. Instead Northwest hospital and clinic operating revenues would be part of UW Medical Center re venues, which already are included within General Revenues. If integration and dissolution do not proceed, and No rthwest revenue remains a separate item, Northwest revenue would not be included in General Revenues unless and un til it can be added by certificate of the Controller. -23- See \"SECURITY FOR THE BONDS\u2014Add itions to General Revenues\" and Table 17: UW Medical Center, Northwest and Valley Financial Information for information rega rding Northwest's financial results and Table 16 for patient activity statistics, each showing historical perfor mance of the two hospitals. UW Neighborhood Clinics . UW Neighborhood Clinics is a network of clinics with 12 locat ions throughout the greater Seattle area. The clinics offer a spectrum of primary c are services, select specialty care and urgent care services as well as ancillary services, including on-site labor atory, X-ray facilities and nutrition services. UW Physicians Network, dba UW Neighborhood Clinics, is a not-for-p rofit corporation organized for the benefit of the UW School of Medicine, its facu lty practice plan, UW Physicians , and all of its affiliated medical centers. UW Neighborhood Clinics is presented as a blended component unit o f the University. UW Physicians . UW Physicians is the physician practice group for more than 2200 physicians and other healthcare professionals associated with UW Medicine. UW Physicians provid es primary and specialty care totaling more than one million patient visits each year. UW Physicians is a not-fo r-profit corporation whose members consist of clinically active faculty of the UW School of Medicine. Pursuan t to an agreement between the University and UW Physicians, UW Physicians is responsible for providing medical services to patients at hospitals owned or managed by the University and other sites of practice approved by the D ean of the UW School of Medicine. UW Physicians is presented as a blended component unit of the University. UW School of Medicine . UW School of Medicine was founded in 1946 and is recognized f or training primary care physicians and advancing medical knowledge through scientific r esearch. UW School of Medicine was second in the nation in research funding received from the National Insti tutes of Health in 2016. Physician faculty members of the UW School of Medicine staff UW Medical Center, Harborview, Northwest, and UW Neighborhood Clinics, as well as the Puget Sound Veterans Affairs Health Care System, Se attle Cancer Care Alliance (\"SCCA\") and Seattle Children's Hospital. Airlift Northwest . Airlift Northwest is a medical transport service that works w ith first responders throughout Washington, Alaska, Montana and Idaho to transport critically i ll and injured patients to local hospitals, regional trauma centers or specialty care facilities. The revenues, expe nses, assets and liabilities of Airlift Northwest are included in the University's financial statements. Patient Activity Statistics The table on the following page shows patient activity statisti c s f o r U W M e d i c a l C e n t e r , N o r t h w e s t a n d V a l l e y , which are the three hospitals managed by UW Medicine that are i ncluded in the University financial statements (directly, as a blended componen t unit and as a d iscretely presented component unit).

UW int Ventures Seattle Cancer Care Alliance . SCCA is a joint venture of UW Medicine, Seattle Children's Ho spital and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. SCCA integrates the cancer r esearch, teaching and clinical cancer programs of all three institutions to provide cancer care. Each member of S CCA has a one-third interest. The University accounts for its share of the joint venture under the equity method of a ccounting. Children's University Medical Group . Children's University Medical G roup (\"CUMG\") is a joint ventu re of UW Medicine and Seattle Children's Hospital established to assist the organizations in carrying out their pediatric patient care, charitable, educational a nd scientific missions. CUMG employs UW School of Medicine faculty physicians, and it bills and collects for their services as an agent of UW School of Medicine. The University records revenue from CUMG based on an income dis tribution plan effective Decemb er 31, 2008. Strategic Collaborations In addition to its affiliation with Northwest and its strategic alliance with Valley, UW Medicine has entered into a number of affiliations, strategic alliances and collaborations with third-party entities as par t of its mission to improve the health of the public. These relationships are intended to a ddress and further UW Medicine's strategic goals as described in \"APPENDIX B-\"AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2017 AND 2016) AND REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION OF THE UNI VERSITY (FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017)\" and below. In 2014, UW Medicine formed an Ac countable Care Network (\"ACN\") with other selected hea lthcare organizations and healthcare professionals in W estern Washington to assume re sponsibility for the healthcare of contracted patient populations intended to achieve the Triple Aim: improved health care experience for the individual, improved health of the population and more affordable care. The ACN has contracted with the Washington Health Care Authorit y (\"HCA\") to participate in its Puget Sound Accountable Care Program (\"ACP\") as a healthcare benefit option for Public Employees Benefits Board (\"PEBB\") members. The ACP is offered to all PEBB members who re side in Snohomish, King, Kitsap, Pierce, and Thurston Counties. The contract with HCA covering PEBB memb ers began January 1, 2016. -25- A subset of the network members has also agreed to participate with the ACN in a contract with Premera as part of its Accountable Health System (\"AHS\") product. As an AHS, th e ACN will share in accountability for the quality and cost of healthcare for Premera members who select t his plan. This product was sold both on and off the Washington Health Benefit Ex change (the \"Exchange\") in sele ct counties with coverage that began January 1, 2016. The AHS must have 5,000 planwide members per p roduct, per region for the ACN to share in financial savings and risk. The ACN is not at risk for the AHS product in 2016 or 2017. The ACN also entered into an agreement to provide health care s ervices to nonunion employees of a large local employer with coverage that began January 1, 2015. These arrangements provide an opportunity for shared savings be tween the ACN and the contracted entity based on achieving quality and financial benchmarks. If certain financia l benchmarks are not attained, UW Medicine and its network members are, is at risk for reductions in payment level s from the contracted entity based on the agreement. In July 2017, UW Medicine and MultiCare Health System (\"MultiCa re\") announced the for mation of a new alliance to expand access to high-quality healthcare and allow the two o rganizations to engage in joint activities to further the mission of each organization. Through the alliance, UW Medi cine and MultiCare are working to provide cost- effective and clinically integrated healthcare in communities t hroughout the Puget Sound region while supporting the education of the next generation of clinicians and advancin g research. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS The University's financial perfo rmance improved in Fiscal Year 2017 as compared to Fiscal Year 2016, with increased nonoperating income (investment income, gifts and state appropriations) offsetting an operating loss. The following describes Fiscal Year 2 017 results for the more significant components of University revenue, together with information regarding recent trends and challenges. See al so \"CERTAIN INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS.\" UW Medicine Operating Results . UW Medical Center, Northwest and Valley had a combined negative margin for Fiscal Year 2017. UW Medical Center's negative margin was prima rily due to lower than anticipated commercial reimbursements and higher than expected salary, wage and benefi t expenses, offset partially by an increase in patient volumes during Fiscal Year 2017. Margins were unfavorab le at Northwest for a variety of reasons, including a significant shift in payer mix and lower than anticipated pat ient volumes. Valley's negative margin in Fiscal Year 2017 was a result of a significan t shift in payer mix and a one -time early retirement program. The health care industry continue s to experience rapid change, including as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Educatio n Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \"Affordable Care Act\"). The Affordable Care Act changed how hea lthcare services are cov ered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of uninsured individuals, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, reduced Medicare and Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital p ayments, and established programs in which reimbursement is tied to quality and integration. In addition, the Affordable Care Act reformed certain aspects of health insurance, expanded effort s to tie Medicare and Medicaid payments to performance and quality, and contained provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enf orcement. Further, it provided for a value-based purchasing program and the establishment of accountable care or ganizations (\"ACOs\") and bundled payment pilot programs, which may create sources of additional revenue. The A ffordable Care Act also resulted in the creation of health insurance exchanges, including the Washington Health Plan Finder (the \"Exchange\"). The Exchange, coupled with the expansion of the Medicaid program in the State, has re sulted in providing health insurance coverage for some patients who had previously been receiving charity care. T he Exchange also includes coverage options for previously commercially-insured patients whose employers have e l e c t e d t o s e e k c o v e r a g e f o r t h e i r e m p l o y e e s i n plans that are more affordable t han traditional commercial plan s. Legislative efforts to significantly modify or repeal and potentially replace the Affordable Care Act have created ad ditional uncertainty; changes to the Affordable Care Act could significantly impact UW Medicine. As the health care industry experiences change, continued reimb ursement pressure from commercial and governmental payers as well as inflationary expenses increases have resulted in diminishing margins. On November 9, 2017, the Board of Regents approved UW Medicine's Financial Improvement and Transformation plan (\"Project FIT\"), a multi-year plan designed to improve fin ancial stability and position UW Medicine for the -26- future. Financial improvement is planned through revenue generation and cost savings with continued infrastructure investment. Key factors are planned related to clinical service growth and labor mix and productivity improvements. Fiscal Year 2018 represents the first year of Project FIT's mul ti-year plan. In general, UW Medicine's strategies are intended to improve financial per formance through the reduction of costs and streamlining the provision of clinical care, as well as mitigating recent negative reimbursement trend s being experienced within the market. Challenges include a continued focus on patient volumes shifting from inpa tient to outpatient settings due to technological advancements and demand for care that is more convenient, affor dable and accessible as well as the industry-wide migration to value-based payment models as government and priva te payers shift ri sk to providers. The following table shows financi al information for UW Medical Center, Northwest and Valley, which are the three hospitals managed by UW Medicine that are included in the Unive rsity financial statements (directly, as a blended component unit and as a discretely presented component unit). Table 17: UW Medical Center, Northwest and Valley Financial Inf ormation (1) (fiscal years, dollars in thousands) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 UW Medical Center Total Operating Revenue (1) Of these three hospitals, only UW Medical Center revenues are i ncluded in General Revenues for the University as of the date of this Official Statement. See \"UW MEDICINE\u2014Components of UW Medicine--Northwest Hospital & Medical Center\" for a discussion of a proposal to combine UW Medical Ce nter and Northwest into one hospital with two campuses, commencing in January 2019. If the proposal is approved, Northw est revenues would no longer be reported separately but would be a part of UW Medical Ce nter's revenues included in Gen eral Revenues. (2) $32 million of primary care funding for UW Neighborhood Clinics was reclassified to operating expense. Prior to the reclassification, operating margin would be (1.35%). Source: The University. Grant Awards . Grant and contract revenues accoun ted for 23 percent of Univers ity revenue in Fiscal Year 2017. In Fiscal Year 2017, federal and non -federal grant and contract aw ards were $1.63 billion, a 19 percent increase over Fiscal Year 2016. The University experienced a fou r percent increase in total fed eral research funds between Fiscal Year 2016 and Fiscal Year 2017. Fiscal Year 2017 data for the University show a seven percent increase in National Institutes of Health funds and a fi ve percent increase in National Science Fo undation funds compared t o Fiscal Year 2016. The University also experienced a 60 percent increase in non-fe deral funds from Fiscal Year 2016 to Fiscal Year 2017. The large increase in non-f ederal funding is due to $279 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to be collected over 10 years. It is expected that n on-federal funding levels will return to historical norms in future years. -27- State Appropriations and Tuition . State appropriations and tuition account for 21 percent of Univ ersity revenue in Fiscal Year 2017. As described under the heading \"GENERAL REVEN UES\u2014Student Tuition and Fees,\" following a period during which tuition revenue grew as State appropriati ons to the University declined, the State began to reverse that trend through increased appropriations between Fis cal Year 2014 and Fiscal Year 2017. State appropriations accounted fo r approximately six percent of the University's total revenue in Fiscal Year 2017. The State appropriates funds for certain University operating e xpenses and for a portion of the University's capital budget. These appropriations are subject to the Legislature's b iennial budget process. The table on the following page shows University expenditures of State operating and capit al appropriations to the University in Fiscal Years 2013 through 2017. Table 18: Expenditures o f State Appropriations to the Universit y By Type (fiscal years, dollars in millions) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Operating Appropriations $ 218.2 $ 262.1 $ 255.2 $ 302.1 $ 342.0 Capital Appropriations 47.1 7.7 20.8 39.2 64.2 Total Appropriations $ 265.3 $ 269.8 $ 276.0 $ 341.3 $ 406.2 Source: The University. The 2017 Legislature passed a final compromise operating budget for the 2017-2019 biennium shortly before a potential State government shutdown at the beginning of July 20 17. Despite facing constitutionally required increases to K-12 funding as described below, the final State b udget included targeted investments in public higher education including medical educa tion and STEM enrollments. In addition, the Legislature authorized salary increases for State employees and provided partial funding for those increases based on the assumption that tuition rates for students other than resident undergraduates would grow with inflation and cover compensation increases for faculty and staff. The 2017 Legislature failed to p ass a capital budget for the 20 17-2019 biennium. Therefore, most projects that were slated to receive funding for Fiscal Year 2018 will be delayed until a capital budget is approved. State funding for capital appropriations continues to be constrained, though the University expects to receive some State bonding capacity for critical capital proj ects once a budget is approve d. The Legislature continues to face budgetary pressure due to of court-mandated increases in K-12 education funding. Article IX of the Washington State Constitution provides that i t is the \"paramount duty\" of the State to make \"ample provision\" for basic education. A 2012 decision ( McCleary v. Washington ) by the Washington State Supreme Court (the \"Court\") held that the State was not adequately funding K-12 education to this constitutional standard. In 2015, the Court found that the Legislature had not achieved full cons titutional compliance and imposed sanctions in the form of a fine of $100,000 per day until the State adopts a com plete plan for constitutional compliance. The 2017 Legislature substantially increased appropriations to K-12 educ ation. On November 15, 2017, the Court ruled that the State remains in contempt as a result of its noncompliance with the Court's prior orders, due to the implementation of increased teacher salary allocations in the 2 019-2021 biennium and not by a previously established deadline of September 1, 2018; however, the Court f ound the State to have fully complied with respect to other issues. The Court retained jurisdiction over the case and continues to fine the State $100,000 per day of noncompliance. The Court declared its expectation that the Legi slature will enact measures to achieve full compliance during its 2018 regular session and further stated t hat, if such measures are not enacted, the Court will immediately address the need to impose additional remedial meas ures. See \"CERTAIN INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS\u2014Uncertainties of State Legislation and Initiativ es.\" Gifts. Gifts accounted for five percent of University revenue in Fisca l Year 2017. Philanthropic support increased substantially in Fiscal Year 2017 to an all-time University rec ord. In Fiscal Year 2017, the University received $564.4 million in total private support from 154,804 donors. Th is is up from the trailing five-year average of $423 million. Of the $564 million recei ved, approximately $321 milli on was private gifts and approximately $243 million was private grants. The Univers ity formally announced its Be Bo undless Campaign, with a goal of at least $5 billion, on October 21, 2016. The campaign will extend until Ju ne 30, 2020. -28- Beginning with audited financial statements for Fiscal Year 201 8, new GASB standards will apply to irrevocable split-interest agreements, a specific type of giving arrangemen t used by donors to provide resources to two or more beneficiaries. See Note 1 to \"A PPENDIX B\u2014AUDITED FINANCIAL STAT EMENTS (FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2017 AND 2016) AND REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION O F THE UNIVERSITY (FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017).\" Investment Income. Investment income increased in Fiscal Year 2017 to $443 milli on from $44 million in Fiscal Year 2016. The primary contributors of Investment Income are th e Consolidated Endowment Fund (\"CEF\") and Invested Funds Pool (\"IF Pool\"). The total value of the CEF as of June 30, 2017 was $3,144 million, including $615 million of units of CEF owned by the IF Pool. For the 10 years that ended June 30, 2017, the annualized return on the CEF was 4.7 percent. The total value of the University's op erating fund investments (the \"IF Pool\"), as of June 30, 2017 was $2,413 million, including the portion investe d in the CEF as described under the heading \"\u2014 Investments: Invested Funds and Endowment Funds.\" Investments: Invested Funds and Endowment Funds The Board of Regents is vested b y statute with the responsibili ty of managing the University's assets, including its investments. Depending whether investments are restricted or un restricted, investments may be available for payment of General Revenue obligations. Unrestricted fund balan ces, to the extent that they were accumulated from money that was received as General Revenues, are included in an d available to pay obligations secured by General Revenues. The Board of Regents establishes investment policy and has dele gated authority to carry out the day-to-day activities of the investment portfolios to the University of Washington In vestment Management Co mpany (\"UWINCO\"), an internal investment management co mpany, which is led by the Chi ef Investment Officer of the University. Investment performance is reviewed quarterly by the University of Washington Investment Management Company Board (\"UWINCO Board\"), which is the advisory board to the Boar d of Regents and UWINCO. Balances and returns on these funds have varied, sometimes significantly, fr om period to period. Invested Funds Pool (\"IF Pool\") . The IF Pool currently consists of four pools: Short-term Pool, Intermediate-term Pool, Long-term Investment Pool and Capital Assets Pool (\"CAP\") . Although the pool nam es were updated by the Board of Regents in May 2017, the investment strategies of the individual pools remain the same. The Short- and Intermediate-term Pools are invested primarily in high quality, fixed-income securities to meet the day-to-day obligations of the University. The Long-term Pool holds CEF uni ts that are intended to enhance the overall portfolio r e t u r n . I n M a y 2 0 1 4 , t h e B o a r d o f R e g e n t s a p p r o v e d t h e C A P , w h i ch allows funds to be spent on approved University capital projects. The size of the CAP is targeted at 10 percent of the IF Pool, and the maximum size is limited by policy to 15 percent of the IF Pool. University policy stipulated the following minimum and maximum percentages that the IF Pool may be invested in these pools as of June 30, 2017. The percentages that were inve sted in these funds for the periods ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2017 are shown below.

Source: University of Washington Investment Management Company. Endowment Distributions. Under the Board of Regents-approved spending policy for the CEF, distributions to endowed programs are made in an amount equal to four percent of the twenty-quarter rolling average of the CEF's market valuation. The spending policy calls for an additional a dministrative fee of one percent to support fundraising and stewardship activities (0.8 percent) and investment management (0.2 percent). Similar to program distributions, the administrative fee is based on the CEF's twe nty-quarter rolling average market value. LABOR, RISK MANAGEMENT AND RETIREMENT INFORMATION Labor Relations The University employs approximately 45,100 full-time and part- time employees, of whom approximately 18,600 are unionized. Pursuant to chapte r 41.80 RCW, the University ha s negotiated collective bargaining agreements to cover the 2017-2019 biennium with the following unions: Inlandboatmen's Union of the Pacific (mariners) Service Employees International Union (\"SEIU\") Local 925 (cleri cal and healthcare employees) Washington Federation of State Employees master group (service, library, public safety, skilled trade employees) UW Police Management group (police sergeants and lieutenants wh o are also represented by the Washington Federation of State Employees) Teamsters Local Union No . 117 (police officers) SEIU Local 1199NW (registered n urse, healthcare specialist, ima ging tech, social worker, anesthesia and respiratory tech employees primarily at Harborview Medical Cent er, and at Airlift Northwest) Washington State Nurses Associa tion (registered nurses at the U niversity of Washington Medical Center) Combined, these unions cover approximately 12,500 employees in 26 bargaining units. With respect to agreements covered by chapter 41.56 RCW, the Un iversity is currently n egotiating a successor agreement with the American Federation of Teachers Local 6486 ( representing approximately 34 English language extension lecturers within UW Educational Outreach). The University recently reached an agreement with the graphic communications bargaining unit, also represented by the Teamsters Local 117 in late October 2017. In October 2016, the University r eached agreement with the UW Hous estaff Association (representing approximately 1,300 medical residents and fellows at the University) on a con tract spanning November 1, 2016, to June 30, 2019. In the winter of the 2017-2018 academic year, the University wi ll enter into negotiations with the Value ($ in millions)-30- Workers Local 4121, representin g approximately 4,600 academic s tudent employees, whose current contract will expire on April 30, 2018. On October 3, 2017, United Auto Worke rs has filed a petition with the Washington State Public Employment Relations Commission to represent the Univers ity's approximately 1,200 to 1,300 post-doctoral fellows. On December 8, 2017, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists filed a petition with PERC to represent approximately 50 employees at KUOW-FM. The University has been in dis cussion with affected unions over the July 1, 2017 changes to RCW 43.01.040, which removed a requirement that employees work at least six months b efore being able to access their accrued vacation leave. The University is working with the unions to modify cont ract language to indicate that vacation leave can be used upon accrual. Employees will remain eligible for cash-out at separation if they are continuously employed for at least six months. In anticipation of the revisions to State law as a result of Initiative 1433 that will become effective on January 1, 2018, the University will soon begin impact bargaining with all interested unions about contract changes to sick time-off provisions and related issues. Risk Management The University is exposed to risk of loss related to tort liabi lity, injuries to employees and loss of property. The University purchases insurance pr otection for workers' compensa tion as well as marine, aviation and certain other risks. The University also purchases insurance protection for l oss of property at self-sustaining units and bond- financed buildings and where otherwise required by contract; ot herwise, the risk of property loss is retained, unfunded. For medical professional, general, employment practic es, and automobile liability, the University maintains a program of self-insurance reserves and excess insur ance coverage. The self-insurance reserves represent the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims resulting from e vents that have occurred on or before the statements of net position date. The reserves include the undiscounted amount s that will be required for future payments of claims that have been reported and clai ms related to events that have occurred but have not yet been reported. The self-insurance reserves are estimated through an actuarial calculation and included in long-term liabilities. See \"APPENDIX B\u2014\"AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (FISCAL YEARS ENDED J UNE 30, 2017 AND 2016) AND REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION OF THE UNIVERSITY ( FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017).\" Changes in the self-insurance reserves for the years ended June 30, 2013 through 2017 are noted below: Table 20: University Se lf-Insurance Reserves (fiscal years, dollars in thousands) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Reserve at Beginning of Fiscal Year $62,919 $79,708 $67,450 $82 ,201 $79,153 Incurred $82,201 $79,153 $ 78,484 Source: The University. Pension Plans The University offers four contributory pension plans: the Wash ington State Public Employees Retirement System (\"PERS\") plan, the Washington State Teachers' Retirement System (\"TRS\") plan, the Law Enforcement Officers' and Fire Fighters' Retirement System (\"LEOFF\") plan and the Uni versity of Washington Retirement Plan (\"UWRP\"). PERS, TRS, and LEOFF are cost-sharing multiple-employ er defined benefit pension plans administered by the Washington State Department of Retirement Systems (\"DRS\" ) . T h e U W R P , a s i n g l e - e m p l o y e r d e f i n e d - contribution plan, is administered by the University. The Unive rsity's noncontributory pension plan, the University of Washington Supplemental Retirement Plan, is a single-employe r defined-benefit plan, but is closed to employees who were not active participants on February 28, 2011. -31- PERS, TRS and LEOFF Plan Descriptions . The University contributes to PERS, TRS and LEOFF. PERS Plan 1 and TRS Plan 1 provide retirement and disability benefits, alon g with minimum benefit in creases beginning at age 66 to eligible nonacademic plan members hired prior to October 1, 1977. PERS and TRS Plans 2 and 3 provide retirement and disability benefits and a cost-of-living allowan ce to eligible nonacademic plan members hired on or after October 1, 1977. In addition, PERS Plan 3 and TRS Plan 3 have a defined-contribution component, which is fully funded by employee contributions. LEOFF Plan 2 provides r etirement, disability and d eath benefits. Members are vested after completing five years of eligible service. The authority to establish and amend benefit provisions resides with the Legislature subject to restrictions on impairing contractual obligations to employees. Harborview, a related party of the University, is owned by King County and is not included in the University's reporting entity for GASB financial reporting purposes. However , all of Harborview's employees are University employees. Therefore, under GASB 68, the University includes the pension-related amounts pertaining to employees working at Harborview in the amounts recorded in the University's Financial R eport. Harborview will continue to account for pension-related expenses using the curr ent \"funding\" approach, and does not record any of the associated GASB 68 liabilities. Significant reporting and actuari al assumptions related to the DRS plans in which the University participates are as follows: Fiduciary Net Position - The pension plans' fiduciary net positions have been determi ned on the same basis as they are reported by the pension plans. DRS financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accountin g principles (\"GAAP\"). The ret irement plans are accounted for in pension trust funds using the flow of economic resources measur ement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Member contributions a re recognized as revenues in the period in which the contributions are earned. Employer contributions are recognized when due and the employer has made a formal commitment to provide the contributions. Benefits and refunds are recogniz ed when due, and payab le in accordance with the terms of each plan. Chapter 43.33 RCW authorizes the Washington State Investment Board (the \"WSIB\") to have investment management responsibility for the pension funds. Investments ar e reported at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are included as investment income in the State ment of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position presented in the DRS Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. Pur chases and sales of investments are recorded on a trade-date basis. DRS publishes an annual report for retirement plans, which is a vailable at: (which is n ot incorporated into this Official Statement by this reference). Actuarial Assumptions - The total pension liability for each DRS plan was determined b y a n a c t u a r i a l valuation, conducted by the Washington State Office of the Stat e Actuary (the \"OSA\") as of June 30, 2015, with the results rolled forward to June 30, 2016 (the measureme nt period for the University's Fiscal Year 2017). The following actuarial assumptions have been applied to all prior periods included in the measurement: 3.0 percent total economic inflation, 3.75 percent salary infla tion Salary increase - expected to grow due to promotions and longev ity in addition to salary inflation assumption 7.50 percent investment rate of return Mortality rates were based on the RP-2000 Combined Healthy Tabl e and Combined Disabled Table published by the Society of Actuaries' Retirement Plans Experie nce Committee (\"RPEC\"). As recommended by the RPEC, the OSA applied offsets to the base table and recognized future improvements in mortality by projecting the mortality rates using 100 percen t Scale BB. Mortality rates are applied on a generational basis, meaning members are assumed to receive addi tional mortality improvements in each future year, throughout their lifetime. -32- The actuarial assumptions used in the June 30, 2015 valuation w ere based on the results of OSA's 2007- 2012 Experience Study. Additional assumptions for subsequent ev ents and law changes are current as of the 2015 actuarial valuation report. The long-term expected rate of ret urn on pension plan investmen ts was determined by the WSIB using a building block method in which a best estimate of expected futu re rates of return (expe cted returns, net of pension plan investment expense, but including inflation) are d eveloped for each major asset class. Those expected returns make up one component of WSIB's Capital Market Assumptions (\"CMAs\"). WSIB uses the CMAs and their target asset allocation to simulate future i nvestment returns over various time horizons. The long-term expected rate of return of 7.50 percent approximately equals the median of the simulated investment returns over a 50-year time horizon, adjusted to remove or damper any short-term changes that are not expected over the entire 50-year measurement period. Discount Rate - The discount rate used to measure the total pension liabiliti e s w a s 7 . 5 0 p e r c e n t . T h e projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate as sumed that contributions from plan members will be made at contractually required rates, and that contribu tions from employers will be made at statutorily required rates, actuarially determined (including t he component of PERS 2/3 and TRS 2/3 employer rates pertaining to the unfunded actuarial accrued lia bilities for PERS 1 and TRS 1, respectively). Based on those assumptions, the fiduciary net position for each p e n s i o n p l a n i n w h i c h t h e U n i v e r s i t y participates was projected to be sufficient to make all project ed future benefit payments of the current plan members. Therefore, the long-ter m expected rate of return on pe nsion plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pe nsion liability. Using the WSIB long-term expected rate of return, a 7.50 percen t future investment rate of return on pension plan investments was assumed for the test. The expected return on plan assets is the estimated long-term rate of return that will be earned on the investments used to fund the pension obligation. Contributions from plan members and employers were assumed to c ontinue to be made at contractually required rates (including the component of PERS 2/3 and TRS 2/3 employer rates pertaining to the unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities for PERS 1 and TRS 1, re spectively, as provided for in Chapter 41.45 RCW). Employer Contribution Rates . Employer contribution rates are developed in accordance with C hapter 41.45 RCW by the OSA, and include a DRS administrative expense component that is currently set at 0.18 percent of covered payroll. To calculate employer and employee contribution rates necessary to pre-fund the plans' benefits, OSA uses actuarial cost and asset valuation methods selected by the Legi slature as well as economic and demographic assumptions. The University's proportionate share of the State-wide required contributions for each DRS plan in which the University participates as of J une 30, 2017 and 2016 is shown i n the table below. Table 21: University's Proportion ate Share of Employer Contribu tion Rates (as of June 30) PERS 1 PERS 2/3 TRS 1 TRS proportionate share of pension expense is show n in the table below.

Faculty, librarians and professional staff are eligible to participate in the UWRP, a 403(b) defined-contribut ion plan, and the UW Supplemental Retirement Plan, a 401(a) defined-benef it retirement plan that is closed to new participants and operates i n tandem with the 403(b) plan. Both plans are administered by the University. Under GASB Statement No. 73, the University includes the pensio n-related amounts for the UWRP plan pertaining to employees working at Harborview in the amounts recorded in t he University's Financial Report (see Appendix B). Harborview will continue to account for pension-related exp enses using the current \"funding\" approach, and does not record any of the asso ciated GASB 73 liabilities. -34- UWRP Description. Contributions to the UWRP are invested by participants in annu ity contracts or mutual fund accounts offered by one or more fund sponsors. Employees h ave at all times a 100 percent vested interest in their accumulations. Benefits from the plan are ava ilable upon separation or retirement at the member's option. RCW 28B.10.400 et seq . assigns the authority to the Board of Regents to establish an d amend benefit provisions. UWRP Funding Policy. Employee contribution rates are five percent, 7.5 percent or 1 0 percent of salary, based on age. The University matches the contributions of emplo yees. Within parameter s established by the Legislature, contribution requirements may be established or am ended by the Board of Regents. Employer contributions for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were $ 112,420,000 and $111,015,000, respectively. UW Supplemental Retirement Plan Description. This plan provides for a supplemental payment component, which guarantees a minimum retirement benefit based upon a one-time calculation at each eligible participant's retirement date. The University makes di rect payments to qualifying retirees when the retirement benefits provided by the UWRP plan do not meet the b enefit goals. The Supplemental Retirement Plan was closed to new participants on February 28, 2011. UW Supplemental Retirement Plan Funding . The University received an actuarial valuation of the supplemental payment component of the UWRP with a valuation dat e of June 30, 2016. Update procedures performed by the Office of the State Actuary were used to roll forward the total pension liability to the measurement date of June 30, 2017. The University has set aside $230,782,000 and $198,831,000 as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for this liability. These funds do not meet the GASB technical definition of \"Plan Assets\" becau se they have not been segregat ed and restricted in a trust or equivalent arrangement. The total pension liability, therefore, does not r eflect a credit for these amounts. Table 25: Changes in Total Pension Liability (fiscal year, dollars in thousands) 2017 Beginning Total Pension Liability $512,372 Service Cost 19,892 Interest 15,097 Differences Between Expected and Actual Experience (74,919) Changes in Assumptions (28,553) Benefits Payments (5,136) Ending Total Pension Liability $438,753 UWRP Covered Employee Payroll 801,161 Total Pension Liability as a Per centage of Covered Employee Pay roll 54.76% Source: The University. -35- Table 26: Significant Assumptions Used to Measure the Total Pen sion Liability (dollars in thousands) Inflation: 2.75% Salary changes: 4.25% Source of mortality assumptions: RP-2000 Combined Healthy Table , with generational mortality improvements usi ng 100 percent Sc ale BB Date of experience study: April 2016 Discount rate: 3.58% Source of discount rate: Bond Buyer's 20-bond index 6/30/ 17 TPL measurement at $438,753 TPL discount rate increased rate decreased 1 percent: $507,452 Source: The University. Material assumption changes during the measurement period inclu de updating the GASB Statement No. 73 discount rate from 2.85% to 3.58% (decreased the total pension liability ) and updating the variable income investment return assumption used in the \"assumed income\" calculation from 6.75% to 6.25% (which increased the total pension liability). Healthcare and Life Insurance Be nefits; Other Post-Employment B enefits (\"OPEB\") Healthcare and life insurance progr a m s f o r e m p l o y e e s o f t h e S t a te (including University employees) are administered by the Washington S tate Health Care Authority (\"HC A\"). The HCA calculates the premium amounts each year that are sufficient to fund the State-wide health and life insurance programs on a pay-as-you-go basis. These costs are passed through to individual State agencies (in cluding the University) ba sed upon active employee headcount; the agencies pay the premiums for active employees t o the HCA. The agencies may also charge employees for certain higher cost options elected by the employ ee. State retirees may elect coverage through State health and life insurance plans, for which they pay less than the full cost of the benefits, based on their age and other demographic factors. The healthcare premiums for active employees, which are paid by the agency during employees' worki ng careers, subsidize the \"underpayments\" of retirees. An additional factor in the OPEB obligation is a payment that is required by the Legislature to reduce the premiums for retirees covered by Medicare (an \"explicit\" subsidy). For b oth calendar years 2016 and 2017, this amount was $150 per retiree eligible for par ts A and B of Medicare. This is also passed through to state agencies through active employee rates charged to the agency. There is no formal state or Univ ersity plan that underlies the subsidy of retiree health and life insurance. Actuarial Study. Actuarial studies, performed every two years by the OSA, calcul ated that the total OPEB obligation of the State at January 1, 2017 and 2015 was $5.5 bi llion and $5.3 billion, respectively. The annual required contribution was $534 million and $498 million for the State for 2017 and 2015, respectively. The OSA calculated the OPEB obligation based on individual State employ ee data, including age, retirement eligibility and length of service. The probability of an employee of a given ag e and length of service retiring and receiving OPEB benefits is based on State-wide historical data. The OSA's allocation of the cumulative State-wide liability rel ated to the University and its unconsolidated affiliates was estimated at approximately $1.2 billion and $997 million fo r 2017 and 2015, respectively. These amounts are not included in the University's existing financial statements, but this will change beginning with financial s t a t e m e n t s f o r F i s c a l Y e a r 2 0 1 8 . P u r s u a n t t o G A S B N o . 7 5 , t h e U niversity will be required to recognize its proportional share of the State's actuarially determined OPEB l iability, deferred inflows and deferred outflows of resources, and benefit expense. See Note 1 to \"APPENDIX B\u2014AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (FISCAL -36- YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2017 AND 2016) AND REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTAL I NFORMATION OF THE UNIVERSITY (FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017).\" The University paid $349 million and $324 million for healthcar e expenses in Fiscal Years 2017 and 2016, respectively, which included its pay-as-you-go portion of the OPEB liability, calculated by the OSA at $16 million and $7.9 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The OSA report is available at: http://osa.leg.wa.gov/Actuarial _Services/OPEB/OPEB.htm (which is not incorporated into this Official Statement by this reference). CERTAIN INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS The purchase of the Bonds involves investment risk. Prosp ective purchasers of the Bonds should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Official Statem ent, including its appendices, evaluate the investment considerations and merits of an investment in the Bonds and confer with their own tax and financial advisors when considering a purchase of the Bonds. The Bonds are payable from General Revenues, which include auxi liary systems and patient services, student tuition and certain fees, grant and contract indirect costs, sales and services of educational departments of the University, other operating revenue, and invested funds' distribution and n et invested funds' unrealized gains and losses. The University's ability to derive General Revenues from these sour ces sufficient to pay debt service on the Bonds depends on many factors, some of which are not subject to the c ontrol of the University. The following section discusses some of the factors affecting General Revenues; it ca nnot, however, describe all of the factors that could affect General Revenues. Uncertainties in the Higher Education Sector The U.S. higher education sector has faced uncertainties in an environment of rising tuition, changing enrollment trends, high student debt burdens, reduced state appropriations, federal funding constraints, competition for sponsored research, lower but recovering endowment returns and gift trends reflecting economic conditions. For the largest universities, growth in patient care revenue, investment income, and grants and contracts are important factors in terms of revenue outlo ok. The higher education secto r has experienced increased operating expenses as well as significant demand for capital investment in housing, dining, and student amenities, and the need to address deferred maintenance, including on aging facilities now requiri ng renovation. The higher education sector has experienced changing technology and delivery models, including a growth in online educational options and technology-related expenses. Proposals to reduce or eliminate t he tuition and student debt levels confronting low- and middle-income families may have implications for the higher education sector. Patient Services Revenue; Uncert ainties of the Health Care Sect or Patient services revenue is the largest component of General Re venues. The University gen erates patient services revenues through the operation of three hospitals as well as ne ighborhood and other clinics; a portion of these revenues is included in General Revenues. (The University also operates Harborview, but H arborview's results are not included in the University's financial statements.) The abi lity of the University to generate patient services revenue depends, in part, upon the financial health of the heal th care sector. Challenges inherent to the healthcare sector include potential repeal o f or amendments to the Afforda ble Care Act, funding cuts for Medicare and Medicaid, lower patient volumes, uncertainty over healthcare re form repeal, replacement or continued implementation and payer reimbursement pressure. UW Medicine ho spitals have agreements with federal and state agencies and commercial insurers that provide for payments at a mounts less than gross charges. The payer mix is a key factor in the overall financial operating performance of th e various UW Medicine components providing patient services. The Affordable Care Act affects almost all aspects of hospital and provider operations and health care delivery, and has changed and is continuing to change how health care service s are covered, delivered, and reimbursed. These changes are resulting in lower hospital reimbursement from Medi care, utilization changes, increased government enforcement activity and the necessity for health care provider s to assess, and alter, their business strategy and -37- practices, among other consequences. The Affordable Care Act al so has required, and may continue to require, the promulgation of substantial regulations with significant effect s on the health care industry. Thus, the health care industry is the subject of signi ficant statutory and regulatory requirements and consequently will be subject to structural and operational changes and challenges for a substan tial period of time. The full ramifications of health care reform may also become apparent only over additional time and through further regulatory and judicial interpretations. The Affordable Care Act and its implementation have faced legal and legislative challenges, including repeated repeal efforts, since its enactment. UW Medicine management can not determine the impact any major modification or repeal of the Affordable Care Act, or any replacement health care reform legislation, might have on patient services revenue that contributes to General Revenues, though s uch impacts could be material. Public and nonprofit health care providers often treat large numbers of indigent pat ients who are unable to pay in full for their medical care. In general, any legal, le gislative or executive action th at reduces federal health care program spending increases the number of individuals without health insurance an d may thereby increase the number of people seeking charity care and/or reduc e the number of people seeking health care for paymen t. General economic conditions also may affect the number of employed individuals w ho have health coverage and the ability of patients to pay for their care. Similarly, changes in governmental policy, which may result in coverage exclusions under local, county, state and federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) may increase the frequency and magnitude of indigent care by such hospitals and other prov iders. As part of H.R. 1, Co ngress has eliminated the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate to maintain health ins urance coverage. In addition, Congressional authorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (\"CHIP\") has lapsed, and CHIP has not been reauthorized as of the date hereof. Each of th ese changes may increase the n umber of individuals without health insurance, resulting in higher health insurance premiums, increased levels of indigent care and other potential consequences which UW Medicine management cannot predict. State law codified at RCW 70.170.060 prohibits hospitals from denying access to emergency care based on inability to pay or m aintaining admissions policies that result in significant reductions in charity care. Among other provisions (some of which are described herein), th e Affordable Care Act created \"health insurance exchanges\" (such as the Exchange) in which health insurance can be purchased by certain groups and segments of the population, expanded the availability of subsidies and tax credits for premium payments by some consumers and employers and required that certain terms and conditions be inc luded by commercial insurers in contracts with providers. In addition, the Affordable Care Act imposed many ob ligations on states related to health insurance. The exchanges are still relatively new, participation in them is ch anging, there is ongoing litigation regarding the subsidies, and the Trump administration has taken and proposed recent actions related to the health insurance marketplaces (including proposing to eliminate subsidies). UW M edicine management cannot predict the effects of the exchanges upon the financial condition of any third-party payer that offers health insurance or the rates paid by third-party payers to providers and, thus, upon patient service s revenues and the operations, results of operations and financial condition of the various UW Medicine components provi ding patient services. The health care sector has underg one and may continue to underg o significant legislative and regulatory change, including as described above. To date these changes and other f actors have led to mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, bankruptcies and closures. The University has e ntered into a number of recent affiliations, strategic alliances and collaborative relationships, and expects to enter into future arrangements. The University has experienced and expects a continued period of transition as it works to align affiliated and third-party entities' services and performance with b roader UW Medicine objectives. Tuition and Student Fee Revenues Tuition and student fees are the second largest component of General Revenues. See \"GENERAL REVENUES\u2014 Student Tuition and Fees.\" Certa in significant components of Ge neral Revenues, most significantly student tuition, are considered fees subject to Initiative 960, an initiative th at requires legislative appr oval for any fee increase or new fees. See \"INITIATIVES\u2014Initiative 960.\" Tuition is establis hed by the Board of Regents within the graduate and nonresident undergraduate tuition-setting authority delegat ed by the Legislature and is subject to certain statutory limits on resident undergraduate tuition. For Fiscal Years 2015 and 2016, the Legislature reduced tuition levels for resident undergraduate students and limited future i ncreases to a statutory growth factor. In addition to tuition, the University charges its students a variety of other fees that may be subject to Initiative 960. -38- A portion of student tuition revenue is used to support student financial aid. In the future, federal, State, institutional and private funders may not appropriate or approve funding for grant, scholarship, loan a nd other financial aid programs at the same levels and under the same terms as they ha ve in the past, which may affect the amount of financial aid available to University students. Changes in U.S. immigration policies may result in decreased en rollment among international students. Uncertainties of State Legislation and Initiatives The Legislature considers legisl ation from time to time that ma y affect the University, including without limitation legislation that appropriates funds for higher education; legis lation that authorizes Building Fee Revenue Bonds or Reimbursed Bonds for the benefit of the University; and legislation regarding public employees, benefits, tuition, academic standards, public procurement and contracting and othe r matters. The Legislature has faced budgetary pressure as a result of court-mandated increases in K-12 educat ion funding required by the 2012 Washington Supreme Court decision that the State was not adequately fundin g basic education to a constitutional standard. The 2017-2019 budget increased State funding of K-12 public educati on by $7.3 billion over four years (which may be offset in part by a reduction in authorized local funding), but the State has not yet satisfied all of the McCleary requirements. As described under the heading \"INITIATIVES,\" State initiative measures have been filed from time to time affecting the University or its revenues, including Initiatives 601 and 960. Various State initiative measures have been and may be filed, and approved, from time to time that may have a fiscal impact on the University and/or the State, and if affecting the Stat e, may impact State spending on higher education, including State appropriations to the University. Uncertainties of Federal Legislation Research funding from federal sources continues to be a large part of the University's total research revenues. Medicaid and Medicare payments contribute to patient services r evenue. Medicare and Medicaid payments represented approximately 41.5 percent of total net patient ser vices revenue in Fiscal Year 2017 (for UW Medical Center and Northwest). The University may be adversely impacted by federal legislative and executive or regulatory actions, including cuts to federal spending, changes to financi a l a i d p r o g r a m s , H . R . 1 , a n d a c t i o n s a f f e c t i n g international student enrollment. Federal funding, including fe deral research funding and healthcare reimbursement funding, is subject to federal legislative action, including th rough the federal budget process and sequestration. Budgetary acts, including the sequestration provisions of the B udget Control Act of 2011 and Statutory Pay-As- You-Go Act of 2010 (together \"Sequestration\"), could continue t o affect the availability of federal funds. Payments made by the federal government in connection with interest paym ents on taxable bonds eligible for federal interest subsidies between October 1, 2017 and September 30, 2018, were reduced through Sequestr ation by 6.6%, resulting in a reduction in subsidy payments related to certain Universit y bonds. Sequestration of such interest payments has been extended by Congress and is scheduled to remain in effect through federal fiscal year 2024. State and local reductions in funding could also affect University revenues. A shift from federal to non-federal research funding could reduce the relative amount of funding for indirect costs. H.R. 1's changes to estate taxes and deductions (including elim inating the 80% deductibility of certain athletic tickets and seat licenses) could negatively affect philanthropy as well as ticket and seat license sales. H.R. 1's elimination of tax-exempt advance refunding bonds affects the U niversity's ability to refund for debt service savings except on a taxable or current refunding basis. Laws and Regulation The University is subject to federal, State, and local laws and regulations, and grant requirements. Failure by the University to comply with, or violations of, statutory, regulat ory or grant requirements could result in the loss of federal or State grant funds and other consequences. These stat utory and regulatory requirements are subject to change and could become more str ingent and costly for the Unive rsity. -39- As described under the h eading \"Patient Services Revenu es; Uncertainties of the Health Care Sector,\" the healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, State, and local governments, including the Affordable Care Act. These laws and regulations include, bu t are not limited to, matters such as licensure, accreditation, governmental healthcare program participation re quirements, reimbursement for patient services, privacy of health records and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government agencies are actively conducting investigations concerning possible violations of fraud and abus e statutes and regulations by healthcare providers. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in expuls ion from government healthcare programs, the imposition of significant fines and penalties and significant r epayments for patient services previously billed. Recent regulatory, legislative and accounting activity is expected to impact all entities in UW Medicine during Fiscal Year 2018 and beyond. Accounting Rules The University is subject to accounting rules and standards pro mulgated by GASB. These rules may change, requiring the University at such time to value and state its accounts differently. For example, the implementation of GASB No. 68 and 73 has affected the University general net posi tion (see the table entitled \"GENERAL REVENUES\"). Commencing Fiscal Y ear 2018, GASB No. 75 also will affect the University general net position, as the University will be required to recognize its proportional s hare of the State's actuarially determined OPEB liability, deferred inflows and deferred outflows of resources, and benefit expense. See \"OTHER UNIVERSITY INFORMATION\u2014Healthcare and Life Insurance Benefits; Other Post- Employment Benefits (\"OPEB\").\" Limitations on Remedies Any remedies available to the Registered Owners of the Bonds up on the occurrence of an event of default under the Resolution are in many respects dependent upon judicial actions which are in turn often subject to discretion and delay and could be both expensive and time-consuming to obtain. If the University fails to pay principal of or interest on the Bonds, there can be no assurance that available remedies will be adequate to fully protect the interests of the Registered Owners of the Bonds. In addition to the limitations on remedies contained in the Res olution, the rights and obligations under the Bonds and the Resolution may be limited by and are subject to bankrup tcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights, to the application of equitable principles and to the exercise of judicial discretion in approp riate cases. The opinions to be delivered by Pacifica Law Group LLP, as Bond Counsel, concurrently with the issuance of the Bonds, will be subject to limitations regarding bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights. A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in APPEND IX C\u2014\"FORM OF BOND COUNSEL OPINION.\" Under State law, \"taxing distric ts\" are authorized to voluntari ly file a petition for bankruptcy under the federal bankruptcy code. The State is not authorized to file a petition for bankruptcy. Although the University is a political subdivision in some contexts, it is not considered a taxing dis trict under State property, excise or other tax statutes and does not have taxing power. Ac cordi ngly, it is not c lear that the U nive rsity has a uthority under State law to voluntarily file a petition for bankruptcy. State law does not provide for involuntary bankruptcy against the State or its political subdivisions. The Board of Regents is authori zed under State law to obligate all or a component of the fees and revenues of the University for the payment of bonds, notes or evidences of inde btedness, and the University has pledged General Revenues to the payment of principal of and interest on the Bon ds. State law does not provide for a statutory lien on General Revenues. No mortgage, deed of trust, lien or security interest has been granted to secure the payment of the Bonds. Under the terms of the Resolution, payments of debt service on Bonds are required to be m ade only as they become due and the occurrence of a default does not grant a right to a ccelerate payment of the Bonds. In the event of multiple defaults in payment of principal of or interest on the Bonds, the Bond owners could be required to bring a separate action for each such payment not made. Remedies for de faults are limited to such actions which may be taken at law or in equity. -40- Seismic and Other Considerations The University's Seattle, Tacoma and Bothell campuses are locat ed above or near a number of geological faults capable of generating significant earthquakes. Th e Puget Sound region, including portions of the University campus, is characterized by geotechnical conditions that could result i n areas of liquefaction and landslide in an earthquake. In anticipation of such potential disasters, the University designs and constructs its facilities to the seismic codes in effect at the time the projects are designed. Although the Univ ersity has implemented disaster preparedness plans, there can be no assurance that these or any additional measures will be adequate in the event a natural disaster occurs, nor that costs of preparedness measures will be as currently anticipated. Rising sea levels and changing regional rainfall patterns, such as an increase in winter rains torm frequency or intensity, are potential impacts of climate change for the University . The University can give no a ssurance regarding the effect of an earthquake, a tsunami from seismic activity in the State or in other areas, a volcano, mudslide or other natural disaster, climate change or acts of terrorism, or t hat the University's self-insurance reserves or proceeds of insurance carried by the University, if any, would be sufficient, if available, to rebui ld and reopen University facilities or that University facilities or surrounding facilities and infrastructure could o r would be rebuilt and reopened in a timely manner following a major earthquake or other disaster. See \"OTHER UNIV ERSITY INFORMATION\u2014Risk Management\" for a description of the University's insurance, including self -insurance. Continuing Compliance with Tax Covenants; Changes of Law The University's tax certificate will contain various covenants and agreements on the part of the University that are intended to establish and maintain the tax-exempt status of interest on the Bonds. A failu re by the University to comply with such covenants and agreements, including any remedi ation obligations, could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the tax-exempt status of interests on the Bond s. Any loss of tax exemption could cause all of the interest received by the Owners of the Bonds to be taxable. All or a portion of interest on the Bonds also could become subject to federal income tax as a result of changes of law. Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Tax Code\") or court decisions may cause interest on the Bonds to be subject, direct ly or indirectly, to federal income taxation or otherwise prevent beneficial own ers from realizing the full cur rent benefit of the tax status of such interest. State Initiatives and Referenda Under the State Constitution, the voters of the State have the ability to initiate legislation and to modify existing laws through the powers of initiative and referendum. An initiative measure is submitted to the voters (if an initiative to the people) or to the Legislature (if an initiative to the L egislature) if certified by the Secretary of State. An initiative or referendum approved by a majority of voters may n ot be amended or repealed by the Legislature within a period of two years following e nactment, except by a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house of the Legislature. After two years, the law is subject to amen dment or repeal by the Legislature in the same manner as other laws. Initiative 601 . Initiative 601, approved by State voters in 1993, limits State expenditures and revenues. Under Initiative 601, the State generally is prohibited from increasi ng expenditures from the State's general fund and related funds during any fiscal year by more than the fiscal gr owth factor, which equals the average growth in State personal income for the prior ten fiscal years. Initiative 601 also limits State revenue increases. Finally, Initiative 601 provides that no fee may increase in an y fiscal year by a percentage greater than the fiscal growth factor without prior legislative approval. The term \"fee \" is not defined in the initiative, so the University has interpreted informal guidance from the State Attorney General's Office to identify specific types of University fees as either covered by or exempt from Initiative 601. Under this guidance mandatory fees related to the regular State- funded instructional program or other degree-granting education programs are considered subject to Initiative 601. Other University fees are considered proprietary and not subjec t to the Initiative 601 limitation. Initiative 960 . In itiative 960, approved by State voters in November 2007, amen ded Initiative 601 to require legislative approval of all fee increases without regard to a f iscal growth factor. Initiative 960 also requires legislative approval of any new fee. Initiative 960 did not ame nd or define the term \"fee\" used in Initiative 601. On January 31, 2008, the State Offi ce of Financial Management dist ributed an informal memorandum (the \"OFM Memo\") to State agencies. Under the reasoning of the OFM Memo ( and the University policy interpreting Initiative -41- 601), certain components of General Revenues, most significantly student tuition, are considered fees subject to Initiative 960 and therefore cannot be increased without legisl ative approval. Other f ees collected through proprietary transactions are also included in General Revenues, but would not be considered fees subject to Initiative 960 under the reasoning of the OFM Memo. In the event that Initiative 960 were applied to limit the University's ability to increase fees that contribute to General Revenues, the University would, if necessary, seek to o btain legislative approval fo r fee increases or would pursue alternative revenue sour ces, program cuts or reallocatio ns. Other Initiatives. Other State initiative measures have been or may be filed from time to time affecting the University or its revenues. LEGAL INFORMATION No Litigation Con cerning the Bonds There is no litigation pending or, to the actual knowledge of t he University, threatened questioning the validity of the Bonds or the power and authority of the University to issue the Bonds or seeking to enjoin the issuance of the Bonds. Other Litigation The University is a party to lawsuits arising out of its normal course of business, but the University does not believe any of such litigation will have a material adverse impact upon the financial position of the University. Some of these claims are cov ered by insurance. Approval of Counsel Legal matters incident to the authorization, issuance and sale of Bonds by the University are subject to the approving legal opinion of Pacifica Law Group LLP, Seattle, Washington (\" Bond Counsel\"). The form of opinion of Bond Counsel is attached hereto as Appendix C. Pacifica Law Group LL P is also serving as Disclosure Counsel to the University in connection with the issuance of the Bonds. TAX MATTERS General In the opinion of Bond Counsel, under existing law and subject to certain qualifications described below, interest on the Bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income ta x purposes under Section 103 of the Tax Code, and is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal al ternative minimum tax imposed on individuals. The proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel with respect to the Bo nds to be delivered on the date of issuance of the Bonds is set forth in Appendix C. The Tax Code contains a number of requirements that apply to th e Bonds, and the University has made certain representations and has covenanted to comply with each such req uirement. Bond Counsel's opinion assumes the accuracy of the representations made by the University and is s ubject to the condition that the University comply with the above-referenced covenants. If the University fails to comply with such covenants or if the University's representations are inaccurate or incomplete, interest on the B onds could be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes retroactivel y to the date of issuance of th e Bonds. Except as expressly stated herei n, Bond Counsel expresses no op inion regarding any tax consequences related to the ownership, sale or disposition of the Bonds, or the amount, acc rual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds. Owners of the Bonds should consult their tax advisors regarding the appli cability of any collateral tax consequences of owning the Bonds. -42- Original Issue Premium and Discount If the initial offering price to the public at which a Bond is sold is less than the amount payable at maturity thereof, then such difference constitutes \"original issue discount\" for purposes of federal income taxes. If the initial offering price to the public at which a Bond is sold is greater than the amount payable at maturity thereof, then such difference constitutes \"original issue premium\" for purposes of federal income taxes. De minimis original issue discount and original issue premium is disregarded. Under the Tax Code, original issue discount is treated as inter est excluded from federal gross income to the extent properly allocable to each owner thereof subject to the limitat ions described in the first paragraph of this section. The original issue discount accrues over the term to maturity o f the Bond on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded on each interest or principal payment date (with str aight-line interpolations between compounding dates). The amount of original issue discount accruing during e ach period is added to the adjusted basis of such Bonds to determine taxable gain upon disposition (including sal e, redemption, or payment on maturity) of such Bond. The Tax Code contains certain provisions relating to the accrual of original issue discount in the case of purchasers of the Bonds who purchase the Bonds after the initia l offering of a substantial amount of such maturity. Owners of such Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of purchasers who do not purchase in the original offering, the allowance of a deduction for any loss on a sale o r other disposition, and the treatment of accrued original issue discount on such Bonds under federal individual alternative minimum taxes. Under the Tax Code, original issue premium is amortized on an a nnual basis over the term of the Bond (said term being the shorter of the Bond's maturity date or its call date) . The amount of original issue premium amortized each year reduces the adjusted basis of the owner of the Bond for pu rposes of determining taxable gain or loss upon disposition. The amount of origin al issue premium on a Bond is amortized each year over the term to maturity of the Bond on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded on eac h interest or principal payment date (with straight- line interpolations between compounding dates). Amortized Bond premium is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. Owners of premium Bonds, including purchasers who do not purchase in the original offering, should consult their own tax advisors with respect to federal income t ax consequences of owning such Bonds. Post Issuance Matters The opinion of Bond Counsel is based on current legal authority , covers certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel's judgment as to the proper treatment of the Bonds for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") or the courts. Furthermore, Bond Counsel cannot give and has not given any opinion or assurance about th e future activities of the University, or about the effect of future changes in the Tax Code, the applicable regula tions, the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by the IRS. Bond Counsel's engagement with respect to t he Bonds ends with the issuance of the Bonds, and, unless separately engaged, Bond Counsel is not obligated to def end the University or the Owners regarding the tax- exempt status of the Bonds in the event of an audit examination by the IRS. Under current procedures, parties other than the University and its appointed counsel, including the Ow ners, would have little, if any, right to participate in the audit examination process. Moreover, because achieving judi cial review in connection with an audit examination of Bonds is difficult, obtaining an independent review of IRS p ositions with which the University legitimately disagrees may not be practicable. Any action of the IRS, includ ing but not limited to selection of the Bonds for audit, or the course or result of such audit, or an audit of bo nds presenting similar tax issues may affect the market price for, or the marketability of, the Bonds, and may cause th e University or the Owners to incur significant expense. Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Tax Code or court decisions may cause interest on the Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal income taxation, or otherwise prevent beneficial owners from realizing the full current benefit of th e tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals, clarification of t he Tax Code or court decisi ons may also affect the market price for, or marketability of, the Bonds. Prospective p urchasers of the Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding any pending or proposed legislation, regulat ions or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion. -43- Not Bank Qualified The University has not designate d the Bonds as \"qualified tax-e xempt obligations\" within the meaning of Section 265(b)(3)(B) of the Tax Code. CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING Undertaking. The University is covenanting for the benefit of the holders an d beneficial owners of the Bonds to provide certain financial information and operating data (the \" Annual Disclosure Report\") by not later than seven months following the end of the University's fiscal year (which currently would be January 31, 2019, for the report for Fiscal Year 2018), and to pr ovide notices of the occurrence of certain enumerated events. The Annual Disclosure Report and notices of material events are to be filed with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. The nature of the information to be contained in the Annual Disclosure Report a nd i n n ot i c e s of m a t e r i a l e ve nt s i s s e t f or t h i n APPENDIX E\u2014\"FORM OF CONTINUING D ISCLOSURE CERTIFICATE.\" These c ovenants are made by the University to assist the Underwriters of the Bonds in complying with Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12(b)(5). Prior Compliance with Continuing Disclosure Undertakings . In reviewing its continuing disclosure filings on EMMA, the University determined that, while it had timely filed its annual financial and operating information in the form of its UW Bondholders Report in connection with its Ge neral Revenue bonds, the UW Bondholders Report was not linked to the CUSIP numbers for all bonds issued by or on behalf of the University. On July 16, 2014, the University re-filed its UW Bondholders Reports for the years en ded June 30, 2010, through June 30, 2013, to link these reports to the CUSIP numbers for outstanding bond issues. With respect to notices of material or listed events, the Unive rsity provided notice of certain insurer ratings downgrades, but has determined that notices had not been filed for every ratings event. On August 8, 2013, the University filed notices regarding the downgrade of the insurer of 2011 Bonds, and on July 16, 2014, the University filed a supplemental notice of insurer rating changes for outst anding insured bond issues. On October 12, 2016, the University filed a supplement updating and correcting figures included in the 2015 Bondholders Report. OTHER BOND INFORMATION Ratings Ratings of \"Aaa\" and \"AA+\" have been assigned to the Bonds by M oody's Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings Service, respectively. Such ratings reflect only the vi ews of the rating organizations, and an explanation of the significance of the ratings may be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance that the ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised downward or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in the judgment of t he agencies, circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision or withdrawal of any of the ratings could have an adverse effect on the marke t price of the Bonds. Financial Advisor The University has retained Piper Jaffray & Co., as financial a dvisor (the \"Financial Advisor\") in connection with the preparation of the University's plan of financing and with respect to the authorization and issuance of the Bonds. The Financial Advisor is not obligated to undertake, and has not undertaken, to make any independent verification or to assume responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or f airness of the information contained in this Official Statement. While under contract to the University, the Financia l Advisor may not participate in the underwriting of any University debt. Potential Conflicts Some or all of the fees of the Financial Advisor, Bond Counsel and Disclosure Counsel are contingent upon the sale of the Bonds. Pacifica Law Group LLP is serving as Bond Counsel and Disclosure Counsel to the University with -44- respect to the Bonds. From time to time, Bond Counsel and Discl osure Counsel serve as counsel to other parties involved with the Bonds with resp ect to transactions other than the issuance of the Bonds. Underwriting The Bonds are being purchased by JP Morgan Securities (the \"Purchaser\"), at an aggregate price of $156,268,762.17 (par plus original issue premium of $22,799,976.40, less an und erwriter's discount of $316,214.23). After the initial public offering prices may be va ried from time to time. The Pur chaser has not audited, authenticated or otherwise verified the information set forth in this Official Statement or any other related information available to the University with respect to the accuracy and completeness of dis closure of such information, and no guaranty, warranty or other representation is made by the Purchaser respe cting the accuracy and compl eteness of this Official Statement or any other matter re lated to this Official Statemen t.

This Official Statement is not intended to be construed as a contract or agreement between the University and the purchasers or holders of any of the Bonds. At the time of the delivery of the Bonds, one or more officials of the University will furnish a certificate stating that, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief at the time of t he sale or delivery of the Bonds, this Official Statement and information furnished by the University supplemental theret o did not and do not contain any untrue statements of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statemen t s m a d e , i n l i g h t o f t h e circumstances under which they we re made, not misleading in any material respect.

KPMG LLP Suite 29001918 Eighth AvenueSeattle, WA 98101 Independent Auditors' Report on Supplementary Information The Board of Regents University of Washington: We have audited the financial statements of the business -type activities and aggregate discretely presented component units of the University of Wa shington (the University), an agen cy of the state of Washington, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2017, and have issued our report thereon dated October 20, 2017, which contained unmodified opinions on those financial statements that collectively comprise the University's basic financial statements. Our audit was performed for the purpose of forming opinions on the finan cial statements. We have not performed any procedures with respect to the audited financi al statements subsequent to October 20, 2017. The supplementary information included on pages 2 through 4 is presented for the purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the unde rlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedu res, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records u sed to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards ge nerally accepted in the United St ates of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole. This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board of Reg ents and management of the University of Washington and rating agencies and bondholders who have previously received the financial statements of the University of Washington as of and for the year ended June 30, 2017, and our unmodified opinions thereon, for use in evaluating those financial statements, and is n ot intended to be, and should not be used for any other purpose. October to Supplementary Information June 30, 2017 (1) Basis of Presentation The General Revenue schedule presents the general inc ome of the University of Washington (University) that is not restricted in its us e by law, regulation, or cont ract. General Revenues, as defined in the bond agreements, are revenues pledged to bondholders under the Univers ity's General Revenue Bond platform. The supplementary information included herein reconcile s total University revenue to General Revenue pledged to bondholders. For example, the following items are restri cted and, therefore, excluded from General Revenues: a. Appropriations to the Univers ity by the state of Washington (state) fr om the state's General Fund; b. Revenues from gifts or gra nts restricted by the terms of the gift or grant either in writing or otherwise by the donor; c. Fees imposed upon students as a condition of enrollment at the Univers ity, including but not limited to services and activities fees, building fees, and technology fees; and d. Revenues and receipts attributable to the Metrop olitan Tract Revenue, which are appropriated to the University by the state. Unrestricted fund balan ces, to the extent that they were accumulated from money that was received as General Revenues, also are included and available to pay obligations secured by General Revenues. Any interest subsidy received from the federal government with respect to General Revenue Bonds is included and available to pay obligations secure d by General Revenues. (2) Invested Funds Distributions and Net Inv ested Funds Unrealized Gains and Losses These amounts represent the net interest, dividends, and realized gains or lo sses earned on the Invested Funds that are distributed to departments for operations, in addition to or offset by any unrealized gains and losses on the portfolio. (3) Adoption of Governmental Accounting Standar ds Board (GASB) Statements On July 1, 2016, the Univer sity adopted GASB Statement No . 73, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions and Related Assets That Are not within the Sc ope of GASB Statement 68, and Amendments to Certain Provisions of GASB Statements 67 and 68 . GASB Statement No . 73 requires governments to record the total actuarially determi ned pension liability; most changes in the total pension liability will now be reflected in pension expense in the period of t he change, while others will be reported as deferred inflows or deferred outflows of resources, and amortized to expense over f uture periods. Implementation of GASB Statement No. 73 resulted in the restatement of fiscal year 2017 beginni ng unrestricted net position, reducing it by $215,387,000. On July 1, 2016, the Univers ity adopted GASB Statement No. 80, Blending Requirements for Certain Component Units . GASB Statement No. 80 requires blending of a component unit's balances and activities with the primary government, and t he elimination of intra-entity transaction s, when the component unit is incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation and t he primary government is the corporation's sole corporate member. Implementation of GASB Statement No . 80 resulted in the restat ement of fiscal year 2017 beginning unrestricted net position, increasing it by $89,498,000 due to the blending of Northwest Hospital and Medical Center that was previously reflected as a discrete component unit.

WA 98101 Independent Auditors' Report We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the business-type activities and the aggregate discretely presented component unit of the University of Washington (the University) , an agency of the state of Washington, which comprise the statements of net position as of June 30, 2017, and the related statements of revenues , expenses , changes in net position, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the University 's basic financial statements . Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ; this includes the design, implementation , and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements . The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments , the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly , we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management , as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. Opinions In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the business-type activities and the aggregate discretely presented component unit of the University of Washington as of June 30, 2017, and the respective changes in financial position and cash flows thereof for the year then ended, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles . KPMG LLP is a Delaware limited liability partnership and the U.S. member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (\"KPMG International\"), a Swiss entity. B-9Emphasis of Matters As discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, the financial statements of the University of Washington, an agency of the state of Washington, are intended to present the financial position, the changes in financial position, and where applicable, cash flows of only the respective portion of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the state of Washington that are attributable to the transactions of the University of Washington and its discretely presented component unit. They do not purport to, and do not, present fairly the financial position of the state of Washington as of June 30, 2017, the changes in its financial position or, where applicable, its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles . Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. As discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, on July 1, 2016, the University adopted new accounting guidance requiring governments providing defined benefit pension plans to their employees that are not administered through a trust to record the total pension liability, as well as recognizing most changes in the total pension liability within pension expense. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. As discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, on July 1, 2016, the University adopted new accounting guidance which amends requirements for the financial statement presentation of component units of all state and local governments . As a result of this amendment the University now reports Northwest Hospital and Medical Center as a blended component unit, whereas it was presented as a discrete component in previous years. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. Other Matters Required Supplementary Information U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that the management's discussion and analysis on pages 3 through 11, and the schedules of required supplementary information on pages 43 and 44, be presented to supplement the basic financial statements . Such information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements . We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance . Other Information Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements that collectively comprise the University's basic financial statements . The accompanying information under the table of contents is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial statements . This information has not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on it. Seattle, Washington October 20, 2017 2 B-10Management's Discussion and Analysis The discussion and analysis below provides an overview of the financial position and activities of the University of Washington (University) for the year ended June 30, 2017. This discussion has been prepared by management, and since it includes highly summarized data, should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes which follow this section. Financial Highlights for Fiscal Year 2017 The University recorded an increase in net position of $363 million in fiscal year 2017, which is a $450 million improvement compared to the fiscal year 2016 decrease in net position of $87 million. Revenues from patient services and research activities continued to show growth during 2017, and together with mostly unchanged tuition revenues contributed to an overall increase in operating revenues. An increase in operating expenses was more than offset by increases in most nonoperating revenue categories, most notably investment income, which benefited from a recovery in investment market values during the year. The University adjusts the carrying value of investments to market value each year, with the change recorded as investment income or loss. Key Financial Results for Fiscal Years 2017 and 2016 (in millions) 2017 2016 Total operating revenues $4,893 $4,730 Total operating expenses 5,666 5,413 Operating loss (773) (683) State appropriations 342 302 Investment income 443 44 Gifts 166 115 Other nonoperating revenues, net 185 135 Increase (decrease) in net position 363 (87) Net position, beginning of year 6,053 6,046 Cumulative effect of accounting change (215) 94 Net position, beginning of year as restated 5,838 6,140 Net position, end of year $6,201 $6,053 Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) principles require that revenues from state appropriations, Pell grants, and gifts be considered nonoperating while the expenses funded from these revenues are categorized as operating . As a result, the University will typically reflect an operating loss on its Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position. The University implemented GASB Statement No. 73, \"Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions and Related Assets That Are Not within the Scope of GASB Statement 68, and Amendments to Certain Provisions of GASB Statements 67 and 68\" during fiscal year 2017. This statement changed how the University reports its obligation for retiree benefits associated with the University of Washington Supplemental Retirement Plan (UWSRP). Assets set aside by the University to pay future retiree benefits are not segregated in an irrevocable trust; therefore, the accounting for this single-employer defined-benefit pension plan was not impacted by the prior implementation of GASB Statement No. 68 in fiscal year 2015. Prior to implementing this Statement, the UWSRP pension liability represented the cumulative amounts expensed for the Annual Required Contribution (ARC) less cash payments to retirees, and UWSRP pension expense was equal to the ARC. Under Statement No. 73, the University must record the total actuarially determined UWSRP pension liability, and most changes in the total pension liability will now be reflected in pension expense in the period of the change, while others will be reported as deferred inflows or deferred outflows of resources and amortized to expense over future periods. With the adoption of GASB Statement No. 73, net position was restated at July 1, 2016 by a decrease of $215 million for the difference between the beginning total pension liability and the amount previously reported as the UWSRP pension liability. Fiscal year 2017 financial results reflect application of the accounting changes required by Statement No. 73, but those changes have not been applied to fiscal year 2016 amounts due to the constraints of available information. The University also implemented GASB Statement No. 80, \"Blending Requirements for Certain Component Units\" during fiscal year 2017. This Statement amends requirements for the financial statement presentation of component units, by adding a requirement to reflect a component unit as blended when it is incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation and the primary government is the corporation's sole corporate member. The University is the sole corporate member of Northwest Hospital and Medical Center (NWH), which was previously reflected as a discretely presented component unit. With the adoption of GASB Statement No. 80, NWH is now being reflected as a blended component unit of the University, and net position was restated at July 1, 2015 by an increase of $94 million. Fiscal years 2016 and 2017 in this management's discussion and analysis both reflect application of the accounting changes required by Statement No. 80. Economic Factors Affecting the Future The state of Washington, which provided 7% of the University's total revenues in fiscal year 2017, continues to emerge from the recession with moderate economic growth and commensurate increases in state tax collections . However, additional state tax collections, as well as new revenue, were largely consumed by the state's attempt to meet court-mandated increases to K-12 education funding (McCleary v. Washington). As a result, non-mandatory state programs, including higher education, did not and will not receive significant additional funding for the current 2017-19 biennium. During the 2013-15 biennium, the University committed to freezing resident undergraduate tuition rates in 2014 and 2015 in exchange for increases in state funding in both years. In the 2015-17 biennium, the state reduced resident undergraduate tuition rates to 5% below the 2015 rates in 2016, and to 15% below the 2015 rates in 2017. The state provided funds to offset the lost tuition revenue in both years. In a change from previous tuition freezes and reductions, the state will now allow a 2.2% increase to resident undergraduate tuition in 2018 and a 2.0% increase in 2019. The University's fiscal year 2018 general operating appropriation from the state (excluding amounts appropriated for specific purposes) is expected to be approximately $352 million. This Unaudited -see accompanying notes to financial statements FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 / 3 B-11Management's Discussion and Analysis (continued) amount is an increase from $332 million in 2017 and $292 million in 2016. The increase between 2017 and 2018 is largely attributable to targeted investments in compensation, medical education, and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) enrollments . The significant increase in 2017 was largely attributable to funding intended to offset tuition reductions, but also included targeted investments in medical and computer science education. The University's Board of Regents continues to have broad tuition and fee setting authority for categories other than resident undergraduate tuition. The state has yet to pass a capital budget for the 2017-19 biennium. Therefore, projects that were slated to receive funding for the beginning of 2018 will be delayed until a capital budget is approved. State funding for capital appropriations continues to be constrained, though the University expects to receive some state bonding capacity for critical capital projects once a budget is approved . The healthcare industry, in general, and the acute care hospital business, in particular, are experiencing significant regulatory uncertainty based, in large part, on legislative efforts to significantly modify or repeal and potentially replace the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 201 0 (\"Affordable Care Act'' or \"ACA\"). It is difficult to predict the full impact of these actions on the University's future revenues and operations. Changes to the ACA are likely to significantly impact the University . UW Medicine formed an Accountable Care Network (ACN) in 2014 with other selected healthcare organizations and healthcare professionals in Western Washington to assume responsibility for the healthcare of contracted patient populations to achieve the Triple Aim: improved healthcare experience for the individual, improved health of the population, and more affordable care. The ACN has contracted with the Washington Health Care Authority to participate in its Puget Sound Accountable Care Program (ACP) as a healthcare benefit option for Public Employees Benefits Board (PEBB) members. The ACP is offered to all PEBB members who reside in Snohomish, King, Kitsap, Pierce, and Thurston counties. A subset of the network members have also agreed to participate with the ACN in a contract with Premera as part of its Accountable Health System (AHS) product. As an AHS, the UW Medicine ACN will share in accountability for the quality and cost of healthcare for Premera members who select this plan. This product was sold both on and off the Washington Health Exchange in select counties with coverage that began January 1, 2016. The AHS must have 5,000 planwide members per product, per region for the UW Medicine ACN to share in financial savings and risk. The ACN was not at risk for the AHS product in 2016 and 2017. The UW Medicine ACN also entered into an agreement to provide healthcare services to nonunion employees of a large local employer with coverage that began January 1, 2015. These arrangements provide an opportunity for shared savings between the ACN and the contracted entity based on achieving quality and financial benchmarks. If certain financial benchmarks are not attained, UW Medicine, along with its network members, is at risk for reductions in payment levels from the contracted entity based on the agreement. Rising benefit costs, particularly for pensions and healthcare, continue to impact the University. Employer pension funding rates paid by the University for the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) pension plans were mostly unchanged in 2017 at 11.2% of covered salary, but will be increasing to 12.5% of covered salary in 2018. The monthly employer base rate paid for employee healthcare, however, increased 5.7% during 2017, from $840 to $888 per active employee, and will be increasing to $913 per active employee during 2018. Both rates are likely to continue increasing. Using the Financial Statements The University's financial statements are prepared in accordance with GASB principles, which establish standards for external financial reporting for public colleges and universities. GASB standards require that financial statements be presented on a consolidated basis in order to focus on the University as a whole. These financial statements include the following components: Independent Auditors' Report presents an unmodified opinion prepared by our auditors, KPMG LLP, on the fairness in all material respects of our financial statements. Statements of Net Position present the assets and deferred outflows of resources, liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, and net position of the University at a point in time Uune 30, 2017). Their purpose is to present a financial snapshot of the University . This statement aids the reader in determining the assets available to continue the University's operations, how much the University owes to employees and vendors, whether the University has any deferred outflows or inflows other than assets or liabilities, and provides a picture of net position and its availability for expenditure by the University. Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position present the total revenues earned and expenses incurred by the University for operating, nonoperating and other related activities, during a period of time (the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017). Their purpose is to assess the University's operating and nonoperating activities. Statements of Cash Flows present cash receipts and payments of the University during a period of time (the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017). Their purpose is to assess the University's ability to generate net cash flows and meet its obligations as they come due. Notes to the Financial Statements present additional information to support the financial statements. Their purpose is to clarify and expand on the information in the financial statements. Notes are referenced in this discussion to indicate where details of the financial highlights may be found. Unaudited -see accompanying notes to financial statements UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 4 B-12The University has had a strategic alliance with Valley Medical Center, a Washington public hospital district, since 2011. GASB standards require that this entity be presented as a discrete component unit of the University; therefore, its financial position at June 30, 2017, and results of operations for the year ended June 30, 2017, are reported in a separate column for financial statement presentation purposes (see Note 1 to the Financial Statements). The analysis that follows includes the consolidated balances of the University and its blended component units, but excludes the financial position and results of operations of Valley Medical Center. Financial Health STATEMENTS OF NET POSITION A summarized comparison of the University's assets, liabilities, deferrals and net position as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 follows: The University continues to maintain and protect its strong (in millions) 2017 2016 Current assets $ 1,427 $ 1,603 Noncurrent assets: Capital assets, net 4,737 4,465 Investments, net of current portion 4,721 4,155 Other 455 427 Total assets 11,340 10,650 Deferred outflows 269 185 Total assets and 11,609 10,835 liabilities 5,300 4,660 Deferred inflows 108 122 Total liabilities and deferred inflows 5,408 4,782 Net position $ 6.201 $6,053 financial foundation . This financial health, as reflected in the Statements of Net Position, results from the prudent utilization of financial resources including careful cost controls, preservation of endowment funds, conservative utilization of debt, and adherence to a long-range capital plan for the acquisition, maintenance and replacement of the physical plant. Current assets include those that may be used to support current operations, and consist primarily of cash, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Current liabilities generally are due and payable over the course of the following fiscal year, and include accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, unearned revenues, and the current portion of long-term debt. The excess of current assets over current liabilities of $112 million in 2017 and $488 million in 2016 reflects the continuing ability of the University to meet its short-term obligations. Current assets decreased $176 million in 2017, partly due to a $117 million decrease in short-term investments, and a $48 million decrease in cash. Current liabilities increased $200 million during the year, due in part to a $75 million increase in the accrual for investment purchases not yet settled, a $22 million increase in unearned revenues, and a $17 million increase in commercial paper debt. Noncurrent assets increased $866 million in 2017, driven by an increase in long-term investments of $566 million as a result of strong investment returns during the year on the University's investments, together with an increase in capital assets of $272 million. Noncurrent liabilities increased $440 million during 2017, primarily due to an increase in the University's pension liabilities. The net pension liability representing the University's proportionate share of the statewide amounts reported by the Department of Retirement Systems (DRS) increased $178 million during the year due to service cost and interest on the unfunded liability. The pension liability associated with the UWSRP increased $142 million, due to the implementation of GASB Statement No. 73 during 2017. Noncurrent liabilities also increased during the year due to an increase in long- term liabilities, primarily associated with the November, 2016 issuance of University General Revenue Bonds (see Note 11 ). Deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources primarily represent pension-related deferrals associated with the implementation of GASB Statement No. 68 in 2015, and GASB Statement No. 73 in 2017. The increase in deferred outflows of $84 million in 2017 primarily reflects the University's proportionate share of an increase in the statewide amounts reported by the DRS due to differences between projected and actual investment earnings on pension plan assets. Deferred inflows were impacted during 2017 by a corresponding reduction in the University's proportionate share of the statewide difference between projected and actual earnings on plan assets (total change for 2017 equaled $199 million). This was offset by an increase of $91 million of deferred inflows recorded for the first time in 2017 due to the implementation of GASB Statement No. 73. The difference between total assets and deferred outflows, and total liabilities and deferred inflows, is referred to as net position or \"equity''. Over time, the change in net position is one indicator of the improvement or decline in the University's overall financial health when considered with nonfinancial factors such as enrollment, research awards, patient levels, and the condition of facilities. The University reports its \"equity'' in four categories : Net Investment in Capital Assets -This is the University's total investment in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization and outstanding debt obligations related to those capital assets. Restricted Net Position: -Nonexpendable net position, primarily endowments, represents gifts to the University's permanent endowment funds. These are funds on which the donor or other external party has imposed the restriction that the corpus is not available for expenditure, but rather for investment purposes only in order to produce income that is to be expended for the purposes specified. Unaudited -see accompanying notes to financial statements FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 / 5 B-13Management's Discussion and Analysis (continued) -Expendable net position consists of resources that the University is legally or contractually obligated to spend in accordance with time or purpose restrictions placed by donors and/or other external parties, and includes the net appreciation of permanent endowments. Unrestricted Net Position -This is all other funds available to the University for any purpose associated with its mission. Unrestricted net position is not subject to externally imposed stipulations , but often is internally designated for specific purposes. The University's net position at June 30, 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows: (in millions) 2017 2016 Net investment in capital assets $ 2,425 $2,308 Restricted : Nonexpendable 1,537 1,421 Expendable 1,859 1,592 Unrestricted 380 732 Total net position $6,201 $6,053 Net investment in capital assets increased $117 million, or 5%, in 2017. This balance typically increases as debt is paid off, or when the University funds fixed asset purchases without the use of external financing , for example by using internal reserves. This balance decreases as assets are depreciated . The increase in 2017 reflects greater additions to net capital assets during the year than the associated increase in capital asset-related debt, reflecting continued capital spend on previously approved projects together with a reduced pace for new debt issuances . Restricted nonexpendable net position increased $116 million, or 8%, in 2017. This primarily reflects the receipt of new endowment gifts during the year, together with an increase in the market value of underwater endowment investments . Restricted expendable net position increased $267 million, or 17%, in 2017. This category is primarily affected by new operating and capital gifts, and earnings or losses on restricted investments, including endowments. The improvement in market value for the Consolidated Endowment Fund (CEF) was the primary reason for the increase during the year. Unrestricted net position decreased by $352 million, or 48%, in 2017 primarily due to the impact of restating fiscal year 2017 beginning net position as a result of implementing GASB Statement No. 73. The change in accounting treatment required by Statement No. 73 reduced unrestricted net position by $215 million, representing the difference between the beginning of year UWSRP total pension liability calculated under Statement No. 73, and the amount previously reported by the University under the prior basis of accounting. In addition, operating losses associated with unrestricted activities were $385 million for the year, together with interest expense on capital asset\u00ad related debt of $77 million. These were partly offset by $342 million of state operating appropriations, and $23 million of investment income on unrestricted investments. Endowment and Other Investments Investment returns provide an important source of revenue for the University's programs. Among the funds invested by the University are endowments, operating reserves, life income trusts, annuities and gifts. Endowed gifts supply permanent capital and an ongoing stream of current earnings to the University . Most endowments are commingled in the CEF, a diversified investment fund. As in a mutual fund, each individual endowment maintains a separate identity and owns units in the fund. The CEF has experienced considerable growth over the past 1 O years due to gifts and endowment returns. The number of individual endowments in the CEF has grown significantly, from 2,500 at June 30, 2007 to 4,685 atJune 30, 2017. The market value of the CEF has similarly increased from $2.1 billion at June 30, 2007 to $3.1 billion atJune 30, 2017. The impact to program support has been substantial, with $902 million distributed over the past 10 years touching every part of the University. Programs supported by endowment returns include academic programs, scholarships , fellowships, professorships, chairs and research activities. Under the Board of Regents' approved long\u00ad term spending policy for the CEF, quarterly distributions to programs are made based on an annual percentage rate of 4%, applied to the five-year rolling average of the CE F's market valuation . An additional 1 % is distributed to support fundraising and stewardship activities (0.80%) and investment management (0.20%). Similar to program distributions, the fee is based on the endowment's five-year average market value. In September of 2015, the Board of Regents approved the establishment of an internal investment management company, known as the University of Washington Investment Management Company or UWINCO. Under the new structure, the UWINCO advisory committee was transitioned to an investment company advisory board (UWINCO Board). This change reflects industry best practices and trends among other peer institutions . Endowment portfolios are commonly managed around a core set of objectives focused on the need to provide support for endowed programs in perpetuity . The Board of Regents, in conjunction with the UWINCO Board, establishes the policy asset allocation judged to be most appropriate for the University from a long-term potential return and risk perspective. The policy asset allocation is reviewed annually for its continuing fit with the University's risk profile and with consideration of the changing dynamics of the capital markets. The CEF asset allocation includes two clearly defined categories of investments : those which facilitate growth or appreciation (Capital Appreciation), and those which preserve endowment values (Capital Preservation) . At June 30, 2017, 78% of the CEF was invested in Capital Appreciation and 22% in Capital Preservation . Following an expectation that market returns for equities will exceed bonds over the next decade, a medium-term objective is maintained of generally overweighting equity-oriented strategies with a focus on quality companies and downside protection . The University also maintains ample liquidity within Capital Preservation to meet its funding requirements, as well as to take advantage of market dislocations if opportunities arise. Unaudited -see accompanying notes to financial statements UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 6 B-14V, z 0 ::; _, :;; ~ For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, the CEF returned +13.6% versus +12.4% for the passive benchmark. Absolute performance was positive across all CEF strategies. After a tough 2016, staying the course in emerging markets paid off, with the CEF's Emerging Markets Equity strategy leading absolute returns this year. The CEF's Capital Preservation portfolio substantially outperformed, while Capital Appreciation slightly underperformed largely due to weak energy markets. All major equity indexes posted strong gains in 2017, but markets are rotating in favor of non-US equities, especially emerging markets and the Eurozone. Geopolitical risks and policy uncertainty appear to be on the rise. Forecasted returns have been trending down and a lower return, high-risk environment is expected . Longer-term, the CEF has consistently maintained solid relative performance. The CEF has outperformed both the passive benchmark and public university peers with $1-5 billion for the 5, 1 0 and 20-year periods. The 20-year return for the CEF stands at +8.0%, although returns have been trending downward with the at +4.7%. $3,300 $2,800 $2,300 $1,800 $1,300 $800 Consolidated Endowment Fund Market Value (in millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 A portion of the University's operating funds are invested in the CEF. As of June 30, 2017, these funds comprise $615 million of the CEF market value. Debt and Related Capital Improvements The University's general revenue borrowing platform, established in 2003, has been used to fund buildings that support the educational, research and service missions of the institution. The University's debt portfolio consists primarily of fixed-rate debt in the form of General Revenue Bonds, Lease Revenue Bonds and state-issued bonds, as well as variable rate debt such as commercial paper. Credit ratings are a reflection of the University's strength. During fiscal year 2017, the University was rated Aaa (the highest rating) by Moody's Investors Service and AA+ by Standard & Poor's. These strong ratings carry substantial advantages for the University: continued and wider access to capital markets when the University issues debt, lower interest rates on bonds and the ability to negotiate favorable bond terms. The University takes its role offinancial stewardship seriously and works hard to manage its financial resources effectively. Continued high debt ratings are important indicators of the University's success in this area. Moody's Fiscal Year 2016 Public College and University Rating Distribution (As of the July 2017 Moody's Median Report) Aaa UW A1 A2 A3- 13 Baa- 11 0 10 20 30 NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS 48 40 so Unaudited -see accompanying notes to financial statements FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 / 7 B-15Management's Discussion and Analysis (continued) The University uses financial ratios to evaluate institutional health and to inform planning for future debt issuances. Each ratio is defined by Moody's Investors Service, and reflects year\u00ad to-year changes at the University as well as how those results trend against other Aaa-rated peer schools. Spendable Cash and Investments to Total Debt is the ratio of all available resources to pay debt, Total Debt to Operating Revenue is a measure of financial leverage, and Annual Debt Service Coverage is a measure of cash flow available to pay debt obligations. Although ratio results are an important aspect of the University's credit rating, many other factors also play a large role such as state demographics, the strength of the University's research enterprise and student demand. 3.0 2.5 0 ;::: 2.0 <( 0:: 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 Spendable Cash and Investments to Total Debt 2017 2016 2.5 Moody's Public Universities (Aaa median 2016) This ratio shows that in 2017 the University had sufficient nonrestricted cash and investments to pay its outstanding debt 1.7 times.

In November 2016, the University issued $205 million of General Revenue Bonds with an average coupon of $4.80%. A portion of the proceeds was used to refund General Revenue Bonds originally issued in 2008. The balance was used to fund various projects including construction of new residential housing, a new Life Sciences building, research facilities, and expansion of the UW Medical Center. The University continues to expand its campuses and renovate existing facilities to meet the needs of its students, faculty and staff. Significant capital asset expenditures (greater than $20 million) during fiscal year 2017 included $58 million for the McCarty Hall demolition and construction, $57 million for the Life Sciences Building, $31 million for Washington Biomedical Research Properties 3.2, and $30 million for the Burke Museum Building. Key projects placed in service during 2017 include: UW Animal Research and Care Facility- $131 million. A two-story research facility constructed below ground level. Nano-engineering & Sciences Building -$72 million. Completed buildout of facilities for classrooms and offices for instruction, in addition to providing capacity for future College of Engineering vibration and EMI sensitive programs. Workday HR & Payroll System -$61 million. A cloud-based software-as-a-service suite to centralize and standardize human resources and payroll processes across three campuses, the Medical Centers and other off-site facilities. Denny Hall Renovation -$50 million. This project included exterior work, masonry repair, and replacement of electrical, lighting, mechanical and communications systems. West Campus Utility Plant -$44 million. Supplies chilled water and emergency power to energy-intensive research buildings in the southwestern corner of the University. UW Medical Center Expansion Phase 2 -$26 million. This project included a buildout of surgical prep/recovery areas, pharmacy, and laboratory. UW Tacoma (UWT) Urban Solutions Center -$25 million. Renovation of the Tacoma Paper & Stationery Building, a 40,000 square foot, four-story historic building located between the existing UWT Science and Dougan Buildings . Creates capacity to dramatically expand programs in engineering, environmental sciences, GIS, general engineering and big data computing. UW Police Department (UWPD) -$21 million. Provides a replacement facility for the UWPD, which was formerly located in the Bryants Building. Unaudited -see accompanying notes to financial statement s UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 8 B-16STATEMENTS OF REVENUES, EXPENSES AND CHANGES IN NET POSITION The Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position present the University's results of operations and nonoperating items that result in the changes in net position for the year. In accordance with GASB reporting principles, revenues and expenses are classified as either operating or nonoperating. A condensed comparison of the University's revenues, expenses and changes in net position for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 follows: (in millions) 2017 2016 Total operating revenues $ 4,893 $ 4,730 Total operating expenses 5,666 5,413 Operating loss (773) (683) Nonoperating revenues, net of expenses 934 447 Other revenues 202 149 Increase (decrease) in net position 363 (87) Net position, beginning of year 6,053 6,046 Cumulative effect of accounting change (215) 94 Net position, beginning of year as restated 5,838 6,140 Net position, end of year $ 6,201 $ 6,053 The University has a diversified revenue base. No single source generated more than 31 % of the total fiscal year 2017 revenues of $6.1 billion. Sources of Funds ~--- 2% OTHER 23% GRANTS AND - CONTRACTS 15% TUITION AND FEES 7% STATE FUNDING FOR -OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES -31% PATIENT SERVICES The following table summarizes revenues from all sources for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016: (in millions) Tuition and fees Patient services Grants and contracts Sales and services of educational departments Auxiliary enterprises State funding for operations Gifts Investment income State funding for capital projects Other Total revenue -all sources 2017 $ 942 1,869 1,422 217 374 342 289 443 64 145 $6,107 2016 $ 949 1,788 1,347 223 349 302 221 44 39 138 $ 5,400 Grant Revenue One of the largest sources of revenue (23%) continues to be grants and contracts. Total grant and contract revenue increased $75 million, or 6% in 2017. Federal revenue increased $35 million or 4%, as several large, long-term projects received supplemental funding during the year from both the Centers for Disease Control and the Office of Naval Research. The University's largest project that was funded by federal revenue during 2017 involved the refurbishing of a 25-year-old research vessel, RN Thomas G. Thompson. With an original lifespan of 30 years, federal funding will extend the vessel's capability to operate for another 20 to 25 years. Consistent with 2016, nongovernmental revenue saw a double-digit (12%) increase which was largely attributable to The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's continued support of the University's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation . Grants and contracts provide the opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students to work with nationally recognized faculty in research as part of their educational experience. Grant and contract revenue is earned when direct expenditures (such as researchers' compensation or purchases of goods and services) are made; therefore, there is little effect on the University's operating margin as a result of this direct expense reimbursement process. Facility and administrative expenses necessary to support grants and contracts are reimbursed by sponsors, along with direct costs, by an indirect cost recovery. The current indirect cost recovery rate for research grants is approximately 30 cents on every direct expenditure dollar. Primary Nongrant Funding Sources The University relies primarily on student tuition and fees and state appropriations as revenue sources to support its nongrant-funded educational operating expenses. State support for education has increased during the last few fiscal years, but is still significantly below historical levels.

Revenue from tuition and fees decreased slightly to $942 million in fiscal year 2017, from $949 million in 2016. These amounts are net of scholarship allowances of $159 million in 2017, and $145 million in 2016. The stability in tuition revenue between Unaudited -see accompanying notes to financial statements FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 / 9 B-17Management's Discussion and Analysis (continued) 2016 and 2017 was due to a combination of factors. In accordance with a state legislative mandate, the operating fee rate (which is the main component of student tuition) for resident undergraduate students decreased by 10.5%. This decrease, however, was offset by a 2% increase in the operating fee rate for nonresident undergraduates, by 0-10% increases in the operating fee rates for graduate and professional student categories, and by 3-5% increases in fee rates for fee-based programs. Increases varied by program. The decrease in the resident undergraduate operating fee rate was also partially offset by enrollment growth. Full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment in undergraduate tuition-and fee-based programs increased by 2.6% in the resident student category, and by 0.4% in the nonresident student category. FTE enrollment in graduate and professional tuition-and fee\u00ad based programs increased by 0.3% in the resident student category and by 2.1 % in the nonresident student category. Fees for self-sustaining educational programs (fee-supported programs) include the following amounts for fiscal years 2017 and 2016: UW Continuum College (the continuing education branch of the University) $113 million and $108 million, respectively, summer quarter tuition $50 million and $54 million, respectively, and for the combination of Business School and School of Medicine programs $50 million and $50 million, respectively. Patient Services-UW Medicine The financial statements of the University include the operations of the School of Medicine, three hospitals, associated physician group and clinics, Airlift Northwest, and the University's share of two joint ventures. These entities, together with Harborview Medical Center (not included in the University's financial statements -see Note 13) and shared services providing IT, accounting, finance and revenue cycle services, comprise UW Medicine, an umbrella organization serving to coordinate these activities and promote quality healthcare in the Pacific Northwest and beyond, and to conduct cutting-edge medical research with worldwide benefit. Patient care activities included in the University's financial statements include: UW Medical Center (UWMC) is a 529-bed hospital that provides comprehensive healthcare services to the Puget Sound community and patients from throughout the Pacific Northwest and beyond. UWMC also serves as the major clinical, teaching and research site for students and faculty in the Health Sciences at the University. Nearly 19,000 patients receive inpatient care at UWMC each year. Specialized inpatient care needs are met by the Cancer Center, the Regional Heart Center, the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and the Organ Transplantation program. Valley Medical Center (VMC) is a 321-bed acute care hospital and network of clinics that treats over 18,000 inpatients per year, and is the oldest and largest public district hospital in the state of Washington. VMCjoined UW Medicine in July, 2011. VMC's Statement of Net Position and Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position are presented in a discrete column on the financial statements of the University. Northwest Hospital & Medical Center is a full-service medical facility with 281 beds, and treats approximately 10,000 inpatients per year. NWH joined UW Medicine in January, 2010. Specialized patient needs are met by the Stroke Center, Multiple Sclerosis Center, and other inpatient and outpatient services to the surrounding community. UW Neighborhood Clinics is a network of clinics with 12 neighborhood locations throughout the greater Puget Sound area, providing primary, urgent and selected specialty care with a staff of 120 healthcare providers. UW Physicians is the physician practice group for more than 2,200 faculty physicians and healthcare providers associated with UW Medicine . Airlift Northwest is the preeminent provider of air medical transport services in the Pacific Northwest. The University is also a participant in two joint ventures: Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and Children's University Medical Group. The University's share of these activities is reflected in the University's financial statements. In combination, these organizations (not including VMC) contributed $1,869 million in patient services revenue in fiscal year 2017 and $1,788 million in fiscal year 2016. UWMC generated 60% of this revenue in both 2017 and 2016. UWMC admissions were 18,964 in 2017, a 3% increase from 2016. Average patient length of stay was 7.0 days, down slightly from 7.2 days in 2016. The increase in patient services revenue during 2017 was primarily due to strong case volumes in surgeries, cardiology, and radiation oncology. Gifts, Endowments and Investment Revenues Net investment income for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 consisted of the following: (in millions) 2017 2016 Interest and dividends $ 78 $ 68 Metropolitan Tract net income 23 22 Seattle Cancer Care Alliance increase in equity 15 19 Net appreciation (depreciation) of fair value of 337 (54) investments Investment expenses (10) (11) Net investment income $ 443 $ 44 Net appreciation (depreciation) includes both realized and unrealized gains and losses. The unrealized gains, however, are not available until the underlying securities have been sold. Net investment income increased by $399 million in 2017, primarily due to the change in realized and unrealized gains and losses during the year. Unaudited -see accompanying notes to financial statements UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 10 B-18Donor support increased by $68 million, or 31 %, to $289 million in 2017 from $221 million in 2016. Gifts are a key and necessary source of support for a variety of purposes including capital improvements, scholarships, research, and endowments for various academic and research positions. Expenses Two primary functions of the University, instruction and research, comprised 35% of total operating expenses. These dollars provided instruction to nearly 57,000 students and funded over 5,100 research awards. Medical-related expenses, such as those related to patient care, also continue to be one of the largest individual components. Uses of Funds 6% DEPRECIATION/---~ AMORTIZATION -21% INSTRUCTION 29% MEDICAL RELATED - -14% RESEARCH A comparative summary of the University's expenses by functional classification (purpose for which the costs are incurred) for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 follows: (in millions) 2017 2016 Operating expenses: Educational and general instruction $1,204 $1,172 Research 768 751 Public service 39 39 Academic support 507 398 Student services 49 47 Institutional support 240 267 Operation and maintenance of plant 206 239 Scholarships and fellowships 137 156 Auxiliary enterprises 495 422 Medical-related 1,658 1,580 Depreciation/amortization 363 342 Total operating expenses $ 5,666 $ 5,413 Overall, the University's operating expenses increased by $253 million, or 5%, during 2017. Salaries expense increased $129 million, or 5%, due to employee merit increases and a modest increase in FTE's. Expenses associated with employee benefits increased $76 million, or 10%, primarily due to higher costs paid by the University for employee healthcare, and increased costs commensurate with higher salaries expense. A roughly $34 million increase in pension costs associated with the University's proportionate share of the statewide defined-benefit plans was offset by a $30 million reduction in pension expense associated with the UWSRP as a result of implementing GASB Statement No. 73. Amounts paid for supplies and materials increased $29 million, or 5%, partly associated with medical supplies used by the University's clinical operations, as well as costs associated with refurbishing the RN Thompson research vessel (reimbursed by federal grant revenue). Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $21 million, or 6%, during 2017 due to the additional capital assets placed in service by the University during the year. The ratio of spendable cash and investments to operating expenses (as defined by Moody's Investors Service) measures the strength of available resources to cover annual operating expenses . This ratio, illustrated in the chart below, shows that in 2017 the University had sufficient available resources to fund operations for a period of 9.6 months. w 1.4 l.!J < 1.2 a: w > 1.0 0 u 0.8 u. 0 0.6 VI a: 0.4 < w 0.2 > 0.0 Spendable Cash and Investments to Operating Expenses 2017 2016 1.3 Moody's Public Universities (Aaa median 2016) Operating Loss The University's operating loss increased to $773 million in 2017, from $683 million in 2016. State appropriations are shown as nonoperating revenue, pursuant to GASB standards. If state appropriations were classified as operating revenue, the operating loss would have been $431 million in 2017, and $381 million in 2016. The University continues to rely on nonoperating revenues such as gift revenues and investment income distributions, in addition to state appropriations, to fund its operations.

Dollars in thousands FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 / 15 UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON Year Ended June 30, 2017 $ $ $ $ Financial Statements NOTE 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies FINANCIAL REPORTING ENTITY The University of Washington (University), an agency of the state of Washington, is governed by a 10-member Board of Regents appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state senate. The financial statements include the individual schools, colleges and departments of the University, the University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC), Portage Bay Insurance (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the University) and certain affiliated operations determined to be a part of the University's financial reporting entity. Affiliated organizations are evaluated for inclusion in the reporting entity as component units based on the significance of their relationship with the University . Harborview Medical Center (HMC), a component unit of King County, Washington, is a related party to the University, but is not reflected as part of the financial reporting entity (Note 13). Component units are legally separate organizations for which the University is financially accountable . Financial accountability is demonstrated when one of several conditions exist such as when the University appoints a voting majority of the organization's board, is able to impose its will on the organization, receives specific financial benefit or incurs specific financial burdens from the organization, or the organization is fiscally dependent on the University. These entities may be reported in the financial statements of the University in one of two ways: the component units' amounts may be blended with the amounts reported by the University, or they may be shown in a separate column, depending on the application of the criteria of Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) code section 2600, \"Reporting Entity and Component Unit Presentation and Disclosure\". All component units of the University meet the criteria for blending except Valley Medical Center. It is reported discretely, since it has a separate board of directors, it does not provide services exclusively to the University, and it is not a nonprofit corporation with the University being the sole corporate member. CHANGES IN REPORTING ENTITY In fiscal year 2017, the University implemented GASB Statement No. 80, \"Blending Requirements for Certain Component Units\". Northwest Hospital & Medical Center, previously presented as a discrete component unit, meets the revised criteria for blending in the University's financial statements since it is a nonprofit corporation and the University is the sole corporate member. As such, its financial activities have been aggregated with those of the University, and intra-entity transactions have been eliminated. BLENDED COMPONENT UNITS The following entities are presented as blended component units of the University. Financial information for these affiliated organizations is available from their respective administrative offices. MEDICAL ENTITIES Northwest Hospital UW Medicine and Northwest Hospital & Medical Center (NWH), a 281-bed full-service acute care hospital, have been affiliated since January 1, 2010. The University is the sole corporate member of NWH. NWH had operating revenues of $358,580,000 in 2017. The Association of University Physicians dba UW Physicians (UWP) UWP was established as a tax-exempt entity for the exclusive benefit of the University of Washington School of Medicine (UWSOM). UWP employs UWSOM faculty and bills and collects for their clinical services as an agent for UWSOM. UWP had operating revenues of $262,682,000 in 2017. uw Medicine Neighborhood Clinics (Neighborhood Clinics) Neighborhood Clinics was established as a tax-exempt entity for the benefit of UWSOM, UWP and its affiliated medical centers, HMC and UWMC, exclusively for charitable, scientific and educational purposes. Neighborhood Clinics was organized to coordinate and develop patient care in a community clinical setting. They enhance the academic environment of UWSOM by providing additional sites of primary care practice and training for faculty, residents and students. Neighborhood Clinics had operating revenues of $29,332,000 in 2017. UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 16 B-24REAL ESTATE ENTITIES The entities listed below are nonprofit corporations that were formed to acquire or construct certain real properties for the benefit of the University in fulfilling its educational, medical or scientific research missions. These entities issue tax-exempt and taxable bonds to finance these activities. Washington Biomedical Research Properties I Washington Biomedical Research Properties II Washington Biomedical Research Facilities 3 Washington Biomedical Research Properties 3.2 Washington Biomedical Research Properties 3.3 These entities collectively had net capital assets of $294,448,000, and long-term debt of $410,374,000, in 2017. These amounts are reflected in the University's financial statements. DISCRETELY PRESENTED COMPONENT UNIT Valley Medical Center UW Medicine and Public Hospital District No. 1 of King County, a Washington public hospital district dba Valley Medical Center (VMC), have had a strategic alliance since July 1, 2011. VMC owns and operates a 321-bed full-service acute care hospital and 45 clinics located throughout southeast King County. The audited financial statements ofVMC are available by contacting VMC at 400 S. 43rd Street, Renton, Washington 98055 or online at the following address: valleymed .org/ about-us/financial-information . JOINT VENTURES The University, together with Seattle Children's Hospital and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, established the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA). The SCCA integrates the cancer research, teaching and clinical cancer programs of all three institutions to provide state-of-the-art cancer care. Each member of the SCCA has a one-third interest. The University accounts for its interest in the SCCA under the equity method and has recorded $141,817,000 in Other Assets, together with $15,181,000 in Investment Income, for its share of the joint venture in 2017. The University and Seattle Children's Hospital established Children's University Medical Group (CUMG) to assist the organizations in carrying out their pediatric patient care, charitable, educational. and scientific missions. CUMG employs UWSOM faculty physicians, and bills and collects for their services as an agent for UWSOM. The University records revenue from CUMG based on the income distribution plan effective December 31, 2008. The University's patient services receivable (Note 5) includes amounts due from CUMG of $16,182,000 in 2017. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The financial statements of the University have been prepared in accordance with GASB Statement No. 34, \"Basic Financial Statements -and Management's Discussion and Analysis -for State and Local Governments,\" as amended by GASB Statement No. 35, \"Basic Financial Statements -and Management's Discussion and Analysis -for Public Colleges and Universities.\"The University is reporting as a special-purpose government engaged in business-type activities (BTA). In accordance with BTA reporting, the University presents Management's Discussion and Analysis, Statements of Net Position, Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position, Statement of Cash Flows and Notes to the Financial Statements. The financial statements are prepared using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting . Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenue is recognized when earned, and expense is recorded when an obligation has been incurred. Significant intra-entity transactions have been eliminated . The University reports capital assets net of accumulated depreciation/amortization (as applicable), and reports depreciation/amortization expense in the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position. On July 1, 2016, the University adopted those portions of GASB Statement No. 73, \"Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions and Related Assets That Are Not within the Scope of GASB Statement 68, and Amendments to Certain Provisions of GASB Statements 67 and 68\" pertaining to pension plans not within the scope of Statement No. 68. The University of Washington Supplemental Retirement Plan (UWSRP, Note 15) does not fall within the scope of Statement No. 68 since the assets set aside to pay retiree benefits have not been segregated and restricted in a trust or equivalent arrangement. As a result of implementing this Statement, the University has recognized the total pension liability for this plan, and has restated July 1, 2016 Net Position for the difference between the beginning total pension liability and the amount previously reported as FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 / 17 B-25Notes to Financial Statements (continued) the UWSRP pension liability. Prior to implementing this Statement, the UWSRP pension liability represented the cumulative amounts expensed for the Annual Required Contribution (ARC) less cash payments to retirees, and UWSRP pension expense was equal to the ARC. Under Statement No. 73, the University must record the total actuarially determined UWSRP pension liability, and most changes in the total pension liability will now be reflected in pension expense in the period of the change, while others will be reported as deferred inflows or deferred outflows of resources, and amortized to expense over future periods. The University's Statement of Net Position, Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position, and the Statement of Cash Flows present only one fiscal year, since the change in accounting treatment required by Statement No. 73 is not able to be applied to the prior fiscal year due to the constraints of available information. On July 1, 2016, the University adopted GASB Statement No. 80, \"Blending Requirements for Certain Component Units\". This Statement amends requirements for the financial statement presentation of component units of all state and local governments. The new criteria require presenting a component unit's balances and activities blended with the primary government, and the elimination of intra-entity transactions, when the component unit is incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation and the primary government is the corporation's sole corporate member. The University is the sole corporate member of NWH, which was previously reflected as a discretely presented component unit. As a result of implementing this Statement, NWH is now being reflected as a blended component unit, and the July 1, 2016 net position has been restated to reflect this change. With the adoption of GASB Statements No. 73 and No. 80, net position was restated at July 1, 2016. Below is a reconciliation of total net position as previously reported at June 30, 2016, to the restated net position. (Dollars in thousands) NET POSITION AT JUNE 30, 2016, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED ADOPTION OF GASB STATEMENT NO. 73 ADOPTION OF GASB STATEMENT NO. 80 NET POSITION AT JULY 1, 2016, AS RESTATED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IMPACTING THE FUTURE $ 5,963,888 (215,387) 89,498 $ 5,837,999 In June 2015, the GASB issued Statement No. 75, \"Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions\" (OPEB), which will be effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. This Statement establishes standards of accounting and financial reporting for defined benefit OPEB and defined contribution OPEB that are provided to the employees of state and local governmental employers . The University's participation in OPEB is described in Note 14, and based on the requirements of GASB Statement No. 45, \"Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions,\" OPEB does not currently impact the University's financial statements. As a result of implementing Statement No. 75, the University will be required to recognize its proportionate share of the state's actuarially determined OPEB liability, deferred inflows and deferred outflows of resources, and benefit expense. The July 2017 actuarial valuation prepared in accordance with GASB Statement No. 45 reports an actuarial accrued liability for the state of Washington of $5,500,000,000, and estimates the University's proportionate share of that liability to be $1,200,000,000. The plan has no accumulated assets; therefore, the impact to the University's financial statements from implementation will require recognition of the University's proportionate share of the statewide OPEB liability as calculated under the requirements of GASB 75, with a corresponding restatement of net position as of June 30, 2017. In March 2016, the GASB issued Statement No. 81, \"Irrevocable Split-Interest Agreements,\" which will be effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. Irrevocable split-interest agreements are a specific type of giving arrangement used by donors to provide resources to two or more beneficiaries, including governments. This Statement requires that a government that receives resources pursuant to an irrevocable split-interest agreement recognize assets, liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources at the inception of the agreement. Implementation of this Statement will require the University to report its beneficial interest in irrevocable split-interest agreements, including those held by an intermediary such as an outside trust. The University has lead income rights in many outside trusts. This Statement will require that the beneficial interest received be initially recorded at fair value as a deferred inflow of resources, and then revalued at the end of each financial reporting period with the change in fair value recognized as revenue. The University currently reports revenue based on income distributions received. As a result of implementing this statement, the University expects to recognize additional assets of approximately $100,000,000, deferred inflows of resources of $150,000,000, and a reduction of net position of $50,000,000. UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 18 B-26In November 2016, the GASB issued Statement No. 83, \"Certain Asset Retirement Obligations,\"which will be effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. An Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) is a legally enforceable liability associated with the retirement of a tangible capital asset. Governments that have legal obligations to perform future tangible asset retirement activities will need to recognize a liability and offsetting deferred outflow of resources when incurred and reasonably estimable. The basis of the estimate is the current value of the future outlays expected to be incurred, and is to be adjusted annually for inflation and any changes of relevant factors. The deferral is to be recognized as expense in a systematic and rational manner over the life of the tangible capital asset. The liability is derecognized as retirement costs are paid. Required disclosures include information about the nature of a government's AROs, the methods and assumptions used for the estimates of the liabilities, and the estimated remaining useful life of the associated tangible capital assets. The University's 2015 Decommissioning Funding Plan, prepared in accordance with Washington Administrative Code 246-235-075, has estimated disposal and clean-up costs related to several Cyclotrons used in research and medical services of approximately $100,000,000 and discussions are underway to determine the applicability of this standard to University X-ray and MRI machines. In January 2017, the GASB issued Statement No. 84, \"Fiduciary Activities,\" which will be effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020. This Statement establishes criteria for identifying fiduciary activities of all state and local governments. Governments with activities meeting the criteria should present a Statement of Fiduciary Net Position and a Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. Custodial assets held for three months or less are exempt from the reporting requirements. The University will be required to report fiduciary activities that do not meet the exception criteria, primarily consisting of funds invested by other agencies and organizations in the Consolidated Endowment Fund. In March 2017, the GASB issued Statement No. 85, \"Omnibus 207 7,\"which will be effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. This Statement addresses practice issues that were identified during implementation and application of certain other GASB Statements. It addresses a variety of topics including issues related to blending component units, goodwill, fair value measurement and application, and OPEB. The guidance related to component units, fair value measurement and goodwill does not apply to the University . The guidance related to OPEB will be considered in the context of implementing GASB Statement No. 75. In June 2017, the GASB issued Statement No. 87, \"Leases,\"which will be effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021. This Statement changes the current classification of lease arrangements as either operating or capital leases, and establishes a single model for lease accounting based on the foundational principle that leases represent a financing transaction associated with the right to use an underlying asset. This Statement applies to contracts that convey the right to use a non-financial asset in an exchange or exchange-like transaction for a term exceeding 12 months. Lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability and an intangible right-to-use lease asset, and lessors will be required to recognize a lease receivable and a deferred inflow of resources . The University is currently analyzing the impact from implementation of this Statement. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles involves management estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, deferrals, revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates; however, in each case, the University believes that allowances, reserves and estimates of expected liabilities are adequate . The University estimates the pollution remediation liability (Note 9) by reviewing the current status of known polluted sites and developing estimates of cleanup costs. These estimates are subject to change due to improvements in technology, inflation, changes in the scope of work, and the pursuit of reimbursement from other responsible parties. Allowances (Notes 4 and 5) are estimates based on the historical experience of the University and current economic circumstances with respect to the collectability of accounts and loans receivable. The University's share of pension plan assets, liabilities, deferrals and expenses, are based on actuarial valuations prepared by an external actuary. The results of an actuarial valuation are estimates based on historical data, actuarial assumptions, and the demographics of the employee population . The self-insurance reserve (Note 16) is estimated through an externally prepared actuarial calculation using individual case-basis valuations and statistical analyses. Considerable variability is inherent in such estimates. FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 / 19 B-27Notes to Financial Statements (continued) OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES Investments. Investments are generally carried at fair value. The fair value of all debt and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value is based on quotations from major securities exchanges. Alternative investments, which are not readily marketable, are carried at the estimated fair values provided by the investment managers. The University reviews and evaluates the values provided by the investment managers and agrees with the valuation methods and assumptions used in determining the fair value of the alternative investments . Those estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for these securities existed. Investments under long-term strategies are considered noncurrent . Short-term investments consist primarily of cash equivalents and fixed income vehicles which management has identified as available to meet the day-to-day obligations of the University . Inventories. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value and are reflected on the Statements of Net Position in Other Current Assets. Consumable inventories, consisting of expendable materials and supplies, are generally valued using the weighted-average method. Merchandise inventories are generally valued using the first-in, first-out method. Capital Assets. Land, buildings, equipment, library books and intangibles are stated at cost or, if acquired by gift, at fair market value at the date of the gift. Additions, replacements, major repairs and renovations are capitalized. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 15 to 50 years for building components, 20 to 50 years for infrastructure and land improvements, 5 to 7 years for equipment, 15 years for library books, and 3 to 15 years for intangibles . Capital assets which are financed by capital leases are depreciated in the same manner as other capital assets. Interest incurred on capital asset-related debt was $90,080,000 in 2017. The University capitalized $12,694,000 of this cost in 2017. Unearned Revenues. Unearned revenues occur when funds have been collected in advance of when the associated goods or services have been provided, such as advance ticket sales, summer quarter tuition and unspent cash advances on certain grants. Cost-Sharing Pension Plans. The net pension asset or liability is measured as the University's proportionate share of the collective total pension liability, less the fiduciary net position, of the cost-sharing pension plans in which the University participates . The total pension liability is determined by discounting projected benefit payments based on the benefit terms and legal agreements existing at the pension plan's fiscal year-end. Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted using a single rate that reflects the expected rate of return on investments, to the extent that plan assets are available to pay benefits. The University's proportionate share is determined based on the relationship of University contributions to total contributions to the plan by all participating employers. Pension expense is recognized for benefits earned during the period, interest on the unfunded liability and changes in benefit terms. Differences between expected and actual experience, and changes in assumptions about future economic or demographic factors, are reported as deferred inflows of resources or deferred outflows of resources, and are recognized over the average expected remaining service period for employees eligible for pension benefits. Differences between expected and actual investment returns are reported as deferred inflows of resources or deferred outflows of resources, and are recognized over five years. Contributions made to the plan subsequent to the measurement date and prior to the University's fiscal year-end are reported as a deferred outflow of resources, and recognized in the subsequent fiscal year. The measurement date for the cost-sharing plans in which the University participates is June 30 of the prior fiscal year. Single Employer Pension Plan (UW Supplemental Retirement Plan). The total pension liability is determined by discounting projected benefit payments for current participants and retirees, based on the benefit terms and legal agreements existing at the pension plan's fiscal year-end. The discount rate used is the yield or index rate for 20 year tax-exempt general obligation municipal bonds with average credit rating M/Aa or higher rating. Pension expense is recognized for benefits earned during the period, interest on the unfunded liability and changes in benefit terms. Differences between expected and actual experience, and changes in assumptions about future economic or demographic factors, are reported as deferred inflows of resources or deferred outflows of resources, and are recognized over the average expected remaining service period for employees eligible for pension benefits. The measurement date for the UW Supplemental Retirement Plan is June 30, 2017. Split-Interest Agreements. Under such agreements, donors/beneficiaries receive income for their lifetime or for a stated term, with the University receiving the remaining principal. The University records an asset related to these agreements at fair market value at year-end. The University also records a liability related to the split-interest agreements equal to the present value of expected future distributions; the discount rates applied range from 3.4% to 7.5%. UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 20 B-28Compensated Absences. University employees accrue annual leave at rates based on length of service, and for sick leave at the rate of one day per month. Sick leave balances, which are unlimited, can be converted to monetary compensation annually at 25% of the employees' normal compensation rate for any balance that exceeds 480 hours, or for any balance upon retirement or death. Annual leave accrued at June 30, 2017 was $118,917,000, and is included in Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities. Sick leave accrued atJune 30, 2017 was $46,771,000, and is included in Long\u00ad Term Liabilities (Note 9). Scholarship Allowances. Tuition and Fees are reported net of scholarship allowances that are applied to students' accounts from external funds that have already been recognized as revenue by the University. Student aid paid directly to students is reported as scholarships and fellowships expense. Net Patient Service Revenue. Patient service revenue is recorded at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients, third-party payors and others for services rendered, including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third-party payors. Retroactive adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined . Revenue related to charity care provided to patients is excluded from net patient service revenue. Third-party payor agreements with Medicare and Medicaid provide for payments at amounts different from established rates and are part of contractual adjustments to net patient service revenue. Medicare reimbursements are based on a tentative rate, with final settlement determined after submission of annual cost reports and audits thereof by the Medicare fiscal intermediary. The estimated final settlements for open years are based on preliminary cost findings after giving consideration to interim payments that have been received on behalf of patients covered under these programs . For more information about Net Patient Service Revenue, see the audited financial statements of the UW Medicine Clinical Enterprise -UW Division, which are contained in the latest Bondholders Report at http://finance.uw .edu/ treasury/bondholders/other-investor-material . Charity Care. Charity care provides patient care without charge to patients who meet certain criteria under the charity care policy. Records are maintained to identify and monitor the level of charity care provided. These records include charges foregone for services and supplies furnished under the charity care policy to the uninsured and the underinsured. Collection of these amounts is not pursued and as such they are not reported as net patient service revenue. The cost of charity care provided is calculated based on the aggregate relationship of costs to charges. The estimated cost of charity care provided during 2017 was $21,346,000 . State Appropriations. The state of Washington appropriates funds to the University on both annual and biennial bases. This revenue is reported as nonoperating revenue in the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position when underlying expenditures are made. Operating Activities. The University's policy for reporting operating activities in the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position is to include activities that generally result from exchange transactions. Examples of exchange transactions are payments received for tuition, patient services or grants under which services are performed, as well as payments made for the delivery of goods or services. Certain other significant revenue streams used for operations, such as state appropriations, Pell grants, gifts and investment income are recorded as nonoperating revenues, as prescribed by GASB Statement No. 35. Net Position. The University's net position is classified as follows: Net investment in capital assets: The University's investments in capital assets, less accumulated depreciation/ amortization, net of outstanding debt obligations related to capital assets; Restricted net position -nonexpendable: Net position subject to externally-imposed requirements that it be maintained permanently by the University, including permanent endowment funds and annuity and life income trusts; Restricted net position -expendable: Net position that the University is obligated to spend in accordance with restrictions imposed by external parties, generally for scholarships, research and departmental uses; Unrestricted net position: Net position not subject to externally-imposed restrictions, but which may be designated for specific purposes by management or the Board of Regents. Tax Exemption. The University, as an agency of the state of Washington, is not subject to federal income tax pursuant to Section 115 of the Internal Revenue Code, except for tax on unrelated business income and certain federal excise taxes. FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 / 21 B-29Notes to Financial Statements (continued) NOTE 2: Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash includes cash on hand, petty cash and bank deposits. Cash equivalents includes treasury securities with maturities of less than 90 days and money market funds with remaining maturities of one year or less at the time of purchase. Most cash, except for cash held at the University and cash held in foreign banks, is covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), or if greater than FDIC limits, by collateral held in a multiple financial institution collateral pool administered by the Washington Public Deposit Protection Commission (PDP(). NOTE 3: Deposit with State of Washington State law requires the University to deposit certain funds with the state treasurer, who holds and invests the funds. These deposits include amounts held for the University's permanent land grant funds, and the University building fee collected from students. The fair value of these funds approximates the carrying value. NOTE 4: Student Loans Receivable Net student loans of $69,381,000 at June 30, 2017 consist of $53,281,000 from federal programs, and $16,100,000 from University programs. Interest income from student loans for the year ended June 30, 2017 was $1,606,000. These unsecured loans are made primarily to students who reside in the state of Washington. NOTE 5: Accounts Receivable The major components of accounts receivable as of June 30, 2017 were: (Dollars in thousands) 2017 NET PATIENT SERVICES $ 351,566 GRANTS AND CONTRACTS 182,191 INVESTMENTS 95,232 DUE FROM OTHER AGENCIES 78,207 SALES AND SERVICES 52,294 TUITION 13,451 5,021 ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS (70,099) TOTAL $ 721,730 UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 22 B-30NOTE 6: Investments INVESTMENTS -GENERAL The University of Washington Board of Regents is vested by statute with responsibility for the University's properties and investments , and for establishing investment policy. The University of Washington Investment Management Company (UWINCO), led by the Chief Investment Officer, carries out the day-to-day activities of the investment portfolios. The University of Washington Investment Management Company Board, which consists of both Board of Regents' members and external investment professionals , serves as an advisory board to UWINCO. The University holds significant amounts of investments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Shown below is a tabular format for disclosing the levels within the fair value hierarchy . The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized as follows: Level 1 Inputs -Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that a government can access at the measurement date Level 2 Inputs -Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for an asset or liability, either directly or indirectly Level 3 Inputs -Unobservable inputs for an asset or liability (Dollars in thousands) INVESTMENTS BY FAIR VALUE LEVEL FIXED INCOME SECURITIES U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY MORTGAGE BACKED ASSET BACKED CORPORATE AND OTHER TOTAL FIXED INCOME SECURITIES EQUITY SECURITIES GLOBAL EQUITY INVESTMENTS PRIVATE EQUITY AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS REAL ESTATE OTHER TOTAL EQUITY SECURITIES TOTAL INVESTMENTS BY FAIR VALUE LEVEL INVESTMENTS MEASURED USING NET ASSET VALUE (NAV) GLOBAL EQUITY INVESTMENTS ABSOLUTE RETURN STRATEGY FUNDS PRIVATE EQUITY AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS REAL ASSETS FUNDS OTHER TOTAL INVESTMENTS MEASURED USING NAV TOTAL INVESTMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE CASH EQUIVALENTS AT AMORTIZED COST TOTAL Measurement Inputs Quoted Prices in Active Significant Other Markets for Identical Observable Inputs Assets (Level 1) (Level 2) $ 12,008 FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 / 23 B-31Notes to Financial Statements (continued) Fixed income and equity securities classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy are valued using prices quoted in active markets for those securities . Fixed income and equity securities classified in Level 2 are valued using other observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities and interest rates. Private equity, real assets and other investments classified in Level 3 are valued using either discounted cash flow or market comparable techniques. The University's interests in certain non-readily marketable alternative investments, such as hedge funds and private equity limited partnerships, are stated at fair value based on NAV estimates used as a practical expedient reported to the University by investment fund managers . The valuation method for investments measured using NAV per share (or its equivalent) is presented in the following table. TABLE 2 -INVESTMENTS MEASURED USING NAV 2017 GLOBAL EQUITY INVESTMENTS ABSOLUTE RETURN STRATEGY FUNDS PRIVATE EQUITY AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS REAL ASSETS FUNDS OTHER TOTAL INVESTMENTS MEASURED USING NAV (Dollars in thousands) Fair Value $ 1,272,046 465,553 339,876 183,070 69,630 $ 2,330,175 Unfunded Redemption Frequency Redemption Commitments (If Currently Eligible) Notice Period $ 22,308 MONTHLY TO ANNUALLY 15-180 DAYS 45,490 QUARTERLY TO ANNUALLY 30-95 DAYS 1. Global Equity: This investment category includes public equity investments in separately managed accounts, long-only comingled funds, unconstrained limited partnerships, and passive market indices. Fair values have been determined using the NAV per share of the investments. For 2017, approximately 75% of the value of the investments in this category can be redeemed within 90 days, and 92% can be redeemed within one year. 2. Absolute Return: This category includes investments in stable income and low-to-medium beta funds. Management of these funds seeks low correlation to broad equity markets by investing in assets that exhibit low volatility, deep discounts, and/or hedges against market downturns . Fair values have been determined using the NAV per share of the investments. Approximately 91 % of the value of the investments in this category can be redeemed within one year. 3. Private equity: This category includes buyout, venture, and special situations funds. Fair values have been determined using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) of the ownership interest in partners' capital. These investments can never be redeemed with the funds, with the exception of one investment. Distributions from each fund will be received as the underlying investments of the funds are liquidated. It is expected that the majority of underlying assets of the funds will be liquidated over the next 7 to 10 years. 4. Real assets: This category includes real estate, natural resources, and other hard assets. Fair values have been determined using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) of the ownership interest in partners' capital. These investments can never be redeemed with the funds. Distributions from each fund will be received as the underlying investments of the funds are liquidated. It is expected that the majority of underlying assets of the funds will be liquidated over the next 7 to 1 0 years. 5. Other: This category consists of fixed income and opportunistic investments and includes various types of non\u00ad investment grade and non-rated credit plus nominal equity exposure. Fair values have been determined using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) of the ownership interest in partners' capital. Approximately 81 % of the value of the investments in this category can be redeemed or anticipate distribution within one year. The remaining balance of these investments contain restrictions on redemption within one year or will be distributed as underlying investments are liquidated . It is expected that the underlying assets of the funds will be liquidated over the next 10 years. INVESTMENT POOLS The University combines most short-term cash balances into the Invested Funds Pool. At June 30, 2017, the Invested Funds Pool totaled $1,658,957,000. The Invested Funds Pool also owns units in the Consolidated Endowment Fund (CEF) valued at $614,540,000 at June 30, 2017. By University policy, departments with qualifying funds in the Invested Funds Pool receive distributions based on their average balances and on the type of balance. Campus depositors received 1 % in fiscal year 2017. University Advancement received 3% of the average balances in endowment operating and gift accounts in fiscal year 2017. The difference between the actual earnings of the Invested Funds Pool and the calculated distributions is used to support activities benefiting all University departments . The majority of the endowed funds are invested in the CEF, a pooled fund. Individual endowments purchase units in the pool on the basis of a per-unit valuation of the CEF at fair value on the last business day of the calendar quarter. Income is distributed based on the number of units held. RCW 24.55 of the Washington State Code and the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act allow for total return expenditure under comprehensive prudent standards. UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 24 B-32Under the CEF spending policy approved by the Board of Regents, quarterly distributions to programs are based on an annual percentage rate of 4.0%, applied to the five-year rolling average of the CE F's market valuation . Additionally, the policy allows for an administrative fee of 1.0% supporting campus-wide fundraising and stewardship activities (0.80%) and offsetting the internal cost of managing endowment assets (0.20%). The University records its permanent endowments at the lower of original gift value or current market value in the Restricted Nonexpendable Net Position category. Of the endowments that are recorded at current market value, the net deficiency from the original gift value is $2,065,000 at June 30, 2017. Funds in irrevocable trusts managed by trustees other than the University are not reported in the financial statements . The fair value of these funds was $112,821,000 at June 30, 2017. Income received from these trusts, which is included in Investment Income, was $4,619,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Net appreciation (depreciation) in the fair value of investments includes both realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments. The University realized net gains of $47,518,000 in fiscal year 2017 from the sale of investments . The calculation of realized gains and losses is independent of the net appreciation of the fair value of investments . Realized gains and losses on investments that have been held in more than one fiscal year and are sold in the current year include the net appreciation (depreciation) of these investments reported in the prior year(s). The net appreciation in the fair value of investments during the year ended June 30, 2017 was $337,086,000. FUNDING COMMITMENTS The University enters into contracts with investment managers to fund alternative investments . As of June 30, 2017, the University had outstanding commitments to fund alternative investments of $385,591,000. These commitments are expected to be called over a multi-year time frame. The University believes it has adequate liquidity and funding sources to meet these obligations. DERIVATIVES The University's investment policies allow investing in various derivative instruments, including futures, swaps and forwards, to manage exposures within or across the portfolio and to improve the portfolio's risk/return profile. Futures are financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase an asset at a predetermined future date and price. Total return swaps involve commitments to pay interest in exchange for a market-linked return, both based on notional amounts. Derivative instruments are recorded on the contract date and are carried at fair value using listed price quotations or amounts that approximate fair value. The notional amount and fair value of investment derivative instruments outstanding at June 30, 2017, categorized by type, are as follows: Credit exposure represents exposure to counterparties relating to financial instruments, where gains exceed collateral held by the University or losses are less than the collateral posted by the University . There was no credit exposure as of June 30, 2017. No derivative instruments have been reclassified from a hedging instrument to an investment instrument. Details on foreign currency derivatives are disclosed under Foreign Exchange Risk.

The University manages interest rate risk through its investment policies and the investment guidelines established with each manager. Each fixed income manager is assigned a maximum boundary for duration as compared to the manager's relevant benchmark index. The goal is to allow ample freedom for the manager to perform, while controlling the interest rate risk in the portfolio. Effective duration is a commonly used measure of interest rate risk. The longer the duration, the more sensitive the portfolio is to changes in interest rates. The weighted average effective duration of the University's fixed income portfolio was 1.95 years at June 30, 2017. FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 / 25 B-33Notes to Financial Statements (continued) CREDIT RISK Fixed income securities are also subject to credit risk, which is the risk that the issuer or other counterparty to a financial instrument will not fulfill its obligations, or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make these payments will cause prices to decline. Concentration of credit risk is the risk of loss attributed to the magnitude of a government's investment in a single issuer. The University Investment Policies limit fixed income exposure to investment grade assets. The Investment Policy for the Invested Funds' cash pool requires each manager to maintain an average quality rating of \"AA\" as issued by a nationally recognized rating organization . The Invested Funds' liquidity pool requires each manager to maintain an average quality rating of \"A\" and to hold 25% of their portfolios in government and government agency issues. The Investment Policy for the CEF reflects its long-term nature by specifying average quality rating levels by individual manager, but still restricting investment to investment grade credits. Duration is a calculation of the number of years required to recover the true cost of a bond. The duration measures presented in Table 4 below represent a broad average across all fixed income securities held in the CEF, the Invested Funds Pool (IF or operating funds) and debt service reserve funds. The CEF and IF portfolios are managed to have a duration below their policy benchmarks to protect principal and provide liquidity to the overall portfolio. Duration and credit risk figures at June 30, 2017 exclude $15,625,000 of fixed income securities held outside the CEF and the IF. These amounts make up 0.80% of the University's fixed income investments, and are not included in the duration figures detailed in Table 4. The composition offixed income securities at June 30, 2017, along with credit quality and effective duration measures, is summarized as follows: TABLE 4-FIXED INCOME: CREDIT QUALITY AND EFFECTIVE DURATION (Dollars in thousands) 2017 Investment Non-Investment Duration Investments U.S. Government Grade* Grade Not Rated Total (in years) U.S. TREASURIES $ 774,034 $ $ $ $ 774,034 1.57 U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY 569,325 569,325 2.30 MORTGAGE $ 49,636 $ 1,931,719 1.95 * Investment Grade securities are those that are rated BBB and higher by Standard and Poor.,s or Baa and higher by Moody's. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK TABLE 5 -INVESTMENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY Foreign exchange risk is the risk that investments denominated in foreign currencies may lose value due to adverse fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. The University's investment policies permit investments in international equity and other asset classes, which can include foreign currency exposure. The University also enters into foreign currency forward contracts, futures contracts, and options to manage the foreign currency exposure . The University held non-U.S. denominated securities at June 30, 2017 of $1,121,780,000.

This land was the original site of the University from 1861 until 1895 when the University moved to its present location on Lake Washington . Since the early 1900s, the University has managed the Metropolitan Tract by leasing to third party tenants, and ground leasing to entities responsible for developing and operating new buildings. The balance as of June 30, 2017 of $146,258,000 represents the asset value net of operating liabilities and long-term debt on the property. The asset value is comprised primarily of land, buildings, building improvements and operating assets. Total debt outstanding on the Metropolitan Tract was $35,000,000 as of June 30, 2017, which will be repaid by proceeds from the properties . The debt was issued in 2015 to refund commercial paper and acquire the leasehold on the Cobb Building. This amount is reflected in the balance for Metropolitan Tract on the Statement of Net Position, and is therefore not included in Note 9 or Note 11. In 2014, the University entered into an agreement with Wright Runstad to undertake activities relating to the redevelopment of the site currently occupied by the Rainier Square (Predevelopment Agreement). The agreement commenced on November 1, 2014 and expires upon the completion of certain development milestones. The Predevelopment Agreement provides for the execution of a ground lease for the development of a multi-use office tower (Tower Lease) and a separate ground lease for a luxury hotel (Rainier Square Hotel Lease). SUBSEQUENT EVENT On September 12, 2017, the University executed the Tower Lease with Wright Runstad and amended the Predevelopment Agreement to allow for a separate future closing of the Rainier Square Hotel Lease. The Tower Lease has an 80 year term, requires Wright Runstad to complete development of the approved building in four years, is unsubordinated, and requires minimum ground rent during construction and 8% of adjusted gross revenue from the project thereafter. Demolition of the existing Rainier Square building is expected in November 2017. In connection with the Tower Lease, the University executed an Operating Agreement with Wright Runstad that regulates how the Rainier Tower and the lessees of the Rainier Square Tower and Hotel will operate shared mix use space on the Rainier Square block.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 / 29 B-37Notes to Financial Statements (continued) ISSUANCE ACTIVITY On November 9, 2016, the University issued $205,160,000 in General Revenue & Refunding Bonds, 2016A&B, at a premium of $35,596,000. Part of the proceeds were used to refund existing debt. The amount of refunded bonds was $38,220,000 ; the amount of refunding bonds was $35,020,000 (plus premium of $4,989,000). The refunded bonds had coupon rates ranging from 4.0% to 5.0% with an average coupon of 4.68%; the new bonds have an average coupon of 4.39%. The refunding decreased the total debt service payments to be made over the next 21 years by $6,154,000 and resulted in a total economic gain of $4,960,000 . The remainder of the proceeds are funding a variety of projects. The average life of the 2016A&B General Revenue Bonds is 17.2 years with final maturity on December 1, 2046. The average coupon of these bonds is 4.80%. REFUNDING ACTIVITY On July 14, 2016, the state of Washington refunded General Obligation Bonds totaling $9,755,000 (UW portion) with new bond issuances totaling $9,130,000 and premium of $1,717,000 . The refunded bonds had an average interest rate and coupon rate of 5.00%; the new bonds have an average coupon rate of 4.90%. The refunding decreased the total debt service payments to be made over the next seven years by $1,057,000 and resulted in a total economic gain of $958,000. COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM The University has a commercial paper program with a maximum borrowing limit of $250,000,000, payable from University general revenues. This short-term borrowing program is primarily used to fund capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2017, there was $67,000,000 in outstanding commercial paper. On July 20, 2016, the University issued of $45,000,000 of commercial paper debt. The proceeds were used to fund various projects such as Phases 3 and 4a of the Housing Master Plan, Animal Research and Care Facilities and UWMC Expansion Phase 2. SUBSEQUENT DEBT ACTIVITY On August 31, 2017, the University issued $45,000,000 of commercial paper debt. The proceeds will be used to fund the Life Sciences Building and Phase 4a of the Housing Master Plan. On September 20, 2017, the University issued $14,000,000 of commercial paper debt. The proceeds will be used to fund construction of the Burke Museum. DEFEASED BONDS The University defeased certain bonds by placing the proceeds of new bonds in an irrevocable trust to provide for all future debt service payments on the old bonds. The trust account assets and the liability for the defeased bonds are not included in the University's financial statements. As of June 30, 2017, $38,693,000 of bonds outstanding are considered defeased.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 / 31 B-39Notes to Financial Statements (continued) NOTE 13: Related Parties Harborview Medical Center (HMC), a hospital and Level I adult and pediatric trauma center located in Seattle, is a component unit of King County, Washington. It has been managed by the University under a management contract between King County and the University since 1967. In February 2016, the University and King County entered into a Hospital Services Agreement . The term of the agreement, including extensions, will expire on December 31, 2045. Under the agreement, the HMC Board of Trustees determines major institutional policies and retains control of programs and fiscal matters, while King County retains ultimate control over capital programs and capital budgets. The University is responsible for the operations of HMC, including the provision of medical, dental and management services. All of the individuals employed at HMC, including physicians, are employees of the University . HMC expenses, including payroll, are reimbursed to the University from HMC fund sources. HMC revenues and expenses are not recognized in the University's financial statements . The University's financial statements do, however, include accounts receivable from HMC of $28,432,000 as of June 30, 2017, as well as HMC investments of $3,629,000, current accrued liabilities of $26,731,000, and long-term liabilities of $30,258,000. Under an annual agreement , HMC provides strategic funding to Neighborhood Clinics. Funding from HMC to Neighborhood Clinics was $11,522,000 during fiscal year 2017, and is presented as Other Operating Revenue in the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position. UW Medicine information technology operates as a self-sustaining activity of the University (ITS department) . The ITS department records enterprise-wide information technology capital assets that are purchased for use by UW Medicine entities. The HMC ITS funding reflected in long-term liabilities (Note 9) of $30,258,000 at June 30, 2017, represents HMC's funding of the enterprise-wide information technology capital assets which will be included in the recharge rates of the ITS department over the useful life of the assets. The University of Washington Foundation (UWF) is a nonprofit organization that performs fundraising activities on behalf of the University. The UWF is not included in the University's financial statements as a component unit because gifts and grants that are made to the UWF are immediately transferred to the University. In 2017, the UWF transferred $114,167,000 to the University in gifts and grants received on its behalf; these are included in the financial statements of the University . The remaining amounts retained by the UWF are not significant to the University's financial statements . The University of Washington Alumni Association is a tax-exempt entity that was established to connect and celebrate alumni and to support the University's mission. The Alumni Association received $3,755,000 from the University in support of its operations in fiscal year 2017. These amounts were expensed by the University . NOTE 14: Other Post Employment Benefits Healthcare and life insurance programs for employees of the state of Washington are administered by the Washington State Health Care Authority (HCA). The HCA calculates the premium amounts each year that are sufficient to fund the statewide health and life insurance programs on a pay-as-you-go basis. These costs are passed through to individual state agencies based upon active employee headcount; the agencies pay the premiums for active employees to the HCA. The agencies may also charge employees for certain higher cost options elected by the employee . State of Washington retirees may elect coverage through state health and life insurance plans, for which they pay less than the full cost of the benefits, based on their age and other demographic factors. The healthcare premiums for active employees, which are paid by the agency during employees' working careers, subsidize the \"underpayments\" of retirees. An additional factor in the OPEB obligation is a payment that is required by the state legislature to reduce the premiums for retirees covered by Medicare (an \"explicit\" subsidy). For calendar year 2017, this amount was $150 per retiree eligible for parts A and B of Medicare . This is also passed through to state agencies through active employee rates charged to the agency. There is no formal state or University plan that underlies the subsidy of retiree health and life insurance. ACTUARIAL STUDY Actuarial studies, performed every two years by the Washington Office of the State Actuary, calculated that the total OPEB obligation of the state of Washington at January 1, 2017 was $5,500,000,000. The annual required contribution was UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 32 B-40$534,000,000 for the state of Washington for 2017. The actuary calculated the OPEB obligation based on individual state employee data, including age, retirement eligibility and length of service. The probability of an employee of a given age and length of service retiring and receiving OPEB benefits is based on statewide historical data. The actuary's allocation of the cumulative statewide liability related to the University and HMC (an unconsolidated related party), was estimated at approximately $1,200,000,000 for 2017. This amount is not included in the University's financial statements. The University paid $349,000,000 for healthcare expenses in fiscal year 2017, which included its pay-as-you-go portion of the OPEB liability, calculated by the actuary at $16,000,000 in 2017. The State Actuary's report is available at osa.leg.wa.gov/Actuarial_Services/OPEB/OPEB .htm. NOTE 15: Pension Plans The University offers four contributory pension plans: 1) the Washington State Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) plan, 2) the Washington State Teachers' Retirement System (TRS) plan, 3) the Law Enforcement Officers' and Fire Fighters' Retirement System (LEOFF) plan, and 4) the University of Washington Retirement Plan (UWRP). PERS, TRS, and LEOFF are cost sharing multiple-employer defined-benefit pension plans administered by the Washington State Department of Retirement Systems (DRS). UWRP is a defined-contribution plan with a supplemental noncontributory defined-benefit plan component, and is administered by the University . As of June 30, 2017, the University's share of the total unfunded liabilities associated with the defined-benefit pension plans administered by the DRS was $983,658,000 . The liability associated with the defined-benefit pension plan administered by the University was $438,753,000, but does not reflect assets physically segregated in a separate investment account to pay future retiree benefits of $230,782,000. For the year ended June 30, 2017, total pension expense recorded by the University related to both the DRS and University plans was $130,620,000. PLANS ADMINISTERED BY DRS PLAN DESCRIPTION Public Employees' Retirement System PERS retirement benefit provisions are contained in chapters 41.34 and 41.40 of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW). PERS is a cost-sharing multiple-employer retirement system comprised of three separate pension plans for membership purposes. PERS Plan 1 and PERS Plan 2 are defined-benefit plans, and PERS Plan 3 is a defined-benefit plan with a defined\u00ad contribution component. PERS members include higher education employees not participating in other higher education retirement programs. For accounting purposes, PERS is reported as three separate plans. Plan 1 accounts for the defined benefits of Plan 1 members, Plan 2/3 accounts for the defined benefits of Plan 2 and Plan 3 members, and Plan 3 accounts for the defined\u00ad contribution portion of Plan 3 members . The defined-benefit portions of Plan 2 and Plan 3 are accounted for in the same pension trust fund, and all assets of Plan 2/3 may legally be used to pay the defined benefits of any of the Plan 2 or Plan 3 members or beneficiaries. Teachers' Retirement System TRS retirement benefit provisions are contained in chapters 41.32 and 41.34 of the RCW. TRS is a cost-sharing, multiple\u00ad employer retirement system, comprised of three separate pension plans for membership purposes ; TRS Plan 1 and TRS Plan 2 are defined-benefit plans and TRS Plan 3 is a defined-benefit plan with a defined-contribution component. TRS eligibility for membership requires service as a certificated public school employee working in an instructional, administrative or supervisory capacity. For accounting purposes, similar to PERS, TRS is reported as three separate plans. Plan 1 accounts for the defined benefits of Plan 1 members, Plan 2/3 accounts for the defined benefits of Plan 2 and Plan 3 members, and Plan 3 accounts for the defined-contribution portion of Plan 3 members . The defined-benefit portions of Plan 2 and Plan 3 are accounted for in the same pension trust fund, and all assets of Plan 2/3 may legally be used to pay the defined benefits of any of the Plan 2 or Plan 3 members or beneficiaries. Law Enforcement Officers' and Fire Fighters' Retirement System LEOFF retirement benefit provisions are contained in chapter 41.26 of the RCW. LEO FF is a cost-sharing multiple-employer retirement system comprised of two separate pension plans for both membership and accounting purposes. The University participates in LEOFF Plan 2, which is a defined-benefit plan. LEOFF membership includes full-time, fully compensated, local law enforcement commissioned officers, firefighters, and as of July 24, 2005, emergency medical technicians . FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 / 33 B-41Notes to Financial Statements (continued) VESTING AND BENEFITS PROVIDED PERS Plan 1 and TRS Plan 1 PERS Plan 1 and TRS Plan 1 provide retirement, disability and death benefits. Both plans are closed to new entrants. All members were vested after the completion of five years of eligible service. Retirement benefits are determined as two percent of the member's average final compensation (AFC) times the member's years of service. The AFC is the average of the member's 24 highest-paid consecutive service months. The retirement benefit may not exceed 60% of the AFC. Members are eligible for retirement from active status at any age with at least 30 years of service, at age 55 with at least 25 years of service, or at age 60 with at least five years of service. Members retiring from inactive status prior to the age of 65 may receive actuarially reduced benefits. Other benefits include duty and nonduty disability payments, an optional cost-of-living allowance, and a one-time duty-related death benefit, if the member is found eligible by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries . PERS Plan 2/3 and TRS Plan 2/3 PERS Plan 2/3 and TRS Plan 2/3 provide retirement, disability and death benefits. PERS Plan 2 and TRS Plan 2 members are vested after completion of five years of eligible service. PERS Plan 3 and TRS Plan 3 members are vested in the defined-benefit portion of their plan after 1 O years of service, or after five years of service if 12 months are earned after age 44. Retirement benefits are determined as 2% of the member's AFC times the member's years of service for Plan 2, and 1 % of AFC times the member's years of service for Plan 3. The AFC is the average of the member's 60 highest-paid consecutive service months. There is no cap on years of service credit. Members are eligible for retirement with a full benefit at age 65 with at least five years of service credit. Retirement before age 65 is considered early retirement. Members are eligible for early retirement with a reduced benefit at age 55 with at least 20 years of service credit. The benefit is reduced by a factor that varies according to age, for each year before age 65. Retirement benefits are actuarially reduced to reflect the choice of a survivor benefit. Other benefits include duty and non\u00ad duty disability payments, a cost-of-living allowance (based on the Consumer Price Index) capped at three percent annually, and a one-time duty-related death benefit, if the member is found eligible by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries. LEOFF Plan 2 LEOFF Plan 2 provides retirement, disability and death benefits. Members are vested after completing five years of eligible service. Retirement benefits are determined as 2% of the final average salary (FAS) per year of service, based on the member's 60 highest-paid consecutive service months. Members are eligible for retirement with a full benefit at age 53 with at least five years of service credit. Members who retire prior to age 53 receive reduced benefits. Other benefits include duty and non-duty disability payments, a cost-of-living allowance (based on the Consumer Price Index) capped at 3% annually, and a one-time duty-related death benefit if the member is found eligible by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries. FIDUCIARY NET POSITION The pension plans' fiduciary net positions have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by the pension plans. DRS financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The retirement plans are accounted for in pension trust funds using the flow of economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Member contributions are recognized as revenues in the period in which the contributions are earned. Employer contributions are recognized when due, and the employer has made a formal commitment to provide the contributions. Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable, in accordance with the terms of each plan. The RCW (chapter 43.33 A) authorizes the Washington State Investment Board (WSIB) to have the investment management responsibility for the pension funds. Investments are reported at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are included as investment income in the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position presented in the DRS Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. Purchases and sales of investments are recorded on a trade-date basis. DRS publishes an annual report for retirement plans, which is available at drs.wa.gov/administration/ annualreport/. ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS Accounting requirements dictate the use of assumptions to best estimate the impact that pension obligations will have on the University . The professional judgments used in determining these assumptions are important, and can significantly impact the resulting actuarial estimates. Differences between actual results compared to these assumptions could have a significant effect on the University's financial statements . UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 34 B-42The total pension liability for each DRS plan was determined by an actuarial valuation, conducted by the Washington State Office of the State Actuary (OSA). The University's 2017 pension liability is based on an OSA valuation performed as of June 30, 2015, with the results rolled forward to the measurement date of June 30, 2016. The following actuarial assumptions have been applied to all prior periods included in the measurement: INFLATION SALARY INCREASE INVESTMENT RATE OF RETURN 3.0% TOTAL ECONOMIC INFLATION, 3.75% SALARY INFLATION EXPECTED TO GROW BY PROMOTIONS AND LONGEVITY IN ADDITION TO SALARY INFLATION ASSUMPTION 7.50% Mortality rates were based on the RP-2000 Combined Healthy Table and Combined Disabled Table published by the Society of Actuaries' Retirement Plans Experience Committee (RPEC). As recommended by the RPEC, the OSA applied offsets to the base table and recognized future improvements in mortality by projecting the mortality rates using 100% Scale BB. Mortality rates are applied on a generational basis, meaning members are assumed to receive additional mortality improvements in each future year, throughout their lifetimes. The actuarial assumptions used in the June 30, 2015, valuation were based on the results of the 2007-2012 Experience Study Report. Additional assumptions for subsequent events and law changes are current as of the 2015 actuarial valuation report. The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined by the WSIB using a building block method in which a best estimate of expected future rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense, but including inflation) are developed for each major asset class. Those expected returns make up one component of WSIB's Capital Market Assumptions (CMAs). WSIB uses the CMAs and their target asset allocation to simulate future investment returns over various time horizons. The long-term expected rate of return of 7.50% approximately equals the median of the simulated investment returns over a SO-year time horizon, adjusted to remove or damper any short-term changes that are not expected over the entire SO-year measurement period. Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the target asset allocation for each pension plan, as of the measurement date of June 30, 2016, are summarized in the following table: Asset Class FIXED INCOME TANGIBLE ASSETS REAL ESTATE GLOBAL EQUITY PRIVATE EQUITY 2017 (Measurement Date 2016) Long-Term Target Allocation Expected Arithmetic Real used to create the above table is 2.20%, and represents WSIB's most recent long-term estimate of broad economic inflation. DISCOUNT RATE The discount rate used to measure the total pension liabilities as of June 30, 2017 was 7.50%. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that contributions from plan members will be made at contractually required rates, and that contributions from employers will be made at statutorily required rates, actuarially determined (including the component of PERS 2/3 and TRS 2/3 employer rates pertaining to the unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities for PERS 1 and TRS 1, respectively). Based on those assumptions, the fiduciary net position for each pension plan was projected to be sufficient to make all projected future benefit payments of the current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. Using the WSIB long-term expected rate of return, a 7.50% future investment rate of return on pension plan investments was assumed. The expected return on plan assets is the estimated long-term rate of return that will be earned on the investments used to fund the pension obligation. Contributions from plan members and employers were assumed to continue to be made at contractually required rates (including the component of PERS 2/3 and TRS 2/3 employer rates pertaining to the unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities for PERS 1 and TRS 1, respectively, as provided for in chapter 41 .45 of the RCW). FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 / 35 B-43Notes to Financial Statements (continued) SENSITIVITY OF THE NET PENSION LIABILITY (ASSET) TO CHANGES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE The following table presents the University's net pension liability calculated using the discount rate of 7.50% as well as what the net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is one-percentage-point lower (6.50%) or one-percentage-point higher (8.50%) than the current rate.

The measurement date for the net pension liabilities recorded by the University as of June 30, 2017 was June 30, 2016. Employer contributions received and processed by the DRS during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 have been used as the basis for determining each employer's proportionate share of the collective pension amounts reported by the DRS in their June 30, 2016 Schedules of Employer and Nonemployer Allocations .

Faculty, librarians and professional staff are eligible to participate in the UWRP. Contributions to the plan are invested by participants in annuity contracts or mutual fund accounts offered by one or more fund sponsors. Employees have at all times a 100% vested interest in their accumulations. Benefits from the plan are available upon separation or retirement at the member's option. RCW 28B.10.400 et. seq. assigns the authority to the University of Washington Board of Regents to establish and amend benefit provisions. The number of participants in the UWRP as of June 30, 2017 was 16,161. FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 / 37 B-45Notes to Financial Statements (continued) Funding Policy Employee contribution rates, based on age, are 5%, 7.5% or 10% of salary. The University matches 100% of employee contributions. Within parameters established by the legislature, contribution requirements may be established or amended by the University of Washington Board of Regents. Employer contributions for the year ended June 30, 2017 were $112,420,000. University of Washington Supplemental Retirement Plan PLAN DESCRIPTION UWSRP, a single-employer 401 (a) defined-benefit retirement plan administered by the University, operates in tandem with the 403(b) plan to supplement the expected defined-contribution retirement savings accumulated under the UWRP. The UWSRP was closed to new participants effective March 1, 2011. UWSRP membership includes academic, librarian, professional and other salary positions employed in eligible positions. ACTIVE EMPLOYEES INACTIVE EMPLOYEES RECEIVING BENEFITS INACTIVE EMPLOYEES ENTITLED TO, BUT NOT RECEIVING, BENEFITS As of June 30, 2017 7,046 696 4 VESTING AND BENEFITS PROVIDED UWSRP retirement benefit provisions are contained in RCW 28B.10.400, et. seq. which assigns the authority to establish and amend benefit provisions to the University of Washington Board of Regents. Members are eligible for calculation of a possible retirement benefit under this plan when they have reached age 62 and have 1 O years of service with the University . Upon retirement, a calculation is performed which compares \"goal income\" to \"assumed income\" to determine if benefits have been earned under the plan. Goal income is the product of a service factor multiplied by average monthly compensation, and then by eligible years of participation. Average monthly compensation is defined as the average annual basic salary, not to exceed annual limits established by the Internal Revenue Code, paid to a participant for their highest 24 consecutive months of service. Assumed income must be calculated by an independent actuary, and represents a theoretical amount of monthly income that would have been generated if actual employee and University contributions to the UWRP had been allocated equally between fixed and variable dollar annuities. When the goal income exceeds the assumed income, the participant is entitled to benefits under this plan. Benefit payments made during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017 were $5,136,000. TOTAL PENSION LIABILITY (TPL) Assets set aside to pay UWSRP benefits are not held in a qualified trust as defined by GASB. A qualified trust requires that contributions from employers be irrevocable, dedicated to providing pension benefits to plan members, and are legally protected from creditors of the employer and plan administrator. As a result, the University reports the total UWSRP pension liability. This is different from the DRS plans (PERS, TRS, and LEOFF2), which have trusted assets and, therefore, are reported as a net pension liability. The University has set aside $230,782,000 to pay future UWSRP retiree benefits. These assets are physically segregated in a separate investment account, and included in Investments, Net of Current Portion on the Statement of Net Position.

Update procedures performed by the Office of the State Actuary were used to roll forward the TPL to the measurement date of June 30, 2017. UWSRP pension expense for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017 was $22,054,000. ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS Accounting requirements dictate the use of assumptions to best estimate the impact that pension obligations will have on the University . The professional judgments used in determining these assumptions are important, and can significantly impact the resulting actuarial estimates . Differences between actual results compared to these assumptions could have a significant effect on the University's financial statements. 2017 INFLATION SALARY CHANGES SOURCE OF MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS DATE OF EXPERIENCE STUDY DISCOUNT RATE SOURCE OF DISCOUNT RATE TPL MEASUREMENT AT DISCOUNT RATE TPL DISCOUNT RATE INCREASED 1 % TPL DISCOUNT RATE DECREASED 1 % 2.75% 4.25% (Dollars in thousands) RP-2000 COMBINED HEALTHY TABLE, WITH GENERATIONAL MORTALITY IMPROVEMENTS USING SCALE BB APRIL 2016 3.58% BOND BUYER'S 20 BOND INDEX AS OF 6/30/2017 $ 438,753 $ 382,026 $ 507,452 Material assumption changes during the measurement period include updating the GASB Statement No. 73 discount rate from 2.85% to 3.58% (decreased the TPL), and updating the variable income investment return assumption used in the \"assumed income\" calculation from 6.75% to 6.25% (increased the TPL).

These expenditures will be funded from institutional reserves, debt proceeds and state appropriations. The University receives and expends substantial amounts under federal and state grants, contracts and programs. This funding is used for research, student aid, Medical Center operations and other programs, and is subject to audit by governmental granting agencies. Certain grant and contract costs billed to the federal government are subject to audit under 2 CFR 200, \"Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards.\" The University is also involved in various other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. University management believes that any liabilities arising from these matters will not have a material effect on the University's financial statements . The University is exposed to risk of loss related to tort liability, injuries to employees and loss of property. The University purchases insurance protection for workers' compensation as well as marine, aviation and certain other risks. The University also purchases insurance protection for loss of property at self-sustaining units, bond-financed buildings and where otherwise required by contract; otherwise, the risk of property loss is retained, unfunded. For medical professional, general, employment practices, automobile liability, and information security and privacy protection, the University maintains a program of self-insurance reserves and excess insurance coverage. The self-insurance reserve represents the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims resulting from events that have occurred on or before the Statements of Net Position date. The reserve includes the undiscounted amounts that will be required for future payments of claims that have been reported, and claims related to events that have occurred but have not yet been reported. The self-insurance reserve is estimated through an actuarial calculation and included in Long-Term Liabilities. Changes in the self-insurance reserve for the year ended June 30, 2017 are noted below: (Dollars in thousands) RESERVE AT BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR INCURRED CLAIMS AND CHANGES IN ESTIMATES CLAIM

results of an actuarial valuation consistent with the state's funding policy defined in chapter 41 .45 RCW. Consistent with the state's contribution-rate adoption process, the results of an actuarial valuation with an odd-numbered year valuation date determine the ADC for the biennium that ensues two years later. For example, the actuarial valuation with a June 30, 2015, valuation date, completed in the fall of 2016, determines the ADC for the period beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2019. Adopted contribution rates could be different pending the actions of the governing bodies. For instance, for the period beginning July 1, 2015, and ending June 30, 2017, the contribution rates the Pension Funding Council adopted, which the Legislature did not change, reflect a phasing in of the increase to contribution rates that resulted from a change to the mortality assumption. The increase is expected to be phased in over three biennia for PERS Plans 1, 2 and 3 and TRS Plans 1, 2 and 3. For cost-sharing plans, OSA calculates the contractually required contributions (CRC) using the same assumptions and methods as the ADC except the CRC reflect the adopted contribution rates for the time period shown, which might differ from the contribution rates produced for the ADC. Plans administered by the University The University of Washington Supplemental Retirement Plan has no assets accumulated in a trust to pay retiree benefits that meets the criteria in GASB statement No. 73, paragraph 4. Material assumption changes during the measurement period include updating the GASB statement No. 73 discount rate from 2.85% to 3.58%, and updating the variable income investment return assumption used in the \"assumed income\" calculation from 6.75% to 6.25%. UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 44 2015 $ 303 $ 300 $ 3 $ 3,534 8.57% B-52B-53B-54 C-1 APPENDIX C FORM OF BOND COUNSEL OPINION February 15, 2018 University of Washington Seattle, Washington JP Morgan Securities New York, New York Re: University of Washington, General Revenue Bonds, 2018 - $13 3,785,000 Ladies and Gentlemen: We have examined a certified transcript of all of the proceedi ngs taken in the matter of the issuance by the University of Washington (the \"University\") of its General Reve nue Bonds, 2018, in the aggregate principal amount of $133,785,000 (the \"Bonds\"). The Bonds are issued pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Regents of the University adopted on July 13, 2017 (the \"Resolution\"). Capital ized terms used in this opinion which are not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to such terms i n the Resolution. The Bonds are subject to redemption prior to their scheduled m aturities as set forth in the Official Statement dated January 23, 2018. The University has not design ated the Bonds as \"qualified tax-exempt obligations\" within the meaning of Section 265(b)(3) of the Int ernal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Tax Code\"). Regarding questions of fact material to our opinion, we have r elied on representations of the University in the Resolution and in the certifi ed proceedings and on other ce rtifications of public officials and others furnished to us without undertaking to verify the same by independent invest igation. Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, under exis ting law: 1. The Bonds have been legally issued and constitute valid and binding obligations of the University, except to the extent that the enforcement of the rights and rem edies of the owners of the Bonds may be limited by laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar la ws of general application affecting the rights of creditors. 2. The Bonds are special fund obligations of the University. Bo th principal of and interest on the Bonds are payable solely from General Revenues and the money an d investments deposited to a special fund of the University known as the General Revenue Bond Redemption Fund, 2 018 created pursuant to the Resolution (the \"Bond Fund\"). The University has obligated and bound itsel f to set aside and pay into the Bond Fund out of General Revenues amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds as the same become due. The Bonds are equally and ratably pa yable, without preference, priority or distinction because of date of issue or otherwise from General Revenues. The University has reserved th e right to issue Additional Bonds payable from General Revenues and has previously issued General Revenue obli gations. 3. Interest on the Bonds is excludable from gross income for f ederal income tax purposes and is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternati ve minimum tax imposed on individuals. The opinion set forth in the preceding sentence is subject to the condition that the University comply with all requirements of the Tax Code, that must be satisfied subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds in order that the interest thereon be, and continue to be, excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The University has covenanted to comply with all applicable requirements. Failure to comply with certain of such covenants may cause interest on the C-2 Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax pur poses retroactively to the date of issuance of the Bonds. Except as expressly stated above, we express no opinion regard ing any tax consequences related to the ownership, sale or disposition of the Bonds, or the amount, acc rual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds. Owners of the Bonds should consult their tax advisors regarding the appli cability of any collateral tax consequences of owning the Bonds. We have not been engaged nor have we undertaken to review the a ccuracy, completeness or sufficiency of the official statement or other offering material related to th e Bonds (except to the extent, i f any, stated in the official statement), and we express no opinion relating thereto, or rela ting to the undertaking by the University to provide ongoing disclosure pursuant to S ecurities and Exchange Commissi on Rule 15c2-12. This opinion is given as of the date hereof, and we assume no o bligation to update, revise or supplement this opinion to reflect any facts or circumstances that may her eafter come to our attention or any changes in law that may hereafter occur. Very truly yours, P ACIFICA LAW GROUP LLP D-1 APPENDIX D BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM The following information has been provided by DTC. The University makes no representation regarding the accuracy or completeness thereof. Bene ficial Owners should therefore confirm the following with DTC or the Direct Participants (as hereinafter defined). Language in [brackets] with strike-through has been deleted as permitted by DTC as it does not pertain to the Bonds. 1. The Depository Trust Company (\"DTC\"), New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the securities (the \"Securities\"). The Securities will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC's partnership nominee) or such other name as ma y be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Sec urity certificate will be issue d for [each issue of] the Securities, [each] in the aggregate principal amount of such issue, and will be deposited with DTC. [If, however, the aggregate principal amount of [any] issue exceeds $500 million, one certificate wil l be issued with respect to each $500 million of principal amount, and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of such issue.] 2. DTC, the world's largest securities depository, is a limited -purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a \"ban king organization\" within the m eaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a \"clearing corporation\" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a \"clearing agency\" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing fo r over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC's participants (\"Direct Participants\") deposit with DTC. DT C also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants' a ccounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and cer tain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Tru st & Clearing Corporation (\"DTCC\"). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clear ing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as bot h U.S. and non-U.S. securities b rokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodia l relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (\"Indirect Particip ants\"). DTC has Standard & Poo r's rating of AA+. The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with t he Securities and Exchange Commi ssion. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com. 3. Purchases of Securities under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Securities on DTC's records . The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Security (\"Beneficial Owner\") is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants' records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DT C of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing de tails of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, fr om the Direct or Indirect Parti cipant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the Securi ties are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Par ticipants acting on behalf of B eneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in Securiti es, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Securities is discontinued. 4. To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Securities deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC's partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Securities wit h DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in benef icial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Securities; DTC's records refle ct only the identity of the Direct Participants to D-2 whose accounts such Securities are credited, which may or may n ot be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping accou nt of their holdings on be half of their customers. 5. Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Dir ect Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Partic ipants, and by Direct Participan ts and Indirect Participants t o Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among th em, subject to any statutory o r regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. [Beneficial Owners of Securities may wish to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the Securities, s uch as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Security documents. For example, Beneficial O wners of Securities may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Securities for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners. In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their na mes and addresses to the Registrar and request that copies of notices be provided directly to them.] [6. Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all o f the Securities within an issue are being redeemed, DTC's practi ce is to determine by lot the amount of t he interest of each Direct Participant in such issue to be redeemed.] 7. Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to Securities unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accorda nce with DTC's MMI Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to Issuer as soon as pos sible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.'s consenting or voting rights to those Direc t Participants to whose accounts Securities are credited on the record date (id entified in a listing attached t o the Omnibus Proxy). 8. Redemption proceeds, distribu tions, and dividend payments on the Securities will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authoriz ed representative of DTC. DTC's practice is to credit Direct Participants' acco unts upon DTC's receipt of fund s and corresponding detail information from Issuer or Agent, on payable date in acc ordance with their respective h oldings shown on DTC's records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the acco unts of customers in bearer fo rm or registered in \"street name,\" and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, Agent, or Issuer, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be request ed by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of Issuer or Agent, disbursement of such payment s to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants. [9. A Beneficial Owner shall give notice to elect to have its S ecurities purchased or tendered, through its Participant, to [Tender/Remarketing] Agent, and shall effect de livery of such Securities by causing the Direct Participant to transfer the Participant's interest in the Securities, on DTC's records, to [Tender/Remarketing] Agent. The requirement for physical delivery of Securities in connecti on with an optional tender or a mandatory purchase will be deemed satisfied when the ownership rights in the Securities are transferred by Dir ect Participants on DTC's records and followed by a book-entry credit of tendered Securit ies to [Tender/Remarketi ng] Agent's DTC account.] 10. DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository wi th respect to the Securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to Issuer or Agent. Under such circ umstances, in the event that a successor depository is not obtained, Security certificat es are required to be printed and delivered. 11. Issuer may decide to discontinue use of the system of book- entry-only transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository) . In that event, Security certi ficates will be printed and delivered to DTC. 12. The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC's bo ok-entry system has been obtained from sources that Issuer believes to be reliable, but Issuer ta kes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.
