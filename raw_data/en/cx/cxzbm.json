Sir: I have the honor to present to you the annual report of the condition and operations of this department of the public service. The navy, at the present time, consists of the following number and description of vessels: One ship of 120 guns; nine ships of the line, of 90 guns each; one razee, of 62 guns; twelve 52-gun frigates; two 48 gun frigates; eleven first-class sloops of war, 24 16-gun sloops; two sloops for guns' each. There are also four first-class sloops on the stocks, nearly ready for launching; eleven 10 gun brigs and schooners; three ditto used as store ships, and one for a receiving vessel at Charleston; the steamship Mississippi, of 12 guns; the Fulton, of 8 guns; the Princeton, (Ericsson's propeller,) of 12 guns; the Union, of 4 guns, (with Lieut.

There are likewise four small schooners employed as packets, or receiving-vessels. In all, seventy-six vessels, of the various descriptions. The Washington, 90-gun ship, has been broken up the last year; and the frigate Hudson is unfit to repair. The sloop Concord, 24 guns, was lost in the Mozambique channel, on the eastern coast of Africa, on the 2d of October, 1842. The commander, William Boerum, the purser, B. F. Hart, and James Davis, an ordinary seaman, were drowned, while crossing the bar at the mouth of Lorango river, in the captain's gig. The surviving officers and crew were conveyed, in a vessel chartered for the purpose, to Rio Janeiro, and thence to the United States. I regret to report that the schooner Grampus has not been heard from since the 14th of March last\u2014when she was off Charleston, S. C\u2014and is supposed to have been lost, with all hands, in some of the severe gales which occurred about that time. I have also, the unpleasant duty of reporting the loss of the steamship Missouri. This frigate departed early in August, for the purpose of conveying the Commissioner for China (the honorable Caleb Gushing) to Alexandria, in Egypt, en route to the court of Pekin. While she was lying in the harbor of Gibraltar, (into which port she had put for the purpose of replenishing her fuel,), she took fire on the evening of the 26th of August, and the utmost exertions of her officers and men, during the trying and perilous event, were unavailing in extinguishing the flames; --482-- and this costly ship\u2014an ornament to the navy\u2014was entirely destroyed. The larger part of her officers and men have reached the United States in a ship chartered to bring them home. Her commander (Captain Newton) remains, with a portion of her force, to secure what can be recovered from the wreck. All the accounts of this disaster concur in representing the officers and crew as having made the utmost exertions to extinguish the flames; and that their conduct during this perilous period, when an explosion of the magazine was momentarily expected, was marked by great coolness and intrepidity. Captain Newton's official report (a copy of which is hereto appended) having been laid before yon, further investigations into the causes of this loss are postponed until after his return. The ship Franklin, requiring heavy repairs, has been laid up at the Charlestown yard, awaiting a more favorable season for prosecuting such work. The razee Independence has been ordered to the same yard for a like purpose. The Constitution frigate, at Norfolk, and the sloop-of-war Yorktown, at New York, are undergoing repairs, preparatory to sea service. The brig Dolphin, at Norfolk, is awaiting repairs. Inquiries were instituted, early in the summer, as to the cost of building an iron steamer of about 1,000 tons, at Pittsburg, with Hunter's submerged wheels; and, in the execution of this plan, a contract was entered into, early in October, with Messrs. Tomlinson & Co., for building it, at a definite price per pound; and the whole cost not to exceed, in any event, $150,000, with a guaranty of speed at the rate of nine miles per hour, from her steam power, in smooth water. Some months since, an order was given to build a small iron steamer at the Washington navy-yard, on Hunter's plan, to be partly of galvanized iron; but, owing to the heavy drafts upon the appropriation, for other purposes, that work is now suspended. Instructions were also given, in April last, for the building of six sloops-of-war of the largest class; two of which have been launched, and the others are on the stocks, nearly ready for launching. The work on two of these has been suspended for the present. In addition to these sloops on the stocks, there are, of the vessels previously named as constituting a part of the naval force, the following on the stocks, viz: the Vermont and Virginia, 90 guns each, at Boston; the Alabama, 90 guns, at Portsmouth, New Hampshire; the New York, 90 guns, at Norfolk; the Santee frigate, 52 guns, at Portsmouth, New Hampshire; and the frigate Sabine, 52 guns, at New York. The vessels afloat have been employed, during the past year, as follows: In the home squadron, the razee Independence, commanded by Captain Stringham until May, and since that time by Captain McKeever; the sloop Falmouth, commanded by Commander J. McIntosh up to August, when he was relieved by Commander J. R. Sands; the sloop Vincennes, commanded by Commander F. Buchanan; the sloop Vandalia, commanded by Commander W. J. McCluney, who was relieved, in consequence of ill health, in September, and succeeded by Commander J. S. Chauncey; the brig Dolphin, commanded by Commander J. D. Knight, who was relieved, in October, by Commander H. Bruce; the brig Somers, commanded by Lieutenant J. W. West; the brig Boxer, commanded by Lieutenant O. Bullus; the brig Bainbridge, commanded by Lieutenant Z. F. Johnston, who was relieved in September, and succeeded by Commander J. Mattison; and the schooner Grampus, Lieutenant A. E. Downes; --483-- the whole under the command of Commodore Charles Stewart. The cruising ground of this squadron extends from the Banks of Newfoundland to the river Amazon, and includes the Gulf of Mexico and. the Caribbean sea. In the Mediterranean squadron, conformably with previous arrangements, an exchange of commands has taken place between Commodores Morris and Morgan. Commodore Morris sailed from the coast of Brazil in the Delaware, 74, Captain Charles S. McCauley, on the 19th of February, and arrived in the Mediterranean on the 9th of April, when the command of the Mediterranean squadron was transferred to him by Commodore Morgan; and the latter sailed in June, with the Columbus, 74, Captain Benjamin Cooper, for the coast of Brazil. The frigate Congress, Captain P. F. Voorhees, has been employed in the Mediterranean during the whole year, and is expected to sail in January next for Brazil, to interchange with the frigate Columbia, Captain B. R. Shubrick, now on that station. The sloop Fairfield, commanded by Commander A. Bigelow during a part of the year, and subsequently by Commander S. W. Downing, has also been attached to the Mediterranean squadron. This vessel will return to the United States upon the arrival out of the new sloop-of-war Plymouth, now about to sail, under the command of Commander H. Henry. The sloop Preble, Commander S. B. Wilson, having finished her cruise in the Mediterranean, arrived at Boston the 31st August, and is ready again for sea. The sloop Lexington has been employed as a store-ship for this squadron. She has made one voyage with provisions and stores, and is now on her second trip. The term of Commodore Morris's command having expired, Commodore Joseph Smith has been selected to succeed him, and has sailed for the Mediterranean in the new frigate Cumberland, Captain S. L. Breese; which vessel will be the flag-ship of the squadron. Upon the arrival out of the Cumberland, Commodore Morris will return to the United States in the Delaware, 74. The cruising ground of this squadron embraces the Mediterranean sea. In the Brazil squadron, in addition to the Delaware, 74, there have been employed the frigate Columbia, Captain Edward R. Shubrick; the sloop John Adams, Commander Conover; the sloop Decatur, Commander Farragut, (which vessel returned to the United States on the 18th of February;) and the schooner Enterprise, now in command of Lieutenant J. M. Watson. Commodore Morgan arrived at Rio de Janeiro, in the Columbus, 74, on the 2d of August, where he was met by Commodore Daniel Turner, who had been appointed to succeed him in the command of the squadron. This latter vessel is now the flag-ship of Commodore Turner, but she will return to the United States on the arrival out of the frigate Raritan, now preparing for sea, under the command of Captain F. H. Gregory. The sloop Boston, Commander Pendergrast, has sailed from Boston to relieve the John Adams. The brig Pioneer, lately used as a receiving vessel at Baltimore, is now fitting out at Norfolk as a store-ship for this squadron. Lieutenant Shaw has been ordered to command her. The cruising ground of this squadron extends from the mouth of the river Amazon to Cape Horn; along the equator, eastward, to the south- --484-- western boundary of the African station, Cape Negro; thence, along the coast of Africa, to the Cape of Good Hope. The Pacific squadron, at the commencement of the year, consisted of the frigate United States, Captain James Armstrong; the sloop Cyane, Commander Stribling; the sloop Dale, Commander Dornin; the schooner Shark, Lieutenant Eagle; and the store-ship Relief, Lieutenant Sterett: the whole under the command of Commodore Thomas Ap C. Jones. On the 24th of January, Commodore Jones was recalled, and Commodore A. J. Dallas ordered to succeed him in the command of the squadron. Commodore Dallas sailed from Norfolk in the sloop Vandalia for Chagres, and arrived at Callao in the latter part of July. On the 8th of August, he had not met with Commodore Jones, who was absent on a cruise to the Sandwich Islands. The Yorktown returned home on the 2d of August, and the Dale on the 19th of October, having on board the remains of Commodore A. Claxton, who died while in command of the squadron. The places of these vessels have been supplied by the sloop Levant, Commander H. N. Page, which sailed from Norfolk on the 2d of September; and the Warren, Commander J. B. Hull, on the 19th of October. The new frigate Savannah has been equipped for sea, and sailed on the 19th of October, from New York, under the command of Captain A. Fitzhugh, to join this squadron. When she reaches the Pacific, the United States will probably return home. The store-ship Erie, Lieutenant Manning, sailed from Boston on the 9th of February, with provisions and stores for this squadron. Upon her arrival at Rio, Lieutenant Manning was relieved from the command, and Lieutenant N. W. Duke ordered to succeed him. The Erie has arrived on the station. The vessels of this squadron have been ordered to return to the United States, in future, by way of China and the Cape of Good Hope. This squadron cruises along the whole west coast of America, and westward from the meridian of Cape Horn to one hundred and eighty degrees west longitude, and southward between those meridians. The East India squadron has been composed of the frigate Constellation, Commodore Kearney commanding the squadron, and the sloop Boston, Commander J. C. Long; which latter vessel, after visiting the most important ports and islands in the China seas and the Pacific, returned home by Cape Horn in the month of August. The Constellation left China in the early part of the year, and was at the Sandwich Islands in August last, to sail in a few days for the United States, via California' and Cape Horn. A squadron, under the command of Commodore Foxhall A. Parker, has been fitted out in the place of that commanded by Commodore Kearney. The frigate Brandywine, bearing the flag of Commodore Parker, and the sloop St. Louis, Commander H. H. Cocke, sailed from Norfolk on the 23d of May. These vessels arrived at Rio de Janeiro on the 19th of July, and sailed thence on the 5th of August. A leak was discovered in the bow of the St. Louis, which obliged her to put back to Rio for repairs, at which place she arrived on the 7th of September. It was expected that the vessel would sail again in a few days. The new brig Perry, which was launched in May, has been despatched, under the command of Commander S. F. Dupont, to join this squadron. The African squadron is composed of the frigate Macedonian, Captain --485-- Mayo; the sloop Saratoga, and the brig Porpoise, Lieutenant Stellwagen: the whole under the command of Commodore Matthew C. Perry. The brig Consort is now fitting out at Boston as a store-ship for this squadron. The cruising-ground of the squadron extends from Madeira and the Canary Islands, to the Bight of Biafra; and from the coast of Africa to the thirtieth degree of west longitude. The following vessels have been employed on special or detached service: The brig Truxton, Lieutenant Upshur, sailed from Norfolk in June last for Constantinople, to bring home the remains of the late Commodore David Porter. She is daily expected to arrive in the United States. The brig Oregon, Lieutenant (now Commander) Powell, which had been employed on a survey of the Gulf of Mexico, between Apalachicola bay and the Mississippi river, under a resolution of Congress dated the 20th July, 1840, arrived at Norfolk the 27th July last\u2014the season being too far advanced to permit a further continuance of operations. The steamer Poinsett, also engaged on this survey, remained out; and the work has been resumed under Lieutenant R. Semmes. The schooner Flirt, Lieutenant J. A. Davis, made a trip to Chagres in April, with a mail for the Pacific squadron; returned to Norfolk in July, and has since been despatched to Galveston, Texas. The schooner Phoenix, Lieutenant Sinclair, has also been employed as a despatch vessel, and has recently returned from Chagres. The brig Lawrence, built at Baltimore by contract, has been fitted out, and placed under the command of Commander W. H. Gardner, and has just departed from Norfolk, on a cruise to the Windward islands. The sloop Marion, Commander W. M. Armstrong, returned from a cruise in the West Indies in May last, and is now ready for sea at Boston. The small steamer Engineer has had a new boiler put in her, and is now used as a tender to the receiving-ship at Norfolk. The vessels employed as receiving-ships are the Pennsylvania, Captain Zantzinger, at Norfolk; the Ohio, Captain Hunter, at Boston; the North Carolina, Captain Dulany, at New York; the Experiment, Commander Varnum, at Philadelphia; and the On-ka-hy-e, Commander Knight, at Charleston, South Carolina. The Ontario, lately used as a receiving- ship at New Orleans, and the Wave, at Baltimore, have been laid up, for the present, at Norfolk. Two war-steamers, with submerged propellers, have been launched during the year\u2014the Union and the Princeton. The Union is constructed upon the plan of Lieutenant Hunter\u2014with submerged horizontal wheels upon the sides. The trial of this vessel was considered quite satisfactory to the department. The boilers, however, having been somewhat faulty, new ones are to be substituted; when it is not doubted, by the ingenious inventor, that a high rate of speed will be secured. Lieutenant Hunter's official reports are appended, as also the letter of the department on a trial of this vessel. The Princeton, with Ericsson's propellers, (a vessel of a most beautiful model, both for appearance and efficiency, constructed under the immediate direction and supervision of Captain R. F. Stockton,) has made a highly successful experimental cruise, under his command, to and about New York; the official report of which is hereto appended. --486-- Should these experiments, on further trial, equal the expectations now confidently entertained of them a new era will commence in steam navigation, and particularly in the use of war-steamers. Vessels that can move, at the pleasure of their commanders, against wind or tide, and whose machinery is beneath the reach of an enemy's fire, will be able easily to overcome and destroy any war-vessels of the ordinary structure. Improvements, of some magnitude, and of much utility, have been made, the past year, in the navy-yards at Portsmouth, N. H., Charlestown, and Gosport; and others are proposed, in the different yards, the ensuing year; for all the details of which I refer you to the appended report of the Chief of the Bureau of Navy Yards and Docks. For the service of the next year, the employment of the following force is proposed: For the home squadron, three frigates, six sloops, two steamers, and five brigs and schooners\u2014making, in all, sixteen vessels. For the Mediterranean, three frigates, four sloops, one brig, and one store-ship\u2014nine vessels. For the coast of Africa, four sloops, two brigs or schooners, and one store-ship\u2014seven vessels. For the coast of Brazil, two frigates, three sloops, one brig, and one store-ship\u2014seven vessels. For the Pacific, three frigates, four sloops, two brigs or schooners, and one store-ship\u2014ten vessels. For the East Indies, two frigates, two sloops, one brig, and one store-ship\u2014six vessels. For the Lakes, one steamer. For special service, the steamers Mississippi, Princeton, and Union, and the small iron steamer now building at the navy-yard, Washington. This increased force seems to be called for, to afford adequate protection to our national interests embarked in our increased and growing commerce on the distant stations. The force proposed to be added to the home squadron (the cruising-ground of which extends from Newfoundland to the river Amazon, in South America,) seems to be necessary in guarding our own shores; in protecting the immense capital employed in the coasting trade along our whole seaboard, from the St. Croix to the Sabine; and in giving countenance and assistance to our foreign commerce with the West India islands and with the ports on the American continent. The ships proposed to be employed are built and afloat. The officers necessary to command them are mostly in commission, and under pay. The deterioration of the ships is little more while in service than when laid up in ordinary. The officers degenerate by idleness, while they are improved by service. The expense of manning and sailing these ships, of course, is greater than when laid up. But we can have competent and skilful officers, good and efficient sailors, only by a long course of active sea service. That is the school in which they are taught, and in which they acquire a knowledge of their duties. To build a navy, without the experience, skill, and force necessary to sail and efficiently to manage it, in the event of a war with a maritime power, would be, in effect, but adding to the force of the enemy at the nation's cost, and to the national disgrace. I have, therefore, no hesitation in recommending the employment of a sufficient number of vessels to require the services of every officer that can be spared from shore duty, and capable of sea service. A slight increase of officers in the subordinate grades will be needed to keep this force afloat. I would recommend that the number of midshipmen be kept as high as it was at the beginning of this year. About --487-- ten more pursers could be beneficially employed. Several of the sailing-masters being, from age or infirmity, unfit for sea service, a small increase of the number is desirable. I would recommend that the proviso limiting the number of officers of the navy, which was passed on the 4th of August, 1842, be repealed, so far as it regards the warrant officers, excepting midshipmen; the present number being insufficient for the wants of the service. The appropriation for increase, repairs, &c. for the year 1843-'4, having been heavily drawn upon in payment of contracts made, and in the execution of plans, and the completion of works in progress anterior to the commencement of the present fiscal year, it was deemed necessary, in October last, to discharge a large portion of the persons employed under this head; leaving, however, it is believed, enough funds unexpended to meet most of the outstanding demands against the department chargeable to this appropriation. The act of Congress of the 31st August, 1842, which forbids the transfer of appropriations from one to another branch of expenditure in this department, has operated injuriously. Were these transfers permitted, it is believed that sufficient means might be found among the various unexpended balances of appropriations to pay most, if not all, needful outlays in the fitting, completing, and repairing of vessels, and for payments on uncompleted contracts; and I am fully persuaded that the public interests would be promoted were Congress to authorize these transfers early in the ensuing session. There were several contracts made, some of them years since, for the supply of timber and various materials for the navy, which have expired without having been completed. Heretofore, the department has been in the practice of extending the time for completing these contracts, where the interests of the United States have not suffered by such extension. The law of the 3d of March, 1843, requiring all contracts to be given by advertisement, to the lowest bidder, seems to prohibit their further extension. There are many contractors who would have large sums due them, on the completion of their contracts, for previous deliveries, but the ten per cent. reserved on the amount of those deliveries; but, in consequence of the non-extension and non-fulfilment of those contracts, these amounts remain unpaid. As the United States have suffered no loss by these delays, and as the parties expected an extension, according to former usage, it appears to be a proper case for the interposition of Congress for their relief. Congress provided for analogous cases, by an act dated February 10, 1832; and the passage of a similar act at this time would enable the department to effect an equitable settlement of these cases. It is not proposed to make any contracts the ensuing year for live oak, nor for any other timber, except absolutely required for immediate use; the department intending to build only four small timber vessels during that time, and the timber for which being mostly on hand. The docking of timber for long periods, a large portion of the time but partly covered with water, seems of very questionable utility; and there are some positive injuries arising from the practice. The timber is taken from the water, and, before allowing it time to dry, is hewn and put up for the frame of the ship. The planks are sawed from it, to cover the frame. The consequence is, great shrinking and liability to warp; requiring additional expense for calking, from the shrinkage of the flanks, and greater liability to leakage. It tends also to generate the dry rot, which --488-- disease (if I may so term it) appears to be a fungus, a parasitical plant, like mould, germinating in the wood, and destroying the tenacity of its fibre; which fungus would be less liable to germinate in dry than in moist wood. It is indeed doubted if it could germinate at all in perfectly dry wood. A deficiency is apprehended in the appropriation for provisions and clothing for the current year. The sum granted by Congress for this purpose was less than that asked for by the department, and not sufficient to provide for the persons actually in service at the passage of the law. Efforts are making to bring the expenditure within the proper limits; but, owing to the recent establishment of the Bureau of Provisions and Clothing, and the state of its accounts with the ships on distant stations, the department has not yet been able to learn the precise condition of its expenditures. About $15,500 worth of provisions, clothing, and small stores, has been lost by the burning of the steamer Missouri, the loss of the schooner Grampus, and the wreck of a freight vessel at Port Praya. The estimate from the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography is some five hundred and twenty-four thousand dollars more than the sum asked for last year; of this, about one hundred and sixty thousand dollars is to pay for outstanding contracts made by the Board of Navy Commissioners some years since, and yet incompleted. It includes also an estimate for a sufficient number of powder-tanks for all the ships and brigs of the navy, launched or not launched, that are not now provided with them. It likewise includes an estimate for two hundred cannon of a large size. In the Bureau of Yards and Docks, the estimate for the improvement of yards is about $180,000 over that of last year. The estimate for coal is on the supposition that each steamer will employ steam power four months in the year; and the sum asked for is a very liberal allowance even for this length of service. In the plot of ground on which the navy hospital at Chelsea, Mass., stand's, there are many acres more than are of any use for the purposes of that establishment, and producing no income. If this were sold, a handsome sum might be added to the hospital fund, and an income be received from it. I therefore respectfully recommend that Congress authorize the sale of so much of this land as will not be needed for the hospital purposes; and I would further suggest that the Navy Department be clothed with authority to invest the navy hospital fund, now amounting to over $200,000, and yielding no income, in some safe and productive securities. A resolve was passed by the late Congress, appropriating four thousand dollars towards establishing an agency in the State of Kentucky, and one in the State of Missouri, for the purchase of American hemp for the use of the navy. An agent was appointed on the 1st of July last for the State of Kentucky; and, in obedience to directions, he visited the United States rope walk at the Charlestown navy-yard, for the purpose of gaining information as to the kind and quality of water-rotted hemp used in the navy, and the mode of testing its strength. The appropriation for this branch of the naval service (increase and repair) having been mainly expended in other contracts, the department has recently directed the agent to make no purchases; and, in this state of the appropriation, it has not been thought expedient to appoint any agent for the State of Missouri: Mr. Von Schmidt, an intelligent gentleman, well acquainted with the --489-- culture of hemp in Russia and in this country, has been employed, by the direction of the department, the last season, on the culture and preparation of hemp, in this vicinity. He is now engaged in construe ting, a machine for breaking it and separating the fibres from the stalks without rotting. Should he succeed, (of which there is a fair promise,) a great saving of labor will be made; and the hemp thus prepared will be much superior, in quality and strength, to hemp prepared by the old method of rotting. Mr. Yon Schmidt's report is appended. He has also been employed to translate the pamphlet on the culture and preparation of hemp, published at Odessa, in Russia; and to which the attention of Congress was invited, by a communication from this department, dated 1st of March, 1843. The expense of this translation, for which there is no appropriation, is three hundred dollars. The translation is submitted with this report. I respectfully suggest a modification of the ration, so as to dispense with the spirit-portion now allowed. That the frequent and habitual use of ardent spirits injuriously affects the human system, is a truth believed to be now generally understood and admitted by all intelligent physiologists. Its evil influences are not less on the moral than on, the physical condition of man. A large proportion of the punishments inflicted upon the seamen is for drunkenness, or the immediate effects of drinking ardent spirits\u2014insubordination in its various forms. In abolishing the spirit-ration, punishments and disease will be less frequent, and the whole moral and physical condition and character of the men will be improved. I therefore cannot too strongly recommend that no spirits be allowed in the rations of those who enlist in future, and that the right of commuting the spirit-ration for money be continued to those already enlisted. Measures are in train for establishing a more perfect system of accounts for the naval storekeepers, by which a more rigid and effective responsibility will be enforced in keeping and disposing of the public property in the yards. In the execution of this plan, an additional clerk at each navy-yard is necessary. The sum estimated for each clerk is $800 per annum, and the services to fee rendered will vastly more than compensate for the outlay. Great expense has been incurred, at times, by alterations in the inboard arrangements of ships, without the authority of the department. The cost of such alterations thus made has been directed to be charged in future to the officer making them. Navy agents have been directed to pay no bills, except from funds in hand belonging to the appropriation to which the bills are chargeable. By this arrangement, the department will keep a better knowledge and more perfect control over the condition of the appropriations. The allowance of additional pay to officers performing the, duty of a higher grade, is often a subject of contention and perplexity, and is, liable to abuses. The utility of such allowances is somewhat questionable; but, if expedient to continue them, the law might be beneficially modified. It should define more accurately what constitutes a higher command, and perhaps also provide that no extra pay be allowed, unless expressly stipulated in the order directing the officer to perform such duty. Pursuant to the act of Congress of March 3d, 1843, Captain Rousseau, Commander Adams, and Lieutenant Stephen Johnston, have examined and surveyed the harbor of Memphis, in reference to its capability for a naval depot and yard for the building and repairing of steamships and --490-- other vessels of war at that place.\" The report of these officers has been received, and accompanies this. An appropriation of one hundred thousand dollars was made at the last session of Congress for the purpose of building a floating dry-dock, sufficiently large to raise a second-class frigate, on such plan as the Secretary of the Navy should approve, to be used at Pensacola. After various inquiries, the examination of various plans, and the consideration of the offers of persons proposing to build it, no plan was presented on which a suitable dock could be built within the limits of the appropriation; and the department did not feel authorized to enter into a contract requiring a larger expenditure than the sum appropriated for the purpose. The plan presented by S. D. Dakin, for a sectional dock, had the preference of the department; but one of a suitable size, with the necessary machinery to work it, could not be built within the sum appropriated. A detailed report on the subject, with an estimate of the cost of such a dock, to be used as the elevating or floating power, and connected with a level rail- track, by which ships can be taken upon the land with ease and safety, will be submitted in another communication, when all the necessary facts and calculations shall have been received from the persons having that subject in charge. Mr. Sanger, the engineer of the Bureau of Yards and Bocks, in compliance with the resolve of Congress, is making the necessary examinations as to the practicability of using the Croton water as an elevating power for a dock at New York. When his survey shall have been completed, the department will report upon that subject. In the estimates are included the cost of the apparatus for a laboratory at the Washington navy-yard, and for the employment of a chemist and pyrotechnist. It is believed that great advantages may he derived by employing scientific persons in testing the quality of copper arid various other materials, and in the preparation of many articles used in the service, which have heretofore been found, when used, of inferior quality. It is highly important that a competent person be employed in the preparation of fuses, rockets, and other fire-works, indispensable in the naval service. So deficient is the service in this knowledge, that the fuses necessary for its use are obliged to be purchased. The medical department of the naval service requires talent, education, and moral worth, properly to fill it, of as high order as in other branches of that service; but the surgeons and assistant surgeons have no military rank. A modification of the law, by which medical officers in the naval service shall be entitled to rank, in a manner similar to that prescribed in the army, might be beneficially made. Commander Wilkes, with the officers under him, has been assiduously engaged in preparing the hydrographical results of the exploring expedition for publication. Before the end of the year, forty plates of charts will be ready for publication, comprising upwards of seventy general and local surveys of the groups and islands of the Pacific. Many more are ready to be given out to engrave. Commander Wilkes reports that the narrative preparing by him, under the authority of Congress, will be ready for the press previous to March next. The naturalists and others are also employed in the description and arrangement of the several branches of natural history. For their pay, and that of the persons necessary in the keeping and attendance of the hall, --491-- and to complete the arrangements, a small appropriation is asked. The whole is making as rapid an approach to completion as can be expected in such duties. The report and estimate of Commander Wilkes are submitted herewith. In the general estimates for the half current year ending June 30, 1843, and the fiscal year ending June 30, 1844, fifteen thousand dollars are required \"for the erection of building for depot\" of charts and instruments. That sum is embraced in the amount appropriated for enumerated contingent expenses in the act of 3d March last; but \"the erection of building for depot\" is not specified therein, and the law prohibits the application of any part of the amount appropriated for \"other objects\" than those enumerated: therefore, legislation is necessary to perfect and legalize the application of the $15,000 to \"the erection of building for depot\"\u2014the object for which the amount was specified in the estimates, and for which purpose it is applied. I append the report of the superintendent of the building, in which he asks for an appropriation of $20,000 for grading the grounds, &c. The house he has estimated for would be convenient, but is not deemed essential at this time. It is proper to remark, that this building is adapted in its form and structure not only for a depot for charts and instruments, but for an astronomical observatory, and for other scientific investigations. It cannot but be gratifying to you to learn how great an interest has been evinced by the learned societies and scientific men of Europe, as well as at home, upon the establishment of an institution by the Government, in which a portion of the duties will be the advancement of science. Great liberality of feeling was expressed towards the officer sent abroad for the purchase of instruments; and, as another mode in which their great satisfaction was shown, extremely valuable presents of books were made to its library through him. Contracts awarded to the lowest bidder have been made the last year for some heavy ordnance; but the contractors have failed to fulfil their engagements, and, consequently, the guns have not been procured. The policy of giving contracts for supplies of such importance to the lowest bidder, in preference to known and experienced founders, is of questionable utility. But such is the present requirement of the law. The lowest priced guns are not always the cheapest. The loss of lives, during the last war, and since that time, from the bursting of guns on board our ships, is said to have been nearly as much as the loss from the enemy's shot. Ammunition, as well as guns, is, by law, to be procured in the like manner, from the lowest bidder. Powder, made from the nitrate of soda, in lieu of the nitrate of potash, appears as well, and is about as strong, when first made, as that manufactured from saltpetre, but deteriorates daily, and is nearly worthless in a few months; and yet this inferior ingredient cannot be detected, except by a chemical analysis. True economy, hence, would seem to dictate that a different rule than that of giving contracts to the lowest bidder, regardless of the skill and character of the manufacturers, should prevail in procuring the ordnance, arms, and ammunition for the service. A series of experiments have been made at the Washington navy-yard, by Professor Johnson, to test the qualities of coal of different kinds, a preliminary report of which is appended. Charles Reeder, Professor Johnson, and Dr. Thomas P. Jones, have been engaged in making ex- --492-- periments upon safety-valves for preventing explosions in steam-boilers. Professor Johnson has also made a series of experiments to test and improve the strength of iron, upon the principle of thermotension. After these several experiments shall have been completed, reports will be made concerning them. It has been found that the force allowed by the act of the 31st August, 1842, is inadequate for the performance of the duties required in an efficient administration of this department. An estimate has, therefore, been submitted for three additional clerks for the office of the Secretary of the Navy; three for the Bureau of Construction, Equipment, and Repairs; two for the Bureau of Provisions and Clothing; and one to take charge of all the books and papers of the late Board of Navy Commissioners, and the library of the department. The estimates from the different bureaus, and from the commandant of the marine corps, of the sums that will be required for the proposed service of the coming year, are sent with this report. All which is respectfully submitted. DAVID HENSHAW. To the President of the United States.

For 00| |6,983,245 64| --564-- ______________ A No. Bureau of Yards and Docks, November 25, 1842. Sir: I have the honor to present to you, in conformity to the directions contained in your letter of the 28th ultimo, the estimates for the improvements of the navy-yards; for the repairs of all the buildings which may require them; for the prosecution of the work on the new dock at New York, if it should be deemed proper to recommence it; and for the support of their establishments, including all the civil officers attached to each. The estimates for the support of the navy hospitals, for the preservation of the magazines, and for the ordinary of the various yards, are also included. The sums estimated for the yards for the first half of the ensuing year, and for the year beginning on the 1st July, 1843, and ending on the 30th June, 1844, are nearly in the same, proportion as those for the present year, making an allowance for the additional period for which they are required. The number of officers for duty in the yards, has been increased in order to insure a proper supervision of their duties; to secure a diligent and continual attention to the work to be performed, and to keep a careful watch by day and by night. To maintain, as far as practicable, their security, and to prevent theft and plunder, is another object of this increase, and a very important one. There is not now a sufficient force stationed at any of the yards for this purpose; and a police establishment for each, is much wanted; of what this police guard shall consist, may be a question for consideration. At present, there is neither a sufficiency of watchmen or of marines; and the demand for the latter on board ship prevents the expectation of our receiving from that source an increase. The watchmen, as at present furnished, are the principal reliances, and their organization, if the establishment may be so termed, is defective and requires amendment. The number should be increased, and they should be called upon to serve, for a certain period of time, under such regulations and written agreements as would be binding on them for their whole time and services, if it should be your intention to continue them. For the whole of the yards, the sum asked for the ensuing eighteen months is $514,756 56. The amount asked for the present year, was $504,428, making an excess of the former over the latter of only $10,328 56; although the period for which the first named sum is required, is greater than that for the last named by one half. Of the above amount of $514,756 56 for the period stated, the sum of $50,000 is intended to be applied to the construction of the dock, which being so costly and so important a work, as to form a specific object of appropriation, and a subject of distinct expenditure, does not, therefore, fall under the regular head of improvements of navy-yards, for which estimates are annually made. Beginning with the northernmost establishment, that of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, I proceed to state my views of each in general terms. The amount asked for it will be profitably laid out in the permanent improvements necessary to bring it up to a scale somewhat commensurate with the others, and to prepare it for carrying on expeditiously such work as may, from time to time, be deemed requisite. To do this the expenditures, after making provision for the repairs of all buildings and other works, are to be directed to a permanent quay-wall; a new wharf for the accommodation of vessels principally, --565-- and to some smaller works, which will add to the convenience and despatch of business. At Boston, the continuance of the boundary wall for the security of the yard, has become an object of importance, to preserve it from depredation, and to render it less accessible. The remaining objects to be commenced and accomplished, under this estimate, are also very requisite; and being in accordance with the approved plan, will do much to ensure expedition, economy, and safety, in the operations of the yard, and the preservation of materials. For New York, it has been considered proper to preserve all the different buildings in repair, and to estimate for the erection or building of such works only, as are requisite for the current or daily duties of the yard. The want of a proper and approved plan, by which all the future improvements of this yard may be regulated, prevents the call for a greater expenditure. When that is authorized, which it is supposed will be ere long, in a future estimate, such works will be embraced as will be calculated to bring it up to an equality of accommodation with the other dock yards. The uncertainty of a permanent location, within the waters of New York harbor, has hitherto prevented this point from being settled. It is, however, presumed this will not much longer be a matter of doubt. At Philadelphia, the principal object to be undertaken, is the extension and filling-in of the two principal wharves, which is rendered a work of indispensable necessity, by the accumulation of mud at their extremities, and the gradual shoaling of the water in their fronts, by the annual deposites of silt. These deposites are the consequence of the greater projection into the river, of the city wharves above or to the north of the navy-yard. The remaining expenditure will be confined to the preservation and repair of those objects which are in a state to require them. For the Washington yard, it is proposed to erect an iron foundry in which may be combined all the conveniences for castings and the making of steam engines, water tanks, chain cables, &c. This building, therefore; is of considerable importance, in point of economy and despatch. The present one is a mere temporary affair, by no means sufficient to the increased work; and is also most inconveniently situated. It was built, or converted to its present use, at a time when the demand for its services was by no means equal to the present exigencies. The wharf is also much needed; and experience shows that stone is a much cheaper material for its construction than wood; as the repairs, in a few years, would make it nearly equal in expense to that of the former material. The estimates for the other objects will be found, on reflection, to be equally necessary, including that for repairs, which last is much wanted at several points and parts of the yard. At Norfolk the improvements are to consist of a continuation of the timber dock, which is not only intended for the deposite and soaking of timber, but for the admission of vessels of light draught of water, loaded with stores of the various kinds, intended for the preparation and equipment of vessels, as well as the different species of timber which are required. In connexion with this large work, is the very useful one of a stone wharf or quay-wall, to the eastern or water front of the yard, a portion of which, from the north building slip to the south end or corner of building slip and house B, has been finished, and includes three permanent launching slips. These having been solidly constructed on piles, and with great care, may last for centuries. To continue this wall from the north building slip, as far as the north corner, or --566-- boundary, of the yard on that side, is a part of the work, to be done under this item, as well as its continuance (on the south part of that which has, as beforementioned, been finished) to the north side of timber dock. When this work is complete, to which it is expected the sum now asked will greatly contribute, there will then be an uninterrupted quay, extending from north to south of more than 900 feet. The erection of a new house, and the completion of a second, which are to be timber sheds and storehouses, form all the new works at present to be undertaken, with the exception of two small houses for the watchmen. The repairs of all the buildings, including painting, and the repairs which may be necessary for the dock, with the purchase and setting of some machinery for house number 36,; in which the sawing, turning and boring, are to be done for the whole establishment, comprise the remaining objects in this yard, for which an appropriation is asked for the ensuing prescribed periods. For Pensacola, as that yard is less advanced, in conveniences than the others; it has been considered proper, to ask for more than has lately been required, for it. The: necessity for a large and commodious wharf at this place, is so great, that in addition to the sum allotted to that object, out of the fund this year provided for improvements, it has seemed to be essential that a considerable addition should be made for this item. What is now asked for will, it is presumed, be sufficient. The houses for officers, now asked for in addition, are also much wanted for the accommodation of those who are required to do daily, and even night duty, without the means of procuring comfortable lodgings, if indeed any can be procured at all. The carrying of good wholesome water into the yard, for the use of our public vessels and for its inmates, will be attended with great advantages. Upon this, a subject of, such obvious importance, it is unnecessary to enlarge. It has been hitherto, and is yet, a great desideratum at that establishment, and felt very much by the crews of all the cruisers resorting to it for a supply, as it is difficult to procure it good, and then not without much labor. The other objects, although requiring much smaller sums to complete or accomplish them, are yet very necessary. Before closing this report, it may be proper to state, that the items for the repair of the different hospitals, have been made with a due regard to the urgency of the wants of those establishments; and the propriety of retaining them in a state capable of accommodating, in security and comfort, those who may need their services. For the magazines, of which there is one at, each of the Boston, New York, Washington, and Norfolk yards, a small sum has been required, sufficient for the purpose of keeping them in repair, improving their arrangement, and providing for unlooked-for damage by storms or other accidents, &c., &c. In making provision for the proposed improvements, care has been taken to preserve inviolate, the arrangements made by the officers of the commission of 1827 and 1828, for the examination and digestion of a suitable plan for each yard, according to which, all the buildings, slips, walls, quays, and docks, are to be erected or constructed. Such plans were formally approved by the President, in November, 1828, and have been implicitly followed since, with one or two slight variations, which it was found necessary to make to suit situations and circumstances, as experience and more particular information rendered them necessary. A revision of those will be made in the course of the winter and spring, by which you will be enabled to ascer- --567-- tain if any further change should be requisite, and see at one glance all that has been done, and all that is to be done to complete them. It is believed that little change, if any, will be necessary, as everything was settled, after great deliberation, consideration, and personal observation. The exception to this, is the New York yard, of which a plan was made by the late able civil engineer, L. Baldwin, Esquire, without having been submitted, however, to the commissioners, who determined the other plans, as it was not then known what spot might be ultimately fixed on as its site. The question of further improving and increasing this yard and to what extent, will be a subject for your decision, after all the requisite information shall have been obtained and laid before you. To enable you to do this with certainty, it is my intention in a short time to have a map on a large scale made, designating all the existing, as well as the proposed works, and laying down conspicuously its boundaries. The present limits, when those parts now marshy or overflowed are converted into solid ground, will, it is believed be sufficiently large at least for many years. I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant, L. WARRINGTON, Chief of Bureau. Hon. A. P. Upshur, Secretary of the Navy. _____________ Bureau of Yards and Docks, November 25, 1842, Sir: I have the honor to submit, on a separate sheet, the estimate of the amount necessary to the support of this bureau for the ensuing eighteen months, made for the periods of the first half of the next year, and for the twelve months following, as directed. I beg leave to call your attention to the salary of the chief clerk of this bureau, which has been the only salary of the clerks of the late Navy Board that is reduced by the act for the reorganization of the Navy Department. Under the late law it was $1,600; and I understand it was the intention of the committee which reported the bill to continue it as it was originally; but by an error or misapprehension in copying the bill for its engrossment, it was put down at the present rate. If it can be now remedied, and it is presumed it can be, it will be but an act of justice to one whose labors are certainly increased, although his income is curtailed. I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant, L. WARRINGTON, Chief of Bureau. Hon. A. P.

Sir: In compliance with your instructions of the 28th ultimo, I have the honor to submit the following report and estimates : The appropriation of $59,097 for ordnance and ordnance stores on the northern lakes, per act 4th August, 1842, and a balance of $12,692 79 of the appropriation per act of 3d March, 1841, for the continuance of the survey of the coast of the gulf of Mexico, appear to be the only sums for which this bureau has to account, all other appropriations for ordnance and ordnance stores having been merged in the general appropriation for \"increase, repair, armament, and equipment of the navy, and wear and tear of vessels in commission.\" These two sums of $59,097 and $12,692 79, are now in the Treasury, to the credit of this bureau. Under the administration of the late Board of Navy Commissioners, contracts were entered into, which, by their terms, are to be completed by the 31st of January, 1843, for\u2014 50 ten-inch Paixhan guns. 200 eight-inch do. guns of about 56 cwt. 60 thirty-two-pounder chambered guns of about 41 cwt. And for a proportionate number of shells and shot. More than a moiety of the guns and a large proportion of the shells and shot have already been received under these contracts, and are spoken of by the inspecting officers in terms of high commendation. Contracts were also entered into for 4,000 swords, 2,000 pistols, and 2,500 carbines, deliverable during the present and ensuing years; and this bureau has contracted for 2,000 barrels of powder, deliverable the 1st December next. --589-- Under the act of 4th August, 1842, appropriating $59,097, \"for ordnance and ordnance stores for the northern lakes,\" this bureau has entered into contract for 10 eight-inch Paixhan guns, 25 thirty-two-pounder chambered guns, and for the appropriate number of shells and shot, to be delivered at Sackett's Harbor, New York; For 10 eight-inch Paixhan guns, 20 thirty-two-pounder chambered guns, and the appropriate number of shells and shot, to be delivered at Buffalo,. New York; and For 10 eight-inch Paixhan guns, 25 thirty-two-pounder chambered guns, and the appropriate number of shells and shot, to be delivered at Erie, Pennsylvania\u2014all by the 15th of May, 1843. If the views of the late Board of Navy Commissioners, as stated in their report to the department, May 19, 1841, be adopted as the bases of all future estimates for ordnance and ordnance stores for the Navy, then there will be required for ordnance and ordnance stores for the ensuing year, an appropriation equal to that of September 11, 1841, of $600,000. If, however, it should be deemed inexpedient, at this time, to carry out the views of that report, then I would respectfully recommend that an appropriation for 100 guns, of about 25 cwt., with their equipments, be asked for, as a more suitable and efficient armament than the present, for our third class sloops-of-war, brigs, and schooners; an estimate for which accompanies this report, and in which is included a supply of small arms, copper powder tanks, &c., &c., deemed necessary to the proper armament and efficiency of the vessels now in commission, i The fact that almost all maritime nations have, as it appears, simultaneously, thrown aside the light gun and carronades, and adopted the long gun for their small vessels, would seem to render it absolutely necessary that we should, in self defence, and with a becoming regard for our national character, adopt similar armaments for our vessels. That the present is a most favorable time for providing a supply of ordnance and ordnance stores for our navy, maybe seen from the fact that the contracts recently entered into by this bureau for ordnance and ordnance stores for the northern lakes, have been at a cost full 33 1/3 per cent, less than heretofore made. Lieutenant Powell is charged with the survey of Tampa bay, and will trace the coast on as far as the mouth of the Mississippi. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, W. M.

CH. W. GOLDSBOROUGH. _____________ B. Estimate of clothing for the navy, for the half year, commencing January 1, and ending June 80, 1843. The whole number of persons employed on board our ships, and in our navy-yards (in the ordinary), is estimated at 10,343. Of these it is calculated that about 7,600 will draw their supplies of clothing from the Government stock. Each person heretofore, it has been estimated, has drawn, on an average, in 3 years, a supply of clothing equal to $175 70; but in consequence of the reduction in the price of materials, it is confidently believed that the estimate should be reduced to $150; so that the average each year would be $50, and the half year would be $25; then this estimate for six months will be 7,600 persons, at $25 each, $190,000. Clothing for the navy has heretofore been paid for out of the appropriation for \"pay, &c.\" of the navy; when issued, it has been charged to the men, as so much pay, and the amount thus issued has been restored to the appropriation for pay, &c.; but no particular account for clothing issued, has ever been settled between the pursers and the Government. Such account should show the number of each particular article of clothing delivered to, and issued by, the pursers; for instance, 1,000 suits are delivered by a storekeeper to a purser; the storekeeper is credited by the delivery, and the purser is charged and must account for each and every article received by him for issue. Another consequence which has been inconvenient to the service, is this: the actual available amount of the appropriation for pay, is reduced by considerable sums of that appropriation being vested in clothing at the very time when the whole appropriation has been required to pay off crews arriving from distant stations. Moreover, the appropriation for pay is reduced by every condemnation of clothing, the difference between its original cost, and the amount it sells for at public auction after being surveyed and condemned as unfit for issue in the navy, would show the amount of the reduction. Another consideration which appears to me to favor the proposition of a specific appropriation, is this: that having but one appropriation to rely on, the actual expenditures under the head of clothing, can be more --612-- readily ascertained, the accounts greatly simplified, and the actual cost clearly exhibited on the books of this bureau without referring to any other appropriation than that for \"clothing for the navy.\" No additional cost would arise from adopting this proposition. It is indeed hoped confidently, that the regulations recently adopted, will have a tendency to produce a considerable reduction of the expenses. So for will the expenses probably be reduced, that I would respectfully suggest that the expenses of transportation maybe included in an appropriation, without increasing its aggregate amount; so that the appropriation for \" contingent expenses,\" heretofore used to pay for transportation, will be saved the amount thereof, and the appropriation now submitted, can be worded thus: For clothing for the navy, including transportation, and every other expense, for the half year, commencing 1st January, and ending 30th June, 1843, $190,000.

Estimate of the expense of the Bureau of Provisions and Clothing, for the half year commencing January 1, and ending 30th June, 1843, agreeable to the 4th section of the act of 31st August, 1842, entitled, \"An act to reorganize the Navy Department of the United States.\" |For compensation to the chief of the Bureau, at $3,000 per annum||$1,500| |For compensation to the chief clerk, at $1,400 per annum||700| |For compensation to a clerk at $1,200 per annum||600| |For compensation to a clerk at messenger at $700 binding, and stationery||300| |For miscellaneous items||100| In submitting this estimate, a sense of duty requires that I should state that additional assistance is absolutely necessary to enable the bureau to keep the accounts coming under its cognizance. Every purser in the service, and every store-keeper, has accounts to settle, for all the various provisions, slop-clothing, and \"small stores,\" committed to his care, and for which he is held responsible. These accounts, as far as practicable, should be settled every quarter. In number they may exceed sixty for each quarter, and each account necessarily embraces a multitude of items which require particular and careful examination, involving many calls for explanation, preparatory to their being admitted for entry on the journal of accounts. The present --613-- chief clerk of the bureau has incessant employment, in performing the duties enjoined on him by the act of 26th August, 1842, section 13, in receiving and examining the monthly and quarterly returns of stoves and clothing received and expended at the stations, foreign and home, and on board all our vessels in commission, entering numerous invoices of shipments, and aiding in the correspondence of the bureau. Zealous and capable as the chief clerk is known to be, it has already become apparent that these duties are too heavy for any one individual; and when it is borne, in mind that all these accounts are to be entered in a journal, and transferred thence into a ledger, and such entries and transfers are all to be carefully examined, it will, it is hoped and presumed, be at once admitted, that additional assistance is absolutely necessary. The time of the second clerk allowed by the act of 31st August, 1842, is fully occupied by the duties arising under contracts. He has to prepare, not only the original contracts, but duplicates and triplicates, for transmission to commandants and agents; to record them; to enter and scale all bids for supplies; to receive and enter all returns as to the progress making in the execution of contracts: all payments upon them; all reservations; to prepare all advertisements for supplies, and see they are published as directed; to examine all advertising accounts, prepare them, if correct, for approval, and keep an account of all such as may be approved; and to aid in the correspondence upon all these subjects, and to record the same. The third clerk is fully employed in attending to the general records, and in keeping the requisition book, and the exhibits of moneys received and expended by the disbursing agents. Beside which, he has to aid in the general correspondence, and to prepare copies of letters and papers of various kinds. Hence, neither the 2d nor 3d clerk could reasonably be required to aid in the general accounts of stores and clothing, and such accounts could not be entered on the Journal, or spread upon the ledger without additional assistance. Two able, accountant in addition to the present force, would, it is hoped, be found sufficient to enable us to keep the accounts of the bureau, in such condition as would be satisfactory. I, therefore, respectfully submit the following additional estimate, viz: Two clerks, as accountants at $______ each per annum\u2014the half $_____ Bureau of Provisions and Clothing, November 17, 1842.

Sir: In obedience to your instructions of the 28th of October, the undersigned has the honor to submit the following preamble and estimates for the medical department of the navy: The preamble is deemed absolutely essential for a true understanding of the real condition of that part of the Navy Department which comes under the direction of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. The developments it contains are neither agreeable, nor, perhaps, expected. Yet it is right that Congress should be in possession of the facts showing the awkward condition of the medical department, in relation to its fiscal concerns. It is also just to yourself to show how much reform was needed in this branch of the service. It is but fair to the incumbent of this bureau, that the heavy demands existing on an appropriation which, for a series of years, seems to have been either insufficiently asked, or inadequately granted, in reference to the expenses that appropriation was designed to liquidate\u2014should be explained. That the annual appropriations for the outlays of the medical department have not been, in some years, anterior to that just passed, in parity with the current expenses of those years, the undersigned sees no occasion to take upon himself to assert. But that, in the series of years alluded to, the aggregate appropriations have not only not been commensurate with the aggregate outlay, he not only takes upon himself to say, but, also, that the deficit in the former, to bring them on an equality with the latter, amounts to a sum which, unless provided by a specific appropriation, will press heavily for years to come, on the usual medical appropriation, even by a process which would subtract a tithe of each year's giant for the gradual extinction of the present demands. It would, therefore, be equally disingenuous to assume these demands, in part, in the basis of estimates for future wants, thus vainly and uselessly, and, on the part of the undersigned, culpably endeavoring to conceal the embarrassment they occasion, and unwise to withhold any longer from Congress the fact that, until they arc wholly dissipated by specific funds, no economy can be apparent, as consecutive to the reorganization which introduced a bureau in this department, among the effects of the operations of which, economy was anticipated as an important one. To start in this bureau, under the just expectation by Congress and by yourself, of thrift and saving, with the clog of an aggregate debt of fifty thousand dollars, would he idle. This is the sum, at least, which, by a gradual increment from a previously unwise method of making estimates, meets, the undersigned in the fiscal part of his bureau. To dissipate the trammels of this residual sum after years of injudicious estimates, by gradually lessening it out of the annual appropriations, instead of acquainting Congress at once with the naked truth, would require that thirteen thousand dollars should annually, for four years, be abstracted from the medical fund! The result is plain, supposing this course should be adopted instead of the one the undersigned proposes of eclaircissement: that, for four years to come, the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery would seem TO INCREASE the heretofore usual appropriation, by thirteen thousand dollars annually!! That neither system nor economy could be imputed as a part of such wild operations, is clear; that unmerited blame and obloquy would be heaped upon this part of the reorganization, is equally plain; that an unjust unpopularity would meet its --617-- measures at every step, is not less manifest; and, finally, that its abolition' would be the probable issue, is unquestionable. With these general observations, the undersigned proceeds to the details within his knowledge, on which they have been based, after the following explanatory observations: The difficulty that meets the attempt at making the required estimates at the onset, has already been premised. Its cause, or causes rather (for there are several), will now be set forth. These estimates are for the moiety of the year approaching, ending on the 30th of June next; together with superadded estimates for the whole of the fiscal year thereafter, ending on the 30th June, 1844. To arrive at these would be a simple affair; but the simplicity of it becomes, instead, a complex calculation, by the existence of claims unappeased, to the amount already mentioned, in round numbers. When estimates were presented to Congress prior to August, 1842, for an appropriation of thirty thousand dollars to defray the current expenses of the medical department of the navy during the year 1842, there remained, on the day of the passage of the law granting the appropriation asked for, certain arrearages clue for outlays in the medical department to an amount, in the aggregate, actually exceeding, very considerably, the total of that appropriation. The whole of it was, therefore, swallowed up in less than a week after the passage of the act, although five months of the year thus seemingly provided for were in futuro. But this is not all. At least ten thousand dollars still remained due and unpaid. This sum ($40,000) had grown out of bills charged certainly, if not justly chargeable (which admits of doubt), to the appropriation for the medical department. The result is as manifest and intelligible as its sequence was natural. An appropriation for the whole of the year 1842 was extinguished in a few days to liquidate, although only adequate to do it partially, the debts of the year 1841, those of 1842 accumulating the while. The debts of 1840, with a similar retrogression, had, been paid also only in part, out of the appropriation of and for 1841; those in like manner of 1839 out of the appropriation of 1840, and so on by retrogressive shackle for perhaps a long course of years; each anterior year's debts bringing the additional increment of the portion left unpaid from the periods of time gone by, as an undecaying dead horse, the price of which was to be paid, sooner or later, out of funds set apart to buy food for the* living one. All this time Congress remained ignorant of the true state of things, believing that each annual appropriation was competent to its object, since it always reached the amount asked as competent for the year embraced. Thus the undersigned has brought you, by the simple statement of a state of things which quickly reached his mind, to a thorough understanding of the confusion which would continue, unless the affair be rectified, on the just and competent principles of cure. It only remains to say, that- whatever information this preamble may communicate, of a novel or unexpected nature, it was all forced on him with convincing celerity by the: power of figures, on the moment when his duty led him to investigate the fiscal concerns of his bureau, and to ponder the singular uniformity of navy agents' returns in the loaded column appropriated to \"amounts overpaid.\" The amazement, this uniformity and the large amounts of that column produced, can be better understood by you than explained by the undersigned. Sufficient ground for this will be admitted when he simply states that he had expected to see a clean and clear ledger, exhibiting the- --618-- distribution of the appropriation in parcels to those agents as debits for the year current, with simple offsets against these of credits for lawful outlays of that year from the medical appropriation. Far from this simplicity of grant and expenditure, the result of his scrutiny having found, not only the groaning columns of overpayments on account of the appropriation for \"medicines, &c.,\" but unwarrantable intrusions on the fund, especially for the support of the naval asylum, the irregularities in the administration of which you have promptly proceeded to correct, on the moment of the disclosures which the reorganization produced. The cause of all this is traceable, as has been stated, several years back, by the annual interlocking with each successive appropriation for any particular year the claims of some year anterior; thus leaving an apparent competent fund in a state of glaring incompetency to meet the objects it was lawfully designed to meet. This cause of insufficiency to liquidate the annual demands, was dilated by an immoderate expenditure, from year to year, far beyond the actual need of outlay for surgeon's necessaries and appliances; an immoderate expenditure growing out of a lax and irresponsible method of making requisitions, and obtaining; their approval by officers incompetent to judge of the necessity for them, either in kind or in the quantities asked for; and. still further enlarged, by an unrestrained and craft-inviting course, in having those requisitions executed. But these were not the only causes which impinged the strength of the appropriation. An additional one is found in the loss which the practised system of entire unaccountability engendered, of articles of imperishable nature, but costly price, and which had been obtained out of Congressional appropriations apposite to such expenditure. The necessity for replenishing these, admitted of no abatement from the fact, that, having once been obtained, they ought to have been preserved for future and other similar use to that to which they were first applied. The fact was evident that now they were gone. This overwhelmed every other view. No accountability existing, either by law, usage, or much individual exertion on the part of those concerned, but, on the contrary, any and every essay toward instituting it having been uniformly extinguished, by a constant refusal by the usual recipients to give receipts or vouchers for delivery of articles after return-cruises, it is neither surprising that losses of costly appliances ensued, nor is it strange that a continual drain was thus instituted on a specific fund destined, in part at least, to meet outlays of one year, which would last for the same purpose in the service, if well taken care of, for several consecutive years. It is easy to perceive how these causes might quickly impoverish an appropriation, even if it had been well devised to meet current expenses; but when it is remembered that a doubtful judgment had been shown, for years past, by those who furnished the Secretary of the Navy with the data for his estimates on the branch of the service in question; and that a policy not easily understood, or involving an unacquaintance, perhaps, with the veritable state of perpetuated claims, led to asking, or causing to be asked, of Congress, an appropriation wholly insufficient\u2014it becomes palpable that the irregularity and irresponsibility in making requisitions, and the exorbitant charges on their execution in, at least, one of our southern sea-ports, joined to the carelessness, waste, and loss produced, in the manner noticed, are causes in combination, adequate to produce their full share in contriving he embarrassments now complained of and exhibited. --619-- In truth, the appropriation, for one year, was often, if not always, virtually, though perhaps not apparently, foreclosed, for any benefit to that year's outlay, by the engulfing arrearages of the year or more previous. The real state of affairs in the medical department not being known, or being known, not having been developed, it became next to impossible to meet indefinite outlays or claims by definite appropriations. A similar difficulty would now exist, if any estimates were predicated on the unsound, policy of perpetuating the mystification which has characterized the medical outlay for years past. Under the full conviction of this, that specious and deceptive lure held out by narrowed estimates is now abandoned and anathematized. The plain truth, devoid of cloud or obscurity, is now before you, and the undersigned believes that you will better receive it than a mesh of intricacies predicated on calculations which must fall short of adequacy, if devoid of that foundation. There is nothing problematical in this policy. To disclose to you that which figures in the accounting books, and in the official returns of navy agents to his bureau, revealed to the undersigned, is a duty; to make that disclosure fully and fairly, is common honesty. It may not be without utility to observe here, that whatever may be the amount granted hereafter to the medical department, its integrity will most likely not be invaded by any of the irregular causes of diminution which have been noticed. Hitherto, there not having been any restraining influence over outlays, and no practicable method of recalling the material proceeds of those outlays into the storerooms for public property, nor any power exerted till lately (for the evil was not known to the power, until brought to light by the reorganization*) to stay a truly ruthless host of intrusions on the medical * Six hundred and sixty-five dollars and fifty-seven cents were, unauthorizedly, paid out of the appropriation for \"medicines, surgical instruments, &c.,\" for 31 blue cloth frock-coats, with navy buttons, and a silver star ornament, 31 pairs blue cassimere pantaloons, and 31 blue cassimere vests, with navy buttons\u2014and all this toggery for \"Jack\"\u2014for pensioners who never had worn anything longer than a sailor's jacket, or at most, in storms, a monkey or pea jacket, the cost of which is eight dollars, instead of fourteen dollars charged for the frock-coats, made in officer's undress fashion. This will serve to show the unwarrantable intrusions on the appropriation for medicines, referred to in the text. But it may more strongly be set forth by this fact: of seven thousand one hundred and twenty-one dollars and sixty-four cents, paid by the navy agent at Philadelphia, from the 1st of October, 1841, to the 25th of October, 1842, out of the appropriation for \"medicines, &c.,\" only one thousand and forty dollars and nineteen cents were for medicines, surgical instruments, and surgical purposes. The remaining six thousand one hundred and eighty-one dollars and forty-five cents were for items of expenditure, wholly foreign to the intent of the appropriation, and, of course, were what have been appropriately called intrusions on the fund, not known to be practised, nor thought of by Congress, when they made the appropriations in question. How could thirty thousand dollars, appropriated for the whole naval service, for the whole year 1842, be deemed sufficient, when a mal-administration of the fund, on one station, swept off at once, in a few days more than twelve months, $6,181 45, not lawfully chargeable to the medical fund? Could the balance, $23,818 55, be for a moment thought competent to supply all the ships, sick quarters, hospitals, &c., in the United States, for a whole year? That this mal-administration may be understood, the navy agent's return to the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery is annexed, in toto, as an appendix. It will not be understood, however, that the slightest blame is imputed in these irregular transactions, to that gentleman, officially, or in any other way. The irregularity is chargeable, and it is now unhesitatingly charged, on the governor of the naval asylum, who approved the bills, and thus ordered their payment out of an appropriation which no sophistry could make chargeable with such burdens. In addition to these irregular outlays, the sum of $3,500 is reported on the purser's pay rolls, as paid, annually, for wages or pay alone (exclusive of officers' pay), in that institution\u2014$428 of which, is the wages of a person rated and paid as hospital steward, who never performed five minutes' duty as such in the hospital, but was employed solely as purser's clerk, and to buy provisions for which he was regularly paid, as any agent not connected with the institution might have done. Of this whole amount of $3,500 for wages (the subsistence of those so paid, being a further change, and paid out of the appropriation for medicine), only $936 were allowed in the estimates of the Secretary of the Navy, and, subsequently, $303 per annum were allowed for a carpenter's mate, making $1,239 allowed: the balance, $2,361, being entirely unauthorized, to near the whole amount, the residue, to speak cautiously, at least very doubtfully authorized. --620-- appropriation\u2014the inroads on which, conveyed the thought, to cool lookers- on, that its fastness must have been considered impregnable, and its resources exhaustless; nor, seemingly, any fear of that power, for, among other impoverishing drains, the appropriation has been made the passive, patient, enduring instrument of a whimsical prodigality\u2014which it would be affectation to call by any other name\u2014of a \"tissue of taxes, absurdly conceived, and unauthorizedly levied by a se-ipse expenditure (for a naval charity), the grotesque character of which is equally anomalous and queer; nor, as it would seem, any chastened appreciation of the intent of the appropriation\u2014else this dwindling away of the easily-told contents of small coffers, at best, would, under the review of any rational intelligence, have quickly conveyed the self-evident truth that those coffers could no more- be expected to defray such profuseness, than the recipient of a parish- bounty could be thought able to pay the rent of the almonry which gives him food, raiment, and shelter; nor, finally, above all, any gleam of accountability emanating from the confused mist surrounding the disjointed and schemeless way of furnishing the general supplies of the medical service:\u2014nothing, of all these propositions (which, in the aggregate, make up a true sorites deducible from facts) existing in the service, the conviction that kind of argument produces is logically irresistible\u2014that heretofore it would have been the greatest, hardihood to have promised, or expected, a faithful distribution of any appropriation on which drafts were irremediably inordinate, irregular, prodigal, if not. senseless, and often wholly useless for any purpose, save enriching the rapacious furnishers. That this epithet is merited by some, is, unfortunately for the weak and groaning medical appropriation, but too true. To their extortionate and unconscionable charges, especially for surgical instruments,* the under- * It may illustrate this remark to state, that the records of this bureau show that an eminent surgical instrument maker, of Philadelphia, sold certain instruments of his manufacture, of the first-rate workmanship and approved pattern, for the sum of $669 81 to certain druggists largely supplying the medical outfits of vessels in a neighboring seaport. The commission alluded to in the text, conducted by Benjamin Homans, now of the Navy Department, shows that these identical instruments were furnished by the druggists alluded to, to certain vessels, and that they charged Government for them the sum of $1,224 54; thus exhibiting a profit of $554 73\u2014in other words, an exorbitant charge of about 83 per cent.! This, too, on articles of well-known established price. These prices were approved in the usual way, and actually paid. The same commission brought to light, from actual vouchers, the charge by the same druggists of $287 82, in four years, for the recipients of medicines and freights, although they state, on oath, that the \" drayage, freight, &c., was always paid by them.\" Epsom salt was invariably charged, in wholesale quantities, at ten cents per pound, when it can anywhere be purchased, of wholesale dealers, at five cents, and even much less. Half an ounce of veratria* was charged at eighteen dollars! An ounce of gold is worth sixteen dollars (a doubloon, or ounce). Thus was a small white powder charged at thirty-six dollars an ounce\u2014four dollars more than twice the value of an ounce of gold. One ounce of strychnine, a similar powder, was charged at thirty-four dollars; that is, two dollars more than twice the value of an ounce of gold. Two dozen bottles Bedford spring water were charged eight dollars, viz: thirty-three cents per bottle. Two scabs of vaccine virus were charged at nine dollars. Oiled silk, worth, of the best quality, $1 37 1/2 per yard, was charged eighty dollars for twenty yards; that is, four dollars per yard. Seventy-two bottles compound sirup sarsaparilla were charged at $108; viz: $1 50 a Bottle. The retail price is everywhere seventy-five cents a bottle, and it has been purchased by this bureau in Philadelphia, at $7 50 per dozen, or $49 for 72 bottles. In the examination of vouchers by the same commission, still more extortionate charges appeared on some articles. In short, the whole of the charges now printed in the documents of Congress are of the same extortionate character. The illustrations given are ample to prove the truth of the remarks in the text, on the rapacity of furnishers. Of $42,504 34 paid by a navy-agent at the seaport alluded to, out of the appropriation for \"medicines, &c.,\" these furnishers received $22,676 10. ______________ * Philadelphia prices to this bureau: veratria $10 50 by one firm of chemists and $10 by another; the wholesale of these poisons being ounces and one and half ounces. Philadelphia price to this bureau, by one firm of chemists, $7 per ounce; by another, $6 50 per ounce, avoirdupois; the wholesale also of this poison being ounces and one and half ounce. Some difference existing between the manner of putting these articles up, by the two firms, their prices may be said to be about equal for the drug. --621-- signed has called your attention. They in part, but doubtless not to the extent of a tithe of the occult freebooting which for years has been in operation, under the guise of fair profit, have been brought to light by a report to Congress now in its printed documents. That report resulted from an investigating commission instituted by your immediate predecessor, with that peering scrutiny into irregularities and abuses for which he was remarkable, and which has in the same sharpness been instituted by yourself, and carried out (from a conviction that reform could no longer be postponed, consistently with the public interests), into a digested system of reorganization, which is hourly presenting additional facts to confirm the necessity for establishing, continuing, and expanding that reorganization. These hourly revelations are, at least in the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, absolutely amazing. The difficulty of making, with any prospect of redemption, such a promise as has been above touched on, or realizing any such expectation as alluded to, would hitherto have been further enhanced by the practice heretofore pursued, of making good an exhausted appropriation by borrowing temporarily from another. But pay day was to come at last; the undersigned has shown you that its approach is as vicinal as the demands with which it is fraught are importunate and insusceptible of postponement. Procrastination will not mend, but mar that measure which, only, can bring the issue right. The enlightened views of Congress, once invited to this measure of fiscal appeasement, would by the undersigned be confided in to meet the emergency. You, doubtless, are inspired with the same confident reliance on their just sense of necessity for something to be done effectual, thus ultimately closing the door, so long and injuriously to the public credit, wide open for the ingress of irregularities, varied, mischievous, and odd. In a word, a specific appropriation to obliterate retrospective claims, would block out that door by raising an impenetrable barrier against future abuses and irregularities. That measure once accomplished, nothing of the anomalous operations which have been developed and complained of, can be interposed (if the incumbent of this bureau does his duty) to prevent a due regard in keeping without intrusion all future appropriations. The existing scores once erased by payment, the course will be clear for economy and thrift. The goal at the end of that course can be reached in no other way. An unsettled ledger would perpetuate embarrassment, by withholding the ready money which ought to find its way into cash payments for supplies, and diverting it into the channel clogged with the obstacles of debt and discredit\u2014it might be said, no credit at all, for the smirch it has sustained, if not indelible, is so deep as to have actually frustrated the economy which would have been the result of cash payments by the bureau. There has been no reciprocity in the borrowing complained of, but what added to the evil. In short the medical appropriation having been made to bear the burden of a collapsing pressure, meager, ill-conditioned, ill-provided, as it has been, it was ever seized on in such plumpness as recent Congressional action may have given it, grappled with, thrown down, filched, and picked to the bone, by voracity in the furnishers, and by the relentless tugs of the visionary and the inconsiderate. The evil exhibited is considerable and pervading, but not inextirpable. Fortunately, the remedy is at hand. Should Congress deem it right and expedient to meet the emergency by the annihilating power it possesses, that course would --622-- dissipate the mystified condition of the concerns which now come under the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. Until that step be taken, all attempts at reducing the medical appropriation to the square-and-compass test will prove fallacious, deceptive, and unavailing. When taken, the appropriation may thereafter be in good understanding made, and in good faith expended. It is now, therefore, submitted to your consideration whether it might not be well to lay these facts before the appropriating power, and ask for the requisite funds to release the accounts, in abeyance, from all prospective trammel or postponement. This would render the operations of the bureau fully perspicuous and effectually economical. It would, too, relieve its chief from floundering in future amid debts and drawbacks, which otherwise would create a vis inertia inimical to the object of its institution, and fatal perhaps to its existence. This may be a fit place to suggest what the undersigned can not but deem a modification in the future medical appropriation, imperatively called for by the principles of unity in purchases, requisitions, issues, and accountability, adopted in this bureau. The modification alluded to has reference to that distinct appropriation, heretofore recognised, for the medical disbursements for the marine corps. This separation of objects homogeneous in their nature and uses, presents an unnecessary distracting influence over the medical department of the navy; and moreover, the distinct appropriation exhibits Often, an ungainly disproportion to that for the service of the navy proper. In the present year, for example, that disproportionate unsuitableness between means and the objects they are to embrace, was very striking\u2014$4,140 to $30,000. When the relative numerical strength of the navy proper, and the marine corps, is glanced at, this injudicious, variance in proportion will be readily perceived. There are other reasons for amalgamating the two appropriations involving the good of the service, in the generalization now aimed at in the bureau. After maturely considering all the aspects of this hitherto distinct appropriation, the undersigned is unable to perceive any good reason for continuing as a separate item of appropriation, the funds for the sick and hurt of the marine corps. Indeed, he can find, in the whole view of the subject, not only no reason, good or plausible, why it should be distinct from the general naval appropriation, but every good and sufficient reason that might be fairly asked for, why it should not be perpetuated in separation. They may be summed up in these: The naval surgeons in all instances, without exception, perform the duty of medical officers to the marine corps, from headquarters down to the smallest guard allotted to vessels of war. In many instances, notwithstanding the separation of appropriations that have a common object and tendency, the necessaries and appliances for the sick and hurt marines, are drained from the supplies obtained out of the appropriation for the naval service proper. The same kind of drain carries away a large portion of the supplies on board of all vessels having a marine guard. There remains, perhaps, only the medical department of the marines at headquarters in Washington, to be supplied out of the specific and distinct appropriation for marines. There does not seem any appropriate cause, or plausible, much less valid reason, why this should continue, especially now that all requisitions and approvals, both for the articles and the payments for them, originate or are entertained and adjusted, in the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. If all requisitions then and the administrative surveillance of them --623-- preparatory to payment, exist in one office, there seems to be much propriety in suggesting that the funds should be a unit for the two objects. Should this state of separate appropriation be not hereafter set aside; the result will inevitably be an irruption on the unity of action, expenditure, issues, and accountability, general and fiscal, which ought to be maintained inviolate in the concerns of this bureau. The primitive cause of the usage is not known, nor can its necessity be defended on any stable ground. For these reasons it is now submitted to you, whether the present would not be a fit opportunity so to modify the next solicited appropriation for the sick and hurt, as to embrace, under one general head, the navy proper and the marine corps. In addition to this improvement in the essential base of the appropriation for the sick and hurt of the navy, the undersigned takes occasion to suggest another, less essential or important, but still an improvement, which, if, adopted, would not be without its advantage. It relates simply to the phraseology of the appropriation as it has heretofore been expressed. The nomenclature of appropriations is entirely conventional; and it is presumed something of appositeness in the funds required to the objects they are destined to procure, is intended to exist. Under this idea it is suggested, that hereafter the funds given by Congress for the medical department be styled \"an appropriation for surgeons' necessaries and appliances for the sick and hurt of the naval service, including the marine corps.\" The phraseology of the appropriation as heretofore used, is not in sufficient generalization. The details expressed, even, form but a small part of the whole of these multifarious necessaries and appliances for the use of the sick and hurt: and hence, it seems strange to designate them by a virtual misnomer, and to suffer them, a mere part of a multitudinous whole, to give a nomenclature for the appropriation. The generalization of the subject seems more proper; and the title of the appropriation now proposed seems to embrace that generalization. It will be perceived that the sum of one thousand five hundred dollars has been appended to the estimates, for the purchase of surgical instruments. This requires some explanation. The instruments of the medical department of our service, are, confessedly, in a state of imperfection. Nay, notwithstanding the large sums heretofore annually paid for them, many are good for nothing, or, at least, indifferently passable. This is owing to the incorrect manner of procuring them without any responsible judge of their workmanship and pattern. But a more important fact must not be withheld. Much money has annually been spent for instruments, both good and indifferent, for twenty or thirty years past, and yet, where are they? Who can tell? Many are gone, very many. That the undersigned can tell. Whither, who can say? None having been responsible, in the slightest degree, for them\u2014none seriously and officially charged with their custody, it would, indeed be difficult to say whither gone. But it avails not to speculate. Gone they are, and they must, if the navy exists, be replaced. The reorganization you have effected, will render it impossible, for cause, to put these unanswerable interrogatories in future. The defective and indifferent instruments still remaining ought to be sold. The proceeds of such sale, reverting to the medical appropriation, from which they were purchased, will, when effected, lessen virtually the grant solicited for the purchase of these indispensable portions of surgeons' necessaries and appliances. Under this candid reveal- --624-- merit of the facts connected with these expensive outfits, it is not doubted that Congress will see occasion to make the grant. One other grant is suggested as really needful, in the opinion of the undersigned, but as it is of novel character, he prefers asking you to leave the sum unnamed, requesting of Congress that whatever importance may be attached there, to the request, it may meet with a corresponding degree of liberality in the sum appropriated. The object referred to in the suggestion for a grant of money to meet it, is intimately connected with the efficiency of medical officers. It is, that a small compact medical and surgical library shall be authorized to be purchased for each vessel of war, in proportion to her size and capacity for the accommodation of books in the surgeon's department, and also for the hospitals and sick quarters of navy-yards. A due responsibility for these, well devised and rigidly enforced, would secure them always, for each successive cruise, subject only, to the losses and destruction incident to the disasters of the sea. Extensive and costly libraries are furnished by Government to the commanders of all ships in the navy, often embracing a large proportion of mere general literature. Professional works, so important to medical officers, should not be denied. All which is most respectfully submitted by your obedient servant, WILLIAM P. G. BARTON. Hon. A. P. Upshur, Secretary of the Navy. --625-- Abstract of bills paid by Thomas Hayes, Navy Agent, Philadelphia, from, the 1st of October, 1841, to 31st October, 1842, under the November 5, HAYES, Navy Agent. _____________ F.

Headquarters of the Marine Corps, Washington, November 19, 1842. Sir: I enclose to the Department estimates for the Marine corps for eighteen months from the 1st January next. In the first half year of 1843, I have caused to be inserted items for purchasing ground, and commencing the building of barracks, at four stations. Appropriations for this object were twice, at least, made by Congress, and for some unaccountable cause, were not used for that purpose and returned into the Treasury. I remain, with great respect, your most obedient servant, ARCH. HENDERSON, Colonel Commandant. Hon. A. P. Upshur, Secretary of the Navy. ____________ Headquarters of the Marine Corps, Washington, November 14, 1842. Sir: I have the honor to report to the department that, in the course of the present year, I have inspected the men and their quarters at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Charlestown, Massachusetts, New York, Philadelphia, and Norfolk. At each of those stations there is a force so small as to be inadequate to afford protection to the public property. The accompanying general return of the corps will show the force at each of those stations, as follows: At Portsmouth, 19 privates; at Charlestown, 51 privates; at New York, 58 privates; at Philadelphia, 37 privates; and, at Norfolk, 55 privates. At Pensacola, there are 25, and, at headquarters, 73 privates\u201420 of these are to be. shortly sent on board the steamer Union. At Portsmouth there are two men sick, and one on daily duty, and four as a boat's crew, leaving but twelve for guard duty; and the daily guard is but four privates, which can furnish but one sentinel. At Charlestown, the last muster-roll shows seven privates sick, four on daily duty, and four on police duty, leaving but thirty-four for guard duty. In regular military service, not more than one third of the effective strength is on guard at one lime. Commodore Nicholson, in a letter to the department of recent date, says, that eight or ten sentinels are required for the navy-yard\u2014one, at least, is required at the barracks\u2014making eleven sentinels on post constantly. To accomplish this, a guard would be composed of thirty-three privates; and, to furnish a regular and proper relief to this, would take sixty-six effective privates; each private of a guard is eight hours of the twenty-four on post. At New York, the last muster-roll shows forty-two effective men to furnish the same number of sentinels as are required on the Boston station. The muster-rolls of the other four stations show about the same results. Portsmouth is the only station where the barracks can be considered as permanent. At Boston and Philadelphia, the ground on which the barracks are now placed is required for naval purposes; and the barracks themselves are too small for the number of officers and men. At New York, Norfolk, and Pensacola, there are no barracks at all. If guards of marines are to be employed on those stations, the propriety of building barracks to receive them is evident. The alms-house at Brooklyn --631-- is now rented for the marines there, and temporary quarters are provided for the guards at Norfolk and Pensacola. In the estimates for the corps, an appropriation for purchasing ground and commencing these barracks will be asked for, and I trust it will meet your sanction. By the general returns, it appears that there are now on board of the several ships of war, 2 captains, 7 first lieutenants, 8 second lieutenants, 59 sergeants, 66 corporals, and 647 privates. Captains Dulany, Macomber, and Brevoort, are under orders to join the Home, the Brazil, and the Pacific squadrons\u2014making five captains on sea duty; three are in the staff, and one, from a paralytic affection, unfit for active duty, leaving but four captains for a relief to those on sea service. When the ships receive the number of lieutenants to which they are entitled, there will be at sea 18 first and 19 second lieutenants. In addition to the vessels now in commission, guards will shortly be wanting for the steamer Union and the squadron for the coast of Africa; one hundred and eight privates, with the usual number of non-commissioned officers, will be required, increasing the number at sea from 647 to 755 privates. I would further call your attention to the fact, that, though so large a portion of the corps is at sea, there is but one single vessel that has a full guard\u2014 the Fairfield, sloop-of-war. It will also appear from the accompanying table (marked No. 2), that, to provide full guards for the different vessels now, and soon to be in commission, a force considerably larger than the whole present strength of the corps will be necessary. The experience of our own service, as well that of the English, shows that not less than one private marine for each gun should be on board a ship-of-war. Table No. 2 carries out this principle; and, exclusive of the steamers and receiving-ships, gives 878 privates for sea duty during the ensuing year. Fifty on board each receiving-ship, and twenty on board each steamer, would raise the number to over 1,100. The most effective crew for steamers is yet undecided. In reports to the department, I have heretofore hazarded an opinion that soldiers, drilled both as infantry and artillery, could not fail to be essentially useful in them. So far as I have been able to obtain further information on this interesting point, it has tended to strengthen this impression; and I hope I do not exceed my appropriate limits in bringing this subject to the attention of the department. It will appear from the general report, that the only surplus over the legal strength of the corps is now in the non-commissioned officers and music. The present year's estimates provide for 1,068 privates, including the 68 servants for officers. The corps is, therefore, 51 short in its privates, and 86 over in non-commissioned officers and music\u2014making, in all, 35 over its proper strength. At the end of this month, the excess over its numerical legal strength will be very small. It does not follow that an increase of the marine corps necessarily increases public expenditure. For every additional marine on board a ship-of-war, there is a landsman less. At the navy-yards watchmen are now employed to give security to the public interests. An increase of the corps would render this expense unnecessary, and would afford additional security by a guard under naval law, and, consequently, responsible for its efficiency and fidelity. I remain, with great respect, your most obedient servant, ARCHIBALD HENDERSON, Colonel Commandant. Hon. A. P. Upshur, Secretary of the Navy. --632-- [Pages 632 and 633 represent one table.] General return of the officers, table.] privates, of the United States Marine Corps, for the month of Oct'r, 1842. |Fifers.||Privates.||Aggregate.||Remarks.| |5||70||147||Twelve sergeants, 1 corporal, and 23 privates, on daily duty as clerks, mechanics, &c.; and 12 privates returned here are boys learning music.

Sir: I have the honor to transmit, herewith, in obedience to the 3d section of the act of Congress, of the 10th of July, 1833, entitled \"An act for the regulation of the navy and privateer pension, and navy hospital funds;\" six lists, viz: 1. A list containing the names of widows whose pensions ceased on the 31st of August last, in conformity with the provisions of the act of the 16th of August, 1841, entitled, \"An act to provide for the payment of navy pensions.\" 2. A list of orphans whose pensions expired on the 31st of August last, agreeable to the provisions of the act of August 16, 1841. 3. A list of widows pensioned since the last annual report was made from this office, some of whose pensions ceased on the 31st of August last. 4. A list of orphans pensioned since the last report, whose pensions ceased on the 31st of August last. 5. A list of widows who are now on the pension roll under the act of June 30, 1834, granting five years' half-pay. 6. A list of persons who are now on the roll of invalid pensioners. The invalids constitute the only list of permanent navy pensioners now left. There are at present 503 on the rolls, and there is now in the Treasury an undrawn balance of this year's appropriation of $31,123 33, which will be sufficient to pay them on the 1st of January next, and to meet all other demands for the first quarter of the ensuing year. To pay the invalids now on the rolls, and those who may be added during the first half year of 1843, as well as the widows under the act of June 30, 1834, granting five years' half-pay in certain cases, and widows and orphans' claims still unsettled, under the act of March 3, 1837, the sum of $27,800 will be required for the half year ending June 30, 1843, viz: invalids, $18,000; widows under the act of June 30, 1834, $1,800; and widows and orphans' claims under the act of March 3, 1837, $8,000. For the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1843, the sum of $49,600 will be required, making necessary an appropriation of $77,400 for the years 1843 and 1844. The only stocks now belonging to the navy pension fund are, 700 shares of the Bank of Washington, the nominal value of which is $14,000; and stock of the Union Bank of Georgetown, the nominal value of which is $8,700. The last-mentioned institution is now closing its concerns; and, as soon as collections can be made, the directors will pay from the dividends of its capital stock, the amount due to the navy pension fund. Since my report of November, 1841, $900 have been paid into the Treasury by this hank, which has been applied to the payment of pensions, as will be seen by the 4th Auditor's report, which has been sent to you. The stock of the Bank of Washington can not now be sold to advantage, and the amount of interest which it yields is so inconsiderable, that I have not introduced it into the present report as available. The sum of $2,500 received for interest on Cincinnati corporation stock, and applied to the payment of navy pensions, since the date of my last report, was due to the navy pension fund before the stock was sold. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, J. L. EDWARDS, Commissioner of Pensions. Hon. A. P. Upshur, Secretary of the Navy. --658\u2014 ____________ 1.
