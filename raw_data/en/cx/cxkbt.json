Do you need a prescription for an anti-nausea medicine, such as Zofran\u00ae, or are there safe, non-prescription alternative remedies that will work, including homeopathic treatments? Homeopathic or alternative treatments have been used during pregnancy and birth for centuries. There isn't always research to measure their effectiveness, so like many pregnant women, you may be wondering\u2014what works? What's safe? And what should you avoid? Alternative medicine includes treatments such as acupuncture, chiropractic medicine, and herbal remedies. Homeopathic remedies are based on the principle that \"like cures like.\" Remedies are made from very minute amounts of the same substances that might cause the symptom or illness, but in these minute amounts the substance stimulates the body to heal itself. Holistic medicine begins with the basic philosophy that mind, body and spirit work together. Homeopathic remedies are usually very individualized treatments, and for this reason it's best to find an experienced Homeopathic provider who has experience in working with pregnant women. These treatments aren't regulated by the FDA, unlike prescription medications; they're generally recommended as directed by the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the U.S. And although your cousin may swear ginger root tea cured her morning sickness, you may need to try more than one remedy to learn what works best for you. Always tell your healthcare provider what medications, over-the-counter products and alternative or homeopathic therapies you're using; you may even be surprised if they recommend some of these from our list of popular therapies here for you to try as well. Although complementary and alternative remedies and medicines may be available without a referral from your provider, it's important that your pregnancy care provider is also aware of what you're taking so that information can be included in your medical record, and to ensure they don't conflict with other medicines or treatments you might receive.

It's worth noting that even though these methods are popular, none of these are proven in research to induce labor: Intercourse: It's believed prostaglandins in semen may help soften (ripen) the cervix. Intercourse also may stimulate an orgasm, which is a uterine contraction and can encourage the start of labor. Acupuncture or acupressure: Pressing firmly for about 5 minutes per side every 30-45 minutes for up to 10-15 times on the acupressure point between the thumb and forefinger or on the inside of the shin bone about 3 finger widths above the ankle bone. This can be uncomfortable. Herbal remedies: Evening primrose oil; castor oil, is a laxative that may bring on very strong, frequent contractions as well as diarrhea, which can put you at risk for dehydration. Castor oil may be associated with your baby passing his first stool (meconium) while still in your womb, so although it may be advised by some practitioners, it's not recommended by leading medical and nursing experts. Stripping the membranes: Your provider may try to stimulate prostaglandins (naturally occurring hormones which prepare the cervix for labor) and contractions after 39 weeks by placing a finger through the cervix and between the lower portion of the uterus and the membranes. This can be very uncomfortable and may cause some spotting. Read these tips on [How To "}
