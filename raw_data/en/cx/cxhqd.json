Ah, how relaxing. The stress of the day fades away - it's as if the volume in your head was turned all the way down. You immediately feel a sense of calm and inner peace. Along with promoting relaxation, there are many healing benefits of aromatherapy. As an all-natural alternative medicine, aromatherapy uses essential oils taken from flowers, peels of plants, leaves, stems, bark, seeds, and roots. When essential oils are inhaled they have been proven to be beneficial for people with various health issues. Dating back to ancient Egyptians and Greeks, essential oils have been used for both religious and medicinal purposes. During World War I, French soldiers returning home were given aromatherapy not only to treat their wounds, but also to reduce anxiety and the PTSD from battle. Today essential oils can be found everywhere, ranging from candles and perfumes to spa treatments and meditation classes. Essential oils can be used through inhalation, ingestion, or absorption through the skin. Did you know essential oils are now being used in hospitals? Recognized for their ability to treat anxiety, depression and infection, more and more medical professionals are jumping on board. In fact, many aromatherapists are also massage therapists, psychologists, and chiropractors. According to [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19962101), pre-operative patients who tried aromatherapy with lavander oil reported being less anxious about their surgery compared to the control group. \"There is some high-quality evidence that essential oils are effective in treating viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections, and in providing relief from sleep difficulties and pain,\" says [Dr. Wolfgang Stefiltsch](https://www.livescience.com/52080-essential-oils-science-health-effects.html?cmpid=514627_20150903_51927336&adbid=10152977244841761&adbpl=fb&adbpr=30478646760), vice president of the Austrian Association of Aromatherapy and Aroma Care. \"The oils may also improve moods, such as anxiety, depression, and reduce stress. How Aromatherapy Works The essential oils in aromatherapy activate the smell receptors in your nose, which send messages directly to your brain's limbic system. The limbic system affects your emotions, memory, learning, appetite, and sex drive. Inhaling essential oils stimulates different bodily responses, such as breathing patterns, blood pressure, and heart rate. You can treat a wide variety of mental and physical problems with aromatherapy. Whether it's alleviating pain, improving focus, [improving your sense of smell](https://boomboomnaturals.com/blogs/news/how-to-improve-sense-of-smell), promoting restful sleep or aiding in digestion, there are essential oils that can help with the healing process. Aromatherapy can be used in the following ways: direct inhalation, vaporizer, humidifier, perfume, and aromatherapy diffusers. It's also important to note essential oils are powerful and need to be diluted before use. This is why they are combined with carrier oils. The most common carrier oils include avocado oil, almond oil, coconut oil, and olive oil. We know what you're thinking: \"But doesn't diluting it decrease the effectiveness?\" No. In fact, in this case, less is more. Dilution increases the surface area where the essential oil can be absorbed and as an added bonus, diluting lowers the risk of experiencing any skin sensitivity issues. The beauty of essential oils is that they typically perform more than one function, so by knowing the benefits of each you can find (or create) a personalized blend to meet your mental and physical health needs.
