It emphasizes the therapeutic relationship and makes use of all appropriate therapies, both conventional and alternative. The Principles of Integrative Medicine: - A partnership between patient and practitioner in the healing process - Appropriate use of conventional and alternative methods to facilitate the body's innate healing response - Consideration of all factors that influence health, wellness and disease, including mind, spirit and community as well as body - A philosophy that neither rejects conventional medicine nor accepts alternative therapies uncritically - Recognition that good medicine should be based in good science, be inquiry driven, and be open to new paradigms - Use of natural, effective, less-invasive interventions whenever possible - Use of the broader concepts of promotion of health and the prevention of illness as well as the treatment of disease - Training of practitioners to be models of health and healing, committed to the process of self-exploration and self-development.
