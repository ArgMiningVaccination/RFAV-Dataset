And every now and then energy detox is essential. Especially since modern-day living is weighed down with energy vampires, be it soul-sucking screens or your whingy co-worker. But what is energy and why is good juju so important in our lives, in the first place? UK-based divine connector Ankita Ghuman says, \"In plain speak, energy is a vibration, which is not limited to the physical realm. Energy exists both on the physical and metaphysical level, such as thoughts, emotions, consciousness, space-time etc.\" Negative energy is said to leave a physiological and psychological impact on us, ranging from headaches and stomachaches to stress and confusion. An energy detox cleanses your aura, the electromagnetic field that encompasses your body. \"It means purifying, cleansing, clearing and recharging your auric or energy fields,\" says Nakshi Satra, [wellness](https://www.vogue.in/wellness), a consultancy for holistic well-being. \"We need energy to cleanse especially when we are involved or engaged with energies that have a low vibrational frequency and don't align with our authentic energy,\" she explains. Getting squeaky clean Comparing an energy detox to a daily shower, Ghuman says \"An energy [detox](https://www.vogue.in/content/how-to-detox-at-home-a-guide-to-detoxing-in-2019) is when we remove the mental clutter from our mind. Our mental clutter can encompass our thought patterns and memories which no longer serve us any purpose. When there is an over-accumulation of such patterns in our life, we reach a point of stagnation and come to a standstill.\" This puts a brake on you moving ahead in your personal and professional life journey. \"One must acknowledge to oneself that to learn anything new in life one has to first unlearn. Breaking patterns is not easy. It's only when one lets go of the past negativity can one truly welcome the positivity, abundance and happiness that their surroundings have to offer.\" Pranic Healer and Co-Founder & Director of Atmantan Wellness Centre, Sharmilee Agrawal Kapur, says it's necessary to regularly cleanse the body's energy field. \"All illnesses and negative elements first enter the energy field and from there on they affect the physical body!\" Energy detoxes can be done when you are feeling heavy, congested or even if you feel unwell post a [healing](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/3-healing-protocols-that-will-improve-your-workouts-and-give-you-the-results-youre-looking-for) session, says Agrawal Kapur. Ahead, some methods to cleanse your aura and shed negative energy. - Charging water: Given that the human body is approximately 60% water, Ghuman recommends a water routine. \"Take a glass filled with water and put your intentions with full intensity in the glass. Whatever you are wishing for has to be in the continuous present tense.\" After a couple of minutes drink half the glass and drink the remainder [water](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/no-drinking-too-much-water-isnt-doing-you-any-favours-either)in the morning after waking. \"The science behind it is that we are reprogramming our mind with a singular important thought with water. These thoughts slowly start forming a new memory erasing our previous ones.\" - Draw boundaries: Protecting your energy isn't just restricted to physical practices only, but also extends to looking after your mental and emotional wellbeing. \"Let go of the unwanted, draw boundaries, and learn to say no without allowing others to push their one-sided views, opinions and expectations onto you,\" says Satra. - Take salt baths daily: Salt is essentially a crystal and a [salt bath](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/heres-how-salt-baths-help-you-cleanse-your-aura-and-negative-energy)is said to cleanse the aura, remove negative energy and rejuvenate the skin. - Inward-looking practices: Agrawal Kapur recommends meditation as an exercise in self-reflection, to gain a clearer perspective, along with breathing to release unwanted emotions and energies. \"When feeling unwell or congested, chanting and willing the feeling away is a great method of manifestation,\" she adds. When it comes to emotions, she says they need to be experienced. \"Only then when we accept, bless and release them, do they finally leave us.\" Also, the feeling of gratitude is said to help attract abundance and open you to new possibilities. - Spend time in nature and connecting with yourself: Connect with [nature](https://www.vogue.in/story/experience-luxury-and-celebration-in-the-lap-of-nature/), walk on the grass and join a laughter club. \"Even the earth, wind and sun have living Prana which heals us; thus, even walking barefoot in nature heals!\" says Agrawal Kapur. - Work with a qualified professional: \"The aim of positive well-being is a journey and it is better achieved under the guidance of a teacher or guru,\" says Ghuman. However, it is important to choose a guide who resonates with your [religious](https://www.vogue.in/content/religious-dress-design-perspective)or cultural background, to make the trek easier.
