In addition, chiropractic adjustments may stimulate and optimize nervous system function. The nervous system is the message center between the brain and the rest of the body. It communicates information to and from various organs, through nerve roots that originate from the spinal cord, branching out of the spine, and connecting to specific organs and tissues. Chiropractic adjustments to the spine would aim to relieve pain, restore motion, and optimize nervous system health. We strive to provide you excellent chiropractic care whether you have an acute or chronic condition, or desire preventative maintenance care. The Education of a Chiropractor Most patients don't realize how much education chiropractors in Temecula CA have. Chiropractors are held to some of the most intense educational standards in any health field. In fact, their education standards are very comparable to that of a medical doctor. After completing a strong emphasis of basic sciences in college, chiropractors attend a four-year chiropractic college. This means that chiropractors are primary care physicians. In other words, you don't have to have a referral to see a chiropractor. Is chiropractic the right treatment for you? Call our team at Inland Valley Integrative Health in Temecula CA.
