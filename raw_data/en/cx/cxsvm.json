The answer is yes. Acupuncture can enhance the effectiveness of IVF in many ways. And since IVF can be costly both from a financial and emotional stand point it makes sense to do acupuncture along with the IVF to give yourself the greatest chance of success. If you compare IVF to a marathon, then acupuncture would be the training you do before the marathon. If you prepare first, you will do better on the big day of the event. Acupuncture prepares the body for IVF in many ways. It affects many factors ranging from stress reduction, to hormone balance, to improved blood flow to the reproductive organs, and more. Undergoing IVF treatments can be emotionally and physically demanding, often leading to increased stress levels for couples. Acupuncture gently releases endorphins and reduces cortisol bringing down both stress and anxiety. Studies suggest that elevated stress hormones can adversely impact fertility, and acupuncture's ability to modulate these hormones contribute to a more receptive reproductive environment during IVF cycles. Effective blood circulation is crucial for the ovaries and uterus, ensuring that they receive an optimal supply of oxygen and nutrients. Acupuncture's placement of needles at specific points stimulates blood flow, thereby promoting an environment that encourages follicular development and implantation. Improved blood circulation not only aids in nourishing the reproductive organs but also helps in carrying away toxins that could impair fertility. Acupuncture also has a profound impact on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, a critical system governing the menstrual cycle and reproductive processes. By influencing this axis, acupuncture regulates hormonal fluctuations and enhances the synchronization required for successful IVF cycles. Acupuncture assists IVF by promoting the delicate harmony of hormones essential for follicular maturation and embryo implantation. And these are only some of the ways in which seeing an acupuncturist can powerfully impact IVF success. An acupuncturist looks at the whole person in front of them and addresses health issues that a person may not even be aware is affecting their fertility, such as sleep, inflammation, diet and more.
