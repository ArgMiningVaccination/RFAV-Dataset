These characteristicsposenewchallengestothedesignofearly-phaseclinicaltrials. Conventional phase I designs for chemotherapy commonly aim to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), defined as the dose level that has the toxicity probability closest to the prespecified target level. This relies on the assumptionthattoxicityandefficacyincreasemonotonicallywiththedosesuchthatameaningfultherapeutictreatment effectcanbeachievedattheMTD.However,thedose-responsemonotonicityassumptionmightnotholdforimmunother- apy and molecularly targeted agents, of which the dose-efficacy curves may take various shapes.1,2For example, the dose-efficacy curve of an immunotherapy may reach a plateau at a dose level lower than the MTD, that to the higher dose levels (ie, doses 3 and 4), while the final recommended dose level (dose 2) only treated 18% of the enrolled patients. This example shows a typical toxicity-only design flaw in finding the OBD, ofwhichtheidentificationdependsonbothtoxicityandefficacyjointlyinsteadoftoxicitysolely.Whenalldoseswere welltolerable,thetoxicity-onlydesignswouldalwaysrecommenddoseescalationwithoutconsideringthedose-efficacy relationship.SuchapracticeusuallyleadstoahigherlikelihoodtomisstheOBD,whilealsocausingmorepatientsto be treated at subtherapeutic doses. The dose-efficacy relationship, where efficacy improvement can no longerbeobservedbeyondacertaindoselevel,isoftenseenintheearly-phasetrialsoftargetedtherapies,forexample, Hornetal6andPatiletal.7 To more accurately identify the OBD, we propose an optimal biological makinganditsdoseescalation/de-escalationschemecanbefeasiblyenumeratedontoapretabulateddecisiontable.This simplifiesthedesignimplementationandtrialconduct. Various phase designs that simultaneously model toxicity and efficacy endpoints to identify the OBD have been developed in recent years. In general, depending on whether or not a parametric curve is specified for the dose-response relationship, the existing methods for phase I/II trials can be categorized into two classes: curve-baseddesignsandcurve-freedesigns.Thecurve-baseddesignspositparametricmodelstocharacterizetherelationshipbetween2628 SHIetal. thedoseandthejointtoxicityandefficacyoutcomes,andtheycanusuallyproducedesirableoperatingcharacteristics after careful calibration.3,13Braun14extended the continual reassessment method to simultaneously account for both toxicityandefficacy.ThallandCook15proposedaBayesianmodelforthebivariatetoxicityandefficacyendpointsand established priors based on efficacy-toxicity tradeoff contours (EffTox). Yin al16developed a phase I/II design that uses the efficacy/toxicity odds ratio to model the tradeoff between the two endpoints. Zang et al17introduced an iso- tonicregression-based(Iso)designtoidentifytheOBD.MozgunovandJaki18classifiedthebivariatetoxicityandefficacy outcomes into three categories and used an information theoretic approach to determine the best dose without the assumptionofmonotonicity.OtherapproachesalongthedirectionofbivariatemodelingforphaseI/IIdesignsalsohave beenproposed,suchasHoeringetal,19Riviereetal,20andLiuandJohnson.21 As an alternative to curve-based designs, curve-free designs have been proposed to simplify the use of novel adap- tivedesignsinrealtrialswhilemakingthemmorerobust.Unlikethecurve-baseddesigns,thisclassofdesignsdoesnot assumeanyparametricdose-responsecurvefordosefinding.Lietal22proposedatoxicityandefficacyprobabilityinter- val (TEPI) design that separately models the toxicity and efficacy as it adaptively assigns new patients to a points.Toincorporatethepossiblecorrelationbetweenthetoxicityandefficacyoutcomes,Zhouetal25recentlydeveloped atwo-stageutility-basedBayesianoptimalinterval(U-BOIN)designusingaMultinomial-Dirichletmodeltojointlymodeltoxicityandefficacy. Curve-freedesignsusuallyrequirelessintensivecomputationthancurve-baseddesigns,whiletheperformancesare stillcompetitive.However,thedoseselectioncriteriaofmostoftheexistingcurve-freedesignsarecenteredaroundeffi- cacy, aiming to find the most efficacious dose among all the doses with tolerable toxicities; whereas very few designs makedose-assignmentdecisionsbaseduponautilityfunctionthatexplicitlyquantifiesthetoxicity-efficacypreference. As a curve-free design, the proposed uTPI design seeks to fill this gap in research by taking into account both toxic- ity and efficacy outcomes in decision making through a defined dose desirability function from the start of the trial, instead of treating them independently. Similar to many other curve-free designs, 8,22,24,25the uTPI design has a trans- parentdecisionstructuresuchthatadose-assignmentdecisiontablecanbecalculatedaheadofthetrialstartandcanbe readily used throughout the trial.

Based on these four nonoverlapping events, a quasi-binomial distribution To balance the toxicity-efficacy tradeoffs in dose finding, we define a numerical, one-dimensional utility that charac- terizes the desirability of each of the four possible outcomes of Y. The utility function should be negatively related to toxicityandpositivelyrelatedtoefficacy.Ingeneral,anyutilityfunctionthatcanprojectthebivariatetoxicity-efficacy outcomestothe(0,1)domainissuitablefortheproposedmethod.Forillustrativepurposes,weherebydefinethenumer-icalutilitybasedonthefollowing2 \u00d72risk-benefitpreferencetable,andthisfurtherrendersthequantificationofdose w4 In general, w3[0,1] should have the maximum value among the four specified values, since the outcome ( Tc,E) is the most desirable, while w2[0,1] should be the smallest, as it indicates the worst-case scenario. For the sake of simplicity, we take w3=1a n d w2=0, that is, we assume a value of 1 for the best outcome and a value of 0 for the worst outcome. The remaining two quantities, w1andw4, should be non-negative and lie in the joint probability vector ( p1,p2,p3,p4) depends on the dose level. In other words, the expectedvalue EUcanbeusedtocharacterizethedesirabilityofthedoseatwhichthepatientistreated.Thus,weuse EU In the dose-finding of the proposed design, we use the posterior desirability distribution of EU, denoted asf(EU|D), to decide the dose level for new patients. To further simplify the computation, we treat the numeri- cal utility outcome Uas a pseudo binomial observation and use quasi-likelihood for inference.10In particular, let ui denote the observed numerical utility for patient i,i=1,...,n, and depending on the bivariate outcome of efficacy and toxicity, uican take a value from ( w1,w2,w3,w4), which are all between 0 and numerical utility preferencetable, we haven i=1ui= 4 k=1wkxk. In the special case of w1+w4=1, the posterior distribution of EUcan be further simplified as EU|D Beta(U+nEw1+(nnT)w4,U+(nnE)w1+nTw4),whichdependsonthenumberofpatients n,thenumberoftox- icity outcomes nT, and the number of efficacy outcomes nE. By default, we consider U=U=1, that is, impact on the posterior estimation, as the information is primarily dominated by the data rather identify the OBD among the given Jdose levels, we propose to jointly monitor the toxicity and in (or desirability), whichmeans that any two dose levels whose toxicity probabilities (or EU's) lying within the same toxicity (or desirability) interval are treated indifferently intermsoftoxicityorexpecteddesirability.Thereasonforspecifyingtheindifferenceintervals isthatthesamplesizeinearly-phasedose-findingtrialsistypicallysmall,andthusitisdifficulttodifferentiatethetwodoselevelsthathave similartoxicityprobabilities(or EU).Theconstructionofthetoxicity/desirabilityintervalsmimicstheideaofspecifying equally-spaced toxicity intervals in the keyboard design, 8and we extend their proposed \"keys\" in a one-dimensional keyboard(oftoxicityintervals)to\"squares\"onatwo-dimensionalchessboard(ofbothtoxicityanddesirabilityintervals), as shown in Figure 1. A similar idea of using probability interval for modeling has also been proposed in the and desirability intervals (kT j,kU j)can be treated as acceptable, while any level with j,T>0.4 is deemed as excessively toxic. As a result, TheN*isatuningparameterthatservesasaboundarybetweenanearlystagethatencouragesexploringhigherdose levels, and a late stage that is more conservative in dose expansion. When kT j=kandnjN*, that is, our estimated toxicityintervalisthesameasthatoftheMTD,itindicatesthat(basedonarelativelylargesamplesize)itishighlylikely thatthecurrentdoseisindeedtheMTD,andthathigherdoselevelswouldbeoverlytoxicaccordingtotheassumption of a monotonically increasing dose-toxicity relationship. This means that further escalation would most likely resultsin unfavorable toxicity responses in patients. Therefore, for the sake of patient safety, we would prefer a conservative escalationrulewhen that is, dose level jhas been untried, we assign an initial value j+1is n o ta sh i g ha st h a to f jorj1. To avoid such a scenario and encourage further dose exploration to the untried levels, anadditionaldoseexplorationrulethatpushesthedosetothenexthigherlevelwhenthetrialmightbetrappedatthe current dose can be adopted. Evaluation of the operating characteristics of this optional dose exploration rule can be foundinSectionS.2oftheSupplementaryMaterial.Insummary,theinitialvalueof kU jforuntrieddosestogetherwith theadditionaldoseexplorationrulecontroltheaggressivenessofthedoseexploration.Formostoncologytrialswhere theresponseratesarerelativelylow,thedefaultsettingoftheuTPIwithouttheadditionalexplorationrulecanleadto satisfactoryoperatingcharacteristics.Insomecasessuchassomevaccinetrialswheretheresponseratesareparticularly high,itismoredesirabletoassignahigherinitialvaluetotheuntrieddosesorimposetheadditionaldoseexploration dose-finding rule of the proposed uTPI design depends on the locations of the strongest toxicity responding dose escalation/de-escalation decision.

For the purpose of a fair comparison of the correct selection percentage, we adjust and calibrate the other three designs such that they also have the same desirability functions as our design in the final selection of the optimal dose. As a result, a change in the preference structure ( w1,w4) would result in different correct selection percentagesofthethreeotherdesigns.Ontheotherhand,thepatientallocationdistributionsofIsoandTEPIremain structurewouldleadtoidenticalpatientallocation.Incontrast,boththeEffToxanduTPIdesignsaremoreflexibleandcanincorporatedifferentpreferencestructuresfordecisionmaking,andthusdifferentpatientallocationvaluesareobserved.

An additional simulation study reported in the Supplementary Mate- rial shows that the developed time-to-event uTPI (TITE-uTPI) design still can yield satisfactory operating charac- teristics across various scenarios. Compared to the standard uTPI design that requires repeated suspension of the patient accrual before assigning the next dose level for each new patient cohort, the TITE-uTPI design significantly shortens the trial duration due to the ability to make real-time decisions, and thus it is able to accelerate drug issue ofdelayedresponses.The RcodetoimplementtheuTPIdesigncanbeobtainedfromhttps://github.com/haoluns/uTPI.
