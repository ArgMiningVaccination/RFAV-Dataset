It starts with an itchy nose, followed by a blocked nose and then fever. Many people are quick to reach for maximum strength medications and ask their doctors to prescribe antibiotics. However, it's much more important to first determine what's at the root of the illness. Is it a viral or bacterial infection? As a rule of thumb: DR. HANS MICHAEL STRAHL: \"A viral infection usually manifests itself quickly. In severe cases of the flu, temperatures often seem to skyrocket, whereas bacterial infections tend to creep up on you.\" NARRATOR: The common cold is more often than not a viral infection transmitted by direct contact like shaking hands. And antibiotics are of no help in cases like these. You only need to look at the root of the word antibiotics to understand how they work. Anti means against and bios means life. So antibiotics are only effective in combating pathogens with a metabolism. And that only applies to bacteria. STRAHL: \"Antibiotics fight bacteria in one of two ways. Either they inhibit them from growing or they kill them. And the mechanisms for doing this are distinct, making it dangerous to combine different antibiotics.\" NARRATOR: And stopping intake too soon can also present problems. Many patients tend to take them when the symptoms are strong, only to stop once they feel better - a mistake. STRAHL: \"When antibiotics are taken as prescribed, the desired effect kicks in relatively quickly and the patient gets the feeling that he or she is doing better and doesn't need to take antibiotics anymore. Not so. As a rule of thumb, antibiotics must be taken for a minimum of five days. But be sure to ask your doctor how long he or she thinks you should take them.\" NARRATOR: To stop colds before they start, doctors recommend performing regular nasal irrigation and drinking tomato juice. STRAHL: \"As it turns out, the tomato juice sold in run-of-the-mill drinks cartons - I mean the regular cheap stuff - contains the nutrient lycopene. And this red pigment increases the mucus membrane's resistance by 50 percent. It really makes a lot of sense to drink a glass of tomato juice every day - especially in the winter.\" NARRATOR: The golden rule of maintaining a strong immune system is to get plenty of exercise and fresh air. Should you still catch a cold, however, many doctors recommend taking a warm foot bath. Doing so raises the temperature of the mucus membranes and sinuses by two degrees, thereby increasing your ability to fight off the disease by 50 percent. It's simple advice to help us see out the winter without too many of the chills. DR. HANS MICHAEL STRAHL: \"A viral infection usually manifests itself quickly.
