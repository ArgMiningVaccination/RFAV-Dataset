F ULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION 1 INDIC ATIO NS AND USAGE REC OMBIVAX HB\u00ae [Hepatitis B Vaccine, Recombinant] is indicated for preventi on of infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus. RECOMBIVAX HB is approved for use in individ uals of all ages. RECOMBIVAX HB Dialysis Formulation is approved for use in adult predialysis and dialysis patients 18 year s of age and older .22 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intramuscular administration. See Section 2.2 for subcutaneous administra tion with hemophilia. RECOMBIVAX HB should be admi nistered as soon as possible after being removed from refrigeration [s ee How Supplied/Storag e and Handling (16)]. 2.1 Dosage and Schedule RECOMBIVAX HB : Persons from bi rth through 19 years of ag e: A series of 3 doses (0.5 mL each) given on a 0 -, 1-, and 6-month schedule. Adolescents 11 through 15 years of age: A series of 3 doses (0.5 mL each) given on a 0-, 1-, and 6- month schedule or a series of 2 doses (1.0 mL each) on a 0- and 4- to 6-month sche dule. Persons 20 years of age and older: A series of 3 do ses (1.0 mL each) gi ven on a 0-, 1-, and 6 -month schedule. RECOMBIVAX HB Dialysis Formulatio n: Adults on predialysis and dialysis: A series of 3 doses (1.0 mL each) given on a 0-, 1-, and 6-mont h schedule. Table 1 summarizes the dose and formulation of RECOMBIVAX HB for specific populations, regardless of the risk of infec tion with hepatitis B virus. Table 1: RECOMBIVAX HB Recommended Dose and Administration Schedules Group Dose/Regimen Inf ants*, Chil d ren and Adolescents 0- 19 of age (Pediatric/ Adol escent Formulati on) 5 mcg (0.5 mL) 3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months Adolescents 11 thr ough 15 years of age (Adult F ormulation) 10 mcg (1.0 mL) 2 doses at 0 and 4 -6 months Adults 20 years of age (Adult F ormulation) 10 mcg (1.0 mL) 3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months Predialysis and Dialysis Patients \u00a7 (Dialysis F ormulation) 40 mcg (1.0 mL) 3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months * For specific recommendations for infant s s ee ACIP recomme nd ations.{1} Adolescents (11 through 15 years of age) may receive either regimen: 3 x 5 mcg (Pediatric Formulation) or 2 x 10 mcg (Adult Formulation). If the suggested dose (10 mcg) is not available, the appropri ate dosage can be ach ieved with two 5 mcg doses. However, the Dialysis Formulation may be used only for adult predialysis/dialysis patients . \u00a7 See also recommendations for revaccination of predialysis and dialysis patients in [Dosage and Administration (2.4 )]. 2.2 Preparatio n and Administrati on Shake the single -dose vial or single -dose prefilled syringe well to obtain a slightly opaque, white suspension before withdrawal and use. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administrat ion, whenever solution and container permit. Discard if the suspension does not appear homogeneous or if extraneous particulate matter remains or if discoloration is observed. For single -dose vials, withdraw and administer entire dose of RECOMBIVAX HB intramuscularly using a sterile needle and syringe. Discard vial after use. For single -dose prefilled syringes, securely attach a needle by twisting in a clockwise direction and administer dose of RECOMBIVAX HB intramuscularly. Discard syring e after use. The deltoid muscle is the preferr ed site for intramuscular injection for adults, adolescents and children 1 year of age and older whose deltoid is large enough for intramuscular injection. The anterolateral aspect of the thigh is the preferred site for intramu scular injection for infants younger than 13year of age . RECOMBIVAX HB should not be administered in the gluteal region, as i njections given in the buttocks have resulted in lower ser oconversion rates than expected .{2} RECOMBIVAX HB may be administered subcutaneously to persons at risk for hemorrhage following intramuscular injections (e.g., hemophiliacs) . However, hepatitis B vaccines are known to result in lower antibody response when administered subcutaneously.{3} Additionally, when other aluminum -adso rbed vaccines have been admin istered subcutaneously, an increased incidence of local reactions including subcutaneous nodules has been observed. Therefore, consider subcutaneous administration only in persons who are at risk of hemorrhage following intramu sc ular injections or intradermally . 2.3 Known or Pr esu med Exposure to Hepatitis B Virus Known or Presumed Exposure to HBsAg Refer to recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and to the package insert for hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) for management of persons with known or presumed exposure to the hepatitis B virus (e.g., neonates born of infected mothers or persons who experienced percutaneous or permucosal exposure to the virus) . When recommended, administer RECOMBIVAX HB and HBIG intramuscularly at sepa rate sites (e.g., opposite anterolateral thighs for exposed neonates) as soon as possible after exposure. Administer a dditional doses of RECOMBIVAX HB (to complete a vaccination serie s) in accordance with ACIP recommendations . 2.4 Booster Vaccinations The duration of the protective effect of RECOMBIVAX HB in healthy vaccinees is unknown at present and the need for booster doses is not yet defined . The ACIP provides recommendations for use of a booster dose or revaccination series in previously vaccinated individuals with known or presumed exposure to Hepatitis B Virus. Consider a booster dose or revaccination with RECOMBIVAX HB Dialysis Formulation (blue color code) in predialysis/dia ly sis patients if the anti - HBs level is less than 10 mIU/mL at 1 to 2 mon ths after the third dose. Assess the need for a booster dose annually by antibody testing , and give a booster dose when the anti -HBs level decline s to less than 10 mIU/mL. {3} 3 DOSAGE F ORMS AND STRENGTHS RECOMBIVAX HB is a sterile suspension available in t he following presentations: 0.5 mL ( 5 mcg ) Pediatric /Adolescent Formulation single -dose vial syringe s 1 mL ( 10 mcg ) Adult and prefilled s yringes RECOMBIVAX HB DIALYSIS FORMULATION is a sterile suspension availa ble in the following presentation: 1 mL ( 40 mcg ) single -dose vial [s ee Description (11) and How Suppl i ed/Storage and Handling (16)] 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not administer RECOMBI VAX HB to individuals with a history of severe allergic or hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any hepatitis B-containing vaccine or to any component of RECOMBIVAX HB, including yeast [see Description (11)] . 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypersensitivity to Latex The vial stopper and the syring e plunger stopper and tip cap contain dry natural latex rubber , which may cause allergic reactions in latex - sensitive individuals . 5.2 Apnea in Premature Infants Apnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born prematurely . Decisions about when to administer an intramusc ular vaccine, including RECOMBIVAX HB, to infants born prematurely should be based on consideration of the individual infant's medical status and the potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination. For RECOMBIVAX HB, this assessment should include consideration of the mother's hepatitis B antigen status and the high probability of maternal4 transmission of hepatitis B virus to infan ts born to mothers who are HBsAg positive if vaccination is delayed. 5.3 Infants Weig hin g Less Than 2000 g Hepatitis B vaccination should be delayed until 1 month of age or hospital discharge in infants weighing <2000 g if the mother is documented to be HBsAg negative at the time of the infant's birth. Infants weighing <2000 g born to HBsA g p ositive or HBsAg unknown mothers should receive vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) in accordance with ACIP recommendations if HBsAg status cannot be determ ined{3} [s ee Dosage and Administration (2)]. 5.4 Prevention and Managemen t of Allergic Va ccine Reactions Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration [se e Contraindicatio ns (4)]. 5.5 Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness Hepatitis B virus has a long incubat ion period. RECOMBIVAX HB may not prevent hepatitis B infection in individuals who have an unrecognized hepatitis B infection at the time of vaccination. Additionally , vacc ination with RECOMBIVAX HB may not protect all individuals . 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS In healthy infants and children (up to 10 years of age), the most frequently reported systemic adverse reactions (>1% injections), in decreasing order of frequency, were irritability, fever, diarrhea, fatigue/weakness, dim i nished appetite, and r hinitis. In heal thy adults, injection site reactions and systemic adverse reactions were reported following 17% and 15% of the injections, respectively. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse react ion rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may no t reflect the rates observ ed in practice. In three clinical studies, 434 doses of RECOMBIVAX HB, 5 mcg, were administered to 147 healthy infants and children (up to 10 years of age) who were monitored for 5 days after each dose. Injection site reactions and systemic adverse react ions were reported following 0.2% and 10.4% of the injections, respective ly. The most frequently reported systemic adverse reactions (>1% injections), in decreasing order of frequency, were irritability, fever ( 101\u00b0F oral equivalent), diarrhea, fatigue/we akness, diminished appetite, and rhinitis . In a study that compared the three-dose regimen (5 mcg) with the two-dose regimen (10 mcg) of RECOMBIVAX HB in adolescents, the overall frequency of adverse reactions was generally similar. In a group of studies, 3258 doses of RECOMBIVAX HB, 10 mcg, were administered to 1252 healthy adults who were monitored for 5 days after each dose. Injection site reactions and systemic adverse reactions were reported following 17% and 15% of the injections, respectively. The following adverse reactions were reported: Incidence Equal To or Greater Th an 1% of Inje ctions GENERAL DISORDERS AND ADMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS Injection site reactions consisting principally of soreness, and including pain, tenderness, pruritus, erythe ma , ecchymosis, swelling, warmth, nodule formation. sys complai nts include fatigue/weakness; headache; fever upper respiratory infection Incid ence Less Than 1% of Injections GENERAL DISORDERS AND A DMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS Sweating; achiness; sensation THORACIC AND MEDIASTINAL Rhinitis; i nfluenza; cough NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS Vertigo/dizziness; paresthesia5 SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS DISORDERS back pain; neck pain; shoulder pain; neck stiffness BLOOD AND LYMPHATIC DISORDERS Lymphadenopathy PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS Insomnia/disturbed sleep EAR AND LABYRINTH DISORDERS Earache RENAL AND URINARY DISORDERS Dysuria CARDIAC DISORDERS Hypotension 6.2 Post- Marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with use of the marketed vaccine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequ ency or establish a causal relationship to a vaccine exposure. Immune System Disorders Hy persensitivity reactions including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, bronchospasm, and urticaria have been reported within the first few hours after vaccination. An apparent hypersensitivity syndrome (serum -sickness -like) of delayed onset has been reported days to weeks after vaccination, including: arthralgia/arthritis (usually transient), fever, and dermatologic reported. Gastrointestinal Disorders Elevation of liver enzymes; constipation Nervous System Disorders -Barr\u00e9 Arthritis and Lymphatic System Disorders Cardiac Disorders Syncope; ta chycardi a The following adverse reaction has been reported with another Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant) but not with RECOMBIVAX HB: keratitis. 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Concomitant Administration w ith Other Vaccines Do not mix RECOMBIVAX HB with any other vaccine in the same syringe or vial. Use separate injection sites and syringes for each vaccine. In cl inical trials in children, RECOMBIVAX HB was concomitantly administered with one o r more of the following US licensed vaccines: Diphtheria, Tetanus and whole cell Pertussis ; oral Poliomyelitis vaccine ;6Measles, Mumps, and Vaccine (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate)] or a booster dose of Diphtheria, Tetanus, acellular Pertussis . Safety and immunogenicity were similar for concomitantly administered vaccines compared to separately administered vaccines. In another clinical trial, a related HBsAg - containing product, Haemophilus b Conjugate (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate) and Hepatitis B (Recombinant) combination product (no longer licensed ), was given concomitantly with eIPV (enhanced inactivated Poliovirus vaccine) or VARIVAX \u00ae [Varicella Virus Live (Oka/Merck)], using separate sites and syringes for injectable vaccines. No serious vaccine -related adverse events were reported , and no impairment of immune response to these individually tested vaccine antigens was demonstrated. The Haemophilus b Conjugate (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate) and Hepatitis B (Recombinant) combination product (no longer licensed ) has also been administered concomitantly with the primary series of DTaP to a limited number of infants. No serious vaccine - related adverse events were reported. 7.2 Concomitant Administration with Immune Globulin RECOMBIVAX HB may be administered concomita ntly with HBIG. The first dose of RECOMBIVAX HB may be given at the same time as HBIG, but the injections should be administered at different sites. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) derived from hepatitis B vaccine s has been transiently detected in blood samples following vaccination. Serum HBsAg detection may not have diagnostic value within 28 days after receipt of a hepatitis B vaccine, including RECOMBIVAX HB. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Sum mary All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4%, and 15% to 20%, respecti vely. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies designed to evaluate RECOMBIVAX HB in pregnant women. Available post-approval data do not suggest an increased risk of miscarriage or major birth defects in women who received RECOMBIVAX HB during pre gnancy . Developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with the vaccine in animals. Data Human Data In post-licensure clinical studies of RECOMBIVAX HB, 26 pregnant women were inadvertently administered RECOMBIVAX HB following their last menstrual period. Among these pregnancies, after excluding elective terminations (n=3), there were 23 pregnancies with known outcomes all with exposure in the first trimester. Miscarriage was reported in 4 of 23 (17%) pregnancies and major birth defects were reporte d in 0 of 19 (0%) live births. The rates of miscarriage and major birth defects were consistent with estimated background rates. Post-approval adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size. It is not always possible to reli ably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the vaccine. In prospectively reported spontaneous post-approval reports from 1986 to 2018 , 105 women with known pregnancy outcomes were exposed to RECOMBIVAX HB during pregnancy followin g the last menstrual period. After excluding induced abortions (n=5) , those with exposure in the third trimester (n=4), and those with an unknown exposure timing (n=6), there were 90 pregnancies with known outcomes with exposures in the first or second trimester. Miscarriage was reported for 7 of 90 (7.8%) pregnancies. Major birth defects were reported for 2 of 83 (2.4%) live born infants. The rates of miscarriage and major birth defects were consistent with estimated background rates. 8.2 Lactation Risk Su mmary It is not known whether RECOMBIVAX HB is excreted in human milk. Data are not available to assess the effects of RECOMBIVAX HB on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be c onsidered along with the mother's clinical need for RECOMBIVAX HB and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from7RECOMBIVAX HB or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptib ility to the disease prevented by the vaccine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of RECOMBIVAX HB have been established in all pediatric age groups. Maternally transferred antibodies do not interfere with the active immune response to the vaccine . [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1 and 14.2).] The safety and effectiveness of RECOMBIVAX HB Dialysis Formulation in children have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of RECOMBIVAX HB used for licensure did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, in later studies it has been shown that a diminished antibody response can be expected in persons older than 60 ye ars of age. 11 DESCRIPTION RECOMBIVAX HB Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant) is a sterile suspension of non- infectious subunit viral vaccine derived from HBsAg produced in yeast cells. A portion of the hepatitis B virus gene, coding for HBsAg, is cloned into yeast, and the vaccine for hepatitis B is produced from cultures of this recombinant yeast strain according to methods developed in the Research Laboratories of Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ, USA . The antigen is harvested and purified from fermentat ion cultures of a recombinant strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing the gene for the adw subtype of HBsAg. The fermentation process involves growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on a complex fermentation medium which consists of an extract of yeast, soy peptone, dextrose, amino acids and mineral salts. The HBsAg protein is released from the yeast cells by cell disruption and purified by a series of physical and chemical methods. The purified protein is treated in phosphate buffer with formal dehyde and then coprecipitated with alum (potassium aluminum sulfate) to form bulk vaccine adjuvanted with amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate. Each dose contains less than 1% yeast protein. The vaccine produced by the Merck Sharp & Do hme LLC, Rahw ay, NJ, USA method ha s been shown to be comparable to the plasma - derived vaccine in terms of animal potency (mouse, monkey, and chimpanzee) and protective efficacy (chimpanzee and human). The vaccine against hepatitis B, prepared from recomb inant yeast cultures, is free of association with human blood or blood products. RECOMBI VAX HB Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant) is supplied in three formulations. [See How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16).] Pediatric/Adolescent Formulation (Without Pres ervative), 10 mcg/mL: each 0.5 mL dose contains 5 mcg of hepatitis B surface antigen. Adult Formulation (Without Preservative), 10 mcg/mL: each 1 mL dose contains 10 mcg of hepatitis B surface antigen. Dialysis Formulation (Without Preservative), 40 mcg/mL : each 1 mL dose contains 40 mcg of hepatitis B surface antigen. All formulations contai n approximately 0.5 mg of aluminum (provided as amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate, previously referred to as aluminum hydroxide) per mL of vaccine. In each formulation, hepa titis B surface antigen is adsorbed onto approximately 0.5 mg of aluminum (provided as amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate) per mL of vaccine. The vaccine contains <15 mcg/mL residual formaldehyde. The vaccine is of the adw subtype. 12 CLINICAL PH ARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action RECOMBIVAX HB has been shown to elici t antibodies to h epatitis B virus as measured by ELISA. Antibody concentrations 10mIU/mL against HBsA g are recognized as conferring protection against hepatitis B inf ection.{2} Infection with hepatitis B virus can have serious consequences including acute massive hepatic necrosis and chronic active hepatitis. Chronically infected persons are at increased risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. 813 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility RECOMBIVAX HB has not been evaluated for its carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or its potential to impair fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8)]. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Efficacy in Neon ates with Peripartum Exposure to Hepatitis B The protective efficacy of three 5 mcg doses of RECOMBIVAX HB has been demonstrated in neonates born of mothers positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg (a core-associated antigenic complex which correla tes with high infectivity). In a clinical study of infants who received one dose of HBIG at birth followed by the recommended three -dose regimen of RECOMBIVAX HB, chronic infection had not occurred in 96% of 130 infants after nine months of follow -up.{4} The estimated efficacy in prevention of chronic hepatitis B infection was 95% as compared to the infection rate in untreated historical controls .{5} Significantly fewer neonates became chronically infected when given one dose of HBIG at birth followed by th e recommended t hree- dose regimen of RECOMBIVAX HB when compared to historical controls w ho received only a single dose of HBIG .{6} As demonstrated in the above study , HBIG, when administered simultaneously with RECOMBIVAX HB at separate body sites, did not interfere with the induction of protective antibodies against hepatitis B virus elicite d by the vaccine .{6} 14.2 Immunogenicity of a Three - Dose Regimen in Healthy Infants, Children, and Adole scents Three 5 mcg doses of RECOMBIVAX HB induced a protective l evel of antibod y in 100% of 92 infants, 99% of 129 children, and in 99% of 112 adolescen ts [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 14.3 Immunogenicity of a Two - Dose Regimen in Healthy Adolescents 11 through 15 Years of Age For adolescents (11 through 15 yea rs of age), the immunogenicity of a two - dose regimen (10 mcg at 0 and 4-6 months) was compared with that of the standard three -dose regimen (5 mcg at 0, 1, and 6 months) in an open, randomized, multicenter study. The proportion of adolescents receiving the two-dose regim en who developed a protective level of antibody one month after the last dose (99% of 255 subjects) appears similar to that among adolescents who received the three -dose regimen (98% of 121 subjects). After adolescents (11 through 15 years of age) received the first 10-mcg dose of the two-dose regimen, the proportion who develo ped a protective level of antibody was approximately 72%. 14.4 Immunogenicity in Healthy Adults Clinical studies have shown that RECOMBIVAX HB when injected into the deltoid muscle induced protective levels of antibody in 96% of 1213 healthy adults who received the recommended three -dose regimen. Antibody responses varied with age; a protective level of antibody was induced in 98% of 787 young adults 20-29 years of age, 94% of 249 adults 30-39 years of age and in 89% of 177 adults 40 years of age . 14.5 Efficacy and Immunogenicity in Specific Populations Chronic Hepatitis C Infectio n In one published study, the seroprotection rates in individuals with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection given the standard regimen of RECO MBIVAX HB was approximately 70%.{7 } In a second published study of intravenous drug users given an accelerated schedule of RECOMBIVAX HB, infection with HCV did not affect t he response to RECOMBIVAX HB.{8} Predial ysis and Dialysis Adult Patients Predialysi s and dialysis adult patients respond less well to hepatitis B vaccines than do healthy individuals; however, vaccination of adult patients early in the course of their renal disease produces higher seroconversion rates than vaccination after dialysis has been initiated.{9 } In addition, the responses to these vaccines may be lower if the vaccine is administered as a buttock injection. When 40 mcg of Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant), was administered in the deltoid muscle, 89% of 28 participants developed anti-HBs with 86% achieving levels 10 mIU/mL. However, when the same dosage of this vaccine was administered inappropriately either in the buttock or a combination of buttock and deltoid, 62% of 47 participants developed anti - HBs with 55% achieving levels of 10 mIU/mL. 15 REFERENCES 1.
