Having treatment lots of cases with ADD and ADHD, I would safely say that these disorders are a product of our eating habits and what is added into our diets knowingly or unknowingly. Majority of the times, I have found that kids who are ingesting large amounts of refined or processed foods are more likely to have either ADD or ADHD. Why? Majority of the refined and processed foods have various types of colors and additives / preservatives added to them which make them tastier and more colorful but do little in terms of nutrient availability to the consumer's body. Most refined and processed foods that are high in sugar such as cookies, cakes, candies, pastries, etc. tend to excite the neurons, and cause an increase in the firing of the electrical impulses sent by these neurons, causing a sudden rush in body, which will usually translate in hyperactivity in the child's behavior, and quite often aggression in the behavior.

Essential fatty acids are crucial for the brain development, hence very important to supplement if they are lacking. Testing is available to see if there is a lack of essential fatty acids in the body. Various minerals, vitamins and nutrients that are found abundantly in fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables are very important for the body's various processes and actions, especially minerals like calcium and magnesium and certain B vitamins, a lack of which can cause symptoms such as tics and hyperactivity, along with restless behaviors. It is important to [talk to your naturopathic doctor](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/naturopathic-medicine/your-first-naturopathic-visit.html) to get a proper diagnosis of what may be lacking in your child's diet before supplementing with any supplements or vitamins.
