Why over 6,000 people love ECB I have tried several at home meal delivery services. Eat Clean Bro is the undisputed heavyweight champion. The meals just inspire confidence. The food is freakin' delicious. Better than most restaurant-made Chicken Parms and way healthier! The most amazing healthy food. The taste of the food is delicious. Delivery is always on time. You have a lot of food options to choose from the menu. I recommend this place to everyone! I truly cannot say enough good about them! From the speedy delivery to the delicious food and amazing pricing, there is no meal prep service out there that compares to these guys. Eat Clean Bro is amazing! The food is always fresh and delicious. There is a huge variety of meals to choose from so I never get tired of the selection. There's a reason this company has 5 stars... their food is fresh, affordable and delicious!! I've tried a lot of meal prep companies, and these guys definitely rise to the top. This is the only meal service you'll need to surpass your goals. The meals are great and are so well balanced, you don't ever realize you're eating clean(bro). The best healthy quality food!!! I enjoy eating from Eat Clean Bro since they give me the most options of choices of my prep meals. They also deliver 4x per week. Love the healthy and fresh delivered meals and the wide variety of options they offer. I buy extra each week for the entire family. They make a great after school snack and perfect for when everyone is on the go. The convenience of having a healthy, delicious meal waiting for me when I get home from a long day is priceless. The fact that the macros are calculated, the portions are satiating, and the variety is substantial -- particularly with their rotating specials. Get shredded and be healthy yeah I'm in! This place has quickly become my favorite! First customer service is great; super friendly and knowledgeable. I just asked for a quick meal inside no description other than telling them a bodybuilding meal low fat boom!! ECB is in a class of its own. Their food is good enough, with portions large enough, that I'm almost suspicious of the stated macros. Customer Service: TOP NOTCH! Food: Fresh and tastes so good! Convenient: Packed and just ready for you to heat up quick! I can't wait to taste more of their food! Our meals are fresh and packed well every time. We have never had a delay either. They have been a life saver during this whole pandemic as well. We have recommended to over 20 friends. All the meals are restaurant quality and extremely fresh. The portions are plentiful. Very filling depending on the meal. The specials are very creative. And the menu items I've been ordering from day one are delicious Food is fresh, not like others I have tried. No frozen vegetables. Meat isn't rubbery. Chicken tender and juicy. Ground products aren't dry. Lots of flavor and the portion are great. Amazing quality. Not to mention, the meals came in a day (decided last minute to order prepared foods for the week) when all companies in my area require deadlines to submit meal prep order. The meals make a perfect quick mindless lunch or dinner that allow me to stay accountable to my eating goals. Eat Clean Burger with sweet potato and spinach is my go-to. 20 outstanding meals delivered every week without any problems. These folks are true professionals and run an exceptional business. These meals have made my lunches and dinners healthy, quick and delicious. My biggest dilemma is that it is hard to try new meals because I liked the meals I already ordered so much. The delivery is quick and I love that they text you with the updates of your delivery and then send you a picture once they drop it off. Sometimes I don't have the time to prep my food on the weekends so Eat Clean Bro is my go to in that case. I would highly recommend them to anyone! Their customer service is top notch. I love the ease of the food pick up, you don't even have to step foot out of your car. Best and easiest way to meal prep. Working 6 days a week i found myself eating out a lot. Not only is eat clean bro a healthier option but I'm also saving a bit of money and the food is always great.
