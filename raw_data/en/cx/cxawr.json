If you're not an early bird, sleep in and join us at 10 for the keynote panel, but if you want to get things kicked off right away, this is a chance to talk about hot topics in the autism community and start getting to know other people at the Summit. 1. The Problems with Transition from School to Adulthood Led by Daren Howard This session will be a workgroup style: Daren will have questions and prompts to get you thinking, and the group will work together to brainstorm the ways that we see transition is not currently working and how we wish it would work better. Topics we may discuss include respecting the autonomy and intelligence of our kids even when they're young, what supports are missing and which are currently in place, as well as the special education to guardianship pipeline. AuSM will be inviting representatives from the MN Department of Education to listen in on the discussion. 2. Aging and Autism Led by Beth Pitchford Are you getting older and looking for resources, information, and experiences of other older adults with autism? This discussion group will talk about what information is out there, allow people time to share their personal experiences, and discuss the unique challenges of getting older while autistic. 3. Autism and Intersectionality Led by Dr. Anila Khan and Nemeh Al-Sarraj Autism can affect anyone, regardless of gender, ethnicity, race, religion, age, or any other demographic. This discussion will talk about how those intersections can affect what it's like to be autistic. Join us to talk about the unique challenges you experience in your intersections. We'll talk about underdiagnosis, racism, internalized ableism, different cultural conceptions of autism, and more! 4. Get to Know Each Other in the Hangout Room In addition to a Quiet Space, this year's Autistic Community Summit will also have a room where attendees can hang out and socialize. We'll have activities throughout the day, but you're also welcome to simply come and chat. For the first hour of the day, we'll be posting questions like \"What brings you pride in your autism?\" and inviting you to share your answers. 10 a.m.-11 a.m. Keynote Panel: Building Inclusive Autistic Communities and Relationships That Survive Conflict Panelists: Aja Wolfe, Rat Zahav, additional panelists coming soon As the Minnesota autism community has grown and aged, many autistics have found that even within groups of other neurodivergent people, we still struggle to maintain our relationships and communities. This panel will include a variety of community members who have insights on why we struggle to stay resilient in our relationships. We'll discuss methods for conflict resolution that don't end in broken friendships and splintered communities, strategies to be more inclusive and avoid cliques, and ground ourselves in the strengths that our community has as autistics. 11:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. Breakout Sessions 1 1. What Is Neurodivergent Affirming Support? presented by Michelle Swerin (30 minute presentation - 12-12:30 p.m.) Neurodivergent affirming support sounds simple and straightforward in theory, but in practice it can be overwhelming and confusing. Together we will discuss the basics of what neurodivergent affirming support is. In addition we will discuss and practice simple strategies for home, school, and work. We will wrap up our time by discussing advocacy and steps to obtain affirming support and care, and why it is so important.

Using Anger for Good - Unlocking Mindful Awareness to Live Your Best Life presented by Aja Wolfe Why do things piss you off so much? Are you often irritated or annoyed? Do your relationships end with hurt and rage? If even one of these statements is true, chances are your needs aren't getting met. As Autistics, we're taught to ignore minor frustrations. This has lasting impact on our ability to identify problems as they arise. The result? Anger. In this session, you'll learn how to use anger to gain insight into your true needs.

Research on Autism, Driven by Autistic Researchers (RADAR) presented by Isabelle Morris and Jesica Sykes This session will discuss a participatory research project called Research on Autism, Driven by Autistic Researchers (RADAR) and will be broken into three sections. The first section will cover an introduction to research, the process of creating RADAR, and involving autistic people in the research process. We will then present the results of RADAR's research\u2014a study of autistic adults' experiences and perceptions of stimming. Finally, we invite the audience to participate in an extended discussion of the information presented, including asking for audience feedback/suggestions for improving autistic access as meaningful drivers of research. Isabelle Morris is an autistic, multiply-disabled PhD student studying developmental psychology. She has been described by others as possessing \"an uncanny canine knowledge and a dry sense of humor.\" Receiving her diagnosis at age 19 changed her life for the better and focused her academic interests. Her current research looks at autistic experiences of stimming. Isabelle is passionate about creating opportunities for more autistic individuals to be involved with research and created RADAR, a participatory research project, to do just that. She lovingly refers to RADAR as \"autistic social club where we happen to talk about research.\" Jesica Sykes is a late-diagnosed autistic - ADHD PhD student studying autistic and neurodivergent communication/language abilities with a minor in developmental psychology.

The Right to Work: Navigating Discrimination (30 minute presentation - 1:30-2 p.m.) presented by Melanie Capra After high school, Melanie had zero supports upon entering the workforce. IEP's did not exist. Quiet rooms were nowhere to be found. She was left with the question \"Do I share my disability or not?\" By law, businesses cannot discriminate against workers with disabilities. However navigating the social structure of a workplace is overwhelming and there are still many instances of ableism in the workplace. In 2019, Melanie filed an EEOC complaint against her employer that drastically changed her personal and professional life. Join her to learn to recognize discrimination, what is and isn't legal, learn about workplace supports, as well as what to do if you've been discriminated against. Melanie Capra is a neurodivergent mother of two and lifelong Minnesotan. She grew up undiagnosed and found her diagnoses at age 32. She is a graduate of Bemidji State University, as well as a passionate advocate on supporting people with mental health concerns, advocating for disability rights, and promoting workplace supports. 4. What I Learned From My So-Called Career (30 minute presentation - 2-2:30 p.m.) presented by Kate Shields This session will explore Kate's career trajectory, and how the experience of trying to create a career while autistic can be challenging. Kate will share encouragement for participants to hang in there and ways to approach tasks and jobs in alternate ways. Kate Shields was diagnosed at age 61: not long before she retired. Her career path may not seem \"successful.\" It took her from librarian to chemical engineer and back, with miscellaneous other jobs. In the process, she learned to adjust and change, moving from surviving to thriving. 5. Powerpoint Party in the Hangout Room We're bringing back the Powerpoint Party!

You don't have to present to attend: you can always come to listen and learn about people's favorite interests. 3-4 p.m. Breakout Sessions 3 1. Breaking Down Our Internalized Ableism and Building Our Disability Pride presented by Milena Bates Ableism is impossible to escape. It is intrinsic and also inextricable from other societal evils. Rooting out internalized ableism is continuous work. We are not terrible gardeners if we have weeds because weeding is continuous work. I will make distinctions between what is and what is not internalized ableism, ex: lamenting our decreased productivity vs. recognizing our objective limitations. Then we will talk about ways we can build our disability pride, through media, people we spend time with, intentional actions we can take, and walk away with a list of such tools. This will be an interactive session. Milena Bates is a disability advocate on personal, family and community levels. Some of her top interests are intersectionality, assistive technology, Universal Design, and educating to expand understanding of accessibility. She is a cofounder of Minnesota Autistic Alliance, 2021/22 LEND fellow, class 40 of Partners in Policymaking, and has multiple different community organizing roles.

Listening Session: Guardianship Issues and Alternatives moderated by Eric Ringgenberg When an autistic individual who has high support needs turns 18, it's common for parents/caregivers to pursue guardianship as a method to support their young adult. However as many of these folks are getting older, they're sharing their experiences with the problems of guardianship. In this session, we invite you to share your experiences, thoughts, and opinions about guardianship as well as alternatives. We'll open with a short informational session about what guardianship is and current statistics, then open the floor for participants to share their concerns about guardianship and what they see as more positive alternatives. AuSM will be inviting representatives from local disability law organizations to listen to the discussion. "}
