Hepatitis unlike HIV can live on the outside surface of the skin for a long period of time. There are three types of hepatitis which are hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Hepatitis B is the hardest to kill on the surface. Make sure to disinfect all surfaces with a hospital grade disinfectant. (sounds plagerised) * Inaccuracy of tests especially for African infants. Treatment is varied. There are several drugs used to treat hepatitis in the United States. Intron A, Epivir-HBV, Pegasys, Baraclude, Hepsera, Viread, and Tyzeka are the only FDA approved drugs that have been shown to slow the virus and decrease liver damage and in some cases the virus is killed completely (\"Hepatitis Treatments,\" n.d.). Ultimately vaccination is the best way to prevent HBV. The vaccine has been found to be effective and safe. Administration is given over a 6 month time and consists of 3-4 shots (\"Hepatitis B,\" n.d.) and is estimated to be 95% effective. Everyone should be vaccinated but the ible underlying causes of the condition. Identify the potential health problems to the patient associated with a finding of hyperlipidaemia. Additionally, briefly list the blood tests used in the diagnosis of hyperlipidaemia. According to the Merck Manual (2013), hyperlipidaemia is the increased synthesis of hepatic lipoproteins.

Having over six months of symptoms characterizes chronic hepatitis B, which increases the risk of liver failure, cancer, and cirrhosis. However, vaccines and contraceptives are available to help prevent Treatments for Hepatitis A include hydration, rest, over the counter medicines and bed rest.

There are two vaccines that help protect individuals against hepatitis A: the hepatitis A vaccine and the hepatitis A and B combination vaccine. The hepatitis A vaccine protects all age groups against hepatitis A, while the combination vaccine only protects adults. The hepatitis vaccine is given in two doses. It is recommended that children get vaccinated at 12 to 23 months and again at 2 to 4 years. Adults who were not vaccinated as children can get vaccinated at any time so long as they get each dose 6 to 18 months apart. Some people should not get the hepatitis vaccine, such as those who are allergic to the vaccine ingredients and immune-compromised individuals. If you are sick, you should wait until you feel better to get the vaccine. The vaccine can also be given as post-exposure prophylaxis (after one contracts hepatitis A), to help fight the disease.
