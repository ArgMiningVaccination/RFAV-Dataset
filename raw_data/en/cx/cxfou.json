Extending the vaccination requirement provides our guests with the health and safety information and assurances they need to plan future travels.\" The line's health and safety protocols will continue to require all guests and crew to have completed a full course of COVID-19 vaccination (with two doses, if recommended by manufacturer) at least 14 days before their embarkation date. Guests will need to provide documents proving vaccination at the time of check-in before boarding the ship. In addition to health and safety assurance, the vaccination requirement will give guests the freedom to explore ashore on their own, without a protective \"bubble\" guided tour. Fully-vaccinated passengers also have an easier time traveling across multiple national jurisdictions, the line said. Other protective measures include COVID-19 tests at embarkation for both guests and crew; temperature checks when returning from ashore; a \"nimble\" mask policy; social distancing guidelines; and enhanced cleaning. Like many other operators, Crystal River Cruises is also requiring its crewmembers to wear masks in all public areas. As a luxury operator, Crystal River Cruises has the added benefit of a high volume to passenger ratio for built-in social distancing. Its all-suite ships were built for about half as many passengers as comparably-sized vessels operated by other lines. Its Crystal Mozart is Europe's most spacious river ship, with twice the beam of any competitor and room for just 120 guests. "}
