That's the message Charlie Lustman is delivering to audiences nationwide as part of his \"Musical HOPE Campaign.\" One of the next stops on his campaign trail is the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center's annual Cancer Survivors' Day celebration on June 5. The hundreds of cancer survivors, care- givers, health providers, family and friends expected to attend will hear the 45-year-old composer, performer and cancer survivor tell his story through a series of pop songs chronicling his cancer experience\u2014from diagnosis and treatment through recovery. Some songs give a lighthearted spin to otherwise scary cancer-related experiences. His album's title track, \"Made Me Nuclear,\" was inspired by his CT scans. \"Music reaches even deeper than words allow,\" Lustman says. \"If what I'm doing takes the edge off of scary experiences and people can see the light at the end of the tunnel from my experience, then I think, 'mission accomplished.'\" This year's event will be held from 1-3:30 p.m., Sunday, June 5, at Washtenaw Community College in the Morris Law-rence Building as part of National Cancer Survivors' Day. The event is free and open to cancer survivors as well as their families, friends and care providers. The national event began in 1987 as a way to inspire cancer patients and to show that life after a cancer diagnosis is possible. Lustman's performance is a perfect fit for both efforts. In March 2006, Lustman was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a rare form of cancer, in his upper jaw bone. He lost three-quar -ters of his jaw to the disease. \"I'm still singing,\" Lustman says. \"I have a prosthetic and now I sing better than I ever have before. My message truly is about overcoming life challenges.\" As a 20-year cancer survivor, Shaun \"Marty\" Martin knows the difficulties facing current cancer patients. He says the Cancer Center's event is an opportunity to forget the bad and celebrate surviving. Martin, a longtime member of the Survi- vors' Day planning committee, says a new theme and keynote speaker are selected each year, but one element never changes. \"The atmosphere is always very fun,\" Martin says. \"This is a time to celebrate being a survivor. For the time that we have them at the event, we try to make it as fun and educational as possible.\"Information tables will be set up and attendees can learn more about survivor - ship issues, caregiver support and other concerns. Various community agencies and U-M support services representatives will be available to answer questions. For those who attend, the event offers a chance to connect with hundreds of others with similar experiences. \"When you see the number of survivors all there all celebrating, you realize no one is alone in this whole thing,\" Martin says. Charlie Lustman will perform inspirational songs at Survivors' Day on June 5.SPRING 2011 4forum | Bounty of the Mediterranean U-M researcher examines diet's potential for preventing cancer Researchers have long noted that popula- tions living along the Mediterranean Sea have lower risk of cancer, heart disease and stroke. The lower risk may be linked to the regional diet \u2014one high in vegetables, whole grains, fruits, fish and olive oil. To better understand the potential benefits of a Mediterranean diet, Zora Djuric, Ph.D., a research professor of family medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School, has developed a study to examine the role of diet in preventing colon cancer. We talked with her to learn more about her research.Q: WhaT IS IT abouT The MedITeRRaNeaN dIeT ThaT MakeS IT a Good caNdIdaTe foR PReveNTING coloN caNceR? A: The various components of the diet seem to be a preventative for cancer. For example, increased fish intake and increased intake of certain vegetables may have a beneficial effect. It's also the large variety of fruits and vegetables that are consumed in a Mediterranean diet. Different types of fruits and vegetables have different nutritional compounds, or phytochemicals, in them. bounty of the Mediterranean Zora Djuric, Ph.D., is studying the Medi-terranean diet and its potential for preventing cancer. SPRING 2011 5 Q: IT SeeMS We Read ReGulaRly abouT NeW ReSeaRch RelaTed To PhyTocheMIcalS, Such aS oMeGa-3 faTTy acIdS oR beTa caRoTeNe, IN food. WhIch oNeS aRe IMPoRTaNT? A: We are continuing to discover new nutritional compounds in food and are learning more about how they work every day. The different classes of antioxidant micronutrients, such as carotenoids and flavonoids, that are being discovered in fruits and vegetables are really amazing. And we're finding the same thing with whole grains: It's not just the fiber but a whole range of phytochemicals that seem to be preventative. It's really like getting a vitamin pill that has a thousand different things in it. It's good to get all those compounds by eating a variety of foods. Q: hoW aRe you MeaSuRING The effecTS of The MedITeRRaNeaN dIeT oN coloN caNceR PReveNTIoN? A: We recruited 120 people with an increased risk for colon cancer to participate in a study. We randomly assigned the study participants to one of two groups: for six months, one group would eat a Mediterra- nean diet, and the other group would follow the U.S.D.A.'s recommended Healthy People 2010 diet. Participants completed question-naires about their eating habits and spoke regularly by phone with a dietitian. We also took blood samples and performed a flex-ible sigmoidoscopy to monitor biochemical changes in the colon that may be related to colon cancer risk. Our last patient completes the study in May, and we hope to have results to report within a year.Q: hoW doeS The MedITeRRaNeaN dIeT dIffeR fRoM The healThy PeoPle 2010 dIeT? A: The Healthy People 2010 diet calls for eating plenty of fruits and vegetables and whole grains. It moderates fat intake and limits saturated fat. The Mediterranean diet favors monounsaturated fats from olive oil, nuts and fatty plant-based foods, such as olives. It also requires whole grains; low-fat protein, such as poultry, fish and legumes; and seven to nine servings from two fruit categories and six vegetable categories to ensure variety. Q: hoW Well have STudy PaRTIcIPaNTS beeN able To folloW The dIeTS? A: We were pleased that people were able to do it. It sounds complicated\u2014and it does take time to figure out how to eat everything\u2014but that's why we offer dietary counseling to ensure that the eating plans are working. People seem to like the Mediterranean diet, maybe because of the higher fat intake. It's very palatable, and that's really important. You can dream up the best diet, but if no one wants to eat it, it's not going to prevent cancer. Q: do you have oTheR MedITeR- RaNeaN dIeT STudIeS PlaNNed? A: Yes, we're writing a grant now to study the diet's effect in breast cancer survivors. People with other types of cancer tend to lose weight, but not those with breast cancer\u2014and we don't know why. An important goal of that study will be to look at preventing body fat gain. An earlier pilot study we conducted among women in 2007 seemed to indicate that this diet may be helpful. The women who ate a Mediterra- nean diet decreased the amount of polyun- saturated fat they ate by 50 percent while increasing monounsaturated fats by the same amount. They also ate twice as many fruits and vegetables, doubling their blood levels of carotenoids. Q: So The MedITeRRaNeaN dIeT could be beNefIcIal foR SuRvI-voRShIP aS Well aS PReveNTIoN? A: Absolutely. Unfortunately, research has shown that survivors tend to have more health problems than those who haven't had cancer. The Mediterranean diet seems to lower the risk for several diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It can be difficult to change the way you eat, since a lot more is wrapped up in food than health: It's about customs and values and feeding ourselves emotion-ally. But hopefully people will find it worthwhile, particularly if it tastes good. bounty of the Mediterranean The best way to benefit from the healthy compounds in fruits and vegetables is to eat a variety of them.cover story |Steps of hope Steps ofhope SPRING 2011 6Phil Brabbs channeled his passion by start-ing the Cancer Kicker Foundation to raise funds for multiple myeloma.Phil Brabbs is aiming for domination\u2014 which makes sense if you know him as a former University of Michigan football player. But if you meet Brabbs these days, you wouldn't necessarily think of \"domi-nation\" as you chat with this exceedingly polite, laid-back family man. That is, until he tells you about multiple myeloma. A day after his 28th birthday, Brabbs was diagnosed with multiple myeloma\u2014an illness whose median age at diagnosis is 68. Now 30 and married with three young children, Brabbs is determined to find a cure for his disease. While still undergoing aggressive treatment, he started the Cancer Kicker Foundation to support multiple myeloma research at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. The organization taps into volunteers' creativity, providing fund-raising tools for volunteers who would like to raise awareness as well as dollars. One of the many events Cancer Kicker volunteers are participating in this year is the Dexter-Ann Arbor Run. \"The ultimate mission of the organiza- tion is to encourage people to dominate life,\" Brabbs says. \"To live with passion and energy, and especially for those diagnosed with cancer, to look beyond it and live passion-ately. I'm living that out, and I'm encouraging everyone to do that as well.\" With that in mind, we've put together the top three reasons our patients have chosen to direct their passion toward participating in cancer awareness walks.

Asking for money may seem daunting, but people like to give to good causes\u2014especially if you can convey how important that cause is to you. When it became clear in 1998 that Emily Avers would need a blood stem-cell transplant to treat her non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, she turned to her only sibling, Laura Duda. Doctors told her that siblings only have a one in four chance of matching. Laura did. Ten years later, the sisters decided it was time to commemorate the procedure, which eradicated the cancer. Avers and Duda flew to Jamaica to walk a half-marathon for the Cancer Support Community (which at that time was known as The Wellness Community of Southeast Michigan). \"The walk was a celebration of getting to that point,\" Avers says. \"We couldn't believe I was all of a sudden cured because no one wanted to say that word for a long time. But now that I had been cancer-free for so many years, I wanted to involve people in a cause that we both cared about. We wanted to support not only patients, but the kids and families of cancer survivors. It was easy to gather support for that.\" STEP 2 Walk To ReMeMbeR. Walk foR coMMuNITy. Brian Darwin was an active guy: His work required physical labor. He raised four young athletes. He knew his body so well that he told his wife, Brenda, that he felt like a softball was growing inside of him even before doctors diagnosed him with pancreatic cancer. \"I think the hardest thing on him during the whole experience was his body failing him,\" Brenda Darwin said. \"He was used to being so active and doing so much. Now he was limited.\" So when one of Brenda's daughters found out about the Pan- creatic Cancer Action Network's annual PurpleStride walk at the Detroit Zoo, the Darwin family decided it would be the perfect way to honor Brian, who by then was receiving hospice care. The family gathered again last fall and plan to make it an annual event. For Brenda, the sense of community she felt during the walk was overwhelming. \"I think it's important to get involved, even though you might be apprehensive at first,\" Brenda said. \"There's a feeling of comfort that comes over you just by being around other people who know what it's like. You feel like you know these people, even if you don't. You're all going through the same thing.\" Sisters Emily Avers (right) and Laura Duda completed the Strides for Hope half-marathon for the Cancer Support Community. The Darwin family was joined by many friends at the PurpleStride walk. SPRING 2011 8cover story |Steps of hope STEP 3 Walk To ShoW caNceR Who'S boSS. Rachel McCormack can't help but notice the way her brain tumor has affected her body. Since undergoing surgery that removed 90 percent of the tumor, she hasn't been quite as steady as she used to be. Her eyesight suffers. But her legs are good, so she has set a lofty goal: to run the Chicago Marathon in October. McCormack is a life-long runner, and this isn't the first time she's set her sights on a marathon. This time, though, it will be a little different. She will have her husband, Michael, right by her side to help guide her through the race as she runs to support the American Brain Tumor Association. Although McCormack is still receiving chemo-therapy, she has begun training after consulting first with her neuro-oncologist, Larry Junck, M.D. Junck encourages patients who can physically tolerate exercise to pursue it. Even light activity, such as walking around the house a couple times a day, helps maintain general health as well as bone and muscle strength while keeping up morale. In any case, the key is to gradually increase endurance. As of February, McCormack was up to running about three miles.\"You can let cancer make your life come to a halt\u2014and it is tough. But I think this is something I can do,\" McCormack says. \"The tumor is still going to be there, but I'm going to feel like I've beaten it. I'm going to show it who's boss.\" WAlk SMAr T G. Lita Smith, an acute care nurse practitioner in the University of Michigan multidisciplinary Breast Care Center, knows from experience what it takes to participate in a cancer awareness walk. To honor her patients and her mother\u2014who died 20 years ago of breast cancer\u2014she has walked many times in the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure. Smith has even completed the 60-mile Komen 3-Day for the Cure twice, both times accompanied by her mother-in-law. We asked Smith for her tips on training for cancer awareness walks. Here's what she had to say: TIPS 1. Talk to your doctor first. Exercise is good for you, but any time you begin a new fitness regi- men\u2014whether it's to train for a cancer awareness walk or to improve your health\u2014you should talk to your health care team first. 2. If you're still on treatment or have recently completed treatment, manage your expecta-tions. Even if you were very physically fit before treatment, you may find that you become more easily tired. Listen to your body. If you're feeling low on energy, consider exercising for shorter periods of time or every other day, rather than daily. However, don't assume exercise will make you more tired. Some studies have shown that exercise\u2014particularly when done outdoors\u2014may actually fight attentional and physical fatigue. 3. for first-time walkers, consider Relay for life. The American Cancer Society's annual Relay for Life starts each event with a lap for survivors. This is a relatively short walk that doesn't require serious training. You can also join a relay team, allowing you to manage how much you would like to walk throughout the event. 4. If you are in treatment or aren't up to walking, let your family and friends do it for you. Cancer awareness walks can be a powerful way for family and friends to show their support for you. Consider cheering them on from the sidelines or helping them with the online fund-raising aspects of the event.

Next, you are making yourself a light breakfast before you have to head out the door for your appointment and find you have to sit down to rest from the effort. If this scenario sounds familiar, you are not alone. Up to 96 percent of people treated for cancer report fatigue. How you eat, drink and spend your day can reduce your fatigue and may even boost your energy levels. eaTING foR eNeRGy You may feel like you are fighting a losing battle with fatigue. The fatigue itself can hinder eat- ing enough calories and protein to maintain energy by limiting your ability and desire to prepare healthy meals and snacks. This in turn will limit the amount you eat, which can result in more fatigue. If you are losing weight, it is important to eat more frequently to avoid losing muscle mass, which can lead to difficulty with daily activities. If you are not losing weight, it is important not to overeat for energy, as extra weight can worsen extreme tiredness. Choosing the right foods is key. Limit empty-calorie foods such as candy, soda pop, baked goods and other desserts. They may give you a quick energy boost initially but often will leave you feeling more drained once their effect wears off. Foods containing protein, healthy fats and fiber will give you more long-term energy, in addition to having more vitamins and minerals to support your body's needs. (For helpful tips for adding more healthy foods into your diet when you are running low on energy, see the tips section.) dRINk uP Dehydration can make you feel drained. Make sure you drink at least eight to 12 cups of fluid daily to help you meet your hydration needs. Focus on drinking water if you have maintained your weight, or use calorie-dense items like 100 percent fruit juice, milk or sports drinks if you have been losing weight. Keeping a visual record of your fluid intake can be helpful so you keep on track. At the begin-ning of each day, fill a 2-liter (64 fluid ounces) container with tap water. Each time you drink any type of fluid or liquid-containing food (soup broth, ice cream, Jell-O), pour out that amount of liquid from the 2-liter container so that you have a running tally of your fluid intake for the day. Cancer Center dietitians Nancy Burke, R.D., Danielle Karsies, R.D., M.S., and Joan Daniels, R.D., offer tips for fighting fatigue. Peanut butter and nuts are packed with protein to give you more energy.Staying hydrated can help ward off fatigue. a healthy booStSPRING 2011 13 exeRcISe foR eNeRGy You may have become more sedentary since beginning treatment, thinking that exercise will only sap the little energy you have left, but you could be wrong. There is a convincing link between physical activity and lower risk of colon cancer, and a possible link to lower rates of postmenopausal breast and endometrial cancer. Some studies have suggested that cancer patients who engage in moderate physical activity for at least three to five hours per week may experience better outcomes and fewer side effects of treatment, including fatigue. Additionally, light to moderate physical activity has been shown to improve mood, maintain strength, boost your immune system and support quality sleep. Don't be discouraged if you feel you can't muster enough energy for more than a leisurely stroll. A study at the University of Georgia found that the group who took part in low-intensity exercise had a greater reduction in their fatigue levels compared to the moderate-intensity group (65 percent vs. 49 percent less fatigue). So whether it is doing light housework, taking a leisurely stroll or following a yoga video, get moving and reap the benefits.

It's like talking to a brother about everything you do in life. And if I need a prayer, he'll say a prayer. He's just a good guy.\" When Charlton first meets with new patients, he begins by talking with them to find a common frame of reference. He listens to patients' stories and helps identify what brings them comfort. A key part of Charlton's work involves help- ing patients to find ways to adapt to the changing landscape of their diagnoses and their lives. Often, people are so caught up in the logistics of cancer care that they aren't able to take care of themselves emotionally, Charlton says. But when the effects of treatment slow them down to the point where they can't do everything they'd like to, they get frustrated and begin to deal with how the disease is impacting more than the physical and practical aspects of their lives. It can also be difficult to go to church, as in Apsitis's case. Penny Apsitis, Al's wife, says it has been about three years since they've been able to attend their Methodist church. \"You start to feel left out,\" she says. \"Wayne is filling a void in our life. Ministering isn't just talking about God; it's serving God, and he serves God. When he shares with my husband, he's not just sharing prayer. It's compassion and love.\" Deacon Wayne Charlton trolls the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center's infusion area, seeking patients who might need a good talk. Every once in a while, he approaches a patient, who responds with a stricken look. \"They get a panicked look on their face like, 'Do you know something I don't?'\" Charlton says. Influenced by too many movies, patients sometimes think a chaplain's only role is to pray for patients near death. But in reality, spiritual care providers like Charlton work with patients with many different types of illnesses\u2014life-threatening or not\u2014to help them work through religious or spiritual issues that are oftentimes a part of illness. Charlton, who recently joined the Cancer Center, has been helping patients for 20 years as a member of the U-M Health System's Spiritual Care Department. \"I see myself as another resource for hope for patients,\" Charlton says. \"The time I spend with patients is dedicated to caring for their spirit, which needs as much healing as the mind and body.\" Charlton says he meets with patients who have a lot of questions, but sometimes they have problems formulating them, often because they are confused or angry. If someone has a religious or spiritual orientation, it can be helpful to work through these questions in that context so that they can use that foundation as a resource for coping.coping | Caring for your spirit Caring for your spirit Deacon Wayne Charlton offers conversation, prayer to Cancer Center patients To make an appointment for a spiritual care consultation, ask your health-care team or call 877-907-0859 .Deacon Wayne Charlton offers Cancer Center patients spiritual counseling.Learn more about the latest cancer research at the University of Michigan at mcancer.org/thrive . click | research rounD-up SPRING 2011 15 DePReSSIoN DRUG MAy ReLIeve PAIN FRoM BReASt CANC eR tReAtMeNt, StUDy FINDS A drug commonly used to treat depression and anxiety disorder was effective at reducing joint and muscle pain associated with a breast cancer treatment, according to a study from the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. The study was presented recently at the 33rd Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. The women in the study were taking aromatase inhibitors, a type of drug designed to block the production of estrogen, which fuels some breast cancers. About half of women taking these drugs experience aches and pains in their joints and muscles that cannot be adequately relieved by over-the-counter painkillers. Up to 20 percent of these women will stop taking an aromatase inhibitor because of this pain. \"Since women typically take these drugs for five years, it is impor - tant that the side effects not interfere too much with their quality of life, or they will be less likely to continue taking the medicine, which may lead to a greater chance of their breast cancer returning,\" said study author N. Lynn Henry, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of internal medicine at the U-M Medical School. The study looked at the drug duloxetine, or Cymbalta, which is used to treat depression and generalized anxiety disorder. It's also been shown to work for other chronic pain conditions, such as fibro- myalgia and osteoarthritis. It is believed to decrease pain through its actions on the central nervous system. Of 29 patients evaluated, nearly three-quarters reported that their pain had decreased by at least 30 percent. On average, after eight weeks of treatment, pain scores declined 61 percent. Only one in five patients stopped taking duloxetine because of side effects. \"Duloxetine appears to be effective at reducing the muscle and joint pain many women experience from aromatase inhibitors, with only mild additional side effects,\" Henry said. The researchers are planning a randomized, controlled trial com- paring duloxetine to placebo. Henry is also doing research looking at the effect of aromatase inhibitors on pain perception to better understand why women develop pain.U-M S tUDy LIN kS vItAMIN D to LUNG CANC eR SUR vIvAL Recent research suggests vitamin D may be able to stop or prevent cancer. Now, a new study finds that an enzyme that plays a role in metabolizing vitamin D can predict lung cancer survival. The study, published by University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers in the journal Clinical Cancer Research, suggests that this enzyme stops the anti-cancer effects of vitamin D. Levels of the enzyme, called CYP24A1, were elevated as much as 50 times in lung adenocarcinoma compared with normal lung tissue. The higher the level of CYP24A1, the more likely tumors were to be aggressive. About a third of lung cancer patients had high levels of the en- zyme. After five years, those patients had nearly half the survival rate as patients with low levels of the enzyme. Researchers then linked this to how CYP24A1 inter - acts with calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D. CYP24A1 breaks down calcitriol, which has a normal and crucial role when kept in check. But when levels of CYP24A1 climb, the enzyme begins to hinder the positive anti- cancer effects of vitamin D. Previous studies have linked low levels of vitamin D to a higher incidence of cancer and worse survival. Researchers are looking at using vitamin D to help prevent lung cancer from returning and spreading after surgery. This new study suggests the possibility of using CYP24A1 levels to personalize this approach to those likely to benefit most. \"Half of lung cancers will recur after surgery, so it's important to find a way to prevent or delay this recur - rence. A natural compound like vitamin D is attractive because it has few side effects, but it's even better if we can determine exactly who would benefit from receiv- ing vitamin D,\" says study author Nithya Ramnath, M.D., associate professor of internal medicine at the U-M Medical School. Researchers also are working to identify drugs that block CYP24A1. Blocking the enzyme would reinstate the positive anti-cancer effects of vitamin D, suggesting that this inhibitor could potentially be combined with vitamin D treatments. Vitamin D research continues, but in the meantime, Cancer Center care providers do not recommend exceeding the current recommended dose of 600-800 IU of vitamin D daily.

Management & Supportive Care: 877-907-0859dISCUSSInG VITAMIn d Vitamin D is the media darling of the supplement world: Studies have linked it to lowering the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. But is it hype? Or should you be paying more attention to your vitamin D intake? For most people, the recommended daily allowance for vitamin D is 15 mcg or 600 IU per day, according to pharmacist Emily Mackler and registered dietitian Danielle Karsies, both of the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center's Symptom Management & Supportive Care Program. The best way to get it is to eat foods rich in vitamin D, such as fatty fish, egg yolks or milk fortified with the vitamin.
