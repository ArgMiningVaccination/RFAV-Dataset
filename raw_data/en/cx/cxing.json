About Joseph Giacona I was blessed to receive life's golden ticket - a second chance - after surviving an acute bout of Lyme disease that left me paralyzed. Following recovery from paralysis I continued to suffer from low energy, frequent colds, poor sleep, sinus issues, allergies, digestive complications, pain, brain fog, terrible skin problems and hair loss. I consulted various doctors with no success, drugs weren't working and I was terrified that I would never recover. "}
