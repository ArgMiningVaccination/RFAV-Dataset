It is the universal symbol of awareness and support for those who are living with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). As people across the globe commemorate World AIDS Day, it is important to know about treatments for HIV. Once people figure out the difference between HIV and AIDS, the next question that pops into their minds is the treatment. Surprisingly, none of the current treatment options results in HIV cure, but various attempts have been made. Many people even look for alternative treatments. Even though Ayurveda and natural treatments don't have a cure, they seem to help in relieving some symptoms of HIV infection.

On the other hand, [AIDS](https://www.healthshots.com/preventive-care/self-care/what-is-the-difference-between-hiv-and-aids/), which stands for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is the name that is used to describe many potentially life-threatening infections as well as illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely hit by the HIV virus. As per NHS, most people who are infected with HIV experience a flu-like illness that happens two to six weeks after infection. After the short illness, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years. Some of the symptoms include fever, sore throat, body rash, tiredness, joint pain, muscle pain and swollen glands. HIV treatments have progressed significantly in the past two decades, but current treatment strategies are far from perfect, according to AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses.
