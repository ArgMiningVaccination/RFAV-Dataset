In surveys of patients seeking psychiatric care, estimates of CAM use range from 8% to 57%; the most frequent uses are for depression and anxiety disorders. A population-based study in the United States found that 9% of respondents had anxiety attacks and 57% of these individuals had used CAM.1 Similarly, in a Finnish population-based study (N=5,987) 35% of subjects reported some form of CAM use in the previous year; those with comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders used CAM most frequently.2 Unfortunately, a MEDLINE search shows that the number of stud - ies examining psychotropic medications dwarfs the number of studies on even the most common CAM treatments used for psychiatric disor - ders. Far more patients with diagnosed mental disorders are studied in trials of standard treatments than CAM treatments. Because very few studies evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CAM treatments for psy - chiatric disorders, the risk-to-benefit ratio is difficult to calculate. Al - though several CAM treatments for depressive disorders have enough support to be considered options,3 CAM options for anxiety disorders are fewer and have less evidence of efficacy. For these reasons, it is hard to recommend any CAM treatment as first line. Despite the relative lack of high quality research on CAM treatment outcomes, high rates of CAM use make it critical for clini - cians to understand what treatments are available\u2014or at least which treatments should be favored if patients are intent on trying them.

Limitations of CAM research There are several limitations to the research literature on CAM approaches for anxiety disorders.4 First, there is a wide diversity of practices considered alternative or comple - mentary and various ways in which these methods are applied across cultures. Some authors consider complementary medi - cines to be only herbal remedies, whereas others include individual therapies such as acupuncture, aromatherapy, herbal therapy, homeopathy, iridology, naturopathy, and reflexology.5 This article defines \"alterna -tive\" treatments as those other than a form of psychotherapy or an FDA-approved medication that substitute for standard psychiatric treatment, and \"complemen - tary\" approaches as those used to augment standard psychiatric treatments. Anxiety and stress are ubiquitous, per - haps motivating interest in CAM options and prompting research on heterogeneous groups of individuals with poorly defined clinical syndromes or with isolated symp - toms of anxiety or subjective distress. Few studies examine well-defined patient groups with diagnosed anxiety disorders. There are also multiple research design problems, including poorly specified treat - ments, poorly chosen placebos, and inter - preting nonsignificant differences from established treatments as equivalence in underpowered studies.

Significant improvement in yoga group between 3 and 6 weeks but not for controls Shannahoff-Khalsa et al, 19991121 OCD patients randomly assigned to kundalini yoga (N =11) or relaxation and mindfulness meditation (N =10). Multiple outcome measures; Y-BOCS was primarySeven in each group completed 3 months; patients who practiced yoga demonstrated greater improvements on Y-BOCS. Intent-to-treat analysis (Y-BOCS) for the baseline and 3-month tests showed that only the yoga group improved. Groups were merged for an additional year of yoga; at 15 months, the final group (N =11) improved 71% on the Y-BOCS HAM-A: Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale; IPAT: Institute for Personality Testing, effectiveness of yoga for anxiety disordersTable 1Current Psychiatry Vol. 9, No. 10 47 The CAM treatments reviewed in this article have 2 randomized controlled tri - als (RCTs) that support their use for pa - tients with diagnosed anxiety disorders, and 1 study that shows that the treatment can induce remission. Yoga In 2005 Kirkwood et al carried out the first systematic review of research evidence for the effectiveness of yoga in anxiety treat - ment.6 Of 19 studies identified, 4 RCTs and 1 nonrandomized trial met their inclusion criteria, which were an anxiety disorder di - agnosis, use of yoga or yoga-based exercis - es alone, and anxiety rating scales used as outcome measures. Most found significant improvement in anxiety symptoms with yoga compared with placebo. Details of the 5 trials evaluated in Kirkwood's review are summarized in T able 1 (page 44) .7-11 Since the 2005 review, 3 additional stud - ies of yoga and anxiety have been pub - lished, but none would meet Kirkwood's inclusion criteria. One that evaluated a het - erogeneous group of patients using an inter - vention with multiple components\u2014only 1 of which was yoga\u2014found the intervention significantly reduced anxiety scores.12 A second study comparing yoga with relax - ation in 131 patients with mild-to-moderate stress but no anxiety disorder diagnosis showed yoga was as effective as relaxation in improving anxiety symptoms as mea - sured by the anxiety subscale of the State Trait Personality Inventory.13 In a study of 183 nonrandomized survivors of the 2004 southeast Asia tsunami with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, yoga- based breathing either alone or paired with trauma reduction exposure techniques sig - nificantly reduced PTSD symptoms com - pared with wait-list controls.14 Conclusion. Few controlled studies evalu - ated yoga for anxiety disorders, and all have significant methodologic limitations and/or poor methodology reporting. The diagnostic conditions treated and both yoga interventions and control conditions varied. However, these limited results are encouraging, particularly for treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). There is little information regarding safe - ty or contraindications of yoga. Reported attrition rates were high in most studies, which may raise concerns about patient motivation and compliance. Exercise The literature examining the relationship between exercise and depression is exten - sive, but much less has been published about exercise in patients with anxiety disorders (Table 2) .15-17 In a 10-week trial, Broocks and colleagues compared clomip -Clinical Point Several RCTs found significant improvement in anxiety symptoms with yoga compared with placebocontinued from page 44 Study Design Results Broocks et al, 19991546 patients with panic disorder randomly assigned to 10 weeks of running, clomipramine, or wplacebo pillsBoth exercise and clomipramine resulted in significant decreases in symptoms but clomipramine improved symptoms earlier and more effectively Merom et al, 20081621 patients with panic disorder, GAD, or social phobia randomly assigned to GCBT and either a home-based walking program or educational sessions GCBT plus walking had a significant effect on depression, anxiety, and stress compared with GCBT plus educational sessions Abrantes et al, 20091715 patients with OCD assigned to a 12-week exercise intervention that was added to their standard behavioral and/ or pharmacologic treatmentSubjects reported improved mood, anxiety, obsessions, and compulsions after each exercise session GAD: generalized anxiety disorder; GCBT: group cognitive-behavioral therapyExercise for anxiety: More research is neededTable 2CAM for anxiety Current Psychiatry October 2010 48 ramine, exercise (running), and placebo in 46 outpatients with panic disorder.15 Both exercise and clomipramine, 112.5 mg/d, significantly reduced panic symptoms compared with placebo, but clomipramine was more effective and faster-acting. A more recent RCT compared group cognitive-behavioral therapy (GCBT) plus a home-based walking program vs GCBT and in 21 patients with panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or so - cial phobia.16 Compared with GCBT plus educational sessions, GCBT plus walking had a significant effect on self-reported depression, anxiety, and stress. Results differed by diagnosis; the most marked effects occurred in individuals with social phobia, whereas benefits for those with panic disorder or GAD were questionable. Fifteen patients with OCD were recruit - ed to participate in a 12-week, moderate- intensity aerobic exercise program added to their standard behavioral and/or phar - macologic treatment.17 Subjects demon - strated improvement in negative mood, anxiety, obsessions, and compulsions after each exercise session. Changes after each session persisted over the 12-week inter - vention, although the magnitude attenu - ated over the duration of the intervention. Conclusion. Although initial results from small trials suggest exercise may help im - prove anxiety symptoms, further studies are needed to determine how to best use exercise training to treat anxious patients, specifically regarding dose-response re - lationship, differences in effectiveness between aerobic and resistance training, and the mechanisms by which exercise im - proves psychiatric symptoms. Bibliotherapy Investigation of bibliotherapy for treat - ment of anxiety disorders has been limited (Table 3) .18-20 A 2009 RCT demonstrated that for 21 patients with mild-to-moderate social phobia, bibliotherapy\u2014in the form of an 8-week self-directed CBT program with minimal therapist involvement\u2014was superior to a wait-list control and induced clinically significant change in approxi - mately one-third of patients.20 Rapee et al randomly assigned 267 chil - dren age 6 to 12 with anxiety disorders to bibliotherapy that consisted of parents treating their children in the home with written materials, 9 sessions of GCBT, or a wait-list control condition.19 Bibliotherapy provided by parents demonstrated benefit compared with wait-listing but was not as efficacious as GCBT at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up.

One-third of patients experienced clinically significant change CBT: cognitive-behavioral therapyPreliminary evidence supports bibliotherapy for select anxiety disordersTable 3Current Psychiatry Vol. 9, No. 10 49 list.18 Both treatments were more effective than wait-listing in reducing the frequency of panic attacks, severity of physical panic symptoms, catastrophic cognitions, ago - raphobic avoidance, and depression. Both interventions maintained their effects at 3- and 6-month follow-up and produced clin - ically significant change in most patients. Conclusion . Some preliminary evidence supports the effectiveness of bibliotherapy for social anxiety disorder, childhood anxi - ety disorders, and panic disorder. Dietary supplements Many dietary and herbal supplements are purported to have therapeutic efficacy for anxiety symptoms. Because of inadequate FDA regulation of manufacturing and marketing of these agents, most of these supplements have not been tested on pa -tients with anxiety disorders.21 Limited evidence supports the use of kava for GAD and inositol for panic disorder (Table 4) enous to South Pacific islands\u2014has effects greater than placebo and comparable to standard treatments for mild to moderate - ly severe GAD. A Cochrane meta-analysis22 of 11 trials with 645 participants concluded that kava is effective for reducing GAD symptoms, with risks comparable to stan - dard treatments for up to 6 months of use. Case reports of kava-associated liver toxicity led to a marketing ban in Canada in 2000, followed shortly by Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom. In 2002 the FDA issued a Consumer Advi - sory29 discouraging kava use. Since then a flurry of research has looked for sources of possible toxicity, including individual Clinical Point Preliminary evidence supports bibliotherapy for social anxiety disorder, childhood anxiety disorders, and panic disorderStudy Design Results Kava Pittler et al, 200322Meta-analysis of 11 RCTs with a total of 645 GAD patients Compared with placebo, kava significantly reduced anxiety as measured by total HAM-A score Witte et al, 200523Meta-analysis of 6 RCTs using kava extract WS1490 in patients with nonpsychotic anxiety disordersKava reduced HAM-A score more than placebo and seemed to be more effective in women and younger adults Sarris et al, 20092460 adults with 1 month of elevated generalized anxiety randomly assigned to an aqueous extract of kavaAqueous-extract kava was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing HAM-A score Inositol Benjamin et al, 19952521 patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia randomly assigned to inositol, 12 g/d, or placeboInositol significantly reduced frequency and severity of panic attacks and severity of agoraphobia compared with placebo Fux et al, 19962613 OCD patients randomly assigned to inositol,18 g/d, or placebo for 6 weeks Patients taking inositol had significantly lower Y-BOCS scores compared with those receiving placebo Fux et al, 19992710 OCD patients receiving an SSRI randomly assigned to augmentation with inositol, 18 g/d, or placebo for 6 weeksNo significant differences between treatments Palatnik et al, 200128In a crossover trial, 20 panic disorder patients completed 1 month of inositol, up to 18 g/d, and 1 month of fluvoxamine, up to 150 mg/d Improvements in HAM-A, CGI, and agoraphobia scores were similar for both treatments CGI: Clinical Global Impression scale; GAD: generalized disordersTable 4 continued on page 51Current Psychiatry Vol. 9, No. 10 51 sensitivities,29 excessive dosing, use of toxic parts of the kava plant instead of the roots,30,31 interactions with other hepato - active substances, and non-water based extraction methods. RCTs demonstrating kava's efficacy and safety were character - ized by careful dosing supervision, use of standardized kava extracts, and avoidance of interactions with other hepatoactive medications or CAM treatments. Doses 300 mg/d are recommended.22 RCTs that used the standardized acetone extract WS149023 found that women and younger adults show more positive effects from kava, and showed no liver toxicity when used for 1 to 24 weeks. A recent RCT that used kava extracts obtained via water- based methods showed kava had significant anxiolytic effects.24 However, a study of liver toxicity reports found that water-based ex - tractions, acetonic extractions, and ethanol extractions all have been associated with toxic hepatic reactions.32 Aqueous extraction does not guarantee safety, and the extraction solvent does not cause toxicity. A recent re - port of a severe liver reaction to the native drink by a tourist in Samoa33 suggests that aqueous extractions from the root stock\u2014 the type of kava used by South Pacific is - landers\u2014also can be unsafe. Conclusion . Multiple RCTs have found kava relatively safe and effective for treat - ing anxiety symptoms. Caution is necessary, however, because of reports of liver toxicity associated with its use. Physician oversight and monitoring of kava use are appropriate. Inositol. Evidence from RCTs suggests inositol, a natural isomer of glucose and a precursor in the phosphatidylinositol cycle, can significantly improve panic disorder symptoms.25-28 In 1 trial, efficacy and side ef - fects were comparable to fluvoxamine.28 Ef- fective doses ranged from 12 g/d to 18 Researchers tested inositol as monotherapy or augmentation to SSRIs compared with placebo26 but inositol augmentation added nothing to the effects of SSRIs.27 Conclusion . Inositol appears to be effec - tive in improving symptoms of panic dis - order. Its use for other anxiety disorders is unproven. Supervision is recommended The evidence base for most CAM interven - tions commonly used for anxiety is rela - tively poor and recent systematic reviews found few methodologically rigorous studies. This has not, however, diminished CAM treatments' popularity. Despite a paucity of high-quality studies regard - ing CAM for anxiety disorders, there is enough data supporting yoga, exercise, bibliotherapy, kava, and inositol to allow psychiatrists to collaborate with patients who wish to try these treatments. Advise patients that they may need physician su - pervision similar to that used with stan - dard psychiatric treatments. References 1. Kessler RC, Soukup J, Davis RB, et al.
