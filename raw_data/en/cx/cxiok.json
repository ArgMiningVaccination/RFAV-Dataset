Watch on Youtube: Listen on SoundCloud: The Art of Brewing Herbal Teas The art of brewing a daily pot of tea is a simple ritual. It's a promise to ourselves to pause, to heal, to recover, and breathe. To brew a cup of tea is an invitation to connect with our bodies and the four elements - fire, water, earth, air. Teas are organoleptic; they are sensual. That means they stimulate our senses. We taste the flavor, smell the aroma, see the beauty, hear the sound of the water pouring into our cup, and feel the warmth in our hands. All too often, this simple and rewarding act goes unnoticed, gets forgotten, and replaced by busyness in our lives. Teas- Infusions- Decoctions I'd like to give a brief overview of the distinctions between teas, infusions, and decoctions. They are similar, yet the distinctions matter when preparing therapeutic herbal medicine. You want your herbal remedies to be effective. So you need to know how to prepare them properly. Herbal Teas Teas are made with the plant's aerial parts, i.e. leaves, blossoms, seeds, soft stems, and aromatic roots. These plant parts are more delicate and contain volatile oils that are easily extracted by water. The standard amount for a pleasant cup of tea is: 1 teaspoon of dried herbs or 2 tablespoons of fresh herbs per cup of water. This is the amount of herb contained in a teabag. To make a medicinal or therapeutic tea: 1 Tbs dried herbs and 4 Tbs of fresh herbs per 8 oz of water. It's more convenient to make a pot of tea or a Quart jar of tea instead of making several cups throughout the day. To make a quart of medicinal tea: - add 4-6 Tbs of dried herbs to a quart jar or teapot. - Fill jar or pot with boiling water. - Seal jar or pot. - Let steep 5-10 minutes. - Strain and enjoy. Herbal Infusions Like teas, infusions also use aerial parts of the plants and extract the volatile oils, vitamins, minerals, and other plants' compounds. The length of time you steep the herbs changes the quality of your brew. Infusions are a lot like teas, except that you steep them longer. Here are a few ways to make infusions. - Add 4-6 Tbs of dried herbs to a quart jar and fill with boiling water. - Tightly seal the jar. - Let steep 20-90 minutes. - Strain, and enjoy. Herbal Decoctions When you are working with the woody parts of a plant, such as thick stems, barks, hard seeds, and roots, then teas and infusions cannot extract all of the medicinal properties, so you need to make a decoction instead to get those really concentrated, hard-to-extract chemicals from the roots. - There are a few methods of decocting herbs. Here is how I do it: - Add the herbs to cold water and bring to a gentle boil. - Keeping the lid on, simmer 15-20 minutes. - Remove from heat, let infuse or steep 20 minutes or longer. - Strain, and drink. 4 Herbal Teas for the Cold and Flu Season [Immune Tea](https://www.birthsongbotanicals.com/products/copy-of-immune-tea-bulk-3-oz) [Our Herbal Immune Tea blended with Elderberry and Echinacea](https://www.birthsongbotanicals.com/products/copy-of-immune-tea-bulk-3-oz) enhances and supports your body's natural immune function.
