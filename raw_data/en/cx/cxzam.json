Celebrations often come with unrealistic expectations, and aspirations to have the perfect meal, decorations, gifts and family interactions. But these rarely run to plan. It is important to set realistic expectations and focus on what matters to you most. For those who don't have family or who have limited social connections, the holiday season can be a time of increased loneliness. Try to seek out companionship within your local community. Look out for local events and celebrations you can be part of and consider volunteering to help others at this time. For some people, the season can be a time of increased stress caused by social interactions. This may have been compounded by Covid-19 restrictions over the past two years, as some people are simply out of the habit of socialising or still feel fearful of the risk of Covid-19 infection. It often helps to set boundaries to keep stress and anxiety in check. You can limit the number of people you see and the number of events you attend. You don't have to do everything you've done in previous years, especially high- stress rituals (such as queuing for Santa photos, excessive gift buying, preparing elaborate feasts or battling the Boxing Day sales). Prioritise what is most important to you and give yourself a break. With high inflation rates, financial stress is predicted to be greater this season so set realistic spending limits to stay within your budget. Try to engage in activities that reduce stress such as meditation, going for a walk or swim, getting out into nature or listening to music.Also try to maintain your normal healthy habits including eating well, exercising, getting enough sleep and drinking alcohol in moderation. If you do have the occasional set-back, remember to be kind to yourself. GP Availability Summer 2023 The table (page below) is a guide to which doctor works on which days.

By Dr Berlinda Png Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world. About two in three Australians will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer before the age of 70. Have you ever wondered if the mole on your body is cancerous? Types of skin cancer There are three main types of skin cancer, named after the type of skin cell they start from: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma Most common form of skin cancer but the least dangerous. Appear as round or flattened lump or scaly spots. Red, pale or pearly in colour. May become ulcerated, bleed and fail to heal. Grows slowly over months or years. Usually found on the upper body, head or neck. Squamous cell carcinoma Less common, but more dangerous than basal cell carcinoma. 1-2% can spread and cause death. Look for scaly red areas that may bleed easily, ulcers or non-healing sores that are often painful. Grows over a period of months. Often found on lips, ears and scalp. Melanoma skin cancer Least common but most serious form of skin cancer. Can appear in a new or an existing spot, freckle or mole that changes colour, size or shape. Grows over weeks to months anywhere on the body (not just areas that get lots of sun). If untreated, cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body. UV damage to the skin The following conditions are not cancer but may predispose you to skin cancer or be a warning sign that damage to the skin has occurred. Dysplastic naevi: Odd-shaped moles usually with uneven colouring that may indicate a greater risk of developing melanoma. Solar keratoses: Hard, red, scaly spots on sun- exposed areas of the skin, commonly occur on the head, neck and the backs of the hands. Prevention Skin cancer develops when a cell in the skin goes through a series of changes. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the main factor that causes skin cells to become cancer cells.Remember to protect your skin in five ways and book in for regular skin checks with your doctor. For more information, read about the Bulli Medical Practice Skin Check Clinic on our website or visit the Cancer Council: https://www.cancer.org.au/.

It is also a steep learning curve which may come with unforeseen challenges. When emotions are running high, common issues such as establishing breastfeeding, infant sleep and cry-fuss behaviour can be extremely difficult. Parents often hear advice that is outdated, contradictory and biassed. This can result in confusion, anxiety and stress for parents and their families. Knowing what is 'normal' infant behaviour, and where to find appropriate help and support is essential during this difficult period. Dr Hayley Glasson has recently completed extra training and accreditation to become a Neurodevelopmental Care (NDC) practitioner. She also obtained Diplomas in Childhood Health, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, as well as her own personal experience as a mother of two. What is Neurodevelopmental Care (NDC)? NDC (or Possums) was developed by Australian GP, Dr Pamela Douglas, in 2011. NDC is an evidence based, scientifically valid approach covering breastfeeding, sleep and cry-fuss behaviours. It is family focussed, aiming to empower parents with the extra knowledge and confidence to care for their newborn in line with their own values and goals. There is a focus on flexibility, experimentation and workability. It aims to de-medicalise sleep and cry- fuss concerns, and promotes responsive care-giving.What are parent and bub consults? A parent and bub consult is a one hour face-to-face appointment with Dr Hayley Glasson (booked as 30 minutes each for mum and baby) which allows a holistic, comprehensive and thorough assessment of specific concerns including (but not limited to): Infant feeding issues Maternal feeding issues Infant weight concerns Infant sleep concerns (note. NDC is not 'sleep training') 'Unsettled' infants Parent/infant bonding Parental mental health. Parent and bub consults are separate to your baby's routine vaccinations and six week postnatal visit. If your baby's vaccinations are due, these may be able to be done at the same time (please notify staff). How much do parent and bub consults cost? Total cost of appointment (what you will pay on the day) is $350.00 with $111.50 medicare rebate. Privacy & Medical Records Your medical record is a confidential document.
