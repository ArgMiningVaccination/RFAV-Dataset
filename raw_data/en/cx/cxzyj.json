What is Acupuncture? [Acupuncture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture) is a Traditional Chinese Medicine that has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of ailments. It is based on the belief that the body has an energy system known as qi (or \"chi\"). When this energy is blocked or out of balance, it can cause physical and emotional symptoms. Acupuncture is a form of [alternative medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine) that helps to restore balance and encourage the natural flow of energy by stimulating specific points on the body. It is a safe and effective therapy that is used to treat a wide range of health conditions. The Benefits Acupuncture has a number of health benefits, including: - Pain relief: Acupuncture can help to reduce pain, inflammation, and stiffness by stimulating the body's natural pain-relieving chemicals.

The Procedure We provide a safe and comfortable environment for our patients. During your appointment, you will be asked to fill out a questionnaire about your health and medical history. This will help us customize your [acupuncture treatment](https://www.google.com/maps?ll=27.4989278%2C-82.5748194&z=14&t=m&hl=en&gl=US&mapclient=embed&cid=2016884642925812680&q=acupuncture+treatment) plan. Next, our acupuncturist will assess your energy system and decide which points to stimulate. The needles used in acupuncture are very thin and should not cause any pain. After the needles have been inserted, you will be left to relax for about 15 to 30 minutes. This is a great time to meditate or practice deep breathing. The acupuncturist will then remove the needles and provide recommendations for lifestyle changes or additional treatments that may be beneficial. After your appointment, you may feel a sense of relaxation and well-being. Some people experience a sense of clarity or improved energy levels.
