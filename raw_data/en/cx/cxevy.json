It was honestly magical. The music of the rainforest, the all encompassing atmosphere, the feeling like I was on one big treehouse...just amazing. It is so vastly different than being in California, even if I went to the mountains somewhere. It really pulls you out of your comfort zone in the best way possible. Arkana is built to tear you open and allow for a rebirth of sorts. It pulls apart your heart, your emotional body, your spirituality, your fixed mentality and makes room for the truth of who you really are. No one person had the same experience with the Ayahuasca but everyone did come out a new person. There were so many wonderful medicines and ceremonies and the best part is, all of them supported each other. Also the sound baths, flower baths, yoga, breath-work etc really brought it all together. It would be impossible not to change in some way even if you chose not to experience any of the medicine. The facilitators were so wonderful and helpful. You can tell that they are all there out of love for others. I always felt safe and protected. As a woman in my late 20s it can be scary to go to another country on your own (well.. to the jungle in the middle of nowhere) and be put in such a vulnerable state with the medicine but I can tell you now, I always felt well taken care of and safe. If Mother Ayahuasca has been calling to you, look no further. This is the place the go! You will not find a more authentic experience than this. They have truly thought of everything to make your journey well rounded and as peaceful as possible. Getting there can be a little daunting but I assure you, once you arrive, you will not worry about a single thing (except for maybe the giant spiders haha). I hope this has helped anyone looking for a life changing experience. You will not regret it. Some things to be aware of: -This is the Amazon, there are bugs and giant spiders. Proceed with caution and you'll be fine. BUG SPRAY IS ESSENTIAL. Seriously though. I would recommend essential oil bug spray. It seemed to work the best. -When I went end of February it was very hot. Light layers, breathable fabrics, hats, sandals are best. -Bring a mosquito net for your face when you do the jungle tour. Also, wear long loose pants and long sleeved loose top to avoid getting bit by mosquitos. Seriously. -The medicine can be hard. Its important to trust the work and continue with faith. Your body might wig out and shake, you might puke your guts out, you might have no physical response at all. Every experience is valid and I promise you the medicine IS working. -Be ready for big changes. You might get information that sets you on a new path. Be ready to accept it. -Go in with an open heart and open mind. Everything you've been taught in traditional \"life\" will be ripped open and tested. Let go of everything you think you know and be ready to experience magic. This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
