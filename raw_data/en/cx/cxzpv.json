Dr. O'Leary obtained a B.S. in Biology from the University of Dallas with Cum Laude honors. She chose the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine because of its \"whole person\" approach. [What is Osteopathic Medicine?](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/expert-answers/osteopathic-medicine/faq-20058168) Dr. O'Leary completed an internship and residency at Scott and White Memorial Hospital, located in Temple, Texas. She completed her board certification in Family Medicine and practiced in Colleyville, TX for eight years. After a few years in practice, the frustration Dr. O'Leary experienced with the current U.S. medical model led her to search for alternative methods of care. She practiced in New Zealand and was introduced to native Maori medicinal plants, mind-body practices, and holistic care. Upon return to the U.S., she sought out functional, regenerative, and integrative medicine courses and obtained a board certification from the [Academy of Integrative Health and Medicine](https://aihm.org/). This journey through varied health and medical models, along with an insatiable desire to learn new things, has created the framework for Dr. O'Leary's practice. It's through prayer and divine wisdom which empowers the healing journey of our patients. Dr. Tara Boyd, ND* Dr. Boyd was born and raised in West Texas, and is a 3rd generation medical practitioner who fell in love with medicine at a very early age. She has a passion for tackling the toughest cases head-on, and has shaped her medical practice with a focus on children with chronic illnesses and pediatric neurological conditions including Autism Spectrum Disorder, PANDAS/PANS, ADHD, and Epilepsy. Prior to attending naturopathic medical school, Dr. Boyd spent over 10 years serving clients through massage/body work and counseling.

No matter the person or pathology that walks through the door, her goal is simple, to educate and empower patients to find lifelong health and vitality.
