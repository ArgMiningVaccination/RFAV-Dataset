As a consequence, they acquired the first approvals from drug regulators and were deployed at a large scale among priority groups, including healthcare workers. This phase IV study was designed as a nationwide cross-sectional survey to evaluate the post-vaccination side effects among healthcare workers in Slovakia. The study used a validated self-administered questionnaire that inquired about participants' demographic information, medical anamneses, COVID-19-related anamnesis, and local, systemic, oral, and skin-related side effects following receiving the BNT162b2 vaccine. A total of 522 participants were included in this study, of whom 77% were females, 55.7% were aged between 31 and 54 years, and 41.6% were from Banska Bystrica. Most of the participants (91.6%) reported at least one side effect. Injection site pain (85.2%) was the most common local side effect, while fatigue (54.2%), headache (34.3%), muscle pain (28.4%), and chills (26.4%) were the most common systemic side effects. The reported side effects were of a mild nature (99.6%) that did not require medical attention and a short duration, as most of them (90.4%) were resolved within three days. Females and young adults were more likely to report post-vaccination side effects; such a finding is also consistent with what was previously reported by other phase IV studies worldwide. The role of chronic illnesses and medical treatments in post-vaccination side effect incidence and intensity requires further robust investigation among large population groups.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-08-29", "cleaned_text": "Side Effects of mRNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccine: Nationwide Phase IV Study among Healthcare Workers in Slovakia [https://doi.org/10.3390/ph14090873](https://doi.org/10.3390/ph14090873) [Current Trends in RNA Virus Vaccines]( /journal/pharmaceuticals/special_issues/current_trends_in_RNA_virus_vaccines )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. This approval was depicted as a landmark in our journey towards controlling the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first described in Wuhan, China [ [2](#B2-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Comirnaty is a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA-based) COVID-19 vaccine developed and manufactured by BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH (Mainz, Germany) and Pfizer Inc (New York, NY, USA); therefore, its well-known market name is Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and it is scientifically referred to as BNT162b2 [ [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Comirnaty requires two intramuscular doses three to six weeks apart to achieve optimal immunization [ [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Two weeks later, the EMA approved another mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax [ [4](#B4-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Spikevax vaccine is developed by Moderna Inc (Cambridge, MA, USA) and manufactured and distributed in the EU by Moderna Biotech Spain S.L. (Madrid, Spain); therefore, its market name is Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, and the scientific name is mRNA-1273 [ [5](#B5-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Similar to Comirnaty, Spikevax requires two intramuscular doses four weeks apart to achieve optimal effectiveness. [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. According to the decree, vaccination of the Slovak population would be realised within eight consecutive phases [ [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. In \"Phase I\", frontline healthcare workers, medical and healthcare students, and essential public workers were planned to be inoculated; therefore, most of their vaccination relied on the available vaccines at that time, which were mRNA-based vaccines [ [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. The mRNA-based vaccines use mRNA molecular templates to deliver the genetic information to build the spike protein antigen, instead of delivering the antigen itself, to trigger the targeted immune response and production of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [ [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. [10](#B10-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Passive surveillance systems rely entirely on the spontaneous reporting of post-vaccination side effects by healthcare professionals or sometimes by the individuals or their guardians, while active surveillance systems follow a phase III-like approach where they tend to perform epidemiologic studies for the vaccinated individuals to collect their self-reported side effects [ [11](#B11-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [12](#B12-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. [12](#B12-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. These hybrid systems are needed now more than ever because they can overcome the drawbacks of sole passive surveillance and active surveillance systems. Jkowiak et al. (2021) evaluated the Polish passive surveillance system and concluded that it was unreliable in the case of COVID-19 vaccines vigilance, as they compared its data to targeted active studies and found serious discrepancies [ [13](#B13-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Out of the 2,810,050 administered doses of BNT162b2, 0.123% reported side effects, and 0.013% reported serious side effects. Compared to that, out of the 423,090 doses of mRNA-1273, 0.224% reported side effects, and 0.014% reported serious side effects [ [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. [15](#B15-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Not only can the life-threatening side effects trigger vaccine hesitancy, but the minor side effects that are usually self-limiting can also prevent individuals from making the decision to receive a vaccine, as even these minor side effects can lead to interruption of daily routine and absence from work/school [ [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Therefore, one of the effective approaches to counter vaccine hesitancy is to continuously and transparently monitor the safety of vaccines to enhance public confidence [ [17](#B17-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [18](#B18-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. 2. Results 2.1. Demographic Effects by Gender [Figure 2](#pharmaceuticals-14-00873-f002)). [Table 4](#pharmaceuticals-14-00873-t004)). 2.5. Local and Systemic Side Effects by Age [Figure 3](#pharmaceuticals-14-00873-f003)). [Table 5](#pharmaceuticals-14-00873-t005)). of these phase IV studies generally agreed with the results of the phase III trials executed by the manufacturers and published by the regulators, i.e., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [ [31](#B31-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [32](#B32-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. The main domains of agreement between phase III and phase IV studies are the intensity and duration of the side effects, while the domain of disagreement is the prevalence of the side effects and the health status of the recipients, as the phase III trials may tend to have relatively healthier individuals than the average general population [ [20](#B20-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. [19](#B19-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. The prevalence of injection site swelling (10.2% vs. 25.6%) and injection site redness (8.4% vs. 23%) among our participants was significantly lower than what was reported in the Czech Republic (2 = 39.672 and 39.462; Sig. < 0.001 and < 0.001, respectively). Similarly, the Czech healthcare workers reported significantly higher (2 = 8.805, 5.550, 0.023, and 0.046) prevalence of systemic side effects compared to our Slovak participants, e.g., headache (45.6% vs. 34.3%), muscle pain (37.1% vs. 28.4%), joint pain vs. fever (21.7% 15.3%), and chills (33.9% vs. 26.4%), respectively [ [19](#B19-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Moreover, the intensity of the side effects was higher among the Czechs 4.19 \u00b1 2.615 (0-12) [ [19](#B19-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. [22](#B22-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. They also surveyed a group of healthcare workers in the USA who received mRNA-1273, and they found the same common local side effects but with higher prevalence levels: injection site pain (94.21%), injection site swelling (15.05%), and injection site discolouration (3.47%) [ [21](#B21-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. The same trend was found in the CDC report, as BNT162b2 had less prevalent (2 = 507.889, 53.312 and 0.070; Sig. < 0.001, < 0.001 and = 0.792) local side effects compared to mRNA-1273: injection site pain (75.5% vs. 85.9%), injection site swelling (6.4% vs. 9%), and injection site (5.5% vs. 5.6%), respectively [ [31](#B31-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [32](#B32-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. [21](#B21-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [22](#B22-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. These results were in agreement with the CDC report, as mRNA-1273 had more prevalent (2 = fatigue (50.6% vs. 48.2%), headache (45.1% vs. 40.1%), (39.4% 25.5%), pain (29% vs. and chills vs. 19.7%), respectively [ [31](#B31-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [32](#B32-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Although, the cross-vaccine comparison would have been an appealing target for our study, it was not feasible to perform in our sample due to the suboptimal number of mRNA-1273 recipients. [33](#B33-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. The gender-based differences of post-vaccination side effect prevalence in our sample indicated the higher susceptibility of females to experience and report side effects. This finding is in line with what was previously reported by phase IV trials of COVID-19 vaccines from Italy, Saudi Arabia, and the UK, where female participants reported side effects more frequently than males [ [20](#B20-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [28](#B28-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [34](#B34-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)] Di Resta et al. (2021) found that Italian female healthcare workers had significantly higher serological values after receiving COVID-19 vaccines, which were correlated with a higher prevalence of post-vaccination side effects, thus suggesting that the more prevalent and severe side effects reported by females might be explained by their potent immune response [ [34](#B34-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. The role of sex hormones in immunity can also suggest an explanatory hypothesis for these differences; while testosterone decreases immune functions, the normal levels of oestrogen can stimulate humoral responses to viral infections [ [35](#B35-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [36](#B36-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Moreover, the empirically assumed lower pain threshold of females and the barriers of males to have help-seeking behaviours can further explain the gender-based differences in self-reported COVID-19 vaccine side effects [ [37](#B37-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [38](#B38-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [39](#B39-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. [40](#B40-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Regarding the age structure of our sample, 23.2% of physicians, dentists, and nurses were 18-29 years old, 58.6% were 30-49 years old, and 18.2% were 50 years old. According to the Slovak NHIC's latest report, 9.6% of physicians, dentists, and nurses were 18-29 years old, 48.8% were 30-49 years old, and 41.6% were 50 years old, thus indicating that our sample was a bit younger than the actual Slovak healthcare worker population which can be explained by the fact that this study used a digital form to collect the data [ [41](#B41-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), almost 90% of young and middle-aged adult Slovaks used the Internet on a daily basis compared to only 58% of old adults (55 years old) using the Internet daily [ [42](#B42-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Kelfve et al. (2020) found that online surveying might be a feasible option in health studies targeting an old population; however, the paper questionnaire remains an indispensable method to avoid missing subsets of the geriatric population that can bias the final estimates [ [43](#B43-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. [20](#B20-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Cuschieri et al. (2021) found that the BNT162b2 side effects reported by Maltese healthcare workers were significantly higher among those aged below 45 years old regardless of their sex [ [27](#B27-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Almufty et al. (2021) found that the <50-year-old participants were prone to increased prevalence and intensity of post-vaccination side effects in Iraq [ [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. In the Czech Republic, the local and systemic side effects of BNT162b2 were significantly more common among healthcare workers aged 43 years old or below [ [19](#B19-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. [31](#B31-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [32](#B32-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. In the CDC report of BNT162b2, people aged above 55 years had less prevalent side effects than those who were aged 55 years or below, e.g., injection site pain (68.7% vs. 80.6%), fatigue (42% vs. 53.1%), headache (31.8% fever (14.2% and vomiting (0.6% vs. 1.5%), respectively [ [31](#B31-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. In the CDC report of mRNA-1273, people aged above 64 years had less prevalent side effects than those who were aged 64 years or below, e.g., injection site pain (78.5% vs. 88.4%), injection site swelling (7.5% vs. 9.5%), injection site redness (4.8% vs. 5.9%), fatigue vs. headache (35.2% fever (17.7% [ [32](#B32-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. [44](#B44-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [45](#B45-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. The levels of INF-1 in young adults were found to be higher following COVID-19 vaccination than after COVID-19 infection; thus, also explaining why young adults tend not to exhibit severe symptoms following infection, while they have stronger side effects following vaccination [ [44](#B44-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. [21](#B21-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. These hypotheses can be carried on while attempting to understand the role of medical treatments in post-vaccination side effect incidence and intensity. [46](#B46-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. In our sample, there were only two participants who reported using antiepileptic drugs; therefore, subgroup analysis was not deemed possible to verify the assumptions of Kow et al. (2021) in terms of side effect incidence and intensity. [19](#B19-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Similarly, our participants consuming antihistamines had slightly more frequent systemic side effects, e.g., fatigue, fever, malaise, joint pain, and lymphadenopathy. A recent multi-centre retrospective study evaluated individuals who experienced immediate allergic reactions after the first dose of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. All the patients who received the second dose tolerated it, and 30% of them used antihistamine premedication to decrease the odds of experiencing severe allergic reactions after the second dose [ [47](#B47-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. The chronic use of antihistamines, as in our sample, can be to manage certain allergic conditions that would not necessarily increase the odds of allergic reactions after vaccination [ [48](#B48-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. [49](#B49-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [50](#B50-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [51](#B51-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. The oral manifestations of COVID-19 patients significantly, and they included dysgeusia, xerostomia, aphthous these symptoms is not fully understood, and a number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain them, including inflammatory response; the direct infiltration of SARS-CoV-2 to the lining epithelium of the oral cavity, which was found to be rich with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors; and secondary infection [ [49](#B49-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [50](#B50-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. Given the proposition that these oral manifestations are immune-dependent, the possibility of their emergence after receiving COVID-19 vaccines cannot be omitted. Therefore, we included the oral side effects within our inquiry for rare side effects. [20](#B20-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. In the first case series of severe reactions following the first dose of BNT162b2 in the USA, swollen tongue and swollen lip were reported in 9.5% and 19% of the reported cases of anaphylactic shock, respectively [ [61](#B61-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. The studies of Kadali et al. (2021) found that swollen lips and tongue were reported by 0.12% and 0.23% of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 recipients, respectively [ [21](#B21-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [22](#B22-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. The allergy to mRNA-based vaccine ingredients, especially Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), can be associated with the incidence of severe ulcerative lesions of the oral mucosa and inflamed lips, as reported in the recent case of Manfredi et al. (2021) from Italy [ [62](#B62-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. 3.1. Strengths 3.2. Limitations 3.3. Implications [17](#B17-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Design [63](#B63-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. The protocol had been registered a priori at the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) with the identifier NCT04706156, and the study was conducted and reported according to the STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies [ [64](#B64-pharmaceuticals-14-00873), [65](#B65-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. 4.2. Participants [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. The first inclusion criterion was to have received an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, as these vaccines were the only authorised vaccines by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) when Phase I was initiated in December 2020. The second inclusion criterion was to have received both doses of the vaccine. The participants did not receive financial rewards, and their participation was not incentivised by any other means of compensation to control selection and information biases. [66](#B66-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. The following assumption was used in the population survey (descriptive study) module: expected outcome frequency of 60%, error margin of 5%, and confidence level of (CI) 95%. Given that the target population size was 83,859, the minimum sample should be 404 participants, including a 10% predicted no-response rate ( [Figure 4](#pharmaceuticals-14-00873-f004)). 4.3. Instrument [19](#B19-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. First, a panel of experts checked the content validity of the proposed SAQ, then a group of volunteer healthcare workers filled it twice to evaluate the test re-test reliability, yielding substantial reliability with a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.89 [73](#B73-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. [74](#B74-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. 4.5. Analysis [75](#B75-pharmaceuticals-14-00873)]. The normal distribution of the dependent variables was evaluated through Shapiro-Wilk test with a significance level (Sig.) of 0.05. 5.
