JONES, RN, MNSC, LNC, APPEARING IN THE JANUARY 2007 ARKANSAS BOARD OF NURSING NEWSLETTER ENTITLED UPD ATE The Board frequently gets questions regarding someone \"working under my license. \" Nurses have a belief that when they delegate a task to an unlicensed person or make assign- ments to co-workers they are responsible for the other per- son's actions. Physicians make statements regarding the unlicensed person working in their office working \"under the physician's license. \" If you were riding with someone who is stopped for speeding and cannot produce a license for the officer, do you say, \"That's okay officer, they were driving under my license and I told them to speed?\" If you do, I'm sure the officer will continue writing the ticket just the same. Just as the drivers license is issued to one individual and valid only for one individual so is your professional license. A professional practice license is a privilege bestowed upon those who have completed the educational and licens- ing requirements of the State. Professional practice laws known as Practice Acts are passed by state legislators. Each state's practice act for the same profession may differ making it necessary to learn a new practice act when the licensee moves to a different state. In part, the act establishes the requirements for licensure, general scope of practice of the profession and who has the authority to issue, renew, or dis- cipline the license. The practice act does not give the license holder the authority to transfer their license privileges to any- one. The nurse must delegate the right task, to the right unli- censed person, for the right patient, under the right circum- stances, using the right communication, and be available for the right supervision. Nurses who delegate nursing tasks are responsible and accountable for ensuring that the delegation was appropriate. Unlicensed persons are responsible and accountable for competent performance of the nursing care that is delegated to them including calling the delegating nurse for assistance if the client's condition or needs change. When the nurse has delegated appropriately and responded appropriately to new information or requests for assistance the unlicensed person is responsible for their own actions and mistakes. When assigning nursing care to other licensed personnel, the nurse is responsible for making appropriate assignments. The assigning nurse should match the patient care needs with the nurse who has the appropriate scope of practice and skills to carry out the patient's care. The assigning nurse is to be responsive to requests for assistance and make assign- ment changes when the patient care needs change. The title of the assigning nurse could be Charge Nurse, Director of Nursing, Supervisor or Chief Nursing Officer. All are responsible for ensuring the patient has the right person assigned to their care. When the assigning nurse has assigned appropriately and responded appropriately to new information or requests for assistance the nurse accepting the assignment is responsible for their own actions and mistakes.Each person caring for a patient is responsible for know- ing their personal scope of practice. Each person is respon- sible for asking for assistance when asked to do a task out- side of their personal scope of practice and for reporting changes in the patient's condition or needs to the appropri- ate person. When all healthcare workers work within their scope of practice, no one has a need to \"work on your nurs- ing license. \"Page 2 - Iowa Board of Nursing Newsletter - May, June, July 2011 DISCLAIMER CLAUSE For advertising rates and information, please con- tact Arthur L.

ONLINE The Iowa Board of Nursing has made renewing licenses easier for many nurses in Iowa through online license renewal. Although many nurses are taking advantage of this service, there are still many more nurses who could benefit from it. There are many advantages to online renewal including: It is easy. Just go to the website at: nursing .iowa.go v All you need is your license number, social security number, date of birth, MasterCard, VISA or a debit card. Answer all the questions. Pay the $104.00 fee, which includes a $5.00 online convenience fee. It is fast. Once the online renewal process is complete your license is immediately renewed and will be mailed in three to five working days. It is convenient. You can renew on your computer at home, at midnight or on a holi- day if you choose. If you do not have a computer at home, you could renew on the computer at your local library or at your work place. Your information is secured/masked to protect your privacy. Online renewal reduces errors. The system will not let you move forward until all questions are answered. Online renewal is available for RNs and LPNs only. Late online renewal is also available through the 15th of the month following the expiration date on the wallet card. Fee = $154.00. Please note that the Board does not automatically mail renewal forms or notices to nurs- es whose licenses are due for renewal. We encourage all nurses to consider going online to apply for renewal. We think you will be surprised at how easy it is.Page 4 - Iowa Board of Nursing Newsletter - May, June, July 2011 LPN SUPERVISION IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES In order for an LPN to supervise in an intermediate or skilled health care facility, the LPN MUST satisfactorily com- plete the board approved LPN Supervisory Course within six (6) months of employment in the supervisory role. The course is designed specifically for the supervision role in the long term care patient setting. A board approved nursing program or an approved provider of continuing education must provide the course. The area community colleges offer courses. It is the responsibility of the licensed practical nurse to maintain his or her certificate documenting completion of the course. A licensed practical nurse is entitled to supervise without the educational requirement outlined above if the licensed practical nurse was performing in a supervisory role on or before October 6, 1982. Verification is required. If licensees are unable to obtain the course within the first six months of employment, the LPN must write to the Board explaining the reason a waiver of the LPN Supervisory Course is being requested. Licensed practical nurses who are enrolled full-time in a registered nurse program are not exempt from the course. However, an LPN who is a full-time student in an RN program and who is scheduled to graduate within one year, may request a waiver by writing to the board office. The request for a waiver must state the number of credit hours to be taken each semester and include the student's expected date of graduation. Individuals who do not graduate from the RN program as scheduled or who are not successful on the RN-NCLEX\u00aemust take the next available course.NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT The Iowa Board of Nursing is pleased to be a member of the nurse licensure compact. This new form of licensure and regulation will better protect the public by: Allowing competent nurses to provide care both physical- ly and electronically wherever care is needed; Providing the public ready access to and a choice of qual- ified nurses; Protecting clients against incompetent nurses or unsafe nursing care through better communication between boards of nursing, cooperative disciplinary investigations and prompt reporting of disciplinary action; Benefiting employers of nurses by having a more mobile workforce and a convenient centralized database for verifica- tion of licensure credentials. Understanding the Basics The nurse licensure compact allows a nurse who resides in a compact state to hold ONE license in the nurse's primary state of residence and practice in all other states in which the compact is in effect. Primary state of residence is where the nurse holds a driver's license, pays taxes and/or votes. The compact requires the nurse to practice according to the laws and regulations of the state in which the nurse provides care where the patient is located at the time the care is provided. The practice laws and regulations for many states are available online. A nurse who is under discipline may be in a monitoring agreement, which restricts practice across state lines. If you hold a license in a COMPACT state and RESIDE in that COMPACT state, your license is a multistate license which authorizes you to practice in any other compact state.If you hold a license in a COMPACT state, but do not RESIDE in that compact state (reside in a non-compact state), your license is a single state license and it authorizes you to practice only in that compact state. For example, if you hold an Iowa nursing license, but do not live in Iowa, the license is a single state license and does not grant you the privilege to practice in any other state. If you are licensed in both Iowa and another compact state and RESIDE in the other compact state, your Iowa nurs- ing license will be administratively placed on inactive status immediately. Only one active license can be held by a licens- ee among the compact states. The compact does not supersede federal law. There- fore if you are employed in military service or work for the federal government, you may continue to hold a nursing license in any state you choose. If you are working as a nurse in a nongovernmental capacity, you are required to contact the state board of nursing in that state to determine if a nurs- ing license is required. If you move from one compact state to another com- pact state and practice nursing, you must obtain a license in your new home state. However, you may continue to prac- tice under the former home state license and the multistate licensure privilege in the new home state for a period not t o exceed 30 da ys. a. The 30-days shall begin with the date of hire/employment in the new primary state of resi- dence. b. If the licensee begins employment before changing primary state of residence, the 30-days begins upon the date that the licensee establishes the new pri- mary state of residence.

The course must have been completed within the last 5 years. A list of approved courses is available at www.idph.state.ia.us/bh/abuse_ed_review.aspAGENDAS AND MINUTES ON THE WEB All Board and Committee agendas are on our web- site. Agendas are posted at least 48 hours in advance of a meeting. Previous agendas will remain posted until replaced by the current agendas. Board and Committee minutes are posted at our website approx- imately three (3) months following the meetings. You can reach our Agendas and Minutes at our website, w ww.iowa.go v/nursing , under \"About the Board. \"AL TERNATE METHODS TO VERIFY A NURSING LICENSE Employers/Public (No Charge) If you or your organization needs to verify a nurse license status and/or check a nurse's discipline status for employ- ment decisions, then you may want to consider the National Council of State Boards of Nursing's secure, online verification system, Nur sys\u00ae(www.nursys.com). The nursys.com Web site contains data obtained directly from the licensure systems of multiple boards of nursing through frequent, secured updates. Employers and the general public can now verify licenses and receive a detailed report within minutes, free of charge. This report will contain the name, jurisdiction(s), license type, license number(s), compact status (multistate/single state), license status, expiration date, discipline against license and discipline against privilege to practice (PTP) of the nurse being verified. Currently, nursys.com is the only verification tool available that provides status of a multistate licensee's privilege to practice in remote Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC) jurisdictions. Nurses (Official License Verification for a Fee) When a nurse applies for endorsement into a state, verifi- cation of existing or previously held licenses may be required. A nurse can use Nursys.com to request verification of licen- sure from a Nur syslicensure participating board. A list of licensure participating nursing boards can be found at Nursys.com. In order to be eligible for a multistate license in the Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC), the nurse must legally reside in an NLC state. An active, unencumbered, multistate license allows the nurse to practice in all NLC jurisdictions. Ques- tions about NLC eligibility and legal residency can be direct- ed to the board of nursing in the nurse's state of residency. Verifications can be processed by completing the online Nur sysverification process. The fee for this service is $30.00 per license type for each state board of nursing where the nurse is applying. Nur syslicense verification is sent to the endorsing board immediately. Please visit w ww.nursy s.com for more details.
