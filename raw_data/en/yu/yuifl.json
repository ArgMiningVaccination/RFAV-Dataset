(See \"Library Automation in K-12, a 2006 Update-Part 1\"; MULTIMEDIA & INTERNET@ SCHOOLS, September/October 2006.) Now, in Part 2 of the 2006 update, I'll introduce Softlink and provide news since my earlier coverage of Follett Corp.-in- cluding its acquisition of Sagebrush's library automa- tion products-SirsiDynix, and Mandarin Library Au- tomation, Inc. Also see the sidebar, What's Happening to the Rest of Sagebrush? on page 32. But first to Softlink. Softlink So what is Softlink? The company has a 23-year history in the design and support of its library au-tomation software. Softlink automation systems are used in more than 108 countries. Somewhat new to the U.S. school market, the Softlink Oliver system allows either a stand-alone or a district automation solution. Oliver is a highly customizable, totally Web- based, integrated automation system. What makes Oliver special? Search capabilities. Oliver supports Boolean, proximity, left and right truncation, bracketing, and results-set searching. Guided and Advanced searching screens are available to help novice users carry out complex searches.

RECONNECTING WITH FOLLETT, SIRSIDYNIX, AND MANDARIN LIBRARY AUTOMATION Follett Corp. The big news in July was Follett's acquisition of Sagebrush Library Automation Software. While it was too early for them to talk about their long-term plans for these products, Follett said it intends to provide its new Sagebrush customers with superior service for the foreseeable future and that the company is committed to keeping the Sagebrush customers informed about any future changes or transitions. (For news of the Sagebrush automation products, see my section on Sagebrush in Part 1 of the library automation update series in the September/October 2006 issue of MMIS.) Sales of Follett's browser-based Destiny Library Manager and Destiny Textbook Manager increased in the 2005-2006 school year 300 percent over the previ- ous school year. The 6.5 version update was released in July. My former M.L.I.S. students who are using Destiny in their schools report that they are very hap- py with the automation system. Focusing on the changing needs of K-12 education, Follett sees the need for information management, notjust library automation. Follett has identified the school library media specialist evolving into the infor- mation advocate/manager of the school, working with students and teachers to put quality information at the fingertips of the learner. Providing age- and ability-ap- propriate, standards-linked materials to support learn- ers and teachers is the new challenge. Follett is focus- ing on being a partner with education, helping in de- veloping prescriptions to meet the diverse learner needs as both traditional and digital education envi- ronments evolve. SirsiDynix SirsiDynix was in partnership with Sagebrush Li- brary Automation for the Athena product. Since Fol- lett acquired the Sagebrush automation holdings, Sir- siDynix has severed that partnership and launched a new K-12 initiative. I visited with Chuck Leachman, who leads the SirsiDynix K-12 team that is charged with delivering innovative solutions to the K-12 mar- ket. He told me Horizon has been designed specifical- ly to meet the workflow needs of the K-12 market with better, more intuitive interfaces. However, it is the SchoolRooms portal that has the K-12 SirsiDynix team excited. Developed in a collab- orative effort with INFOhio, the Information Network for Ohio Schools, SchoolRooms is a comprehensive and integrated multimedia online discovery portal for K-12 schools. This portal allows students and parents to ac- cess selected, standards-based content. Teachers, media specialists, and other educators create the vir- tual Rooms to meet national and state education stan- dards by discipline, providing content in context. The SirsiDynix K-12 team's goal is to help K-12 clients un- derstand how the SchoolRooms portal can facilitate a more collaborative relationship among all interested parties: students, teachers, and parents. November/ December 2006 MULTIMEDIA & INTERNET@SCHOOLS 31 Company Product Follett Corp. Destiny http:/Ifsc.foiletIt.Co and now: InfoCentre Accent Mandarin www.softlinkint.com Figure I Mandarin Library Automation, Inc. The offering of Mandarin M3 for a free download be- ginning February 2005 is continuing. This offer has been a big success, making automation financially available to small libraries of many kinds. An annual Service & Update Agreement (SUA) for Mandarin M3 is available for $575 per site. This is well within the budget limitations of most libraries. M3 is a fully func- tioning, stand-alone system. The Web-based Mandarin Oasis offers complete au- tomation functions from a single screen. Brought to market in early 2005, there has been continued devel- opment of the system. New upgrades allow deep link- ing with perpetual links, enhanced OPAC features, eas- ier import and export, and an upgraded reports func- tion that allows printable PDFs. New system include Man- darin's PACPortal (OPAC with federated search) and the Pocket Module with Windows Mobile (which offers six primary functions-Loan, Return, Reserve, Renew, In-House Circulation, and Inventory). Both M3 and Oasis are SIF-compliant applications, which allow M3 and Oasis to interact with other student data applications. It also enables the creation of power- ful reports by accessing data from different applications. With M3 or Oasis, you can configure which applications you want to have communication privileges with. Mandarin will go live with a new Web site during the first quarter of 2007. Both M3 and Oasis will con- tinue to be supported and developed. Future software improvements will include increased wireless envi- ronment capability.Sagebrush Books, Sagebrush Library Services, and Sagebrush Viewpoint have not disappeared from the marketplace. They form the core of a new company named Savia LLC. Savia is focusing on the expansion of the Sagebrush Book and Library services. Their full-service book business includes a user- friendly Web site, dynamic state-standard alignments, a long history of cataloging and processing for school libraries, and a staff of experienced M.L.S.-degreed library profes- sionals available to assist libraries with col- lection development. Savia plans to make Sagebrush Books better than ever. The book company facilities in Caledonia, Minn., will remain in operation with the same staff as before the sale of Sagebrush Automation. Savia is also focusing on the growing field of school data management with its informa- tion management product Viewpoint.
