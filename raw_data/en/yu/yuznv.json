Setting To set the stage for activities in observance of the International Year of Pulses 2016, declared by the 68th session of the UN General Assembly, FAO's Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, in collaboration with the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT)and the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), organizeda regional consultation from 29 to 30 June 2015 in Bangkok, Thailand. The theme of the meetingwas \"Promotion of Pulses for Multiple Benefits in Asia.\" A total of 39 participants from 13 countries- Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Lao PDR, Republic ofKorea, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand - attended the meeting in addition to FAOofficials and senior scientists from ICRISAT and ICARDA. Hiroyuki Konuma, Assistant Director-General, FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, in his opening address highlighted the important contribution that pulse crops have made and willcontinue to make to achieving food and nutrition security for the millions of people living in theAsian region. Konuma stressed that pulses are inextricably linked with the culture, beliefs andeconomy of the region. Pulses are also an integral part of Asian farming systems with directinvolvement of women farmers. Konuma highlighted the relevance and timeliness of theconsultation as a backdrop to declaring 2016 the \"Year of Pulses\" and said collaboration of ICRISATand ICARDA, both involved in the field of pulses, highlights the importance of working togetherboth regionally and nationally to provide support to the millions of pulse growers in the region. He pointed out that pulse farming is being pushed out to more marginal and non-productive lands due to conflicts with competing crops such as rice and wheat and thus production of pulsesremains low. The price of pulses is at least three times higher than rice and wheat. The removal of pulses from age old cropping patterns is also believed to be one of the reasons for low productivity of soils. Being a crop of rainfed areas, pulses are also highly vulnerable tonatural disasters and climate change. Therefore, effects of the changing environmental conditionson pulses have a greater impact on this crop, he said. Four experts presented papers covering scientific and technical aspects of pulse cultivation such as research, development and outreach activities; impact of climate change and the importanceof pulses for providing nutritional security. Outputs gathered from technical presentations, countryreports, group discussions and open discussions were used in drafting the recommendations ofthe meeting. B. Recommendations 1. Mobilize adequate government support and advocacy in support of policy formulation, institutional arrangements and research and development (R&D) of pulses with anemphasis on inclusion of pulses in cropping systems aimed at enhancing food andnutrition security.Executive summaryProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits viii2. Enhance funding of pulse research programmes, strengthen infrastructure and develop human resources, modernize research programmes with the use of genomic resources,bioinformatics and other modern tools and advanced methods. 3. Conduct research for development of labour-saving technologies (varieties suitable for machine harvesting, herbicide resistance); tools/machines to enhance mechanization;varieties and technologies for boosting resilience to climate change, enhancing nutritionalquality attributes (protein, minerals, vitamins) and reducing anti-nutritional factors (phytate,RFOs, etc.). 4. In view of the markets for pulses being thin and fragmented, undertake a range of measures to improve market functions and the supply chain for pulses, including providingmarket intelligence and increased support to market chain development and R&D onvalue-added products with a focus on building adequate storage, grading, milling, andsecondary processing facilities. 5. Taking into account the high vulnerability of pulse crops to both biotic (pests and diseases) and abiotic stresses (temperature extremes and aberrant rainfall driven by climate change),design and implement appropriate crop insurance schemes as a hedge against cropfailures. 6. Improve economic attractiveness of cultivation of pulse crops through provision of incentives to famers, such as competitive pric e support through government procurement programmes, low-interest credit, and provision of subsidies on pulse-specific inputs. 7. Undertake focused extension efforts for popularization and expansion of pulse cultivation - strengthening linkages between research and out-scaling, village-level quality seedproduction by farmers and farmers' associations in addition to formal seed production; creating hubs for custom hiring of farm machineries by small and marginal farmers; ensuring participation of various stakeholders in consultation meetings, etc. 8. Conduct farmer-participatory trials to promote adoption of improved cultivars and technologies, including integrated crop management (ICM) practices along with theprovision of input supplies. Develop and strengthen sustainable community-based seedproduction systems. 9. Where appropriate policies and capacities exist for the enforcement of biosafety guidelines for confined testing and environmental release, consider undertaking research onGenetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in pulses. 10. To sustain continued focus on pulses, ensure the flow of international funding support for pulse R&D and exchange of information and experience, establish regional, inter-countrynetworks in R&D; conduct periodic meetings to secure support from FAO, UN bodies, CGCentres, and other development partners. 11. Establish a Legume Asia Network (LAN) to facilitate sharing of germplasm/breeding materials, information and also to develop joint projects for funding. 12. Undertake educational and training programmes to create awareness among school children (include in school curriculum), farmers and extension personnel the value ofpulses (human, animal and soil health) and its human health benefits. 13. Consider incorporating pulses as an essential ingredient in national food security programmes like mid-day meals etc. 14. Upgrade the value chain of pulses through (a) promotion of technology (post-harvest storage and milling, ICT for access to information, mechanization); (b) organizingsmallholder producers (contract farming, farmer motivation, curtailing middlemanExecutive summary ixinvolvement in the marketing chain); (c) improving market information drawing on the study of different types of pulse value chains including indigenous value chains in theregion.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits xI. Inaugural session 11Following the opening address by Hiroyuki Konuma, Assistant Director-General, FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, M.S. Swaminathan, a renowned Indian geneticist, well-knowninternationally for his leading role in India's Green Revolution, delivered the keynote speech. Professor Swaminathan explained that an increase in the production of protein-rich pulses such as lentils, chickpeas and other varieties could help feed the world as the global population isexpected to surpass nine billion by 2050, and thus contribute to meeting the Zero HungerChallenge introduced by the UN Secretary-General in 2012. Climate smart agricultural approacheswould be necessary and make more efficient use of water to achieve 'more crop per drop.' Headded that policy makers would also need to play a critical role to assist smallholders throughremunerative price support and assured markets. Subash Dasguptma, in stating the meeting objectives and programme, informed participants that from time immemorial people in many societies across Asia, Africa and Latin America grew pulsesin their farming systems in a number of ways - as a rotation crop with staple cereals in the cropfield, on field margins, as hedge crops in agro-forestry systems and in homestead backyards. InSouth Asia, pulses come next only to rice and wheat in importance as food, reflected in the termdal-bhat (pulse-rice), which resonates well in people's consciousness as the foundation of food and nutritional security. Pulse crops gradually lost their competitive edge, diminishing their prospectfor sole cultivation as a commercial crop. Food security, in essence, turned into security in basiccereals creating a gaping hole in intake of essential nutrients, particularly by poor and low-incomehouseholds. Although food security for some countries, by and large, is within reach, achievingnutritional security still remains a distant elusive goal. Many countries have started attempts to reverse this scenario by rearranging research priorities and allocating budgets for research and development in pulses. Modern high-yielding varietieshave been developed for major pulse crops such as chickpea, pigeonpea, mungbean, lentil, fieldpea and other crops. These varieties are yet to reach farmers' fields and they have to be adaptedto the impacts of climate change, notably high temperatures above normal that prevailing duringthe pulse growing season. Although South Asia remains the largest producer and consumer ofpulses in the world, none of these countries is anywhere closer to achieving self-sufficiency inpulses and they have to import substantial quantities to meet their demand for pulses. Thescenario is similar in East Asia, where domestic production of pulses meets only a fraction of thedemand. In spite of their huge advantage, the area, production and productivity of pulse crops has been decreasing over the past decade. A reduction in the production and productivity of pulses is nota good sign. It has resulted in increased imports and affected the nutritional food security ofpoverty-stricken people, which is further deteriorating as per caput availability of pulses isshrinking. The pulse production scenario must be changed urgently and a strategy for meeting thefuture demand of pulses should be developed giving emphasis to research, resource availabilityand technology transfer.I. Inaugural sessionProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 2Keynote speech Pulses and the zero hunger challenge Professor M.S. SwaminathanUNESCO Chair in Ecotechnology, MSSRF , Chennai, India Introduction The Zero hunger challenge rests on five pillars - 100 percent access to adequate food all yearround, zero stunted children less than 2 years of age, all food systems are sustainable, 100 percentincrease in smallholder productivity and income, zero loss or waste of food (Ban Ki-moon, UNSecretary-General). The three major dimensions of hunger are calorie deprivation, proteindeficiency and micronutrient deficiency. The M.S. Swaminathan Foundation has developed theconcept of farming systems for nutrition (FSN) to address the issue of eradication of hunger. FSNinvolves the introduction of agricultural remedies to the nutritional maladies prevailing in an areathrough the mainstreaming of nutritional criteria in the selection of the components of a farmingsystem involving crops like pulses, farm animals and, where feasible, fish. While finalizing thecomponents of a farming system, the gender and age dimensions of human nutritional needs arekept in view, such as the special needs of pregnant women and nursing mothers, and new bornbabies during the first 1 ,000 days after birth. Biofortified crops are introduced in FSN, wherever available. The introduction of FSN paves the road to sustainable agriculture. Among the crops, pulses are a relatively cheap and affordable source of protein and other nutrients that can play an important role in providing nutritional security for countries with a sizeablepopulation living at or below the national poverty lines. India is the world's largest producer andconsumer of pulses. Pakistan, Canada, Myanmar, Australia and the United States of America (USA),in that order, are significant exporters and are India's most significant suppliers. Canada nowaccounts for approximately 35 percent of annual global pulse trade. The global pulse market isestimated at 60 million tonnes. The major pulse crops of India, in order of importance, in area under pulses in India follows a positive trend with considerable year-to-year fluctuations. Between1980/81 and 2012/13, the total cropped area under pulses increased from 22.46 million hectares(mha) to 23.47 mha with the peak 26.40 mha attained in 2010/11. Growth in production of pulsesover this period was increasing faster from 10.63 mha in 1980/81 to 18.34 mha in 2012/13 drivenprimarily by an increase in yield from 473 kg/ha to 781 kg/ha over this period. Despite the increases, average pulse yields in India are much lower than the world average. The Government of India provides policy support in the form of minimum support prices to farmersin order to boost pulse production (Figure 1). The government has recently announced a bonusof Rs. 200 per quintal (100 kg) of pulses produced in order to provide an incentive to farmers.Maintaining a sustainable growth in productivity and production of pulses is an important priorityof the government given a stagnant scenario of per capita net availability of pulses (Figure 2).I. Inaugural session 3To meet the persistent deficit of domestic production of pulses, India imports about 4 million tonnes of pulses annually from various sources - yellow/green peas from Canada and Russia, chickpeas from Australia, lentils from Canada, green and blackgrams from Myanmar andpigeonpeas from Myanmar, Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawi. Farming system for nutrition: components Cropping of greengram Intercrop of cotton and pigeonpea Overcoming protein hunger As was the case with grain cereals, a revolution is needed to stimulate a sustainable long-term growth in productivity and production of pulses capitalizing on opportunities for both vertical andhorizontal expansion. To drive home this point, the FAO has declared 2016 as the International Yearof Pulses. The use of modern technologies of plant breeding remains the key to addressing thischallenge. The technological platform rests on the following: Development of high-yielding improved cultivars of major pulse crops. Increased use of the tools and methods of precision breeding. Use of genome sequence data of chickpea ( Cicer arietinum ) improvement. Marker-assisted breeding. genomics Exploring the CRISPR system. It is a prokaryotic adaptive immune system that uses a RNA guided nuclease/Cas9 (isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes ) to silence viral nucleic acids. Recently it has been engineered for genome editing.Figure 1. Trend in minimum support prices for pulses Figure 2.

Cas9 nuclease makes a double-strand break in DNA at a site-determined by a short20 nucleotide guide RNA. Advantages of the CRISPR gene editing technology Targeted mutagenesis/non-GMO. Desired mutations at intended, specific loci. Multiplex genome editing can be achieved. End-product is often indistinguishable from conventional mutation breeding. More efficient screening and breeding (homozygous mutant plants can be achieved in T2 generation). More importantly, no foreign DNA will be present in the plant genome (foreign DNA willbe eliminated in subsequent generation). Improving soybean oil quality through a precise genome engineering approach Soybean oil is high in polyunsaturated fat (PUF) and is often partially hydrogenated toincrease its shelf life and improve oxidative quality. The trans fat produced through hydrogenation pose a health threat. Consuming trans fat increases low-density lipoprotein (LDL or bad cholesterol), whichcontributes to the leading cause of coronary heart disease. Soybean lines that are low PUFs were gener ated by introducing specific mutations using TALENs acid desaturase genes ( FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B ). Examples of genes that could be targeted for pulse improvement using a genome engineering approach Creation of disease tolerant genotypes (e.g. mutations in Mildew Resistance Locus O (MLO) genes for powdery mildew resistance, a common fungal disease in pulses. Improving pulse seed quality by targeting antinutrients. Example: Reducing phytic acidcontent by targeted disruption of phytic acid pathway. Generation of abiotic stress tolerant crops. Enhancing pulse production in India: challenges Achieve production at 32 million tonnes by 2030. Close the gap between demand andsupply. Bringing an additional 3-5 million hectares under pulse cultivation. Doubling the yield from 700 kg/ha. Strategies for enhancing pulses production Widen the genetic base Characterize genetic resources of pulses using molecular and taxonomical tools. Undertake prebreeding using exotic, landraces and wild species to create widevariability for plant types, disease and pest resistance and abiotic stress tolerance.I. Inaugural session 5 Expand area of pulses Promote pulses cultivation in rice-fallows through introducing short-duration varieties of pulses as a main/catch crop. Enhance adoption of improved cultivars Promote farmer-participatory varietal selection trials (FPVS). Climate smart agricultural practices Grown in rainfed conditions in marginal lands by small and marginal farmers. Farmer producer company. Ensure conservation and equitable sharing of water resources. Value chain-based Integrated Crop Management - Soil Health and Biological softwarefor sustainable agriculture. Knowledge management (ICT) Knowledge development and dissemination through Village Knowledge Centers usingICT tools. Farmers Field Schools/Farmers Plant Clinics/Pulse Entitlement Cards/Technical flyers- Mass dissemination. Post-harvest - storage, processing and value addition, branding and marketing Implemented through Farmer Organizations. Establishment of Pulses Panchayats. Linkages with financial institutions for input, credit procurement, value addition,branding and marketing. Monsoon and agriculture Promote community or individual rainwater harvesting and conservation in farm ponds.Community conservation and use will require assurance of equity in sharing the harvestedwater. The conserved water will help to provide crop life-saving irrigation when and whereneeded. Establishment of seed bank which will provide seeds of the same or alternate crops, in casethere is early withdrawal of monsoon or the inter-spell duration is long. In rainfed areas, farmers can take to the cultivation of climate smart pulses, millets andoilseeds so that some income accrues even under conditions of uncertain rainfall. Arrangements for suitable agricultural machinery which can help to prepare the soilspeedily for sowing. This is particularly important in the heavy black cotton soils of centralIndia. Strategies to improve pulse productivity and production Develop short-duration, high-yielding varieties. Develop varieties with improved drought tolerance. Expand new niches - chickpea in rice fallows. Introduce pigeonpea in rice wheat cropping systems. Improve seed systems through creating seed villages. Improve input supply, micronutrients and fertilizer. Introduce crop life-saving irrigation. Introduce mechanization. Provide remunerative support price and assured marketing.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 6II. Technical session 77A. Summary of technical papers Pooran M. Gaur from the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) presented a paper titled \"Research, development and outreach activities for enhancing pulseproduction in Asia\" . The paper focused on opportunities that Asian countries can take advantageof in boosting productivity and production of pulses. The emphasis was on futher developmentof improved cultivars and production technologies to cope with the emerging challenges ofsustaining production of pulses in farming systems of Asian countries. Gaur identified restructuring of plant types of pulse crops as it was accomplished with cereals as a major technological option to break new ground in elevating the yield potential of pulses.Distinct plant types need to be developed to suit both irrigated and rainfed growing conditions.Currently available improved varieties tailored to rainfed cropping and minimum application ofexternal inputs respond poorly to a high level of fertilization and irrigation. The new varietiesshould also have erect to semi-erect plant stature to allow mechanized harvesting given the high cost and relative scarcity of human labour. To cope with anticipated negative impacts of climate change, there is a need to develop climate- smart varieties that are endowed with improved capacity f or recovery after exposure to stress. In essence, this means varieties with enhanced tolerance to a range of abiotic (high temperature anddrought, waterlogging, soil salinity) and biotic stresses (insect-pests and diseases) the severity ofwhich may be enhance, with the progress of climate change. The presenter highlighted the options for breeding new varieties of pulses with improved traits. Hybrid technology has become feasible in pigeonpeas. Recently released hybrids of pigeonpeasin India have demonstrated a 30-40 percent yield advantage in farmers' fields. Pod borer continuesto remain a major and challenging insect-pest of pulses. It has not been possible to developvarieties with high levels of resistance to pod borer due to the non-availability of sources with highlevels of resistance in the germplasm of cultivated species. In this respect, wild species of pulsesand transgenics need to be exploited in breeding programmes to improve pod borer resistance. Wide variation has been observed for iron and zinc content in the germplasm, which can be exploited for developing high iron and zinc varieties. This would allow a higher amount of proteinand other nutrients from the same amount of pulses consumed. Early/extra-early maturity is animportant trait for breeding pulse varieties suitable for expanding cultivation of pulses in non-traditional seasons or between two cereal crops as catch crop. One of the constraints in growing pulses in rainfed rice-fallows is crop establishment. Current field preparation methods lead to losses of moisture. Thus, sowing pulses in rice-fallows has to be donewith minimum or zero tillage. The agronomic practices need to be standardized including seedpriming and seed treatment with fungicides/insecticides, application of rhizobium inoculant, andsowing method (relay cropping, seed dibbling and sowing with zero till seed drill).II. Technical sessionProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 8In his presentation, Gaur stressed the application of novel methods and tools in breeding programmes and the use of controlled environment facilities (green houses, growth chambers) forrapid generation advancement of breeding materials and phenotyping platforms for highthroughput screening of genetic materials and use of electronic field books and data managementsystems for increasing efficiency. There has been rapid progress in the development of low costgenotyping platforms and genomic resources in recent years. The draft genome sequence is nowavailable for most of the pulses. Integrated breeding involving genomic approaches needs to beused for higher precision and efficiency of breeding programmes. A strategy was outlined for outreach activities with available improved cultivars and technologies. This consisted of (1) promoting pulse cultivation in rice-fallows; (2) bringing additional area underpulses through intercropping and sequential cropping; (3) promoting the ridge and furrow methodof planting pulses in the rainy season; (4) integrated nutrient management; (5) promoting micro-irrigation; (6) integrated pest management; (7) faster mechanization of pulse cultivation, (8) policysupport and (9) further strengthening of collaboration among Asian countries for developmentand exchange of technologies on pulses. P .S. Basu from the ICAR-Indian Institute of Pulses Research presented a paper titled \"Impact of climate change on pulses development in Asia.\" The paper explored the impacts of climate changeprimarily in the context of rainfed cultivation which is being increasingly exposed to highertemperatures. The deficit of soil moisture further amplifies the impact and as a result potentialyields of most pulses are reduced. The majority of pulse growing countries like India, Pakistan,Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand are particularly vulnerableto the impacts of climate change due to their strategic geographical locations in the mid-northlatitude nearer to the equator where maximum threshold temperature for tolerance of pulses hasalready reached 35\u00baC. A further rise in temperature, as it is evident now, will adversely affect theproductivity of pulses in these areas. Increased CO 2 level in the atmosphere is not beneficial for pulses grown under a stressful the environment. Both drought and heat are recurrent phenomen in South and Southeastern Asian countries. Gene mining for stress tolerance from diverse germplasm collections, including wild species will remainthe great strength for evolving newer varieties tolerant to multiple abiotic stresses. Themechanisms of heat and drought tolerance Drought-specificgenes, Dreb 1A, drought-tolerant chickpea andpigeonpea. Drought-specific signal molecules ABA and its role in drought tolerance have beencharacterized. Identification of linked quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for root and high yield andmarker-assisted selection (MAS) have opened new horizons in the field of drought research. Rapid advancements in genomics provide an opportunity of molecular mapping of QTL controlling heat tolerance and using marker-assisted breeding for development of heat tolerant varieties withsuitable agronomic background and desired seed traits. Molecular markers will be soon availablefor major heat tolerance QTL in some legumes which will further facilitate breeding for heat anddrought tolerance. Root-based traits are being used to improve drought tolerance in major pulsecrops. However, yield stability of pulses requires less genotype \u00d7 environment interaction and wider adaptability across the environment. The physiological trait such as water use efficiency isconsidered to be the most important to contribute to grain yield and biomass under droughtcondition. A large pool of pulse germplasm is available which needs to be evaluated for droughttolerance and high water-use efficiency. Jagdish Singh and N.P . Singh from the Indian Institute of Pulses Research presented a paper titled \"Importance of pulses as a source of nutrition in the Asian region\" . In their presentation, theauthors focused on the unique nutritional profile of pulses - low-fat source of digestible protein,II. Technical session 9(typically contain about twice the amount of protein found in whole grain cereals like wheat, oats, barley and rice), dietary fibre (containing both soluble and insoluble fibres), complex carbohydrates,resistant starch and low glycemic index and a number of essential vitamins and minerals such asiron, potassium, magnesium, zinc and selenium. Pulse carbohydrates are slowly digested which allows some of the lowest Glycemic Index (GI) among carbohydrate-containing foods. Pulse GI typically range from about 29 to 48 (using glucoseas the standard). The relatively slow digestibility and hence low GI of pulses has been attributedto several constituents, including carbohydrate composition, protein content and protein-starchmatrix, and antinutrient factors such vitaminsincluding vitamin B9 (folate), thiamin and niacin. In addition to contributing to a healthy, balanceddiet, pulses contain a number of phytates, oligosaccharides, and phenolic compounds which makes them particularlyhelpful in the fight against some non-communicable diseases often associated with diet transitionsand rising incomes. Enzyme inhibitors can diminish protein digestibility, and lectins can reduce nutrient absorption, but both have little effect after cooking. Phytic acid can diminish mineral bioavailability. Somephenolic compounds can reduce protein digestibility and mineral bioavailability, andgalactooligosaccharides may cause flatulence. On the other hand, the same compounds may haveprotective effects. Phytic acid exhibits antioxidant activity and protects against DNA damage,phenolic compounds have antioxidant and other important physiological and biological properties,and galactooligosaccharides may elicit prebiotic activity. Encouraging awareness of the nutritionalvalue of pulses can help consumers adopt healthier diets and also could be an important dietaryfactor in improving longevity. B. Summary of country reports Bangladesh Major pulse crops grown in Bangladesh are grass peas, lentils, mungbeans, blackgrams andchickpeas. They occupy about 93 percent of the total pulse area and contribute 97 percent to totalproduction. The area, production and yield of different pulse crops in Bangladesh exhibiteda declining trend over the period 1985-2005. The total area under pulse cultivation dropped from734 ,500 ha to 275 ,300 ha (37.5 percent) over the period 1985/90-2005/06 and production fell from 510,520 tonnes to 208 ,500 tonnes (41 percent) during this period. The main reasons for the decline of pulses is crop competition in Rabi season as well as yield instability of pulses due to biotic andabotic constraints. Cultivation of boro rice expanded to the areas growing grass peas, chickpeasand field peas in the medium low land, while wheat, potatoes, maize and vegetables have takenover the lands of lentils, mungbeans and blackgrams. The present cropping intensity is 190 percent and the scope of expansion for pulses as a sole crop is very limited. Therefore, the strategy for expansion of pulses cultivation should be built on(1) increasing productivity through adoption of improved varieties and cultural practices (verticalexpansion) and (2) increasing area through introduction of new cropping patterns and utilizationof fallow lands (horizontal expansion). Fifty-six varieties have been released by the national agricultural research system, most of which are high yielding and tolerant to major diseases and other stress factors. At research stationsthe yields of these varieties are high but in farmers' fields the yields are much lower. The seedyield of new lentil varieties ranged from 2 ,000 to 2 ,200 kg/ha at research stations and averagedProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 101,350 kg/ha at on-farm trials, whereas the national average yield of lentils is only 738 kg/ha, which is about one third of the potential yield. These varieties along with their production technologiesshould be extended to farmers to replace the low-yielding local cultivars, which will ultimatelyenhance productivity. Rabi pulses should be introduced as intercrop/mix crop/relay crop in the cropping system. Research should focus on developing disease resistant, short-duration and high yielding varietiesthat are suitable for existing cropping patterns. To popularize improved pulse varieties, productiontechnology and technical support should be extended to farmers. Bhutan The Kingdom of Bhutan is a small landlocked mountainous country located on the southern slopes of the Eastern Himalayas and surrounded by two giant countries - China in the north and India inthe south. According to the Bhutan Land Cover Assessment 2010, only 2.93 percent of the country's total geographical area is cultivated agriculture land, of which 61.9 percent (69 670.79 ha) is dryland, 27.9 percent (31 361.23 ha) is wetland (irrigated paddy field) and 10.2 percent (11 524.19 ha)is horticultural land. The average cultivated agriculture landholding is about 3 acres (RNR statistics,2012). Pulses or grain legumes have played and will continue to play a diverse role in Bhutanesefarming systems, e.g. as a food crop through direct consumption as grain, green pod and leavesthereby contributing towards food security and dietary diversity goal, as a cash crop through sales,which helps reduce poverty and as fodder crop, thereby contributing to livestock productivity andas a rotation crop. They are grown in diverse land use systems, but more than 75 percent of thenational legumes or pulses are grown on dry lands (National Legumes Survey, 1999). While thesurvey of 1999 has recorded 16 species, the most widely grown pulse species in Bhutan legumes are either intercropped with maize or mono cropped as a succeeding crop following crop rotation. Unlikein maize, in rice-based systems, legume crops, largely urd beans, are planted along the terracebunds following the paddy transplantation. Cambodia The major food legume crops grown in Cambodia are mungbeans, soybeans and peanuts. Theresults of recent research conducted by the Cambodian Agricultural Research and DevelopmentInstitute (CARDI) indicated that mungbeans and peanuts were potentially high-yielding cropssuitable for growing on the sandy soil in the rainfed lowland areas after harvesting wet season CMB1, been released by CARDI since 2009 which are grown after harvesting wet season rice. These are short-duration varietiesrequiring 50-55 days from planting to the first harvest. Field demonstrations on integrated technology f or growing mung beans in sandy soil after wet season rice, including land preparation, planting techniques, application of recommended fertilizerrates, crop management and the released new variety were conducted from 2009 to 2014 in therainfed lowland areas following wet season rice in three provinces (Kampong Thom, Kampot, andTakeo). The results of field demonstrations showed that with the application of CARDI's technology package, farmers obtained an average 561 kg/ha grain yield of mungbeans. However, with propercrop management practices yields increased up to 1 ,062 kg/ha. The average grain yield was nearly double compared with only 275 kg/ha obtained using farmers' traditional practices. Similarly, grossincome also doubled to 2.93 million Riels/ha with the use of CARDI's technology compared with1.07 million Riels/ha obtained using traditional practices only.II. Technical session 11China China is one of the biggest producers of pulses in the world. Major pulse and food legume crops grown in the country are soybeans, broad beans, peas, chickpeas, lentils, common beans, cowpeas,adzuki beans, peanuts, pigeonpeas, mungbeans, lima beans, etc. China accounts for 39.7 percentof the global production of broad beans, 37.3 percent of peanuts, 60 percent of green peas, and75 percent of common beans (green). Except for soybeans and peas, average yields of most pulsesobtained in China are higher than the world average. The demand for pulse crops is projected to grow significantly along with the rising living standards of the people and increasing awareness about consumption of healthy food. Since China becamea member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, the import of soybeans and peas fromthe USA, Canada, Brazil and Argentina was increasing rapidly, which depressed the market priceof dry pulses. This has resulted in driving down the returns in domestic production of dry grainpulses and a decrease in the sown area and total production. At the same time, the increasingtrend of Chinese consumers to eat traditional food based on vegetable pulses, as well the asgrowing appreciation of health benefits of vegetable pulses has led to a sharp increase invegetable pulse production in China. This also benefits the cropping systems by reducing cropduration as pulses are grown for consumption as vegetables. In the future, pulse-based cropping systems that include dry pulse production will likely remain static or decline and the vegetable pulse production is likely to increase rapidly. Therefore, breedingresearch on genetic resources and genetic studies in China will be oriented to supportingvegetable pulse production and strengthened at national and provincial levels. India In India, over a dozen pulse crops including chickpeas, pigeonpeas, cowpeas, mungbeans, urdbeans, lentils, French beans, horse grams, field peas, moth beans, lathyrus, etc. are grown. However, the most important pulse crops are chickpeas (41 percent), pigeonpeas (15 percent), urdbeans(10 percent), mungbeans (9 percent), cowpeas (7 percent) lentils (5 percent) and field peas(5 percent). India has been a world leader in production as well as consumption of pulses. The country harvested a record 19.27 million tonnes of pulses in 2013-2014. Notwithstanding an impressivegrowth of pulse production in the country, import has also shown a positive trend over the years,while exports remained almost stagnant. The area under pulse cultivation in the country is estimated to be about 25-26 million hectares and realized productivity is less than 1 tonne/ha. Because major pulses are largely cultivated underrainfed and monsoon-dependent areas where soil moisture is the critical factor determining theproductivity, the production trends keep fluctuating every year depending upon rainfall. The majorconstraints to realization of potential yield of pulses include biotic and abiotic stresses prevalentin the pulse-growing areas besides socio-economic factors. The requirement of pulses has been projected to reach 32 million tonnes by 2050 taking into account the estimated growth of the population to 1.69 billion by 2050 and the availability ofprotein in diets from some other sources such as milk products. Reaching this goal requires theannual production of pulses to grow at 2.2 percent against the current growth rate of 3.5 percent.This target seems to be well within reach despite the myriad looming challenges such as climatechange-driven distribution of rainfall and temperatures , decreasing water and land resources, etc. A tangible step in this direction will be increasing the average productivity of pulses above1 ,200 kg/ha and bringing an additional area of about 3.5 mha under pulss cultivation. Reducing post-harvest losses by 10-15 percent from the current losses will also add another 1 mt of pulsegrains.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 12Vertical expansion of pulses in the country through yield enhancement can be achieved by development of input-responsive and climate-resilient varieties of pulses, varieties with multipleresistance to diseases and insect pests, short-duration varieties that fit well in different croppingsystems and increasing the harvest index. Similarly, development of new plant types for differentagro-climatic situations, and development of photo-thermo insensitive cultivars in crops like mungbeans and urdbeans will help expand the area of these crops in to non-traditional areas of thecountry. This will also help develop varieties that could perform equally well in different seasonsand locations. Indonesia Among the various pulses grown in the country, mungbeans ( Vigna radiata ) occupy the largest area followed by cowpeas and pigeonpeas. During the last seven years, the cropped area and grainproduction of pulses showed a decreasing trend. The area declined to 182 ,075 ha in 2013 from 306 ,207 ha in 2007. During this period, no significant change in productivity of pulses was observed with 1.109 tonnes/ha in 2013 as against 1.053 tonnes/ha in 2007. Research and development of pulses in Indonesia is still limited. The constraints to pulse development trace their origin to agro-ecological factors, production systems, farmers' socio-economic conditions, product development, and marketing. Breeding research on pulses inIndonesia is focused on developing and releasing new varieties with high yield potential forvarious sub-optimal agroecologies, early maturity, and resistance to pests and diseases. Researchon mungbeans attracts priority over other pulses. Because pulses are not considered a staple food,serious attention and efforts are needed to raise the status of pulses in Indonesia, which is nowconsidered a neglected crop. Opportunities for improving productivity and production of pulses lie in modernizing breeding programmes to develop and release new varieties, organizing quality seed production,implementation of the full recommended technology packages, and their rapid dissemination tofarmers. Post-harvest research, especially on the development of pulse-based food products,remains central to driving the market demand for pulses. The development of potential areasfor expanding pulse cultivation should be directed to provinces with the most favourableagro-ecological conditions, such as Bali, East Nusa Tenggara, Yogyakarta, West Java, Central Java,East Java, and South Kalimantan. Islamic Republic of Iran Chickpeas and lentils are the two major pulse crops grown in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Mostof the chickpea (97 percent) and lentil (94 percent) areas are planted under rainfed conditions andare grown in rotation with cereals, mainly wheat and barley. Beans, faba beans and mungbeans areplanted on about 150 ,000 ha under irrigated conditions in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The major constraints influencing the productivity of chickpeas and lentils include poor agronomic practices, drought, heat, ascochyta blight, fusarium wilt and cold. The agronomic practices forchickpea and lentil cultivation, including date of sowing, seed rate, method of sowing, plantpopulation, weed control, and method of harvesting have been researched and recommendationsdeveloped for different areas. Improved chickpea varieties (Dorsa, Sadri, Pak and Shekofe) were released inthe last decade. Efforts are being made to transfer these recommendations to farm level with thehelp of extension specialists. Research on exploration of the possibility of winter planting ofII. Technical session 13chickpeas and lentils in milder environments and entzari planting in harsh (severe cold) environments has yielded promising results. Transfer of these technologies to farmers is in progressand in some areas farmers are getting almost 50 percent or more productivity with the adoptionof winter- or entezari sowing. Research in pulses is conducted by DARI (Dryland Agricultural Research Institute) and SPII (Seed and Plant Improved Institute) in collaboration with otherresearch organizations in the Islamic Republic of Iran and with international research centres suchas ICARDA, ICRISAT and CIAT. Lao PDR Mungbeans, cowpeas, soybeans and peanuts are the most common grain legumes grown in LaoPDR. Farmers widely grow mungbeans in low-lying areas and mostly during the rainy season.Soybeans are grown in rainfed upland areas and irrigated lowland after harvesting rice. Peanutsare grown on sandy soil along the Mekong river bank and the banks of other major rivers. Theyare also grown, to some extent, in irrigated rice fields, most peanuts are grown in the dry season. Increases in pulse production are achieved through the promotion of short-duration pulse crops. A focused attention on Integrated Pest Management has also triggered interest and facilitated theincrease of productivity and production of pulses. Better access to water through irrigation andaccess to quality seeds and credit for growers also are critical factors to the development of pulseproduction. Currently, the Agricultural Research Center (ARC) under the National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute (NAFRI) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Lao PDR is conductingresearch on legumes such as germplasm collection and breeding, improving cultivation tehnologyand extension of legume cultivation. ARC has developed a breeding programme for high yield, early maturity varieties that show tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and are adaptated to a large spectrum of weatherconditions for peanuts, soybeans and mungbeans. ARC has promoted intercropping and croprotation systems on farmer field plots, including legumes (peanuts, soybeans and mungbeans) andmajor crops such as rice, maize and cassava. Also, the ARC has introduced soil nutrient improvmentpractices by using pigeonpeas as green manure. Myanmar Pulses are grown throughout Myanmar, but 92.0 perc ent of total pulses growing in the country are concentrated in the Ayeyarwaddy, Magwe, Pegu, Mandalay, Sagaing and Yangon regions. are mungbeans, blackgrams, pigeonpeas, chickpeas, soybeans,butterbeans, kidney beans, soybeans cowpeas. In general,pulses are mostly grown in two seasons: (i) monsoon season (May-July), and (ii) post-monsoonseason (October-December). Mungbeans, pigeon peas and soybeans grown in the monsoonseason, while blackgram, chickpeas, and cowpeas are grown during post-monsoon season. Andalso mungbeans are grown in the post-monsoon season after the rice harvest in the lower partof Myanmar. Production of major pulses is constrained by both biotic and abiotic stresses. In mungbeans and and leaf roller are among the biotic stresses. Pod borer ( Helicoverpa armigera ) infestation occurs every year throughout the growing season.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 14There are a number of technological options available for increasing the productivity and production of pulses. These use short-duration and high-yielding varieties with resistance todiseases and pests, improved varieties with drought tolerance, adoption of good cultural practices(pest and disease management, weed control methods) and introduction of new adapted cropvarieties, new cropping pattern for fallow land area and supplies of quality seed and improvedvarieties to farmers. Moreover, on-farm research and development programme can enhanceparticipation of farmers and securing their cooperation in improving pulse productivity andproduction. Nepal Grain legumes are grown mainly as a rainfed crop (dependent on residual soil moisture) both inthe terai and in the hills. Winter legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, and grasspeas are grown mainlyin the rice-based system of the terai and inner terai. Warm season grain legumes such as soybeans,blackgram, pigeonpeas and horse grams which are produced in the maize-based system of thehills. In the higher mountainous regions, peas and phaseolus beans are the two most importantsummer legumes. Winter grain legumes crops are grown dependent on residual soil moisture afterthe harvest of rice or seed broadcasted on standing rice about 7-15 days prior to rice harvest (relaycropping). Warm season grain legumes are grown during summer months (monsoon rain) in mono,mixed with maize/finger-millet or on paddy bund. Legume crops can be attractive commodities for Nepalese farmers to earn cash for better living conditions. Diverse climate and environmental conditions of Nepal offer opportunities for growingmany species of food legumes and these crops fit well in the Nepalese cropping systems prevailingin most of the agro-ecological zones and can be grown in various seasons (winter, spring andsummer seasons). The cultivation of lentils is increasing because of the increasing preference for its internal consumption and potential for export markets. Nepalese lentils are much in demand in theinternational market. Bangladesh, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Germany, Republic of Korea, UnitedKingdom (UK) and Indonesia are its major export markets. Soybeans are identified as an industrialcrop and important ingredient for the poultry industry. Pakistan Four major pulse crops - chickpeas commonly grown in Pakistan. Among these, chickpeas are the major winter food legume and mungbeans are the major summer legume.Chickpeas occupy 76 percent of the total pulses area contributing 73 percent to total productionand mungbeans occupy 12 percent of total pulses area contributing 14 percent to total pulsesproduction. More than 80 percent of pulses are grown in Punjab and the rest of the area is spreadin to other provinces. Th production of pulses can be increased by adopting high-yielding varieties and production technology developed through coordinated resear ch. Major outputs of the coordinated efforts was the release of 27 varieties of chickpeas, 11 of lentils, 15 of mungbeans and 7 of mashbeans forcommercial cultivation. Development of chickpea varieties resistant to blight ( Ascochyta rabiei) and release of short duration mung and mashbean varieties coupled with matching agro-technologiesbrought expansion in new niches and diversification in the existing cropping systems. There isgreat potential in central Punjab and Sindh to intercrop mungbeans with sugarcane. Similarly, shortduration varieties of mungbeans can be successfully grown as catch crop in rice-wheat croppingsystems to expand the area of cultivation and improve soil fertility. Development of high-yielding,II. Technical session 15early maturing and disease resistant genotypes along with viable seed production and dissemination systems will play a major role in pulse crop production in future. Republic of Korea The Republic of Korea is one of the most important pulse crop producing countries in Asia. Themost edible pulses grown in the Republic of Korea are soybeans, adzuki beans, mungbeans,cowpeas, common beans, and peas. About 89 pe rcent of the total pulse production in the Republic of Korea comes from soybeans. They are grown on a range of land types from the plains to themountainous regions. The cropped area remained fairly constant for all pulse crops between theearly 1970s and the late 1980s followed by a steady decline in subsequent years. Over the last 30 years, extensive breeding efforts to improve the yield led to higher production from less land depending on specific use. For example, even though the area of soybeancultivation decreased from 188 ,431 ha in 1980 to 85 ,270 ha in 2004, improved varieties such as Hwangkeumkong, Taekwangkong, Daewonkong, and Daepungkong for tofu and soy sauce allowedsoybean yields to increase. The major constraints to productivity are: limited size of land holding,condition of land, unfavourable weather conditions, and management. Pulse crops, considered aspoor-income crops, are grown mostly in the middle to high mountainous regions because theseareas are unfavourable for growing most other crops. As the total demand of pulse crops increases, researchers are currently working on the development of varieties to improve food quality in the Republic of Korea. There has been muchresearch associated with identification of important agronomic QTLs in soybean. Significantprogress has been made by institutes and universities in molecular marker development becausethey have great potential in improving breeding efficiency. In fact, with the advent of nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) technologies, the Republic of Korea has recently released the wholegenome sequence of mungbeans and adzuki beans that will be very useful in pulse crops breedingprogrammes. However, a combination of marketing and scientific approaches will still beinadequate to achieve 100 percent self-sufficiency in soybeans, mungbeans, adzuki beans, cowpeas,common beans, and peas in the foreseeable future. This demands that efforts remain focused onsteady development of agricultural research and administration policies to support the productionof pulse crops in the Republic of Korea. Sri Lanka Pulses such as mungbeans, cowpeas, soybeans and blackgram play a prominent role in thecropping systems of dry and intermediate zones in Sri Lanka owing to their wide ecologicaladaptability. More than 85 percent of pulse crops are grown under rainfed conditions (\" maha \" season) in the dry zone which receives between 1 200 mm and 1 900 mm of rainfall annuallycovering two-thirds of the country. The major constraints impacting on productivity of pulses were identified as limited use of high- yielding varieties and fertilizer, use of poor quality seed, poor adoption of recommendedagronomic practices, poor use of inputs, high incidence of pest and diseases, high risk associatedwith rainfed farming and high cost of production inputs such as labour. Being the main responsibleinstitute, the Field Crops Research and Development Institute (FCRDI) in the Department ofAgriculture has developed high-yielding improved varieties and technologies in order to improveproductivity of the pulse crops. The most important constraints limiting productivity were insects,pests and disease outbreaks in the field and storage pests. No resistant or highly tolerant varietieshave been recommended and released against very serious stored pests (bruchids) in cowpeas andviruses in mungbeans.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 16Thailand The area under pulse cultivation in Thailand has been declining because of lack of quality seed, unsuitable environment and competition with higher-income crops. Major pulses grown in thecountry are soybeans, mungbeans and peanuts. But the cropped area under pulses is decliningbecause of inadequate supply of quality seed, increasing exposure to unfavourable growingenvironment and lack of competitive edge over other alternate crops. These constraints, however,should not get in the way of realizing a whole range of unique benefits to be derived fromcultivation and consumption of pulses. They are full of essential nutrients for people and animals,in addition, they have a short production period that allows inclusion cropping systems leadingto improvement of soil properties and sustainability of intensive agriculture. Many types of food processing industries established in the country serve as the basis for expanding the market and driving the demand for pulses which will incentivize efforts forincreasing domestic supply of pulses through both horizontal and vertical expansion (enhancingproductivity). Other measures are development of national standards in seed production systems,value added product development and strengthening research and development on pulses. Finallyfarmers should be involved in the knowledge dissemination process. These processes should beapplied to enhance pulse production.III. Concept Note and Programme 1717CONCEPT NOTE Introduction Pulses have a unique nutritional profile rich in high quality protein. Being the principal source of dietary protein, they are also called the meat of the poor in many developing countries. Pulsescontain 22-24 percent protein, which is almost twice the content of protein in wheat and threetimes that in rice. In addition, pulses are an excellent source of essential amino acids, fatty acids,mineral and vitamins. They also contain several anti-nutrients believed to play a role in energyregulation. Pulses are also relatively low in energy density and a good source of digestible protein.Their carbohydrates are slowly digested, which allows some of the lowest glycemic index (GI)among carbohydrate-containing foods. In most developing countries, pulses play a fundamental role as a low-fat, high-fibre source of protein, an essential component of traditional food baskets. Pulses are a regular part of the diets of millions of people, consumed by both vegetarian and non-vegetarian segments of population in various forms. Over 60 percent of the total utilizationof pulses is for human consumption. But the importance of pulses in human diets varies fromregion to region and country to country, with a general trend of higher consumption in lowerincome nations. The share of food use in total utilization of pulses in the developing countries isover 75 percent, compared with 25 percent in the developed countries. Pulses contribute about 10 percent of the daily protein intake and 5 percent of energy intake and hence are of particular importance for food security in low income countries, where the majorsources of proteins are non-animal products. In addition, pulses also contain significant amountsof other essential nutrients like calcium, iron and lysine. Pulses are locally adapted and can begrown by farmers for their own nutrition as well as for sale, which is important to improve foodsecurity. They are highly accepted crops which keep well in storage. Pulses also play an important role in improving soil health, long-term fertility and sustainability of the cropping patterns. They meet up to 80 percent of their nitrogen requirement by biologicalnitrogen fixation from air and leave behind substantial amounts of residual nitrogen and organicmatter for subsequent crops. Inclusion of pulse crops in the cropping system improves the organic carbon content of the soil. Pulses can be grown under a wide range of soil and climatic conditions. They play important rolesin crop rotation, mixed and inter-cropping, maintaining soil fertility through nitrogen fixation,release of soil-bound phosphorous, and thus contribute significantly to sustainability of thefarming systems. Pulses, such as dry peas, lupins and beans are also used as feedstuff. Some 25 percent of the total use of pulses goes for feeding animals, namely pigs and poultry. Complementing animal feed withIII. Concept Note and Programme Regional Consultation on \"Promotion of Pulses for the Multiple Benefits in Asia\" 29-30 June 2015, Bangkok, ThailandProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 18improved varieties of pulses has been shown to significantly improve animal nutrition too, yielding better livestock, which in turn supports food security. Despite having superior nutritional quality over cereals and being well adapted under local conditions, the cropped area under pulse crops and their productivity in this region have beenslowing down lessening food and nutrition security of millions of smallholder and other farmingcommunities. In many countries these crops are still surviving in subsistence farming thanks solelyto the initiatives of poor farmers. There is a real danger that if this trend continues, production ofpulses may become extinct in future. This set the stage for FAO RAP to hold a regional consultation to help member countries share knowledge of their respective countries in these fields in order to promote these crops ina sustainable manner. Objective The proposed Regional Consultation is planned to apprise member countries on the current statusof pulse R&D and outreach programmes, input delivery systems, capacity building, socio-economicimpact, value chains including processing and marketing, climate change adaptation, and a wholerange of other factors responsible for low productivity, production and under-utilization of pulseswith the ultimate goal of improving food and nutrition security of smallholder farmers and poorconsumers by increasing pulse production, productivity and farmers incomes. Specific objectives To assess the current status of pulse sector development, identify issues responsible forlow productivity and future opportunities for its development in Asia. To exchange and share knowledge, experience, encountered problems, and availabletechnologies in order to learn from each others' experience and lessons. To identify constraints and gaps limiting the further development of pulses in Asia,including access to technology, delivery of support services, value chain includingprocessing and marketing in the context of food and nutrition security. To identify priority action, relevant policy options and recommendations for promotion ofpulses in Asia. Expected outputs Country status on pulse production, lessons learnt, opportunities and future plansdocumented and shared. Knowledge shared and experiences learnt on pulse production and utilization technologyand other associated interventions with greater attention to policy, research and outreachprogrammes, utilization, nutritional value, support services, marketing and value chain,including processing and marketing, capacity building on pulses for its multiple benefit inAsian countries.

The group discussion was organized in four sessions to facilitatemaximum participation of all countries. The major issues raised and recommendations thatemerged from the group discussion are presented here. Working Group 1: Policy, strategy and governance in pulse development 1. Mobilize adequate government support and policy advocacy in support of policy formulation, institutional arrangements and R&D of pulses with a focus on strengtheningthe role of pulses in cropping systems aimed at enhancing food and nutritional security. 2. In view of the markets for pulses being thin and fragmented, undertake a range of measures for improving market functioning and supply chain of pulses, including provisionof market intelligence and increasing support to market chain development and R&D onvalue-added products with a focus on building adequate storage, grading, milling, secondary processing facilities. 3. Taking into account the high vulnerability of pulses crops to both biotic (pests and diseases) and abiotic constraints (temperature extremes and aberrant rainfall driven byclimate change), design and implement appropriate crop insurance schemes as a hedgeagainst crop failures. 4. Improve the profitability of cultivation of pulse crops through provision of incentives to farmers, such as competitive price supports through government procurementprogrammes, low-interest credit, and provision of subsidies on pulse-specific inputs. 5.

Country status reports 2929Dr AKM Mahbubul Alam Principal Scientific Officer Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council Abstract Food legumes, including pulses, play an important role in rainfed agriculture and also are a source of protein supplement in Bangladeshi diets. Pulses grown in Bangladesh are grasspeas, lentils, mungbeans, blackgrams and chickpeas. They occupy about 93 percent of the total pulse area and contribute 97 percent to the t otal production. Cowpeas, though a minor crop, are predominantly grown in the southern part where they are preferred. Among pulses,lathyrus occupies the largest area (37 percent) followed by lentils (23 percent), blackgram (7 percent), mungbeans (24 percent), felon (7 percent) and chickpeas (1 percent). The area under pulses was 384 ,000 ha and production was 298 ,000 tonnes in 2004/05. In 2013/14, the area rose to 780 ,000 ha and production to 824 ,000 tonnes (AIS, DAE). To meet the chronic deficit of domestic production of pulses on average about 320 ,000 tonnes of pulses are imported every year during the past ten years to satisfy domestic demand.Among the imported pulses dry peas rank at the top, followed by lentils and chickpeas. A total of 56 varieties of pulses have been released and many of them are tolerant to major diseases. Cultivation packages and management options of major pests and diseases have beendeveloped. Efforts were also made to disseminate these technologies through a pilot project which produced a remarkable impact. Some niches have been identified for increasing pulse production in Bangladesh. Major constraints to pulse cultivation in the country are botrytis gray mold (BGM) a disease of chickpeas, stemphylium blight and rust of lentils, mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) in mugbeans and blackgram, and pod borer in chickpeas. Introduction Pulses play a significant role in rainfed agriculture and in average Bangladeshi diets. Among the pulses grown in the country, (Pisum sativum L.) are the major ones. They occupy 93 percent of the total area under pulses and contribute more than 97 percent to total pulse production in the country. Other pulses grown inthe and horse grams. Pulses are cultivated in three seasons a year in Bangladesh. Lentils, lathyrus, chickpeas, fieldpeas, cowp eas and faba beans are cultivated during rabi (winter) season (November-March). Blackgrams, mungbeans and horse grams are cultivated during kharif-II (rainy) season (August-December). Mungbeans are also grown during late rabi (January-April) in the southern districts and kharif-I season (March-June) in western districts. Pulses are traditionallycultivated under rainfed conditions without addition of much input. At present, mungbeans arecultivated using irrigation in kharif-I season in some areas of western districts.VI. Country status reports Recent achievements in research and development of pulses in BangladeshProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 30Trends in pulse area, production and productivity The area, production and yield of different pulse crops in Bangladesh exhibited a declining trend over the period 1985-2005. The total area under pulses dropped from 734 ,500 ha to 275 ,300 ha (37.5 percent) over the period 1985/90-2005/06 and production fell from 510 ,520 tonnes to 208,500 tonnes (41 percent) during this period. Crop-wise the area under lentils was reduced from 215,300 ha to 104 ,000 ha and production from 156 ,200 tonnes to 91 ,000 tonnes. Chickpea area sharply decreased from 103 ,200 ha to 10 ,700 ha and similar trend was evident in production also. Grass pea area dropped from 232 ,000 ha to 98 ,600 ha and production from 167 ,200 tonnes to 88,570 tonnes. Blackgram area decreased from 68 900 ha to 23 900 ha and production from 48,200 tonnes to 19 ,500 tonnes. Mungbean area and production almost reduced to half, though its area has increased in kharif 1 season but it has not been reflected in the statistics. However, theyields of these pulses have increased steadily over this period. The main reasons for declining pulses areas is crop competition in rabi season as well as yield instability of pulses due to biotic and abotic constraints. Cultivation of boro rice expanded to theareas under grass peas, chickpeas and field peas in the medium low land, while wheat, potato,maize and vegetables have taken over the lands of lentils, mungbeans and blackgrams. Pulses arenot able to complete with these crops. Both the area and production of pulses showed an increasing trend over the period 2007/08- 2013/14. It was due to development of high-yielding, disease resistant and short-duration variety.Therefore, it is urgently necessary to augment the pulse production in the country not only tomeet the demand of the increasing population but also to reduce imports to save hard earnedforeign exchange. Pulses in sustaining soil productivity Legumes have played an important role in sustaining productivity of soils through the centuries.In Bangladesh, declining soil fertility is due to intensive use of lands without proper replenishmentof plant nutrients especially where HYV cereals are being cultivated using unbalanced doses ofmineral fertilizers with little or no organic recycling (Karim and Iqbal, 2001). The main processesof fertility decline in Bangladesh are depletion of soil organic matter, degradation of physical andchemical properties of soils (Karim and Iqbal, 2001), reduction in availability of major- andmicronutrients and lowering of groundwater table (Miah et al. , 1993). Legumes can add 20-60 kg residual N to the succeeding crop (Ahlawat and Srivastava, 1994). They trap atmospheric N through root nodules and add substantial amounts of protein-rich biomass onthe soil surface. Inclusion of legumes in cropping systems helps meet in part the heavy Nrequirement of modern intensive cereal-based cropping systems as well as improving generallythe physical and chemical properities of soil (Kumar Rao et al. , 1998). Legumes in rotation with cereals economize the use of nitrogenous fertilizers to the extent of 30-40 kg/ha (Ali, 1994,Chandra, 1998, Rego et al., 1998). Ahlawat et al. (1998) reported that incorporation of mungbean stover in a rice - wheat - mungbean system improved physical properties of soil by lowering bulkdensity and enhancing hydraulic conductivity. This also improves soil microbial biomass and theiractivity which is vital for supporting long-term soil health and productivity. Growing of legumeshelps to conserve this soil N and it is recycled to rice by incorporating the legumes. So it is evident that inclusion of legumes in the system helps improve the soil's physical, chemical and biological properties which are mainly degraded in a cereal-based cropping system. Thereforelegumes, in general, play a vital role in enhancing crop productivity.VI. Country status reports 31Pulse-based farming systems In Bangladesh pulses are grown in pulse - rice cropping systems. Lentils like other pulses contribute to food and feed resources and to sustainable crop production by improving soil health and breaking disease and pest cycles. Lentils are grown in rice/jute - fallow - lentil cropping systemsin medium high lands and in jute - fallow - lentil cropping systems in medium low lands. Amongthe pulses, grass peas, lentils, chickpeas, field peas and cowpeas are mainly grown after the harvestof monsoon-rice during October-April. But in most cases, pulse cultivation (specifically lentils) afterthe monsoon-rice harvest is delayed and consequently the growing crop becomes vulnerable tohigher infestation of diseases and insects pests, matures earlier resulting in lower yields. New cropping patterns including mungbean and blackgram have been developed, such as Aus/ jute - mungbean/blackgram - Rabi crops in place of Aus/jute - fallow - Rabi crops, mustard/lentil/vegetable - mungbean - rice/cotton for kharif-I. However, relay cropping of lentils in rice fields (zero tillage) can provide an effective solution. Relay cropping has been found to have 45 percentlower production costs and is more productive than sowing by tillage after the rice harvest, as itenables better and early establishment of lentil seedlings because of adequate availability of soilmoisture. Major achievements in pulse production Research efforts on pulses during the early 1950s was limited to the collection and evaluation oflocal germplasm. It was intensified in 1961-1962 with the establishment of Pulses and OilseedDivision under the Directorate of Agriculture, Govt. of East Pakistan (Shaik and Rahman, 2001).A fresh start and more systematic approach in collection and evaluation began at the BangladeshAgricultural Research Institute (BARI) and the Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture (BINA)during the late seventies. Besides, country-wide agronomic trials, microbiological, pathological,entomological research and on-farm trials were initiated. Simultaneously constraints wereidentified. Based upon the constraints, appropriate research programmes were developed andcontinued. Some of the important research achievements made so far are discussed below. Varietal improvement A total 56 varieties of different pulses, including lentils, chickpeas, blackgrams, grass peas,cowpeas and mungbeans and peas have been developed (32 by BARI and 20 by BINA and4 by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University-BSMARU). Disease management Disease problems of major pulses were identified and yield loss due to some majordiseases studied. Protection of lentil and chickpea from collar rot attack was developed by treating seedswith Vitavax 200 @ 2.5 g/kg seed. Treatment with Rovral 50 WP at 0.2 percent was found effective in controlling stemphyliumblight of lentil when sprayed 3-4 times at 7-day intervals from the initiation of disease. Control measures for rust of lentils was developed by spraying Tilt 250 EC (0.1 percent) orCalixin MC (0.2 percent). The disease can also be avoided by early planting (1 st week of November). Control of powdery mildew disease of blackgram was developed by 2-3 foliar spray of Tilt(0.1 percent). For Cercospora leaf spot in mungbeans, foliar spray of Bavistin 50 WP(0.1 percent). Yellow mosaic virus of mungbeans can be controlled by controlling its vector, white fly, byspraying systemic insecticides.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 32Insect management Insect problems of major pulses were surveyed and major pests identified. Relothrin 10 EC (10 ml/l water), Tafgar 40 EC (2.22 ml/l water) and Malatar 57 EC (2 ml/l water) were effective in reducing pod borer of chickpeas. Foliar spray with Ripcord 4 ml or Azodrin 2 ml/l or Lmidachloprid 0.5 ml/l water waseffective in controlling insects pests of mungbeans (white fly, pod borer, thrips). Application of poison baits made with Monophos in the evening effectively controls cutworms of chickpeas. Malthion 57 EC (2 ml/l water) effectively controls aphids of lentils and lathyrus). Hand picking and destroying of 1st instar larvae of hairy caterpillar or by spot spray withLebaycid or Sumithion 2 ml/l water, was effective in controlling hairy caterpillar inblackgram, cowpeas and mungbeans. Storage Pulses grain stored in earthen containers sealed with cow dung, mud or gunny bags withpolythene lining remained free from external infestation. A cover layer of sand over thestored grains in earthen containers also prevents infestation. Dried tobacco leaves mixed with stored pulses offered substantial protection againststorage beetle. Before preservation seeds should be well dried (moisture <12 percent).Preservation should be done in an air tight container like gunny-bag with poly-lining,a plastic or metallic drum. Using phostoxin tablets (1 to 1.5 g) for every 100 kg seeds inan airtight container can keep the stored seed for about one year free from infestation. Constraints to pulses production and challenges Biotic constraints Diseases and insect pests, including stored grain pests are the major biotic constraints to pulseproduction in Bangladesh. Diseases: The important diseases of major pulses are:- (i) Chickpeas: Out of 13 diseases recorded so far, four diseases, viz. botrytis gray mold (BGM), root rot and collar rot are the major ones. BGM and collar rot may cause up to 90 percentand 84 percent yield loss respectively. All the diseases are widespread over the chickpeagrowing zones, except that BGM infestation is less in the Barind tract. (ii) Lentils: Out of 16 diseases recorded, stemphylium blight (causing up to 80 percent yield loss) and rust are the most serious ones. Collar rot and wilt may also cause yield loss tosome extent. Their distribution is almost uniform throughout the country. (iii) Mungbeans and blackgrams: Sixteen diseases in mungbeans and 21 in blackgrams have been recorded. Of these, yellow mosaic virus (causing 70-80 percent yield loss inmungbean) cercospora leaf spot, powdery mildew (42 percent loss in blackgrams) are themajor ones in both the crops, Recently, sclerotinia blight has also appeared as a majordisease. These diseases are evenly distributed throughout the growing zones. (iv) Lathyruss: Out of 11 diseases recorded, downy and powdery mildews are the major ones. Downy mildew may cause up to 12 percent yield loss while powdery mildew may causeup to 23 percent loss. Both diseases are evenly distributed across areas where lathyrus isgrown.VI. Country status reports 33(v) Insect pests: Among the 30 insects recorded many are common pests for several pulses. Aphids are common for lentils, lathyrus and mungbeans. Pod borer ( Helicoverpa armigera ) is a major pest on chickpeas and blackgrams, and can cause up to 90 percent pod damage in chickpeas. Diacrisia obliqua (hairy-streak blue butterfly) is blackgrams and mungbeans. Euchrysops cnejus signata and Bemisia tabaci (white fly) are the major pests of mungbeans and blackgrams. Agrotis ypsilon (cut worm) is a common and major pest of chickpeas, and it also attacks lentils and blackgrams. Thrips are also a major pest in mungbean that causes flower to drop.Infestation of these pests varies over space and time, depending on weather conditions. (vi) Storage pests: Fungal and insect pest infestations are major constraints in storage which can damage the seed and cause loss of seed viability. A total of 15 fungal species wererecorded from different pulses. Fungi like Aspergillus, Penicillum and Rhizopus spp. are more common in stored grain and increase in serverity with the increase of storage period. Pulseseeds are severely damaged by br uchids. Two species of this pest, Callosobruchus chinenisis and C. maculatus have been reported to infest all pulses, expect blackgrams, which are attacked only by C. maculatus. Abiotic constraints A range of climatic and soil factors limit the productivity of both winter and summer pulses grown in Bangladesh. Among these, drought, excess moisture, and adverse temperature and soilconditions are important. Drought: The climatic conditions in Bangladesh are variable, particularly during the post-rainy (winter) season. In some years very little rainfall occurs during the winter season and the majorlegumes (lentils, lathyrus, chickpeas) that are gr own on conserved soil moisture suffer from drought stress. Dried-out surface soil hampers proper germination and emergence, especially in case of latesown lentils and chickpeas. Consequently, optimum plant stand cannot be established and, asa result, yield is low. The crops can suffer from drought stress during vegetative as well asreproductive phases. This leads to abortion of flowers and young pods and prevents seed filling. Excess soil moisture and humidity: In some years excessive rainfall can occur during the winter season and this can cause substantial yield loss. If it occurs at an early stage, it encouragesexcessive vegetative growth leading to lodging, and also encourages development of various leafand root diseases. If rainfall occurs at the reproductive stage, it not only physically damages theflowers and developing pods/seeds, but also encourages foliar diseases, such as botrytis gray mold(BGM) in chickpeas, rust and stemphylium blight in lentils, downy mildew in lathyrus. Some of thesediseases can also complete yield loss in these crops. High rainfall coupled with high humidity alsoencourages insect infestation. In some years when rainfall occurs at the time of crop maturity(April), it affects crop yields owing to pod-shedding, seed rotting and hampering of harvesting andthreshing. Temperature extremes: Low temperatures encountered during January-February especially towards the northern region of the country can affect vegetative growth and pod set of both cooland warm season legumes. A sudden rise in temperature in late February in some years severelyreduces vegetative growth and pod formation of Rabi pulses, especially of late sown lentils andchickpeas. Soil factors: Pulse crops have been traditionally grown in the Ganges floodplain soil, although chickpea cultivation is now increasing in the Barind tract. The soils of the Barind tract are mainlyimperfectly to poorly drained, brown to grey, loamy to clayey soils. The surface soil is acidic. In soilsof higher clay content, plough pan formation impedes root development of crops following rice.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 34Challenges Resurgence of new diseases and insects. Lack of related wild species as a resistance source of pest and disease. Drought or excess moisture. Salinity. High competition with Boro rice and Rabi crops. Sensitivity to microclimate. Delayed sowing; and Less productivity compared to other crops. Current efforts for improving pulse productivity In the National Agricultural Research System, BARI and BINA are engaged in research on grain legume drawing on a range of collaboration with international research centres like theInternational Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), International Center forAgricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) and the World Vegetable Center. The mainactivities are to identify the constraints to pulses and initiate research accordingly; introduce andevaluate germplasm from exotic and local sources; establish linkage with international centers andundertake human capacity building through higher studies and training. The current efforts areas follows: Strengthening research for development of suitable high-yield technology package. Seed production of improved varieties through the Bangladesh Agricultural DevelopmentCorporation (BADC). Strengthening extension services through training and demonstration programmes tofamiliarize farmers with the latest production technology. In the past, the government launched a special project on pulses called \"Pilot Production Project on lentil, mungbean and blackgram\" in 1996/97 which continued till 2002. The main objectives ofthis project were to extend improved varieties and production technologies of these crops amongthe farmers to increase their area and production. This project created an excellent impact onexpanding new varieties and increasing yield of the targeted crops. The ministry of agriculture alsocompleted another project on strengthening of pulses and oilseed research from 2005 to 2010 forthe development of improved technologies. A project titled \"Introduction of short duration pulses into rice based cropping systems in western Bangladesh\" , supported by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR),started operations beginning January 2011 and is sla ted for completion in December 2015. The main objectives of this project are to identify short-duration lentil, field pea and mungbeanvarieties and appropriate technologies and to introduce them in the rice-based cropping systemsin ten western districts of Bangladesh. BARI is the lead agency for conducting on-station andon-farm research and will provide technical support for up scaling of the technologies by DAE andNGOs. IRRI Bangladesh office is coordinating the project activities. Pulses for conservation agriculture Conservation agriculture (CA) systems are yet to be developed for cultivation of pulse crops in theintensive rice-based cropping systems (three rice crops in a year in addition to other cereals,legumes and/or oilseed crops) of Bangladesh. Normally lathyrus is cultivated by broadcast lathyrusseeds before B aman and also T aman rice harvest in medium low lands, clay loam and clay soil.In southern regions, cowpeas also are cultivated by broadcasting seed before the rice harvest. AfterVI. Country status reports 35the harvest of monsoon rice, it is often difficult to take advantage of the optimum sowing time for pulse crops to be grown as a sole crop because of the delay in harvesting rice and excessivesoil moisture. It was also identified that as a result of climatic change, frequently high temperatures prevail during the end of crop cycles. In these circumstances, relay cropping, a conservation technology,can be practiced that allows broadcasting seeds of pulses in the standing crop of monsoon rice15-20 days before rice harvesting begins. Research conducted on-station as well as on farmers'fields showed that relay cropping of different Rabi pulses produces up to 64 percent higher yieldthan does the conventional tillage system because of timely sowing and the best use of residualsoil moisture and also low cost technology. Besides these, inclusion of pulses in cereal-based cropping patterns makes an important contribution to increasing food and feed production without damaging the environment. It alsosupports crop diversification and sustainable agricultural production by adding nitrogen to the soiland breaking cereal-based monoculture. Pulses contribution to nutrition, employment and income generation, value chain development including processing and marketing Pulses are not only a rich source of protein but also a good source of carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. The presence of different types of proteins and other smaller molecules, includingalkaloids, isoflavins, polyphenols and a variety of oligosccharids make legumes seed unique inproviding nutracuticals. Pulse protein is now looked upon as phospholipid and cholestorellowering agents. They also contain significant amount of fibre that prevent constipation (Palande,2010). Besides these, grain legumes are characterized by a relatively low glycemic index that is onehalf of white bread. Hence it is beneficial to incorporate legumes in the diet of people havingdiabetes (type 2) (Mehta et al. , 2005). Although pulses have, in general, high nutritive values but they also contain some antinutritional factors, such as high beta-oxalyl-amino-alanine (Liner, 1980). However, fortunatelymost of these antinutritional factors are heat liable and are destroyed on cooking or roasting(Williams et al. , 1994). Considering both positive and negative sides the nutritionists consider pulses as highly nutritious food and a substitute for animal protein. Short-duration legume varieties play an important role in employment and income generation in rural communities. Especially in case of mungbean cultivation, women workers can take part inharvesting mungbeans. Integrated Farm Management Component (IFMC) works on empowermentof women, where women can focus on business activities and hold the cash after selling. Pulsesare more susceptible than other crops to stored grain pests. As a result, farmers can't store theirproduce for long and hence they sell it immediately after harvest at low price. There is neithera definite marketing channel nor a government support price for pulses. Also high labour wagesdiscourage the farmers from taking care of pulses. The Integrated Farm Management Component is implemented by the Department of Agricultural Extension for marketing and value chain development. IFMC provides support to farmers sellingin bulk and collectively by organizing farmers' group. Similar projects were also supported by theDanish International Development Agency (DANIDA). IFMC is building capacity among farmers(landless, marginal and small scale households) and organizing them to sell their produce totraders at higher levels of the value chain. IFMC is also building the capacity of DAE field staff toemphasize farming as a business and advise farmers' organizations on business planning,Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 36marketing and market linkage. In the National Agricultural Technology Project (NATP Phase 1), the Hortex Foundation developed Commodity Collection and Marketing Centre (CCMC) based onmarket linkage and improved smallholder farmers' access to market information through adoptionof appropriate technologies and strengthening farmer-market linkages. Strategy for meeting future challenges and opportunities The production of pulses in the country has not increased commensurate with the populationgrowth. The population of Bangladesh will cross 173 million by 2020 and 195.3 million by 2030(estimated). As mentioned earlier, the current domestic demand for pulses is met by both localproduction (46 percent) and commercial imports (54 percent). If, however, the current rate ofconsumption of pulses remains unchanged, the requirement is estimated to be 13.1 percent higherin 2020 and 27.7 percent higher in 2030. This means the reliance on imports is set to increase inthe absence of measures to stimulate further growth in productivity and production of pulses.Therefore, concerted efforts need to be directed at augmenting the production of pulses. Opportunities for increasing pulses production Pulses face tough competition with rice, maize and other high value crops. The present croppingintensity is 190 percent and the scope of expansion for pulses as a sole crop is very limited.Therefore, the strategy to expand pulse cultivation should be built on (1) increasing productivityby adopting improved varieties and cultural practices (vertical expansion) and (2) increasing thecultivation area by introducting new cropping pa tterns and utilization of fallow lands (horizontal expansion). Vertical expansion Fifty-six varieties have been released by BARI, BINA and BSMRAU, most of which are high yieldingand tolerant to major stress factors. The recently released varieties of lentils are resistant to rustand tolerant to stemphylium blight, chickpea varieties are resistant to wilt, mungbean andblackgram varieties are tolerant to YMV and cercospora leaf spot, etc. At research stations the yieldsof these varieties are very high but in farmer's fields the yields are not that high. For example, seedyield of lentil varieties ranged from 2 ,000 to 2 ,200 kg/ha at research stations depending on variety. The results of on-farm trials conducted by OFRD showed an average yield of 1 ,350 kg/ha, whereas the national average yield of lentils is only 738 kg/ha which is about one third of the potentialyield. This means the national yield gap of lentils is 45 percent compared with farmers' fielddemonstration yields. Similarly the yield gap of lathyrus is 44 percent, chickpeas 51 percent.Therefore, these varieties along with their production technologies should be extended to farmersto replace the low-yielding local cultivars. This will ultimately enhance productivity. Horizontal expansion Some potential niches for fitting pulses in to rice-based cropping systems are as follows: i) Expansion of mungbeans in Kharif-I season: Mungbeans have been successfully introduced in the lentil/mustard/wheat - mungbean - T. aman rice cropping systems in andnorthern districts like Jessore, Kustia, Pabna, Natore and Rajshahi. Still there is much scopeto expand the coverage of these patterns to more areas in these districts. In northerndistricts like Rangpur, Dinajpur, Thakurgaon, Panchagarh, a large area can be brought underthese patterns provided lime @ 2 t/ha and Born @ 1.5 kg/ha are applied in addition toother recommended doses of fertilizers.VI. Country status reports 37ii) Expansion of blackgrams in Kharif-II season in Aus/jute - blackgram - rabi cropping patterns. One of the patterns in the highlands in western districts is Aus rice/jute-fallow-Rabi crops. This fallow period is about 80-90 days. In this fallow period short-durationblackgram varieties can be cultivated without disturbing the existing cropping pattern. iii) Expansion of chickpeas in Barind, Sylhet and northern part of Barisal district. A large area remains fallow after harvest of T. aman rice in the Barind tract of Rajshahi district, Sylhetand northern part of Barisal district. Chickpeas can be sown in mid November after harvestof early aman rice before depletion of soil moisture in Barind tract and Sylhet. It can beplanted in late November-mid December in the northern Upazilas of Barisal districts. iv) Cowpeas and mungbeans should be extended in the southern districts. These crops are sporadically grown in the greater Chittagong, N oakhali, Bhola and Barisal districts. There is great scope to bring more lands under these crops with improved varieties andproduction practices. However, extension of pulses is not an easy task. It must be an integrated approach like the one followed in the pilot project where seed supply was ensured by BADC, DAE organized farmers'training where demonstrations and research institutes provided technical support and training.Project activities were regularly monitored by project partners in the field. Lentils and mungbeans intercrop with sugarcane: Lentils and mungbeasn are sporadically grown as intercrop with sugarcane in the high lands. There is about 40 000 ha land suitable for suchintercrop in the sugarcane growing zones. If part of this area can be brought under theseintercropping systems, a substantial amount of pulses can be added to the total production. Future research on pulses should be target-oriented and top priority should be given to developing stress tolerant HYVs for traditional and potential areas with regional preferenceaddressing the specific problems. Crop-wise varietal needs are as follows: i) Lentils: Rust and stemphylium resistant high-yielding varieties, short-duration with wider adaptation (for traditional and non-traditional areas). ii) Chickpeas: Botrytis Gray Mold (BGM)-resistant and tolerant to excess moisture with high yield potential. iii) Lathyrus: High-yielding variety with wider adaptation. iv) variety. v) Cowpeas: YMV-resistant, salinity tolerant, high-yielding variety for the southern belt. Disease and pest management research should be strengthened. New pathotypes and virulence of pests are emerging. These should be continuously monitored and management practices shouldbe developed in addition to identification of resistant sources. New cropping patterns need to bedeveloped involving pulses, especially rice-based (with short-duration aman rice varieties), low costweed management techniques. Identification of potential areas and limiting factors for pulses andfinding their solutions are also necessary. Breeder's seed production needs to be intensified so that BADC and private seed companies can multiply the seed of new varieties to meet the demand. Finally, a special project like the pilotproject may be taken up for research and development of technology for promotion of pulses inthe country.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 38Reaching out to farmers and consumers About 75 percent people in Bangladesh are involved in agriculture. The government of Bangladesh gives priority to ensuring fair prices for farmer's products. Connecting farmers to consumers vialocal, urban, regional and global markets can raise incomes, deliver food from surplus to deficitregions and stabilize food prices. The IFMC, being implemented by DAE, is focusing on marketingand value chain development and improving infrastructure and support services so as to unblock'value chains' and increase market access. Smallholders can improve their livelihoods by reachingconsumers beyond their local markets. IFMC supports smallholders in their efforts to organize andbuild capacity so that they can sell in different markets, and contribute to domestic health andnutrition. Besides these initiatives, DAE also provides support to farmers through small farmergroups, farmers marketing associations, co-operative marketing and contract farming andmarketing. Some private companies contract directly with farmers to produce pulses to sell asa value added product. Conclusion Pulses are an important food legume that also improves soil fertility and contributes to thenutritional security of farmers. Pulse production in Bangladesh needs to increase 27 pecent by2030 to keep pace with the growth of the population. Development of disease resistant andhigh-yielding varieties and the expansion of their cultivation can play a vital role in increasingproduction. Rabi pulses should be introduced as intercrop/mix crop/relay crop in the cropping system. Research should focus on developing disease resistant, short-duration and high-yieldingvarieties which are suitable for existing cropping patterns. For popularizing improved pulsevarieties, production technology and technical support should be extended to farmers.VI. Country status reports 3939Tashi Wangdi1 and Cheku Dorji2 1 Chief District Agriculture Officer, District Administration, Punakha 2 Research Officer, Field Crops, Research & Development Centre, Bajo Abstract Bhutan is a small landlocked country with an area of 38 394 km2 and a population of 745 ,153 people. Agriculture is the economic backbone of the country. Traditionally, Bhutan hasrecognized nine food crops known as \"dra-na-gu\" for its food security. These are rice, maize,wheat, barley, buckwheat, millet, amaranth, mustard and pulses. Pulses or grain legumes haveplayed a diverse role in the Bhutanese farming system and still continue to do so. However,compared with other major cereals, pulses have received less focus and attention from thegovernment and the pulse producers. Consequently, not much progress has been made inresearch and development of pulses in the country. In order to achieve the country's food andnutritional security, it will be critical to: 1) create a national legume sub-programme,2) strengthen research and development on pulses, 3) introduce legume promotionalprogrammes as in other cereals, 4) develop human resources, 5) have systematic seedproduction programmes and 6) organize marketing support for pulses. Without these, it wouldbe difficult to scale up pulse production in the country. Introduction Physical setting The Kingdom of Bhutan is a small landlocked mountainous country located on the southern slopesof the Eastern Himalayas and surrounded by two giant countries - China in the north and Indiain the south. It has a total geographical area of 38 ,394 km2 and a population of 745 ,153 people (NSB, 2014). The land rises from an elevation of about 200 meters above sea level in the southadjoining the Indian plains to over 7 ,550 meters in the north. Because of this, there are extreme variations in climate, agro-ecology, and biodiversity. According to the Bhutan Land Cover Assessment 2010, only 2.93 percent of the country's total geographical area is cultivated agriculture land, of which 61.9 percent (69 ,670.79 ha) is dry land, 27.9 percent (31 ,361.23 ha) is wetland (irrigated paddy field) and 10.2 percent (11 ,524.19 ha) is horticultural land. The average cultivated agriculture landholding is about 3 acres (RNR statistics,2012).Recent achievement in research and development of pulses in BhutanProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 40Agriculture in Bhutan Agriculture is the economic backbone of the country. It contributes about 16 percent of GDP (NSB, 2014) and directly engages 56 percent of the total population for their livelihood (NLFS, 2013). Themajority of Bhutanese farmers practice subsistence farming, but are slowly moving towardscommercial or market-oriented production systems. The main cereal crops grown are rice, maize, wheat, barley, buckwheat and millets, but rice is by far the most important and preferred food crop.Farming in Bhutan is a challenge because of small land holding size and rugged topography withsteep slopes on most agricultural land, making farm labour intensive and mechanization difficult.Owing to a wide range of agro-ecological zones, diverse agriculture production systems exist(see Table 1).

Source: MoA, 2002 Pulses and grain legumes in Bhutan Traditionally, Bhutan has recognized nine food crops known as \" dra-na-gu \" for its food security. These are rice, maize, wheat, barley, buckwheat, millet, amaranth, mustard and pulses. Pulses orgrain legumes have been and will continue to play diverse role in the Bhutanese farming systems,e.g. as food crops through direct consumption as grain, green pod and leaves thereby contributingtowards food security and dietary diversity goals, as a cash crop through sale which helps reducepoverty and as fodder crop thereby contributing to livestock productivity and as a rotation crop.They are grown in diverse land use systems, but more than 75 percent of the national legumes orpulses are grown in dry lands (National Legumes Survey, 1999). While a survey in 1999 hasVI. Country status reports 41recorded 16 species, the most widely grown pulse species in Bhutan are Gycine max ). Trends in pulse area, production and productivity Generally, compared to major cereals (rice and maize), the contribution of the minor cereals to the food basket has declined due to increased consumption of rice and non-cereal items owing toenhanced purchasing power of consumers. In 2013, the total production of all pulses was 1 ,665 tonnes compared with rice 75 ,228 tonnes, maize 75 ,715 tonnes and wheat 4 ,286 tonnes (DoA, 2013). This huge production gap may be attributed to the area under cultivation (see Figure 1) andthe yield, both of which are comparatively low for pulses. However, the average yield of about0.8 tonne/ha is comparable with that of some Asian countries, e.g. 0.69 tonne/ha in India,0.86 tonne/ha in Nepal and 0.88 tonne/ha in Bangladesh, but lags much behind that of2.03 tonnes/ha obtained in China (Akibode and Maredia, 2011). The factors causing lowproductivity of pulses in Bhutan are: low or negligible use of external inputs (chemical fertilizersor farm yard manure), lack of suitable high-yielding varieties, poor soil nutrient and watermanagement, inadequate plant protection measures, poor agronomic and husbandrymanagement, cultivation in marginal areas with better land allocated to other cereals, lack of focusand priority from the government and limited research on pulses. Table 2 shows the major pulseproducing Dzongkhags (Districts) in Bhutan. Pulses are largely produced in the east and the south which clearly correlates with maximum dry lands prevalent in these regions. Table 2.

Rice-based farming system isexclusively practiced in the irrigated terraced wetlands while the maize and potato-based systemsare primarily practiced in the dry lands which are largely located on steep slopes. Pulses or grainlegumes are either intercropped with maize or mono cropped as a succeeding crop following croprotation. The main legumes are rajma beans maize, in rice-based systems, legume crops, largely urd beans, are planted along the terrace bunds following the paddy transplantation.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 42Major achievements in increasing pulse production and productivity Pulses or grain legumes in Bhutan have not received adequate policy focus and attention from the government like other major cereal crops (rice, maize and wheat). Consequently, no majorinvestment has been made in research and development of pulses in the country. For instance, theNational Research Centres have developed and released about 40 varieties of fruits, 24 varietiesof vegetables, 29 varieties of cereals, but only four varieties of legumes (Dorji et al. , 2009). The development and release of these legume varieties have been possible due to institutionallinkages developed between the Department of Agriculture, the Royal Government of Bhutan andAVRDC - the World Vegetable Centre. Table 3. Agronomic traits of four legume varieties Variety Important characteristics Limithang Mung 1 Plant height 40-45 cm; Yield 1.25-2.5 t/ha. A short and early (KPS 2) maturing variety, recommended for altitudes <2 000 masl in rice and maize based cropping systems Limithang Mung 2 (Barimung 2) Plant height 35-40 cm; Yield 1.25-2.6 t/ha A short and early maturing variety, recommended for <2 000 masl in rice and maize based cropping system Khangma Libi 1 Matures in about 140 days; Yield 400-600 kg per acre (AGS 258) (monocrop) and 200-250 kg per acre (intercrop); suitable for recommended for 600-2 000 masl Constraints in productivity enhancement and emerging challenges Various biotic, abiotic and socio-economic constraints impede pulse production in Bhutan. Because of the lack of policy support, available resources and expertise in the field of pulses,considerable challenges lie ahead in addressing these constraints. The major biotic constraints onpulse production are various diseases, insects and weeds. Among diseases, foliar disease is the mostcommonly observed one in pulses (Tshewang, n.d). Systematic research is needed on foliar disease and other diseases and their impacts on yield. The crop damage from insects has been reportedto be minimal (Tshewang, n.d.), but for diseases, proper research is required to document their occurrences and impacts. Weeds, on the other hand, have been another obnoxious biotic constraintin pulses production. Because the majority of pulses are cultivated on rainfed dry lands, weeds suchas weed (Ageratum conyziodes L.) are commonly encountered (Tshewang, n.d.). Most of the pulses in Bhutan, as is in other countries like India, are grown in marginal areas with low fertility and unpredictable environmental conditions (Gowda et al. , 2013). Farmers apply limited efforts on soil fertility and water management and, as a result, pulse crops are exposed to bothnutrient and water stress which drastically reduces cr op production and productivity. The situation becomes more aggravated as the pulses are largely grown in drylands. Pulses are considered as secondary crops both by the government and the farmers alike. Government has provided the main policy support to rice in achieving the country's foodself-sufficiency, although pulses too have potential to contribute towards food and nutritionsecurity. Similarly, farmers also give first priority to staple cereals because of the support providedby the government, including easy access to inputs and market. Furthermore, there are noVI. Country status reports 43high-yielding varieties and packages of best practices for pulses readily available to farmers and even marketing is limited to FCB auction yards only. Therefore, to encourage farmers to enhancepulse production, it is critical to address the above socio-economic constraints. Pulse production in Bhutan is challenged by other factors, such as limited landholding coupled with loss to infrastructure development and natural disasters through land degradation, high production cost due to farm labour shortages and the limited scope for farm mechanization owingto mountain topography, human wildlife conflict and climate change. Current efforts for improving pulse productivity As noted in earlier sections, pulses have received very little policy support and investment fromthe government in terms of its Research and Development (R&D). Therefore, there has been verylittle incentive to enhance pulse production and productivity. Noting this, efforts have been madeto revive pulse research particularly with the institution of three-year SAARC project on shuttlebreeding since July 2009. The main collaborating coun tries are India, Bhutan and Nepal. The project is coordinated by the Indian Institute of Pulses Research in Kanpur under the aegis of IndianCouncil of Agricultural Research. Bhutan has benefitted immensely in accessing the germplasm of different species from the collaborators and human capacity development through workshops and training courses. Severalelite lines or varieties of mungbeans (11), urd beans (8), rajma beans (5), and lentils (3) have beenreceived from the collaborators which are currently undergoing vigorous testing at differentResearch and Development Centres (RDCs). Table 3 shows the agronomic traits of different varietiesof pulses received as part of SAARC shuttle breeding. Parallel to on-station testing, evaluation infarmers' fields will be carried out for those varieties that have shown promising results. If there isconvincing performance in the farmers' fields, the varieties will be released by the releasingcommittee in the ministry for general use. Table 4.

Clearly, the goal takesinto account climate change as the Renewable Natural Resources (RNR) sector is going to beimpacted the most by climate change and climate-induced disasters. In line with this, the RNRSector Adaptation Plan of Action (RNR-SAPA) has been prepared highlighting the maininterventions to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. One of the actionsprioritized in the RNR-SAPA is the promotion of climate smart agriculture (CSA) and conservationagriculture (CA). Both CSA and CA share intercropping with legumes and crop rotation as thecommon crop management practices. Intercropping with pulses or legumes help to protect soilfrom extreme erosion, improves soil structure, enhances the soil fertility status (Powers, L.E. andMcSorley, R., 1999). Similarly, through crop rotation with legumes and other crops, farmers canavoid or reduce the problem of soil-borne diseases and weeds. They can also manage wateravailability by sequencing crops that have different patterns and amount of water use (Loomis amdConor, 1996). There are other new frontiers and initiatives to enhance sustainable agriculture such as organic agriculture and sustainable land management, which has compatible or complementary principleswith CSA and CA. In Bhutan, the majority of the far mers practice integrated farming systems and continue to use indigenous and traditional technologies, mainly using legumes in intercroppingand crop rotation. This makes small Bhutanese farms more diverse and sustainable as it focuseson effective and efficient use of available resources. It avoids dependence on a single crop. A morediverse farm helps farmers meet their subsistence, social and cultural needs besides the in-situ conservation of agro-biodiversity resources (Katwal, 2010). A wide diversity of genetic resourcesat the farm level also ensures sustainability of a farm system (Reijntjes et al , 1996). Therefore, pulses have a very important place and role in the CSA, CA and other allied agricultural systems.Table 4.

Country status reports 45Socio-economics of pulse production Pulse as a cash crop The major grain crops, rice, maize, wheat, barley and buckwheat, are largely produced for home consumption with only about 1 percent of the production going into the market (Table 4). Themost important agriculture products with a large proportion flowing into the market, especiallyin India and Bangladesh are mandarin, apple and potato (Figure 2). About 33 percent of the totalpulse production is going into the market, earning more than Nu 26 million. In general, the countryhas a negative balance of trade on cereals, edible oils and horticultural commodities. For instance,in 2014, the country has imported about 2 ,779 tonnes of pulses worth Nu 149 million, while the export was 142 tonnes worth Nu 8 million (BTS, 2014). All these commodities are imported fromIndia thereby contributing substantially to the shortage of Indian Rupees in the country. Therefore,there is a huge opportunity and potential to enhance agriculture production in the countryincluding pulses or grain legumes. Table 5.

As such, the focus of agriculture development in the past decades hasbeen on major cereal and horticulture crops with very limited attention being given to minorcereals and pulses. Even in the current 11 th FYP (2013-2018), there is no separate programme for the improvement of pulses in the country. Despite the fact that pulses or grain legumes are placedon a par with other major cereals under the overall National Field Crop Development Programme(Box 1), the focus still continues to be placed on rice, maize and wheat.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 46BOX 1 MoAF/01: National Field Crop Commodity Development Programme Field crops include rice, maize, wheat, barley, millet, buckwheat, grain legumes and oil seeds which are the major food commodities and contribute significantly to food and nutrition security both at the household and national levels. Under the National Field Crop CommodityDevelopment Programme, the following commodities will be taken up: a. Rice development b. Maize development c. Other cereals development d. Oil seeds and legumes Therefore, to enable the ministry to achieve its targeted pulse production of 5 000 tonnes by the end of 11th FYP in 2018 and also to achieve its broader objective of food and nutritional security,there is a need to: 1) create a national legume sub-programme, 2) strengthen research anddevelopment, 3) introduce legume promotional programmes as in other cereals, 4) develop humanresources, 5) build systematic seed production programmes and 6) organize marketing support forpulses. Reaching out to farmers and consumers Presently, there are three Regional Research and Development Centers (RDCs) in the country whichare strategically located at Bajo, Wengkhar and Bhur . The RDC at Bajo located in the west central region leads and coordinates the National Field Crops programme; the RDC at Wengkhar, basedin the east coordinates the national horticulture research programme while the RDC at Bhur hasthe responsibility to coordinate research and development programmes on sub-tropical crops.However, the research on pulses is being taken up by RDCs at Bajo and Bhur in collaboration withother regional and international organizations. More support is required to undertake research onvarieties that are tolerant to biotic and abiotic stresses. To assist these three RDCs in delivering improved technologies to the end users, a well-functioning extension system exists in all the twenty districts. But the extension-research linkage is currentlyweak and needs further strengthening for meaningful research engagement and services delivery.Farmers need improved and suitable varieties which are of short duration, high yielding andresistant to multiple pests and diseases. Such varieties can be promoted in a rice-based farmingsystem, where most of the paddy fields are currently left fallow due to lack of suitable pulsevarieties and other support measures. Conclusion Bhutan is an agrarian country with about 56 percent of the population engaged in agriculture fortheir livelihood. The mountainous topography limits the yield potential for most crops andincreases the labour requirements as compared to other more favourable productionenvironments, e.g. India. As a result, the production cost per unit produced is high, makingBhutanese products less competitive in regional and global markets. In fact, it is very difficult tocompete even in the domestic market with cheap Indian imports, which further discourage farmersfrom producing more. Currently, most of the cereal requirements of the country, including pulsesare met through imports which have resulted in a negative balance of trade and shortfall of IndianRupees. As far as pulse production is concerned , there exists huge opportunity and potential. But this will require support and interventions from policy, research, extension and marketing. Withoutthese collective measures, it will be difficult to scale up pulse production in the country andconsequently achieve national food and nutritional security.VI.

Country status reports 4949Lor Bunna1 and Keo Sovann2 1 Head of Agronomy and Farming System Division, CARDI 2 Vice chief of Seed Management Office, DHSC, GDA Abstract The agriculture sector remains crucial for economic stability and growth in Cambodia. Rice is the main crop and staple food that also meets the basic needs of the majority of people andmarginal farmers. Rice production relies heavily on the rainfed lowland ecosystem, whichaccounts for 86 percent of about 2 ,827,130 ha of rice production areas. The country has been self-sufficient in rice with a small amount of exportable surplus since 1995. Total riceproduction increased dramatically from 5.99 million tonnes (mt) in 2005 to 9.23 mt in 2014with 3.02 mt surplus of milled rice equivalent to 4.71 mt of paddy rice. Cultivation of other crops such as soybeans, mungbeans, peanuts, vegetables and rubber declined markedly since 1967, either because of loss of markets or because during the longperiod of civil war, most farmers reverted to subsistence rice production. Opportunities for cropdiversification and increasing household income of rice-dependent farmers exist throughgrowing legumes and vegetables in the early wet season and dry season, especially wheresupplementary irrigation can make up for deficits in stored soil moisture and rainfall.Upper and high fields with marginal water supply for rice can also be considered for cropdiversification. Legumes such mungbeans, soybeans and peanuts are suitable for growing on lowland paddy field after wet season rice or early wet season. The results of recent research conducted by theCambodian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) indicated thatmungbeans and peanuts were the high-yielding potential crops suitable for growing on thesandy soil in the rainfed lowland areas after harvesting wet season rice. Four mungbeanvarieties have been released by CARDI since 2009 which are grown after harvesting wet seasonrice. These are CMB1, CMB2, CMB3 are short-duration varieties requiring 50-55 days from planting to the first harvest with an average yield of 850 kg/ha. Theyield can be as high as 1 900 kg/ha under proper crop management and the farmer can keepthe seed for growing in next season. Based on information obtaineds from interviewing 350 households, most farmers indicated interest in growing mungbeans after wet season rice using a new integrated technologypackage. Mungbean growing in sandy soil in the rainfed lowland areas following wet seasonrice can help farmers produce sufficient food for their household and increase cash incomethroughout the year, and it improves soil fertility through crop rotation (legume) andmulticropping in paddy fields. Income from mungbeans grown in this system was shown tobe 60 percent higher than the income from growing only a single rice crop (40 percent).The integrated technology on legume growing after rice in the rainfed lowland of CambodiaProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 50Introduction The Kingdom of Cambodia, located at the centre of the Indochina peninsula, has a land area of about 181 ,035 km2 and a population of 15 million (MAFF , 2014). More than half of its land is flat, and the Mekong river flows from North to South in the heart of the country. Agriculture is themainstay of the Cambodian economy. The country is blessed with vast fertile land and the richwater resources of the Mekong river system. The agriculture sector employs around 84 percent of the total population with a high proportion of them being very poor (PDAFF, 2014). A significantnumber of the rural population lives below the poverty line, according to a government report thatshows the proportion of poor people in rural areas of Cambodia decreased from 47 percent in1994 to 35 percent in 2004 and 26 percent in 2010. Recently, the Royal Government of Camb odia announced its policy of poverty alleviation and improving the living standards of all Cambodians, especially of rural farmers by improvingagricultural production through crop diversification and the introduction of integrated farmingsystems. Agricultural production in Cambodia can be improved by diversification from traditionalwet season lowland rice production to double cropped and rice-based production systems.However, this will require significant capacity building in essential agricultural informationtechnology and extension support services to strengthen the knowledge and skills of farmers,conducting applied research and transfer of agricultural technologies through training, informationsharing and creating public awareness. In Cambodia, lowland areas are widespread throughout the country. They are suitable for rice production and are generally underutilized. Rice is the staple food crop which meets the basicneeds for the majority of people and marginal farmers. Other crops grown are legumes, maize, cashcrops, cassava and vegetables. Rice production relies heavily on the rainfed lowland ecosystemwhich accounts for 86 percent of approximately 2 ,827,130 ha of rice production areas (MAFF , 2014). It is recognized that rice productivity in a rainfed lowland system is dramatically affected by theamount of rainfall (Ouk et al. , 2001). Cambodia achieved self-sufficiency in rice with a small amount of exportable surplus in 1995 (MAFF , 1995-2015). Rice in Cambodia holds the potential to reducefood shortages among the rural poor. However, the area cultivated by other crops such as soybeans, mungbeans, peanuts, vegetables and rubber declined remarkably since 1967, either because of loss of markets or because duringthe long period of civil war, most farmers reverted to subsistence rice production (Table 1).Opportunities for crop diversification and increased household income of rice-based farmers existthrough growing legumes and vegetables in the early wet season and dry season especially wheresupplementary irrigation can make up for deficits in stored soil moisture and rainfall. Upper andhigh fields with marginal water supply for rice can also be considered for crop diversification. Basedon Landsat imagery of 1993, 1.25 million ha (mha) of land is potentially available for crops otherthan rice, and another 2.3 mha of shrub lands may also have potential (FAO, 1996). When comparedwith 0.30 mha currently under cultivation of legume and vegetable crops, this assessment indicatesa 10 to 30-fold increase of potential area for growing legumes and other horticulture crops.Security considerations have until recently hindered productive utilization of these areas. Now withthe easing of those concerns, growing population pressure and market access factors are likely tobe key drivers of the expansion of legume production as they were in northern and northeastThailand in 1960s and 1970s (Chiang Mai Uni., 1993). In July 2010, the Royal Government of Cambodia approved a policy paper on \"the Promotion of Paddy Production and Rice Export\" . This paper aims to promote agriculture development at a new pace and in a new scale that broadens and strengthens the foundation of economic growth, whileaccelerating poverty reduction and improving people's livelihoods. The purpose of this documentVI. Country status reports 51is to increase paddy production and rice exports. The Royal Government expects that the success of the \" Policy Paper on the Promotion of Paddy Production and Rice Export \" will give a strong political message that encourages and paves the way for the promotion of other agriculturalproducts such as soybeans, mungbeans, rubber, cashew nuts, cassava, maize, peanuts andvegetables, not to mention other agricultural sub-sectors such as aquaculture. All of this isembedded in the long-term, vision of the Royal Government for economic development. Legumes such mungbeans, soybeans and peanuts are suitable crops for growing on lowland paddy field after wet season rice or early wet season. The results of recent research done by CARDIindicate that mungbeans and peanuts are high-yielding potential crops suitable for growing onsandy soil in the rainfed lowland areas after harvesting wet season rice. Moreover, they havea unique nutritional profile rich in high quality protein; the principal source of dietary protein. Theyare also called the meat of the poor in many developing countries. Climate condition Cambodia is in the humid tropics and experiences annual alternating high and low pressuresystems which move seasonally over the central Asian land mass. The climate is characterized bya cool dry season from November to January, a hot dry season from February to April and wetseason from May to November. The annual mean temperature is 28\u00baC and the mean annualprecipitation is 1.44 meters, with considerable variation from year to year. In general, the climateand topography are conducive to cultivation of both tropical and temperate crops, depending onthe location within the country. However, the dry season is long and pronounced spanning fromNovember to May with little or no rainfall. The dry period is characterized by a high vapor-transpiration. Crops grown during the dryer months (January-May) usually require supplementaryirrigation. In March and April the climate is very hot and dry throughout the whole country. Scarcity of water limits crop production and relatively few crops are grown in this period. Short-duration crops are usually grown depending on the availability of water. The major crops that are grown insubsistence gardens in this period include water convolvulus, cucumber, and yard long bean.Surplus produce is sold through the local markets.Table 1.

The characteristics of these areas are the same as those of the bank tops. However, water managementduring the dry season is critical in this area. The practice of cultivating a home garden is not aswidespread in Cambodia as it is in other countries in the region (PRASAC, 1997). The brownhydromorphic soils in Battambang province are also very important areas for non-rice cropproduction (Vang et al. , 2003). Other lowland crops are also being cultivated in the upland rice fields in the northeast province of Cambodia. In Kratie, intercropping rice with rows of corn,cucumber and peanuts is common among Cambodian farmers (Javier, 1996). The climate condition in 2014, especially rainfall, is considered to have been more favourable for crop production in the country, except for some areas of the following provinces which faced someproblems of slight mid-season drought occurring in Siem Kampong and Prey Veng province. Project objectives Field demonstrations on integrated technology f or growing mungbeans on sandy soil after wet season rice, including land preparation, planting techniques, application of recommended fertilizerrates, crop management and the released new variety were conducted from 2009 to 2014 in therainfed lowland areas following wet season rice in three provinces (Kampong Thom, Kampot, andTakeo). The objective of this study was to promote growing upland crops in rainfed lowland areas, improving the livelihood of farmers and increasing their income through growing mungbeansafter harvesting wet season rice. It also focused on improving soil fertility through crop rotation(legumes) in paddy fields to help farmers produce sufficient food for their household and increasecash income through the sale of surplus food. Generally, after harvesting the wet season rice in December, the Cambodian farmer usually leaves the paddy fields fallow because of the shortage of water and a number of other constraints togrowing a second crop. The results of recent research conducted by CARDI indicate thatmungbeans and peanuts are the high-yielding potential crops suitable for growing on the sandysoil in the rainfed lowland areas after harvesting the wet season rice. However, soybeans are alsoa high-yielding potential crop suitable for growing on upland rainfed lowland areas. Since 2009, CARDI released - CMB1, CMB2, CMB3 and CARDI's Chhey - that can be grown after harvesting the wet season rice. These are short-duration varieties withgrowth duration ranging from 50 to 55 days with an average yield of 850 kg/ha. The yield can beas high as 1 900 kg/ha with application of recommended crop management practices, and thefarmer can keep the seed for growing in next season. In addition, farmers can benefit from thehigher market prices of mungbeans that prevail during the harvesting time. Results As is evident from Figure 1, the application of CARDI's technology package produced grain yieldof mungbeans at 561 kg/ha averaged over 23 sites. However, there is potential to increase the yieldlevel to 1 ,062 kg/ha if farmers apply good management practices. The grain yield obtained in the trial was nearly double what farmers harvested (275 kg/ha) with their traditional practices andvarieties (Figure 1). Economic analysis revealed tha t the gross income rec eived from CARDI's technology package was 2.93 million Riel/ha, while the gross income received from farmers'practice with farmers variety treatment was only 1.07 million Riel/ha (Figure 1). Apart from fieldVI. Country status reports 53Conclusion and recommendations The results of field demonstration showed that with the application of C ARDI's technology package, farmers obtained an average 561 kg/ha grain yield of mungbeans. However, with proper crop management practices yield increased up to 1 062 kg/ha. The average grain yield was nearlydouble compared with only 275 kg/ha obtained using farmers' traditional practices. Similarly, grossincome also doubled to 2.93 million Riels/ha with the use of CARDI's technology compared with1.07 million Riels/ha obtained using traditional practices only. Apart from field demonstrations, farmer field schools were conducted on land preparation, planting techniques, recommended fertilizer rates, water and pest management, and post-harvesttechnology in the target areas attended by 760 participants. Besides, a farmers' field day wasorganized. Based on information obtained from interviewing 350 households, it was evident thatmost farmers were interested in growing mungbeans after wet season rice using new integratedtechnology package. Moreover, mungbean growing on the sandy soil in the rainfed lowland areasafter harvested wet season rice can help farmers produce sufficient food for their household andincrease cash income year round and improve soil fertility through crop rotation (legumes) andmulticropping in paddy field.Figure 1.

Country status reports 5555Xuxiao Zong and Tianfu Han Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China Abstract China has vast territory with diverse ecological conditions where more than 20 pulse species are grown. Rotation, intercropping and mixed cropping involving pulses are the normalcropping systems. China became a member of the WTO in 2001, which affected the productionstatus of pulses with sharp increases in production of green pod and a slight reduction in drygrain production of pulses. The research and ex tension system for pulse crops production chain have shifted their efforts to the newly emerged demands for research, breeding, productionand consumption of pulses. Introduction China has vast territory, diverse ecological conditions and a great variety of pulse species. The mainpulse crops grown in the country are: pruriens Utilis (Wall. ex Wight) Baker ex Burck), lupine (Lupinus L.), etc. In China, peanuts are not included in pulses or food legumes, but in oil crops. Soybeans originated in China, mungbeans and adzuki beans partially originated in China, faba beans and peas were cultivated for longer than 2 000 years; Common beans, cowpeas, chickpeasand lentils were cultivated for hundreds of years. Pulses play an important role in cropping systemin China for traditional and sustainable agriculture since ancient times. Pulses are also the keycomponents in dietary protein, vitamin B, and diversified recipes in ordinary food dishes. Thistraditional preparation ensured the basic health of Chinese people. Trends in pulse area, production and productivity Production of pulses in China The status of pulse production in China averaged over 2004-2013 is shown in Table 1.Recent achievement in research and development of pulses in ChinaProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 56Currently, China is one of the biggest producers of pulses in the world. The contribution of China in the global output of pulses is shown in Table 2. Except soybeans and peas, other pulses listedin Table 2 yielded higher than the world average levels.Table 1.

Pulses are favourites in the daily life of the Chinese people and were important in the history of crop production in China. Since 2001, the import of pulse grains from USA, Brazil, Argentina andCanada was increasing year by year. Pulse grain production is declining gradually and theproportion of vegetable pulse production sharply increased during the past 15 years (Table 3).Because of the short crop duration and high market value, peas and common beans becamedominant in vegetable pulse production in China. Vegetable soybeans and faba beans arefollowing the same trend as peas and common beans.VI. Country status reports 57Distribution of pulses in China Pulse crops can be found in all provinces, autonomous regions and suburban regions of big cities in China, but most pulses are distributed unevenly (Table 4).Table 3.

Cereals are the best crops for rotating with soybeans. Intercropping and mixed-cropping Soybeans are also grown as an intercrop with maize in eastern provinces such as Shandong, which produces higher total production per unit area than monocropping of soybeans or maize. Faba beans and peas Rotation Faba beans and peas are preferred crops for rotation with rice, cotton, maize, sweet potato, tobacco in winter-sown areas; they are rotated with wheat, barley, canola, peas, vetch and lucerne in spring-sown areas of China. Intercropping and mixed-cropping Faba beans and peas are often intercropped with with wheat, canola, potato; they are also planted in rows between fruit trees, tee trees and mulberry trees for vegetable production. Chickpeas and lentils Rotation Chickpeas and lentils are rotated with wheat, sorghum, cotton in spring-sown areas; and with sugarcane and rice in winter-sown areas. Intercropping and mixed-cropping Chickpeas and lentils are grown as intercrop and mixed crop with barley, wheat, sorghum, peas, flax, canola, saffron. Common beans Rotation Common beans are a good rotating crops with whea t, maize in maize and wheat production areas like Heilongjiang province and Shanxi province. Intercropping and mixed cropping Common beans are intercropped with maize, cotton and potato; it is also planted in rows between fruit trees and timber trees, for fallow land utilization. Mungbeans and adzuki beans Rotation Mungbeans and adzuki beans are good rotating crops with wheat in wheat production areas, such as Hebei province, Shandong province and Henan province.VI. Country status reports 59Intercropping and mixed-cropping Mungbeans and adzuki beans are intercropped with maiz e, sorghum, cotton, sweet potato, sesame, millet; they are also planted in rows between fruit trees and timber trees, for fallow land utilization. Major achievements in increasing pulse production and productivity Research on pulse crops in China is mainly conducted by the Chinese Academy of AgriculturalSciences (CAAS), provincial agricultural academies, prefecture-level institutes and agriculturaluniversities. Recently, some enterprises have invested in pulse breeding. The crop germplasm wascollected and conserved in the Institute of Crop Sciences of CAAS, some provincial agriculturalacademies and a few universities. Pulse crop breeding In the past 50 years, China released more than 2 ,300 improved pulse varieties. The varieties of major pulses were replaced several times. Up to 2014, 2 ,064 soybean varieties were approved by MoA or provincial governments for release. At present, improved varieties occupy 90 percent ofthe total area under soybean cultivation in China. The varieties were replaced five to seven timesin the northeast, four to six times in the Yellow-Huai-Hai Rivers Valleys and three to five times inthe south. Since 1949, significant advances have also been achieved in the breeding of mungbeans,broad beans, peas, common beans and other pulses. The varieties of pulse crops released in Chinaare shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Crop management optimization Pulse-based cropping systems for monocropping, intercropping and mixed cropping have beenoptimized during the past ten years, supported by the China Agriculture Research System (CARS).Optimized packages for soybean, faba bean, pea, common bean, mungbean, adzuki beanproduction in their major production areas in China are available. Constraints in productivity enhancement and emerging challenges Export and import trade of pulses in China re-statued their production Crops are important items in international trade for China, and pulses played major roles in thetrade of agricultural products. The import and export of some pulses and their products in 2012is shown in Table 7. China exported faba beans and adzuki beans to Japan, European countries and,Southeast Asian countries. The imported soybeans were mainly from the USA, Brazil and Argentina. Imported dry soybeans and dry peas dominated the market, which greatly reduced the income of smallholder producers of dry soybeans and dry peas. This obviously reduced sowing area ofsoybean and peas for dry grain production in China.VI. Country status reports 61Climate change reduced pea and faba bean production in winter-sown areas Since 2005, because of climate change rainfall in the main production areas of faba beans and peas, such as the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan, significantly decreased during the croppingperiod affecting the winter-sown areas. As a result, the cropped area and productivity of faba beansand peas decreased sharply. In areas like Wenshan prefecture in Yunnan province, dry peaproduction declined to 30 percent from the original area in 2005. Strong competition with maize has sharply reduced sowing area for soybeans, mungbeansand adzuki beans Since hot season pulses like soybeans, mungbeans, adzuki beans and cowpeas, are grown in thesame season as cereals, the C4 maize has dominant competitiveness over hot season pulses. Thisresulted in a sharp reduction of soybean, mungbean, adzuki bean and cowpea sowing areas intheir traditional production provinces. Current efforts for improving pulse productivity Shift production of soybeans, peas, common beans and faba beans for dry grain to greenpods Green pod production holds the potential for increasing income of smallholder farmers becauseof its higher market price than that of dry grain soybeans, peas, common beans and faba beans,as well as shorter crop duration for green pod production. Frmers tend to switch to green podproduction in traditional soybean, pea, common bean and faba bean growing areas. So, thebreeding and research efforts shifted to developing varieties suitable for green pod production ofsoybeans, peas, common beans and faba beans. Explore new areas for green pod production of peas and faba beans Global warming has opened opportunities for winter cultivation of peas and faba beans intraditional spring-sown areas for green pod production. Since 2009, CAAS screened 4 ,000 accessions each of pea and faba bean germplasm from vast geographical origins globally. Strongtolerant accessions or winter hardy accessions were selected for breeding programmes of peas andfaba beans.Table 7.

Improved pulses were introduced into theseareas three years ago by CAAS and YAAS cooperative programme. The preliminary results showeda promising future for chickpea production in the above provinces. Suitability of pulse for conservation agriculture Traditional crop rotation, intercropping, and mixed cropping systems including pulses provedsuitable for conservation agriculture in China. Pulses produce nitrogen fixation nodules, which canbe self-sufficient for N supply and also serve as N fertilizer providers for their companion crops inthe cropping systems. Contributions of pulses to nutrition, employment and income generation, and value chain development Soybeans Soybeans are one of the major plant protein sources in the Chinese diet. In the daily life of Chinese people, tofu, soybean sprouts, soybean milk, soy sauce, fresh or frozen soybean pods are popularnon-staple foods. Soybean oil is the main plant-derived edible oil in the country, second only topalm oil. In recent years, the consumption of soybean products increased dramatically and a largeamount of soybeans and soybean products were imported. At present, China is the biggest buyerof soybeans in the world with over 60 percent market share of the global soybean export market. Peanuts Peanuts are used for production of edible oil, for favourite snack foods and nuts. Peanuts are alsoused as important components in the preparation of various kinds of cakes, sweets, soups, andtraditional local foods in China. Other pulses The food made from the other pulses are favorites of Chinese people. The main types of this kindof food are as follows: Staple food: grinding to flour, mixing with wheat or maize flour to make various staple foods; or adding to rice or maize to cook rice meal or gruel. Sometimes the pulses are used solely to makefood. Non-staple food: mungbeans, broad beans and peas can be used to make starch noodles; green peas, green faba beans, green chickpeas are high quality vegetables for cooking dishes;mungbeans sprouts and lentil sprouts, fresh pods of some pulses are popular vegetables in Chinatoo. The tonic and medicinal value of some pulses According to traditional Chinese medicine, balanced nutrition is the basis of health. Pulse cropswith different nutritional and chemical compositions are highly regarded as healthy food. Someof them are used as tonics or even medicine. Table 8 shows the tonic and medicinal values of somepulse crops according to traditional Chinese medicine.VI. Country status reports 63Strategy for meeting the future opportunity and challenges Research on genetic resource development for specific traits of economic interest While developing pulse genetic resources, researchers are primarily interested in such traits as drought tolerance, heat tolerance, and winter hardiness. CAAS and provincial research groups onpulses should strengthen their efforts to meet the future needs of breeding programmes. Breeding for abiotic tolerance and for green pod production The demand for new varieties that are tolerant to drought and heat, with winter hardiness andsuitable for green pod production ranks top among the priorities in pulse breeding programmes.CAAS and provincial breeding teams on pulses should concentrate their efforts on meeting thefuture needs of smallholder farmers. Reaching out to farmers and consumers National platform for release of new varieties has been established by MOA, China The national platform for release of new varieties bred by CAAS and provincial breeding teams hasbeen established by MoA, China in 2014 to meet the needs of pulse varieties for smallholderfarmers, large farmers and seed companies. Smallholder farmers, big farms and seed companiesin China, can visit the government website for detailed information. China Agriculture Research System (CARS) established by MoA, China China Agriculture Research System (CARS) established by MoA in 2008 includes CARS-soybeansystem, CARS-peanut system, and CARS-food legume system. The CARS system provided stablefunding each year that enabled national research scientists working with specific crops toefficiently coordinate ongoing research on breeding, crop management, plant protection, foodprocessing, production chain economy development. It also allowed effective and smooth transfersof research results to farmers, consumers and other actors in commodity value chains. Conclusion The demand for pulse crops is projected to grow significantly along with rising living standardsof the people and increasing awareness about consumption of healthy food. Since China becamea member of the WTO in 2001, the import of soybeans and peas from the USA, Canada, Brazil andArgentina was increasing rapidly which depressed the market price of dry pulses. This has resultedin driving down the returns in domestic production of dry grain of pulses and has decreased ofTable 8.

At the same time, the increasing trend of Chinese consumers to eat traditional food based on vegetable pulses, as well as growing appreciation of the healthbenefits of vegetable pulses has led to a sharp increase in vegetable pulse production in China.This also benefits the cropping systems by reducing crop duration as pulses are grown forconsumption as vegetables. In future pulse-based cropping systems that include dry pulse production will likely to remain static or decline and the vegetable pulse production is likely to increase rapidly. Therefore, breedingresearch on genetic resources and genetic studies in China will be oriented towards supportingvegetable pulse production and will be strengthened at national and provincial levels.VI.

Singh Indian Institute of Pulses Research, Kanpur - 208 024 (U.P .), India Introduction Pulses are the irreplaceable source of dietary proteins in vegetarian diets of the developing countries. The protein content of grain legumes (16-48 percent) is double that of wheat and threetimes that of rice (Rodino et al. , 2011). This makes a diet of pulses complemented with cereals as one of the best solutions to protein-calorie malnutrition. Besides proteins, these are also animportant source of the 15 essential minerals required by man (Wang et al. , 2003). Due to their diverse uses as atmospheric nitrogen fixing agents, green manure and cover crops, catch crops inshort season cropping windows, breakfast grains and ingredients of specialty diets, pulses are animportant subject of agricultural, environmental and biotechnological research (Singh and Pratap,2015). In India, over a dozen pulse crops including chickpeas, pigeonpeas, cowpeas, mungbeans, urdbeans, lentils, French beans, horse grams, field peas, moth beans, lathyrus, etc. are grown in one or theother part of the country. However, the most important pulse crops grown in the country arechickpeas (41 percent), pigeonpeas (15 percent), urdbeans (10 percent), mungbeans (9 percent), cowpeas (7 percent) lentils (5 percent) and field peas (5 percent). During the last few years the production of pulses in the country has witnessed an upward trend and it has consistently remained above 18 million tonnes (mt) since 2010. The latest production figure of 19.27 mt for the year 2013-2014 has been an all-time record high. This appears to bea revolutionary moment for the country towards achieving self-sufficiency in pulse productionwhich has been a long pending demand. The scenario was entirely different during the first decadeof this century when the total production of pulses stagnated hovering at around 14-15 mt. Thedeficit was to the tune of 4-5 mt which was mainly filled by imports from other countries. However,the accomplishment of the last few years and tremendous opportunities available for vertical andhorizontal expansion of pulses brighten the prospects for moving rapidly towards achieving self-sufficiency in pulses. The nutritional value of pulses is quite high as compared with most of the cereals. The pulse protein is low in sulphur-containing amino acids but rich in lysine, an amino acid that is deficientin many cereals. Therefore, when pulses are added in cereal-based vegetarian diets, their nutritivequality comes on a par with animal proteins. Pulses are also good sources of the B-group vitaminsapart from riboflavin. Although pulses are devoid of vitamin C, a large amount of ascorbic acid isformed during their germination. During the sprouting process, vitamins, minerals and proteinincrease substantially, with a corresponding decrease in calories and carbohydrate content, whichleads to an improvement in nutritive value and digestibility of the pulses. The ascorbic acid orvitamin C content rises from negligible levels in the seed to 12 mg per 100 g, 18 hours afterPulses in India: current status and way forwardProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 68germination. Riboflavin and niacin content also increase significantly. Sprouted pulses are, therefore, an important food for protection against scurvy. All these changes are brought aboutby the enzymes that become active during germination (Singh and Singh, 1992). Finally, thedigestion of pulses and the absorption of their principal nutrients are practically complete in thegut for people without gastrointestinal disorders. Despite so many advantages, only smallquantities of well-cooked pulses should be included in the diets of patients. Pulses are also a goodsource of fibre. Evidently, those pulses that are consumed with the seed coat on, such asmungbeans, lentils, chickpeas, etc. are much higher in dietary fibre than those that have beendehulled before consumption. Statistics on pulse cultivation India has been a world leader in production as well as consumption of pulses. During2012-2013, the total pulse production in India was 18.34 mt (up by 7.3 percent over the previousyear) which further increased by another 5.07 percent in 2013-2014 with a production of 19.27 mt.This positive trend in production has been sustained over the last four years. After 2000-2001, thearea under pulses grew significantly at 1.17 percent annually, although it was not significant in thepreceding three decades between 1970 and 2000. Similarly, the growth in production as well asproductivity between 2000 and 2012 was also positive and higher than that of the preceding threedecades. Remarkably, the growth rate in pulse production (2.61 percent) during this decade has been even higher than the growth rate of rice (1.59 percent), wheat (1.89 percent) and all cereals together(1.88 percent). Among pulse crops, the annual growth rate in production was highest in chickpeas(5.89 percent) followed by pigeonpeas (2.61 percent). A number of factors contributed toa significant rise in production in these crops including the concerted efforts of researchers,involvement of various government agencies, policy makers and the pulses growers, and thebenefit of favourable environmental conditions. More than 550 improved varieties in differentpulses, availability of their quality seed, improved pulse production and protection technologies,active government involvement and policy support fuelled an upward growth in pulse productionin India. Chickpeas contributed the most in increased production, which witnessed a recordproduction of 9.93 mt during 2013-2014. Import-export status Notwithstanding the impressive growth of pulse production in the country, import has also showna positive trend over the years while exports remained almost stagnant. With a growth rate of 9.09percent for the import of pulses between 1981 and 2012, the growth in terms of value of importswas 16.26 percent. But it has slowed down to 12.16 percent after 2000-2001. This downward trendwas due to an increase in the production of pulses in the country as well as an imposition ofa ban on the export of pulses from India since 27 June 2006, except for the export of commerciallyimportant kabuli chickpeas and 10 000 tonnes of organic pulses and lentils. Owing to these factors, the growth in export of pulses was observed to be negative (-2.41 percent) for the period 2000/01-2011/12. The ban on the export of pulses was further extended by a year till March 2014 toenhance the domestic supply. Furthermore, customs duty on the import of pulses had also beenreduced to zero with effect from 8 June 2006 and it was extended up to 31 March 2014. Theseinterventions significantly boosted per capita availability of pulses between 2000 and 2012 withan annual growth rate of 2.10 percent.VI. Country status reports 69Geographical shift The Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of northern India used to be the major pulse basket of the country till the 1970s, followed by a decline of pulse cultivation over the last three decades. The area waslargely replaced by wheat, rice and maize because of increased availability of irrigation facilities.However, this reduction in area under pulses in IGP was compensated by an increase in central andsouthern parts of India. Over the past two decades (1991-2010) Andhra Pradesh emerged as theleader in total pulse production with an average increase in the yield of chickpeas and pigeonpeas,two major pulses, by about 81-100 percent. Consequently, the total pulse area in central andsouthern India increased from 11.34 million hectares (mha) to 15.01 mha during the last threedecades. The short duration chickpea varieties developed by ICAR-NARS-ICRISAT collaborationplayed a key role in expanding the area and productivity of chickpeas in southern India. Similarly,the area of lentils increased significantly in Madhya Pradesh, and pigeonpeas in Andhra Pradeshand Karnataka. Development and adoption of appropriate varieties led to increased area,production and yield of lentils in Jharkhand and Rajasthan. Similarly, the cropped area undermungbeans and urdbeans showed an upward trend in north India which almost doubled alongwith a significant increase in productivity. During the XI Plan period alone, production and productivity of total pulses increased significantly in Jharkhand, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. In chickpeas, there was a positive growth in area,production and productivity in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. Production of pigeonpeas rose by about 0.253 million tonnes (mt) in Karnataka, 0.126 mt in Gujarat and 0.113 mt inAndhra Pradesh. Similarly, the area under pigeonpeas increased significantly by 113 ,000 ha in Karnataka, and 74 ,000 ha in Andhra Pradesh. The development of short-duration varieties ushered in expansion of summer season cultivation of mungbeans in the rice-wheat cropping system innorth India. Similarly, Uttar Pradesh recorded a significant expansion of the area under peas by117 ,000 ha and production by 180 ,000 tonnes. Constraints to increasing pulse production The area under pulse cultivation in the country is estimated to be about 25-26 mha and therealized productivity is less than 1 tonne/ha. The shortfall in pulses has been attributed toa number of factors. The major factors being ever-increasing population, geographical shift, abruptclimatic changes, complex disease-pest syndrome, socio-economic conditions of the farmers andfewer market opportunities (Singh and Pratap, 2014). Since major pulses are largely cultivated inrainfed and monsoon-dependent areas where soil moisture is the critical factor determining theproductivity, the production trends keep fluctuating every year depending upon rainfall. The majorconstraints to realizing the potential yield of pulses include biotic and abiotic stresses prevalentFigure 1.

Among biotic stresses, fusarium wilt coupled with root rot complex is probably the most widespread disease causing substantial lossesof chickpeas. While fusarium wilt, sterility mosaic and phytophthora blight cause substantial lossesin pigeon peas, yellow mosaic, cercospora leaf spot and powdery mildew are considered as themost important diseases in both mungbeans and urdbeans. In lentils, the rust, powdery mildewand wilt cause considerable damage. Among key insect-pests, gram borer ( Helicoverpa armigera ) in in pigeon peas, whitefly, jassids and thrips in dry beans cause severe damage to the respective crops. Weeds also cause substantial loss to pulses.Recently, nematodes have emerged as a potential threat to the successful cultivation of pulses inmany areas. Among abiotic stresses, drought and high temperature at the terminal stage, cold as well as a sudden drop in temperature coupled with fog during the reproductive phase and salinity/alkalinity throughout the crop period inflict major yield losses and instability in production. All these stresses make pulse crops less productive with unstable performance in one or the other way. Factors responsible for the revolution in pulse production Besides soil and climatic factors, the non-availability of quality seeds in adequate quantity was oneof the major constraints in pulses production in India till now. Seed replacement rate was also verylow (5 to 10 percent) and recurrent unfavourable weather conditions and gaps in technologicalknow-how further added to the constraints in pulse production. Realizing this, with technologicalback up and interventions of the National Agricultural Research System and the well plannedfinancial support of the Planning Commission and Ministry of Agriculture, Govt. of India, severalprogrammes viz., National Villages, etc. were launched during the XI Plan period to boost pulse production with an objective to add 2 million tonnes of pulse grainsto the current production in the country. Situation-specific, cost effective and system-basedtechnological know-how and a package of practices in pulses were disseminated among thefarmers through farmers' participatory research and extension (FPRE), on-farm demonstrations,frontline demonstrations, and skill-based training to bridge the gap between potential and realizedyield in pulses. Inclusion and adoption of improved varieties of different pulse crops under differentfarming systems also helped increase productivity per unit area. The policy initiatives such asincreasing the minimum support price by the government encouraged farmers to take up pulsecultivation as a profitable venture. The breeder seed production was doubled which ensuredavailability of quality seed of pulses in sufficient quantities. The seed supply model has beenpractically successful and it led to one important step forward towards this transformation. Allthese efforts together have undoubtedly resulted in yielding encouraging results and enhancingpulse production in the country. Besides the above factors, moderate to good monsoons andeffective farm-oriented government policy support have also had their share in this success. Technology initiatives An aggressive research and development approach has been adopted in pulses in the countryduring the last three decades. A large number of region-specific and widely adapted high yieldingvarieties of pulses with tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses have been developed in the past30 years. Intensification of pulse-based cropping syst ems and development of modern production and protection techniques have led to a better technical know-how on increasing the productivityof pulses. The whole genome sequencing of pigeon peas and chickpeas has widened the scopeof targeting loci controlling complex traits such as stress tolerance and yield and nutritional qualityimprovement paving the way for development of varieties with desired attributes. Transgenicdevelopment against pod borer in chickpeas and pigeonpeas is underway. At the same time,VI. Country status reports 71efficient extension models like pulse-seed-village have been implemented for dissemination of pulse-based technologies for farmers to make pulse cultivation in the country productive andremunerative. The other major technologies to bridge yield gaps include availability of quality seeds of high yielding and input responsive varieties of different pulse crops, identification of suitable pre- and post-emergence herbicide molecules for effective control of weeds, suitable micro-irrigationsystems, modern agronomic practices viz., raised bed planting, ridge sowing, optimum utilizationof nutrients and interculture practices, use of farm machinery and equipment for efficient farmoperations and reducing drudgery, and state-of-art food processing and post-harvest handlingunits of farm produce. Development of bio-intensive eco-friendly IPM modules to effectivelymanage major insect pests and diseases have had complimentary effects in the form of effectivecontrol of pests as well as saving the environment. Several new research initiatives have also been taken up viz., development of new plant types for different agro-climatic situations, exploitation of heterosis in pigeonpeas through development ofcytoplasmic male sterility-based hybrids, transgenic development in chickpeas and pigeon peasfor managing Helicoverpa pod borer, marker-assisted selection for introgression of resistance genes and characterization of biotic and abiotic stresses that are expected to have tremendous impactson improving productivity of pulses in the country. The way ahead The requirement of pulses has been projected to reach 32 million tonnes by 2050 taking intoaccount the estimated growth of the population to 1.69 billion by 2050 and the availability ofproteins in diets from some other sources such as milk products. Reaching this goal requires annualproduction of pulses to grow at 2.2 percent against the current growth rate of 3.5 percent. Thistarget seems to be well within reach despite myriad looming challenges such as climate change-driven distribution of rainfall and temperatures, decreasing water and land resources,etc. A tangible step in this direction will be increasing the average productivity of pulses above1 ,200 kg/ha and bringing an additional area of about 3.5 mha area under pulse cultivation. Reducing post-harvest losses to the tune of 10-15 percent from current losses will also addanother 1 mt of pulse grains to our kitty. Vertical expansion of pulses in the country through yield enhancement can be achieved by development of input-responsive and climate-resilien t varieties of pulses, varieties with multiple resistances to diseases and insect pests, short-duration varieties that fit well in different croppingsystems and increasing the harvest index. Similarly, development of new plant types for differentagro-climatic situations, and development of photo-thermo insensitive cultivars in crops likemungbeans and urdbeans will help expand the areas of these crops in the non-traditional areasof the country. This will also help develop varieties which could perform equally well over differentseasons and locations.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 72References Rodi\u00f1o, A.P ., Kumar, J., De La Fuente, M., De Ron, A.M. and Santalla, M. 2011.

Rozi Indonesian Legume and Tuber Crops Research Institute, Agricultural Agency for Research and Development of Indonesia, Indonesia Abstract Pulses, a group of food legumes, hold considerable potential for development in Indonesia. The high nutritional value of pulses as a cheaper source of vegetable protein can make them idealfor people who can't afford animal protein. Few pulses can be used as a substitute for soybeansin making several processed food products, so they can potentially reduce the domesticsoybean demand which is increasing every year. Pulse crops are also useful for increasing soilfertility because they can fix nitrogen from the air thus reducing the requirement for syntheticnitrogenous fertilizers. Pulses are usually cultivated as minor priority crops on marginal landduring the late dry season on wet land or the late rainy season on upland. Research and development on pulses is still limited. T he constraints to pulse development trace their origin to agro-ecological factors, production systems, farmers' socio-economic conditions,product development, and marketing. Breeding research on pulse in Indonesia is focused ondeveloping and releasing new varieties with high yield potential for various sub-optimalagroecologies, early maturity, and resistance to pests and diseases. Research on mungbeansattracts priority over other pulses. Because pulses are not considered as staple foods, seriousattention and efforts are needed to raise the status of pulses in Indonesia which is nowconsidered neglected crop. Opportunities to improve productivity and production of pulses lie in modernizing breeding programmes to develop and release new varieties, organizing quality seed production,implementation of the full recommended technology packages, and their rapid disseminationto farmers. Post-harvest research especially on the development of pulse-based food productsremains central to driving the market demand or pulses. The development of potential areasfor expanding pulse cultivation should be directed to provinces with the most favourableagro-ecological conditions, such as Bali, East Nusa Tenggara, Yogyakarta, West Java, Central Java,East Java, and South Kalimantan. Introduction Feeding a growing world population is critical to maintaining food and nutrition security, includingeradicating hunger in some parts of the developing and underdeveloped world. It means not onlycarbohydrates need to be supplied sufficiently, but the diets must also contain lipid and proteinfor a healthy and productive life.Recent achievement in research and development of pulses in IndonesiaProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 74In Indonesia, soybeans are the source of vegetable protein for most people in the form of processed foods - 'tempe' and 'taucho' (fermented soybeans), 'tahu' (tofu), and 'kecap' (soysauce) - which are very popular. Because of shortages in domestic grain production of soybeans, arround1.2 million tonnes of soybeans are imported per year. The government is now emphasizingincreasing soybean production to meet self-sufficiency by 2017. Pulses are also popular in the country for many other uses, such as vegetable and processed food. Indonesian farmers grow a wide range of pulse crops, such as pigeonpeas and Somaatmaja, 1992). In general, pulses can be used for food, feed and raw material for industrial products. Besides, these crops play an important role in improving soil health, maintaining long-term fertility andsustainability of cropping patterns. Like other leguminous crops, they meet up to 80 percent oftheir nitrogen requirement by biological nitrogen fixation, and leave behind substantial amountsof residual nitrogen and organic matter for subsequent crops. Also, inclusion of pulse crops incropping systems improves the organic carbon content of the soil. In terms of nutrition, pulses provide protein, complex carbohydrates, and several vitamins and minerals. Like other plant-based foods, pulses contain no cholesterol and little fat or sodium. Pulsesalso provide iron, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc and other minerals, which play a variety of rolesin maintaining good health (Sutanto and Saneto, 1994; Damardjati and Widowati, 1985). InIndonesia, pulses are normally consumed as traditional foods, such as vegetables (young pods, drygrain, sprouts), snacks, and side dishes. The consumption of pulses is far below that of soybeans.Moreover, farmers almost never grow pulses in specific land/area in monoculture system. This isbecause of the government policy which has categorized pulses as minor crops. However, basedon nutrition content and its role as a protein source for the population, we believe that in the nearfuture the government will give higher priority towards the significant development of these minorcrops. Trends in pulse area, production, and productivity Among the various pulses grown in the country, mungbeans ( Vigna radiata ) occupy the largest area. During the last seven years, the cropped area and grain production of pulses showeda decreasing trend. The area declined to 182 075 ha in 2013 from 306 ,207 ha in 2007. During this period, no significant change in productivity of pulses was observed with 1.109 tonnes/ha in 2013as against 1.053 tonnes/ha in 2007 (CBS, 2014). The second area of pulses was undercowpeas ( Vigna unguiculata ) which covered 14 000 ha 0.6 tonne/ha, followed by pigeonpeas ( Cajanus cajan ) with productivity of 0.55 tonne/ha (Manurung, 2002). Mungbeans are cultivated mainly in six provinces, i.e. East Java, Central Java, West NusaTenggara, South Sulawesi, West Nusa Tenggara. The area under mungbeans varieswidely among provinces. In 2013, Central Java accounted for the largest area (57 ,941 ha), followed by East Java (48 ,845 ha) and West Nusa Tenggara (19 ,374 ha). The contribution of these three provinces to total production of mungbeans in Indonesia was 31.4 percent, 28.2 percent, and10.8 percent, respectively (CBS, 2014). Consumption of mungbeans projected for the period2015-2025 is shown in Table 1.VI. Country status reports 75Area under other pulse crops is not well documented. Manurung (2002) reported that some other pulses are grown in several provinces (Table 2).Table 1.

Table 2. Harvested area, productivity, and production of pulses in Indonesia in 1999 Pulses ProvinceHarvested area Productivity Production (ha) (tonne/ha) (tonnes) 000.0 system dynamics Pulse-based cropping patterns vary depending on the land type, such as the paddy field and dry land. In the paddy fields, pulses, especially mungbean, are usually sown after paddy/rice in the dryseason. In dry land, pulses are usually sown during late rainy season after upland rice or after maizeor soybean. The cropping pattern is upland rice - maize - pulses or upland rice - soybean - pulses.This sequencing of pulses in cropping patterns often exposes the growing pulse crop to droughtowing to scarcity of water and the crop becomes prone to pest attacks, mainly thrip (pest) orpowdery mildew (disease). Mungbeans are the major pulse in Indonesia and have become an important component in the cropping pattern, because the crop is sown at the end of the cropping pattern. Furthermore, thecrops must have characteristics of early maturity, resistance to pests and diseases, and toleranceto drought. Especially for mungbeans planted in an area where labour is scarce, the characteristicProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 76of simultaneous harvesting is very important. Pulses which are climbing in growth habit, such as sword beans, lima beans, winged beans and velvet beans are grown in the household garden forvegetable or animal feed. Major achievements in increasing pulse production and productivity The most important technology for increasing crop yield is the use of high quality seed ofimproved variety. This is because a new improved variety is easier to be adopted by farmers thanother technology components. The Indonesian Legumes and Tuber Crops Research Institute(ILETRI) conducts breeding programmes and other research to continuously improve the yieldpotential and other traits of mungbeans. Table 3 lists new improved varieties of mungbeansreleased as of 2014. Few pulses other than mungbeans received meaningful breeding and related research attention. However, at least until 1998, eight new varieties of cowpeas were released in the country(Table 4). In 1987, one variety of pigeonpeas (Mega) were released, which were introduced fromAustralia. Its yield potential was 1.2 tonnes/ha of dry seed, the crop duration 95 days, 100 seedweight 9 to 10 g, and protein content 20 percent. The agronomic research was concerned with development of crop management technology for increasing productivity and production of mungbeans especially in dry land areas. The generalrecomendation is: minimum land preparation, plant population 250 ,000 plants/ha, planting distance 40 cm \u00d7 20 cm (2 plants/hill), Urea 25 kg/ha, SP 36-45 kg/ha, and KCl 45 kg/ha. Research for increasing pulse production has also been done by the Directorate of Legume and Tuber Crops,Directorate General of Food Crop by producing pulses in several potential provinces. The extentof pulse cultivation between 2003 and 2011 is shown in Table 5. Table 3.

Country status reports 77Constraints in productivity enhancement and emerging challenges The yield gap (the difference between potential yield and yield realized at farmers' level) in mungbeans is relatively high ranging from 0.8 tonne/ha to 1.5 tonnes/ha. Low average productivityof pulses at the farmer level was due to several factors: (a) recommended technology package is not fully implemented; (b) farmers use uncertified seed; (c) pulses are mostly grown as minor crops because of competition in land uses with other crops; and, (d) farmers perceive little impact from their efforts to enhance the productivity of pulses. Some problems in the development of pulses are: (a) research on identification of these crops is still limited; (b) production, quality, and farming efficiency are low because pulses are considered minor crops; (c) limited capital and accessibility of farmers to resources and technology; and, (d) no market development for pulses because farmers grow these crops only for their own consumption.Table 4.

Exploration of germplasms is, therefore, needed mainly for collecting local and wild varieties to enrich the genesources for traits dealing with biotic and abiotic stresses tolerance. For these purposes, breedingprogrammes should be focused on the development of new varieties having high yield potential,early maturity, biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. In addition, more attention should be given tofunctional food, anti nutrient, toxic compound and feedstuff in these crops. In order to improve production and productivity of pulses in the country, efforts are now focused on the following: (a) crop improvement activity especially for mungbeans to accelerate the release of new varieties with high productivity, resistance to major pest and diseases, and adaptation tosuboptimal land; (b) research on production technology for various agro-ecological conditions; and, (c) dissemination of pulses through field demonstrations and farmers' field days, as well as demonstrations of various pulse-based manufactured food products. Strategy for meeting the future opportunities and challenges The government policy on future development of pulses is paramount to increasing pulseproductivity and production in the country. The opportunities and challenges in developing pulsesshould be reflected in government's policy making for expansion and improvement of cultivationof pulses in the country. These are as follows: Opportunities: (a) Substitution material for soybeans; (b) the requirements of raw material for industrial purposes keep increasing; (c) pulses have advantages as functional food because they are rich in protein, vitamins, and some minerals for a more healthy life; (d) pulses have various derivative products which are useful for food and feed; and, (e) there is still a high yield gap in pulses that can be bridged to increase production. Challenges: (a) Subsistence and speculative nature of pulse cropping; (b) profit is not the main target for farmers; (c) minimal use of production input; (d) land is limited and less fertile; (e) low capital ownership (poor farmers); (f ) commodity market is not yet formed; (g) pulses are not considered as staple foods; and, (h) pulses are neglected crops. Based on the above opportunities and challenges, the following should be key elements in formulating the strategy for long-term development of pulses in the country: 1. maximizing land use by increasing cropping index and utilizing unused land; 2. dissemination of production technology to increase productivity and also processing; technology to develop pulse-base food products;VI. Country status reports 793. introducing and promoting the consumption of pulse-based food products in the country; 4. development of markets for pulses; and, 5. improvement of seed production to expand the use of quality seed by farmers. Surveys for the development of pulses have already been conducted. Areas (districts and provinces) which are suitable and have potential for the development of pulses in Indonesia areshown in Table 6. Table 6. Provinces and districts suitable for developing pulses Manurung (2002) Contribution to nutrition, employment and income generation, and value chain development, including processing and marketing Legumes, including pulses play an important role in the Indonesian diet as an excellent source of protein. The contribution of legumes to daily protein intake was about 9 percent, ranking thirdafter rice and fish. In comparison with animal protein sources, such as fish and meats, legumes arerelatively inexpensive. Among all legumes, soybeans have the highest protein content, rangingfrom 30 to 45 percent, while pulses, such as mungbeans, cowpeas, pigeonpeas and jack beanscontain moderate amounts of protein (22-30 percent) as presented in Table 7. The protein qualityof legumes is not as good as that of animal products due to limited content of sulphur-containingamino acids (methionine and cystine) and tryptophan (Iqbal et al. , 2006). However, they are rich in lysine, which is usually limited in cereals. Therefore, a diet combining legumes and cereals can properly supplement the limited essential amino acids in both commodities. The protein digestibility is also poor due to the presence of antinutritional factors, such as trypsin inhibitors and phytic acid that may bind protein to form complexundigestible compounds. This affects the protein availability and absorption in the gastrointestinaltract. However, the activities of these anti-nutritional factors can be normally reduced duringprocessing, particularly through soaking and cooking/boiling. Legumes are also rich sources of fats,carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals (Table 7).Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 80Groundnuts have the highest fat content, up to 50 percent, followed by soybeans and lupins. Meanwhile, pulses contain very low fat and fairly high starch, thus belong to starchy legumes. Thisshows the great potential of pulses as a source of energy supply. Vitamins, such as vitamin A, E, K,and B, particularly thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and folate are considerably high in legumes as wellas minerals, such as calcium, phosphor and iron. Pulses, particularly mungbeans, cowpeas,pigeonpeas are rich sources of folates which are essential for preventing megaloblastic anemia andneural tube defects, particularly in new-born babies (Bower, 1996 in Ginting and Arcot, 2004). Pulses are known to have low glycemic indexes (GI) that is <50 (Rizkalla et al. , 2002). GI refers to the blood glucose raising potential of carbohydrate foods, which is low if the value is <55. This isessentially needed for diabetic and obese patients to control or maintain normal blood glucoselevels. High amylose and fiber content as well as the presence of natural enzyme inhibitors, suchas a-amylase and a-glucosidase in legumes make the carbohydrate slow to digest, thus effectivelylowering the GI (Sievenpiper et al. , 2009). Other functional ingredients are high dietary fiber in legumes (average 36.5 percent) and resistant starch, particularly in pulses (average 24.7 percent) (Ofuya and Akhidue, 2005), which havehypocholesterolaemic effects (Anderson and Major, 2002). This prevents cardiovascular disease andprebiotic potential that promote large bowel health and prevent colorectal cancer (Fuentez-Zaragoza et al., 2010). Bioactive components, such as isoflavones, phenolic compounds, flavanoids, tannins are responsible for legume antioxidant capacities (Xu and Chang, 2007). Some pulses, suchas lentils, red kidney beans and black beans as well as black-seeded soybeans showed considerablyhigh total phenolic content, while it is approximately 2 to 3-fold lower in yellow-seeded soybeans,chickpeas and yellow peas. The health benefits of each functional component in legumes aresummarized in Table 8.Table 7.

Country status reports 81In Asia, Japan and Indonesia have the highest consumption of soybeans, while India leads in consumption of pulses such as chickpeas, pigeon peas, blackgrams and mungbeans. The status ofconsumption of other pulses is not well documented in national statistics. That might be due toinsignificant area under cutivation and limited consumption. FAOSTAT (2013) reported theconsumption of pulses in Indonesia as low as 0.09 kg/capita/year. Pulses are normally consumed as traditional foods, such as vegetables (young pods, dry grain, sprouts), snacks, and side dishes. These limited food products may contribute to a decrease inconsumption of pulses as they are less interesting and less practical in preparation. Therefore,efforts should be focused on developing more acceptable products both for householdconsumption and industrial purposes. In relation to importing a large amount of soybeans,particularly for tempe and tofu ingredients, selected pulses can be used as a substitute forsoybeans in particular products, such as tempe, tofu, soymilk, and soy sauce to some extent,depending upon the product and kind of pulses. Cowpeas can substitute 100 percent of soybeansin tempe and 20 percent in tofu prepar ation (white-seeded cowpeas), while it can substitute only 30 percent for pigeonpea tempe (Haliza et al. , 2007). However, pigeonpeas as well as cowpeas and lab lab beans can be used 100 percent as ingredients of sweet soy sauce (Antarliana et al. , 1997). Jack beans have also potential as a substitute for soybeans in tempe (50 percent) and tofupreparation (IAARD, 2014). A number of studies also reported the potential use of pulses asingredients in different kinds of food both using dry grain or flour. Table 9 presents existing ortraditional food products derived from pulses in Indonesia and promising newly developedproducts in order to broaden the utilization of pulses. Processing of pulses into different kinds of food products using simple techniques is expected to enhance household consumption and subsequently increase its nutritional status. This is essential,particularly in the dry areas where pulses can be potentially grown and further developed usingimproved varieties and proper cultivation practices . East and West Nusa Tenggara provinces which belong to such areas, currently show a high prevalence of malnutrition (Figure 2), and thereforeneed to be considered for pulse development in Indonesia. Pulses can be introduced in other areaswith high malnutrition prevalence, such as West Papua, Maluku, and West Sulawesi in order toimprove their nutritional status. In particular for Papua and West Papua areas where the mainstaple food is sweet potato, the consumption of legumes and pulses is essentially needed tobalance their nutrient intake which is mainly based on a carbohydrate diet.Table 8.

These products can be sold at school and government office canteens,local markets, bus terminals, etc. or in collaboration with the local government authoritiespulses-based snacks can be provided for their internal meetings or events made by these womenprocessors. The government of Indonesia has established the President Instruction No. 29 in 2009concerning the acceleration of local-based food diversification which would be in accordance with this pulse product development.Table 9.

Country status reports 83Therefore, socialization and promotion of the health benefits of pulses and their varied food products as well as extension and training on the preparation methods need to be conductedunder the coordination of the local government. However, the availability of pulses as rawingredients should be guaranteed through continuous supply. Consequently, farmers would beencouraged to grow pulses and increase the production as the market is available. Conclusion Pulses are important for food, espcially as a protein source for most Indonesian people, as well asfor raw material for manufacturing processed products. The average productivity of pulses atfarmer level is still low due to (a) non-adoption of the full technology package, (b) widespread useof uncertified seed, and (c) strong competition with other crops for land use. Research anddevelopment of pulses is still limited because pulses are mostly cultivated on marginal land,categorized as minor crop and thus remain negelected. The pace of pulse development can be accelerated by improving breeding strategies and the release of new varieties, organizing production of quality seed, facilitating adoption of the fullrecommended technology package, and conducting a well-targeted extension campaign to rapidlydisseminate production technology to farmers. In this context, supportive government policy canprovide a powerful boost to pulse production by according a higher priority to these crops andelevating their status in providing food and nutrition security of the Indonesian people. The abilityof pulses to provide nutrient-rich grain as well as increase soil fertility should be considered andgiven research priority by respective stakeholders.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 84References Anderson, J.W. & Major, A.W. 2002.

Country status reports 8585Sayyed Hossain Sabaghpour Associate Professor Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization, Islamic Republic of Iran Abstract In the Islamic Republic of Iran, among the major pulse crops chickpeas are grown on 550 ,000 ha and lentils on 120 ,000 ha land. Major chickpea (97 percent) and lentil (94 percent) areas are planted under rainfed conditions and are grown in rotation with cereals, mainly wheat andbarley. Beans, faba beans and mungbeans are planted on about 150 ,000 ha under irrigated conditions in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The major constraints influencing the productivity of chickpeas and lentils include poor agronomic practices, drought, heat, ascochyta blight, fusarium wilt and cold. The agronomicpractices for chickpea and lentil cultivation, including date of sowing, seed rate, method ofsowing, plant population, weed control, and method of harvesting have been researched andrecommendations developed for different areas. Improved chickpea varieties (Dorsa, Sadri, Pak and Shekofe) were releasedin last decade. Efforts are being made to transfer these recommendations to farm level withthe help of extension specialists. Research on exploration of the possibility of winter plantingof chickpeas and lentils in milder environments and entzari planting in harsh (severe cold)environments has yielded promising results. Transfer of these technologies to farmers is inprogress and in some areas farmers are getting almost 50 percent or more productivity withthe adoption of winter- or entezari sowing. Research in pulses is conducted by DARI (Dryland Agricultural Research Institute) and SPII (Seed and Plant Improvement Institute) in collaborationwith other research organizations in the Islamic Republic of Iran and with international researchcentres such as ICARDA, ICRISAT and CIAT. Introduction The Islamic Republic of Iran is located in the world's desert belt and is considered an arid andsemi-arid region. The annual precipitation is about 250 mm which is 1/3 of the average worldprecipitation. Though the total land area of the Islamic Republic of Iran is 165 million ha, only 18.7million ha are used for crop production. Out of this cultivated area (Table 1) 6.4 million ha arecultivated under rainfed conditions, only 1.2 million ha of this area receive more than 400 mm ofrainfall; the remaining rainfed areas receive less precipitation. All precipitation is received in theform of snow or rain during winter months and early spring from October to May. There is moisturestress in crop production which is further aggravated by thermal stresses caused by low (down to-30\u00baC) as well as high temperature (>40\u00baC).The status of pulses development in Islamic Republic of IranProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 86Table 1.

Wheat and barley occupy 66 percent of the total area(Table 2). Table 2.

In years of severe drought, wheat yieldgoes down to 500 kg/ha or lower, and crop failures occur in certain areas. Legumes are important in the sustainable production of food and feed in the Islamic Republic of Iran. They are important sources of good quality protein in the diets of people and are valuableas animal feed. Legumes also increase and sustain the productivity of the soil and in rotation withcereal reduce chances of build-up of diseases, insect pests and obnoxious weeds for the followingcereal crops. Pulse uses Pulses produced in the Islamic Republic of Iran are mostly consumed within the country, usuallyproduction is more than sufficient to meet the country's demand (Sabaghpour, 2015b). The excessfood legume production is exported to other countries. Food legumes are used in many dishesbecause of its higher protein content. Chickpeas are eaten as cooked seed with rice and cerealbreads. A popular chickpea and bean dish is \"abgosht\" . Another food in which kabuli type chickpeas and beans are used is \"Aash\" . Desi type chickpeas mainly in form of split peas is used. It is eatenin \"ghymeh khoreasht\" a traditional delicacy eaten with rice. Desi type chickpeas are also used inthe preparation of A popular lentil dish is \"adas polo\" . It is a traditional delicacy eaten with rice. Lentils, beans, faba beans and mungbeans are used in \"Aash.\"VI. Country status reports 87Pulse area and yield in Islamic Republic of Iran Pulses These crops occupied 820 000 ha in 2013 which is 6.3 percent of the country's cultivated area (Anonymous2014). Chickpeas, lentils and beans are grown on 550 000, 120 000 and 98 000 hectares respectivelyin the Islamic Republic of Iran (FAO, 2013). The Islamic Republic of Iran ranks fourth in the worldby areas planted to chickpeas and eighth by areas under lentils. The majority of areas underchickpeas (97 percent) and lentils (94 percent) are planted under rainfed conditions and are grownin rotation with cereals, mainly wheat and barley. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, mean productivityof chickpeas is 536 kg/ha and that of lentils 608 kg/ha compared with the world average of968 kg/ha for chickpeas, and 1 140 kg/ha for lentils. Average yield of chickpeas grown in rainfedareas is 39 percent that of the crop grown with ir rigation. The corresponding figure for lentils is about 41 percent. This highlights the critical role of moisture conservation in rainfed areas in improving the potential pulse yields in such areas. The major reason for low productivity of these crops in the IslamicRepublic of Iran is terminal drought stress. Most of the farmers grow chickpeas and lentils inmarginal areas in the spring season (Sabaghpour, 2015b). In the Islamic Republic of Iran, chickpea areas have decreased from 570 ,000 ha to 550 ,000 ha and lentil areas from 215 ,000 ha to 120 ,000 ha over the last decade. Notwithstanding dwindling rainfall and its uneven distribution,productivity (kg/ha) of pulses over the last decade has increased from 482 to 536 for chickpeasand from 463 to 608 for lentils (Sabaghpour, 2015b). Major production areas of beans, faba beansand mungbeans are equipped with irrigation in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Average productivityof bean in the Islamic Republic of Iran is 791 kg/ha compared with world average of 2 ,582 kg/ha (FAO, 2013). Key constraints to pulse production Drought stress Drought is the common abiotic stress limiting chickpea production in different parts of the IslamicRepublic of Iran. Chickpeas and lentils frequently suffer from drought stress towards the end ofgrowing season after flowering, during pod setting and seed formation. Drought is accompaniedby heat stress in rainfed conditions (Sabaghpour, 2004). Terminal drought stress reducesproductivity of chickpeas considerably in spring planting compared with autumn and entezari sowing. Autumn and entezari planting have comparative advantage over spring planting because of water use efficiency and less vulnerability to terminal drought stress (Sabaghpour, 2002).Research on exploration of the possibility of autumn planting of chickpeas and lentils in milderenvironments and entezari planting in harsh (severe cold) environments has produced promising results. Transfer of these technologies to farmers is in progress and in some areas farmers aregetting almost 50 percent or more productivity with adoption of winter or entezari sowing. Therefore, four chickpea varieties, such as Hashem (Sabaghpour al., 2005), Arman (Sabaghpour et et al., 2015b) and two lentil varieties including Kimiya (Sabaghpour et al., 2013) and Bilesevar (Sabaghpour, 2012) were released for planting in autumn in milder environments and entezari sowing in harsh ( severe cold) environments. Plants adapt to drought environments either through escape, avoidance, or tolerance mechanisms. Drought escape is a particularly important str ategy of matching phonological development with the period of soil moisture availability to minimize the impact of drought stress on crop productionin environments where the growing season is short and terminal drought stress predominates(Turner, 1986).Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 88Drought escape is the most important success for breeders so far in comparison with other mechanisms. Farmers usually are not able to plant chickpeas in the beginning of March due to highmoisture in field. Therefore, they often have to plant chickpeas at the end of March. Flowering inchickpeas starts in the beginning of May when rainfall stops in many years (Sabaghpour et al. , 2006b). But some farmers prefer to plant chickpeas in spring (March) due to weed problems. Majorsuccesses due to breeding have been achieved, in the selection for drought escape. A new droughttolerant chickpea variety \"Sameen\" has been released for planting in spring in cold areas of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Sabaghpour, 2015a). Cold stress Cold stress is one of the most important abiotic stresses in cooler regions of the world. About40 percent of the chickpea crop of the Islamic Republic of Iran is sown in areas susceptible to coldstress (Sabaghpour, 2005). The yield of autumn-planted chickpeas is higher than that of spring-planted due to winter rainfall and higher water use efficiency (Sabaghpour, 2002). The lowestabsolute minimum temperature in cold areas of the Islamic Republic of Iran often occurs inDecember, January and February. Absolute minimum temperatures range from -10\u00baC to -30\u00baC withsnow covering different cold areas of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Because local chickpea and lentilvarieties cannot tolerate cold stress, farmers resort to planting these crops in spring. A newimproved chickpea variety (Saral) has been released for autumn planting in cold areas of theIslamic Republic of Iran. (Glostan), northwest (Oroumieh), west (Kermanshah, Lorestan and Ilam) and southern parts of theIslamic Republic of Iran both in winter and spring planted chickpeas, however it is more severe inwinter sown crop (Sabaghpour 2015b). The disease was reported in 1957 for the first time in theIslamic Republic of Iran (Nori and Shahriyari 1994). Occurrence and severity of this disease dependlargely on the cultivar and weather condition in a given year. Ascochyta blight incidence was100 percent in the epidemic years in farmers' fields on local varieties in the Mediterranean regionof the Islamic Republic of Iran. A survey on aschochyta blight disease conducted in different areasin northwest of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1998 showed 35 percent of chickpea fields hadAscochyta blight incidence in the range of 30 to 80 percent (Akem, 1998). Hashem (Sabaghpour et varieties which are resistant to ascochyta blight with erect growth habit and highpotential yield were released for cultivation in cold, moderate, semi-warm areas of the IslamicRepublic of Iran in the last decade. Ascochyta blight is not important on lentils, beans andmungbeans in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Ascochyta blight and Botrytis are major is another important disease mainly in spring chickpeas in the northwest of the IslamicRepublic of Iran. A survey conducted in 1998 on fusarium wilt disease (Akem, 1998) in north andnorthwest of the Islamic Republic of Iran showed that 19 percent of the chickpea fields havefusarium wilt incidence in the range of 5 to 60 percent. Fusarium wilt incidence in chickpeas wasin the range of 1 to 7 percent in the north (Nasrollah nejad, 1998), 5 to 50 percent in the west inKermanshah Province and 2 to 20 percent in the western provinces of Lorestan and Kurdestan andsouth of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Nori and Shahriyari 1994). A chickpea variety \"Sameen\" ,tolerant to fusarium wilt and drought stress, with large seed size and high yield potential, has beenreleased for planting in cold areas in spring planting (Sabaghpour, 2015a).VI. Country status reports 89Fusarium wilt is a major yield reducer of lentils. In Ardebil province (Bilehsavar), 50 percent of lentil fields had fusarium wilt in the range of 20 to 80 percent in 2002 (Sabaghpour, 2006). A lentil variety\"Bilehsavar\" , tolerant to fusarium wilt, with large seed size and high potential yield, has beenreleased for planting in moderately cold, moderate and semi warm areas of the Islamic Republicof Iran (Sabaghpour, 2012). Rhizoctonia Rhizoctonia solani kuehn is a major yield reducer in mungbeans. The disease was reported in 1967 for the first time in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Rhizoctonia solani incidence in mungbeans was in the range of 4 to 57 percent in the Karaj (Nori and Shahriyari, 1994). Virus Virus diseases are also among biotic stresses limiting bean, chickpea, faba bean, lentil and mungbean production in the Islamic Republic of Iran. In the west of the Islamic Republic of Iran,incidence of virus diseases in chickpea fields ranged between 9.5 percent and 48.9 percent. Yieldlosses were about 20 percent, mainly due to Bean leaf roll virus, Chickpea chlorotic dwarf virus, Faba bean necrotic yellows virus and Beet western yellow virus . Lentil fields surveyed didn't have as extensive disease occurrence as that of chickpea fields. Major virus diseases affecting lentils canbe ranked in the following order based on their frequency of occurrence in the surveyed fields:Pea enation mosic virus, Bean leaf roll virus, Faba bean nerotic yellows virus and Pea seed-borne mosic virus (Sabaghpour, 2006). Pea eantion mosaic virus was found to occur in a high incidence only in the Qazvin-Abhar region (27 percent). Of the fields surveyed, 25 percent had higher than25 percent infection and losses in such fields were likely to be significant (Makouk and Kumari,2001). In surveys conducted in the west of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Kermanshah and Lorestan)the most frequently encountered virus was Been leaf roll virus (Makouk, 2002). Yield losses in mungbeans were mainly due to Mosaic mungbean virus and Alfalfa mosaic virus (Sadri and Ghaffari, 1988). Insect pests Pod borers are the most important insect pest that cause substantial yield losses in chickpeas in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Two species of pod borer Helicoverpa armigera and Helicoverpa viriplaca are found more frequently than other species of the pod borers, however the population of theseinsect species are not similar in different areas. Cutworms, Agrotis spp, are also important pests inchickpeas, lentils and mungbeans. But the pest has a less damaging effect on winter planting ofchickpeas and lentils. Bruchids are another important pest which is found in the stored seeds ofthese food legumes. Leaf miner is another important pest for most important pests for beans and faba beans in the Islamic Republic of Iran (Parsa and Bagheri, 2008). Major yield reducing constraints of food legumes in the Islamic Republic of Iran 1. Poor crop management practices result in soil moisture loss during field preparation, low plant density, late sowing, poor weed control in chickpea and lentil fields. 2. Chickpea local varieties planted in spring in moderate and in Mediterranean climates are susceptible to ascochyta blight. 3. The chickpea and lentil local varieties sown by farmers are susceptible to fusarium wilt. 4. The mungbean local varieties are susceptible to shattering. 5. Farmers are not able to plant chickpeas and lentils in winter or autumn due to cold damage in cold regions in the provinces of Kurdestan, Hamedan, East and West Azarbyjan,Zanjan and Khorasan.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 906. Manual harvesting cost of local varieties is higher as these are prostrate in growth habit and farmers could not harvest chickpeas, lentils, beans and mung beans by combine. 7. Lack of varieties which have resistance to pod borer and leaf miner. 8. Lack of varieties which have resistance to viruses. 9. Lack of varieties which are tolerant to heat stress and soil salinity. 10. Weeds in chickpeas are generally controlled manually rather than by herbicides. Hand weeding is expensive. Moreover, the price of selective herbicide for broad leaves is higherthan herbicides for narrow leaves. 11. Lack of varieties which have resistance to Cutworms. 12. Lack of varieties which have resistance Bruchids. 13. Lack of varieties which have resistance to Acari Tetranychidae. 14. Lack of varieties which have resistance to Aphid. 15. Lack of varieties which have resistance to Botrytis. Strategies for increasing yields Chickpea, lentil and mung bean productivity is low in the Islamic Republic of Iran. To increase seed yield of these crops, the following strategies have been recommended for transfer to farmers. Thesehave been developed and standardized by the pulse research programmes of the country. 1. Minimum tillage should be done for preparing chickpea and lentil fields which will minimize soil moisture loss during field preparation. 2. Optimum date of sowing recommended for different regions and seasons should be followed: The results of the experiment showed that chickpeas planted in autumn produced 71 percent higher yields than the crop planted in spring in Kermanshah. Improved chickpea varieties such asHashem, Arman, Azad, Adel which have resistance or tolerance to aschochyta blight and improvedlentil varieties such as Gachsaran, Kimiya and Bilesevar should be planted in the moderate andMediterranean climate and semi-warm area in autumn. For cold areas, entezari planting (December) in winter may be done for theses varieties or improved chickpea varieties (Sameen) planted inspring. Mungbeans are planted in spring and summer. To obtain optimum yield in both seasonsplanting should be done early. In summer it should be done soon after harvesting cereals. 1. Optimum plant population should be used for local and improved varieties. 2. Optimum quantities of suitable fertilizer recommended for each variety and areas may be used. 3. Improved chickpea varieties such as Hashem, Arman, Azad, Adel all have erect growth habit and are suitable for mechanical harvesting. Strategy for future research 1. Identify varieties with wide adaptability. 2. Develop varieties that have resistance to biotic stresses such as ascochyta blight, cutworms and leafminer. 3. Develop varieties which have tolerance to abiotic stress such as cold, heat, drought and salinity.VI. Country status reports 914. Develop varieties which have high yield and are bold seeded. 5. Develop varieties which have erect growth habit for mechanical harvest. 6. Conduct research on biological control of insect pests such as pod borer, cutworms, leaf miner, acari tetranychidae, aphid, bruchids and leaf miner. 7. Identify effective rhizobia and rhizobial inoculation technique. 8. Identify physiological aspects of yield variation under different environmental conditions, which might be helpful for agronomic manipulations. 9. Following the two-year food legume virus diseases survey in the Islamic Republic of Iran, it is recommended that a long term research plan be developed in order to eventuallymanage the spread of virus diseases in legumes to minimize the losses caused by them,and more importantly to stabilize yields in the regions where virus epidemics are likely tooccur. Strategies for improving agricultural productivity in dry land areas 1. Consolidate land holdings to make better use of agricultural machinery. 2. Formulate suitable policies and strategies for the use of lands with more than an 8 percent slope. 3. Government purchase of new harvesting combines and new seeding drills to replace the old ones. 4. Train drivers of the combines in adjusting the harvester to avoid shattering in wheat and barley. 5. Undertake proactive measures to transfer research results to extension workers and farmers. 6. Invite farmers to Agricultural Research Centers and expose them to the research work being carried out to solve the problems they face. There should be close interactionbetween farmers and extension agents. 7. Pr ovide farmers with new facilities such as the internet to access the latest developments/ technologies for improving agricultural production. 8. Promote farmer's participation in the agricultural scientific meetings, congresses, etc. 9. Ensure farmers receive the same price in gove rnment procurement programme for food legumes from domestic markets as the price paid for importing pulses. 10. Encourage farmers to organize in cooperatives. 11. Organize in-country training for farmers and study visits abroad. 12. Provide farmers with meteorological data for making judicious use of agricultural input. 13. Supply agricultural inputs (water, seed, fertilizer, pesticides) to farmers at prices as low as possible. 14. Undertake measures to provide dry land farmers with long range climate forecasts. 15. Promote suitable research strategies for conservation of soils and other resources.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 92References Anonymous. 2014.

Country status reports 9595Dr Phommy Inthichack1 and Dr Siviengkhek Phommalath2 1 Naphork Agriculture Research Centre, National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute (NAFRI) 2 International Cooperation Division, Department of Planning and Cooperation Abstract Pulses, also called grain legumes, are crops that are harvested solely for the dry seed. In Lao PDR, soybeans and peanuts are also included in the category of pulses. Mungbeans, cowpeas,soybeans and peanuts are the most common grain legumes grown in Lao PDR. The country'stotal agricultural area is 3 ,513 ,234 ha, and the share of cropped area of pulses in total agricltural area is very small with only 0.7 percent for peanuts, 0.25 percent for soybeans and0.08 percent for mungbeans. Qualitative malnutrition is chronic in Lao PDR, and particularly among children under five years of age stunting is common (up to 40 percent). Rice is mainly consumed as a source ofcarbohydrate, while proteins and micro-nutrients are missing in the daily food intake. Pulsesare a primary source of vegetable protein, complex carbohydrates, and several vitamins andminerals and should be promoted in daily food consumption. Farmers widely grow mungbeans on low-lying areas, mostly during the rainy season. Soybeans are grown in rainfed upland areas and irrigated lowland after harvesting rice. Peanuts aregrown on sandy soil along the Mekong river bank and the banks of other major rivers. It is alsogrown, to some extent, in irrigated rice fields, most peanuts are grown in the dry season. The trend of cropped area under pulses keeps changing depending upon market demand and competition with other crops for land use. Productivity remains below the potential yieldbecause of low input usage, especially chemical fertilizers; limited availability of quality seed,poor familiarity with the variety of existing pulse types, and limited use of modern agronomicpractices. The link between the producers and the export markets is weak due to the largenumber of ineffective intermediaries operating in the value chain. While there has beensubstantial growth in recent years, the current export market is underdeveloped. The majorcauses of limited export development are (i) inadequate market intelligence; (ii) inability toleverage scale efficiencies due to smaller size; and (iii) non-conducive business environmentbecause of missing credit and insurance; and (iv) inconsistent policy interventions. The interventions and enabling actions can holistically strengthen the pulses value chain to become more productive and stable, and provide year round transactions that supply domesticand international markets.Recent achievement in research and development of pulses in Lao PDRProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 96Introduction Lao PDR is located in the centre of Indochina sharing borders with China to the north, Myanmar to northwest, Thailand to the west, Cambodia to the south and Viet Nam to the east. It has a totalarea of 236 ,800 square kilometres, with around 70 percent of the terrain being mountainous with maximum elevation of 2 ,820 meters in Xieng Khouang Province. The landscapes of northern Lao PDR and the regions adjacent to Viet Nam, in particular, are dominated by rough mountains.The Mekong river is the main geographical feature in the west and, in fact, forms a natural borderwith Thailand in some areas. The Mekong flows through nearly 1 900 kilometres of Lao territoryand shapes much of the lifestyle of the people of Lao PDR. In the south, the Mekong reachesa breadth of 20 kilometres, creating an area with thousands of islands. As mentioned in the Agricultural Development Strategy to 2020 and vision to 2030 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the government has identified the agriculture and forestry sector asthe priority for food security and commercial agriculture production and connected to povertyreduction in rural areas. Agriculture contributes 23.7 percent to national gross domestic product(GDP), industry 32.2 percent and service 44.1 percent (CIA.GOV, 2014). In mountainous and slopeyareas of northern Lao PDR, rice is grown and yields are low. Some northern upland farmers focuson production of cash crops such as maize, soybeans, peanuts, cotton, sesame, and others.Commercial production of soybeans and peanuts is the potential income source for uplandfarmers. The commercial agriculture production in lowland areas focuses on large scale riceproduction in irrigated areas. According to FAO, the term pulse is reserved for crops harvested solely for the dry seed. This excludes green beans and green peas, which are considered vegetable crops. Also excluded arecrops that are mainly grown for oil extraction (soybeans and peanuts), and crops which are usedexclusively for sowing (clovers, alfalfa). Therefore, several countries do not necessarily declassify thesoybean and other leguminous crops as pulse crops. Pulse is often called grain legume, it is in thebotanical family of Fabaceae (formerly known as the Leguminosae family) and is used for humanfood and animal feed. Mungbeans, cowpeas, soybeans and peanuts are the most common grain legumes considered in Lao PDR. They are widely promoted for commercial production with limited success because theyare mostly grown in home gardens for family consumption. Mungbeans, cowpeas soybeans, andpeanuts are grown as commercial crops in areas well connected to markets. Crops belonging toVigna genus are important in Lao PDR. Among them, V. radiata (mungbean) and V. unguiculata (cowpea) are widely cultivated crops. V. umbellate (rice bean) is a traditional food crop of Lao PDR. Trends in pulse area, production and productivity Cowpeas and rice beans are grown in small gardens for family home consumption, there are no statistic records on the overall area, production and productivity of these crops. Soybeans,mungbeans and peanuts are widely cultivated in large areas on a commercial scale as shown inTable 1. Total agricultural area is 3 ,513,234 ha for upland crop, of which 7 percent is occupied by upland crops, 30 percent by rice, 33 percent by other crops, 1 percent by fruit trees and 29 percentis natural grassland for animal grazing (Deparment of agriculture land management, MAF , 2012).Legumes constitute a negligible share of the total cultivated area: only 0.70 percent for peanuts,0.25 percent for soybeans and 0.08 percent for mungbeans. The largest produciton area of peanutsis in Saravane ( 7 ,135 ha), Champasack (4 ,125 ha) and Xayaboury (3 ,640 ha), of soybeans is in Chamasack (4 ,375 ha), Houaphan (1 ,820 ha) and Oudomxay (1 ,610 ha), and the biggest producer of mungbeans is Champasack (1 ,285 ha).VI. Country status reports 97The trends of production area are changing year by year owing to several factors. The major factor of changing production is market demand setting price and competition with other crops for landuse such as cassava, sugarcane and rubber tree. The productivity of peanuts, soybeans andmungbeans in Lao PDR is much lower than in other countries, so it is not exciting for farmers to grow more or invest in expansion. Pulse-based farming system dynamics There are two growing seasons in Lao PDR , namely rainy and dry seasons. The rainy season starts from May and ends in October and the dry season lasts from November to April (in some yearsraining starts from April). Farmers widely grow mungbeans on low land areas and mostly duringthe rainy season. As for the soybeans, farmers mostly grow soybeans in rainfed upland areas in therainy season and in lowland areas such as irrigated paddy field after rice harvesting (fromDecember to April). Peanuts are grown along the banks of Mekong and other big rivers in sandysoil and also in rice field with irrigated system, most of which is grown in the dry season. In lowlandareas (irrigated rice fields), some farmers practice crop rotation rice-soybean and rice - mungbeanbut only in very small areas. Major achievements in increasing pulse production and productivity Increases in pulse production is achieved through promotion of short-duration pulse crops.A focused attention on Integrated Pest Management has also triggered interest and facilitated theincrease of productivity and production of pulses. Better access to water through irrigation andaccess to quality seeds and credit for growers also are critical factors to the development of pulseproduction. Constraints in productivity enhancement and emerging challenges With regard to the trend above, yield and production of such crops are not contantly increased.They rather fluctuate because of some constraints on cropping. The constraints and challenges canbe both technical and of marketing aspects, among them the following can be mentioned: inadequate availability of quality seeds of improved varieties; prone to pest and diseases and heavy yield losses; inadequate and imbalanced use of nutrients; pulses suffer heavily from soil moisture stress/drought; lack of mechanization; policy does not fully support pulse growers.Table 1.

Introduction of short duration pulses into rice-based cropping systems is recommended but challenges remain for short-maturing pulse varieties between two rice crops, and for adaptabilityto stresses caused by variable weather conditions. Prospects for pulse crops in Lao PDR are constrained by their lower financial attractivenessto farmers relative to other crops, notably maize and rice. The case study conducted in Pek, Kham, Nonghet district, Xiengkhouang province, Lao PDR,showed that diffusion remains constrained by 1) the important initial financial investmentsrequired for establishment and by the limited access to bank credit (high interest rate andtoo short refund period) and 2) villagers' relative lack of experience and limited awarenessand recognition of environmental degradation linked to tillage (most villagers do notunderstand the details of technical aspects (herbicides, equipment, etc.) adoptation istherefore constrained. Current efforts for improving pulse productivity Currently, the Agricultural Research Center (ARC) under the National Agriculture and ForestryResearch Institute (NAFRI) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Lao PDR is conductingresearch on legumes such as germplasm collection and breeding, improving cultivation tehnologyand extension of legumes cultivation. Their collection includes 16 accessions of peanuts,20 accessions of soybeans and 26 accessions of mungbeans, all materials are local and introducedvariety. ARC has improved two new varieties for meduim maturity soybeans combined with highyields. The centre also introduced a new high yield variety from Thailand and Viet Nam for peanuts,soybeans and mungbeans which showed good adaptation to Lao weather conditions. ARC has developed a breeding programme for high yield, early maturity varieties that show tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and are adaptated to a large spectrum of weatherconditions for peanuts, soybeans and mungbeans. ARC has promoted intercropping and croprotation systems on farmer field plots including legumes (peanuts, soybeans and mungbeans) andmajor crops such as rice, miaze and cassava. Also, the ARC has introduced soil nutrient improvmentpractices by using pigeon peas as green manure. ARC in coordination with ICRISAT impmelented Sustainable Management of Crop-based Production Systems for Raising Agricultural Productivity in Rainfed Asia (IFAD Grant Number:I-R-1363-ICRISAT Project). This project has conducted agro ecological analysis, introduced pulsecultivation in dry season irrigated field as crop rota tion, introduced intercropping and the superior varieties of peanuts and pigeon peas. The project also supported capacity building of scientists atthe Agriculture Research Center in Viet Nam and in India for pulse breeding and pulse seedproduction. Suitability of pulse for conservation agriculture Like many leguminous crops, pulses play a key role in crop rotation owing to their ability to fixatmospheric nitrogen. Pulses are considered good 'cover crops' and also one of the crucial elementsof conservation agriculture. Area, production and yield of pulses in Lao PDR vary across the country depending upon the temperature, rainfall and source of irrigation. Most of the pulse crops grown in the rainy seasonVI. Country status reports 99thrive in uplands as rainfed crops with rain water as the source of moisture. Post-rainy season pulses largely grow on conserved moisture with supplemental irrigation. Summer pulses are grownwith supplemental irrigation. Higher soil fertility and high moisture fend off pulse cultivation. Pulse's contribution to nutrition, employment and income generation, and value chain development including processing and marketing Malnutrition is chronic in the Lao PDR, and prevalent particularly among children under 5 years of age resulting in stunting, which is common (up to 40 percent). Proteins and micro-nutrients arelacking in the daily diet intake. Pulses are primary sources of vegetable protein, complexcarbohydrates, and several vitamins and minerals. Like other plant-based foods, they contain nocholesterol and little fat or sodium. Pulses also provide iron, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc andother minerals, which play a variety of roles in maintaining good health. Pulses contain 20 to25 percent protein by weight, which is double the protein content of wheat and three times thatof rice. While pulses are generally high in protein, and the digestibility of that protein is also high,they often are relatively poor in the essential amino acid methionine. Grains (which are deficientin lysine) are commonly consumed along with pulses to form a complete diet of protein. Pulses have significant nutritional and health advantages for consumers. They are the most important dietary predictor of survival in older people of different ethnicities, and in most cases,legume consumption is highly correlated with a reduced mortality from coronary heart disease.Furthermore, pulses are especially high in amylose starch making them a good source of pre-bioticresistantstarch. For people with diabetes, consuming lentils, peas and beans helps control bloodglucose management. Compared with some other carbohydrate sources, pulses have a lowerglycemic index. Studies have also shown tha t consuming pulses can result in more stable blood glucose levels after meals. Consuming pulses can help with weight management. For people trying to lose weight, pulses are high in fibre and protein, low in fat and moderate in calories. One cup of cooked lentils or dry peascontains about half of the daily fibre recommendation for adults. Foods higher in fibre contentusually help people feel \"full\" or satiated at meal time. Strategy to meet future opportunities and challenges Enhancing capcity building on grain legume research such as: Develop human resources for legume breeding and crop managment (recently, ARC hastwo specialists on soybeans no specialist on mungbeans and peanuts). Human resourcesare key to improving productivity. Improve genetic resouces by germplasm collection (local and introduced material) andinduced by crossing and mutation methodology. Improve facility for doing research such as field facility (irrigation system, dry house, seedstorage etc.) and laboratory equipment used for analysing nutrition contained in grainlegumes and molecular markers for plant breeding. Develop education tools (handbook, leaflet, videos etc.) on the advantage of grain legumeconsumption, new technologies on grain legume production and managment andpost-harvest and processing of grain legume technology. These tools will be used fortraining of trainers (TOT), farmers and students at college. Conduct research on grain legume processing and marketing, it will be a way to motivatefarmers to grow more grain legumes. At least they will know how to process legumes fortheir family to increase nutrition consumption.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 100 Lack of pulse value chains and lack of interest of private sector investors to invest in agribusiness value chains is one key constraint to promoting market-linked pulseproduction. Lack of biofertilizer production centres and bio-pesticide production centres are keyconstraints. Reaching out to farmers and consumers A set of constraints hamper the pulse value-chain development with regard to production, bulkingand trading. Production: Productivity is below potential due to low input usage, especially chemical fertilizers; limited availability of seed and limited familiarity with the variety of existingpulse types, and limited usage of modern agronomic practices. Aggregation and trading: The link between the producers and the export markets is weak due to the large number of ineffective intermediaries operating in the value chain.The intermediaries have failed to acquire scale and operate in limited geographic areas.The fragmentation of intermediaries between the producer and consumer markets createsa lack of transparency in markets. Export: While there has been substantial growth in recent years, the current export market is underdeveloped. The major causes of limited export development are (i) inadequatemarket intelligence; (ii) inability to leverage scale efficiencies due to smaller size and(iii) non-conducive business environment due to missing credit and insurance; and(iv) inconsistent policy interventions. Conclusion and recommendations Core interventions and enabling actions can holistically strengthen the pulse value chain so thatit becomes more productive and stable, and provide year-round transactions that supply domesticand international markets. Increase inputs to improve productivity Access to inputs is a key step in bridging the yield gap between current and potential production.Phosphates and other fertilizers should be supplied to farmers, along with knowledge on how touse them effectively. Seed multiplication should be increased to adequately supply the needs ofexporters and domestic demand. Extension should incorporate the agronomy of pulses into thecurriculum. Enhance linkages between exporters and producers Stronger linkages between exporters and smallholders will lead to a more efficient value chainwhere demand signals are clearly communicated to the producers, and where inputs are availableto ensure proper production of pulses designated for export. Actions to enable consistent supplybetween producers and exporters may include: provision of region-specific input packages;development of new varieties appropriate for export; leverage of cooperatives to provideconsistent input supply and off take.VI. Country status reports 101Provide adequate markets to the exporters and farmers Strengthen the export sector Developing the export sector will drive foreign reserve earnings and will create a steady demand for pulses, thereby acting as a catalyst for the sector. Exporters should be supported through abusiness environment more conducive to investment and policies aimed at bolstering exporters'scale, knowledge base, as well as business development. However, realizing the potential of thepulse value chain cannot be done in isolation; it can only work if other components of theagriculture system are in place: extension, improved seed, and soil fertility measures. In the end, growing pulses should be lucrative to farmers and competitive to growing other crops at farming system level. The additional advantages that growing pulses bring (short growingseason, erosion control, soil improvement/nitrogen fixing) should be actively promoted to farmersto enhance uptake.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 102VI. Country status reports 103103Soe Lin1 and Kyaw Swar Win2 1 Senior Research Assistant, Sebin Research Farm 2 Assistant Research Officer, Department of Agricultural Research, Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation Introduction In dry areas, pulse crops play an important role in food, feed and farming systems. A vast majority of people in the dry areas of the world are dependent on pulses for their nutritional requirementsand food security. The residues of pulses are valuable animal feed and these legumes when grownin rotation with cereals provide sustainable cropping systems. The productivity of pulses indeveloping countries remains stagnant and per capita availability is far below of the WHOrecommended 45 g/person/day. Improvement in the production of these crops throughgermplasm enhancement and crop management will, therefore, contribute substantially toimproved human nutrition in the developing world. Moreover, consumption of nutritionally enhanced pulses will provide health security to the poorer section of society who cannot afford high-priced animal protein. Pulses are the second important crop in Myanmar after rice and other cereals. They are grown on 4 ,534,000 hectares (21.2 percent of sown area under various crops) with an annual production of 5,974,363 tonnes (Myanmar Agriculture at a Galance, DAP MOAI, 2014). Myanmar accounts for 4.7 percent of the world area and 5.8 percent of the world production of pulses (FAOSTAT, 2010). Pulses are grown throughout Myanmar but 92.0 percent of total pulses growing in the country are concentrated in Ayeyarwaddy, Magwe, Pegu, Mandalay, Sagaing and Yangon regions. The major pulse crops of the country are mungbeans, blackgrams, pigeon peas, chickpeas, soybeans, butterbeans, kidney beans, cowpeas, lab lab beans, sultani sultapya. More popular among these aremungbeans, soybeans cowpeas. In general, grown in two seasons: season (May-July), and (ii) post-monsoon season(October-December). Mungbeans, pigeon peas and soybeans are grown in the monsoon season, while blackgrams, chickpeas, cowpeas are grown during post-monsoon season. And also mungbeans are grown in post-monsoon season after the harvest of rice in the lower part of Myanmar. Pulses are consumed almost daily in most area of Myanmar, especially in dry-zone regions. Pulses are also becoming an important export crop and Myanmar exported 339 ,900 tonnes of mungbeans, 644 ,400 tonnes of blackgrams and 316 ,800 tonnes of other pulse crops (Myanmar Agriculture at a Galance, DAP MOAI, 2014). During 2012-2013, Myanmar exported over 1.9 million tonnes (mt) of beans and pulses, with India as the major export destination followed by the United Arab Emirates, Thailand, Bangladesh andJapan. India is the largest consumer of beans and pulses in the world and is currently Myanmar'sRecent achievement in research and development of pulses in MyanmarProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 104largest export market. India's growing population coupled with the thrust on increasing cereal and oilseed production and consumption has resulted in the country producing beans and pulses in quantities regularly falling short of meeting the domestic demand. Thus, India has to importapproximately 3-4 mt of beans and pulses annually, and this number can be exceeded if domesticproduction suffers owing to unfavourable seasonal conditions. India purchases beans and pulseson an as-needed basis, commensurate with their demand. Leveraging its almost monopoly role inMyanmar's export trade of pulses, India is able to highly influence the commodity price as thecountry is heavily dependent on India's decisions to import (Aye, P .S., Htun, H.W. and P .M. Thaw,2013). Although India is both the largest producer and consumer of pulses in the world, it relies on imports of significant amounts of pulses to close the gap between domestic production andsurging demand for consumption of pulses. During 2009-2010, India imported 3.5 mt of pulsesfrom Australia, Canada, and Myanmar. Thus, India is the largest importer, producer and consumerof pulses. On the other hand, India is also the largest pulse processor, as pulse exporting countrieslike Myanmar, Canada and Australia do not have adequate pulse processing facilities (Gowda,C.L.L., Srinivasan, S., Gaur, P .M., and K.B. Saxena, 2013). Area, production and yields of pulses in Myanmar Myanmar ranks fifth in global production of pulses. As stated above, the country contributes4.7 percent of the world area and 5.8 percent of the world production of pulses (FAOSTAT, 2010).The status of pulse production in Myanmar is shown in Table 1. Among the pulse crops,mungbeans dominates with over 28 percent of total pulse production followed by blackgrams(24.3 percent), pigeonpeas (14.0 percent), chickpeas (8.4 percent), soybeans (3.4 percent), cowpeas(6.0 percent) and other legumes (16.0 percent) (Table 2). Mungbeans cover about 1 260 361 ha, mainly grown in Magway Region (24.0 percent), Sagaing Region (16.2 percent), Bago Region (16.7 percent), Mandalay Region (11.6 percent) andAyeyarwaddy Region (5.7 percent) with an average yield of 1.11 tonne/ha and total production of1 402 892 tonnes. Blackgram is grown on 1 102 500 ha with a total production of 1 549 293 tonnesTable 1.

Its major production areas are located in Bago Region (44.0 percent), Ayeyarwaddy Region (41.0 percent), Sagaing Region (7.0 percent, Mandalay Region(2.9 percent) and Yangon Region (1.8 percent). Pigeonpeas are mainly grown in Sagaing Region (35.0 percent), Magway Region (28.0 percent), Mandalay Region (29.0 percent) and Shan State (4.0 percent). The total area under the crop is about638 ,965 ha with total production of 833 ,482 tonnes and average yield of about 1.3 tonnes/ha. Chickpeas are currently grown in 384 ,372 ha with a total production of 586 ,526 tonnes and the average yield of 1.53 tonnes/ha. The majority of this area is concentrated in the central dry zonewhich includes Sagaing (46.0 percent), Mandalay (26.0 percent) of the total chickpea production. Soybeans ( Glycine max L.), locally known as peboke , are currently grown on 155 ,181 ha with a total production of 231 ,252 tonnes and an average yield of 1.49 tonnes/ha. The majority of soybean growing areas are located in highlands of Shan St ate in rainy season and in delta area of lower Myanmar following the recession of floodwater. Cowpeas are mainly grown in the regions ofMagway and Bago with an average yield of 1.25 tonnes/ha with total production is 349 ,795 tonnes from cropped area of about 279 ,916 ha. Production and productivity of pulses has registered an upward trend from 2005-2006 to 2013-2014 (Table 3). The slight improvements are probably driven partly by the promotion of export markets and favourable prices in the local market and partly by the research anddevelopment efforts.Table 2.

In mungbeans and the biotic stresses. Pod borer ( Helicoverpa armigera ) infestation occurs every year throughout the growing season. Root diseases including collar rot ( at either dry root rot ( Rhizoctonia bataticola ) at late growth stage are serious constraints in chickpea production in Myanmar. Similarly, pod borer, maruca,fusarium wilt, and sterility mosaic diseases are affecting pigeonpea production. Bean fly, hairycaterpillar, armyworm, green bugs and rust, downy mildew and bacterial pustules diseases aremajor pests and diseases in soybean production. Among the pulses, mungbeans and pigeonpeas are grown under rainfed conditions in the central dry zone. Blackgrams, mungbeans, chickpeas, other peas and beans are grown after harvesting riceusing residual soil moisture. Drought and high temperatures are major stresses in pulse productionin Myanmar. Frequent heavy rain, off-season heavy rain and prolonged rains at some stages in thecrop life cause heavy losses to pulse crops. Socio-economic constraints In Myanmar, emphasis on rice and maize cultivation has reduced the status of pulses in farmers'cropping systems to secondary crops or catch crops. Therefore, the use of inputs is limited becausefarmers give first priority to staple cereals. In addition, there is a lack of policy support andpost-harvest innovations related to pulse crops. Availability of quality seed of improved varietiesand other inputs is one of the major constraints in increasing the production of grain legumes. Strategies to improve pulse productivity and production There are a number of technological options available for increasing the productivity andproduction of pulses. These are use of short-duration and high-yielding varieties with resistanceto diseases and pest, improved varieties with drought tolerance, adoption of good culturalpractices (pest and diseases management, weed control methods) and introduction of newadapted crop varieties, new cropping patterns for fallow land area and supplies of quality seed andimproved varieties for farmers. Moreover, on-farm research and development programmes canenhance participation of farmers and secure their cooperation in improving pulse productivity andproduction. Varietal improvement and recommended varieties of major pulse crops in Myanmar Developing new varieties which are better than the existing best ones in respect to yield or anyother desirable traits has been the foremost objective of breeding programmes. A criticalexamination of current varietal improvement programmes has shown some improvement in yieldover the local varieties and the yields are rather unstable. Productivity of pulses is severelyconstrained by various biotic and abiotic stresses. Among the constraints, drought is the mostimportant and causes great losses and complete crop failures. Therefore varieties with built-inresistance or tolerance to biotic (pests and diseases) and abiotic stresses (heat and moisturedeficit), must be developed in order to achieve stable yield.VI. Country status reports 107Successful research undertaken by the Department of Agricultural Research, Myanmar has led to development of new breeding lines and varieties. Mungbean Yezin-6, Yezin-11, Yezin-14 and localvarieties are widely grown and a majority of farmers prefer the recommended varieties for theirtraits to fit in the local areas. Yezin-6, moderate drought tolerant variety, is suitable for dry regionswith a considerable yield. Yezin-11 and Yezin-14, highly resistant to yellow mosaic virus disease,could be grown in mungbean growing area in which most of the released green gram varietiesare affected by yellow mosaic virus disease. Among the recommended varieties of blackgrams, mostly grown are Yezin-2, Yezin-3, Yezin-6 and local varieties. maturity. Yezin-3 Yezin-6 is a large-seeded, high-yielding variety. Yezin-3is recently modified by induced mutation using gamma radiation and released under the name\"Pale Tun\" which is large-seeded, early-maturing variety. Developing blackgram in progress. Yezin-4 is a photo-thermo insensitive varietywhich is sown in monsoon season with a substantial yield. In addition, several Yezin-4 derived linesmodified by induced mutation have been investigated. Pigeonpea varieties like Monywa Shwedinga and local varieties such as Thahtaykan are mostly sown in these areas. Monywa Shwedinga is locally well adapted and moderately tolerant todrought. However, the variety is small-seeded and holds low potential for export. DAR released five desi chickpea types (Yezin 1, Yezin 2, chickpea types (Yezin 3, Yezin 5 and Yezin 8) which have good export quality, high yield potential and wide adaptation. All released varieties, except Shwenilonegi (national breeding line),are supplied by ICRISAT. Among them, Yezin 3, Yezin 4 and Yezin 8 are early maturing varieties andYezin 6 is heat tolerant. Shwenilonegyi has attractive grains with high recovery of split grains (Thanet al. 2007). In cowpea research and development programmes, black-eyed cowpea varieties - Sinpelunphyu-2, Sinpelunphyu-3 and Sinpelunphyu-5 - have been released. Because of their characteristics of short-duration, larger seed size and higher yield compared with existing varieties, the potential forexport looks promising. And also in soybean development programmes, local varieties as well asintroduced breeding materials are also grown and selected to develop new varieties with desirabletraits. DAR released seven varieties, Yezin 1, Yezin 2, Yezin Yezin 4, Yezin 5, Yezin 6 and Yezin 11,which have high yield potential. Among them, Yezin 3 is early maturing and disseminated in ShanState. Yezin 6 and Yezin 11 are high yielding with wide adaptation, suitable for different croppingsystems and widely distributed in Northern Shan State. In addition, promising varieties, Yezin 12(KUSL 20004), Yezin 13 (SJ 4) and Yezin 14 (Srisamrong 1), which have good grain quality and highyield potential and suitable for Shan State are also under pre-release stage evaluation. Thesevarieties produced more yields than did the local variety, they were also more tolerant to soybeanrust in various areas. significant research was also conducted on agronomic trials. Intercroppingwith soybeans and upland rice was identified as better crop diversification. Conclusion The area, production and yield of pulses in Myanmar had increased from 2000 to 2014. However,a number of constraints, biotic and abiotic, remain that negatively impact on productivity of pulsesin Myanmar. Therefore, efforts need to be focused on improving productivity and production ofpulses through the use of improved varieties with resistance to diseases and pest and toleranceto other stresses, adoption of good cultural practices (pest and diseases management, weedcontrol methods) and use of quality seed. This is important not only for farmers to increase theirincome, improve their food and nutritional security, but also for the country to earn foreignexchange through boosting export.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 108References Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MOAI) . 2014.

Country status reports 109109Nirmal Gadal Senior Agronomist, District Agriculture Development Office, Makwanpur, Nepal General background Nepal has diverse climatic conditions and agro-ecological environments. Because of sharp differences in the altitude, the country possesses more than 300 agro-ecological niches makingagricultural research and development a complex process. Nepal is divided into four majoragro-climatic zones, the Terai (part of the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the south), the inner Terai,mid-hills and valleys, and high mountains (in the north). Soil texture varies from rich alluvialdeposits in the Terai to course-textured gravel in the high mountains (Pandey et al. , 1994). Grain legumes are grown across all the production environments ranging from 75 m to about 3 000 mabove sea level. But the main production areas are concentrated in the Terai, inner terai, valleys andmiddle hills of Nepal. Grain legumes are grown mainly as a rainfed crop (dependent on residual soil moisture) both in the terai and in the hills. Winter legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, and grasspeas are grown mainlyin the rice-based system of the terai and inner terai. Warm season grain legumes such as soybeans,blackgrams, pigeon peas and horse grams which are produced in the maize-based system of thehills. In the higher mountainous regions, peas and phaseolus beans are the two most importantsummer legumes. Winter grain legume crops are grown dependent on residual soil moisture afterthe harvest of rice or seed broadcasted on standing rice about 7-15 days prior to rice harvest (relaycropping). Warm season grain legumes are grown during summer months (monsoon rain) in mono,mixed with maize/finger-millet or on paddy bund. Area, production and productivity of pulses in Nepal In Nepal, several types and species of pulses are grown. Lentils, blackgrams, soybeans, pigeonpeas,grasspeas, grown legumes crops in the country. Grain legumes occupy 334 ,323 ha agricultural land and produce a total of 319 ,770 tonnes (Table 1). In terms of area and production, pulses rank fourth after rice ( Oryza sativa legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, and grasspeas account for about 68 percent and warm season grainlegumes such as soybeans, blackgrams, pigeonpeas and horse grams about 22 percent of the totalarea under legume crops. Phaseolus beans, mungbeans, cowpeas, rice beans, faba beans and field peas occupy only 10 percent. In the last twelve years, area under pulse crops has increased only by about 9 percent. Production of pulses increased from 243 243 tonnes in 2000 to 356 743 tonnes in 2012. Percentage incrementis by about 47 percent. This increase is mainly by augmentation of yield rather than through areaexpansion. Pulse productivity has increased by about 35 percent in 2012 in comparison with thebase-year data.Current status of pulses research and development in NepalProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 110Research on pulse crops Production gains in pulses are achieved through the development and deployment of improved varieties and production technologies. The National Grain Legume Research Program (NGRP) underthe Nepal Agriculture Research Council (NARC) is mainly responsible for conducting research inpulse crops. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are also involved in grain legume R&Dactivities in Nepal. R&D activities of both public and civil society organizations are mainlyconcentrated on germplasm collection, exchange and varietal development and validation of cropmanagement technologies in ternational organizations (ICARDA, ICRISAT, AVRDC, ACIAR/CLIMA, IITA, BARI), the Department of Agriculture (DoA), NGOs, community-basedorganizations (CBOs) and seed companies. After confirmation of the agronomical and geneticssuperiority of the germplasm, the National Seed Board (NSB) releases the variety for commercialproduction. Usually source seed (breeder and foundations seeds) is produced by NARC researchstations. Once the variety is released, the DoA is responsible to support CBOs, NGOs and privateseed companies for seed multiplication.Table 1.

Country (iron, zinc, and selenium-rich cultivars) lentil cultivars have been identified and are being tested for release. Similarly, several genotypes of major pulses crops have been identifiedfor tolerance to stemphylium blight and wilt-root rot complex diseases. Other promising technologies generated include application of botanical pesticides to control stored grain pests,weed management using herbicides, optimum sowing times, seed priming and seed rate for soleand mixed crops. Pulses promotion and its impact The DoA is mainly responsible for technology transfer activities of grain legumes. In recent years,NGOs are also heavily engaged in the dissemination of improved varieties and technologies at thefarmers' level. Research stations are also conducting on-farm validation and dissemination activitieson a limited scale. The improved technologies are disseminated through distribution of minikits,large plot demonstrations, training, field visits and community seed increase. Lentils are the main pulse crop in Nepal (62 percent area and 64 percent production of the total legumes (MOAD 2013). It is recognized as one of the major agricultural produce among 12 goodswith high export potential and medium socio-economic impacts by the Nepal Trade IntegrationStrategy (NTIS). Though limited work on formal surveys for assessment of project impacts have been done in grain legumes, information collected through formal/informal channels, official records, farm visits,district reports, farmers interaction, NARDIF project/IFAD project completion reports, indicateimproved pulse technologies have made considerable impact on crop diversification, cash incomegeneration and increase in dietary intake thus improving the living standards of farmers (Gharti,2014).Table 3.

For winter cultivation of food legumes, ten lentil and seven chickpea varieties havebeen recommended. Among the summer legumes, seven varieties of soybean, two varieties ofpigeonpea, six varieties of cowpea, three varieties each of mungbean and pea, six varieties ofgroundnut, two varieties of common beans and one variety of blackgram have been released forgeneral cultivation (Table 3).Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 112Input delivery systems Inputs such as fertilizer, seeds, tools, pesticides, etc. are marketed through government-owned companies (Agricultural Input Company and National Seed Company), private enterprises andagro-vets (local input retailers). However, in pulses, external inputs are rarely used and these aregrown under residual nutrients and water. Constraints The low level of funding for grain legume research is the main bottleneck hindering increasedproduction and productivity in the country. This is mainly due to the fact that until now Nepal'sR&D priorities have focused on assuring food supply for the increasing population. The wide gapbetween the attainable yields and those on farmers' fields are due to various biotic, abiotic andsocio-economic factors. The major diseases are wilt root rot, Stemphylium blight in lentils, andmungbeans, yellow mosaic virus in blackgrams, soybeans and mungbeans, white mold in rajmaand Botrytis gray mold in chickpeas. Helicoverva pod borer is the major production constraint in chickpea production. In storage, bruchids can cause severe losses. The major abiotic factorsaffecting winter crop production are soil moistur e deficits (drought and high temperature during pod filling stage), micronutrient disorders (nutrient deficiency boron). Low adoption of improvedpackages of practices, inadequate extension services and promotional activities, lack of systematicseed production mechanisms, non-availability of inputs on time (seeds, fertilizers etc.), unavailabilityof suitable varieties for varied agro-ecological domains and technologies for all grain legumescrops, yield instability over years, high losses in storage, and other socio-economic constraints(Shrestha et al., 2011). Opportunities for grain legume research and development in Nepal Grain legumes play an important role in Nepalese agriculture contributing towards food and nutritional security, nitrogen economy, crop intensification, diversification and sustainable farmingsystems (Gharti et al. , 2014). Pulses possess tremendous potential for alleviating poverty and malnutrition especially of subsistence producers and vegetarian consumers in Nepal. Seed isa good source of protein (18-22 percent), carbohydrate (52-70 percent), fat (4-10 percent),minerals (calcium, phosphorus, iron) and vitamins. For a majority of the poor who cannot afford expensive animal protein, legumes can be important basis for their nutrition security. Most of the pulses have diverse utilization in the Nepalese diet.They are consumed as whole seed (boiled, roasted, parched, fried, steamed, and sprouted); dal (soup) or as flour. Tender leaves and twigs are used as green vegetable in various communities.Green pods of beans, peas and beans are used as green vegetables. Pulse seeds are usuallydigestible among other crops and most of the recipes prepared from pulses are widely used asin healthy diets. In spite of the fact that grain legumes are essential components of the Nepalesediet, their consumption is only 9 kg per capita per annum which is four times less than thatrecommended by FAO (Shrestha et al., 2011). This shows the clear opportunity to expand area and increase productivity of pulse crops to meet the domestic demand of the country. Legumes arealso grown for improving soil conditions. Green foliage can be used as green manure. Cropresidues and by-products are also valuable as fodder, feed and firewood. On the economic side, Nepalese farmers grow legumes for home consumption and marketing as well. In the mountains and hills, legumes are grown primarily for home consumption, while in thetarai and warmer valleys of the hills they are grown both for home consumption and for themarket.VI. Country status reports 113Large quantities of pulses are imported from India and other countries as domestic production falls short of meeting the growing demand. In 2009, pulses (excluding soybeans) export and importwere valued at US$ 75 ,459,000 and US$ 29 ,184,000, respectively (FAO 2011). Data on export quantities and values show very promising context for increasing pulse production and export. In 2005, Nepal exported 14 ,591 tonnes of pulses (mainly lentils) and earned US$ 7 ,273 and in 2011 the export quantity and values increased to 22 ,533 tonnes and US 24 ,287. Therefore, legumes can be extremely important for import substitution and export promotion inagriculture. Source: TEPC (2011) Figure 1.

The diverse climate and environmental conditions of Nepal offer opportunities to growmany species of food legumes and these crops fit well in the Nepalese cropping systems prevailingin most of the agro-ecological zones and can be grown in various seasons (winter, spring andsummer seasons). The cultivation of lentils is increasing because of the increasing preference for its internal consumption and potential for export. Nepalese lentils have great demand in the internationalmarket. Bangladesh, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Germany, Republic of Korea, UK, Indonesia are majorexport markets. Soybeans are identified as an industrial crop and important ingredient for thepoultry industry. Pulses can be promoted to adapt agriculture to climate change. Legumes usually can withstand moisture stress and they can be grown well in the areas with drier climate and low soil fertility.These crops can be grown in wasteland, terraces, bund and in agro-forestry systems. It has gotmultiple uses as food, fuel, fodder, soil fertility improvement and reduction of soil degradation inslopey land. Several species of legumes are short duration (60-70 days) crops which can beproduced on residual soil moisture after rice, wheat and maize. Rice beans are one of the neglectedand under-utilized summer grain legumes cultivated mainly in the hilly areas of the country asa mixed crop with maize with no additional inputs and care.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 114Lessons learned and recommendations 1. The Government of Nepal (GoN) should c onsider pulses as strategic high priority crop to realize the multiple benefits of pulses for food and nutrition security; environmentalconservation; import substitution and export promotion. For this GoN should declarea 'pulses mission programme' in partnership with the CG centers and private entrepreneurs. 2. The National Pulses Breeding Programme should be strengthened by improving infrastructures and human resource capacity. Seed multiplication should be increasedthrough community-based seed production and active participation of private seedcompanies. 3. Breeding should focus on developing varieties for higher yields, early maturity, pest and terminal drought and heat stress tolerance. Likewise, agronomic research should focus onIPM for the management of major pest and diseases of grain legumes and on cost-effectivetechnologies such as conservation agriculture and small-scale mechanizations. 4. Breeding research should focus on screening and development of climate resilient varieties. 5. Studies should be undertaken to develop value chains for major pulses including soybeans. Conclusion Grain legumes have high potentiality to alleviate poverty and malnutrition of resource poorfarmers. There are also opportunities for import substitution and export promotion by increasingarea and productivity. However, the Government of Nepal still has not given due priority to grainlegume research and development works. Pulses are considered secondary crops and almost noexternal inputs and agronomic practices are applied by farmers. Commercialization of high valuelegumes such as lentils, mungbeans, rajma (kidney beans) and peas can be achieved throughcoordinated efforts of public, private and farmers' cooperatives. In the initial stage, GoN may needto provide incentives to pulse producers, processors and traders to motivate them to engage intheir businesses in a professional way. Access of farmers to quality seeds, fertilizers, irrigation,improved post-harvest management and marketing can be vital for increasing production andproductivity. Research to address the problems faced by value chain actors (farmers, traders, processors, exporters, consumers, input suppliers etc.) of the pulse subsector is equally important to promotecommercial farming of grain legumes. Considering the diverse agro-climatic conditions andcropping systems prevalent in the country, we see tremendous scope to enhance pulse productionin south Asia.VI.

Country status reports 117117Sartaj Khan1 and Muhammad Tahir Coordinator (Sugar and Food Legumes), PARC, Islamabad 2Director-General, Ministry of National Food Security and Research, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad, Pakistan Abstract Four major pulse crops - chickpeas commonly grown in Pakistan. Among these, chickpeas are the major winter food legume and mungbeans are the major summer legume.Chickpeas occupy 76 percent of the total pulses area with 73 percent contribution to the totalproduction and mungbeans occupy 12 percent of total pulses area contributing 14 percent tothe total pulses production. More than 80 percent of pulses are grown in Punjab and the restof the area is spread in other provinces. Pulses are considered secondary to cereal crops andrelegated to marginal soils as they are perceived to be low-yielding and less remunerativecrops. As a result, the growth rate of production of pulses is lower than that of cereal crops.Per capita availability of pulses decreased from 8.11 kg/annum in 2005/06 to 4.64 kg/annumin 2012/13. The improvement in production of pulses was not enough and large quantities areimported to meet the ever increasing gap between the domestic production and requirements. Production of pulses can be increased by adopting high-yielding varieties and production technology developed through coordinated research. The major output of the coordinatedeffort was the release of 27 varieties of chickpea, 11 of lentil, 15 of mungbean and 7 ofmashbean for commercial cultivation. Development of chickpea varieties resistant to blight(Ascochyta rabiei ) and release of short duration mung and mash bean varieties coupled with matching agro-technologies brought expansion in new niches and diversification in theexisting cropping systems. There is great potential in central Punjab and Sindh to intercropmungbeans with sugarcane. Similarly, short duration varieties of mungbeans can besuccessfully grown as catch crop in a rice-wheat cropping system to expand the area ofcultivation and improve soil fertility. Development of high-yielding, early maturing and diseaseresistant genotypes along with a viable seed production and dissemination system will playmajor roles in pulse crop production in the future. Introduction Consumption of protein is essential to maintain the health and vigour of the people and pulsesare the most important source of protein in Pakistan. They contain about 20-25 percent proteinand can help in providing the essential nitrogenous constituents of the human food. The supplyof meat is not keeping pace with the population growth and, therefore, the production of pulsesshould be increased. The agro-ecological conditions prevailing in the country are highly congenialStatus of pulses in PakistanProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 118for growing all different kinds of pulses. However, pulse production in the country is stagnant and is likely to disturb nutritional balance of the population especially of poor and weaker sectionswhich cannot afford other expensive sources of proteins. The major supply of food legumesdepends upon the production of chickpeas and mungbeans. Failure of these crops results ina pulse debacle in the country. One of the main reasons for stagnation in production of pulses inthe country is inadequate investment resulting in non-adoption of the full package of improvedproduction technology by the farmers. Pulses are grown under rainfed conditions on poor soilswith low inputs, while higher productivity can be achieved through the use of improved varieties,bio-fertilizers and micronutrients. In irrigated ar eas, pulses cannot compete with cash crops and hence the area under pulses remained static with little change. This phenomenon occurred in Sialkot area where cultivation of blackgrams and lentils has almost disappeared because of the installation of tubewells and farmers shifting to cash crops due towater availability. There is an urgent need to increase pulse production in the country to cope withthe requirements. This is possible by either area expansion or realizing yield potential, while thescope of former is limited and an increase in area under pulses crops is only possible byincorporating pulse crops in rice-wheat cropping systems and in sugarcane fields. The latter canbe achieved if a serious thought is given to the adoption of the full package of available improvedproduction technologies. Unfortunately, farmers in rainfed areas are yet to adopt the practice ofusing high-input technology and this merits attention from policy makers as most farmers inrainfed areas are resource-deficient. Trends in pulse area, production and productivity The total area and production of pulse crops from 2007-2008 to 2013-2014 in Pakistan is presentedin Table 1. Among these, chickpeas are the major winter food legume and mungbeans are themajor summer legume. Chickpeas occupy 76 percent of the total pulse area with 73 percentcontribution to the total production, whereas mungbeans occupy 12 percent of total pulse area Table 1.

Mash and lentils each are cultivated on around 2-5 percent of the total pulse area and each of them contributes 2-5 percent to the total pulseproduction. More than 80 percent of pulses are grown in Punjab and the rest of the area is spreadin an other three provinces. Chickpeas are the major winter food legume grown on 73 percent of the total pulse area with 76 percent contribution to the total production (GOP 2012-2013). Two types of chickpeas aregrown: Desi, which is thought to have originated first and produces small, brown-coloured seeds and Kabuli, which produces a larger, cream-coloured seed. Almost all the countries with high chickpea yields are producers of Kabuli and yet it is often more prone to climatic and disease stresses. But in Pakistan, Kabuli chickpeas occupy a small proportion of total chickpea cultivated area. Therefore, most of the chickpea production comes from Desi type. Chickpeas are well known for their ability to withstand moisture stress. The major supply of grain legumes depends upon theproduction of chickpeas and failure of this crop results in shortage of pulses in the country. The area of chickpeas in the country remained stagnant with little fluctuation. However, the production profile revealed severe fluctuation highlighting the problem of instability (Figure 1). As>80 percent of the area of chickpea is grown as rainfed, the crop is highly sensitive to changes inweather conditions. Figure 1. Trend in area, production and yield of chickpea Lentils are the second major winter season pulse crop after chickpeas in Pakistan. Lentils representonly 5 percent of the total pulse production (GOP 2012-2013). During the last 65 years, the annuallentil production in the country remained around 30 thousand tonnes, which is stagnant andmeets almost half of the total demand (Figure 2). The total area has decreased by 33 percentduring this time. The achievement of the same total production from less area may be attributedto the use of relatively better varieties and crop management practices by farmers.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 120Mungbeans are also grown during the spring season mainly in southern Punjab and Sindh province. Punjab is the major mungbean growing province that alone accounted for 88 percentin area and 85 percent of the total mungbean production in the country. It is also grown indifferent crop rotations; about 75 percent of cultivation follows mungbean-wheat crop rotation.The breeding improvement of mungbeans had been limited until 1970 due to the selection fromland races which were of trailing types. Since the 1980s, research on this crop gained momentumas in other pulses. About ten improved varieties have been released for general cultivation in thecountry since 1985/86. With the development of short-duration and uniformly maturing varieties,mungbeans can be fitted in various cropping systems. Trends in the annual production of mungbeans for the last 65 years are shown in Figure 3. Among the major constraints weeds, insectdamage and lack of seed production are the most important ones. Research activities onmungbeans have been mainly focused on the development of high-yielding varieties with wideradaptability, resistance to diseases, such as mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) and Cercospora leaf spot (CLS), early maturity and insensitivity to photo period.Figure 2.

In the system, chickpeas are crop and mungbeans as irrigated. Chickpeas arebeing mono cropped in the Thal desert. It is a drought tolerant cash crop and thus is the majorwealth for the people of Thal. The cost-benefit ratio of 1: 2.5 suggests that even in the presentcircumstances chickpea production is beneficial in this desert area. Adopting improved technologyin chickpea production would further increase returns at the farm level (Nisar et al. , 2007). The cereal-cereal crop rotations are predominant in most of the irrigated areas of Pakistan since decades. This situation warrants restructuring of chickpea production systems placing moreemphasis on its vertical growth with the use of irrigation and better inputs besides introductionof input responsive short-duration varieties. This will enable fitting chickpeas in the croppingsystems of irrigated areas so as to compete with other cash crops. This will also help diversify thecropping systems of irrigated areas with inclusion of legumes. Kabuli chickpeas have potential to grow in irrigated areas. Economic analysis of chickpea production in the rainfed area of Thal ispresented in Table 2.Mash or backgrams occupy an important position in Pakistan's agriculture. They grow on marginal land where other crops perform poorly. Yield of mash is very low because mostly indigenous landraces are cultivated and also because the crop is often grown on marginally fertile land withinsufficient water. Trend in area, production and yield of mash are given in Figure 4. In Pakistan,mash is the least researched crop among pulses despite its high nutritive and economic value andas a result its area and production decreased continuously. The lack of suitable and high-yieldingvarieties and basic information about production technology are major inhibiting factors. Therefore,research on mash improvement should be focused on development of high-yielding varieties withresistance to diseases, particularly MYMV and CLS. Figure 4. Trend in area, production and yield of mashbeansProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 122Although mungbeans are grown in different crop rotations, about 75 percent of cultivation follows mungbean-wheat crop rotation. With the development of short-duration and uniform maturingvarieties, mungbeans can be fitted in various cropping systems. There is great potential in centralPunjab and Sindh to intercrop mungbeans with sugarcane. Similarly, short duration varieties ofmungbeans can be introduced as a catch crop in rice-wheat cropping systems to expand the areaof cultivation and improve soil fertility. A large area of 0.5 mha (million hectares) in the mediumto high rainfall region of Potohar remains fallow after wheat where mungbeans can be grown aspart of double cropping in wheat-fallow areas to increase overall production in the country. Thisarea is double the current area under cultivation of mungbeans in the country which indicates itshigh potential for increasing total production. Studies suggested that wheat growth anddevelopment and yield formation differ significantly when followed after mungbeans as comparedwith fallow. Net monetary benefits of Rs.5 820 per hectare could be obtained by sowingmungbeans in wheat-based cropping system (Asim et al., 2006). Preliminary comparative economics of various cropping patterns in Punjab is presented in Table 3. It showed that thecropping pattern involving pulses provide more economic benefit to farmers. The total area under lentils decreased by 33 percent, the Potohar region contributes more than 35 percent of the total production of the country. The area of lentils can be expanded byintercropping the crop in September-sown sugarcane. The total area under sugarcane isapproximately 1 million hectares out of which one-fourth is autumn planted. This autumn plantedsugarcane has great potential for intercropping of lentils and Kabuli chickpeas. This crop not onlyincreases the output per unit area but also can provide mid-season income which eases theburden on the already depleted income of the farmers and can provide them with an option forbetter input management for the remaining sugarcane growing season. Production of lentils canbe increased from 0.4 tonne/ha to 1.5 tonnes/ha with the adoption of improved varieties andmanagement practices.

Country status reports 123In view of the potential role of legumes in contributing to cropping system sustainability in the country through their ameliorative effects on soil health (in terms of additions of fixed N and soilorganic matter) without having to sacrifice major crops like wheat and rice, strong efforts areneeded to introduce legumes where soil organic matter is generally declining and more rationalN cycling is needed. Availability of short-duration mung and mash varieties coupled with matchingagro-technologies has tremendous potential for expansion in new niches and diversification in theexisting cropping systems as shown in Table 5.Table 3.

The wide gap between the attainableyield potentials and farmers' yield is due to various biotic, abiotic and socio-economic factors. Bioticfactors are diseases, insects and weeds. The major diseases and pests of pulse crops are presentedin Table 6. The weeds are another serious constraint to increased production. Pulses are generallypoor competitors to weeds because of slow growth rates and limited leaf area development atearly stages of crop growth and establishment. In storage, bruchids can cause severe losses.Table 5. Possible new niches for pulses Cropping Pattern Possible nichesSuitable varieties of pulse crops Rice Table 6.

Country status reports 125The major abiotic factors affecting winter crop production are cold stress at flowering stage, soil moisture deficits (drought and high temperature during pod filling stage) and micronutrientdisorders. In Kharif crops temperature stress and terminal drought are major abiotic factors. Socio-economic constraints include low adoption of impr oved packages of practices, inadequate extension services and promotional activities, lack of systematic seed production mechanisms,non-availability of inputs on time (seeds, fertilizers etc.), unavailability of suitable varieties for variedagro-ecological domains, yield instability over years and high losses in storage. Post-emergencechemical weed control and no mechanization for combine harvesting are other researchablefactors. Trends in production and consumption Domestic production of all pulse crops needs to be increased to meet the demand of the country.Chickpea production increased from 474 600 tonnes in 2007-2008 to 975 000 tonnes in 2012-2013.On the other hand for the same period, production of lentils, mungbeans and mashbeansdecreased with time (Table 1). As a result, per capita availability of pulses has decreased from 8.11kg/annum in 2005-2006 to 4.64 kg/annum in 2012-2013 (Agriculture Statistic 2012-2013).Consumption of pulses is relatively high during the summer season, Ramadan, Eid, Moharram andother local festive seasons, various pulse varieties are consumed according to regional preferences. Import and export of pulses To keep pulse prices in the domestic market stable, Pakistan imports large quantities of pulses tomeet the ever increasing gap between domestic production and requirements (Rani et al., 2014). The improvement in production was not enough to meet the increased requirement of pulses in the country. Import of pulses for the last seven years has increased (Table 7). Domestic production of pulses needs to be increased by adopting improved production technology. Table 7. Import and export of pulses Y earImport Export Qty Value Qty Value (000 tonnes) ($ million) (000 tonnes) million) 315.00 - - Agriculture Statistics of Pakistan, 2012-2013 The shortfall in the domestic production of Kabuli chickpeas, lentils and mash increased the import of these pulses. There is a considerable yield gap between the potential and national average yieldsof all pulses crops (Table 8).Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 126Projected demand of pulses The demand for pulses has been projected at 1.23 million tonnes by the year 2020 and 2.01 million tonnes by 2050 (Zubair 2011). The future demand as indicated in Table 9 will continuously growwith increased population.Table 8.

Research achievements The support of the National Coordinated Research Programme (NCRP) on pulses benefited the country in terms of germplasm acquisition, variety development, and capacity building of scientists,new technologies, and knowledge sharing and strengthening of the National Agricultural ResearchSystem (NARS). The activity has significantly contributed to monetary returns to the country.Ascochyta blight, the deadly disease of chickpeas did not appear in epidemic after 1984 due to release of resistant cultivars. Remarkable impact was noted in mungbeans wherein its areaincreased 3-4 times due to development of short duration, bold-seeded disease resistant varieties.Mungbeans were included into irrigated systems in the districts of Bhakkar, Mianwali and Layyah,where they occupy more than 80 percent of mungbean cropped area. It all happened thanks to the release of improved cultivars. Some valuables of lentils and mash were evolved but the impactwas masked by displacement of these crops from their traditional areas, resulting in a drasticdecrease in cultivated area in last two decades. Germplasm of major pulse crops acquired fromindigenous and exotic sources was evaluated and shared with provinces as shown in Table 10. Themajor output of coordinated efforts was the release of improved varieties through the NARS.Twenty-seven varieties of chickpeas, 11 of lentils, 15 of mungbeans and 7 of mashbeasn werereleased for commercial cultivation. Chickpea varieties tolerant and blight include Balkasar, and Dasht, Parbat, respectively.Table 9.

Country status reports 127Crop management Weed management through the use of post-emergence herbicides: The work to find post-emergence herbicides for pulses was started in 2004/05 in collaboration with the private sector. Eighteendifferent herbicides used over the years and the following two were found safe for mungbeans andmash only. Both weedicides showed no phyto-toxicity in mungbeans and mash. The applicationof these herbicides increased yields by 50 percent in mungbeans and mash. It is expected thatthese findings will revolutionize mungbean and mash production in the country. Research workis in progress for chickpeas and lentils. A pre-emergence application of Pendimethalin herbicidecan successfully be used to control weeds in lentils and chickpeas. Initial findings show that theherbicide with 'Haloxyfop-R-Methyl' is safe for lentils and chickpeas which is also a remarkablebreakthrough at least in controlling the narrow-leaf or grassy weeds.

With its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of$155 (current US$) in 1961, approximately half of the Republic of Korea's GDP was generated fromagriculture, and subsequently, the government established the first National EconomicDevelopment Plan for food self-sufficiency as one of the national priority (RDA, 2012). For efficientmanagement of the agricultural cooperatives (Agricultural Cooperative Bank, National AgriculturalCooperative Federation and Village level cooperatives) that were set up during late 1950s, theKorean government consolidated the two Agricultural Cooperatives and newly established theNational Agricultural Cooperative Federation (Choi, 2006) in 1961. Great efforts were made toachieve self-sufficiency through the introduction of the Green Revolution. The Korea Green Revolution was initiated by the research centre of Rural Development Administration (RDA), which was established in 1962. Agricultural technologies developed throughsustained investment in agricultural research and development between the 1960s and 1970s weredisseminated to farmers through focused extension efforts (Kim et al. , 2010). This had an impact on rice production, which had reached 100 percent self-sufficiency in the late 1970s throughexpanding the cultivation of high-yielding rice varieties, \"Tongil\" and Tongil-type, and rice becamethe staple food crop (RDA, 2012). Despite considerable progress achieved in the development of agriculture in the Republic of Korea, the development of pulse crops started off slowly as they were considered less important thanstaple crops such as rice, even though 100 percent pulse self-sufficiency was achieved back in 1965(Processing and Utilization of legumes, 2000). Pulse crops in the Republic of Korea havetraditionally been recognized as a valuable food source owing to their use in a wide array ofKorean dishes, including fermented soybean paste pancake (Nokdu 1970s, Korean farmers stated to look for otherways to make money with their produced pulse crops instead of pursuing self-sufficiency farming.However, the production of mungbean and adzuki bean started decreasing over 1971-1980because of low levels of income generated from pulses compared with other crops. In contrast, thedemand of soybean grew substantially from 1975 to 1985, resulting in a fast-track breedingprogramme for development of soybean cultivars. The modernized soybean breeding began fromas early as 1960 at the Crop Experiment Station in Suwon, but a full-scale breeding programmewas implemented in the early 1970s that accelerated cultivar development.

Area, production and yield of soybeans, adzuki beans, mungbeans, cowpeas, common beans, peas, and total pulses of the Republic of Korea from 1971 to 2013common beans and peas started slowly in the 1980s. From 1981 to 1991, field experiments were conducted for the improvement of genetic diversity among pulse cultivars and for the selectionof the right herbicide and right application dose. These efforts resulted in rapid increases inproduction of adzuki beans and mungbeans after treatment with benomyl at a concentration of1 ,000 that helped reduce the occurrence of bro wn blotch, powdery mildew, downy mildew diseases during 1986 and 1987. Considering the nutritional and health aspects, Koreans started to pay attention to pulse crops where the development of new varieties started gaining momemtum and led to increasingtheir yields. Many new pulse varieties have been developed since the early 1990s includingDanbaegkong for soybeans, Seonhwanogdu for mungbeans, Kumsil-pat for adzuki cowpeas, Hwanghyeob 1 for common beans, and Sachulwandu for peas. Keeping in perspective the increase in demand for consumption of pulses fuelled by growth of the population, estimated at 50.2 million in 2013 up from 25.0 million in 1960, research focus wasmainly directed at enhancing legume productivity to increase production as well as improve cropquality for human wellbeing. As technology advances, tremendous progress has been made inrecent years. Therefore, this report highlights the recent achievement in research and developmentof pulses in the Republic of Korea. Trends in pulse area, production and productivity The Republic of Korea is one of the important pulse producing countries in Asia. The most ediblepulses grown in the Republic of Korea are soybeans, adzuki beans, mung beans, cowpeas, commonbeans, and peas (Table 1). About 89 percent of the total pulse production in Korea comes fromsoybeans. It is grown on a range of land types from the plain lands (31 percent) to the middlemountains (43 percent), and from the mountains to the mountainous regions (26 percent).The cropped area remained fairly constant across all pulse crops from 1971 to 1989 for soybeans,1971 to 1987 for adzuki beans, 1971 to 1988 for mungbeans, and 1971 to 1987 for other pulses(Figure 1).VI. Country status reports Yield increase in soybeans from 1980s to 2000s by new varietiesThis was followed by a steadily decreasing trend that persisted till 2013. To note, mungbeans and adzuki beans gained popularity in 1981 and 1982, resulting in a short-term increase. During thelast 30 years, continuous reduction of yield and production was observed; however, extensivebreeding efforts to improve the yield led to higher production from less land depending onspecific use. For example, even though the area of soybean cultivation decreased from 188 ,431 ha in 1980 to 85 ,270 ha in 2004, the improved varieties such as Hwangkeumkong, Taekwangkong, Daewonkong, and Daepungkong for tofu and soy sauce allowed soybean yields to increase(Figure 2). In general, among the pulses, soybeans occupy the largest area, and produce the highest yield and production in the Republic of Korea. A dzuki beans rank second and mungbeans third in production of pulses in the country. The national production has been highly concentrated in theprovinces of Youngnam, Honam, and lowtemperature prevents germination for cowp eas and common beans, they are usually grown in middle and southern Republic of Korea at different planting dates depending on the regions. Incontrast, peas are generally planted in November usually in the southern part of the Republic ofKorea because of its ability to adapt well to the cold and a light freeze. Pulse-based farming systems dynamics Even before the 1980s, cereal and legume intercropping has been practiced in the Republic ofKorea as nitrogen-fixing improves soil quality that ultimately increases yields. In the past,intercropping of field crops with barley, wheat, vegetables, tobacco, medicinal crops, potatoes, andlegumes was common to increase self-sufficiency in food. As barley is the second most importantcereal crop, barley-pulse crop intercropping systems have been extensively practiced since the1970s including barley + soybean/adzuki bean (57.6 percent) and potato + soybean/adzuki bean(2.3 percent) (Table 1). The evidence of the advantages of intercropping systems led to morecombinations of crops having been developed in the 1980s, diversifying the past pulse-basedcropping systems. In the 1980s, the combinations of barley + soybean/adzuki bean accounted for40.1 percent, potato + soybean/adzuki bean 0.5 percent, tobacco - soybean/adzuki bean 13.4percent and vegetable - soybean/adzuki bean 3.7 percent of pulse-based cropping systems(Table 1).Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 134Table 1.

When soybean is planted as sole crop, the optimumtime for planting date is from early May to mid-May (Table 2); however, double-cropping soybeansand barley are planted in the latter half of June, which has been widely practiced as it reduces the incidence of disease effectively. Major achievements in increasing pulse production and productivity There has been a significant achievement in breeding that contributed to increasing pulseproduction since the 1990s. In the past, breeding successes were limited to a few productive cultivars because of a deficit in knowledge and technology (Table 3). Based on purposes, differentvarieties have been developed. Soybeans have been used in various forms in the Republic of Koreaincluding soy pastes, soybean sprouts, soybeans for cooking with rice, vegetable soybeans, and others. The most popular soybean foods are derived from soy pastes and soybean sprouts and amajority of varieties that have been developed focused particularly on those two characteristics(Table 4).VI.

About 4 ,238 ha of adzuki beans were harvested with a production of 4 ,561 tonnes and yield of 1,076 kg/ha in 2010. Self-sufficiency in adzuki beans reached 60 percent before 1990s, but dropped significantly to 18.2 percent in 2010. Mungbeans, the third important crop followed by soybeansand adzuki beans, had an average production of 4 ,200 tonnes over 1991-2000. Because of asynchronous flowering of mungbeans, production was significantly low and caused problems inharvesting. However, a new mungbean cultivar, \"Dahyeon\" , has been developed recently that has synchronous pod maturity and higher yield. Most of the cultivars for cowpeas, common beans, and peas had been developed in the early 2000s for different purposes such as seed variety, vegetable variety, and edible-pod variety (Table 7).Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 136Table 7.

Soybeans hold the largest area forcultivation; however, according to RDA, the p er capita area of cultivated land is less than 1 ha in 2005 and 0.1 ha in 2010 (Table 8), accounting for approximately 80.3 percent and 71.9 percent ofthe total soybean area, respectively, where mechanization in farming has been a constraint. Pulse crops, considered as poor-income crops, are grown mostly in the middle to high mountainous regions of the Republic of Korea because these areas are unfavourable for growingmost other crops. Serious drawbacks to mountainous farming are soil erosion, fertilizer application,and shortage of water. Usually, pulses are planted around May-June and are harvested inSeptember-October, but lack of irrigation causes the crops to be affected by drought that reducesgrain yield and subsequently results in low income. Geographically, the Republic of Korea lies in a temperate climate zone which is not an optimal area for pulse cultivation. The insufficient rain occurring in May and June retards initial growth inthe plant's life cycle including germination. However, the rainy season starts in the Republic ofKorea in mid-July which increases lodging and disease infestation. Finally, even though pulse cropshave considerable commercial value and can make a contribution to income, other crops, such ascorn, sweet potatoes, potatoes and horticulture crops are considered a better source of boostinghousehold income. Consequently, pulse cultivation faces major challenges of mechanization andirrigation. Implementation of irrigation schemes with proper drainage should be undertaken tocombat drought stress in May to June and water stress during the rainy season in July. Thegovernment should invest more resources in accelerating mechanization because it alleviatesmajor constraints on productivity and helps increase the farm income in cultivation of pulse crops.For example, labour time required for soybeans has been much higher compared with the labourtime required for rice (Table 9). In rice cultivation, the staple crop in the Republic of Korea, fastermechanization has helped reduce the labour intensity.VI. Country status reports 137Table 9.

They aim at reducing thefarming costs through the expansion of farming areas, mechanization systematization andmodernization of the facilities in the aspects of production of upland crop products includingpulse crops. The field improvement project has been launched in order to improve productivity of crops and to improve the condition of fields for production by upgrading infrastructure. Not only does theproject include the field condition, but also water irrigation systems, construction of farm road, andreadjustment of field. Until 2005, a total of $1.68 billion had been invested for improvement of69 000 ha of field. Moreover, the Korean government has promoted a project to expand farmer'sincome sources by implementing different programmes, such as expansion of exchanges betweenurban and rural areas, establishment of industrial complexes of rural areas, promotion of farmproduce processing businesses, development of green tourism villages and development oftradition in villages. The conservation agriculture of pulse crops focuses on maximizing their biological N fixation because of the utility of intercropping systems among pulses including soybeans, adzuki beans,mungbeans, cowpeas, common beans, and peas. In fact, intercropping, in general, provided higherand more stable incomes from 1997 to 2006 (Table 10). Contribution of pulses to nutrition, employment and income generation and value chain development including processing and marketing Pulses provide a range of essential nutrients that ar e high in protein and carbohydrate (Table 11). In contrast to aduzki beans and mungbeans, soybeans contribute enormously to oil productionin the Republic of Korea as edible cooking oil consisting of polyunsaturated fats, especially linoleicacid (omega-6).Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 138The contribution of labour in pulse production has been low due to urbanization and the industry movement from primary to secondary and tertiary. Currently, adzuki beans and peas are becomingvaluable economic crops and thus they have income-generating capacity (Table 12). The current model of processing and marketing of pulse crops begins from farmers who produce seeds. These are then distributed either to industry or consumer or agriculture cooperatives(Figure 3). A large amount of seeds are collected by industry such as CJ or PulMooWon, wherepulse crops are processed into paste, sauce, or other end uses. However, domestic production ofpulses in the Republic of Korea meets only 10 percent of consumer demand for pulses and theremainding 90 percent of the demand is met by imports.

Current model of pulse processing and marketingVI. Country status reports 139Even though soybean is the major pulse crop, the Republic of Korea is the one of the major importers of soybeans in Asia and its import has been steadily increasing over the years. In orderto activate the pulse crop industry, the brand management promotion programme is suggested.By fostering the brand product from CJ or PulMooWon, it is possible to reduce the distributioncosts and increase the productivity. Strategy for meeting future opportunities and challenges and reaching out to farmers and consumers The Republic of Korea government nowadays is putting great efforts into meeting the future challenges of pulses, particularly the negative impact of global warming. Through overseasagriculture, elite cultivars and good quality seeds can be developed and yield increased formeeting the challenges. More opportunities will be driven as industrial agriculture based on large-scale cultivation has become a dominant feature of farming in the Republic of Korea. Consequently,industrial companies are the ones who will be reaching out to farmers and consumers individually. Conclusion As the total demand for pulse crops increases, researchers are currently working on thedevelopment of varieties to improve food quality in the Republic of Korea. There has been muchresearch associated with identification of importan t agronomic QTLs in soybeans. Significant progress has been made by institutes and universities in molecular marker development becausethey have great potential in improving breeding efficiency. In fact, with the advent of nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) technologies, the Republic of Korea has recently released the wholegenome sequence of mungbeans and adzuki beans that will be very useful in breedingprogrammes of pulse crops. However, a combination of marketing and scientific approaches willstill be inadequate to achieving 100 percent self-sufficiency in soybeans, mungbeans, adzuki beans,cowpeas, common beans, and peas in the foreseeable future. This demands that efforts remainfocused on steady development of agricultural research and administration policies to support theproduction of pulse crops in the Republic of Korea.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 140VI. Field Crops Research & Development Institute, Mahailluppallama, Sri Lanka 2 Office of Inter-province, Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka Abstract Pulses such as mungbeans, cowpeas, soybeans and blackgrams play a prominent role in thecropping systems of dry and intermediate zones in Sri Lanka owing to their wide ecologicaladaptability. More than 85 percent of pulse crops are grown under rainfed conditions (\" maha \" season) in the dry zone which receives between 1 ,200 mm and 1 ,900 mm of rainfall annually covering two-thirds of the country. The major constraints impacting on the productivity of pulses were identified as limited use of high-yielding varieties and fertilizer, use of poor quality seed, poor adoption ofrecommended agronomic practices, poor use of inputs, high incidence of pest and diseases,high risk associated with rainfed farming and high cost of production inputs such as labour.Being the main responsible institute, the Field Crops Research and Development Institute(FCRDI) in the Department of Agriculture has developed high-yielding improved varieties andtechnologies in order to improve productivity of the pulse crops. The most importantconstraints limiting productivity were insects, pests and disease outbreaks in the field, andstorage pests. No resistant or highly tolerant varieties have been recommended and releasedagainst the very serious stored pest (bruchids) in cowpeas and viruses in mungbeans.Challenges and approaches for achieving self-sufficiency in pulse production have beendescribed. Introduction Sri Lanka is an island with a land area of 65 ,525 km2 and located between 5\u00ba 54' and and 79\u00ba 39' and 81\u00ba 53' east longitude. The island has a maximum length of about 435 kmand its maximum width is nearly 225 km. The climatic pattern of the country is determined by thegeneration of monsoonal wind patterns in the surrounding oceans. Rainfall is monsoonal,convectional and depressional and 55 percent of island rainfall comes from the monsoons. Themean annual rainfall ranges between 900 and 6 ,000 mm. The country is divided into three broad climatic zones: wet zone, dry zone and intermediate zone on the basis of the rainfall and itsdistribution. The mountains and the southwestern part of the country, known as the \"wet zone\" ,receives annual rainfall of 2 ,500 mm. Most of the southeastern, eastern, and northern parts of the country comprise the \"dry zone\" , which receives between 1 ,200 and 1 ,900 mm of rainfall annually covering two-thirds of the country. Most of the rainfall in these areas occurs from October toJanuary and during the rest of the year there is very little precipitation.Improving productivity and production of pulse crops in Sri LankaProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 142The rainfall distribution in the country shows a bi-modal pattern with two growing seasons; a relatively wet season \"Maha\" , from October to February and a comparatively dry season \"Yala\" , from March to September. More than 85 percen t of pulse crops are grown under rainfed conditions and mostly as a mono crop and mixed cropping by smallholder farmers. At the onset of monsoon rains,pulses are planted with one or two other crops, usually vegetables under a mixed cropping system. The agriculture sector of the country produces mainly rice, coconut and grains largely for domestic consumption and occasionally for export. The tea and rubber industry is mainly focused on exportrather than domestic use. Of the total agricultural land of 2.9 million ha (mha), 65 percent (1.9 mha)is cultivated with agricultural crops. Paddy occupies 26 percent of the agricultural land. Coconut,tea and rubber together account for 21 percent and 41 percent of lands are occupied by homegardens. The remainder (12 percent) is accounted for all other crops; other field crops, horticulturalcrops and other export crops (Central Bank Reports). Subsistence farming exists in ruralcommunities, where rice, yams, pulses and vegetables are grown extensively. Pulse crops grown in the country According to the literature, grain legumes can be classified into those containing low and highedible lipids. The latter is categorized as oilseeds and the former is generally harvested as driedpulses. The major pulse crops grown in the country are shown in Table 1. The oilseed legumes,groundnuts and soybeans are most widely grown as commercial crops for their oil content.Soybeans, introduced to Sri Lanka in order to provide an additional source of protein for theconsumer, are categorized as an oil crop. Lentils, mungbeans, cowpeas, soybeans and blackgrams are the pulses commonly consumed by the Sri Lankans. Although lentils are an important staple in the local diet, it is not domesticallyproduced and the entire requirement is met by sizeable commercial imports. In addition, Kollu (Macrotyloma uniflorum (Lam.) is one of the underutilized pulse crops grown in negligible land area in the dry upland cropping systems. Pulse crops are mostly grown in the dry and intermediate zones in Sri Lanka because of their wide ecological adaptability. Many of those crops are cultivated either as mono crop or in mixed cropwith cereals such as maize. In addition, these crops especially mungbeans and cowpeas arecultivated as a sandwich crop between the two seasons in paddy fields (Dharmasena et al., 1999). This helps increase farmers' incomes as well as enhance soil fertility by adding nitrogen to the soil.The choice of pulses as an important component of the cropping pattern in Sri Lanka has beenbased on nutritional and economic considerations. The low per capita protein intake in the country with a predominantly cereal-based diet necessitates the cultivation of pulses to supplement the diet with high percentage of plant protein.The average yield of pulses remains at a very low level. In Sri Lanka, pulses are cultivated mainlyin marginal lands under low fertility with minimum inputs resulting in low productivity (Table 2).Major pulse growing areas in Sri Lanka are shown in Table 3. Table 1. Important pulse crops grown in Sri Lanka Crop Scientific name Common name Mungbeans Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek) are an important pulse crop in the traditional farming systems in the dry and intermediate agro-ecological zones of Sri Lanka. Agriculturists andnutritionists have been trying to promote the crop to generate employment, improve household income, diversification of farming systems for sustainable agricultural production and reducing malnutrition among children and adults (Perera et al., 2012). Twenty percent of children under five years and 30 percent of the mothers are suffering from the protein malnutrition due to poorconsumption of animal protein in rural areas of the country. Hence pulses, especially mungbeans,could be used as cheap source of protein in the areas. They are grown in uplands as well as in lowlands as a catch crop with or without supplementary irrigation. Despite having the potential of being self-sufficient in the mungbeans, the country stillimports 33 percent of its requirement. In 2013, it produced about 14 ,130 tonnes of mungbeans with an average yield of 1.27 tonne/ha (SEPC). However, under favourable conditions availablevarieties could have a Cowpeas Cowpeas ( Vigna ungiculata L. Walp) are the second most important pulse crop grown in Sri Lanka. It has been traditionally grown in the subsistence farming system in the dry and intermediatezones. Cowpeas are grown both in maha and yala seasons, it is a hardy crop well adapted to relatively dry environment due to its tolerance to drought (Dharmasena et al., 1999). It is well-suited for intercropping with maize, millet and sorghum because of its ability to tolerate shade. Cowpeasare grown in both maha and yala season with maha accounting for 70 percent of the total production (Perera et al., 2012). The country is almost self-sufficient in cowpeas with annual production standing at 15 ,416 tonnes and an average yield of 1.32 tonnes/ha (Table 4).Table 2.

Pulse growing areas in Source: Agstat DOA, Sri Lanka Productivity of pulses over the period 2000-2013 is shown in Table 4.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 144Soybeans Soybeans ( Glycine max (L.) Merrill) are one of the most important legumes because of their nutrient content and potential for industrial processing. They can be promoted by increasing the demandfor processed food. Demand is rising with expansion of the poultry industry. Soybeans are aseasonal crop mainly grown in yala season occupying 80-90 percent of the total area under pulses. National production was 13 ,316 tonnes in 2013 with an average yield of 1.69 tonnes/ha (Table 5). Average yield of soybeans observed during the recent past was quite stable, while the extent andproduction have declined especially owing to low market prices for the product. Blackgrams Blackgrams ( Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper) are one of the important pulse crops in rainfed farming systems in the dry and intermediate zones. It can also be grown under low moisture and fertilityconditions. About 80 percent of the crop is cultivated during maha season as rainfed and the remainder is grown in yala season in paddy fields with supplementary irrigation (19). The total production of blackgrams in 2013 was about 9 ,172 tonnes with an average yield of 0.82 tonne/ha (Table 5).Table 4.

Country status reports 145Importance of pulse crops Smallholder farmers use pulses for household needs as well as for generating income by producing valuable and diverse products, such as grains, flour etc. Pulses are often fitted into underutilized niches that helps increase total food production within farming systems (5) and also to secure foodsupplies in the rural community. Pulses are superior sources of lysine, and increase the biologicalvalue of the combined protein while low lysine content is the limiting constraint in cereal-dominated diets relative to human amino acid balance. Pulses exhibit low glycemic index thusreducing the risk of obesity and diabetes (Foster-Powell et al., 2002) and are also shown to improve iron status in Mexican school children (Haas et al., 2010). Pulses help to reduce fertilizer cost by fixing nitrogen in soils providing benefits also to the subsequent crops. Yield gap between potential and average yield The pulse yields obtained by the farmers are much lower than the potential yields (Table 3). Themain reasons for the low yields are the limited use of high-yielding varieties and fertilizer, use ofpoor quality seed, poor adoption of recommended agronomic practices, poor use of inputs, highincidence of pest and diseases, high risk associated with rainfed farming and high cost of farmresources such as labour. Constraints to pulse crops production Constraints to pulse crop cultivation can be broadly categorized as biotic, abiotic and socio-economic. Pulses are mainly cultivated during maha season under rainfed conditions. Poor drainage and waterlogging during the rainy season causes heavy yield losses owing to low plantstand and high incidence of fungal diseases. Further, these crops are cultivated by resource-poor farmers with low or no use of inputs. Most significant socio-economic constraints are the use of poor quality seeds, poor crop management, poor marketing facilities and high labour wages.A considerable amount of pulses are imported at lower price. Consumer preference is more biasedtowards red lentil and yellow lentils which are imported to Sri Lanka to meet the nationalrequirement. Post-harvest handling and value addition of pulses is very poor in Sri Lanka. Morethan 90 percent of the products are being consumed directly. Cost of cultivation is much higherthan the net income. Present status of pulse crops in the country Major pulse growing areas Dry and Intermediate zones are the major pulse growing zones in Sri Lanka. Table 4 shows themain pulse growing districts in the country. Trends in pulse production The extent of cultivation of pulse crops depends mainly on the farm gate price and climaticconditions. Pulses produce marginal/low yields when grown under moisture stress and low soilfertility conditions (Perera et al., 2012). If there is favourable weather condition with good rainfall, farmers always go for paddy cultivation. The trend in cropped area under pulses and productionfor the period of 2000-2013 is shown in Figures 3 and 4. Production of all the pulses fluctuatedduring the period of 2000-2013. In general, area and production in mungbeans, cowpeas andsoybeans showed an increase in 2013. The area and production of mungbeans declined from 2004 to 2009 followed by a sharp increase in production till 2013. Yield of mungbeans increased from 0.81 tonnes/ha to 1.27 tonnes/haProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 146(Table 5). Yield increase was mainly due to gover nment intervention in increasing the production of pulse crops and use of quality seed. The farm gate price of mungbeans (Rs./kg) rose from 37.94to 158.30. The Department of Agriculture under the Ministry of Agriculture launched a strongprogramme on third season mungbean cultivation as a catch crop between the two seasons in paddy fields by using the residual moisture or one or two supplementary irrigation systems toincrease mungbean production. Cowpea production dramatically increased over the period 2005-2013. In 2013, the harvested area and production of cowpeas was 11 ,701 ha and 15 ,415 tonnes respectively with the average yield of 1.32 tonnes/ha (Table 4). As shown in Table 5, productivity of the crop increased from0.93 tonnes/ha to 1.32 tonnes/ha during the period 2000-2013. Because of its short duration,cowpeas are also cultivated as a catch crop between the two seasons in paddy fields. Trends in pulse consumption and imports The large gap between supply and demand for pulses caused increases in market prices of pulsesover the years. According to the 2009 Agstat figures , 77 percent of the local requirement is met by imports as against 23 percent by local production. The lack of an assured market is a key factorin the poor performance of the pulse crops. Unlike rice, there is no stable price for the crops.Therefore, farmers often receive low pric es during the harvest season. Erratic and uneven rainfall, poor use of inputs, marketing and government policies are the other important factors involvedin rainfed pulses. Compared to the locally produced pulses, consumption of lentils is higher due mainly to food habits of Sri Lankans (Sri Lanka Customs Reports). Though lentils are not produced in Sri Lanka, itis very popular dish among the children and adults in the country mainly consumed asa curry with coconut milk. Second consumer preference is for mungbeans followed by cowpeasand blackgrams. Pulses produced in the country are consumed in various ways. The most popular method of using pulses in the country is boiled, roasted, milled dhal and flour of mature grains. Processing of pulsesinto dhal is performed at domestic level in rural areas using mainly traditional methods. Thepattern of pulse utilization is summarized in Table 5. Mungbeans play a very important role in the food security of lower income groups of the country. Though sprouted mungbeans are a good source of foliate, which is essential to synthesize andrepair DNA for numerous body functions, it is not popular among consumers. And also its highlysine content makes it a good complementary food for rice-based diets. It has been shown thatmungbeans help substantially increase body iron content of anemic school children (AVRDC, 1997and 1998). Cowpeas are also used as a green manure crop, a nitrogen fixing crop or for soil erosion control. Researchers found that 25 percent of nitrogen requirement of maize could be cut down byincorporating vegetable cowpea residues in the soil before planting maize (Annual Reports, FCRDI). Soybeans are mainly used as textured vegetable protein (TVP) among Sri Lankans and popularized especially in the group belonging to the rural and estate sector. It is a prominent feature thatsoybean consumers in all sectors belong to the lowest income groups. Soybean flour mixed withcereals and mungbeans are used to prepare infant feed. Blackgrams are used for making differentfood items mixed with other cereals and pulses.VI. Country status reports 147Research achievements Review of past research, conclusions drawn from research over the past decades on the pulse crops are summarized below: Varietal development The Field Crops Research and Development Institute (FCRDI) in DoA is the main organizationresponsible for developing high-yielding varieties and technologies in order to improve theproductivity of pulse crops. A number of improved varieties of pulse crops have been developedusing conventional breeding techniques like selection and backcross methods. Limited availabilityof improved varieties with commercially preferred market traits (suitability for mechnicalharvesting) and management practices also leads to low productivity of the pulse crops.Productivity constraints of insects, pests and diseases in the field and storage conditions areperceived as being very important. So far no resistant/high tolerant varieties are recommendedand released for the very serious stored pest ( bruchids ) in cowpeas. The crop varieties recommended and released by the variety Releasing Committee in the Department of Agriculture (DOA) are described in Table 6. The commercial production of certifiedseeds is done by the Seed and Planting Material Divisions of the DOA for distributing among thegrowers. Table 6.

They are sown by line or broadcasting. Mungbeans, Cowpeas and soybeans are predominently sown by line while blackgrams are sown by broadcasting. Seed sowing byseeders has just started. It is reported that about 25-30 percent losses in pulses are caused byweeds. Major weeds affecting the crops are Cyperus rotundus and Cynadon ductylon .Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 148Nutrient management In general, pulses are grown on marginal lands with low management and inputs. A series of experiments conducted at FCRDI had led to recommendations of management practices for pulsecrops as shown in Table 7. Table 7.

Research done at FCRDI showed that yield could be subtantially increased bysupplementary irrigation at critical stages of the crop growth (Annual Reports, FCRDI). Table 8.

None of the recommended varieties showed resistance/high tolerance to the disease. Suitability of pulses for conservation agriculture More than one million hectares of land in the dryzone that falls under the rainfed upland category,comprising one fifth of the total land of Sri Lanka have been severely degraded due to continuouscultivation. Experiments conducted at the Field Crops Research and Development Institutereported that soil fertility depletes under continuos cultivation on uplands and addition ofinorganic fertilizer does not give substantial crop returns unless it is combined with organic matter(FCRDI, 2003). Initially pulses were inter-cropped with maize and soybeans, and blackgrams gavebetter results regardless of different maize populations. Mixed blackgrams and sorghum plantingsgave the highest return when sorghum was planted on one side and blackgram on the other sideof the same ridge (FCRDI, 2003). Further it was observed that the advantages of intercroppingmanioc with mungbeans and cowpeas was also in promising in intensive systems. Under rainfedconditions, intercropping maize with soybeans was found more profitable than mono cropping.VI. Country status reports 149It was found that short-aged varieties of blackgrams, cowpeas and mungbeans were successful, when cultivated after rice with residual moisture under well-drained and moderately well drainedconditions. It was reported that mungbeans could be broadcasted 3-4 days prior to harvesting riceor on the rice stubble after harvesting without land preparation and weedicide was applied justafter seeding. Thereafter the crop was maintained with two manual weedings under no fertilizerand irrigation (FCRDI, 2003). The system would be more profitable if row seeding with oneirrigation is practiced. Inclusion of pulses such mungbeans (<60 days)and cowpeas (65-70 days) in a rice-based system increased the productivity besides improving thesoil fertility. Researchers at FCRDI reported that 25 percent of the total N requirement could be cutdown when vegetable cowpeas are grown and incorpo rated into the soil prior to maize crop (Annual Reports, FCRDI). Conservation farming has shown advantages over existing farmingsystems. DoA lanched a strong programme to popularize pulses specially mungbeans and cowpeasin rice-based cropping systems where ample land is left fallow during the yala season as well as in between two rice crops as a sandwich crop. Initiatives for promotion of pigeonpea and chickpea cultivation In 1988, several pigeonpea lines were tested under Sri Lanka-ICRISAT-ADB pigeonpea project,for the adptabiltiy to the local conditions. Among those lines, one variety was released as Prasada (ICPL 2) for cultivation in Sri Lanka (Variety Release Committee Reports). However, pigeonpeacultivation was not a success story due to poor adaptability, less consumer preference andinadequate proccessing methods as well as high incidence of Maruca pest damage. Thousands of chickpea germplasm received from ICRISAT were screened and few were identified as promising lines. But seed size (smaller) was not acceptable by the farmers and the consumers.The whole chickpea requirement is imported. Ongoing research programmes and activities Plant breeding and crop improvement i) Hybridization and selction programmes of mungbeans, cowpeas, soybeans and blackgrams are continuing with the objective of developing high-yielding, early or late maturing,large-seeded varieties with high consumer preference which are tolerant to major diseasesand pests such as collar rot and pod borer (Table 6). ii) Germplasm evaluation trials of mungbeans, cowpeas, soybeans and blackgrams are going on to introduce new varieties and to select suitable parents for a hybridization programme. Plant protection Availability of resistant varieties against major insect pests is a big help to pulse growing farmerswho are not adopting pest control measures. Collar-rot incited by Sclerotium rolfsii is one of the most important diseases of cowpeas. It reduces crop yield over 40-50 percent. Collar-rot is a soilborne disease and S.rolfsii has been found to persist in soil or infected debris for several years. Therefore, the experiment is being conducted to identify long-term management practices for themanagement of the collar-rot pathogen. So far no bruchid resistant cowpea variety was identified. Identification of resistant/high tolerant pulse crop lines for major pests and diseases is continuing. Government intervention in enhancing pulse crop production Local production of pulses was encouraged during the period of 1970-1977 by imposing a banon imports resulting in short supply and unprecedented price increases . As a result, cropped areaProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 150and production went up. All pulses were heavily protected until 1991. More emphasis was given to crop diversification programmes with the reclamation of new lands for cultivation under a majorriver basin development project ( Mahaweli Development Project). Although agricultural extension staff tried to persuade farmers to diversify their cropping systems, they did not succeed owing tovarious constraints, mainly low market assurance. While imposing different tariffs, Sri Lanka issignatory to many regional agreements such as Indo-Lanka, Pakistan-Sri Lanka, SAPTA or BIMSTEC(Perera et al. , 2012). According to the Department of National Planning of Sri Lanka, the government places high priority on modernization of agricultural practices, improvement of productivity andcompetitiveness in marketing in both domestic and international markets, while enhancing valueaddition and product diversification (Perera et al., 2012). The government's agriculture policies aim at realizing multiple goals: (i) achieving food security of people, (ii) ensuring higher and sustainable income for farmers, (iii) ensuring remunerative pricesfor agriculture products, (iv) uninterrupted access to competitive markets, (v) farm mechanization,(vi) expanding the area under cultivation, (vii) reducing waste in storage, (viii) ensuringenvironmental conservation, (ix) introducing efficient farm management techniques and(x) expanding use of high-yielding varieties and efficient water management. The Ministry of Agriculture together with the Department of Agriculture has launched a massive national campaign to increase the productivity and production of pulses. Increased attention isgiven to making available quality pulse seed to the farmers. Future forecast and research direction According to the ten year work plan of the DoA, pulses are categorized into priority groups on thebasis of their demand (6). Mungbeans and soybeans are categorized under the first priority whilecowpeas and blackgrams are under the second priority group. Productivity improvement is themain strategy in order to enhance the contribution of pulses to the national economy because ofvirtually non-existent opportunities for horizontal expansion. This strategy is based onstrengthening research, extension, training, seed production and seed certification programmes(Table 9). Research activities for the improvement of pulses have been undertaken to achieve theobjectives as mentioned in Table 10. Table 9.

The group should work together inorder to increase production, reduce the cost of production, increase the quality of products andto have policy support for assured market prices and organized marketing channels . Strategies for increasing productivity and production of pulses could be broadly grouped into the followingcategories: Technology transfer 1) Adoption of existing improved varieties and technologies for bridging up the yield gap.2) Strengthening extension services to effectively disseminate technology package to farmers. 3) Provision of life-saving irrigation at critical growth stages.4) Expansion of potential areas under pulses. Technology development 1) Develop short-duration high yielding varieties. It aims at developing short-duration (<60 days) varieties that can escape terminal drought and fit into the third season cultivation as a catch crop between the two seasons in paddyfields. The variety should have characters of synchronized maturity that are suitable formechanical harvesting, specially mungbeans and cowpeas. 2) Develop varieties with drought tolerance. Mungbeans, cowpeas and blackgrams are mainly grown under rainfed conditions and developing drought tolerant varieties is the long-term solution to increasing productivityof pulses. 3) Develop varieties suitable for crop diversification. It calls for development of short-duration (<60 days) varieties of mungbeans and cowpeas suitable for third season cultivation (a catch crop in between two paddy crops). Thesevarieties should have a characteristics of harvesting >85% of the total harvest at the firstpick. 4) Develop varieties/technologies to improve resistance/tolerance to major pest and diseases, e.g. viruses in mungbeans; storage pest in mungbeans and cowpeas. 5) Application of micronutrients and growth hormones. Study done by Wani et al., (2012) indicated that the application of small quantities (0.5 to 2 kg/ha) of micronutrients such as boron, sulphur, zinc and magnesium has resulted in40-120 percent yield increase. Research needs to be done in local conditions to study theeffect of application of micronutrients on the pulse crops. 6) Increase value added products such as ready to eat or snack foods and introduce small-scale dhal processing machines. Support services 1) Increase availability of quality seeds and strengthen input delivery system at farmer level. Pulses are mainly grown by resource poor farmers using poor quality seeds despite availability of a considerable number of improved varieties. Private seed companies are notinterested to produce pulse seeds owing to its low profit margin. Therefore, farmer societiesshould be strengthened to produce quality seed of the improved varieties. Using qualityVI. Country status reports 153seed alone can lead to increasing the yield by 400-700 kg/ha (verbal communication with agriculture extension workers). 2) Support assured marketing price and organized marketing channels. Steps should also be taken to ensure guaranteed market prices and develop marketing channels that curtail therole of middlemen and bring growers and buyers into direct contact. Capacity building 1) It is very important to train the research staff especially in specific fields such as novel techniques in plant breeding, plant protection, preparation of value added products and use of machineries in the pulse cultivation. Conclusion Food security and protein nutrition especially for the rural population is a very important issue inSri Lanka. Pulse crops serve as a cheap vegetable protein source for people who cannot affordmore expensive animal protein. Erratic and uneven rainfall, use of poor quality seeds, poor cropmanagement, poor use of inputs, no assured market and high labour wages have been identifiedas the most significant constraints to pulse crops production. As a result, significant quantities ofpulses are imported at lower prices spending foreign exchange. Increasing pulse productivity andproduction is the team work of policy makers, planners, researchers, seed producers, extentionistsand the farmers. The group should work together in order to increase production, reduce the costof production, increase the quality of products and to have policy support for assured marketprices and organized marketing channels. In view of the diversity of constraints associated withpulse crops, more assistance from international research institutes is required support the R&Dprogramme in the future. And, also information and germplasm sharing should be givena higher priority in a regional collaborative programmes.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 154References Annual Reports (Various series), FCRDI, Department of Agriculture, Sri Lanka.

Country status reports Tha Phra, Muang, Khon Kaen 2 Chiang Mai Field Crops Research Center, Nong Harn, Sansai, Chiang Mai 3 Office of Agricultural Research and Development Region 1, Hang Dong, Chiang Mai Abstract The area under pulses in Thailand has been declining because of a lack of quality seed, unsuitable environment and competition with higher-income crops. Major pulses grown in thecountry are soybeans, mungbeans and peanuts. They are a cheap protein source for humansand animals which local farmers have realized and used as cooking seed and in producingprocessed food for a long time. Progressive plant breeding programmes contributed toincreasing average yields of pulses nationally and valuable nutrient content in seed promotedby a variety of food processing industries. However, the country continues to rely on large-scalecommercial imports of pulses to meet the rising domestic demand. Therefore, to increase pulseproduction and productivity, concerted efforts need to be focused on developing nationalstandard seed production systems, research and development on high-yielding varieties withbetter seed nutritional profiles, and enhancing the role of farmers in participatory research andtechnology development. Introduction Thailand is an agricultural country with rice, cassava and sugarcane as important economic crops.However, pulses are also important as food security crops under government policies becausethey are a cheap protein source available in rural areas. These crops also play an important rolein improving soil fertility and sustainability of cropping patterns. Major pulses grown inthe country are mungbeans, soybeans and peanuts. These crops can adapt to a wide range ofenvironments, therefore, they are grown throughout the country. However, production area and productivity of these pulses have shown a decreasing trend because of many factors, whiledemand in the country continues to rise, especially in the last five years. Recent research anddevelopment of pulses in Thailand aims to maintain the production area and increase productivityand quality. Trends in pulse area, production and productivity Cropped area planted with mungbeans, soybeans and peanuts tended to decline over time. In2010, the area under mungbeans was 136 ,640 ha which produced 98 ,000 tonnes with an average yield of 738 kg/ha. The planting area and production increased in 2011 and then declined since2012 onwards. Average yield dramatically decreased from 2011 to 2013 and then again rose tonearly the same level as in 2014 (Table 1). Mungbeans can be planted round the year in all partsRecent achievement in research and development of pulses in ThailandProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 156of the country. The main growing areas are located in the north - Phetchabun, Sukhothai, Nakhon Sawan, and Kumphaeng Phet, followed by in Lop Buri, Saraburi, Chai Nat andAng and Udon Thani.As the demand expanded, the productivity was not enough, therefore, Thailand needs to importmungbeans, for example, in the year 2011 about 24 ,313 tonnes worth US$ 13.3 million were imported. However, Thailand exports to the USA, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Singapore a variety ofmungbean processed products, such as noodles, flour, threshed mungbeans and canned sprouts.The value of annual exports over the period 2008-2013 was about US$ 14.7-40.19 million. The declining trend in area and productivity of mungbeans was due to unsuitable environment and competition with high value crops such as cassava and sugarcane. Table 1.

This was followed by a decline of both cropped area and production with only 30 ,240 ha remaining under soybeans and production hitting a low of 52,000 tonnes in 2014. Average yield fell slightly in 2011/2012, it recovered and increased to 1,713 tonnes/ha in 2013 and 1 ,738 tonnes/ha in 2014 (Table 2). Soybean cropped areas are located mainly in the north and northeastern parts of the country. Table 2.

Like mungbeans, area and productivity decreased because of competition with high-income crops,such as cassava, maize and sugarcane. Other factors such as high production costs and limitedsupply of quality seed of good varieties also played a role in this decline. Domestic productionmeets only 2.38 percent of the demand and the remaining 97.62 percent of the soybeansconsumed in the country are imported. However, Thailand exports soybeans, to Asian countries. Theoutstanding quality of our product is freedom from GMOs. In 2015, Thailand expects the demandto be 2.15 million tonnes of soybeans with 2.38 percent coming from in-country production andthe remaining 97.62 percent from imports.VI. Country status reports 157Peanuts are pulses that can grow round the year. They are grown mostly by smallholder farmers, with the average growing area of 0.16-0.48 ha throughout the country. The areas under peanutsare mostly located in the north followed by northeast, the south and central areas. Following thesame trend as observed in mungbeans and soybeans, planting area and productivity of peanutsdecreased over time. In 2009, planting area and total production were 32 ,838 ha and 51 ,586 tonnes, respectively and in 2013 they decreased to 28 ,258 ha and 45 ,920 tonnes, respectively. Average yield was 1 ,581 kg/ha from 2009 to 2012 and then increased to 1 ,619 and 1 ,625 kg/ha in 2013 and 2014 respectively because of increased availability of new varieties. Table 3.

This is in the irrigated areas. Therehas also been pulse cropping in the upland, which is mainly rainfed areas and a sole crop system. Mungbeans are grown after rice in the paddy but not on a large scale because of the risk of exposure of the crop to low temperature in winter, therefore it can be grown as late as in February. The second season is early rainy during May and July, which is in the paddy fields and before riceor other major crops. The risk of this cropping is uncertain rainfall and dry spells. This covers about10 percent of mungbean growing areas. The third is in the late rainy season in the uplands(August-September), covering 80 percent of gro wing area. This is mainly grown after harvesting maize and is rainfed. Soybean cropping systems are mostly rice-soybean covering 80 percent of growing area in dry season cropping (December-April) due to sufficient water supply (but less water is used than inthe dry season rice). The other 20 percent is grown in the uplands as a sole crop. The productionproblems are uncertain rainfall and dry spells leading to insect pest attacks. However the lattersystem benefits farmers to have soybean seed themselves for dry season production. Peanuts can also be grown in the paddy fields with or without irrigation. This needs to grow in areas with shallow groundwater levels after harvesting rice. The crop should be sown in November-December and harvested in February-April. W ith irrigation in the paddy fields, peanuts are grown in December-January and harvested in April-May. Peanuts are also grown in the uplands as a solecrop in the early rainy (April-May) and late rainy seasons (July-August). Major achievements in increasing pulse production and productivity 1.

Development of standard seed production systems for pulses to solve the problem of availability of quality seed. 6. Improvement of water supply sources on farms. 7. Introduction of crop diversity in production systems to prevent from disease and insect pest outbreaks. Constraints in productivity enhancement and emerging challenges The following are the limiting factors in production of pulses in Thailand: 1. Low yield due to inadequate supply of quality seeds of good varieties, low fertility of soil, drought, insect pests and disease, and inappropriate location-specific use of technology. 2. High production cost due to high cost of manual labour in planting, crop management and harvesting, high rate of seed used, and high costs of production inputs. 3. Low quality of products, especially for peanuts, which tend to be contaminated with aflatoxin because of improper postharvest procedures. 4. Dynamics of production area and productivity as affected by the environment, area and farm price. 5. Free trade for agricultural products, e.g., WTO, AFTA and AEC, can decrease productivity as production cost in Thailand is higher. 6. High average age of farmers (53 years), affecting supply of quality labour. 7. Climate change (uncertain rainfall pattern, high and very low air temperature), decreasing pulse productivity and harm to human health. Current efforts for improving pulse productivity 1. The government has a policy to maintain the planting area of the pulses and increase productivity. The Department of Agriculture produces and supplies foundation seeds orextension seeds to Department of Agricultural Extension or Cooperatives PromotionDepartment or farmer groups to produce registration seed for sale to farmers. 2. The government has a policy to reduce off-season rice area and instead to promote growing pulses, especially soybeans and mungbeans after the main season rice harvest. Inaddition, pulses are also promoted for crop rotation with sugarcane to break insect anddisease accumulation and to improve soil health. This is because pulses have a shortproduction period, require less water or moisture and the demand in the country is stillhigh. 3. There is a collaboration project among private and government sectors to promote soybean production in the country, i.e. machinery, soymilk industry, sugarcane factory,Department of Agriculture and Cooperatives Promotion Department. Suitability of pulse for conservation agriculture 1. Pulse is a low cost protein source for humans and animals. Different kinds of pulses are grown for a long time in specific areas such as soybeans in the north of Thailand (a wayof living crop). 2. Pulse improves soil chemical and physical properties and leaves essential nutrients in the soil for the following crops.VI. Country status reports 1593.

Provision of supplementary income for farmers. Pulse's contribution to nutrition, employment and income generation, and value chain development, including processing and marketing Soybeans, mungbeans and peanuts are widely used in food and feed processing. Soybean seed is composed of about 36 percent protein (can substitute animal protein in food), 20 percent oil(63 percent is polyunsaturated amino acids, containing lecithin of 5 percent) and 30 percentcarbohydrate. There are also vitamin A, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, C, E, K, calcium, magnesium,phosphorus, potassium, and isoflavones. Soy flour and soymilk are processed as primary products. Mungbean seed is mainly composed of protein (63 percent), carbohydrate (22 percent) and oil (1.5 percent). It also has vitamin B1, B2, iron, calcium and phosphorus, which are essential for health.Peanut seed contains oil (48 percent, oleic, linoleic and arachidic acids), protein (25 percent andcarbohydrate (21 percent). It has vitamin B1, B3, B6, B9, C, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus andpotassium. Food processing industries in the country use all three types of pulse for food, snacks, health food and feed in the country in large, medium and small-scale production and export the products.Apart from these, there are the OTOP (One Tumbon One Product) products developed ona community scale. These enterprises increase rural employment and income.

Encourage young people to realize the nutrition value of pulses. Conclusion Major pulses grown in Thailand are soybeans, mungbeans and peanuts. But the cropped area under pulses is declining because of inadequate supply of quality seed, increasing exposure tounfavourable growing environments and lack of competitive edge over other alternate crops.These constraints, however, should not get in the way of realizing the whole range of uniquebenefits to be derived from the cultivation and consumption of pulses. They are full of essentialnutrients for human and animals, in addition, they have short production periods that allowsinclusion cropping systems leading to improvement of soil properties and sustainability ofintensive agriculture. Many types of food processing industries established in the country serve as the basis for expanding the market and driving the demand for pulses which will incentivize efforts to increasethe domestic supply of pulses through both horizontal and vertical expansion (enhancingproductivity). Other measures are development of national standards in seed production systems,value added product development and strengthening research and development on pulses. Finally,farmers should be involved in the knowledge dissemination process. These processes should beapplied to enhance pulse production.VI.

Gaur International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) Patancheru, Hyderabad 502 324, India Abstract A sustainable increase in the production of pulses can be achieved in Asia by making enhanced investments and efforts in research, development and outreach activities on pulses.Further improved cultivars and production technologies need to be developed for enhancingproductivity and the opportunity to expand the area planted with pulses. Development andoutreach activities with already available improved cultivars and technologies offeropportunities for increasing both area and productivity of pulses in Asia. Additional area canbe brought under pulses by promoting their cultivation in rice-fallows and in intercropping,sequential cropping and other cropping systems. Wide yield gaps exist between the realizedand potential yield of pulses due to lack of adequate adoption of improved varieties and cropmanagement practices. Concerted efforts are needed on knowledge empowerment of farmersand extension personnel on improved varieties and production technologies and quality seedof new varieties and other needed inputs must be ensured. Policy support favouringsustainable intensification of cropping systems with pulses, crop insurance for pulses, creditand input supplies for farmers and marketing of pulses are needed to encourage farmers tocultivate pulses. Mechanization of pulses would play an important role in making pulsecultivation more profitable and attractive to farmers, particularly young farmers. Introduction Crop diversification with pulses as a component of intercrop, crop rotation or relay crop isidentified as one of the strategies to achieve sustainable enhancement in agricultural productivity.Pulses restore soil fertility through biological nitrogen fixation, by breaking pest, disease and weedcycles and by extending protective land cover. Pulses are widely adapted to a broad range ofenvironmental and cropping sequence niches which can be better exploited in an effective cropdiversification programme and which can then lead to substantive economic and environmentalbenefits. Pulses make vital contributions to the human diet by providing protein andmicronutrients and complementing cereals for amino acid profiles. The need to enhance food production to meet the demand of increasing populations in Asian countries placed higher emphasis on production of cereals compared with grain legumes.As a result, the area under legumes declined substantially in several countries, particularly inSouth Asia. There are challenges in sustaining the productivity of cropping systems in cerealmono-cropped areas and, thus, the emphasis is now increasing on bringing back pulses in thecropping systems.VII. Technical papers Research, development and outreach activities for enhancing pulse production in AsiaProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 164There has been substantial progress in the development of improved cultivars of pulses in recent years. These cultivars have higher yield potential, greater tolerance to insect-pests and diseases andbetter grain quality. There are success stories of substantially enhancing area and productivity ofgrain legumes in some countries/regions (e.g. chickpeas in Myanmar and Southern India). Cultivarsare now available which are more resilient to the impacts of climate change and provide greaterpotential of expanding the area of legumes in new niches and cropping systems. Anotherlandmark achievement in pulse improvement is the development of commercial hybrids inpigeonpeas that give 25 to 40 percent higher yields than the open pollinated varieties. Theadvances in genomics of pulses have been remarkable and breeders can now have enhancedprecision and efficiency of breeding programmes by integrating genomic approaches. There is still much to be done in developing further improved cultivars and production technologies and enhancing adoption of available improved cultivars and production technologies.This article describes potential areas of research, development and outreach activities that can leadto sustainable increases in pulse production. Development of further improved cultivars and production technologies Restructuring plant type for higher productivity Restructuring of plant architecture has played a key role in enhancing the yield potential of severalcrops, including wheat and rice. There is a need to bring a drastic change to existing types of plantpulses to realize a breakthrough in productivity. The plants should be physiologically efficient toallow more solar light interception and have proper partitioning of photosynthates. We may needdifferent plant types for rainfed and irrigated conditions. Pulses have long been grown on marginalsoils under rainfed conditions with minimum inputs. The available cultivars, which have beendeveloped taking into account these harsh growing conditions, do not respond favourably to highinput conditions (application of fertilizer and irrigations). High input conditions, particularly in deepblack soils (vertisols) or heavy textured soils, may stimulate excessive vegetative growth leadingto poor pod set, lodging, reduced harvest index, reduced grain yield and poor seed quality. Thus,we need varieties which are responsive to inputs, have high input use efficiency, resist excessivevegetative growth and lodging and have high biomass coupled with high harvest index. Machine harvestable varieties Mechanization would play a key role in modernization of pulse production in India. Mechanizationcontributes to timeliness of operations, reduces cost of production and improves resource useefficiency. Farmers need pulse varieties which can be directly harvested by combine harvesters. Thecurrent varieties of most of the pulses are not suited to mechanical harvesting because the plantheight is not adequate and the branches are close to ground due to semi-spreading growth habit.Thus, there is a need to develop varieties with semi-erect to erect growth habit and minimum20 cm ground clearance for their suitability to mechanical harvesting. Herbicide tolerance Manual weeding, currently being used in pulse for removal of seasonal weeds, is becomingexpensive and in some cases is uneconomical due to rising labour costs. There is a need to developpost-emergence herbicide tolerant varieties so that herbicides can be used effectively for weedmanagement. Weed management by herbicides will not only be economical but also facilitateno-till methods, which help preserve topsoil. This will further help in horizontal expansion of pulseslike, urad beans, lentils and chickpeas in rice-fallows or cereal-pulse cropping systems.VII. Technical papers 165Climate smart varieties The expected impacts of climate change include temperature extremities (frost, cold, heat), erratic and unpredictable rainfall patterns (more intense rainfall events and less light rainfall events) andmore frequent floods and droughts. Thus, there is a need to develop climate smart varieties whichare resilient (better recovery after stress) to climate change. Enhanced drought tolerance isrequired in all the pulses. Heat tolerance would be important for post-rainy season pulses, such aschickpeas and lentils. It will also be important for rainy season pulses, mungbeans and urdbeansfor their cultivation in spring/summer. Waterlogging tolerance would be required in rainy seasonpulses, such as pigeon peas, mungbeans and urdbeans. The frequent waterlogging in some areasalso increases soil salinity and the available cultivars of major pulses are sensitive to soil salinity,thus there is a need to develop salinity tolerant cultivars. With continuous rains during harvest,pre-harvest sprouting in mungbeans and urdbeans often occurs, thus efforts should be made todevelop cultivars tolerant to pre-harvest sprouting. Climate change could also affect occurrenceof insect-pests and diseases. Severity of some of these biotic stresses may increase, such as dry rootrot and collar rot in chickpeas and lentils, and new insect-pests and diseases may emerge.Thus, tolerance to these stresses must be an integral activity in the development of climate smartvarieties. Furthermore, strong forecasting and forewarning modules are necessary to predict theincidence of these pests well in advance. Hybrids in pigeonpeas Pigeonpeas are the only pulse crop where development of commercial hybrids has been possible.This is because pigeon peas are an often cross-pollinated crop. A few cytoplasmic-nuclear male-sterility (CMS) based hybrids have been released in India, which have demonstrated 30-40 percentyield advantage in farmers' fields in some pockets of the country. There is a need to diversify thesources of CMS systems and incorporate resistance to key diseases and insect-pests in the parentallines. Hybrids should be developed in different matur ity groups to cater to the needs of different geographic regions and the cropping systems. Reduced maturity duration Sustainable intensification of cropping systems is the key to enhancing agricultural productionwhere there is little scope of bringing additional area under cultivation. Early maturing varietieswill help in bringing pulses in non-traditional seasons or between two cereal crops as a catch crop.Vast rice-fallow areas (~14 million ha) available in South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal) offeropportunities to expand the area of post-rainy season pulses, such as chickpeas and lentils. As thesowing is delayed due to late harvest of rice, early/extra-early varieties are needed to escapeend-of-season stresses in rice-fallows. Enhanced phosphorus acquisition efficiency (PAE) Phosphorus (P) is vital to plant function but is a finite resource in nature. There is a continuous risein costs of P fertilizers in India as most of the P fertilizers are imported. However, a lot of P isavailable in fixed forms in soil which can be made available to pulse crops if varieties withenhanced phosphorus acquisition efficiency (PAE) and responsive to phosphorus solubilisingbacteria (PSB) are developed. Research is required to develop reliable screening techniques for PAE,identify genotypes with greater PAE and unravel mechanisms that contribute to PAE. Integrationof genomic approaches would help in introgressing PAE in available high yielding cultivars.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 166Exploitation of wild species and transgenics for insect resistance Pod borer continues to be a major and challenging insect-pest of pulses. It has not been possible to develop varieties with high levels of resistance to pod borer due to the non-availability ofsources with high levels of resistance in the germplasm of cultivated species. Higher levels ofresistance have been observed in some wild species and efforts should be made to exploit thesewild species in improving pod borer resistance. Gr eater chances for development of pod borer resistant cultivars exist through application of transgenic technology. Concerted efforts are neededon using different transgenes and promoter options for developing transgenic events and theirevaluations for effectiveness and bio-safety. Protein enhancement and bio-fortification Pulses are a good source of protein, carbohydrates, dietary fibre, minerals (Fe, Zn, Ca and Mg) andother important nutrients that are essential for human health and development. There is for scopefurther improvement in the nutritional quality of pulses. Protein content of present day cultivarsis usually in the range of 18-22 percent whereas much larger variability (14-32 percent) exists inthe germplasm which could potentially be exploited to develop high protein ( 25 percent) varieties. Similarly, wide variation has been observed for iron and zinc contents in the germplasm,which can be exploited to develop high iron and zinc varieties. It is important to developnutritionally enhanced varieties as consumers would get a higher amount of protein and othernutrients from the same amount of pulses consumed. Refinement of agronomic practices for crop establishment in rainfed-rice fallows One of the constraints in growing pulses in rainfed rice-fallows is crop establishment. Current field preparation methods lead to losses of moisture. Thus, sowing of pulses in rice-fallows has to be done with minimum or zero tillage. The soil type and soil texture may vary from one location toanother location and, thus, may have different agronomic requirements for optimum cropestablishment. The agronomic practices need to be standardized including seed priming and seedtreatment with fungicides/insecticides, application of rhizobium inoculant, and sowing method(relay cropping, seed dibbling and sowing with zero till seed drill). Modernization of pulses breeding programmes The application of novel methods and tools in breeding programmes is needed to improveefficiency and effectiveness so that higher genetic gains can be achieved and the time requiredfor development of a variety can be reduced. Breeding programmes should have access tocontroled environment facilities (green houses, growth chambers) for rapid generationadvancement of breeding materials and phenotyping platforms for high throughput screening ofgenetic materials and use of electronic field books and data management systems for increasingefficiency. There has been rapid progress in development of low cost genotyping platforms andgenomic resources in the recent years. We now have the draft genome sequence available for mostof the pulses. Integrated breeding involving genomic approaches needs to be used for higherprecision and efficiency of breeding programmes. Pulses breeding programmes should be able todevelop varieties in the shortest possible time as per need of farmers, consumers and theindustries.VII. Technical papers 167Development and outreach activities with available improved cultivars and technologies Promotion of pulses cultivation in rice-fallows Vast areas of rice-fallows (~14 million ha), available in South Asia (India, Bangladesh and Nepal, offer opportunities to expand the area (2.0 to 3.0 mha) of post-rainy season pulses, such as chickpeas,and lentils. A holistic farming system approach would be required for cultivation of pulses in therainfed rice-fallows. This includes promoting (1) cultivation of early maturing paddy in the rainyseason, so that the fields are vacated early for timely sowing of pulses, (2) cultivation of pulsevarieties suitable for rice-fallows (early growth vigor, early to extra-early maturity, and tolerance toreproductive stage heat stress), (3) suitable agronomic practices (seed priming, sowing under zeroor minimum tillage condition) for ensuring optimum plant population in rainfed rice-fallows, and(4) integrated crop management practices (nutrients, weeds, insect-pests, diseases, etc.). Bringing additional area under pulses through intercropping and sequential cropping Ample scope exists for promotion of pulses in intercropping and sequential cropping. Short-duration pigeon pea varieties are now available which can mature in 120-130 days and allowsowing of a post rainy season crop, such as wheat. There are several niches for intercropping ofpulses with cereals and other crops which can be exploited for enhancing areas with pulses,maximizing profitability and increasing cropping system sustainability. Knowledge empowerment of stakeholders There has been a slow adoption of improved varieties and production technologies of pulses byfarmers in several states. Many farmers are still growing decades old varieties and making little orno investment in crop management. In some cases, this is simply because the farmers do not haveadequate information about the improved varieties and production technologies. Increasedadoption of improved cultivars and production technologies are very much needed to enhancethe yield of pulses. Thus, concerted efforts are needed on knowledge empowerment of farmers andextension personnel. This can be achieved by organizing training programmes and variousawareness activities through field days/farmers' fairs and electronic and print media. Special effortsshould be made to encourage participation of women farmers. In some cases, it can be achievedthrough organizing training programmes and field days exclusively for women farmers. Farmerparticipatory trials/demonstrations are very helpful in convincing farmers of the benefit ofimproved cultivars and technologies. Distribution of small seed samples (2-5 kg) to a large numberof farmers would help in the rapid spread of new varieties. Expanding pigeon pea hybrid production Hybrids have been developed in pigeon peas, which offer huge potential for enhancing pigeonpeayield, which has remained almost stagnant around 700 kg/ha during the past five decades. Somecommercial pigeonpea hybrids, such as ICPH 2671 and ICPH 2740 are already available in India.A large number of demonstrations on farmers' fields were conducted in several states of India inwhich the hybrids gave 25 to 40 percent higher yield than the open pollinated varieties (OPVs).Concerted efforts are needed on production of hybrid seed and promotion of hybrid pigeonpeacultivation in India, Nepal and Myanmar.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 168Improving access of farmers to seed One of the major bottlenecks in spread of new varieties is the inadequate availability of quality seed for farmers at the local level and at the right time. Several old varieties are still in the seedchain. There is a need for enhancing seed availability of new varieties. In addition to public seedcorporations, seed societies and private companies should be involved in seed production. Integrated nutrient management Proper nutrient management based on soil analysis is important for maximizing productivity ofpulses. Farmers generally provide only major nutrients like phosphorus (P), and in some casesPotash (K). The secondary nutrients, such as sulphur (S) and the micronutrients, such as zinc (Zn),boron (B) and molybdenum (Mo) are ignored. Widespread deficiencies have been observed forthese secondary nutrients and micronutrients in pulse growing areas. The experiments conductedsuggested that applications of each of these nutrients can increase pulse yields in the range of10 to 25 percent depending on the extent of deficiency. Thus, there is a need for developing a soilmap for availability of nutrients for each state to recommend applications of nutrients accordingly.It is also important to ensure availability of the fertilizers/micronutrients for farmers at the locallevel and at the right time. Promoting ridge and furrow method of planting in rainy season pulses Waterlogging causes severe damage to rainy season pulses, such as pigeonpeas, mungbeans andurdbeans. Experiments have shown that ridge and furrow method of planting can avoidwaterlogging of the crops and the diseases associated with waterlogging (e.g. phytophthora blightin pigeonpeas). A large number of demonstrations should be conducted on ridge and furrow method of planting in rainy season pulses. The tractor driven ridge makers should be available to farmers on custom hiring. Promotion of micro-irrigation Pulses are largely grown under rainfed conditions and moisture stress leads to a reduction inproductivity. Sub-optimal moisture in the soil at the time of sowing leads to poor germination andplant stand. High emphasis should be given to water conservation so that the pulses receiverequired number of irrigations. Water saving irrigation methods, such as sprinkler and dripirrigation should be promoted. Integrated pest management Pod borer causes heavy yield losses in pulses (chickpeas, pigeonpeas) if not managed. Similarly,thrips in spring/summer in mungbeans; and aphids in lentils cause huge crop losses. There is aneed to promote integrated pest management (IPM) approaches for managing these insect-pests.An effective pest surveillance mechanism should be put in place at district/block level and regionspecific advisories should be given to farmers to assist in pest management. Enhancing mechanization of pulse cultivation Increasing mechanization is important for making the cultivation of pulses more profitable andattractive to farmers. One of the keys to success for production of cereals has been mechanizationof farm operations. Now, the cultivation of wheat and rice is mostly mechanized. Even farmers withsmallholdings can afford mechanization because of the availability of farm implements on customhiring. Mechanization would play a key role in modernization of agriculture due to its benefits ofimproved labour efficiency and productivity, efficient use of expensive farm inputs, reduction ofVII. Technical papers 169human drudgery and timeliness of operations. Line sowing by seed drills or ridge maker-come- planters should be promoted in the states where farmers are still using seed broad casting forsowing. Harvesting by combine harvesters should be promoted for the crops where suitablevarieties are available. Machine harvestable chickpea varieties have recently been released in India.Cultivation of these varieties needs to be promoted. Policy support Procurement of pulses at minimum support prices, market intelligence research, input supplies,promotion of micro-irrigation, increased and sustained investment in technology development anddissemination, farm mechanization and, value addition are the areas where immediate attentionneeds to be paid. Investment in the storage sector needs to be enhanced to ensure quality seedsupply. Farmers can be encouraged to store seeds of pulses or grains in such stores on a paymentbasis. Credit facilities for farmers can be extended on the basis of seed/grain stored in such places. Asian network for research, development and outreach activities on pulses There is a need to enhance greater cooperation among Asian countries for research, developmentand outreach activities on pulses. The Asian Grain Legumes Network (AGLN) was established in1986 by ICRISAT in partnership with 11 Asian countries. The AGLN focused on the three ICRISAT-mandate legumes (chickpeas, pigeonpeas and groundnuts) and facilitated and coordinatedcollaborative research activities on these crops to generate appropriate technologies by moreeffectively using existing staff and facilities in member countries. Later in 1992, the AGLN and theCooperative Cereals Research Network (CCRN) were merged to form the Cereals and Legumes AsiaNetwork (CLAN). The CLAN is also coordinated by ICRISAT and includes all five ICRISAT-mandatecrops (sorghum, pearl millet, chickpeas, pigeonpeas and groundnuts). The CLAN received fundingsupport from the Asian Development Bank up to 1999. Because of a lack of funding support, therehave been very limited activities in CLAN during the past 15 years. There is a need to have an activenetwork similar to AGLN to enhance cooperation among Asian countries for development andexchange of technologies on pulses.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 170VII. Technical papers Partha Sarathi Basu ICAR-Indian Institute of Pulses Research Kanpur, India Abstract More than 50 percent of the pulses in the world are grown in south and southeast Asian countries. The productivity of all rainfed crops because of their dependence on rain isincreasingly threatened by high temperatures and drought caused by climate change. Themajority of the pulse growing countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan,Myanmar, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand are particularly vulnerable to the impacts ofclimate change due to their strategic geogr aphical locations in the mid-north latitude nearer to the equator where maximum threshold temperature for tolerance of pulses has alreadyreached 35\u00baC. A further rise in temperature, as is evident now, will adversely affect theproductivity of pulses in these areas. Increased CO 2 levels in the atmosphere is not beneficial for pulses grown under stressed environments. Both drought and heat are recurrent phenomena in south and southeasterncountries. Gene mining for stress tolerance from diverse germplasm collections, including wildspecies will remain the great strength for evolving newer varieties tolerant to multiple abioticstresses. Strategies have been made to develop climate resilient varieties based upon screeningof a large number of germplasms available worldwide. Early flowering, short duration, fasterbiomass accumulation, deep root system, high water-use efficiency and high root proliferationbefore the onset of terminal drought and heat have been found to be the best strategy toescape abiotic stresses. The reproductive component of the pulses is very sensitive to hightemperature. A number of genotypes have been identified as tolerant to heat stress based onreproductive stage tolerance, including fertile pollens and pod formation. The mechanisms of heat and drought tolerance in pulses have been deciphered. Drought- specific genes, Dreb 1A, used for developing drought-tolerantchickpeas and pigeonpeas. Drought-specific signal molecules ABA and its role in droughttolerance have been characterized. Identification of linked quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for rootand high yield and marker-assisted selection (MAS) opened new horizons in the field ofdrought research. Rapid advancements in genomics provide an opportunity for molecularmapping of QTL controlling heat tolerance and using marker-assisted breeding fordevelopment of heat tolerant varieties with suitable agronomic background and desired seedtraits. Molecular markers will be soon available for major heat tolerance QTL in some legumeswhich will further facilitate breeding for heat and drought tolerance. The latitudinal differenceis very important in considering the productivity of pulses in Southeast Asian countries in theperspective of global climate change and accordingly strategies have to be made towardsdevelopment of pulse varieties.Impact of climate changes on pulse development in AsiaProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 172Introduction Global climate change is driven by the rise in temperature caused primarily by anthropogenic activities, including indiscriminate burning of fossil fuels, which leads to increases in the CO2 level in the atmosphere along with other greenhouse gases trapping the infrared radiation (heat)received from sun. This phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect and is the primary causeof global warming. The rise in temperature is likely to threaten food security of South Asian countries, including India, as these parts of the world are geographically located in areas that havebeen declared as most vulnerable to climate change. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and other Southeast Asian countries are producing about 50 percent of total worldpulses. Climate change projections indicate that agricultural productivity in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam may decrease from 2020 onwards. Asian countries like India, Pakistan,Bangladesh, Myanmar, Bhutan, Nepal, China, Lao PDR, Sri Lanka, Viet Nam and Cambodia growpulses and consume them in different forms. These are the countries that suffer from malnutritionto a great extent and pulses remain one of the important dietary components for cheap protein.Among these countries, India is both the largest producer and consumers of pulses. The majorpulses grown in India and Southeast Asian countries include chickpeas, pigeonpeas, greengrams,blackgrams, lentils, soybeans, field peas as major pulses, whereas cowpeas, horse grams, faba beans,kidney beans, rice beans and Adjuki beans are minor pulses. Among those pulses, chickpeas,pigeonpeas, lentils, cowpeas, horse grams have better tolerance to drought compared withgreengrams, blackgrams and field peas. Asian pulses are highly vulnerable to climate change because they are grown under rainfed conditions in high temperature zones due to their proximity to equator. These countries are densely populated and the majority of the pulse growers are poor and have marginal land holdings. Drought and high temperature both have become recurrent events during the present climate change scenario. Agriculture is the foremost victim of climate change as the productivity ofimportant food crops is largely dependent upon the availability of water. Rainfed pulses areexpected to suffer with severe water crisis owing to delayed monsoons, uneven distribution or thecomplete failure of rains. Rainfed agriculture is particularly vulnerable as rainfed crops arepredominantly dependent upon rainfall and failure or scanty rain often leads to very poorproductivity. As rainfed crops, vulnerability of pulses to climate change is higher and more severebecause heat stress during the reproductive phase is often combined with terminal drought. Thus,reduction in yields is often more pronounced and the damaging effects of both stresses are farmore severe than their individual effects. A parallel increase in CO 2 gas and temperature has been observed during the past two decades. An average surface temperature may increase by 5\u00baC with doubling of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. The rate of increase of CO2 is about 2 mol mol-1 per year and is expected to reach up to 670 mol mol-1 by the end of this century. It is projected that if carbon emissions are not regulated globally, the atmospheric CO2 level may become almost double (670 mol mol-1) from the present level of 380 mol mol-1 by the end of this century, consequently, temperature is to rise between 3.5 and 5\u00baC. As is evident, the rise in the global temperature would influence thehydrological cycles due to change in the land and sea surface temperature, deviation of monsoons,erratic, scanty or often heavy rainfall changing the pattern of rainfall distribution and acceleratingmelting of polar ice causing a rise in the water level of the sea leading to an increase in the salinityof the long stretched coastal agricultural field. The most vulnerable areas are the arid, semi-arid,and dry sub-humid regions where pulses are grown. In lower latitudes, even small amounts ofwarming will tend to decrease yields.VII. Technical papers 173In many parts of South and Southeast Asia, pulses are already being cultivated near their maximum temperature tolerance 35-40\u00baC. Under rainfed conditions, vulnerabilities are still high and evenmoderate warming of 1\u00baC will reduce yields of pulses significantly. However, possible yieldincreases and precipitation have been predicted in regions of northern latitude where crops areusually grown under cool temperate conditions. Crop yields benefit from higher latitudes throughlonger growing seasons (IPCC, 2007). Agricultural crops under mid-latitudes (north) may suffer from heat stress because of an increase in temperature above average and dryer summers with reduced yields as the net predicted result.The regions falling under north-mid latitude covering are already experiencing high summertemperatures often exceeding 35\u00baC. Most of the agricultural crops have a maximum temperature tolerance limit of 35\u00baC, beyond which anthesis and particularly reproduction process is adverselyaffected. Particularly, C 3 crops including pulses have a temperature tolerance limit for optimum physiological function within the range of 30-35\u00baC. Even Vigna groups of pulses green grams andblackgrams grown during summer are often exposed to high temperatures beyond 40-42\u00baC, whichhas overall detrimental effects on grain yield. The negative effects of high temperature is usuallycompensated for by irrigation lowering the canopy temperature, however, availability of water forpulses is very difficult in rainfed growing areas. Temperature tolerance limit of pulses and genetic diversity Genetic diversity has been exploited for development of cold tolerant varieties of pulses withinthe sub-optimal temperature range within 0-14\u00baC. However, temperature below 5\u00baC for longerperiod often becomes lethal for pulses. Foliage growth usually ceases or reduces in most of thewinter pulses such as chickpeas, and lentils growing at low temperature range 6-15\u00baC. Most varieties of pulses are well adapted to optimum temp erature range falling between 15 to 35\u00baC but can have the ability to tolerate up to a maximum limit of 45\u00baC, though with significant reductionof photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, decreased foliage growth and inducing massive pollensterility with progressive increases in the temperature beyond 35\u00baC. A temperature rise up to 42-45\u00baC even for a short period may induce forced maturity, leaf senescence, pollen sterility and causes failure of anthesis. Grain filling is adversely affected in youngpods that recently set seeds exposed to high temperature above 42\u00baC and as a result further seeddevelopment abruptly terminates and such impaired seeds never restore to their normalconditions even when temperature becomes favourable afterwards. These immature seeds usuallydo not imbibe during water soaking and remain hardy. Most of the research efforts for improvingheat tolerance in pulses are based upon exploitation of genetic diversity of heat tolerancewithinthe temperature range between 36\u00baC and 45\u00baC. Temperatures above 45\u00baC is considered to be lethal for most of the pulses as it causes irreversible physiological changes at cellular level, aggregation of macromolecules, massive destruction of thephotosynthesis process leading to complete inhibition and no fertilization takes place at thisextreme temperature. Perhaps no cultivar of pulses is reported to have tolerance beyond 45\u00baC.Genetic diversity rarely exists in such high temperatures except for some wild relatives that mightpossess tolerance a few degrees above the maximum tolerance level of 45\u00baC. Occurrence of genetic diversity in pulses within the optimal temperature range 15-35\u00baC is very high indicating that irrespective of the origin of the pulses (temperate, sub-temperate, tropical,sub-tropical), the probability of adaptation is very high within the optimal temperature zone.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 174Dew precipitation for sustaining growth in cool-season pulses Observations recorded over the last two to three decades in pulse growing areas of northern India revealed an astonishing fact about low dew precipitation. The dew precipitation in fact is graduallyvanishing during winter as a result of high night temperature. Normal dew during December andJanuary may contribute the equivalent of about 150 mm of rainfall which is considered to be quiteadequate for rainfed pulses. The patterns of maximum and minimum temperatures also showedan unusual trend. There is an asymmetric increase in the temperature reflected in the steadyincrease of night time minimums compared with day-time maximums. This caused narrowingdown the differences between day and night temperature and average temperature increasedsignificantly and unfavourably affecting grain filling that usually takes place during relatively lowtemperature at night. The simultaneous increase in average temperature is expected to hasten thematurity and shorten the crop duration. Cool-season legumes will be subjected to severeatmospheric drought and may likely to require supplemental irrigation if present trends continues.Climate change may alter both distribution and frequency of rainfall and may likely increase thenumber of heavy rainfall and decrease the number of rainy days. Rise in mean surface temperatureis likely to cause a 70 percent decline in summer rainfall by 2050. Scanty rainfall in some areas maylead to increased demand for irrigation water because of evaporative losses affecting rates ofdecomposition of organic matters and release of nutrients and decline of soil fertility. About2.5 billion people in South Asia are likely to be affected by water scarcity by 2050 (UNDP 2006). Rising temperature, changing precipitation and more extreme weather events lead to low water availability impacting hydrological cycles of evaporation and precipitation. This will drasticallyaffect agriculture production in a region where over 60 percent of the agriculture is rainfed, suchas in India. On the other hand, climate change can also increase the occurrence of floods. SouthernAsia's increased temperatures resulted in diminished precipitation. Increased temperatures maycause longer-lasting droughts. Large areas in South Asia are currently experiencing water deficits.Changing patterns in the monsoon are a threat to agriculture, food security, and the overalleconomy. The onset of the summer monsoon in India is getting delayed and disturbed. This affects crop cycles and cultivation in rainfed areas. Will pulses be benefitted by CO2 rise in the atmosphere? Crop response to high CO2 in the atmosphere varies among crop species. It is generally believed that CO2 fertilization may improve photosynthesis in crop species. However, increased photosynthesis under higher CO2 concentrations has been often observed under optimum temperature and light if the plant is not experiencing any stresses. For the majority of the pulsesgrown in rainfed conditions, water stress is a recurrent phenomenon and pulses may not benefitfrom increased CO 2 levels due to the combined effects of terminal drought and heat stress during the reproductive phase. In countries geogr aphically located in northern mid-latitudes, such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and other Southeast Asian countries, the day-time temperature isalready exceeding 35\u00baC during the reproductive phase and further temperature rises due to globalwarming may be likely to reduce yield to a considerable extent. High temperatures above 35\u00baCoften combined with low soil moisture result in reduced grain yield in most of the regions closerto the tropics. On the contrary, pulses grown in northern latitudes where temperate climateprevails, temperature rises along with CO2 may be beneficial for the pulses as the threshold tolerance limit of 35\u00baC-40\u00baC has not yet been crossed. Nitrogen fixation ability of pulses at higher temperature Another important issue related to climate change-i nduced temperature rise is a reduction in the biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by legumes. N-fixation is very sensitive to high temperature andalmost ceases beyond 35\u00baC. Nodule growth is adversely affected during podding stages coincidingwith high temperatures. It has been reported that the occurrence of nodule formation and BNFVII. Technical papers 175is adversely affected beyond 35\u00baC, therefore, a lack of nitrogen in the leaves may lead to decreased protein content and also may likely enhance starch content in the seeds. Because pulses areefficient carbon sinks, high CO 2 and temperatures are likely to increase the content of starch and decrease that of protein in pulses. About 60 percent carbon and nitrogen reserve in leaf and stemsin cool-season pulses support grain filling through post-anthesis remobilization under normalconditions. The proportion of carbon gain in seeds will be more over nitrogen due to low BNFactivities resulting in reduced protein content in pulse grains. There will be an overall decrease in the remobilization efficiency due to high night temperature. Leaf nitrogen content drastically declines at high temperature >37\u00baC. Nodulation and nitrogenfixation almost terminate at high temperature and the crop is subjected to nitrogen starvation, ifnitrogen fertilizer is not added. Exogenous application may prove beneficial to improve yield underheat stress. Abiotic stresses as influenced by climate change Drought and heat stresses are major concerns influenced by climate change. Both these stressesare often superimposed on each other and reduce yield by more than 40 percent in pulses. Thesestresses a affect wide range of physiological processes and alter plant-water relationships(Summerfield et al., 1984). Heat stress above 35\u00baC often causes irreversible damage to growth and development (Wahid et al . 2007). Cool-season legumes optimally function between the temperature range 15-35\u00baC, biomass growth and particularly reproduction are partially orcompletely arrested beyond 40\u00baC, though duration of exposure to high temperature has a profound effect on these physiological processes (Ali et al., 2009 and Basu, 2010). Grain legumes are ranked in the following order: mung beans > pigeonpeas > urd beans > chickpeas > lentils > rajmashs > fieldpeas for their tolerance to heat stress. Stategies have to bemade to develop heat and drought tolerant varieties of pulses with improved yield for warmerclimates based upon specific physiological attributes such as early flowering, short duration,vigorous root system and large seed size with quick biomass accumulation. In general, all pulsesare highly sensitive to salinity and waterlogging. Frost and waterlogging are highly damaging forpigeonpeas. In fact, temperature extremes both higher and lower are more detrimental to pigeonpeas in terms of flower drop. While, chickpeas, lentils and fieldpeas are more adapted to lowtemperature. Sensitivity of pulses to abiotic stresses is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Sensitivity of different pulses to abiotic stresses Crop Climatic conditions Sensitivity to abiotic stresses Sensitive to water logging and temperature extremities both temperature below 7\u00baC and above 40\u00baC (pigeonpea) All these pulses, e.g. pigeonpea, chickpea and lentil have moderate to high level of drought tolerance with deep taproot, high water use efficiency (WUE) and osmotic adjustment(chickpea, pigeonpea, lentil) Estimated yield loss 40-60% (drought and heat combined) Moderate tolerance to drought Photoperiod sensitive/quantitative short day Low WUE ans photosynthetic rates Less drymatter and recover slowly after droughtDeeper roots, short flowering & maturity Faster stomatal closure during drought Reduced growth & leaf expansion during drought Estimated yield reduction 20-45% due to high temp >40\u00baCPigeonpeas ChickpeasLentils Warm 30\u00baS latitude Rainfall 600-1 000 mm Temperature 15-30\u00baCProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 176Response of different pulses to climate change The reproductive parts and grain filling process are extremely sensitive to chilling and high temperature. The combined effect of heat and drought is more detrimental than the effects ofdrought and heat alone, as a result the productivity further goes down (Basu et al., 2009). Pigeon peas, in particular, are highly sensitive to temperature fluctuations, causing massive flower drop,forced drying and bending of apical leaves when subjected to cold stress (<5\u00baC) (Basu et al., 2009). In greengrams, temperatures above 42\u00baC during summer causes seed hardening owing to incomplete sink development. Field peas are better adapted to low temperature than other winter pulses like lentils and chickpeas showing retarded growth below 7\u00baC. Daytime maximums beyond40\u00baC during the reproductive phase in winter pulses results in complete failure of anthesis, podsetting and induces hardening of seeds. The failure of an thesis at high temperature is primarily caused by poor pollen germination, stigma receptivity, pollen load on stigma and ovule viabilityabove 35\u00baC (Basu et al ., 2009). Field peas are even more sensitive to high temperatures than chickpeas and lentils. A reduction in pollen germination occurs above 38\u00baC. Physiological changes associated with abiotic stresses Pulses are particularly sensitive to heat stress at the bloom stage; only a few days of exposure tohigh temperatures (30-35\u00baC) can cause heavy yield losses through flower drop or pod abortion(Siddique et al., 1999). Low biomass and forced maturity are the manifestation of high temperature in pulse crops. Biomass decreases significantly under short and warm winters, less dewprecipitation, and high night temperature. T he late flowering chickpea genotypes with low biomass often encounter sudden high temperature dur ing anthesis. Short-duration varieties growing in central and southern zones of India do not encounter such contrasting temperatures. Short-duration bold-seeded chickpea genotypes, e.g. ICC 4958, Phule G5 bred for warmer southern zonesof India have high biomass and deep root systems compared with the medium to late maturingchickpea genotypes KWR 108, C235 and Pant G114 bred in the northern plains of India (Basuet al ., 2014). The deeper root system supports water extraction from deep soils to meet water requirements of high evapotranspiration demand under warm climates of South India whileshallow rooting genotypes of northern India are equipped for faster and efficient water absorptionfrom top soil layers saturated with dew precipitation (Basu et al., 2007). Seed size reduces with the majority of chickpea genotypes having reduced, shrivelled or deformed grains at high temperatures exceeding 35\u00baC. Critic al temperature causing damage of reproductive organs was found to range between 35\u00baC and 40\u00baC, however, sensitivity varies among genotypes.Pollen germination in other crops has been reported to have higher vulnerability at hightemperatures, and the degree of pollen tube growth is reduced significantly (Kakani et al., 2005). Pollen germination in pepper is drastically reduced when grown at 38\u00baC compared with 25\u00baC(Kafizadeh et al. , 2008). Brief exposure of chickpeas to high temperatures during seed filling accelerates senescence, diminishes seed set and weight and reduces yield (Siddique et al., 1999). In pulses, remobilization of pre-anthesis reserve carbohydrates and nitrogen in leaves and stems contribute significantly towards grain filling. Therefore, biomass is the main factor determininggrain yield in the majority of the pulses grown during winter season. Under climate change,a sudden rise in the temperature beyond 35\u00baC causes increased respiration rates and unusuallyhigh degradation of stored starch in the chloroplasts. The reduced or incomplete graindevelopment could be partly due to an inadequate supply of carbon and nitrogen from leaves orby a decrease in the activity of sucrose synthase, the key enzyme for grain development.VII. Technical papers 177Effect of high temperatures on physiological traits Prolonged exposure to warm environment may likely deactivate the photoperiodic receptors causing a reduction of phenotypic plasticity and induction of early flowering, senescence andforced maturity, accelerated pollen sterility and eventual reduction of yield. High temperature isone of the factors causing enhanced crop respiration and transpiration rates along with reducedphotosynthesis, as a result, loss of water and carbon is more accelerated than carbon gain throughphotosynthesis affecting overall biomass accumulation. There will be obvious effects of alteredcarbon metabolism on photosynthate partitioning to grain. Temperature rise in lower latituderegions accelerates the rate of respiration leading to sub-optimal growth. Higher daytimetemperature accelerates plant maturity and results in reduced grain filling, while higher nighttemperatures increase yield losses due to higher rate of respiration. Extreme high and lowtemperatures cause physical injuries to cr op plants and damage the grain. Injuries are inflicted by high temperatures on the exposed area of plants, scorching leaves and dehydrating the plant.Young seedlings dehydrate quickly when soil temperature rises. Episodic heat waves can reduceyields, particularly when they occur during sensitive developing stages, such as the reproductivephase which increases sterility. Higher levels of ozone in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) alsolimits crop growth. Cellular membrane stability decreases at high temperature in cowpeas (Ismail and Hall, 1999). Exposure of (chickpeas and pigeon peas) to 35\u00baC for 24 hours reduced the membrane stability, butgenetic differences in membrane stability is evident (Srinivasan et al. , 1996). Chlorophyll fluorescence (maximum quantum yield of PSII-Fv/Fm) indicates inhibition of thylakoid stability/photochemical efficiency under heat stress in pigeon peas and chickpeas (Srinivasan et al. 1996). In common beans, high temperatures can affect nitrogen fixation and plasma membrane integrity(Shonnard and Gepts, 1994). In temperate legumes high heat stress affects structure and functionof nodules whereas, it affects nitrogen fixation efficiency in tropical legumes (Bordeleau andPr\u00e9vost, 1994). Even under moderate day/night Phaseolus vulgaris ) rapid degeneration of nodules occurs affecting the nitrogen fixing efficiency of the plant (Graham, 1979).The studies indicate that high temperatures affect root/shoot growth and cause damage tofruits/pods. Further, leaf senescence and abscission are increased under high temperature. Incowpeas, under warmer temperatures leaf area index increased and leaf death occurred sooner(Littleton et al., 1979). Under heat stress conditions in legumes the amount of root mass produced is reduced, fewer lateral roots are observed and the roots produced are thin and unbranched(Bordeleau and Pr\u00e9vost, 1994). High soil temperature (38\u00baC) in groundnuts reduces dry matteraccumulation and seed mass coupled with decreased flower production. The fluorescence imagesof heat sensitive chickpea genotype ICC 10685 showed photosynthesis at43\u00baC, while heat tolerant genotype ICCV 92944 showed reduced photosynthesis but leaf remainedphotosynthetically active even at 43\u00baC. Similarly, the heat tolerant chickpea genotype ICCV 92944showed the lowest membrane injury when subjected to high temperature and sensitive lineICC 10685 had the maximum injury. Particularly, male reproductive organs development is more prone to high temperature damage compared to the female (Monterroso and Wien 1990). A reduction in number of flowers borne(Laurie and Stewart 1993) and the duration of flowering and pod filling (van Rheenen, 1997) wasobserved in chickpeas under high temperature. The heat stress causes reduction in pod set byreducing pollen viability and pollen production per flower (Devasirvatham et al. , 2012) in chickpeas. The pollen of heat tolerant chickpea genotype (ICCV 92944) was viable at 35/20\u00baC (41 percentfertile) and at 40/25\u00baC (13 percent fertbile), whereas the pollen of heat sensitive genotype(ICC 5912) was completely sterile at 35/20\u00baC with no in vitro germination. However, the stigma of the sensitive genotype (ICC 5912) remained receptive at 35/20\u00baC and non-stressed pollenProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 178(27/16\u00baC) germinated on it during reciprocal crossing. These data indicate that pollen grains were more sensitive to high temperature than the stigma in chickpeas. Both anthers and pollen showed more structural abnormalities under stress such as changes in anther locule number, anther epidermis wall thickening and pollen sterility, rather than function(e.g. in vivo pollen tube growth). The critical temperature for pod set was 37\u00baC in heat tolerant chickpea genotypes (ICC 1205 and ICC and 33\u00baC chickpea genotypes (ICC 4567 and ICC 10685). In mungbeans, high temperature increases flower shedding (Sinha, 1977)and pollen sterility and dehiscence of anthers in cowpeas (Hall, 1992,). Heat stress affects flowerinitiation, flowering, pollen formation, fertilization and pod set/development in common beans(Shonnard and Gepts, 1994) and pea (Guilioni et al ., 1997). High night temperatures affect pod and seed set in common beans, lima beans and cowpeas (Shonnard and Gepts, 1994). Development of climate resilient varieties in pulses Precision phenotyping and multilocation field trials at hot spots across different agro-ecological zones Screening of pigeon pea germplasm showed wide variability in osmotic adjustment (OA) rangingbetween 0.2 and 1.6 MPa or even higher, 5.0 MPa for wild pigeonpeas. A number of varieties havebeen identified showing high osmotic adjustment under drought. These todrought condition. A large number of genotypes from diverse genetic resources of pulses have been identified as tolerant to multiple stresses. Among these, wild progenitors of various pulseswere found to possess very high levels of tolerance to drought and heat or both combined.Combined tolerance to heat and drought has been identified in wild accessions of pigeonpeasCajanas scarabaeoides Wild accession ICP 15671 had very high osmotic adjustment with pod setting ability at 40\u00baC A majority of the blackgram and greengram genotypes are lacking osmotic adjustment and thus remain sensitive to drought. Few blackgram and greengram lines showed osmotic adjustment tothe maximum extent up to 0.4 MPa. These ML 5 ofgreengram. Very little or lack of osmotic adjustment ability causes less tolerance to drought inblackgram and greengram and thus require irrigation. The wild relatives of pulses are the potentialsources for gene mining for heat and drought tolerance due to the following reasons. Wild and extant varieties could have traits tolerant to high temperature/elevated CO2. They might have been discarded in the past because of low yield potential. They can be used as parents for breeding of varieties tolerant to climate change. There is need for revisiting gene banks with a view to searching for unique traits requiredfor climate change. Indigenous knowledge and farmers' wisdom has immense value.

Technical papers 179 Adopt resource-conserving technologies. Diversification of cropping. Better weather forecasting. Heat stress management Screening for heat tolerance and identification and development of heat tolerant genotypes Delayed sowing synchronizing the reproductive phase of the crop with occurrence of higher temperatures ( 35\u00baC) was proposed for screening chickpea genotypes for tolerance to heat (Gaur et al., 2007). A screening of 180 genotypes at Patancheru, and Kanpur India during 2007/08 revealed large genotypic variation with significant variations for heat tolerance index (HTI) inchickpeas (Krishnamurthy et al., 2011). The genotypes that showed high heat tolerance over best known heat tolerant line ICCV collaboration with its NARS partners of India have identifiedheat tolerant faba bean, chickpea and lentil genotypes. Similarly, testing in Sudan with full irrigationfacilities identified FLIP87-59C, also resistant to drought, as a heat-tolerant genotype. In lentils,ICARDA is targeting genotypes with rapid ground cover, early phenology, a prolonged floweringand podding period leading to increased dry matter production, more pods, high harvest index,efficient water use and large seeds to adapt to heat stress. Most of the progress in breeding for terminal heat escape has been made in development of short-duration varieties such as Precoz, Idleb 3, Bakaria, BARI M4, M5 and withoutcompromising yield level. In lentil, evaluation of germplasm under delayed planting with andwithout irrigation resulted in presumptive identification of genotypes tolerant to heat (ILL 3597,Sel and IG2507 were identified through delayedplanting that exposed the crop reproductive phase to high temperature >37\u00baC under irrigatedconditions. (Kumar et al., 2014). In chickpeas, development of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) is in progress at ICRISAT for mapping of quantitative loci (QTL) controlling heat tolerance. The phenotypic and genotypic data availableon the reference set are being used for association mapping (Thudi et al., 2014). In mungbeans, extra early maturing genotypes (IPM 205-7 and IPM 409-4), which mature in 46-48 days, have been developed at the Indian Institute of Pulses Research (Pratap et al . 2013). These genotypes when grown during summer will save two irrigation and one insecticide sprayand better suited to growing at high temperatures. A high degree of pollen sterility was observed in pigeon peas at temperatures exceeding 38\u00baC. Similarly frost and low temperature cause significant damage to the standing field crop of pigeonpeas. One hundred fifty minicore collections of pigeon peas, 85 medium and long duration linesand 35 early duration lines were tested at different hot spots (Ludhiana, Kanpur, Badnapur,Khargone and Gulbarga) under NICRA project of India. Phenotyping for high temperature toleranceTable 2. Some promising varieties of pulses tolerant to high temperature Crop Variety Duration (day) regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 180was developed based upon variable fluorescence and imaging. C Scaraboeides were identified which flowered and set pods at 40/20\u00baC max/min temp and low soil moisture. Therefore, combined tolerance such as foliar resistance based uponvariable fluorescence and reproductive tolerance, e.g. pollen viability and in-situ germinationproved essential criteria for selection. Wild accessions of Vigna are maintained in the gene bank of IIPR, India. Photo-insensitive and thermo-tolerant greengram genotypes setting max/min temperature and 11 and16 h daylength have were evaluated and characterized based on 37 morpho-physiological are useful for summer cultivationand ideal for intercropping in crops like sugarcane that can avoid terminal heat stress; due to earlyharvesting they can save 1-2 irrigations and also save 1 insecticide spray. Photoperiodic response, a high yield stabilizing factor or stress Pulses are considered to be highly sensitive to photothermoperiods. Sensitivity to photo- andthermoperiods is the major factor responsible for high genotype \u00d7 environment (G \u00d7 E) interaction, and yield instability of major pulses across different environments. Therefore,development of photo-and thermo-insensitive genotypes had been the primary requirement toaddress climate risk. The severity of these stresses is unpredictable in field experiments, somultilocation field trials are increasingly supplement ed with controlled-environment testing and physiological screening. Blackgrams, greengrams and pigeon peas are known to be thermo- andphotosensitive crops. They are grown in areas where day length varies from 11 to 14 h and largedifferences in temperature are experienced, largely due to variations in altitude and latitude. Field studies have been conducted in pigeonpeas with different maturity durations (extra-early, early, medium and long durations) in Kenya to determine the effect of photoperiod andtemperature on flowering. It has been f ound that the extra-short duration genotype 'ICPL 90011' was the least responsive to variation in photoperiod, while the two long-duration genotypes 'ICEAP00040' and 'T 7' In chickpeas , ICCV 960029 and as photothermoinsensitive. Generally, chickpea varieties originatedfrom south and central zones of India are relatively photothermoinsensitive contrary to thoseoriginated from the north. Sources of heat tolerance Sources of heat tolerance have been identified in some legumes by exposing the crop to hightemperatures at reproductive phase. Efforts are being made to understand mechanisms andgenetics of heat tolerance. The extensive screening of germplasm for heat tolerance acrosschickpea germplasm indicates large genetic variation in heat tolerance (Krishnamurthy et al., 2011) that can be used in the breeding programmes for development of heat tolerant varieties. Severalthermo-tolerant chickpea lines, e.g. ICC 1205, ICC 15614, ICC 8950 have also been identified. A heattolerant chickpea variety JG 14 has been released for late sown condition in India and Myanmar(Gaur et al., 2010, 2014). Improving reproductive stage tolerance through selection and short- duration varieties escaping terminal heat and drought should be the primary goal to developclimate resilient pulses. Under ICAR, India sponsored the programme National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA), ACIAR and DAC funded projects, a large number of pulse genotypes were identified basedVII. Technical papers 181upon multilocation trials and controlled environments showing tolerance to drought, heat, water- logging, frost and insensitive to photo-thermoperiods. For example, drought tolerant chickpeasidentified are RSG 888, 72, 850 (Basu et al., Jha al., and thermo-insensitive in wild Vigna species included V. glabrescens (IC 251372), V. umbellata (IC251442) (Pratap et al., 2014). Some wild accessions of pigeonpeas ( C. Scaraboeides) showed combined tolerance to drought and heat. Sources of drought resistance in pigeonpeas were explored in wild species C. Sericious, C. Scarabaeoides and C. Aquitifolius based on osmotic adjustment. Some of these wild sps showed very high osmotic adjustment (OA) up to 2.5 MPa. Out of fifty pigeonpea ICRISATevaluated at likewise, JKM7, JKM189 and ICP4575appeared better at Badnapur. Drought stress management in pulses Pulses, in general, consume very little water compared with cereals and vegetables. However, if heattolerant pulses are developed, the water r equirement of these genotype has been estimated to be about 5-6 times higher to attain the same amount of biomass as under normal temperature. Each1\u00baC increase in the average temperature will requir e 20-25 percent more water and nitrogen to meet the crop demand for water and nitrogen. A concept has emerged that suggests that elevatedCO 2 may improve water use efficiency (WUE) in grain legumes . Climate change-driven high carbon gain per unit availability of water enables faster dry matter accumulation, hence WUE of allcool-season pulses may dramatically increase. However, benefits of high WUE cannot be deriveddue to shortening of crop duration and adverse eff ects of high temperature that induces pollen sterility. Biomass has been found to be the most sensitive to water stress. Leaf expansion is affected even under mild water stress with a leaf water potential declined to 1.2 MPa. The biomass showed a linear relationship with yield under rainfed indicating source (leaves and stems) are the majorlimiting factor for low yield. Field screening for dr ought tolerance is largely based upon drought susceptibility index. The genotypes which showed low yield relative to its rainfed counterpart, hadhigher drought susceptibility index (DSI). The lower the DSI, the greater was the drought toleranceof the line. The line-source sprinkler technique was used to compare moisture responses of a rangeof chickpea lines grown on receding soil moisture which showed a linear response of both aerialbiomass and grain yield to moisture applied (Johansen et al ., 1994). Matching phenology and early biomass accumulation, dehydration postponement, root characteristics, osmotic adjustment, lethal leaf water potential, membrane stability, prolineaccumulation, water use efficiency are some of the potential traits identified for selecting droughttolerant lines in pulses. The phenology to the water supply with early biomass and setting ofreproductive organs before onset of terminal drought is largely considered a drought escapemechanism. In environments in which terminal drought is likely, selection for shorter time toflowering has been highly successful (Subbarao et al ., 1991). The postponement of drought by reducing water loss by reducing transpiration or by reduction in the stomatal density and an increase in the leaf reflectance through production of glandularProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 182hairs in chickpeas are considered to be adaptive traits through which leaves reduce water loss and intercepted non-photosynthetic radiation. Anatomical differences in pod wall imparts tolerance to drought in blackgrams. Waxy cuticle above the epidermis along with high density tall pod wall hairs prevent moisture loss and the pod wallremains photosynthetically active under drought. Pod wall photosynthesis is independent of plantwater status. A wide genetic variability among root characters such as density and depth, total root biomass has been reported in pulses. Kashiwagi et al ., (2005) have identified lines of chickpeas with increased drought tolerance through increased root biomass. The degree of osmotic adjustment (OA) has also been shown to be correlated with yield under dry land conditions in pulses. Osmotic adjustment (OA) has been shown to maintain stomatalconductance and photosynthesis at low leaf water potential, delay leaf senescence, reduce flowerabortion and improve root growth and water extraction from the soil (Basu et al., 2007). Intra and interspecies difference in osmotic adjustment and its range in grain legumes are given in Table 3.From the table it is clear that among pulses chickpeas, pigeonpeas and peanuts are tolerant todrought as compared to others. A significant genotypic variation in osmotic adjustment wasobserved in chickpeas (Basu et al., 2007) and pigeonpeas (Subbarao et al., 2000), greengram and blackgrams and this trait is being used for drought tolerance.

The lethal leaf water potential, i.e. the lowest water potential experienced by the last viable leaf, was a keymeasure of dehydration tolerance. this shows that soybeans have more dehydration tolerance thanothers.The ability of cells to continue metabolism at low leaf water status is termed dehydrationtolerance. Membrane disorder is often measured as leakage of solutes from the cell. Electrolyteleakage measured by conductivity meter has been used as a screening technique for heat anddehydration tolerance. Accumulation of proline in cell in response to water deficit is anothermechanism protecting protein structures as cell dehydrate, and as an organic nitrogen source. Significant genetic variation was observed in water use efficiency WUE among the chickpea genotypes. Kashiwagi et al., 2006) reported highly significant relationship between 13 C and transpiration efficiency (TE) in chickpeas. The method can be applied to large scale screening ofpulses for higher water-use efficiency with less time and more precisely. Indian chickpea cultivarse.g. RSG-143-1 and Vijay have been identified to have high water-use efficiency. WUE can beregarded as a very potential physiological trait for crop improvement. Chickpea lines ICC4958 andFLIP87-59C and faba bean line ILB938 have demonstrated good drought tolerance parameters indifferent experiments (Stoddard. et al ., 2006). Thus increased WUE may have tremendous impact on crop growth and grain yield under drought. Water use efficiency in terms of gaseous exchangeof plant is represented by the following formula. WUE = Photosynthesis/Transpiration = Photosynthesis/Stomatal conductanceThere is a clear relationship between the amount of water transpired and yield across a diverse range of crop species. Water and soil resource being limited, the only options for increasingbiomass production in pulse is to increase the water use efficiency (WUE) i.e. more biomass perunit of water. Passioura (1977) defined that grain yield is the simple function of transpiration, wateruse efficiency and harvest index (HI) Yield = Transpiration X WUE X HI: Where, WUE = Water-use efficiency; HI = Harvest index Improving drought tolerance in pulses Physiological traits imparting tolerance to drought form the basis of selection of drought tolerance in pulses. Pulses require very less water as compared to other crops, therefore pulses are welladapted to water-limiting environment. Extensive attempts had been made for the past severaldecades to improve drought tolerance in pulses for further minimizing water requirementunder rainfed situation. Drought tolerance rating or sensitivity of pulses are as follows: lathyrus> horsegrams>cowpeas>pigeonpeas>chickpeas>lentils>greengrams>blackgrams>fieldpeas>rajmash. Among pulses, drought tolerance levels are very high in pigeonpeas allowing the crop togrow more in dry situations as lethal leaf water potential is very high (Table 4).) The lethal waterpotential is defined as the water status of the leaf at the point where the plant cannot survive anylonger. Comparative studies showed that turgor loss in pulses occurs at much lower leaf waterpotential than wheat and potato indicating the high tolerance of pulses to drought. Two wild accessions of Vigna were identified as photo-thermo insensitive (Pratap et al., 2014). These include one accession each of V. glabrescens (IC 251372) and V. umbellata (IC 251442) based upon viable pollen and normal pollen tube formation, podding and seed set at high temp up to 44 oC and low temp. up to 4.4\u00baC. Distant Hybridization Programme for climate resilience in olerance genotype in blackgram PGRU 95016 has been identified which is characterized by flowering at both 10 and 16 h photoperiod; flowered atboth 25/15 and 36/20\u00baC max/min temp regimes and has the ability of pollen germination at 43\u00baC.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 184Based on multilocation evaluation at Vamban (Tamilnadu) and Durgapura (Rajasthan) havebeen confirmed to be tolerant to heat and drought. Based upon sucrose synthase activity and protein profiling, a few promising greengram lines were identified as heat tolerant which are presently under field trial across diverse agroclimatic zones. These genotypes are PDM 139(Samrat), IPM-02-1, PDM 288, IPM-05-3-21, ML-1257. Cold stress and frost tolerance For frost tolerance, an efficient controlled-envir onment procedure involves exposing hardened pot- grown plants to sub-zero temperatures. Faba beans Cote d'Or and BPL4628 as well as lentil ILL5865have demonstrated good freezing tolerance in such tests (Stoddard et al., 2006). Low temperature leads to conversion of intracellular water into ice and consequently shrinking of cells and wiltingand death and pod drop in peak winter comparedto other long duration pigeonpeas. Five germplasm lines exhibited less damage to frost in a lowlying areas. Visual observations on flowering and pod development indicated that IPAC234 andIPAC114 have better recovery. Chilling-tolerance tests are more commonly conducted in the field and lentil line ILL1878 as well as derivatives of interspecific crosses between chickpeas and its wild relatives have repeatedlyshown good results. The timing of chilling is particularly important as temperatures which are notlethal to the plant can greatly disrupt fertilization of flowers (Stoddard et al ., 2006). Tolerance to waterlogging Flooding situations may arise due to heavy rains in some of the areas under the present climate change scenario. Pulses are very sensitive to flooding. Water logging affects plant growth byreducing the oxygen diffusion rate between soil and atmosphere and by changing physical andchemical properties of the soil. Pigeonpeas [ Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] are a waterlogging-sensitiveTable genotypes/cultivars tolerant to abiotic Water-logging ICPL 84023 (early) Lenticel development, Sarode et al.

Water logging tolerance can be evaluated using paired hydroponic systems, one oxygenated and the other de-oxygenated. The development of lysigenous cavities or aerenchymain roots, common in warm-season legumes, is reported in peas and lentils but is not wellestablished in chickpeas or faba beans. (waterlogging significantly increased hydrogen peroxide accumulation andlipid peroxidation, which indicated the extent of oxidative injury posed by stress conditions.Enzyme activities of peroxidase pea roots as a consequenceof waterlogged conditions, and all the enzyme activities were significantly higher in waterloggedresistant line ICPL-84023 than in sensitive line MAL-18.

Salinity tolerance Haryana, Gujarat and some of the coastal belt of India are highly affected with salinity and theproblem will be further aggravated in the present climate scenario. Salinity response can bedetermined using hydroponic methods with a sand or gravel substrate and rapid, efficient scoringis based on leaf symptoms. Many lines of chickpeas, faba beans and lentils have shown goodsalinity tolerance. Karnal chana CSG 88101 has been identified salt-tolerant chickpea varietysuitable for moderate saline and alkaline areas (Dua, 1998). Soil salinity affects pigeon pea plantsthrough osmotic stress and interference with uptake of mineral nutrients. It has been suggestedthat development of greengram genotypes with drought and salinity tolerance, which can retainlarge number of flowers with productive pods during high temperature (>40\u00baC) are prerequisteto increase greengram production in India (Singh and Singh, 2011). Salt tolerance of Pigeonpeas(Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp) was assessed in local pigeonpea, ICPL-151 and ICPL-850014. The tolerant accession, ICPL-151 accumulated significantly lower shoot and root Na+and shoot Cl -. The better performance of ICPL-151 under saline conditions seems apparently due to accumulation of lessNa+ and more K+ and K/Na ratio and higher concentration of proline, free amino acids and solublesugars than the other two accessions (Waheed et al., 2006). Molecular characterization Molecular marker analysis was done in 58 genotypes of Vigna including 50 wild accessions and four standard check cultivars each of greengrams and blackgrams.These genotypes were subjectedto SSR screening using already reported 87 primer pairs from Phaseolus , adzuki bean, mungbean and urdbean background. Till now, 52 SSRs have been screened for diversity analysis in all 58accessions among which 40 were found polymorphic while 12 were found monomorphicPrebreeding was initiated on the basis of information generated (Pratap et al., unpublished). Drought specific genes, Dreb 1A, Dreb 1B and Osmotin are being used for developing drought tolerant chickpeas and pigeonpeas. Drought Specific signal molecules ABA and its role in droughttolerance have been characterized. Identification of linked QTL's for root and high yield (MAS)opened new hope in the field of drought research. Rapid advancements in genomics provide anopportunity for molecular mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling heat tolerance andusing marker-assisted breeding for development of heat tolerant varieties with suitable agronomicbackground and desired seed traits. Molecular markers will be soon available for major heattolerance QTL in some legumes which will further facilitate breeding for heat and droughttolerance.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 186Conclusion Pulses are largely drought tolerant crops and are well adapted to rainfed situations requiring little conserved soil moisture to sustain and produce reasonably good yields. However, inadequaterainfall under water-limited rainfed areas often threaten pulses, which leads to substantial loss ofgrain yield. The drought tolerance characters of pulses are well characterized and genotypicvariability of the drought tolerant morpho-physiological traits have been established. Root-basedtraits are being used to improve drought tolerance in major pulse crops. However, yield stabilityof pulses requires less genotype \u00d7 environment interaction and wider adaptability across the environment. The physiological trait such as water use efficiency is considered to be the mostimportant to contribute to grain yield and biomass under drought conditions. A large pool of pulsegermplasm is available which needs to be evaluated for drought tolerance and high water-useefficiency. Rapid screening for water-use efficiency in a large number of germplasm is now possible using the carbon isotope discrimination technique. In addition to physiological and breeding approaches toenhancing yield, efficient agronomic practices need to be evolved to minimize the irrigation waterand conserve soil moisture to increase the water productivity. Phenotypic plasticity, i.e. adjustingflowering time (daylength and temperature) is one of the best strategies for adaptation of pulsesin diverse climates. This needs to be properly exploited to develop many short-duration varieties.To improve pulse productivity in the present scenario, gene mining for tolerance to abiotic stresses,restructuring plant types for climatically vulnerable regions (Singh, 1997), changing croppingpatterns, efficient nutrient and water management, seed bank for alternate legume crops,watershed management, microirrigation facilities are some of the better options to address climatechange. Studies on physiological mechanisms and genetics of heat tolerance and identification ofmolecular markers and candidate genes for heat tolerance are in progress and would help indeveloping more efficient breeding strategies for heat tolerance in grain legumes. In thebackground of climate change, irrigated pulses are also affected adversely and yield loss isprojected. Chilling temperature, frost, water-logging and salinity are increasingly becoming hiddenthreats which need to be addressed immediately.VII.

Singh * Principal Scientist (Biochemistry) and Head, Division of Basic Sciences Indian Institute of Pulses Research, Kanpur-208 024, UP , India Abstract Pulses represent one of the most important food categories that have been extensively used as staple foods as well as part of healthy, balanced diet to meet basic protein and energyneeds. Pulses have a unique nutritional profile - low-fat source of digestible protein, (typicallycontaining about twice the amount of protein found in whole grain cereals like wheat, oats,barley and rice), dietary fibre (containing both soluble and insoluble fibres), complexcarbohydrates, resistant starch and low glycemic index and a number essential vitamins andminerals such as iron, potassium, magnesium, zinc and selenium. Pulse carbohydrates are slowly digested which allows some of the lowest Glycemic Index (GI) among carbohydrate-containing foods. Pulse GI typically ranges from about 29 to 48 (usingglucose as the standard). The relatively slow digestibility and hence low GI of pulses has beenattributed to several constituents, including carbohydrate composition, protein content andprotein-starch matrix, and antinutrient factors such including vitamin B9 (folate), thiamin and niacin. In addition to contributing toa healthy balanced diet, pulses contain a phenolic compounds which makethem helpful in the fight against some non-communicable diseases oftenassociated with diet transitions and rising incomes. Enzyme inhibitors can diminish protein digestibility, and lectins can reduce nutrient absorption, but both have little effect after cooking. Phytic acid can diminish mineral bioavailability. Somephenolic compounds can reduce protein digestibility and mineral bioavailability, andgalactooligosaccharides may cause flatulence. On the other hand, same compounds may haveprotective effects. Phytic acid exhibits antioxidant activity and protects against DNA damage,phenolic compounds have antioxidant and other important physiological and biologicalproperties, and galactooligosaccharides may elicit prebiotic activity. Encouraging awareness ofthe nutritional value of pulses can help consumers adopt healthier diets and also could be animportant dietary factor in improving longevity.Importance of pulses as a source of nutrition in Asian RegionProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 192Introduction Pulse crops represent an important component of agricultural food crops consumed in developing countries and are considered a vital crop for achieving food and nutritional security. They are idealcrops for reducing poverty, improving human health and nutrition, and enhancing ecosystemresilience. Globally, the harvested area under pulse crops is about one-tenth of the harvested areaunder all cereal crops and a high proportion of pulse area harvested is under rainfed-low inputsystems compared with cereal crops. Thus, in 2008, the average global yields of pulse crops(0.86 tonne/ha) was only about one-fourth of the average yields of cereal crops (3.54 tonnes/ha).On the bright side, over the past 14 years, the overall pulse production has increased at a ratehigher than the growth rate in population both in developing and developed countries. On thedemand side, over the past 14 years, a stable and modest positive trend in per capita consumptionis observed within the context of a declining overall historical trend. Dietary patterns are changingall over the world and the share of non-cereal foods in the total calorie and protein consumptionis increasing. However, at least over the past 14 years, pulses have not seen a dramatic decline inthe total calorie and protein contribution as seen by the cereal crops. In dietary terms, foodlegumes complement cereal crops as a source of protein and minerals, while agronomically theyserve as a rotation crop with cereals reducing soil pathogens and supplying nitrogen to the cerealcrop. Pulses are important food crops due to their high protein and essential amino acid content. Interest in the use of pulses for human nutrition has grown considerably in the last decade. Recentresearch has associated consumption of pulses with a decreased risk for a wide variety of chronicand degenerative diseases such as cancer, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The foodvalues of pulse seeds are high providing 336 to 354 Kcal of energy per 100 g, about the samecalorific value per unit weight as cereals. Their protein content is generally about double that ofmost cereals (Table 1). The seeds of pulse crops are typically made up of 20-25 percent proteincompared with 6-10 percent protein content in major cereal crops, however, they are a poorsource of sulphur-containing amino acids viz ., methionine and tryptophan, but they have high lysine content in which cereal proteins are deficient. Therefore, when they are used along withcereals, the proteins complement one another giving a better quality protein by supplying therespective limiting amino acids and improving the overall quality of protein in the diet. Table 1. Energy and protein content of major pulse and cereal crops Crop Scientific name Common name(Value/100 g) Maize Oryza sativa Rice, medium grain 360 6.61 Pennisetum glaucum Millet 378 11.02 Sorghum 352 9.91 Source: FAOVII. Technical papers 193Moreover, in recent years there has been a change in the consumption of pulses in several developed countries where they are increasingly considered as health foods (Ipsos Reid, 2010;USDA-ERS, 2011). On an average (unweighted by population) pulses contribute about 3 percentof total calories consumed in developing countries. Compared with cereal crops, this is relativelya small percentage from a global perspective. Because of their higher protein content, pulsescontribute relatively more towards total protein intake than calorie consumption. On an average(again, unweighted) pulse crops contribute 7.5 percent of total protein in developing countries asagainst 2.5 percent in developed countries. Pulses are a rich source of dietary fibre, complex carbohydrates, resistant starch and a bevy of vitamins and minerals, such as folate, selenium, potassium, Fe and Zinc. All pulses have a lowglycemic index (i.e., the carbohydrate is slowly digested) which has been shown to lower glucoseand insulin levels. For example, compared with white bread with a GI value of 100, the approximateGI values for chickpea are 40, lentil 42 and pea 45, while GI for beans can vary from 40 to 55. Theyare low in fat and contain no cholesterol. Pulses are a good source of folate which is useful in theprevention of diseases such as heart disease and cancer. The B vitamin folic acid significantlyreduces the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) like spina bifida in new born babies. Pulses containantioxidants - vitamin E, selenium, phenolic acids, phytic acids, copper, zinc and manganese. Pulsesalso other compounds like enzyme inhibitors, lectins, galacto-oligosaccharides and are anti-nutrient factors (ANF's) affect the digestibility and bioavailability of nutrients in humansand animals. Despite having many desirable traits in terms of nutrition and environmental benefits, in most countries of the world pulses are considered secondary crops. Globally, the harvested area underpulse crops is about one-tenth of the harvested area under all cereal crops. The area harvestedunder pulse crops increased at 0.4 percent per year since the mid-1990s, which compares positivelyto almost a stagnant global trend in area growth rate for cereals, but still not enough to changeits status from a secondary to a primary food crop. The data on calorie and protein consumption suggests that dietary patterns are changing globally and the share of non-cereal foods (i.e., vegetables, fruits, dairy and meat) in the total calorie andprotein consumption is rising. However, in contrast to cereals, pulses have not witnessed a dramaticdecline in the total calorie and protein contribution to an increasing quantity of food basketconsumed globally at least over the past 14 years but with the rapid economic growth in East Asiaand South Asia, the declining share of pulses in total protein intake observed in those two regionsmay be indicative of what is ahead for other regions as they experience rapid increase in per capitaincome. For cereals, the picture is more or less the same when it comes to its contribution to totalper capita protein intake. All the regions of the world have seen the share of cereals in per capitaprotein consumption decline over the last 14 years. In Asia total pulse consumption is expectedto grow 11.6 percent by 2020 and 23.6 percent by 2030. Per capita pulse consumption is expectedto decline slightly from an average 5.5 kg in late 2000s to 5.3 kg in future. Nutritive and anti-nutritive bioactive compounds in pulses: Implications for nutrition and health Protein Protein energy malnutrition affects every fourth child worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (2006). FAO estimates that 850 million people worldwide suffer from undernutrition, to which insufficient protein in the diet is a significant contributing factor. Seeds contain 17-35percent of protein on a dry weight basis. In terms of solubility in specific solvents, pulse proteinsProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 194fall primarily into the albumin (water-soluble) and globulin (salt-soluble) classes. The storage proteins legumin and vicillin are globulins, and the albumins comprise the heterogeneous groupof enzymes, amylase inhibitors, and lectins. In general, macronutrient studies have shown thatprotein is more than carbohydrates lipids (Weigle et al., 2005; Batterhan et al ., 2006). Moreover, the protein in pulses (Pai et al ., 2005) has been implicated in providing satiety. Sufian et al . (2007) found that pepsin-derived peptides from Dolichos lablab stimulated secretion of cholecystokinin, a gut hormone related to satiety. Thus, pulse proteins may contain bioactivecomponents that contribute to satiety and weight management when consumed. Most grains have a poor balance of essential amino acids. The cereals (maize, wheat, rice, etc.) tend to be low in lysine, whereas legumes are often low in the sulfur-rich amino acids methionine andtryptophan. Consumption of foods made from these crops potentially can help to preventmalnutrition in developing countries, especially among children. Diets comprising of High-Lys andHigh-Met cereals and legumes could allow diet formulations that reduce animal nitrogen excretionby providing an improved balance of essential amino acids. Carbohydrate The mono- and oligosaccharides represent only a small percent of total carbohydrate in pulses,whereas, starch is the most abundant carbohydrate. Starches account for 22-45 percent of pulsegrain weight depending on the source. As is typical of other grains, pulse starches are composedof amylose, a linear -1,4-linked glucan with few branches in the molecular weight range of 10 5-106, and amylopectin, a highly branched and much larger molecule (molecular weight 107-109) composed of -1,4-linked glycosyl units of varying lengths connected by -1,6 branch points. Pulse starches generally have a higher content of amylose compared with cereal and tuber starches; thisfactor plus their associated high capacity for retrogradation may reduce the starch digestion rate,rendering them either slowly digestible and/or resistant to digestion. Slowly digestible starch and resistant starch Slowly digestible starch is a term given to that fraction of starch that is not rapidly digested butdigests and absorbs slowly throughout the course of the small intestines. The term resistant starchapplies to the fraction that is not digested by the human -glucosidases, reaching the colon undigested with a general fate to be fermented by saccharolytic bacteria. Pulses have a unique profile raffinose, stachyose, verbascose, ajugose and pentosanspredominate in most of the The oligosaccharides of pulses are often considered a negativeattribute due to their high fermentability, with their associated rapid gas production anddiscomfort. Technically known as -galactosides, they are derived from sucrose and have 1-3 -1, 6-linked galactosyl units attached. They are commonly known as raffinose (1 galactosyl unit), stachyose (2 galactosyl units), and verbascose (3 galactosyl units). Fructans are an importantingredient in functional foods because evidence suggests that they promote a healthy colon(as a prebiotic agent) and help reduce the incidence of colon cancer. Fructans consisting of linear-(12)-linked fructose polymers are called inulins. sorbitol and mannitol. These low-digestible carbohydrates are poorly digested by human enzymesand fermented in the large intestine (Grabitske and Slavin, 2009). Fermentation of prebiotics andcertain low-digestible carbohydrates elicits a variety of health effects which can be subdivided intotwo main groups: functional effects and disease risk reduction. The functional effects arephysiological effects that can be measured relatively easily, including induction of satiety (Parnelland Reimer, 2012), reduction of caloric intake (Cani et al., 2009), and reduction of serum cholesterol,VII. Technical papers 195triglycerides, and glucose concentrations (Pereira and Gibson, 2002). Disease risk reduction, as implied by the name, is the compounding effect over time of one or more functional effects toreduce the risk/severity of chronic diseases. For example, prebiotic-induced satiety, reduced caloricintake, and improved serum lipid profile contribute to reducing the risk and severity of obesity andmetabolic syndrome (Delzenne, Neyrinck, and Cani, 2013). Pulse crops are effective at making bothpolymeric carbohydrates (e.g. starches and fructans) and individual sugars (e.g. sucrose andfructose). Dietary fibre Fibre is a group of substances chemically similar to carbohydrates, but non-ruminant animalsincluding humans poorly metabolize fibre for energy or other nutritional uses. Dietary fibre hasbeen recognized as a healthy food component (Walker, 1998). It consists of a mixture of polymericnon-starch substances, which resist enzymatic digestion in the human gastrointestinal tract. Mostof these substances are complex carbohydrates like cellulose, hemi-cellulose and pectin. Healthbenefits associated with adequate intake of these substances include: lower blood cholesterol andsugar levels, reduced risk of constipation, obesity, dieabetics, heart complications, colon and rectalcancer, gallstone, piles and hernia. Lignin, cellulose and some hemi cellulose typically constitutethe insoluble dietary fibre (IDF), hemi cellulose and other non-starch dietaryfiber polysaccharides make up the soluble dietary fiber (SDF). Legumes seeds typically containmore dietary fiber than cereals and are better sources of metabolically active SDF. In their raw state, pulses are high in fibre with 15-32 percent of total dietary fibre. Of this, approximately one-third to three-quarters is insoluble fibre and the remainder is soluble fibre.Insoluble fibre is associated with fecal bulking through its water-holding capacity, whereas solublefiber ferments, positively affecting colon health through production of SCFA, lowered pH, andpotential microbiota changes. Viscous soluble fibre (pectin and a few other non-starchpolysacchariedes) may increase gastric distention and help to slow gastric emptying rate (Howarthet al., 2001). The soluble fibre being a viscous liner along the walls of the intestine reduces glucose and cholesterol absorption into the blood stream (Anderson et al., 1984). This helps in reducing blood sugar and cholesterol levels which is most beneficial for diabetic and heart patients. Becauselegumes are a better source of soluble fibre than cereals, they are particularly recommended inthe diets of both diabetic and heart patients. Public health organizations recommended that adultsshould take 25 to 35 g dietary fibre per day. The dietary fibre content of grain legumes arepresented in Table 1. It is evident that the total dietary fibre (TDF) content of legume seeds variedfrom 11.5 to 33.2 percent. Chickpeas were the richest source of fibre followed by, pigeonpeas,green peas and lentils.

Vol. 23, No. 3, 2007.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 196Folic acid in pulses Folic acid also known as vitamin B9, or folacin and folate, as well as pteroyl-L-glutamic acid, pteroyl- L-glutamate, and pteroyl-monoglutamic acid is required to synthesize DNA, repair DNA, andmethylate DNA. It also helps in maturation of red blood cells and prevents anaemia. Folatedeficiency is a global problem affecting millions of people in both developed and developingcountries. Inadequate intake of folic acid during pregnancy increases the risks of pre-term delivery,low birth weight, fetal growth retardation, and developmental neural tube defects (NTDs). Inaddition, low folate intake and elevated homocysteine levels are associated with the occurrenceof neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and a range of cancers, while adequateintake of both folates and folic acid in diets decreases total homocysteine levels plasma.Tetrahydrofolate and derivatives, collec tively called folates, are water-soluble B vitamins. Humans and animals cannot synthesize folates, and therefore they must be supplied from plant-based andanimal foods including liver and eggs. Most staple food crops, including cereals, potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.) and banana ( Musa sp) are poor sources of dietary folates, and diets based on these foods often do not reach the folate RDAof 400 g/day. Generally, leafy vegetables contain more folates than roots and fruits. The USDA nutrient database shows that lentils ( Lens culinaris L.) and common beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are two pulses that are rich in folates. Although pulses are very good sources of folates, they arenot readily available due to complex binding with bio-molecules (Neilson, 1994). Chickpeas havea higher content of folate Folate content raw chickpeas was 149.7 g/100 g and 101.5 g/100 g in peas. In boiled chickpeas and peas the corresponding figures were 78.8 g/ 100 g and 45.7 g/100 g, indicating that some folate may have leached in the water used for processing. In addition to the above nutritive compounds, pulse seeds contain a large number of compounds which qualify as phytochemicals with significant potential benefits to human health (for example,as anticarcinogenic, hypocholesterolemic or hypoglycemic agents). Antinutritional compounds varyconsiderably in methods for their extraction, determination and quantification are specific for each compound. They do notappear equally distributed in all pulses, and their physiological effects are diverse. Some of thesecompounds are important in plant defence mechanisms against predators or environmentalconditions. Others are reserve compounds, accumulated in seeds as energy stores in readiness forgermination. Processing generally improves the nutrient profile of legume seed by increasing in vitro digestibility of proteins and carbohydrates and at the same time there are reductions in someantinutritional compounds. Most antinutritional factors are heat-labile, such as protease inhibitorsand lectins, so thermal treatment would remove any potential negative effects from consumption.On the other hand, tannins, saponins and phytic acid are heat stable but can be reduced bydehulling, soaking, germination and/or fermentation. However, in order to exert an effect, eitherlocal or systemic, these substances have to survive at least to some extent the digestive processwithin the gastrointestinal tract. The scientific interest in non-nutritional factors is now also turningto studies of their possible useful and beneficial applications as gut, metabolic and hormonalregulators and as probiotic/prebiotic agents. In this new era of intense bioactive research, the same ANF's are undergoing a reappraisal. Many of these non-nutritive bioactive components have been found to have positive health effectsassociated with their consumption. Phytic acid exhibits antioxidant activity and protects DNA fromVII. Technical papers 197damage, phenolic compounds have antioxidant and other important physiological and biological properties, saponins have a hypocholesterolaemic effect and anti-cancer activity. Pulses are gluten-free - they offer a great variety for those on a gluten-free diet (e.g. for Celiac disease, a gastro-intestinal disorder). The on-going research is examining how whole pulses and the individualcomponents offer protective and therapeutic effects to such chronic health conditions such asobesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer and how consumption of legumes couldpotentially help people live longer. Phenolic acids The major polyphenolic compounds of pulses consist mainly of tannins, phenolic acids andflavonoids. The seed color of pulses is mainly due to the presence of polyphenolic compounds viz.,flavonoids such as flavonol glycosides, (proanthocyanidins).The with the polyphenolic content are dark, varieties, such been quantified in the hulls of several varieties of field beans ( Vicia faba ) and are also present in pea seeds of colored-flower cultivars. Lentils have the highest phenolic,flavonoid and condensed tannin content (6.56 mg gallic acid equivalents g -1, 1.30 and 5.97 mg catechin equivalents g-1, respectively), followed by red kidney and black beans (Xu and Chang, 2007). The seed coat in lentils is very rich in catechins, procyanidins dimers and trimers. It wasreported that the (+) catechin-3glucose, with lesser amounts of(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (Duenas et al., 2003). Until recently, phenolic compounds were regarded as non-nutritive compounds and it was reported that excessive content of polyphenols,in particular tannins, may have adverse consequences because it inhibits the bioavailability of iron(South and Miller, 1998) and thiamine (Wang and Kies, 1991) and blocks digestive enzymes in thegastrointestinal tract (Shahidi and Naczk, 2004). Phenolic compounds can also limit thebioavailability of proteins with which they form insoluble complexes in the gastrointestinal tract.Later the significance of phenolic compounds was gradually recognized and several researcheshave now reported that phenolics offer many health benefits and are vital in human nutrition(Scalbert, et al., 2005). Pulses with the highest total phenolic content (lentils, red kidney, and blackbeans) exert the highest antioxidant capacity assessed by 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl(DPPH) free radical scavenging, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and oxygen radicalabsorbance capacity (ORAC) (Xu and Chang 2007). Chickpeas contain a wide range of polyphenolic compounds, including flavonols, glycosides, content inchickpeas range from 0.92 to 1.68 mg gallic acid equivalents g -1 (Xu and Chang 2007). Xu and Chang (2010), investigated the chemical and cellular antioxidant activities and phenolic profiles of11 lentil cultivars and found that five phenolic acids of the benzoic types and their derivates (gallic,protocatechuic, 2, 3, 4-trihydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and protocatechualdehyde) cinnamic type (chlorogenic, p-coumaric, m-coumaric, and acid) as one acid was thepredominant phenolic acid, and (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were the predominant flavonoids.Tsopmo and Muir (2010), studied the chemical profile of lentil ( Lens culinaris Medik.) cultivars. Extracts (100% methanol - water (1:1) were analyzed by RP-HPLC. Chromatographicseparations of the methanol extract afforded several compounds including the novel 4-chloro-1 H- indole-3- N-methylacetamide as well of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 198Antioxidant activity in pulses In the past few years, the antioxidant properties of food have been extensively studied since excessive production of free radicals/reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation arewidely believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of diseases such as cardiovascular diseases,cancers, autoimmune disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, various respiratory diseases, cataract,Parkinson's, or Alzhemier's diseases, and also ageing. Beninger and quercetin glycosides and protoanthocyanidins(condensed tanins), present in the seed coat methanol extract and tannin fractions from10 coloured genotypes of common beans Phaseolus vulgaris , displayed antioxidant activity, while the highest activity was obtained with extracts rich in condensed tannins. The Total antioxidantcapacity (TAC) value for chickpeas was reported as 10.7\u00b11.3 mmol Trolox/kg (A\u00e7ar \u00d6zge et al., 2009). Lentils showed a high total antioxidant capacity (TAC) value probably related to the highcontent of condensed tannins present in lentils (Duenas et al., 2003). Xu and Chang (2010), reported that caffeic acid, catechin, epicatechin, and total al. (2009) evaluated the antioxidant activity of pulses, commonly consumed in India and assessed the relationship withtheir total phenolic content. The total phenolic content (TPC) in pulses ranged 62.35 to 418.34mg/100 the least g). The antioxidant activity as determined by threedifferent methods showed a wide range of values. DPPH radical scavenging activity (1.07 TE/g),FRAP (373 mol/g) and reducing power (4.89 mg/g), all three were highest in Rajmash. Sreeramuluet al. (2009), further showed that in pulses the total phenolic content (TPC) was poorly correlated with antioxidant activity (AOA), suggesting thereby that only TPC might not contribute significantlyto the antioxidant activity in pulses. Isoflavones Flavones and isoflavones have been isolated from a wide variety of plants, though the isoflavonesare largely reported from the Fabaceae/Leguminosae family. According to the USDA survey onisoflavone content, lentils do not contain significant amounts of these isoflavones (USDA, 2002).Chickpeas contain daidzein, genistein, and formononetin (0.04, 0.06, and 0.14 mg 100 g -1, respectively), and approximately 1.7 mg 100 g-1 biochanin A. Soybeans have significantly higher levels of daidzein and genistein (47 and 74 mg 100 g-1, respectively) but contain less formononetin and biochanin A compared to chickpeas. There are many biological activities associated with theisoflavones, including a reduction in osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, prevention of cancer andfor the treatment of menopause symptoms (Cassidy et al ., 2006). Enzyme inhibitors Protein inhibitors of hydrolases present in pulses ar e active against proteases, amylases, lipases, glycosidases, and phosphatases. From the nutritional aspect, the inhibitors of the serine proteasestrypsin and chymotrypsin found in plant foodstuffs are the most important (Belitz and Weder,1990). Beans are the second largest group of seeds after cereals reported as natural sources of-amylase inhibitors (Lajolo et al., 1991). Protease inhibitors isolated from pulses are generally classified into two families, referred to as Kunitz and Bowman-Birk on the basis of their molecularweights and cystine contents. Kunitz type inhibitors have a molecular mass of ~20 kDa, with twodisulfide bridges, and act specifically against trypsin. Bowman-Birk type inhibitors with a molecular mass of 8-10 kDa, have seven disulfide bridges, and inhibit trypsin and chymotrypsin simultaneously at independent binding sites. High inhibitoractivity is found in soybean seeds which are usually reduced by processing. Bur null mutants forVII. Technical papers 199both Bowman-Birk and Kunitz have been identified in soybeans, allowing very low trypsin inhibitor cultivars to be developed. In common beans, lima beans, cowpeas, and lentils, protease inhibitorshave been characterized as members of the Bowman-Birk family (Belitz and Weder 1990; Lajolo et al., 1991). In peas large genetic variability is available for the activity of Bowman-Birk trypsin/ chymotrypsin inhibitor proteins (Table 2). Protease inhibitor content is moderate in kidney beans and cowpeas (8 and 10.6 g of trypsin and 9.2 g of chymotrypsin inhibited kg -1, respectively) (Grant et al., 1995). The content of -amylase inhibitors differs greatly among legumes, with the highest amount found in dry beans. Table 3. Range of variation for trypsin inhibitor activity in grain legume seeds Sl.

Lentils 1-9-2.8 Wang et al ., 2009 3-8 Guillamon et al ., 2008 lines) and Jambunathan, (Kabuli 15-19 Guillamon Lectins are proteins or glycoproteins that agglutinate erythrocytes of some or all blood groups in vitro and depend on their specificity and high binding affinity for a particular carbohydrate moiety on the cell surface (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2002). Lectins can reduce the digestibility and biological value of dietary proteins and inhibit the growth of experimental animals (Grant et al., 2000). These antinutritional effects are most likely caused by some lectins that can impair the integrity of theintestinal epithelium (Reynoso-Camacho et al., 2003) and thus alter the absorption and utilization of nutrients (Radberg et al ., 2001). The administration of lectins to experimental animals can also alter the bacterial flora (Pusztai, 1996). Lectin is one of the major proteins found in lentils(Lens culinaris ). Studies have suggested that lectins affect the immune response against ovalbumin and may promote the development of food allergies to plants containing lectins. Cookingeffectively removes trypsin inhibitor and lectin from vegetable peas significantly reducesprotein and amino acid solubility (Habiba, 2002). Lectin can be completely removed from lentilflour after 72 h fermentation at 42\u00baC with a flour concentration of 79 g L -1 (Cuadrado, et al., 2002). Amount of lectin in pulses vary significantly (Zhang et al ., 2009). High levels of lectins have been reported in kidney beans (840 \u00d7 10-5 hemagglutinating activity units (HU) kg-1) and very low amounts in cowpeas (3 \u00d710-5HU kg-1). Lectin accounts for about 2.4-5 percent of the total protein (17-23 percent) in kidney bean seeds, 0.8 percent in soybean and lima bean protein (34 percentand 21 percent, respectively), and around 0.6 percent of the total protein (24-25 percent) in gardenpeas. Dietary lectins have generally been considered toxic, and having an anti-nutritional factor. However, many lectins are non-toxic, such as those from lentils, peas, chickpeas and faba beans. Vicia faba agglutinin (VFA), in broad beans, aggregated, stimulated the morphologicaldifferentiation, and reduced the malignant phenotype of colon cancer cells (Jordinson et al., 1999). Inclusion of raw kidney beans in the diet of obese rats reduced lipid accumulation that was relatedto a decrease of insulin level caused by lectins. However, no body or muscle protein lossesoccurred, even at high doses, as with normal rats, suggesting a possible use of lectins astherapeutic agents to treat obesity (Pusztai, 1998). Lectin from kidney bean seeds directly inhibitsProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 200HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, an enzyme crucial for HIV replication, as well as -glucosidase, which has a role in HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 processing, therefore a very potent element of antiretroviral chemotherapy. Phytosterols In pulses, phytosterols are present in small quantities, and the most common phytosterols are-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol (Benveniste, 1986). These sterol glucosides and esterified sterol glucosides, with the glycolipids in defatted chickpea flour (Sanchez-Vioque et al., 1998). Total phytosterol content detected in the legumes ranged from 134 mg 100 g -1 (kidney beans) to 242 mg 100 g-1 in peas (Weihrauch and Gardner, 1978). Total -sitosterol content ranged from 160 mg 100 g-1 (chickpeas) to 85 mg 100 g-1 (butter beans). Chickpeas and peas contained high levels of campesterol (21.4 and 25.0 mg 100 g-1, respectively). Stigmasterol content is higher in butter beans (86 mg 100 g-1) and squalene content in peas (1.0 mg 100 g-1). Weihrauch and Gardner (1978) reported 127 mg 100 g-1 phytosterol level for kidney beans, with much lower concentration of phytosterols in chickpeas (35 mg 100 g-1). The consumption of pulse grains has been reported to lower serum cholesterol and increase thesaturation levels of cholesterol in the bile. A dietary study conducted by Duane (1997), on humansover a seven week period showed that serum LDL cholesterol was significantly lower during theconsumption of a diet consisting of beans, lentils and field peas. The study showed thatconsumption of pulses lowers LDL cholesterol by partially interrupting the entrohepatic circulationof the bile acids and increasing the cholesterol saturation by increasing the hepatic secretion ofcholesterol. The study concluded that other pulse components in the diet may also havecontributed to the observed effect; in particular, saponins, which are hydrolyzed by intestinalbacteria to diosgenin, may have exerted a positive effect (Fenwick and Oakenfull, 1983). Severalstudies have demonstrated the efficacy of plant sterols and stanols in the reduction of bloodcholesterol levels, and plant sterols are increasingly being incorporated into foods for this purpose(Gylling and Miettinen, 2005). Phytic acid Phytic acid (myo-inositol hexaphosphate or InsP6), a major phosphorus storage form in plants, and its salts known as phytates regulate various cellular functions such as DNA repair, chromatinremodeling, endocytosis, nuclear messenger RNA export and potentially hormone signalingimportant for plant and seed development (Zhou and Erdman, 1995), as well as animal and humannutrition (Vucenik and Shamsuddin, 2006). It is often regarded as an antinutrient because of strongmineral, protein and starch binding properties thereby decreasing their bioavailability (Weaver andKannan, 2002). Phytate plays an important role in plant metabolism, stress and pathogen resistancein addition to their beneficial effects in human diets by acting as anticarcinogens or by promotinghealth in other ways such as by decreasing the risk of heart disease or diabetes (Welch andGraham, 2004). Wholegrain cereals and pulses have a high content of phytate (Sandberg, 2002). Inpulse seeds, phytate is located in the protein bodies in the endosperm. Phytate occurs as a mineralcomplex, which is insoluble at the physiological pH of the intestine (Fredlund et al., 2006). Raw lentils contained 0.3 mmol kg -1 of InsP3. The most abundant inositol phosphate in raw, dry legumes is InsP6, accounting for an average of 83 percent of the total inositol phosphates, ranging from 77 percent in chickpeas to 88 percent in blackbeans. The InsP6 concentration tends to be higher in raw dry beans, blackeye peas, and pigeon peas than in lentils, green and yellow split peas, andchickpeas and ranged between 14.2 and 6 mmol kg -1 in blackbeans and chickpeas, respectively (Morris and Hill, 1996). Varietal and agronomic factors, alone and in combination, often result ina wide variation in phytate content of mature legume seeds and cereal grains (Dintzis et al ., 1992) (Table 3).VII. Technical papers 201In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that inositol hexaphosphate (InsP6, phytic acid) exhibits significant anticancer (preventive as well as therapeutic) properties. It reduces cellproliferation and increases differentiation of malignant cells with possible reversion to the normalphenotype and is involved in host defense mechanism, and tumor abrogation (Shamsuddin, 2002).InsP 6 has been suggested to be responsible for the epidemiological link between high-fibre diets (rich in InsP6) and low incidence of some cancers. Phytic acid delays postprandial glucose absorption, reduces the bioavailability of toxic heavy metal such as cadmium and lead, and exhibitsantioxidant activity by chelating iron and copper (Minihane and Rimbach, 2002). Dietary and endogenous phytic acid have protective effects against cancer and heart disease and may be responsible for the cancer-protective effects of high-fibre foods (Grases et al ., 2001). The anticarcinogenic properties of phytic acid may result from numerous factors, including its abilityto chelate metal ions; this depends on the phytate retaining its integrity in the colon (Steer andGibson, 2002). The backbone of most inositol phosphates in cells is myo-inositol. Inositol phosphates from seeds are a significant food source of myo-inositol, as are the phospholipids and free inositol from many plant- and animal-based foods (Berdanier, 1992). Myo-inositol has been evaluated for its ability to improve the mental health of patients with various psychiatric disorders(Einat and Belmaker, 2001). In addition to myo-inositol, smaller amounts of epi- and scyllo-inositol are present in human brains. Myo-inositol and InsP 6 have synergistic or additive effects in inhibiting the development of cancer (Shamsuddin, 1999). In mice, dietary myo inositol has been shown to be effective in preventing cancer of the lung (Wattenberg et al ., 2000), fore stomach (Estensen and Wattenberg, 1993), liver (Nishino et al., 1999) colon, mammary gland, prostate, and skin (Jenab and Thompson, 1998).

Their biological activity is closely related to chemicalstructures that determine the polarity, hydrophobicity and acidity of compounds. Saponins havelong been considered undesirable due to toxicity and their haemolytic activity. Although thetoxicological properties of plant saponins have long been recognized, there is renewed interest inthese biologically active plant components because recent evidence suggests that saponinspossess hypocholesterolemic (Oakenfull and Sidhu, 1990), anti-carcinogenic (Tokuda et al ., 1991) and immune-stimulatory properties (Wu et al., 1990). There is enormous structural diversity within this chemical class, and only a few are toxic (Shi et al., 2004). Most of the saponins occur asProceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 202insoluble complexes with 3- b-hydroxysteroids; these complexes interact with bile acid and cholesterol, forming large mixed micelles (Oakenfull and Sidhu, 1989). In addition, they forminsoluble saponin-mineral complexes with iron, zinc, and calcium (Milgate and Roberts, 1995),hence saponins lower nutrient availability (West and Greger, 1978). The most widely studied saponins in legumes include the soya saponins, which are classified into group A, B, and E saponins on the basis of the chemical structure of the aglycone (Rochfort andPanozzo, 2007). Field peas were initially thought to contain soyasaponin I (S-I) (and thensoyasaponin VI (S-VI) as the only soyasaponin, but recently field pea extracts were shown tocontain dehydrosoyasaponin I (D-I) as a minor component (Taylor and Richards, 2008). D-I frompeas has insecticidal and anti-feedant properties against stored product insect pests. Thistriterpenoid saponin dehydrosoyasaponin I is a natural product present in chickpeas and otherlegumes and is known to be a potent calcium-activated potassium channel opener and as suchcan be used for treating cardiovascular, urological, respiratory, neurological, and other disorders.Soybeans and chickpeas constitute major sources of saponins in the human diet (Oakenfull, 1981). Saponins have been reported in many pulses, lentils (Ruiz et al., 1996), and chickpeas (El-Adawy, 2002), as well as in various beans, and peas (Shi et al., 2004). Saponin content may vary even among the same species of edible beans, because of variations in cultivars, varieties (Khokhar andChauhan, 1986), locations, irrigation condition, type of soil, climatic conditions, and the year duringwhich they are grown. Chickpeas, blackgrams, moth beans, broad beans and peas can contain 3.6,2.3, 3.4, 3.7, and 2.5 g kg -1 dry matter of saponins, respectively (Khokhar and Chauhan, 1986). Saponin content in dehulled light and dark colored peas ranges from 1.2 to 2.3 g kg-1 dry matter (Daveby et al., 1998). The saponin content varies from 0.3 to 1.1 g/kg in peas (Table 4). Some saponin is lost during processing as has been reported in moth beans (Khokhar and Chauhan,1986), blackgrams (Kataria et al., 1989) and pigeonpeas (Duhan et al., 2001). Recent evidence suggests that legume saponins may possess anti-cancer properties (Xu and Chang (2007) and be beneficial for hyperlipidemia (Shi et al., 2004). In addition, they reduce the risk of heart diseases in humans consuming a diet rich in food legumes containing saponins (Geiland Anderson, 1994). Epidemiological studies suggest that saponins may play a role in protectionfrom cancer (Shi et al., 2004). Metastatic events are critical in cancer proliferation, and there is evidence that glycosylation is an important event in this process. Aubert et al. (2000) and Xu and Chang (2007) have recently demonstrated that soyasaponin I decreases the expression of R-2,3-linked sialic acid on the cell surface, which in turn suppresses the metastatic potential ofmelanoma cells. The observed anticancer activity may therefore in part be due to this observedsialyltransferase inhibition activity. Additional mechanistic studies indicate that there is evidencefor saponin regulation of the apoptosis pathway enzymes (AKT, Bcl, and ERK1/2), leading toprogrammed cell death of cancer cells (Godlewski et al., 2006). Research on colon cancer cells suggests that it is the lipophilic saponin cores that may be responsible for the biological activity. Table 5. Range of variation for saponin in major pulses Sl.

Annex CLOSING REMARKS by Hiroyuki Konuma Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Asia and the Pacific delivered at the Regional Consultation on promotion of pulses for the multiple benefits in Asia Bangkok, Thailand 30 June 2015 It is once again my utmost pleasure to be able to be here amongst all of you at the closing ceremony of the Regional Consultation on promotion of pulses for the multiple benefits in Asia . To begin with, I would like to express my sincere thanks to everyone for their hard work, commitment and dedication during the last two days. My heartfelt gratitude goes to ProfessorSwaminatan for his kind presence and guidance in order to help this regional consultation achieveits objectives. The presence of ICARDA, ICRISAT, and all reputed experts working in this field has,furthermore, enhanced the technical values of this event. During the last two days, we have discussed and tried to touch upon almost all relevant and pressing issues that the pulse development sector in this region is facing. With everyone'scontribution, we attempted to find ways and means on how to move forward to bring back theglorious past of this group of crops in order to improve not only food and nutrition security of themillions of families dependent on this sector but also increase their employment and incomes inaddition to improving soil fertility. My understanding is, this forum discussed in details how to fit pulses in farmers' cropping patterns in line with the recent development in the field of climate change, natural disasters and rapidchanges in the cropping patterns. I was told that the consultation has achieved its objectives and quite a good number of recommendations came up. Appropriate implementation of these recommendations willundoubtedly help in enhancing productivity in this sector. Dear All, It is the responsibility of the country to make efforts to implement these recommendations. Inorder for this to happen, our first task will be to bring changes in the country's policies andstrategies that would ensure that pulses are included as focused crops, and allocate sufficientresources to facilitate the implementation of these policies and strategies. I firmly believe that until and unless we are able to bring a breakthrough in this sector, poor people's food and nutrition security will still be at stake. This sector should receive a renewed thrustfrom all of us which is also why the coming year has been declared as the year of pulses, so as todirect attention towards the pulse sector and to help everyone realise the benefits that can bederived from simple interventions to increase productivity in this area.Proceedings of the regional consultation on the promotion of pulses in Asia for multiple health benefits 208With the year 2016 being the \"International Year of Pulses\" , these recommendations have come in very timely and will help in developing relevant and appropriate programmes to boost productionof pulses. FAO would be happy to provide support if member countries require it. FAO is alsocommitted to working with the CGIAR institutes to take forward the momentum created throughthis regional consultation. To conclude, I would like to inform you that FAO will give high priority and considerations required to further highlight these recommendations and to provide the thrust, when opportunity comes.We will provide all our support, if and whenever necessary, to implement these recommendationsboth at country and regional levels. With this, I thank you all again for your kind contributions and wish you a safe return to your home countries. We are hopeful that there will be more opportunities to meet you all in otherprogrammes when the whole world joins hands to celebrate the International Year of Pulses in2016. "}
