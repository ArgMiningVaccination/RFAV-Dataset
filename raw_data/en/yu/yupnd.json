The far-reaching impact of COVID - 19 continued to put extraordinary pressure on both healthcare systems and our routine GERMS-SA surveillance. Having experienced four waves by 2021 resources had to be shifted towards COVID-19-related activities. With easing of lockdown regulations, introduction of COVID-19 vaccination program and decline in COVID-19 cases, diagnosis rates of other infectious diseases increased, also the number of isolates received by NICD reference laboratories showed an increase as well as better quality isolate viability. Pressure in many clinical laboratories remained and impacted the rates of audit cases which are still out of target range. Therefore, we were unable to do antimicrobial susceptibility testing and serotyping/serogrouping on these missing isolates. The fire at CMJAH, deferment of patients to other hospitals and the NHLS laboratory being closed for a few months also impacted our statistics. We urge all microbiology laboratories, in their challenged capacities, to continue to participate in laboratory surveillance so monitoring can continue and relevant, evidence-based policies can be made. The 2021 review also includes other NICD projects using the GERMS-SA platform; rotavirus/diarrhoeal aetiological surveillance. This project differs from the laboratory-based surveillance in that it is syndromic surveillance and specimens are taken from patients with diarrhoea. We encourage all laboratory staff to continue participating in the NICD surveillance programmes. We thank you for your ongoing service to the health of all South Africans. In 2021, diseases under surveillance included: 1. Opportunistic infections associated with HIV, e.g. cryptococcosis, invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and rifampicin-susceptible pneumoniae Streptococcus bloodstream infections caused Carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus species. The methods utilised by the GERMS-SA surveillance programme have been previously described in detail (1). In brief, approximately 222 South African clinical microbiology laboratories participated in the surveillance programme in 2021. The estimated population under surveillance in 2021 was at 60,1 million (Table 1). Diagnostic laboratories reported case patients to the NICD using laboratory case report forms, according to standard case definitions. If available, isolates from case patients were submitted on Dorset transport media to the NICD for further phenotypic and genotypic characterisation. From 1 July 2008 to 31 December 2013, surveillance methodology for the cryptococcal project was changed, so that only enhanced surveillance sites (ESS) (26 hospitals in 9 provinces), NHLS laboratories in KZN, and laboratories in the private, mining, and military sectors were required to directly report case patients to NICD. In 2015 and 2016 to 31 July 2022, no laboratories were required to directly report case patients or send isolates to NICD. For these cases of cryptococcosis, data were obtained directly from the NHLS Surveillance Data Warehouse (SDW), which stores information from Disa*Lab and TrakCare laboratory information systems. Cryptococcal isolates, obtained from patients at enhanced surveillance sites, continued to be characterised by phenotypic and genotypic tests through 2013. The Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance program used the GERMS-SA platform since 2011 to 31 December 2021 as Laboratory-based Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (LARS) for nosocomial bacteria in four provinces and these organisms were requested was initiated only for 2021, together with CRE there was no ESS but phenotypic and genotypic testing on obtained isolates. Enhanced surveillance was not conducted on any of the enteric pathogens in 2015 but restarted for Salmonella Typhi only in 2016 as well as Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi A, METHODSINTRODUCTION NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES ANNUAL SURVEILLANCE REVIEW 20218 Site visits In 2021, NICD staff members continued with surveillance training at enhanced surveillance sites and laboratories. Other site visits were reduced due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. Coordination of meetings GERMS-SA Surveillance Officers'/ Research Assistants' online (Zoom) training 12, 19 and 26 July 2021: The aim was to refresh, update and train on current GERMS-SA surveillance projects, including sentinel diarrhoeal disease surveillance and sentinel syndromic respiratory surveillance projects. New projects were introduced and challenges with electronic data collection were addressed.Online Surveillance Review meeting previously known as the GERMS-SA Principal Investigators' meeting, 23-24 June 2021: the aim was to feedback on surveillance programme's results and reassess surveillance impact. Surveillance audit A total of 11 633 surveillance cases were detected by GERMS-SA in 2021 (about two-thirds of the previous year's total). Excluding the cases of cryptococcosis (n=5 004) which are all detected by audit, 1 649/6 629 (25%) of cases were detected by audit of the NHLS Corporate Data Warehouse (Table 2) and isolates not sent to the NICD by the clinical microbiology laboratories. GERMS-SA constantly strives to reduce the number of cases detected on audit by raising awareness of the surveillance programme; this is important because GERMS-SA is unable to perform addi tional microbiological characterisation of isolates detected only HIV-infected population** 2020 2021 2020 2021 Eastern Cape 6 734 001 6 676 590 812 694 821 514 Free State 2 928 903 2 932 441 3 76 154 377 899 Gauteng 15 488 137 15 810 388 1 939 019 1 966 032 KwaZulu-Natal 11 531 628 11 513 575 2 027 027 2 040 577 Limpopo 5 852 553 5 926 724 473 701 479 493 Mpumalanga 4 679 786 4 743 584 724 469 736 414 Northern Cape 1 292 786 1 303 047 83 448 84 248 North West 4 108 816 4 122 854 493 037493 037 497 375497 375 Western Cape 7 005 741 7 113 776 469 776 478 860 South Africa 59 622 350 60 142 978 7 399 323 7 482 413 Data source: *Statistics South Africa, **Thembisa Model OPERATIONAL REPORTB and C and Nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. in 2019. At ESS, for 2021, surveillance officers completed clinical case report forms electronically using the REDCap database on tablets, for patients with any of eight laboratory-confirmed diseases: cryptococcosis, invasive pneumococcal rifampicin-susceptible TB (in five provinces). Surveillance officers collect data by case patient interview or hospital medical record review, to obtain additional clinical details, including antimicrobial use, vaccination history, HIV status, and patient outcome. Case patients were followed up only for the duration of the hospital admission. Data management was centralised at the NICD. Laboratory, clinical and demographic data from case patients were recorded on a Microsoft Access database. A surveillance audit was performed for NHLS laboratories in all provinces using the NHLS CDW. For all diseases under surveillance, except cryptococcosis and rifampicin-susceptible TB, the audit was designed to obtain basic demographic and laboratory data from additional case patients with laboratory-confirmed disease not already reported to GERMS-SA by participating laboratories. Data from case patients, detected by audit, were included on the surveillance database, and have been included in this report. Incidence was calculated using mid-year population estimates for 2020 and 2021 from Statistics South Africa (Table 1) (2). Incidence in the HIV-infected and AIDS populations was calculated for 2020 and 2021, using the Thembisa model (Table 1) (3). All reported incidence is expressed as cases per 100 000 population, unless otherwise stated. Reported p-values were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test and p-values <0.05 were considered significant throughout. Ethics approval for the ongoing activities of the surveillance programme was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee (Medical), University of Witwatersrand and from relevant University and Provincial Ethics Committees for other enhanced surveillance sites. Surveillance activities were funded by the NICD/NHLS. Table 1.

Enhanced surveillance site performance indicators The proportion of completed CRFs remained the same as in 2020. As adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions decreased and lockdown lowered, surveillance officers resumed face-to-face interviews with patients. A challenge of poor record systems in many hospitals was still an issue 2 417/ 3 386 (71%) of cases had a case report form (CRF) completed (target=90%) (Table 3). Since 2007, enhanced surveillance site operational reports (ESSOR) have been provided to the site coordinators, laboratory staff and surveillance officers to enable the site-team to regularly review site performance, in comparison with set targets. The main objective of these reports is to provide information regarding the overall functioning of the surveillance site, by providing indicators of laboratory participation (submission of isolates), and indicators of surveillance officer performance (completion of CRFs). By reviewing these indicators, problems with data collection can be targeted, and recommendations are provided to improve the site performance. The challenges in providing these reports continued in 2021, due to delays in processing samples and results not readily available. Our roving technologist, employed for the Gauteng enhanced surveillance sites, did help to improve sending of isolates. Enhanced surveillance site quality monitoring In 2021, as per annual performance management and improving quality of data collection, surveillance officers (SOs) were audited in terms of quality of work. CRFs from a fixed time-period were randomly selected for each surveillance officer so that CRFs for each organism could be audited per SO. The medical record files were drawn and the GERMS-coordinating staff filled in a modified clean CRF from the original source data and compared their CRF with the original SO CRF. A scoring system was set up and, although the scores varied widely amongst SOs, many of the errors were ones of omission and overlooking information rather than entry of incorrect data. Data training was done regularly to overcome these errors. Table 2. Cases detected by surveillance audit by province, 2021 NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES GERMS-SA: ANNUAL SURVEILLANCE REVIEW 202110 Enhanced surveillance site project In 2021, 3 386 surveillance case patients were diagnosed at enhanced surveillance sites (Table 3). Of case patients with recorded HIV status, 72% (2 100/2 906) were HIV-infected (Table 4). The proportion of case patients with confirmed HIV infection varied by surveillance disease: unsurprisingly, a very high proportion of patients with AIDS-defining infections like cryptococcosis (98%) were HIV-infected. HIV infection amongst patients with invasive pneumococcal disease, for which HIV is a known risk factor, was 58%.SURVEILLANCE REPORTSTable 3.

A majority (n=4 822, 96%) of these cases were diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis (laboratory tests on cerebrospinal fluid positive for Cryptococcus species), 3% (n=166) with fungaemia species cultured from blood) and 1% (n=16) with culture-positive disease at other sites. Only nine cases were reported from the private sector; however, audits have not been completed. Between 2020 and 2021, the national incidence risk of laboratory-confirmed cryptococcosis decreased from 76 to 67 cases per 100 000 HIV-infected persons. Although the absolute provincial incidence risks remained similar in the Eastern Cape Province over the 2 years, a decrease in the absolute incidence risk with overlapping 95% confidence intervals was noted in the Free State, Mpumalanga, Northern Cape and Western Cape provinces; and a decrease in the absolute incidence risk with no overlapping 95% confidence intervals was noted in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and North West provinces. In addition, an increase in the absolute incidence risk with overlapping 95% confidence intervals was noted in the Limpopo Province (Table 6). The highest incidence risk was recorded among males aged 40-44 years and the peak incidence among females, though lower than for males, was among those aged 35-39 years (Figure 1). Age was known for 4 626 (92%) case patients; the median age was 37 years (interquartile range [IQR], 31 - 44 years) and children younger than 15 years accounted for only 2% of cases (n=86). There were 1 146 case patients reported at ESS during 2021 and case report forms were completed for 77% (n=879). Among 790 patients with known HIV status, 98% (n=775) were confirmed to be HIV-seropositive. About 61% (448/732) of case patients had previously received antiretroviral therapy (ART) or were on ART at the time of cryptococcal disease diagnosis. Of the HIV-seropositive patients, 90% (701/775) had a CD4+ T-lymphocyte (CD4) cell count test result recorded close to the time of diagnosis; the median CD4 cell count was 31 cells/\u00b5l (IQR, 13 - 68 cells/\u00b5l) and 93% (651/701) had a CD4 cell count <200 cells/\u00b5l. Viral test results were available for 539 patients; 19% (n=104) had a viral load viral loads of 400-10 68% (n=366) had viral loads of >10 000 copies/mL. A majority of the case patients received antifungal therapy in hospital (88%, 739/843); 62% containing induction regimen. The in-hospital case-fatality ratio for patients at ESS with a first episode of cryptococcal disease was 40% (344/850).Table 4.

Incidence risk was calculated using mid-year population denominators determined by the Thembisa model and is expressed as cases per 100 000 HIV-infected persons (refer to Table 1). Discussion The national incidence risk of cryptococcal meningitis or culture-confirmed cryptococcal disease decreased overall in 2021 compared to 2020. This decrease may be related to more HIV-seropositive people initiating ART before they are at risk for opportunistic infections. However, an alternative explanation is that this decline is related to barriers to accessing the healthcare system with more COVID-19-related restriction days in 2021 compared to 2020 (https://www.gov.za/covid-19/about/about- alert-system#:~:text=Adjusted%20alert%20level%201%20 is,June%20to%2025%20July%202021). An interrupted time-series analysis is being conducted by the NICD to explore this in more depth. The World Health Organization recommends cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening and pre-emptive fluconazole treatment for all patients with a CD4 cell count of <200 cells/\u00b5l. We only reported a small proportion of patients who were diagnosed with cryptococcal antigenaemia, mainly through provider-initiated screening, in this report. A majority of such cases are detected through the large national reflex CrAg programme [data not shown]. Timely pre-emptive fluconazole treatment given to those with antigenaemia with prevention of meningitis may be another reason for a decline in the absolute incidence risk of meningitis and culture-confirmed disease. The overall in-hospital case-fatality ratio was very high in 2021, despite >50% of the patients at GERMS-SA ESS receiving flucytosine-based induction regimens through an access programme. This may be related to a continued delayed presentation to hospital among people with symptomatic cryptococcal disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. These data indicate the need to generally strengthen the HIV programme in the country to reduce cryptococcal disease and mortality.Figure 1.

Only one case was detected on audit of the NHLS laboratory information system, 18 cases were detected through PCR of relevant specimens and 13 were culture positive. Cases occurred sporadically throughout the year, peaking in May and December (Figure 2). The incidence of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in South Africa for 2021 was 0.05 cases per 100 000 population, with the highest incidence reported from the Western Cape Province (0.2 cases per 100 000 population) followed by the Eastern Cape Province (0.07 cases per 100 000 population) (Table 7). Most organisms were identified from cerebrospinal fluid (59%, 19/32), followed by blood (41%, 13/32) (Table 8). Of 22 isolates/specimens sero/genogrouped, serogroup B (n=14) was dominant, followed by serogroups Y (n=4) and W (n=3) (Table 9). Half the IMD episodes occurred in children <5 years of age, with infants being dispro-portionately affected, particularly with serogroup B (incidence of serogroup B in infants 0.43 per 100 000 population) (Figure 3). There were more males (66%, 21/32) with IMD than females. Of the 13 viable isolates, 77% (10/13) were susceptible to penicillin, the other 3 had intermediate susceptibilities (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentrations between 0.19 and 0.25 \u00b5g/ml). All viable isolates were susceptible to third-generation cephalo-sporins, ciprofloxacin and rifampicin. Sixty-seven percent (10/15) of cases of IMD admitted at GERMS- SA enhanced surveillance hospital sites had clinical data available (Table 4). Two cases were in adults 24-44 years and the rest were in persons less than 10 years of age (5 were infants). All patients survived their hospital stay with a median length of stay of 6 days (interquartile range 3-10 days). All nine patients with HIV results available were HIV-uninfected (Table 4). The majority of patients presented with symptoms of meningitis (8/10), one with bacteraemia and one with pneumonia. The pneumonia episode was in an adult and due to a serogroup B isolate. Of 8 cases with data available on sequelae, one infant with meningococcal meningitis was discharged with complications including hydrocephalus, new-onset seizures and neurological fallout.

Infants are at highest risk of IMD and although a variety of serogroups were circulating, serogroup B was dominant in most provinces and all age groups. As social activities resume to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, there is more opportunity for asymptomatic carriers of meningococcal bacteria to transmit meningococci to others through close contact, thus putting them at risk of developing IMD. Meningococcal disease causes severe infections and has outbreak potential, therefore clinicians are urged to consider the diagnosis in any persons presenting with fever and/or headache with rapid clinical deterioration. Third-generation cephalosporin or high dose intravenous penicillin is still recommended for treatment and should be started without delay should meningococcal disease be suspected. Haemophilus influenzae Results In 2021, 279 cases of invasive Haemophilus influenzae (HI) disease were identified through the GERMS-SA surveillance programme. Thirty-nine percent (108/279) were audit cases, 46 (16%) were detected through PCR and 125 (45%) were available for further characterisation at the NICD (Table 2). Five cases were co-infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Invasive HI disease incidence was 0.46 cases per 100 000 population, similar to that of 2019 (0.44 per 100 000 population) (Table 10). Incidence was highest in the Western Cape Province (1.21 per 100 000 population), followed by Gauteng and Eastern Cape provinces (Table 10). Of cases available for serotyping, non-typeable HI (HNT) (n=60) was most prevalent, followed by type b (Hib) (n=48). Among all HI serotypes, most were detected from blood specimens (62%, 173/279), although significantly more cases from CSF were Hib (19/48, 40%) than (p<0.001) (Table 11). Children <1 years had a higher incidence of Hib (1.37 cases per 100 000), HNT (0.69 per 100 000) and other serotypes (1.11 per 100 000) than other age categories (Figure 4). Hib disease in infants was similar to 2020, but higher than that of 2018 and 2019, whereas HNT disease has declined markedly in the last two years (Figure 5). Ten percent (13/126) of HI cases were non-susceptible to ampicillin, this included Hib and 6/53 HNT episodes with MICs >1mg/L. Clinical information was available for 67% (88/132) of HI cases presenting at enhanced surveillance sites (ESS) (Table 4). Patients were hospitalised for a median of 8 days (IQR 1-15 days). Twenty- five percent (22/88) of patients did not survive their hospital stay, with a median time to death of one day (IQR 1-2 days) from date of specimen collection. Deaths occurred in all age categories, however more deaths occurred amongst those with HNT versus Hib (12/25 (48%) HNT died versus 1/17 (6%) Hib died, p<0.017). Of all HI cases at ESS with known HIV status, 35% (26/75) were HIV-infected (Table 4). Conditions, other than HIV, predisposing to HI disease were reported in 36/88 (41%) patients - the most common conditions included history of smoking (9), prematurity (4), chronic lung disease (4), malignancy (4) and alcoholism (3). Of the 20 surviving HI meningitis patients at ESS, 35% (7/20) suffered sequelae upon discharge - five developed ongoing seizures, three had hydrocephalus, two neurological fallout and one each suffered hearing- and vision-loss. Hib vaccine history was available for 6/10 Hib cases in children <15 years at ESS. All the children were HIV-uninfected, one (3-months old) had not received any vaccine, one (6-months old) had received only one Hib vaccine dose, and 4 had received at least 3 doses each.

Primary Hib vaccination and booster doses are important in preventing invasive Hib in the community. Infants have the highest incidence of HI disease from all serotypes, however all age categories from young children to the elderly are at risk. Many persons with invasive HI had an underlying condition predisposing them to infection and over a third of those surviving an episode of meningitis were discharged from hospital with sequelae. Streptococcus pneumoniae Results Of 1 560 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) reported in 2021, 21% (328/1 560) were detected through audit of the NHLS laboratory information system, 246 (16%) through PCR of invasive body specimens and 986 (63%) were identified through culture (of which 958 were available for further characterisation) (Table 2). Incidence of IPD in South Africa was 2.59 cases per 100 000 persons, slightly higher than 2020 (2.12 per 100 000) (Table 12). The Western Cape Province had the highest incidence of IPD (7.66 per 100 000 population), followed by the Eastern Cape (3.01 per 100 000), Gauteng (2.96 per 100 000) and Free State (2.39 per 100 000) provinces (Table 12). Most cases were detected from blood specimens (69%, 1 070/1 560), followed by cerebrospinal fluid (25%, 397/1 560) (Table 13). Overall, slightly more males than females were affected (52%, 804/1 560 vs 47%, 726/1 560, sex not specified n=30). Infants had the highest IPD incidence (14.23 per 100 000), followed by adults >25 years (3.18 per 100 000) (Figure 6). Penicillin non-susceptibility (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >0.06\u00b5g/ml) was detected in 39% (371/953) of IPD isolates, the highest proportion of penicillin non-susceptible IPD was in children 1-4 years of age (71%, 34/48) and in KwaZulu-Natal Province (24/37, 65%) (Table 14 and Figure 7). Ceftriaxone non-susceptibility (MIC >0.5\u00b5g/ ml) was detected amongst 10% (97/953) of isolates from all specimen types, including 8% (15/182) of IPD isolated from CSF. The five predominant serotypes in children <5 years included serotypes 19F, 8, 10A, 3 and 23B persons >5 years, serotypes 8, 19A, 19F, 3 and 4 were most common (Figure 8B). Overall 34% (325/953) of serotypes causing IPD in South were included in the pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13), this varied by age-category in 10-14 year olds to 38% (95/247) of 45-64 year olds (Table 15 and Figure 9). The newly formulated PCV20 vaccine has potential coverage of 57% (543/953) of serotypes causing IPD in South Africa. Eighty-three percent (495/598) of IPD patients presenting to our enhanced surveillance sites (ESS) had clinical information Figure 5: Incidence rates* of laboratory-confirmed, Haemophilus influenzae serotype b and - ported to GERMS-SA, in children <5 years old, South Africa, 2009-2021*Incidence rates were calculated based on population denominators provided by Statistics South Africa, and are expressed as cases per 100 000 population.

Fifty-three percent (263/495) of patients had a condition/risk factor (excluding HIV-infection) predisposing them to IPD. The top five factors in- cluded: history of smoking (91 patients), chronic lung disease (29 patients), chronic cardiac or renal disease (19 patients each) and malignancy (16 patients). Of 98 patients at ESS with pneumococcus detected in CSF: 43% (42/98) died during their hospitalisation, and 25% (14/56) who survived to discharge suffered at least one sequelae upon discharge - these included new-onset seizures (8), limb weakness/paralysis (5), vision loss (5) and hydrocephalus (2). Vaccination history was available for 9 of 12 children <10 years-of-age at ESS with IPD caused by serotypes pre- sent in the PCV13 vaccine. Two (2/9, 22%) were too young to receive vaccine; two children between 9 and 12 months-of-age had received only 2 doses and five children (56%,5/9; and 4 of whom were over 16 months-of-age) had received all 3 doses of PCV13. The serotypes responsible for disease in those who had received any PCV13 included serotypes 19F (four episodes), 19A (two episodes) and 3 (one episode). Table 13.

Infants have the highest incidence followed by adults 25 years-and-older. Penicillin susceptibility remained high, particularly in infants. HIV-infection and HIV-exposure in infants was a dominant underlying condition amongst those with IPD. In addition, other underlying conditions (excluding HIV) predisposing to IPD were present in over half of the patients. IPD resulted in poor outcomes, with an in-hospital case-fatality ratio of 36%. In-hospital deaths were highest amongst those with pneumococcal meningitis and a quarter of meningitis survivors are discharged from hospital with sequelae. Serotype distribution varies by age-category, with serotypes 8, 19A and 19F predominating. One fifth of IPD amongst infants are still due to serotypes in PCV13, increasing to two-fifths in the 1-4 years age-category, with an overall proportion of 34%. Newer conjugate vaccines such as PCV15 and PCV20 would potentially cover 37% and 57% of current IPD in South Africa, respectively. Healthcare workers and parents need to ensure that all children are up to date with their vaccination schedule.Figure 9: Potential pneumococcal serotype coverage of laboratory-confirmed, invasive pneumococcal report - ed to GERMS-SA, by various pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and age categories, South Africa, 2021 (n=953 viable isolates available for serotyping)Proportion category (years)All invasive specimens (n=658) Blood (n=447) Bone (n=9 3) Skin and soft tissue (n=54) Other (n=64) Figure 10.

The invasive group A strep case definition includes individuals with group A strep isolated from sterile site specimens, as well as isolates from non-sterile site specimens with a diagnosis of septic shock or necrotising fasciitis. Incidence of invasive group A strep was highest in infants (4.72 per 100 000) with a second peak in those aged >64 years (1.52 per 100 000) (Figure 10). Incidence was highest in the Western Cape Province (3.16 per 100 000), followed by Eastern Cape (1.60 per 100 000) and Gauteng provinces (1.02 per 100 000) (Table 16A). Where sex was known, more disease occurred in males (389/642, 61%) than females. In children <5 years-of-age, 91% (87/96) of cases were diagnosed from blood culture, and amongst those >5 years of age 64% (329/517) were on blood culture, 17% (90/517) from bone specimens and 10% (50/517) from skin and soft tissue (Table 16B). Of those isolates available for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, 99% (339/342) were susceptible to penicillin (MIC<0.06\u00b5g/ml) and 95% (326/342) were susceptible to erythromycin (MIC<0.25\u00b5g/ml) (Table 17). At enhanced surveillance sites, 58% (242/415) of invasive group A strep cases had clinical data available (Table 4). Most patients were admitted from home with a median time from admission to specimen collection of 0 days (IQR 0-4 days). Patients were admitted for a median of 7 days (IQR 2-15 days). Overall 31% (65/211) died in hospital, with most deaths occurring in persons >5 years (58/173, 34% vs 5/35, 14% in children <5 years, 3 with unknown age). Most patients with invasive group A strep had wound infections (89/203, 44%), patients with HIV test results available were HIV-infected (Table 4). Common risk factors for invasive group A strep included concurrent skin infections (31/203, 15%), blunt trauma or surgery in the past two weeks (16/203, 8% each).Group A Streptococcus (n=658) Blood (cases per 1 5-24 25-44 45-64 >645 4 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0Skin and soft tissue (n=54) Other (n=64)NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES GERMS-SA: ANNUAL SURVEILLANCE REVIEW 202124 Discussion Invasive group A strep mostly affected infants and the elderly, with infections originating potentially from disruptions to the skin.

Incidence for early-onset group B strep (<7 days) was 0.36 per 1 000 live births and 0.21 per 1 000 live births for late-onset (7-90 days) invasive disease (Table 18). Gauteng Province reported the highest incidence of early-onset group B strep (0.66 per 1 000 live births), while Western Cape Province reported the highest incidence of late-onset group B strep (0.35 per 1 000 live births) (Table 18). Nationally, in 2021 incidence of invasive group B strep in infants was 60 per 100 000 population, starting at 51 per 100 000 amongst neonates and decreased rapidly by advancing month of age (Figure 11A). In persons >1 year of age, overall incidence of invasive group B strep was 0.6 per 100 000, peaking at 1 per 100 000 in those >64 years of age (Figure 11B). In infants, most cases were isolated from blood (605/694, 87%) or cerebrospinal fluid (85/694, 12%) (Table 19). However, in persons >1 year of age, blood (193/333, 58%) and genitourinary tract specimens (96/333, 29%) were most frequent (Table 19). Where sex was known, in infants 52% (349/670) of disease occurred in males, however in persons >1 year most disease occurred in females (63%, 208/328). Of the specimens available for serotyping, serotype III was dominant (183/433, 40%), followed by serotype Ia (119, 26%) (Table 20). Serotypes III, Ia and V were the most dominant serotypes causing invasive disease in both early-onset group B strep and in those >90 days-of-age (Figure 12). Whereas serotypes III and Ia were the predominant serotypes amongst late-onset disease (7-90 days-of-age). Ninety-seven percent (430/442) of invasive group B strep isolates were susceptible to penicillin (MIC<0.12mg/l). Sixty-four percent (386/600) of invasive group B strep cases at enhanced surveillance sites had clinical data available (Table 4). Median days for admission were 7 (IQR 2-16 days). Nineteen percent (71/367) of persons with invasive group B strep died, including 18% (38/206) of neonates. Underlying maternal risk factors for neonates developing invasive group B strep included: 34% (67/200) with premature rupture of membranes prior to birth, 9% (15/168) with prolonged rupture of membranes (>18 hours prior to delivery), and 3% (6/200) with pre-eclampsia. Neonatal risk factors for developing invasive group B strep included 46% (77/168) with prematurity (<37 weeks gestation), 23% (<1 500g), who (Streptococcus agalactiae) Table 18.

Serotype III and Ia dominated across all age- categories. Majority of isolates were susceptible to penicillin, which remains the first-line antimicrobial agent for targeting neonatal sepsis. Mortality was high across all age bands. Among neonates with invasive group B strep, preterm birth was an important predisposing factor. Results A total of 131 cases of laboratory-confirmed enteric fever were identified through the active enteric fever surveillance programme of the Centre for Enteric Diseases in 2021. The cases include Salmonella Typhi isolated from all sample sites, of which 80% (105/131) were blood cultures. There were no cases of enteric fever caused by Salmonella enterica serovars Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B or Para-typhi C. Enteric fever cases were reported from all provinces except Northern Cape and Limpopo (Table 21), but the majority (67%, 88/131) were reported from two provinces: Western Gauteng (37/131, 28%). Most cases (89%, 117/131) were identified in the public health sector. By age group, the number of cases was highest in children aged 5 to 14 years (40/131, 31%), followed by adults aged 25 to 34 years (24/131, 18%) and adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24 years (18/131, 14%), as shown in Table 22. An increase in the number of cases from October through December was observed (Figure 13). Of the isolates received and tested at the centre, 88% (108/123) were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and 99% (122/123) azithromycin and Paratyphi C Table 21.

Following the outbreaks in 2005-2006, the number of culture-confirmed cases annually has remained stable at <150 cases per year. However, the number of cases in 2021 (n=131) was the highest annual total since the enteric fever outbreaks of 2005-2006. A comparison of cases by month shows a similar pattern of higher case numbers in October through January for the last three years, which could suggest seasonality (Figure 14). The age distribution of cases is similar to that reported in previous years, with children aged 5 to 14 years being most affected. Although small, localised outbreaks of typhoid fever were identified in 2021, most cases were sporadic. The majority of cases acquired Salmonella Typhi infection in South Africa; few cases were imported (travel-related), mostly from neighbouring countries. Salmonella Typhi isolates from both invasive and non-invasive sites are included in these analyses, as both add to the burden of infection in South Africa and represent a public health risk. The diagnosis of enteric fever remains challenging; heightened clinical awareness and appropriate laboratory tests are critical in identifying cases. Culture remains the gold standard for confirming enteric fever, so prevailing clinician testing behaviour heavily influences the likelihood of detecting cases. Greater numbers of cases reported from Gauteng and Western Cape provinces could reflect healthcare-seeking behaviour and prevailing clinician testing practices, but small localised outbreaks were also confirmed in these provinces. Although the proportion of isolates showing resistance to ciprofloxacin (12%) is lower than recent years, this remains a major concern. Salmonella Typhi isolates should routinely be tested against azithromycin, which is an alternative oral antibiotic option for treating disease caused by ciprofloxacin resistant strains. Ceftriaxone may also be used as an alternative therapy, but needs to be administered parenterally. Cases of enteric fever caused by Salmonella enterica serovars Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B or Paratyphi C remain uncommon in South Africa, with no cases reported in 2021.NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES GERMS-SA: ANNUAL SURVEILLANCE REVIEW 202130 Results A total of 2 445 cases of nontyphoidal salmonellosis were reported through the surveillance programme in 2021. This includes nontyphoidal Salmonella isolated from all sample sites, of which 41% (1 010/2 445) were indicative of invasive disease. Fifty-four percent of the total cases (1 323/2 445) were identified in the public health sector. There was a striking difference in the proportion of cases which were invasive in the public health sector (68%, 906/1 323) versus those in the private health sector (9%, 104/1 122). This could be due in part to differences in health-seeking behaviour and diagnostic practices among clinicians in the respective health sectors. The highest numbers of cases of invasive disease were reported from Gauteng (380/1 010, 38%), followed by Western Cape (235/1 010, 23%) and Eastern Cape (121/1 010, 12%) provinces (Table 24). Gauteng also reported the highest number of cases of non-invasive disease (44%, 638/1 435), followed by Western Cape (24%, 339/1 435) and KwaZulu-Natal (8%, 123/1 435) provinces. As in previous years, although seasonal prevalence was noted for non-invasive disease (lower numbers of cases identified in the winter months); no overt seasonal pattern was noted with invasive disease (Figure 15). Non-invasive disease was highest in children younger than five years (452/1 435, 31%) followed by persons aged 35 to 44 years (171/1 435, 12%) and 45 to 54 years (161/1 435, 11%), as shown in Table 25. Invasive disease was most common in persons aged 35 to 44 years (226/1 010, 22%) followed by children younger than five years (165/1 010, 16%) and persons aged 45 to 54 years (149/1 010, 15%). Most invasive cases were identified from blood cultures (74%, 749/1 010) - Table 26. A total of 2 185 viable isolates were received and serotyped; this included isolates submitted as part of routine laboratory- based surveillance as well as isolates submitted for outbreak investigation purposes. A total of 71 serovars were identified, but two serovars accounted for 79% of the cases: Salmonella Enteritidis 185, 60%) and Salmonella Typhimurium (421/2 185, 19%). The next most common serotypes were Salmonella enterica subspecies salamae, Salmonella Hadar, Salmonella Muenster and Salmonella Isangi (Table 27). Proportions of common serovars differed among provinces, but Salmonella Enteritidis was the most common serotype in all provinces (Figure 16). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was not routinely performed, but offered on request.Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) Figure 14.

Invasive disease is usually associated with HIV infection or the presence of other risk factors. More cases were reported in 2021 (n=2 445) than in 2020 (n=2 306), but the pattern suggestive of seasonality was largely preserved (Figure 17). As in previous years, although seasonal prevalence was noted for non-invasive disease (increased numbers in the earlier months of the year and low numbers in the winter months), invasive disease showed no seasonality. Greater numbers of invasive disease reported from Gauteng and Western Cape provinces may reflect healthcare seeking behaviour and clinician testing practices. Children younger than 5 years bear the highest burden of non-invasive disease, but invasive disease was reported more commonly in adults aged 35-44 years; as in previous years, this is likely the effect of a high proportion of HIV-infected cases in this age group. Salmonella Enteritidis was the predominant serovar, followed by Salmonella Typhimurium, a pattern observed since 2012. Provincial differences in serovar proportions might reflect local transmission dynamics or undetected outbreaks, and require further investigation. The noticeable increase in infections with Salmonella enterica sub-species salamae is unusual and requires monitoring and investigation. Results A total of 514 culture-confirmed cases of shigellosis was reported through the surveillance programme in 2021. Most cases (82%, 420/514) were identified in the public health sector (Table 28). The total includes Shigella spp. isolated from all sample sites, but in 88% (454/514) of the cases the isolate was recovered from stool or rectal swab samples reflecting non-invasive dysentery or diarrhoea (Table 29); in the remaining 12% of cases, the isolate was recovered from blood or CSF culture (32/514, 7%) or other extra-intestinal sample sites (28/514, 5%). The highest number of shigellosis cases occurred in January through March (Figure 18). Fifty-five percent of cases were reported from Western Cape Province alone (285/514); Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces contributed 18% (92/514) and 11% (59/514) of the total cases respectively (Table 29). Cases of shigellosis were highest in children younger than five years (207/514, 40%) followed by children 5 to 14 years of age (72/514, 14%) - Table 30. The proportion of invasive shigellosis cases remains low (7%), and as in previous years invasive disease was highest in children younger than five years (13/32, 40%). A total of 392 viable isolates were received and serotyped; this included isolates submitted as part of routine laboratory based surveillance as well as isolates submitted for outbreak investigation purposes. The most common serotype was S. flexneri type 2a sonnei next common serotypes were S. flexneri type 4, S. flexneri type 3a and S. flexneri type 4c (Table 31). Proportions of the serotypes differed among provinces (Figure 19). The predominant serotype dif- fered among provinces; S. flexneri type 2a predominated in six provinces.

Children younger than five-years continue to bear the highest burden of shigellosis. The primary manifestation of disease due to Shigella is non-invasive dysentery or diarrhoea, and invasive disease is uncommon.Fewer cases were reported in 2021 (n=514) than in 2020 (n=698). In contrast to previous years, there was not a typical pattern suggestive of seasonality; usually, increased numbers of cases are identified in the earlier months of the year and lower numbers in the winter months (Figure 20). S. flexneri type 2a, S. sonnei and S. flexneri type 1b were the predominant serotypes, in keeping with previous years. Provincial differences in serotype proportions might reflect local transmission dynamics or undetected out-breaks. Results Only cases of campylobacteriosis for which isolates were received from diagnostic laboratories are reported here. Audits were not performed, so cases for which isolates were not submitted are not included in the report. Of the 655 isolates of Campylobacter spp. submitted through the surveillance programme in 2021, 92% (601) were submitted by diagnostic laboratories in the private sector. This includes Campylobacter spp. isolated from all sample sites, but in 99%(649/655) of the cases the isolate was recovered from stool or rectal swab samples reflecting non-invasive diarrhoeal disease. There was no apparent seasonal pattern (Figure 21). Western Cape Province reported the highest number of cases (48%) followed by Gauteng Province (41%); these two provinces alone accounted for 90% of the total cases (Table 32). Case numbers were highest in children younger than five years (206/631, 31%) - Table 33. Confirmatory speciation and antimicrobial susceptibility testing have not been completed.

Reporting of all cases through the notifiable medical conditions (NMC) platform by healthcare workers and laboratorians is mandatory. The Centre for Enteric Diseases runs the active listeriosis surveillance programme, and every notification is followed up by the centre team. For each case, this includes contacting the diagnostic laboratory to facilitate referral of isolate(s), and contacting relevant healthcare professionals or Department of Health officials to facilitate completion of specific listeriosis case investigation forms. GERMS-SA surveillance officers at enhanced surveillance sites assist with completing the case investigation forms for cases identified at their sites.ListeriosisDiscussion The number of Campylobacter spp. isolates submitted by public sector laboratories (54/655, 8%) is very low, and strikingly disproportionate to the size of the population served in comparison to the number of isolates submitted from the private sector. However, audits of NHLS CDW data were not performed and cases in the public sector are therefore underreported. Differences in health-seeking behaviour and diagnostic practices among clinicians in the respective health sectors, as well as differences in laboratory methods utilised for culture of Campylobacter spp. from stool samples are also likely contributing factors. Results A total of 76 cases of listeriosis was notified through the NMC surveillance system in 2021. Three provinces reported 84% - Table 34. Cases were most common among neonates 28 days (34%, 26/76) and adults aged 15 -49 years (34%, 26/76) - Table 35. Twenty-two of the 76 cases (29%) were detected at ESS, but listeriosis case investigation forms were only completed for 8 cases (36%) at these sites. Discussion The number of listeriosis cases for 2021 (76) is below the expected range of annual cases (119-298) based on the estimated incidence of sporadic cases (2-5 cases per million population per year). The distribution of cases by province and age group is similar to that reported in 2019 and 2020. Table 34.

The last case of toxigenic V. cholerae O1 was identified in 2020.Results Three cases of Vibrio cholerae infection were notified through the NMC surveillance system in 2020. Isolates were received for all cases, and all were confirmed to be nontoxigenic non-O1, non-O139 V. cholerae. Results COVID-19 still predominated in 2021, hampering our surveillance activities. A total of 249 sputum samples were collected from enrolled participants. Majority of samples received were from KwaZulu-Natal (25%), followed by Gauteng (24%), North West (21%), Eastern Cape (17%), and Mpumalanga (13%) provinces. Cultures were negative in 27% (68/249) of samples processed, and 2% (5/249) were contaminated, precluding further analysis. Valid drug susceptibility results for INH were available for 176 isolates, for which 163 completed CRFs were available for analysis. Eighty percent (141/176) were smear positive. Majority of participants were male (60%) while 61% were HIV positive, of which 63% (62/99) were already on ART. Fifteen percent reported to have at least one episode of previous TB infection, and six percent reported having two or more episodes of previous TB. Twenty-four percent (39/160) reported to have lived with a person diagnosed with TB in the last 12 months. Table 36 shows the comparison of risk factors by INH resistance. Isoniazid resistance was detected in 13 samples; four were from North West and Eastern Cape, two from KZN and Gauteng, and one from Mpumalanga provinces. The prevalence was 7.4% [(95% CI: 3.5% - 11.2%)]. Only six participants reported taking TB preventative therapy, none of these participants had INH Resistance.

Wayne, PA: Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Discussion The majority of participants with TB were co-infected with HIV highlighting its continued importance in controlling the TB epidemic. Anti-retroviral treatment has been previously shown to reduce TB incidence, almost two-thirds of the participants were already part of the ARV program. Number of participants reporting TB preventative therapy (TPT) exposure was extremely low, only six of the 99 HIV-positive participants reported being on TPT. Age and gender distribution of the participants was in keeping with the National reports, showing male dominance. The overall prevalence of IMR (7.4%) is in keeping with what was found in the National TB drug resistant survey 2012-2014 (5-8%). Unfortunately, the low number of samples received during this surveillance year does not allow for any robust analysis of resistance rates and accurate comparison to previous years. The high smear-positivity is indicative of transmission, particularly in the North West Province. No significant risk factor for INH resistance was detected, however, there is weak evidence of association with previous household contact which needs to be explored. Only four of the 39 participants reported to have a close TB contact were screened, which reveals a gap in the care-cascade that requires strengthening. However, the lack of screening in 2020 and 2021 could also be due to the pressures (staff shortages etc.) of the COVID-19 pandemic. A large proportion of participants were unemployed (75%), an underappreciated factor that has an impact on health delivery. The findings of this surveillance has important public health importance, and even though the surveillance was conducted only at a few sites, the results obtained are useful and insightful to understand the epidemic and monitor trends. Large scale epidemiological studies evaluating diarrhoeal disease burden showed that rotavirus was the most important cause of disease in children <2 years (1-3). To try to reduce the burden of rotavirus disease in South Africa, the rotavirus vaccine was introduced into the immunization program in August 2009. Subsequent surveillance studies after vaccine introduction have shown a decrease in both rotavirus-specific (54-58% reduction in children <5 years; (4) and (45-65% reduction in children <12 months and 40-50% reduction in children 13-24 months) (5). Despite successful introduction of the rotavirus vaccine and improvements in access to safe water and sanitation, acute diarrhoeal diseases were still responsible for 15% of hospital admissions in children <5 years at a tertiary hospital in South Africa (6). The incidence of diarrhoeal diseases for 2016 (612 per 100 000) was 58% lower than the 2006-2008 (pre-vaccine introduction) rates (1 470 per 100 000) (6). In addition, diarrhoeal mortality decreased from 3.5% to 2.9% during the same periods at this site (6). In a Malawian study, the rotavirus vaccine was estimated to reduce overall diarrhoeal mortality by 30% (7). As diarrhoeal diseases still contribute to morbidity and mortality in children <5 years, research needs to continue. In addition, there are gaps in our knowledge around the burden in individuals >5 years and vulnerable groups including children with severe acute malnutrition, men who have sex with men, the elderly and immunocompromised people. Furthermore, continuous monitoring of rotavirus in children <5 years is required to ensure that the vaccine formulation and the immunisation program are functioning optimally and to identify any rotavirus strains that may escape vaccine protection. Syndromic surveillance Diarrhoeal surveillanceNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES GERMS-SA: ANNUAL SURVEILLANCE REVIEW 202142 Methods In 2021, diarrhoeal disease surveillance was conducted at sentinel sites in three provinces as part of the GERMS-SA surveillance, including: Red Cross Children's Hospital (RCCH), Michells Plain Hospital (MPH), Eastridge Clinic (ERC, Western Cape Province), Pelonomi Hospital (PNH, Free State Province) and Klerksdorp Hospital (KDH, North West Province). All persons admitted to a sentinel hospital for the treatment of acute diarrhoea (as defined by the World Health Organization, and of 7 days duration) were approached for enrolment. Enrolment was conducted systematically from Monday to Friday (08:00 - 17:00), after informed consent was obtained from the patient or from a parent or guardian. Demographic, clinical and outcome data were collected in a structured questionnaire by dedicated surveillance officers. Stool specimens were collected for rotavirus (commercial EIA and standardised characterisation protocols) and enteric pathogens (commercial molecular detection kits and in-house real-time detection assays) screening at the Centre for Enteric Diseases, NICD. Data from a companion surveillance program (African Network for improved Diagnostics, Epidemiology and Management of Common Infectious Agents (ANDEMIA); investigating diarrhoeal diseases in all ages in Kalafong, Mapulaneng and Matikwane hospitals) with the same enrolment criteria and testing were included in the analysis. Results A total of 298 stool specimens were screened in 2021 with 20% (59/298) positive for rotavirus. An additional 309 specimens from ANDEMIA sites were screened in 2021 with a rotavirus prevalence of 17% (51/309). Most of the rotavirus cases were detected between April and July (Figure 22) with G2P[4] strains predominant (69% of rotavirus cases) and G3P[8] also circulating (19% of rotavirus cases). A total of 607 specimens were also screened for other enteric viruses and the following were detected: adenovirus in (n=605) were also screened for bacteria and parasites. The prevalence of various enteric pathogens included Shigella of cases. Six Shiga- toxin producing E. coli (<1%) cases were also detected. The majority of the cases enrolled in the GERMS-SA diarrhoeal surveillance were children <5 of diarrhoeal cases enrolled and the number of rotavirus positive cases per week in 2021. Stools tested for RV RV detection rateEpidemiological weekNumbers of stools tested Detection rate (%)NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES GERMS-SA: ANNUAL SURVEILLANCE REVIEW 202143 Discussion The rotavirus detection rate for 2021 (18%) was much higher than the 6% in 2020 and the 11% in 2019 and 2018 seasons. The season was also earlier in 2021 and longer than the last two years. This was probably partially due to a return to work and school as well as a reflection of sub-optimal vaccination levels during the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Enteric virus prevalence trends were similar to 2020 levels for adenovirus (24% in 2020) and sapovirus (5% in 2020). However, norovirus prevalence was higher in 2021 (16%) compared to 2020 and 2019 (11%), while astrovirus prevalence was lower than 2020 and 2019 (6% in 2020 and 7% in 2019). While the prevalence of viral pathogen increased in 2021, the prevalence of bacterial pathogens and parasites was lower than the levels seen in 2020. This may partially due to an increase in the number of cases enrolled in surveillance that could also mirror current trends in healthcare-seeking behaviour. Alternatively, it could reflect a return to pre-pandemic routines with decreased in adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions like hand washing, social distancing and regular cleaning of frequently touched surfaces.

COVID-19 continued to disrupt ongoing surveillance in 2021 in various forms. Face-to-face interaction of surveillance staff and patients was slowly introduced as further easing of restrictions came. There was sustained increase in numbers of GERMS-SA cases as hospital admissions for other diseases, not related to COVID-19, and outpatient consultations increased. The fire at CMJAH at the beginning of 2021 impacted the workload from that hospital. Training and auditing of our surveillance officers data quality is continually done to improve data quality. Opportunistic infections: For 2021, the laboratory-confirmed cryptococcosis incidence risk decreased in all provinces compared to 2020. The in-hospital case-fatality rate continues to be high (40%) despite more than half of patients receiving flucytosine-based induction regimens. Rifampicin-susceptible TB surveillance in five provinces, over a limited surveillance time-period, showed 61% of patients being HIV-infected and 63% already on anti-retroviral treatment. Screening of TB contacts requires strengthening but this may have been a consequence of health-care access during the pandemic. A large proportion of participants were unemployed (75%), an underappreciated factor that has an impact on health delivery. For non-typhoidal salmonellosis, HIV infection remains to be the single most important risk factor for invasive disease and reported more commonly in adults aged 35-44 years. The noticeable increase in infections with Salmonella enterica subspecies salamae is unusual and requires monitoring and investigation. Vaccine-preventable diseases: The 2021 data continue to monitor trends in IPD and Hib, post-EPI vaccine introduction of PCV13 and Hib booster (2009). Incidence of invasive HI remains low similar to that of 2019. Infants have the highest incidence of HI, with Hib predominating over HNT. Of children with Hib infection and all HIV-uninfected, vaccine failures continue to be a challenge as many were not fully vaccinated. Overall case-fatality from HI is high with a large proportion of patients with HI meningitis developing long-term sequelae. The national incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease remained low compared to pre-COVID-19 years across all age categories. In-hospital mortality from IPD remains high and a third of patients who survived IPD meningitis suffered sequelae. Serotype distribution of 8, 19A and 19F predominating in various age-categories. One fifth of IPD disease in infants and two-fifths in the 1-4 years age-category was caused by serotypes in PCV13. Newer conjugate vaccines such as PCV15 and PCV20 would potentially cover 37% and 57% of current IPD in South Africa, respectively. Healthcare workers and parents need to ensure that all children are up to date with their vaccination schedule. The incidence of early- and late-onset group B strep seems low, with large variations by province, possibly due to under-ascertainment of cases through poor blood-culturing practices particularly amongst neonates. Serotype distribution is similar to that reported by other countries, with serotype III and Ia predominating. The organism remains susceptible to first-line antimicrobial agents targeting neonatal sepsis. Mortality is high across all age bands and preterm birth remains a predisposing factor amongst a large proportion of neonates with invasive group B strep. Epidemic-prone diseases: The incidence of invasive meningococcal disease in 2021 was low compared to 2020. Serogroup B was dominant in most provinces and all age groups. Penicillin non-susceptibility decreased to 23%, however all viable isolates were susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin and rifampicin. Risk of developing IMD in creasing as social activities resume to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. In 2021, enteric fever cases were highest since 2005-2006 outbreaks. All isolates were susceptible to azithromycin and 12% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Although Shigella infection has been associated with waterborne outbreaks in South Africa, person-to-person transmission plays an important role. Fewer cases of shigellosis were reported in 2021 than in 2020 and contrary to previous years there was no typical pattern suggestive of seasonality. The number of listeriosis cases for 2021 (76) is below the expected range of annual cases (119-298) based on the estimated incidence of sporadic cases (2-5 cases per million population per year). For 2021 through the NMC surveillance system, three cases of cholera were reported and confirmed to be nontoxigenic non-O1, non-O139 V. cholerae. These reported cases are not considered to be cholera and do not warrant a public health response. There was no apparent seasonal pattern for campylobacteriosis cases and highest case numbers were reported in children younger than five years (206/631, 31%). Invasive group A strep mostly affects infants and the elderly, with origin of the disease spreading mostly from the skin. In- hospital mortality is high. Isolates are highly susceptible to first line antimicrobial agents, penicillin and erythromycin. Syndromic surveillance Diarrhoeal surveillance: The prevalence of viral pathogens increased in 2021 while that of bacterial pathogens and parasites was lower than the levels seen in 2020 probably due to an increase in the number of cases enrolled in surveillance or return to pre-pandemic routines.
