It is on WHO's list of essential medicines and it was developed in Japan, also won a Nobel Prize in 2015 for it's global and historic impacts in eradicating parasitic infections in many parts of the world. For some reason it is very hard to get a prescription for it(also can be purchased on Amazon). It is proven that it can help with Covid, after Covid long haulers side effects and after vaccine side effects. I took it. But only 1 dose because it made my heart race. But wondering if it worked in addition to the supplements. Just to clarify - ivermectin made my heart race, not the supplements. I have light sensitivity issues as well, mostly in my right eye. Screens have been the biggest problem. I was able to start watching TV on Sunday for the first time in 6 weeks and working on my computer. I'm on a very low dose of Amitriptyline. Thinking of starting the supplements listed here - I'm desperate (like everyone else) to get back to normal. [nodiagnosis](https://vestibular.org/participant/nodiagnosis/)and [nodiagnosis](https://vestibular.org/participant/nodiagnosis/)reacted The supplements were fine. Ivermectin made my heart race. The glutathione dose is a lot more than prescribed on the bottle. I took 2 tsps 3x a day. But after 2 days I felt better so I dropped the dose because it was slightly bothering my stomach. I was saying if you dont want to start with so much you can start with less and add more over a few days. (Like 2 tsp 2x a day then add a 3rd etc). Hope that helps. i do wonder if the Ivermectin helped more than I thought even though I took very little. It felt more like the supplements. [@dizzyfromvaccine](https://vestibular.org/participant/dizzyfromvaccine/) yes, that's what I understood. Thank you for verifying Study concerning Covid immunity from infection... \"For SARS-CoV, a coronavirus very like SARS-CoV-2 that was originally identified in 2003 and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the continued presence of high concentrations of neutralizing antibodies in blood serum for more than 17 years was reported in 2020. Wang and colleagues' results suggest that long-term immunity might also be expected for SARS-CoV-2.\" \"The good news is that the evidence thus far predicts that infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces long-term immunity in most individuals.\" Update on employment vaccination requirements: [https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/employer-s-right-to-require-coronavirus-8867927/](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/employer-s-right-to-require-coronavirus-8867927/) I said it feels like when I had covid and my chest is so painful, like when I had covid, so it does seem like long hauler syndrome. They'll never get me to have another vaccine, I'll look for another job that doesn't force me to become ill by having it. That though depends if I recover enough to return to work. No more vaccine for me that's for sure!

(I don't know how to find the whole paper.) [https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab465/6279075](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab465/6279075) [David Walt](https://wyss.harvard.edu/team/core-faculty/david-walt/), one of the study's authors, a professor at Harvard Medical School, writing to refute someone's concerned interpretation of this study: \"While it is true that the spike protein has 'superantigen' properties, which means it has the POTENTIAL to cause adverse effects, we know that it doesn't cause these effects in many infected patients, it doesn't cause many of these superantigen effects in most vaccinated individuals, and the levels are incredibly low in the blood, suggesting this shouldn't be a concern\" Not in \"many\" patients? Not \"many\" Not in \"most\" individuals? So ....what about us few? Hi All, Seeing a lot of posts on here about taking various supplements to help with our various symptoms. I am not a GP or a Health Care professional, but I am an athlete and someone who is finely tuned into my body. I would recommend that folk take as much care and do as much investigation about what they are eating if not more so than what supplements might help. Better still combine the two and you have a really good way of combating the symptoms. You can take all the supplements and vitamins in the world, but if you are getting next to no exercise and eating sausage rolls and chips and chugging that down with a can of coke every day (I'm not saying that any of you ARE doing this, but as an example) ..... then that undo's everything !! Eating foods that are natural antioxidents and natural anti inflamatorys along with the supplements, plenty of water AND LOTS of exercise and doing this consistently will put you in a much better position. Super Foods such as. Avocado, Leek, Spinach (not too much), Broccoli, Fish (Salmon, Mackeral are good ones), Nuts, Blueberries, Strawberrys (not too much), Banana, Raspberry, Brown Rice, Chicken (not too much), Eggs, small amounts of Cheese, Beetroot. All of those above can help fight inflamation, provide energy and kill toxins. And cut down if not eradicate entirely Alcohol, Fizzy Drinks, Biscuits, any food with pastry in it, Fast Food, Caffiene, Sweets, because those foods create inflamation and can cause toxicity. We have to look at it in 3 ways. 1 Reduce Inflamation 2 Reduce Toxin levels 3 Get LOTS of exercise, get blood flowing through the body, reset the ear, eye, brain co-ordination, give the body stimulus, help with bone density, white and red blood cell health, help the bodies ability to deliver oxygen around the body, boost the immune systems own health (if that makes sense), help elasticity and strength of ligaments and tendons. Like I said I am NOT a GP or Health Care professional, but to me this is just a logical 3 pronged approach. If our bodies are under attack from the vaccine then we have to attack the attack and the only way we can do that is by getting the body in as better position as we possibly can to fight it. All of course in my opinion and I understand that for some doing all of that will be a very hard challenge, but I think if we really and truly want to be rid of these symptoms and get back to something of a normal life than it's worth the sacrifice of a few months and who knows maybe afterwards IF taking this approach works, some of us might find we enjoy living this way and it might open up a whole new world for us, cycling, running, swimming, yoga, the gym, pilates, walking, football, golf, gardening, making films outside, photography anything that gets you outside in the air and moving. It's time to fight back people !!!

There is a group of doctors treating \"post vaccine inflammatory syndrome\" with Ivermectin.

I know these things, but reading your encouragement is inspiring! I've got an OTC med I'll not be taking to return to the pharmacy, and I wrote down your superfoods list to take with me across the street to the grocery. I'm not up to being very athletic right now after having a major relapse 3 days ago, but I am looking forward to soon becoming able to start doing that walking I've been pushing myself towards. I've been so unwell my neighbor brought his riding mower over and mowed my yard for me today, but then afterwards I got out and walked around it. I know I've got to get back moving again ASAP. And I'd love to eventually get back on my bicycle. Small steps can add up... "}
