It is a good tool for readers to heal from their toxic spirituality, wash away their guilt and shame, and connect with the profundity of the Divine. It is a story of healing, liberation, embracing the Lord, identifying bad spirituality, and getting connected with the authentic one. The author's personal journey with Jesus is a revelation of his confrontation with trauma, toxicity, and abuse, and unveils toxic Jesus to readers. Toxic Jesus gives an entirely new perception of toxic spirituality and authentic spirituality. Marc-Henri Sandoz Paradella speaks about his upbringing in a strict fundamentalist family and how working as a pastor in an evangelist church helped him discern the difference between toxic spirituality and its effects. It is thought-provoking and interesting to note how he discovered meditation and yoga, and his words will help readers find out if there is a toxic Jesus present in their belief system. The author is also very honest when he discusses his life story and experiences, and his personal relationship with Jesus. The topic discussed is original and unique and will help readers perceive if their spirituality is twisted or toxic. It is a good eye-opener for readers to take stock of their relationship with Jesus and find out where changes need to be made to have a proper lifelong relationship with Jesus. So do you believe in toxic Jesus or authentic Jesus?
