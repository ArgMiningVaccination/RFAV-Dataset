Form Completed By..................................................................78 Data Dictionary Case Number / Case Definition 5 The first data entry page that appears on your screen is the Case Definition Page, which corresponds to the \"Case Number \" section of the paper form. This is where you create the unique identifier for the case you are entering . The paper form allows for five levels of information to define a case: State, C ounty or Team Number, Year of Review, and Sequence of Review. However, depending on th e profile that your state has established with the National Center, you may not see all of these options. State This identifier is automatica lly filled in for you, and you ca nnot edit this field. Every state has a unique identifier. County or Team Number This identifier indicates the local team. Fo r states with County teams, this will be a county. For states with non-c ounty teams, this will be the te am name. Local-level users will have this identifier filled in automatica lly and will not be able to edit this field. State-level users will be able to select from among the counties or teams in their state to fill in this field. Year of Review This identifier is automatically filled in to the current year. You can edit this field in order to enter cases from past years. Sequence of Review This identifier is automatically filled in to the next highest sequence number for the current year. For example, if the last se quence number you entered in the current year was \"00021\" then the next new case you enter will come up as sequence \"00022\", regardless of whether sequences \"00019\" or \"00 020\" exist. You can edit this field to any sequence number. Number must be numeri c only - no letters or characters allowed. Death Certificate # Death certificate number as stat ed on death certificate.

The goal of this game, most often played by younger adolescents (9 -14 year-olds) is to achi eve a brief high or euphoric state by stopping the flow of oxygen-contai ning blood to the brain. Sometimes children choke each other until the person being choked pa sses out. The pressure on the arteries is then released and blood flow to the brain resumes, causing a \"rush\" as consciousness returns. There are variations of this activ ity, which could involve purposefully induced hyper-ventilation or the use of ligatures. It ma y be most dangerous when played alone, as the child may lose consciousness before be ing able to release the mechanism of asphyxiation, thereby causing deat h. Select 'U/K' if the team could not determine if the child was participating in the 'choking ga me' or intentionally killed him/herself. Section G4. Dictionary Section G4.

Code as 'yes' if the team be lieves that environmental tobacco exposure contributed to the death. Do not code yes if the child was a smoker but secondhand smoke was not known to be a contributor. Secondhand smoke, also known as environmental tobacco smoke, is a complex mixture of gases and particles that includes smoke from the burning cigarette, cigar, or pipe tip (sidestream sm oke) and exhaled mainstream smoke. Secondhand smoke contains at least 250 chemicals known to be toxic, including more than 50 that can cause cancer. (National Toxicology Program . 11th Report on Carcinogens, 2005) Section G11. Medical Condition Data Dictionary Section G11. Medical Condition 54Secondhand smoke exposure causes respirator y symptoms in children and slows their lung growth. Secondhand smoke causes acute re spiratory infections, ear problems, and more frequent and severe asthma attacks in children. There is no risk-free level of secondhand smoke exposure. Even br ief exposure can be dangerous. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General, 2006) G11i: Were there access or complia nce issues related to the death?

H1g: Child in new/different sleep environment? Child was sleeping in an environment new or different to child up to one week prior to the death. A new or different sl eep environment refers to an environment that is not part of the child's normal routine. If the child went to Grandma's house every Tuesday, this Section H. Other Circumstances of Incident Data Dictionary Section H. Other Circumstances of Incident 57is considered part of the usua l routine. If the child had st arted attending a new child care this would be considered a new sleep environment. Include temporary sleep environments as well su ch as a hotel stay. H1h: Pacifier use A pacifier is sometimes called a 'dummy' or a brand name, such as 'Binky'. It does not matter if the pacifier fell out during sleep, reco rd if the child was pl aced to sleep with a pacifier in his/her mouth. H1i: Child swaddled? Answer yes if the child was intentionally wr apped or swaddled in a blanket prior to putting him/her to sleep.

H1m: Child's airway Child's airway refers specifically to his/her nose, mouth or chest. Select \"Unobstructed\" if no objects were interfering with the child 's nose or mouth or compressing the child's chest. For example, mark \"Unobstructed\" if the child was on his/her back, face up, neutral neck, in a crib with no other objects obstructing airway . Select \"Fully obstructed\" if the child's nose and mouth were completely covered by an object such as face down on Data Dictionary Section H. Other Circumstances of Incident 58a pillow. \"Fully obstructed\" could also in clude a full chest compression such as a child found with an adult's thigh over his/her ches t. Select \"Partial obstruction\" if only the nose, only the mouth, or only part of the face including nose/mouth were covered by an object. \"Partial obstruction\" could also include a child that was found with only a portion of his/her chest compressed by a ca regiver or object. If airway was fully or partially obstructed, indicate what parts of the airway were partially or fully obstructed (nose, mouth, chest compressed). H1n: Objects in sleep environment in relation to airway obstruction This question presents a list of potential objects in the child's sleep environment. There are three parts to this question: Present - Inventory of object s present in the child's sleep environment. This should include an inventory of the child's sleep surface (cri b, adult bed, couch, etc). If present, describe position of object - Identify the listed obj ect(s)' position as it directly related to the child. For example, if a pillow was present, was the pillow next to the child or under the child? You may select more than one option. If present, did object obstruct airway - For each object present in the sleep environment, indicate if any of the list ed object(s) obstructed the child's nose and mouth or resulted in a chest compression. Example: Child was in crib, found under a th ick blanket with nose and mouth obstructed by blanket. Teddy bear in crib, at base of crib. Child dressed in onesie.

H3a: Type of crime If death was the consequence of a crime, i ndicate type of crime committed at time of incident. A crime is a serious offense agains t the public law. Defi nitions vary by state. Robbery/burglary : A robbery is the taking, or a ttempting to take, anything of value from another person or persons by for ce or threat of force or violence. If money or goods are stolen without for ce or threat of force (e.g., a bookkeeper stealing money from a company, thieves st ealing equipment from a loading dock), the theft is not a robbery, but larceny, and should be coded as \"Other\". A Data Dictionary Section H. Other Circumstances of Incident 60burglary is the unlawful entry into a bu ilding or other structure without the owner's consent with the intent to commit a felony or a theft. Interpersonal violence : The intentional use of physic al force or power, threatened or actual, against another pe rson, or against a group, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, d eath, psychological harm, or deprivation. Sexual assault : Sexual contact with out consent. Includes sex with a minor with or without consent. Ranges from the non-consensual touching of an intimate part of the body to forced, manipulated, or coer ced penetration. It can involve verbal coercion and threats, physical restra int, intimidation, and/or violence. Other assault : An unlawful fatal or nonfatal attack by one person upon another. To qualify as a serious crime, the assault s hould be an aggravated assault (one that involves bodily injury or th reat with a deadly weapon). Gang conflict : Gang members are persons who are members of the same association or organization which has as one of its purposes the commission of crime. Gangs include both youth gangs and organized crime organizations. Drug trade : The buying, selling or passing of dr ugs from one person to another in exchange for goods or money. Arson : To unlawfully and intentionally damage, or attempt to damage any building, real estate, or personal prop erty by fire or incendiary device.

Witness intimidation : To intentionally say or do something that would cause a witness of a crime to be fearful of harm to them if they provide information to authorities about the crime or to kill a witness to prevent him/her from providing information.Data Dictionary 61 Section I. Acts of Omission or Commission Including Child Abuse, Neglect and Suicide Completion of this Section is especially im portant because it provides information about any human behaviors that may be involved in a child's death. For ex ample, it addresses intentional (e.g., homicides, child abuse and ne glect, suicides), unint entional injuries, and medical misadventures (e.g., errors). Not only can this information serve critical data tracking functions, it may be critical to the preventi on of both intentional and unintentional injury deaths. Section I should be considered for the majority of deaths, excluding most natural deaths. I1: Did any act(s) of omission or comm ission cause and/or contribute to the death? Acts of omission or commission are defined as any act or failure to act which causes (i.e., directly) and/or substantially contributes to (i.e., indirec tly) the death of the child. Communities may have different standards that apply, but they should be based on evidence and professional judgments. Legal definitions may serve as a baseline, although they need not be used as a strict criterion. Because this question serves a gatekeeper ro le, please pay particular attention to the broad definition of act(s) of commission and omission. This is not a determination of blame, but rather just an identification of whether there were specific human behaviors involved that caused or contributed to the child's death. If one or more acts of commission or omission potentially related to the child's death are not identified and coded here, you will not be able to complete a ny other parts of the Section. In the past this has lead to some important data being omitted. A new category of \"Probable\" has been added to allow coders to include cases where there may not be sufficient evidence for the team to be certain that any particular act(s) of commission or omission related to the deat h occurred, but there is some reasonable evidence indicating such a link. Case in which the \"Probable\" category is selected will be treated separately than the cases categorized as \"Yes\". For example, this \"Probable\" category allows the team to check \"child ab use\" or \"child neglect\" in those situations where they only have reasonable suspicions, but are not certain e nough to classify the case as child maltreatment (Section I 3). Although this is not intended to be exhaustiv e, examples of acts of commission that would count as direct causes of a child's death include: 1) some one shooting the child with a gun and the bullet wound causing the deat h; 2) a teen driver falling asleep and crashing his car into a tree causing death due to blunt force trauma; 3) a caregiver shaking an infant so hard to cause severe head trau ma and death; 4) a drunk driver hitting another car causing severe trauma and death to a young child passenger in the other car; 5) a young girl taking an overdose of prescription medicines causing he r death; and 6) even an institutional breakdown in th e enforcement of DUI laws. Although this is not intended to be exhaustive, examples of acts of omission that served as contributing or indirect causes of a child 's death include: 1) an unsupervised toddler falling into an open residential pool and drowning; 2) a child left in a closed car on a hot day who dies from hyperthermia; 3) a caregiver failing to get necessa ry medical attention Section I. Acts of Omission or Commission including Poor Supervision, Child Abuse & Neglect, Assaults and Suicide Data Dictionary Section I. Acts of Omission or Commission Including Child Abuse, Neglect and Suicide 62for an ill child who died of th e untreated illness; 4) hospital personnel failing to provide the correct medicine in a timely manner that leads to patient death; 5) a caregiver who unintentionally rolls on to an infant in an adult bed and the infant suffocates. Direct or Contributing Cause of Death : The second part of the question simply asks whether the cause(s) are considered direct or contributory. Both choices can be selected if more than one act of commi ssion or omission is present. The direct cause of death refers to an act th at was the primary even t leading directly to the death. It describes a speci fic act of commission or omissi on that, in and of itself, led to the physiological processe s precipitating the ch ild's death. Generally, the act in question was both necessary and sufficient to kill the child. The death may have occurred instantaneously or substantially after the act. The contributing cause of death refers to an ac t that plays a role, but not the primary role, in the death. The contributing (or indirect) cause of death describes a necessary but not sufficient act of commission or omission that cont ributed in a substa ntial manner to the death of the child. The act did not, in and of itself, precipitate or lead inevitably to the physiological processes leading to death. Ho wever, it is understood to have been a necessary element in the child's death. The death may have occurred instantaneously or substantially after the act. I2: What act(s) caused or contributed to the death? Acts of omission or commission that caused or co ntributed to the death of child should be identified by category. Only one can be se lected for caused and one for contributed, if applicable. In addition, this is the single question that will be used to track child maltreatment cases. For the CDR purposes, chil d abuse and child negl ect are defined, at a minimum, as an act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caregiver which results in death, or presents an imminent risk of serious harm. States may have their own definitions based on these minimum standards. CDRTs also have different standards they apply, but they should be based on evidence and professional judgments. Legal definitions may serve as a baseline, although they need not be used as a strict criterion. Both a direct cause and a cont ributed cause of maltreatment can be checked (e.g., direct cause of abuse by shaking a baby and contribu ting cause of neglect by failure to protect from a known hazard). If the team judges that the caregiver behavior caused or contributed to the death but did not reach the level of maltr eatment, they should check the poor or absent supervision category. Also as mentioned in Section I1, if the team is not certain whether to classify a child death as child maltreatment, they can also use the initial question (I1) to check \"Probable\" and then check child abuse or neglect. For example, if the team can't determine whether an abandoned baby was bor n alive or stillborn, they could check the I1. Act(s) of Commission/Om ission item as \"Probable\" item as \"child abuse\" or \"child neglect\" to capture the information about the circumstances surrounding the death without having to classify the cas e as a child maltreatment death (given the question of whether it was a live birth). Data Dictionary Section I. Acts of Omission or Commission Including Child Abuse, Neglect and Suicide 63 Other negligence : Refers to acts or failures to act that are neglectful including criminal negligence, vehicular mansla ughter, voluntary in toxication, but not restricted to the level of criminal culp ability. See Item I.1. for definition of caused and contributed. Assault, not child abuse : Refers to those cases where the alleged perpetrator is not in an explicit or implicit caregiver role. Religious or cultural practices : Refer to potential mitigating factors that teams might consider in determining that the act (s) of commission or omission that lead to the child's death should not be classi fied as maltreatment. CDRTs should be free to consider these potential excep tions or not, although some states specifically allow for such religious or cultural exceptions. But primary consideration should be given to the best interests of the child and the level of risk of harm to the child. Suicide : Please select \"Caused\" and \"Suici de\" in I3 for any cases where manner of death has been marked \"Suicide\" in Section F1. Once \"Caused\" and \"Suicide\" have been selected in I3, the more detaile d suicide risk factor questions in I27 and I28 will appear in the web based Case Reporting System. Medical misadventure : A broad term that encomp asses the recognition that unintentional events or errors may occur in medical institutions or by medical practitioners. This does not refer to individual's intenti onal or unintentional misuse of medicines or medical pro cedures carried out without medical supervision. I3: Child abuse, type If death occurred as a result of child abuse, specify type of abuse as documented by law enforcement, CPS or other evidence reviewed by the team. Physical abuse is any non- accidental act that results in physical injury or the imminent risk of harm. Emotional abuse refers to such acts as verbal assault, belittling, threats and bl aming. Sexual abuse is a single or series of sexual assa ult(s) or sexual exploitation(s). I4: Type of physical abuse Check category(ies) and provide brief details. Abusive head tr auma is a broader term for any child abuse case involving head injury, including shaken baby syndrome. Chronic battered child syndrome refers to children who have undergone physical abuse multiple times that has left them with both physic al and psychological trauma. Munchausen's Syndrome by Proxy (MSP) is a parenting disord er where parents fabricate symptoms in their children, thus subjecting the child to unnecessary medical tests and/or surgical procedures, or inflict injury of children in the process. I5: For abusive head trauma, we re there retinal hemorrhages? Abusive head trauma is any injury to the h ead that was inflicted on the child. Types of abuse included here are shaken baby syndrom e with or without impact, and any other injuries inflicted to the child's head during an assault. Formal medical documentation of retinal hemorrhages is needed to code as \"yes\". I6: For abusive head traum a, was the child shaken? Data Dictionary Section I. Acts of Omission or Commission Including Child Abuse, Neglect and Suicide 64If abusive head trauma, indica te if child was shaken based on formal medical, forensic pathology, or law enforcement documentation. If child was shaken, indicate if there was or was not impact of the child's head on a surface. Impact should be documented by investigators and/or medical records. I7: Event triggering physical abuse If death occurred as a result of abuse, specify \"trigger\" for abusive behavior. Trigger is defined as an environmental circumstance or action of the child, person committing act or another person that led person to cause abuse. I8: Child neglect If death occurred as a result of neglect or neglect contributed to the death based on evidence available to the team, specify type of neglect. Check all that apply. I9: Other negligence If other type of negligence was documented as a contributing factor in death, specify. Does not include child neglect. I10: Was act(s) of omission/commission? Chronic with child refers to a pattern of ongoing acts of abuse or negligence inflicted specifically on this child. A pattern in family or with perpetrator refers to a pattern of ongoing acts of abuse or negligence inflicted on one or more members of a family or household.

Code as 'yes' if person was noted as using illegal dr ugs (such as heroin or cocaine), abusing prescription medications (such as pain reliev ers or Valium), or regularly using inhalants (e.g., sniffing gas). If the person is mentioned a using illegal drugs ev en if addiction or abuse in not specifically mentioned code as 'Y es'. A person who is noted as participating in a drug or alcohol rehabili tation program or treatment including self-help groups and 12-step program should be coded as \"yes\" even if the person was noted as being currently clean and sober. A person w ith short-term experimental use that did not cause life problems and/or addictions should be coded \"no\". A problem from the past (e.g. five years or more ago) that has resolved and no longer appears to apply should still be coded \"yes\". Previously attempting suicide via overdose is not sufficient justification for answering \"y es\" to this question in the absence of other information.

L8: Describe the factor(s) that di rectly contributed to this death: This is a subjective question and asks which factors the team feels directly and more immediately contributed to this child's death. For example, it is more important to note in this question that the infant was sleeping on soft pillows at the time of death rather listing previous history of substance abuse by the caregiver or inadequate prenatal care, both of which were risk factors that were less immediate (more distal) to the death. Data Dictionary Section L. The Review Meeting Process 76Only include factors that are relevant to th e infant death. If the mother was bedsharing with the infant and the mother was obese, obe sity may be a contribu ting factor. However, if the mother was obese and infant was not sleeping with mother at the time of death, obesity did not contribute to this death. Other examples may include: prone sleep position, bed sharing, heavy bla nket obstructing nose and mout h, prematurity, respiratory infection, using alcohol while operating a motor vehicle, lack of supervision at family pool. L9: Which of the factors that directly c ontributed to this death are modifiable? This is a subjective question and asks the team what factors listed in L8 were able to be changed. Removing pillows from the infant's sleep environment or changing the infant sleep position from prone to supine are examples of modifiable risk factors that could be listed here . Other modifiable examples may include : bedsharing, not putting baby to sleep in crib/bassinette, sleep pos ition, propping a bottle, noncompl iance with medications, not wearing a seat belt in motor vehicle. L10: List any recommendations to prevent deat hs from similar causes or circumstances in the future. Record the recommendations the team devel oped in order to prev ent similar deaths. Work hard with your team to develop recomm endations that are f easible and specific. Recommendations should include changes to practices, policies, and procedures, as well as maintenance of current prevention activities. Suggesting all parents should be educated is neither feasible nor specific. Rather, suggesting targeted safe sleep messages through home visiting or during the hospita l stay following delivery is a better recommendation. Other examples include: Trai n 100% of ABC Daycar e staff on Safe to Sleep campaign; create a Safe to Sleep checkli st for home visitors; initiate a car safety seat inspection at Kids Elementary School. L11: What additional inform ation would the team like to know about the death scene investigation? Record the team's questions pertaining to th e death scene investig ation which were not answered during the review.
