Melanie Whitter, Stacia Murphy, Rebecca Tregerman, and Kenneth Morford, of Abt Associates, developed the study concept. Allan Rivlin and Julia Kurnik of Hart Research Associates moderated the study focus groups and conducted the individual in-depth interviews (IDIs). Additionally, Abt Associates and Hart Research analyzed the focus group results and IDI findings for this report. Both organizations would like to thank the participants in this study for their rich contributions to the focus groups and IDIs. Their input provided valuable data for the preparation of this report. Additionally, the confidential recruitment process required the involvement of extensive professional and social networks. This undertaking would not have been possible without the support of many dedicated individuals. This report was prepared for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration/Center for Substance Abuse Treatment Partners for Recovery Initiative. Shannon B. Taitt, M.P.A., served as the Government Project Officer. Disclaimer In market research, focus groups and individual interviews seek to develop insight and direction rather than quantitatively precise or absolute measures. Qualitative research identifies issues of concern to specific populations, which in turn helps to further develop questions about the topic, which can then be used to derive quantitative data through survey development. Focus group and interview research is intended to provide a first step in determining knowledge, awareness, attitudes, and opinions concerning services, concepts, or products. As the results of this study will indicate, focus groups often identify issues that others may not have previously considered, or the focus group results may suggest framing questions differently. Findings from focus groups and interviews should be considered valid from the participants' point of view, but not generalizable to a given population. A focus group is not a statistically significant representation of a population, but rather a group of individuals selected from the population being studied, the intent being to understand issues of concern to that population. Consequently, the study cannot be considered statistically reliable, because technically the sampling cannot be replicated, identical questions cannot be asked in each group and interview, and the results of one group/interview cannot be compared precisely with the results of other groups/interviews; they can only be added to the body of knowledge on the investigated topic. The views and opinions expressed in this publication are those of the authors and study participants and do not necessarily reflect the views, opinions, or policies of SAMHSA or Health and H uman Services Administration (HHS ).

Focus groups and individual in - depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted to provide greater insight into and perspective on the process of recovery from addiction to alcohol and other drugs. The study specifically seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the recovery process ; to explore the terminology that individuals in recovery use to describe their own processes ; to become more knowledgeable about the range of recovery pathways ; and t o more fully understand the barriers to successful recovery and the influences that support it. Methods. Four focus groups were held, with a total of 24 participants across all four groups. In addition, nine IDIs were conducted, for a total of 33 participants. Individuals were screened to recruit two study groups: a younger adults group, ages 18 -30, and an adults group, ages 31 and over. Participants were required to have had a history of alcohol problems, drug problems, or both, and to have been maintaining a healthy lifestyle for no less than six months. The study recruited individuals who had used traditional and/or non-traditional therapies and supports to achieve their healthy lifestyles. Each focus group lasted approximately two hours. Participants were paid $75 to cover their time and travel costs. The focus group participants were led through the discussion in a topic- by-topic format, with the opportunity for general discussion and a more in- depth conversation on specific topics. Terminology: \" addiction\" is a commonly used term , and \"recovery\" is widely understood and accepted. Notwithstanding extensive efforts to allow participants to define the terms of the discussion related to their history of alcohol and other drug problems and their current status, addiction and recovery emerged as the most commonly used words. Addiction emerged as the word used by most individuals to define a dependence on a substance, although some described addiction as a clinical term. While the term recovery was widely understood and accepted to describe when someone has overcome a dependency, some individuals did not associate themselves with the term nor use it. The term recovery was familiar and comfortable f or individuals whose pathways were 12- step-based and who had participated in either mutual aid groups or treatment programs based in 12-step traditions. Those who chose non- 12-step-based methods (e.g., natural recovery, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or addiction energy healing) often preferred o ther terms such as quit, healed, and the past tense form of the word: recovered . Participants provided rich descriptions of the experiences they associated with each of t hese terms. Addiction. Descriptions of addiction often focus ed on a feeling of being out of control, and involved accounts of trauma and pain, unhealthy behavior, lying to both oneself and others, and self-loathing. Participants often related feeling a sense of loneliness and despair while in the throes of their addiction. Working Draft Page 2 Recovery. In contrast, recovery was described as having control of one's life, being honest with oneself and others, and experiencing independence and happiness. Many said that managing their disease is a daily struggle, but they are now in control of their lives rather than being controlled by their addiction. Honesty and responsibility are important aspects of the recovery process. Many said they had to take responsibility for themselv es and their behavior before they could attain wellness. Themes of health and healing emerged from most accounts of an individual's recovery process. Differing views were expressed on whether one must abstain from alcohol in order to be in recovery. The majority of participants believed one must abstain from alcohol and other drugs to be in recovery, but a minority believed it is possible to drink moderately. This group was largely made up of young er adults who did not view 12-step programs as their primary pathway to recovery. Some explored alternative pathways and s aw themselves as healed . Others described themselves as in recovery from particular substance(s) that they were addicted to (e.g., cocaine, prescription medications, methamphetamines), and said that because their addiction did not include alcohol they are able to drink moderately with friends and family and maintain their recovery. Recovery pathways. In discussing the recovery process, participants mention ed a variety of pathways: Natural recovery Mutual aid groups, 12-step based programs (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) Mutual aid groups, non- 12-step based programs, (e.g., Women for Sobriety, and SMART Recovery) Faith-based recovery Cultural recovery (e.g., traditional Native American sweat lodges) Criminal justice (e.g., incarceration, drug court) Outpatient treatment Inpatient treatment Bodywork (e.g., yoga, traditional Chinese medicine, and Addiction Energy Healing) Other therapies (e.g., art or music) and giving back Multiple pathways. While some participants sa id they used only one of the pathways listed above, the majority used two or more pathways on their road to recovery, both concurrently and sequentially. Each must f ind the \" right\" pathway. One of the most important lessons to emerge during the discussion of pathways is the importance of finding the right pathway or pathways for the individual. Many discuss ed trying multiple methods to address their addiction, and failing, often several times, before they found the pathway that work ed for them. Working Draft Page 3 Most participants explained that the r ight pathway frequently involves participation in both traditional and non-traditional services and supports over many years, or, for some individuals, over a lifetime. Complex views of 12-step based programs. The discussion of the importance of finding the right pathway revealed widely differing and complex views on 12-step programs. Because of the widespread availability of these programs, nearly all of the participants have attended a meeting at some point. While many participants have f ound 12-step programs essential to their recovery, others have felt excluded by the program, or felt a lack of personal connection with the program and participants. Barriers and supports to effective recovery. Participants list ed numerous barriers and supports encountered during the recovery process. A barrier for one person, such as the police and criminal justice system, was a support for another. Moreover, in many cases a participant listed the same entity, such as family or friends, as both a barrier at one point and a support later in the individual's recovery. One of the most significant barriers participants repeatedly stressed was the lack of services and support options. They said they often struggled over years and decades to find the right pathways before achieving recovery. Messages and insights for the public and policymakers. Participants felt that the public and policymakers lack an understanding of addiction and recovery from alcohol and other drugs. They would like to see a richer understanding of the issues that are critical in recovery, including the importance of treatment options in lieu of incarceration, and the importance of reducing discrimination by educating the public and policymakers about the disease of addiction. They also stressed the importance of prevention to reduce the likelihood of this disease occurring in future generations. Above all, participants expressed gratitude that they were able to achieve recovery, and believe that with the right support others can also obtain long- term recovery. Working Draft Page 4 Purpose The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA's) Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) undertook a qualitative study t o gain greater insight into and perspective on recovery from addiction to alcohol and other drugs. Limited research has been conducted to date on the population in recovery. This lack of data inhibits our understanding and our ability to respond most effectively to those trying to attain recovery. From the standpoint of science, little is known about what contributed to the success of individuals who are now leading healthy and fulfilling lives, and the barriers they experienced in their recovery process es. This study was conducted to begin to better understand the complex process of recovery among different individuals, including those that used traditional and non-traditional pathways. Focus groups and in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted to gather data on individuals' healing/recovery processes. The specific objectives of the study are as follows : 1) To achieve a better understanding of the recovery process. 2) To explore the terminology that individuals in recovery use to describe their processes. 3) To become more knowledgeable about the range of recovery pathways. 4) To more fully understand the barriers to successful recovery and the influences that support it. IRB Approval Abt Associates established a study protocol for approval by the company 's Institutional Review Board (IRB) to ensure that the study met the standards for informed consent and confidentiality and other standards for research on human subjects. The IRB reviewed and approved the focus group protocol and related materials, including recruiting procedures, the invitation letter, informed-consent forms, and the moderator guide. Working Draft Page 5 Methods To recruit the participants for the groups and also respect privacy, Abt Associates used a network of contacts and confidential referrals to reach a diverse group of potential participants. A screening process was used to recruit two study groups: a younger adults group, ages 18-30, and an adults group, ages 31 and over. Participants were required to have had a history of alcohol problems, drug problems, or both, and to have been maintaining a healthy lifestyle for no less than six months. To ensure rich and broad perspectives on problems with alcohol and other drugs and on recovery, the study recruit ed individuals who had used traditional and /or non-traditional therapies and supports to achieve their healthy lifestyles. Once individuals were screened in, Abt Associates provided a list of their names for Hart Research Associates to use to formally invite them to the focus groups. Initial welcome letters and e-mails were sent, followed by a phone call to confirm participation. Before each focus group began, participants signed consent forms agreeing to voluntarily participate in the study. Through the screening process, 24 participants were selected for the four focus groups. The groups were divided by participants' location s and ages. Two groups were held in New York, NY, on June 30, 2009, one for the younger adults, ages 18-30, and one for the 31- and-over group; and two were held on August 12, 2009, in Albany, NY, also divided by age group. Each focus group lasted about two hours, and was audio-recorded, with participants' permission. Participants were paid $75 to cover their time and travel costs associated with attending the group. Those traveling out of State were compensated for hotel and gas or airline costs. Many of the focus group participants traveled substantial distances to participate in the sessions. In all, 11 States were represented in the focus groups and individual IDIs: California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Allan Rivlin from Hart Research Associates moderated the four focus groups. He led the groups through the discussion topic by topic, but allowed the conversation to open in different directions taken by participants. The groups opened with a general discussion on the issues, and then the topics narrowed as Mr. Rivlin guided the participants through specific questions aimed to elicit information about their personal experiences and opinions. In addition to the four groups, Hart Research Associates also conducted nine individual IDIs by telephone. These interviews included respondents who were unable to attend the focus groups due to timing or location, and were conducted following the focus groups. Each IDI took 20 to 30 minutes, and was tape- recorded with participants' signed consent. These discussions followed the same general outline that the focus groups used, and were also conducted in a topic- by-topic format. Working Draft Page 6 Participant Demographics Study participants were asked to fill out a brief questionnaire on their demographics and pathway(s) to recovery and healing following the focus groups and IDIs. The table below presents this information where available, including age, race, profession, education, and income, as well as their pathway(s), and years in recovery/healed. The table includes additional pathways that were reported on the questionnaire but were not discussed during the focus groups and IDIs. Participants were asked to list the top three services that contributed to their success. The services are listed in the Pathway(s) column in the order reported by the participants. A total of 18 different pathways were cited on the questionnaire s.

Participant s' ages ranged from 18 to 70+ . Individuals represented different religious and ethnic backgrounds, including Black, Hispanic/ Latino, American Indian, and White. They also resided in different geographic areas of the country, representing 11 States. The participants were diverse in terms of socioeconomic status and profession; their current occupations included cab driver, legal aide, therapist, educator, and corporate executive. They had been addicted to different substances, used different pathways in their recovery process, and had been in recovery for lengths of time varying from six months to over 30 years. Definitions of Terms A great deal of effort went into eliciting and exploring the terminology the participants used to describe their histories with alcohol and other drug problems and their current status. The most common terms tha t emerged as appropriate and without prompting from the moderator were addiction and recovery . While these terms were used most frequently and generally understood, they were not the first choice for everyone, as explained below, and this was particularly true of the term recovery. After terms are defined in this section, the Descriptions of Experiences section will describe the emotion al and physical aspects of addiction. Addiction Most participants agreed that addiction is the most appropriate t erm to describe a dependence on a substance and the inability to control that dependence, and when probed further they offer ed the following descriptive terms: Sick Disgusting/disgusted Pain Self-destructive Suffering Cheating Afraid Rebellious Out-of-control Dependent Disaster Obsessive Extremist Self-centered Coward Lost/Lacking purpose Manipulative Insane Some participants viewed the word addiction as a clinical term, and provided the additional terms listed above to explain the experience of dependence on alcohol and other drugs. The key themes that emerged were pain and suffering, despair, dishonesty, self-centeredness, self-loathing, and lacking purpose and control over one's life. Working Draft Page 9 \"I dont think Ive ever used the term r ecovered. I dont believe that youre ever recovered ... I feel that youre always recovering.\" - Nursing School Student, IL Recovery While discussin g addiction, participants described their lack of control, low self- esteem, loneliness, and dependence. In discussing recovery they described a process of realization and healing. Participants largely agreed that recovery is an appropriate term to describe the triumph over addiction. The participants generally underst ood the term recovery and no one was offended by its use. However, some did not associate themselves with the word and did not use it. For those who did use the term recovery , there were differing opinions on what it meant. Participants list ed many terms for what it means to no longer be addicted. These terms allow ed them to explain the struggle and the change that occurred in their lives: Sober Stopped Recovered Clean and dry Okay Great Happy Healed Self-aware/sense of self-worth Goal-oriented Enlightened Peace Equilibrium Mature Changed Balance Control Healing Relaxed Proud Free Connected Participants who primarily used 12-step based programs were more likely to immediately identify with the term recovery but to strongly resist use of the past-tense construction recovered. As illustrated in the quote above, individuals often identify recovery as an ongoing process and therefore do not identify themselves as recovered. Those participants who had participated largely in 12-step based programs described their disease as in remission, with the lifelong potential for relapses . In contrast, many of the participants who preferred programs outside of the 12-step tradition such as natural recovery, yoga, faith, and energy healing felt comfortable with the term recovered. They often also described themselves as healed or having quit. They view ed their disease as in the past and no longer directly affecting their present life. As one young adult explain ed, I would say I'm healed. I wouldn't say I'm in recovery. I'm just a completely different person. Working Draft Page 10 \"Addiction is like death. It was a very slow and painful death until the point where I lost everything.\" - Addiction Counselor, N C \"Recovery is not about what I dont do; its about what I do.\" -Communications Specialist, NY \"As a kid I found drugs and it worked for me for a while. But after everyone else had stopped [using drugs] I was still partying ... I knew my life had spiraled out of control until I was compromising not just my belief system but my integrity and my career.\" -Cab Driver, CA Descriptions of Experiences Addiction Addiction was described in many ways, but a common theme associated with the disease was loss of control. One male respondent from New York City (NYC) explain ed, I was not self-sufficient whatsoever ... I had absolutely no way of expressing my own feelings or dealing with life's speed bumps. I resorted to drugs to make me feel better. Feelings of pain and an inability to cope reverber ated strongly in all of the focus groups and interviews when addiction was being described. When asked to explain what it was like to be addicted, some spoke of a downward spiral that eventually led them to steal and lie to support their addictions. One young woman explained that she had routinely taken money from her mother's wallet to pay for drugs. A young man shared the fact that he had put his family in harm's way by taking them to the worst areas of his city to find drugs. Others admitted to feelings of disgust, contributing to their overwhelming loneliness and self-hatred. Although pain, lack of control, and lack of self-esteem were quick to emerge as a common thread through nearly all of the experiences of addiction, not everyone's experience involved a downward spiral into poor functioning . One woman explained that while she was in the throes of her addiction she also successful ly served as the vice president of a group of four corporations. Her struggle involved hiding her addiction from her direct boss \u2014the president and owner of the company \u2014and at the same time maintaining her performance at work. As a complicating factor, her boss did not support addictions treatment, and expected her to remove any employees with drug problems from the company. Knowing his views made her condition all the more difficult to deal with. It was only through the support of her husband that she was able to seek help. Recovery Participants described recovery or being recovered as a feeling of: being in control; changing; becoming self-aware, independent, and/or happy; and healing or becoming healed. The discussion concentrated on the positive feelings, experiences, and actions that become part of people 's lives when they are no longer misusing substances. Participants explain ed that recovery is about continual forward growth and engagement, leading a positive life, and engaging in rewarding relationships with Working Draft Page 11 \"It creeps back in, that thought, maybe I can just drink. Maybe it was all a phase. Maybe, I never really had a problem [but I know I cannot drink].\" -Facilities Manager, CT family and friends, as well as making positive career moves and taking an interest in activities. For many it is about changing one's lifestyle and establishing a new way of thinking and living. Several participants explained that recovery and healing involve facing difficult personal issues, and not only being honest with others but also being honest with oneself. The healing process begins with recognizing the addiction in order to deal with it and move forward in life. Participants generally agreed on these central themes, but differences arose when the discussion turn ed to the place of alcohol in recovery. The majority of participants expressed the belief that an essential part of recovery is no longer using alcohol and other drugs, but a minority said that they have recover ed from the substance(s) they were addicted to (e.g., prescription medications , methamphetamines, cocaine), and drink alcohol moderately. For these participants alcohol had never been their drug of choice . They believed they could drink moderately and maintain their recovery, with their recovery being evidenced by the changes occurring in their lives , e.g., buying a house, being engaged in artistic endeavors, starting a family, and helping others not take the same path they did. Individuals who participated in a 12-step program, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA), fe lt particularly strong ly about abstinence from all drugs and alcohol to maintain recovery. Many could immediately name the number of days that had passed since their last use of alcohol or other drugs, even if it had been three or more decades. The difference in opinion over the use of alcohol in recovery was largely between age groups. Many participants from the young er adult age group stated that one could be in recovery from illicit and prescription drug use while still consuming alcohol on occasion. A young woman in the NYC group, now in her mid-twenties and with a history of teenage cocaine use, work ed as a bartender in upstate New York and explained it this way: I wouldn't say I'm sober' because I still go out. I still drink now. I'm just a completel y different person ... I guess I could say in a clinical sense that I've relapsed, but I can't look at my life like that. Participants agreed that while the process and end result might vary, recovery means that individuals are now in control of their lives and functioning in a manner that gives them satisfaction and improved health. Pathways The recruitment process was designed to find people who had experience with diverse pathways to recovery, including traditional and non-traditional pathways. The desired diversity of pathways was found, but as the focus groups and interviews were conducted, the list of pathways that individuals participated in grew in length and variety. The pathways used by the focus group and IDI participants include the following: Natural recovery Mutual aid groups, 12-step based programs (e.g., AA, NA) Working Draft Page 12 \"Im a product of AA for 32 years. I know it works. I see miracles every day. Alcoholism is a lonely disease, very lonely, and AA provides a fellowship for men and women.\" - Substance Abuse Counselor, NY Mutual aid groups , non-12-step based programs (e.g., Women for Sobriety, SMART Recovery) Faith-based recovery Cultural recovery (e.g., traditional Native American sweat lodges) Criminal justice (e.g., incarceration, drug court) Outpatient treatment Inpatient treatment Bodywork (e.g., yoga, traditional Chinese medicine, and Addiction Energy Healing) Other therapies (e.g., art or music) and giving back Participants frequently spoke of the need to find the right pathway, because what works for some may not work for others. Several sa id they tried many methods to end their addiction before finding a method or methods that worked for them. Natural Recovery Natural recovery is a pathway that do es not include formal therapy and a designated support system. A few of the participants (9%) cited their pathway as natural. In natural recovery a person stops using alcohol or other drugs on his or her own. In describing this pathway participants often discussed the support of friends and family, and the value of education. One male participant explain ed, I stopped drinking because I told myself I was going to stop drinking, but nobody came along the next day and challenged me by doing something that would cause me to have a drink. He sa id that although he was never in a formal recovery program he had a strong informal support group of former drinkers, who encouraged him to quit drinking . Communication helped ... being able to talk ... with a group of people who understood what I was experiencing . Although he succeeded in stopping on his own and refraining from a relapse, he still said that it was largely due to the people around him. He reported that quitting drinking was less of a struggle for him than quitting smoking, which continued to be a challenge. Mutual A id Groups ( 12-Step-based programs) Twelve-step based mutual aid programs, including AA and NA, constituted one of the recovery pathways most frequently cited by participants . A significant percentage of the partcipants ( 45%) cited 12- step based programs as important to their recovery. Twelve-step mutual aid programs are based on the 12 principles of Alcoholic Anonymous, and have been adapted for many other substances and behaviors. Examples of the 12 steps include: Step 1) admit that one is powerless over one's addiction; Step 2) accept the premise that a power greater than oneself could restore one's sanity; and Step 3) decide to turn one's will and li fe over to this higher power. The programs are based on a fellowship where men and women share their personal experiences to support one another, and follow a 12-step program to guide Working Draft Page 13 \"Its wonde rful for women because its such a positive program. It met my needs and built my self -esteem.\" -Counselor, NJ them to sobriety by looking to a higher power . Most participants had attended a 12- step program for at least a short period of time to aid them in their recovery, and others had relied nearly exclusively on AA or other 12-step based programs for their recovery over many years. An adult NYC participant explain ed his source of support in times of need as follows. I just want to go back to AA because AA is a simple program for complicated people. It's individualized ... I don't think anybody can get sober without AA. Participants cited AA and other 12-step based programs as an extraordinarily important and useful pathway , and particularly not ed the fellowship such programs offer. Other participants fe lt that 12-step based programs made them uncomfortable and could be judgmental. One woman said that when she attended meetings she was made to feel weak and guilty for drinking. She explain ed, [AA] can be almost like a trap of weakness, that it's my fault, or that I'm bad. Others echoed the idea that AA can be too strict, particularly in its view that participant s who have experienced a relapse must sta rt counting their recovery all over. A handful of participants point ed out that AA and other 12-step based programs can also create dependence on the program; some people, even those who found success through mutual aid groups, are reluctant to ever stop attending meetings for fear that without the program they will not be able to maintain the progress they have achieved. Mutual Aid Groups (Non- 12-Step based programs) Participants discussed the value of non- 12-step-based mutual aid groups, such as Women for Sobriety and SMART Recovery. A few of the participants ( 9%) view non- 12 step based programs as instrumental to their healing process. There are many other non- 12-step-based mutual aid programs, including Life Ring Secular Recovery and Secular Organization for Sobriety/Save Our Selves (SOS). These programs differ by not using the 12 steps as a foundation for their teaching s, instead using other core elements t o assist individuals in abstaining from substances . Women for Sobriety Women for Sobriety is designed specifically for women to help them with alcoholism and other addictions. The program is based on 13 affirmations that promote emotional and spiritual awareness tailored to the psychological needs of women. One woman, who had found 12-step based programs too rigid, felt that she would not have overcome her addictions without Women for Sobriety. The program helped her to develop a plan and to write a contract with herself. Wh en she attended group meetings, they concentrated on building her self-esteem and working toward her goals. Each morning she is renewed by reciting the affirmations she developed in the program. Working Draft Page 14 \"When I found faith it said to find the truth and I could be free ... When I came to the Lord, all of the past was old ... It molded me into a stronger person by drawing on past experience. I have peace now .\" -Addiction Counselor, NC \"SMART Recovery has helped me because I am a free thinker who is more oriented to understand addiction in logical and behavioral terms rather th an spiritual or disease terms.\" - Social Worker, NY SMART Recovery Another successful program for participants is SMART Recovery, a secular approach based on a 4-Point Program comprising : 1) enhancing and maintaining motivation; 2) coping with urges; 3) problem-solving; and 4) lifestyle balance. Participants valued the focus on cognitive therapy in this mutual aid group, and the smaller size of the program. This smaller size has enabled program participa nts to make social connections over the years and to volunteer for leadership roles to expand the organization. Study participants also felt they benefited from the program's logic-based approach to understanding addiction. Faith-Based Recovery Faith and spirituality are a factor in many pathways; 21% of the participants said that faith in a higher power was the main path to overcoming their addictions. Participants often relied on religious organizations in their communities. Some returned to their religions and others became religious for the first time to help them with their addiction . The idea of finding inner strength is at the core of why some people find success through faith. Their connection with a greater purpose and a spiritual or religious force provides the support to overcome their addiction. Participants often explain ed that faith provides a source of peace, comfort, and acceptance that helps to alleviate the pain associated with addiction. Religion was often cited as a critical support. As one example, an Albany participant said, I was a manipulator, and it dug a hole [in] my life. As I began to read the Word, what Jesus spoke, I began to see my faults. I said, that's why I'm in this hole. My thinking was contrary to [the Word]. The Word works for me, and it transformed my thinking. While embracing faith is fundamental to this particular pathway , many of the underlying themes of healing through faith resonated among participants who did not use faith at all. Finding inner strength, facing one's personal demons, and being empowered are experiences that were widely acknowledged among all participants. Cultural Recovery A few ( 6%) of the participants spoke about how culture, specifically traditional Native American culture and Chinese m edicine work, served as a pathway for them. The Native American pathway to recovery includes many spiritual and cultural norms that must be followed. A young adult explained: What we're taught is we're not able to dance, we're not able to go to sun dances, we're not able to go to ceremonies, we're not able to smudge, we're not able to hold an eagle feather if we're using [alcohol and using drugs]. We have to be [abstinent] Working Draft Page 15 \"Putting people in jail for drugs and alcohol really doesnt work. You have to have some kind of treatment program and provide supports after they get out.\" -Counselor, NY because these are sacred items. The se spiritual suppo rts\u2014the use of cultural items and the prohibition of others, such as the eagle feather \u2014helped this woman on her way to recovery. For her, the support of her community and the importance of her culture provided a natural and effective pathway. Other participants found cultural supports to be pivotal to their recovery process even if the support was not originally part of their culture. One woman used Chinese medicine work as a pathway that was outside her heritage. Additionally, sweat lodges, a traditional Native American ritual, can be very helpful to non-Native Americans on their road to recovery. At a traditional sweat lodge people gather in a tent outside of which rocks are first heated in a fire and then brought in one by one; water is then poured over the rocks to create steam that fills the tent, making everyone in the tent sweat. One woman reported that although she attended AA meetings and support groups, the sweat lodge is what really allowed her to overcome her addiction. Criminal Justice Twelve percent of the participants stated recovery began with an arrest and incarceration. The judicial process is a pathway lauded by some but seen as a barrier by others. Often the way people viewed this process depend ed on their incarceration experiences. One woman said she had been arrested many time s and spent short stints in jail before finding an effective pathway. Although arrest and incarceration were described as barriers, many participants stated that being arrested was where they hit rock bottom, and the impetus for getting help. Participants who received detoxification and treatment services and/or participated in a mutual aid group while incarcerated tended to have a more positive view of the criminal justice system. A male in the Albany group described a positive experience with a 90-bed therapeutic community while incarcerated. Inmates in the program follow ed strict rules, including a structured schedule and specific work tasks. He felt that the program enabled them to learn personal responsibility and build their self-worth. A couple of participants discussed drug courts as instrumental in supporting their recovery. They felt that this alternative to incarceration provided therapeutic support and emphasized personal accountability . They stated that increasing the availability o f these recovery programs would reduce alcohol and drug use and the rate of recidivism for drug-related offenses. \"Id wake up the next morning feeling like a load had been taken off me, literally. I kept going back because it was such a welcoming place. People didnt care what Id done or what drugs Id [taken]. It ... became spiritual for me.\" - Customer Service Representative, CA Working Draft Page 16 \"I think a year was good for me. Going into it was scary, because I was on my own ... but I think that it was spot on. \" -Real Estate Agent, CT \"I think its important ... to receive as much therapy as possible to understand why we drank. Because once we understand and get to the root of those things, once we put those issues away, it helps us not continue.\" -Corporate VP, PA While many participants consider ed incarceration and drug courts helpful, others were quick to point out the consequences of incarceration and involvement with the criminal justice system. Participants mentioned that a criminal record can make acceptance back into society extremely difficult. Individuals with a criminal record often have a hard time getting a good job and earning the right to be trusted. These experiences can be significant barriers to staying in recovery. Outpatient Treatment Some participants ( 9%) referenced outpatient services as their pathway. There was near unanimous agreement that recovery involves a mental shift gaining, control, self-esteem, and strength. Several participants discuss ed the importance of understanding the why behind their addiction. One woman in an NYC group put it this way: I think that a very critical point in my journey, which was a pretty medicinal journey, is the question why?' Why are you doing this? She fe lt that she had to truly delve into the why side of her addiction in order to overcome her harmful behaviors. This theme was reiterated by many participants in the focus groups. Inpatient Treatment Inpatient treatment varies widely in terms of duration, recovery philosophy, and degree of structure. Participants described residential programs with variable lengths of stay and treatment approaches; therapeutic communities that use participa tive, group - based approaches ; and halfway houses, which provide a combination of treatment and housing support. A couple of the younger participants describe d the extended (i.e., 12 months ) length of their inpatient treatment experience as a key element of their success. They felt that a minimum of a year is required to maintain a healthy lifestyle , saying that people need adequate time in treatment to adjust to the healing process if they are to sustain improvement . The participants also discussed the importance of having access to psychiatrists, support groups, and a strong support structure to promote lasting wellness. One woman who was addicted to crack and heroin reported that receiving methadone and therapy was vital to her recovery. She said, Therap y was really important to me. It helped uncover more of you, get rid of the pain, the guilt and reach for something new when I had nothing. She felt that without the psychiatric support she received from doctors at the halfway house she would not have been able to overcome her addiction. Inpatient treatment was a valuable pathway for many because it provided the therapeutic structure and time they needed to get better. It also provided a range of medical, therapeutic, and social supports necessary for their recovery. Working Draft Page 17 \"In the good [treatment] programs people want to be sober, you have rules, you have curfew, you go to meetings. You hold each other accountable. You care about each ot her and that helps you stay sober.\" -Bartender, GA Inpatient treatment varies in degree of structure, but most participants agreed that a certain amount of structure within inpatient treatment is helpful. However, what works for some people may not work for others. Although the majority of participants agreed that an element of structure is helpful, others found it stifling. One young woman explain ed that when she first entered a rehabilitation facility she felt as though the people running the program did not understand her. The program 's strict rules felt confining to her. Since she was unable to relate to the program she did not find it helpful to her personally, and it became a barrier to her recovery. Most participants who were treated in an inpatient facility stated the value of immediate and continual support systems. One young male participant sa id that he attended mutual aid meetings while admitted to an inpatient program. Through these meetings he was able to connect with other patients and move towards recovery. When he left the facility the connections he had made with others provided him a strong, ongoing support system and helped him maintain a successful recovery. Bodywork Twenty-one percent of the participants used bodywork, including yoga, meditation, traditional Chinese medicine, and Addiction Energy Healing to aid in their healing process . For these participants, different types of bodywork taught relaxation and other techniques that allowed them to overcome a physical need for substances, while meditation and reflective thinking often provided greater insight. Yoga One woman told of overcoming her addictions, and her subsequent ability to achieve sustained recovery through yoga. She explain ed that while AA and medication helped with her addiction, at least in taking the first steps, yoga helped her achieve a healthy lifestyle and refrain from relapsing. Yoga helped her find a mental balance that did not exist before, and a calmness and stability in her life. Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese medicine includes various relaxation and physical health practices \u2014for example, herbal medicine, acupuncture, and qigong , a breathing technique used to relax the mind and body. Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine believe the roots of disease stem from the organs and the health of bodily tissue. One younger participant who described her experience with traditional Chinese medicine sa id, I believe traditional Chinese medicine provides physiological explanations for addiction and other behaviors , correlating it to vari ous organs and how well they function. Working Draft Page 18 \"One of my early sponsors played flute, and suggested I get sober with my flute in my hand.\" -Legal Proofreader, NY \"I dont know how to articulate it, but for me, it was my treatment because I worked with an energy person. She changed my energy and the addiction disappeared. After 11 years, you dont ever look back.\" -Master Electrician, MA Addiction Energy Healing (the Lenair Technique) The Lenair Technique, also known as the Self(S)-Healing Experience, is one form of addiction energy healing. Those who have successfully used this method stated that energy was used for healing purposes and their addiction disappeared almost immediately. The process involves three sessions. The first session is approximately an hour and is an introduction to the experience. The individual begins the process by understanding what is blocking their ability to heal. The second session moves into the process of eliminating any obstacles (e.g., triggers, vulnerability, etc.) that are still pending. The third session is intended to resolve any remaining issues that have not been cleared in the first two sessions. A follow-up session is held via phone within one to three months after the last session. Participants who have used this method do not consider themselves in recovery. They simply do not have a desire to use alcohol and drugs any longer. Individuals communicate a changed lifestyle as a result of the healing method. Although they had difficulty explaining the mechanics of the method, they believed the factors that caused their drug use had been addressed and that they had been healed. They had been relieved of stress and anxiety. Clients said that after years of addiction they now experience a total absence of desire for drug use and have never felt happier. Other pathways used in conjunction with this method include cognitive-behavioral therapy and physician-assisted methods. Other Therapies and Giving Back Participants also used a variety of alternative methods/therapies that involve creative expression in their recovery . For some, art or music was important to their understanding and healing. One participant found that continuing her creative writing, though difficult, helped her overcome her addiction. This experience proved so powerful, she explain ed, that she now helps others achieve healing and recovery while using their own creative abilities. She fe lt that it is very important to continue these expressions of creativity while recovering. Other participants spoke of giving back as a pathway. They explain ed that community service and helping individuals with alcohol and drug problems allows them to make a positive contribution to society. Knowing that they are helping others keeps them grounded and therefore serves as a great aid on their own pathway to recovery. Working Draft Page 19 \"Through AA, I learned how to look at other modalities and accept them because we are all individuals, and we all got sober differently.\" -Counselor, NY \"One size does not fit all. You must have options to fit you at different stages, options appropriate to your age, your background, where you are in your recovery path; you may need different things when youre 22 than when youre 40.\" -Social Worker, NY Combinations of Pathways An important theme that emerged during the discussions is that most people (78%) have u sed multiple pathways in their effort t o achieve wellness. While some participants ( 21%) primarily used a single pathway, the large majority of participants used two to five pathways. M any described trying one method and failing, perhaps several times, until a treatment or combination of treatments, methods, and supports led to a breakthrough in long-term recovery or healing. One method was effective in aiding one part of their recovery, while another method helped address another aspect. It was the combination of multiple programs and multiple support systems that eventually worked in treating their addiction. As one participant explain ed, It took me everything! Combinations of pathways were used in a linear fashion by some, and others used multiple pathways simultaneously. Sometimes a pathway was useful initially in the recovery process and another was more helpful at a later point. Often, a range of services and supports are needed over a period of time. As an individual's condition changes and improves , the person's needs will also change. For instance, one participant said that while he needed inpatient care to start the process and treat the symptoms of addiction, it was the assistance of a longer- term mutual aid program that allowed him to recover. As with other chronic diseases, the treatment and management of addiction to alcohol and other drugs requires a long-term response using a number of methods. Finding the Right Pathway Although participants expressed that a combination of pathways may lead to healing or recovery, the likelihood of success is increased and the recovery process shortened if the pathway(s) are individualized. Many individuals try the wrong pathway one, two, three, four, or more times before achieving a state of long-term recovery. Different avenues work for different people depending on their addictions, the supports they need, the barriers they face , the places they are in their lives, and other factors . Many participants pointed out that achieving recovery can be a long, arduous process that requires persistency. Complex Views of 12-Step Programs Due to peoples' familiarity with and the availability of AA and NA, a significant number of individuals had tried these programs. Some participants had participated in AA or NA infrequently, while others had committ ed themselves fully to the program. Many of the participants held strong views about these programs, both positive and negative. Several viewed 12-step programs as the best way to sustain recovery, due to their immediate support systems, the structure that the programs provide, and the Working Draft Page 20 \"There were a few things that appealed to me about AA. The only requirement to being in AA is the desire to stop using. It was the first place where I felt like I was accepted unconditionally.\" -Cab Drive r, CA continuing commitment required. Many participants discussed the fellowship they received from other members of the self- help group. A male participant in the younger adult Albany group explained how important AA was to him: I found [my 12-step program] to be a huge tool in my recovery process. Young people around my age offered peer- to-peer support. That was huge. If I didn' t have people around me that wanted to recover, I can guarantee I wouldn't be sitting here doing this today. It was vital. For him, the 12 -step program allowed a connection with others in the same position. The man quoted above connected well with the fellowship because it included young people, but younger people can also have a more difficult time finding a 12-step group that meets their needs, because youth groups are far less available. A young woman shared her experience of reaching out to 12-step programs i n her rural area and feeling ostracized in an AA group because of her age, the fact that she was newly sober, and her having been a previous drug user. She said that it felt very cliquey to her and that in the end she stay ed away from AA in her path to recovery, which included residential treatment and online support. Other participants did not experience exclusion, but felt a lack of connection , realizing immediately that it was not the place for them. One man puts it this way: I was put in AA and NA. J ust going there didn't do it for me at all. I often felt every single time that I went there that I was hearing the same sob story ... And I just got tired of it. The range of views on 12-step programs was very diverse. Some viewed these programs as a place where people sometimes hide out ; others felt the program was a good place to learn how to handle one's disease. Some found the program inviting, and others found it to be exclusive. While AA/NA evokes very different reactions in different people, the participants agreed that it is an important program that helps many people. Barriers and Supports On every participant's pathway to healing/recovery there were a multitude of barriers and supports that aided or slowed down the recovery process. Participants were quick to share stories from both experiences and to point out that many of the same items appeared on the lists of barriers and supports. Barriers Family Friends Stigma and shame Fear Lack of resources in high school Lack of insurance Police and criminal justice system Child Protective Services and inability to see children Wrong programs and lack of programs Media Working Draft Page 21 \"I have the biggest support system ever. On visitation days, it was like a family reunion.\" - Nursing School Student, IL Supports Family Friends Community Insurance Therapy/therapists Spiritual teachers School Emergency room Drug court Police and criminal justice system For some, the same entities served personally as both a barrier and a support ; for example, many people listed their family or the criminal justice system as both a barrier and a support. Another item appear ing on both lists is insurance. One woman experienced an obstacle involving insurance when she tried to reach out and get help. She felt it was very important that she attend an inpatient program after other pathways had failed, but her insurance company did not consider her condition severe enough for inpatient services, and would not authorize payment for treatment. However, another woman in the same focus group had a very different experience with her insurance company: she called them when she was out of other alternatives, and they immediately connected her to several affordable treatment options. A common barrier for youth is the lack of age-appropriate services and supports. Younger participants discussed receiving services that were not designed for adolescents. They said they had been admitted to psychiatric facilities that did not understand their addictions. Participants who spent time in these facilities as adolescents express ed the belief that these facilities are not suitable environments for treating alcohol and drug problems, and can further complicat e rather than treat problems. Many participants also point ed to their networks as both positive and negative forces in their recovery process. One participant said that her high school, including her teachers and her friends, was a huge barrier. She sa id, The thing that made it a barrier was that nobody wanted to [help], there were no resources for me to go to. She tried to reach out to her immediate community at the time and no one directed her to any kind of treatment. Other participants were more successful \u2014for example, one young woman found support in her college when an educator reached out to her and she realized for the first time that she had an addiction. For many, family was very important. Families in most cases provided tremendous support and encouragement. The strong presence, love, and support of family helped individuals in their efforts to get better and stay better. Along with the more traditional networks, online networks are becoming increasingly important to the recovery process. Although participants infrequently indicated families or on-line support as a primary or secondary pathway, they Working Draft Page 22 \"There is stigma in some small, privately held companies because they know [from] insurance claims who went [to rehab], and whos costing the company money.\" -Corporate VP, PA often mentioned them as important supports. The young er adults in particular spoke of the connections they have made online and how important they continue to be. For some in more rural areas, online connections provide the opportunity to connect with young people when it is difficult to make connections locally. Many felt that online peer networks will become increasingly beneficial in the future. Messages t o the Public and Policymakers Participants wanted to communicate to the public and policymakers what they have learned from their personal recovery. They wished to educate the public about the facts related to addiction, to inform policymakers about the importance of treatment and prevention, and to raise awareness that addiction is a disease from which people can recover . Too often, they explain ed, the public holds very inaccurate views of what addiction and recovery/healing mean. Stigma and Discrimination Participants express ed the view that there is stigma and discrimination against those with addiction to alcohol and other drugs, and even those who are healed and/or in recovery. One woman explained that her boss would try to discharge people in her company if he found out they had suffered from an addiction, and that she kept her own problems a secret until attending the focus group in NYC. Discrimination often continues many years after people get better. One man sa id the most important factor for policymakers to understand is that people do get better. He shared his experience of going through a nine-month hiring process in which he disclosed his history with addiction. At the conclusion of the process, it was determined that he was too much of an employment risk. He fe lt strongly that he was discriminated against because of his past addiction. His desire was for the public and policymakers to give people in recovery a fair opportunity to succeed. The need for widespread education about the disease of addiction was at the forefront of messages that participants want the public and policymakers to receive. Participants felt it is critical for the public to understand what addiction is and what recovery means, along with the methods to treat addiction and the challenges individuals experience. They believed that by helping society understand that addiction is a disease, stigma can be reduced. They suggested that education be provided through strategies including public awareness campaigns, school outreach programs, and web-based resources. Prevention The participants also discussed the value of prevention, particularly targeted to youth . Participants spoke of the importance of helping others with addictions and of prevent ing others from experiencing the illness and suffering associated with addiction. One man commented , I think the country, [and] the city, needs to work more on alcohol and substance abuse prevention in the schools. People should be Working Draft Page 23 hired to provide prevention in elementary schools. That's where it can be most effective. We talk about recovery. It's too late then. He felt very strongly, and was supported by others, that the most effective recovery is prevention. Treatment and Recovery Support Services Respondents expressed strong support for both traditional and alternative treatment, including inpatient, outpatient and yoga, meditation, etc. Participants also wanted policymakers to be aware of the lack of knowledge within the general heal th care community about how to recognize, treat and refer patients with substance use problems. They felt that it was important that general health care providers be trained to assist in reaching people in need of help. In addition to treatment services, participants discussed the value of and need for recovery support services, such as employment services, housing, and educational services. These services are critical to improving an individual's quality of life and ability to achieve and sustain recovery. Participants mentioned a range of recovery supports they viewed as essential, including peer recovery coaching, child care, and transportation. The participants also emphasized the need for supports for specific populations, including adolescents and people involved with the criminal justice system. Participants discussed the importance of student-assistance programs, recovery centers for adolescents, and age-appropriate support groups for adolescents . They discussed the need for recovery support services for individuals reentering the community from the criminal justice system \u2014specifically , peer recovery coaches, vocational training, help with parenting, anger management classes, and legal assistance . Treatment Options in Lieu of Incarceration Participants want ed the public and policymakers to know that they are not criminals, but rather suffer from a medical illness. Individuals expressed the importance of providing treatment options in lieu of incarceration to improve the health and safety of communiti es. Participants particularly emphasized this point when discussing adolescents and young er adults. They want ed young people to be offered treatment for their disease in order to intervene in the multi-generation al cycle of addiction. One man said, ... young kids are suffering from addiction and alcoholism. They are our future and it seems to me that there are more and more kids getting into drugs at an early age ... there needs to be funding for prevention and rehabilitation. I think they just throw them into jails, throw them into juvenile centers. He said that young adults should take responsibility for their actions, but also should be given the opportunity to get better. Several participants also discussed the barriers that a criminal record can create, such as difficulty obtaining a job, or feeling unwelcomed in a community. Unfortunately, these additional barriers can jeopardize an individual's well -being and recovery. Participants want ed policymakers and the public to acknowledge addiction as a medical condition and to decriminalize substance use. Working Draft Page 24 Recovery is Possible Participants want ed to communicate to the public and policymakers that recovery and healing from addiction is possible. They felt that it is important for more individuals who are in recovery/healing to speak openly about their experiences so that others can learn and receive inspiration from them. While participants said that the experience can be hard and sometimes filled with temporary setbacks, they believe that with determination and support, recovery is achievable. Participants also stated that they received support from many individuals throughout their recovery process. They express ed gratitude for those who helped them, and were very thankful for their health and life in recovery/healing . As one respondent stated , Recovery is about being in a better place and being happier than before. Conclusion This is the first study of its kind. Its examination of a diverse group of people and the myriad of approaches used in their recovery process makes clear there is no one method or single pathway to recovery/healing. The study participants cited 18 different pathways to recovery, providing a new level of understanding about this subject. Many of the pathways discussed in this report have never been studied by the research community, yet indications are they play a significant role in how people recover. Recovery is a personal and complex process, and an approach that succeeds for one person may not work for another. Success typically depends on finding the right mix of services and supports that meet the specific needs of an individual. Furthermore, many individuals and systems in a person's life , ranging from family members to the criminal justice system, may help or hinder recovery or may hinder it at one point and help it at another. The one theme that emerged consistently besides the sheer diversity of experiences that respondents described is that recovery is possible, is a profoundly positive experience, and that it equates with quality of life. Respondents emphasized the need to view addiction as an illness rather than a crime or a weakness, remove the stigma attached to addiction and those in recovery from it, and make traditional and non-traditional treatment options available to those who need them.

Introduction a. Study Description and Background Welcome, and thank you for coming. My name is _________, and I will be leading our discussion today; ___________ will be taking notes. We are assisting Abt Associates, a research organization, in conducting a study for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration through the Department of Health and Human Services. This focus group is part a study to learn more about the experiences and needs of people who have used drugs, alcohol, or both. b. Purpose of Focus Groups We will be asking about what your experience has been. We are interested in both your experiences with people that were important to you throughout your journey toward better health, as well as your interaction with organizations that provide assistance and services. The information you give us will be used to better understand experiences of persons with a history of substance use and the personal journeys they have taken. By having a better understanding of these issues, more effective services and supports can be provided to help others who have used alcohol and drugs. Working Draft Page 28 c. Consent and Confidentiality Your participation in this focus group is voluntary, and will have no effect on any services you receive. If there are any questions that you do not want to answer, you may simply pass and not answer. We want to hear about your experiences and opinions, but if there are any questions you prefer not to answer, that's absolutely fine. There is no pressure to speak on any topic. We will use what we learn from this group and others as part of a report on the experiences of persons. The report will not contain any individual names or details that could identify specific people. We will also ask that you consider what others discuss here as confidential. We would like to tape record this session as a backup to our written notes. Only my project team will use these tapes, and they will be destroyed immediately after we complete the study. If anyone prefers that we do not tape, you may choose to not participate in the session but instead receive a follow-up telephone call. d. Logistics In the discussion today, I will be asking questions about your experiences and opinions. There are no right or wrong answers. We are interested in hearing about both what has worked well and what might be done differently. We've got a lot of questions for you, and my job will be to keep the discussion moving along so we can cover them all. However, I hope you will be doing most of the talking. There is no need to raise your hand before speaking, but we need for one person to talk at a time, so we can get everything you're telling us. Feel free to help yourselves to more refreshments during the group. Are there any questions on anything I've told you so far? Start Tape Recorder! 2. Introductions I'd like to start by asking you to introduce yourselves. Please tell us your first name and something about the past substance use and current situation. Probe to get picture of past use and current situation Participants may relate how they came into \"recovery\"; encourage with your response, but don't press for details. Note any details of specific pathways to help introduce topic later. Note what terms participants use to refer to recovery. Working Draft Page 29 3. Defining Recovery and Other Terms Q1. If indicated: [Some of you have referred to being in recovery.] Many people who have used drugs and alcohol in the past refer to being in recovery. Recovery, however, is a term that means different things to different people. For our discussion today, we ask you to think about your past use and your current situation today. How do you define or describe where you are in your life right now? Do not offer specific words, but probe for terms used to describe current situation (e.g., better, clean and sober, healing, surviving, stable, on the right path, etc.) Probe for how length of time contributes to the definition Probe for how use, abuse, and dependence contribute to the definition Q2. If possib le, use examples from earlier discussion, i.e., __________ talked about how he had stopped using many times before but that this time was different. Do you think people can reach this stage in their lives and then begin using again? Do not provide words or examples, but probe whether participants believe you can relapse or have a reoccurrence after being \"in recovery.\" Working Draft Page 30 3A. Pathways Now I would like to talk about some of your specific experiences as you moved from your substance use to where you are today. Q1. Now that we have discussed what \"recovery\" means, I would like to talk about how people get there. There are many ways people can get clean and sober. What do you think are the main ways people get [insert terminology used]? Do not offer suggestions, but probe for pathways (e.g., natural recovery, faith -based services, self -help groups, detoxification, specialty treatment, private p ractitioner, physician, criminal justice involvement, medication -assisted, etc.) Thinking about your own life or others you may know, what are other ways people get better? What else helps people who are facing this problem? Q2. If possible, list some of the pathways discussed above. Talk to me about the strengths and weaknesses of different pathways. In what ways do you think it makes sense to combine different pathways? Probe for discussion on relapse - if some pathways are more prone to relapse or eventual success than others Probe for multiple pathways working together Probe for pros and cons of various pathways What does it mean to say a particular pathway is a \"good fit\" with someone? How do people find the pathway that is right for them? Q3. Let's combine these two topics, recovery and pathways, that we have been discussing. In what ways would you say these pathways are more or less prone to relapse or reoccurrence? In what ways are these pathways more or less appropriate for someone who has ha d a relapse or reoccurrence? Working Draft Page 31 4. Barriers 5. Supports 6. Measuring Recovery Q4. From your experiences, what are barriers to getting better? Participants may want to talk about themselves as a barrier. This is a valid response, but we are most interested in external barriers to recovery. If the part icipant talks about themselves as a barrier try to probe for: - what services acted as barriers (e.g., lack of transportation, limited service availability, no insurance/no money, etc.) - what people served as barriers (e.g., past using friends, parents that d id not believe in treatment, treatment did not provide age appropriate services, etc.) Q5. From your experiences, what promotes getting better? This question may promote lengthy answers. Make sure to give all participants a chance to speak. Q6. We ma y have already mentioned some of these, but what services and/or people supported you getting better? Probe for - what services supported \"recovery\" (e.g., regular self -help meetings, community services, faith services, etc.) - what people supported getting better (e.g., sponsors, supportive parents, physicians, exercise, meditation, etc.) Q7. What is better or different about your life now compared to when you were using drugs and/or alcohol? Probe for: employment, better health, education, stable friends, relationships with family, etc. Q8. What is better or different about the lives of your families and friends? Probe for specific examples Working Draft Page 32 We have talked at length about your past experiences while using drugs and/or alcohol and how you have reached the place you are in your lives today. I would like to spend some time now talking about recommendations you have for improving current support for those persons currently using drug and/or alcohol who want to change and get better. 7. Recommendations and Closing Q12. What does the public need to understand about recovery? Q13. What do policymakers need to understand about recovery? Those are all the questions we have for you. Are there any topics we haven't covered that you think are important to mention? It's been a pleasure to talk with you today. We appreciate your taking the time to talk with us. Thank you for taking the time and sharing your experiences with us. Q9. Tell me more about the kinds of help that would support persons who want to change their drug and/or alcohol use and get better? Probe for specific examples Q10. Tell me more about the kinds of help that would support persons who are in recovery? Probe for specific examples Q11. Thinking about the things we've talked about, how would you change things to he lp more people? Probe for specific examples: - Are there changes to the current service system that you would make? - Are there supports you would recommend making available?
