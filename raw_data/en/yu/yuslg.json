BCG vaccine is considered safe, with serious systematic adverse events following immunization (AEFI) of immunocompetent recipients being rare, although adverse event rates vary between differing BCG strains. In Victoria, Australia, AEFI are reported to SAEFVIC (Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Vaccination In the Community), an enhanced passive surveillance system operational since 2007.
