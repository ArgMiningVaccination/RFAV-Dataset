This complete protocol serves as the starting place for all other DesBio programs, including other forms of detoxification and our Evolution Weight Management Program. All six DesBio homeopathic remedies are constructed with 6 dierent phases of homeopathy (plants, minerals, catalysts, phenolics, bowel nosodes AND sarcodes) put together in Desbiochords and Burgi group serial dilutions for enhanced eectiveness. Start your detoxification program with the DesBio Comprehensive Detox. Each DesBio detox tincture uses natural ingredients like plants and minerals to clear out your pathways, draining toxins and heavy minerals from your body. This prepares your body for weight loss and extended detox programs. The DesBio detox kit comes with six different tinctures \u2014 everything you need to purify your system. Using this homeopathic detox kit is simple. Add the recommended amount to your water bottle, then drink the water throughout the day. If you're trying to lose weight, this complete detoxification kit releases toxins that come from fat. You'll purify your system and continue with your weight loss program without compromising your health. Every good weight loss program begins with an effective detoxification. The body's non-essential fat reserves store toxic substances. Our body's fat reserves serve as a storage unit for heavy metals and other toxins as a defense mechanism to remove them from circulation in the body. As your body loses weight (solubilizes the fat), those toxins are then released into the body and the body's elimination systems can be bombarded with toxins. The Comprehensive Detox Kit provides detoxification and drainage support, so that dieting, fat loss, and toxic load are managed for the duration of the diet. The Comprehensive Detox Kit can be used during dieting or just as a premium detoxification plan for overall health and wellness.
