A: Yes, it is. Please watch your clothes and furniture while using, or cover the affected area with a bandage. Q: Why can't Black Drawing Salve be less messy? Can't you make it a color other than black? A: Unfortunately not. The charcoal is naturally black, and it's important for the drawing properties to be effective. Q: Is this like the 'black salve' the FDA warns against? Isn't this dangerous? A: No. That warning is for bloodroot salve, which should be used only under the care of an herbalist. This is based on charcoal and clay and is very safe. Q: How often can I use Soothing Skin Balm? A: You can use this as often as needed. Q: Is the essential oil roller diluted already? A: Yes! It is diluted in the carrier oil of rosehip seed and is ready for use! Q: I thought gut health was the main contributor to skin issues? How will topical treatments really help? A: Gut health is most definitely a factor with skin conditions. Identifying the root cause is always the most effective help for any condition. But there are times where topical relief is needed and treasured for quick relief! Q: I have another question. How can I get help?
