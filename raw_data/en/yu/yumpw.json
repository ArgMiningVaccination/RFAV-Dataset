These toxins may come from air pollution, processed foods, contact with animals and even the own body can produce toxicants all of which have undesirable short-term or long-term effects on individual health. When we hold onto extra fat cells we potentially will hold onto toxins due to the areas toxins store are in the fat cells and liver. Benefits of detoxing the body of toxins are weight/fat loss, improved insulin resistance, improved sleep quality, boost in immunity, and improved blood pressure; just to name a few. Here at QuickStart we offer a Toxin Detox (blood and liver) & Colon Cleanse and we use wellness products that are naturally made and contain wholesome ingredients that produce a clean and support your body's normal restoration processes.
