The general public has adapted with drive-by birthday celebrations and virtual proms, but we find families are still reeling for wedding and funerals lead by trained professionals. We had no idea that our [\"Performing Rituals\"](https://www.celebrantacademy.org/offers/n9F4TsLo/checkout) course with [Lois Heckmen](http://www.loisheckman.com/) would begin in the middle of a pandemic, but we are finding that the timing has the possibility to be more beneficial to others than we ever could have planned.

One thing we know for sure, it is the ceremony and the ritual(s) performed that individuals, families and guests remember most-- and they NEVER expect it! Rituals are simply part of being human-- daily, annually, or once in a lifetime-- they are part of the fabric that makes for a rich life.
